        We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.   - Paul the Apostle  "Tolerance" is the word of the day when it comes to religion.  No one wants to hear your opinion unless you make the disclaimer that you can "believe what you want."  I guess if no one really believed their own beliefs then that would be acceptable.  However, if you really believe in something you tell people about it.  If the way to eternal happiness could be found by eating a candy bar every day and you knew that to be true, wouldn't you want to tell everyone?  On the other hand, if  ONE  way to eternal happiness was found through anger, suicide bombings, terrorism, hate and sacrifice and  ANOTHER  way to eternal happiness could be found in eating a Snickers, why would you commit to the former when you could just do the latter.  If there are many ways to eternal happiness then why not choose the easiest, or at least the most rewarding of the options.   If  what Jesus said about being "the way, the truth, and the life" and "no one comes to the Father but through me" is true then the attitude of Jesus' followers should be to let everyone know about this Truth and the Way.  It would be unthinkable for someone to withhold information about the cure for AIDS.  In fact, most people believe they are put on this earth to make the world a better place, but when someone tries to share the good news about Jesus Christ they reject that persons willingness to do the very thing they believe we are here on earth to do.  I believe Christians should act like Paul when he said in 2 Corinthians 10:5, "We are destroying speculations."  Christians have the Truth and, by default, all other religions are untruths.  Paul writes about these people in the book of Romans, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened." Romans 1:21    Every religion that contradicts Christianity began with speculations.  Mohammed thought he knew who God was and yet he began speculating that God is a God of hate (rather than love as Christians believe).  Eastern religions tell us that we must blend the good and the bad as some sort of kharma or balance.  The Bible tells us to flee from immorality.  Each of the major world religions has tried to create God rather than worship Him as our Creator.  The theory of evolution is a speculation that all of these religions have grabbed onto to give credence to their ideas.  Even some professing Christians have been snowed under by the sheer ridicule and derision that comes when someone says they believe in Creation.  It is time to stand up for what is right and profess Truth without compromising our convictions.    By the way, don't think that this blog is going to be strictly about "destroying speculations".  However, I can't keep silent about the Truth that I have found.  I believe it is important to arrive at logical, rational conclusions about our faith.

      I have been in seminary for a couple of years and I have been around many conservative, evangelical Christians who actually have no problem with certain words.  Granted, they don't go around saying them often, but they see no problem with the s*word, the d*word, the f*word, etc.  Basically, those who I have talked to about this have given three reasons they don't have a problem saying these words.  1) These are merely words that only have a meaning that society puts on them and in different societies there would be nothing wrong with them.  For example, Americans have no problem with the word  bloody .  In Great Britain, on the other hand, this is just as bad as the f*word.  In Great Britain,  pissing  means drinking, but in America this is a vulgar term for going to the bathroom.  The list of societal words is long, but you get the idea. 2) Many people have said to me that they see no problem with the s*word because there is no rule in Scripture that that is a word we should not use.  There are many words that are considered "curse" words that really are not preached against in the Bible. 3) As Christians, we are free in Christ and if we are among other Christians then there should be no problem with these words.    I believe this topic is an important one for 3 reasons: 1) Our very existence is because of the spoken word. 2) Jesus is the Word and He was with God from the beginning. 3) The Bible warns us of abusive language  I want to answer each of the disagreements that my Christian brothers and sisters have had with me on this issue.  First of all, the argument that these words are not wrong because they are determined by society.  There are a lot of missionaries who spend years studying a culture so that they do not damage their witness by the use of a wrong word or doing an obscene (to that culture) gesture.  Just because society makes the rules doesn't mean we are free to go against them and use objectionable language because what's in a word?  Words are very powerful, and even if it isn't an objectionable word like the s*word, they can still do damage.  Telling someone they are stupid can do a lot of harm.   It is humorous, but depressing to me that my Christian brothers can make this argument when secular TV stations and movie rating systems are the ones bleeping out words or giving a warning not to take certain people to see these movies.  Why do we let a lost world determine standards and then we go and watch something or even go so far as to say something that even lost people say is objectionable.  At that point we have submitted to their measure of morals and we have failed to live up even to that standard.  The Bible tells us to, "Let your speech always be with grace, as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person." (Colossians 4:6) We are also told to, "Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith and purity, show yourself an example of those who believe." (I Timothy 4:12)  Are we setting an example when we let these words come out of our mouth.  Secondly, people have said, there is no s*word commandment in the Bible, but they fail to realize that we are to "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart Be acceptable in Your sight, O LORD, my rock and my Redeemer." (Psalm 19:14)  If we are disciples of Christ then we would want only the words that He would have us say come out of our mouth.  A taste of what the words of God are like are found in Psalm 12:6, which says, "The words of the LORD are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, refined seven times."  Maybe they aren't so bad, but are they pure?    Finally, we are free in Christ so words mean nothing, right?  Wrong! "It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery." (Galatians 5:1)  And, "you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh." (Galatians 5:13)  Don't use freedom as a "get out of jail free" card.  We are told to be an example and we are told to be pure in our thoughts and words.  From the creation of the world God has placed a special emphasis on the spoken word.  We were created by it.  We are comforted by it.  We are confronted by it.  Sometimes we are cursed by it.  Even Peter, Jesus' disciple, when he wanted to prove that there was absolutely NO alignment between him and that Jesus fellow, used curse words to reject his Lord.  "Then he began to curse and swear, 'I do not know the man!' And immediately a rooster crowed." (Matthew 26:74)  If that weren't enough, the Bible tells us that, "by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned." (Matthew 12:37)  If there is a question about whether it is right or wrong to say a certain word, just don't say it.  Our reputation as the light-bearers in this world is on the line and you are destroying it with your careless word.  Why else would Paul exhort Timothy in this way, "In all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified, 8 sound in speech which is beyond reproach,  so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.   There is power in speech, let's use it wisely.    Here are some verses in scripture that I find helpful when thinking about God's will for our speech: Ge 1:3; Le 19:12; Ps 12:6; Ps 19:14; Ps 59:12; Pr 4:5; Pr 4:24; Pr 10:19; Pr 17:20; Pr 19:1; Pr 26:2; Ec 5:6; Ec 6:11; Ec 12:11; Isa 29:13; Isa 50:4; Isa 59:13; Jer 7:9; Ho 10:4; Mt 5:22; Mt 12:36; Mt 12:37; Mt 24:35; Mt 26:74; Mt 27:44; Mr 14:71; Lu 9:26; Ro 3:4; 1Co 2:13; Eph 5:6; Col 3:8; Col 4:6; 1Th 4:18; 1Ti 4:12; 1Ti 6:4; Tit 2:6-8; Jas 3:9; Jas 5:12

      There are a lot of ideas as to what worship really is in a corporate setting.  Worship is not a concert unless the audience consists of one being: God.  I have jotted down a few of my thoughts on the matter and invite any discussion on the subject.  I believe that corporate worship should include only that music which motivates a particular congregation to worship God.  Different generations, ethnic groups, and other demographic factors may contribute to different styles of worship.  It's hard for me to believe that punk rock could encourage someone to worship but I wouldn't eliminate the thought because I haven't been immersed with that kind of music and culture.  I think there are some principles to music that are important for worship: (1) The music should allow for introspection and adoration. (2) The music is not distracting (which I'm inclined to think the punk rock guitar solos would be, but I've heard of some growing inner-city churches that use that music medium in their worship services). (3) The message (either to the singer or from the singer) does not contradict Biblical Truths.  As far as the repetition of music, I personally don't want to repeat a song over and over.  My limit is to sing a song that has only one verse and chorus through about two times.  There are actually some really great songs that do this.  Then there are the really simple songs that really have no substance to them.  I went to an Assemblies of God church one time and after I got tired of one of their songs in particular I looked at the time and from that point on they continued to sing for at least 6 more minutes.  The really disturbing part about it was the song had 3 phrases and about 2 lines of melody that the people kept singing over and over again jumping up and down.  I couldn't help but get the impression (since a big group had gathered around the altar waving their hands) that they were conscious of people watching because they would stop jumping up and down or put their arms down to rest and then (was that a hint of frustration I saw) continue with renewed zeal.  I may have been imagining things but that is what it looked like.  Actually, most of the really good new praise songs have 2 verses and a chorus and sometimes even a bridge.  Traditional hymns aren't without fault either.  I remember getting tired of singing 4 verses of a hymn and repeating the chorus those 4 times.  Then there is the high church music.  There have been times I have been in awe when choirs sing songs like The Hallelujah Chorus which is quite repetitive.  One time, though, I heard a choir sing a song entitled "Kyrie Eleison" which I was not fond of.  You know how I know the title?  Those were the only words in the whole song.  My conclusions about repetition are that a worship leader or pastor should decide what music to use based on what he can worship to (and at times music that at least he doesn't dislike) and also what the focus group finds worshipful.  I have heard some suggest that there should be music with the words so that everyone can sing along.  I hadn't thought much about that and don't know how important that is.  I understand the thought because we want to allow seekers to be involved in the service.  An unbeliever comes in and is pretty much at a loss most of the time.  However, if an unbeliever comes in and sees people truly worshipping then that is a benefit of choosing music that encourages worship from the believers.  Even with music behind the words a believer may have trouble at first until he/she has heard the song through.  I guess the early church just taught each other songs the best they could as they met in each others houses.  Again, the best worship songs are those that have a memorable, enjoyable tune and don't require a degree in music to be able to accomplish singing the melody.  Having said all of that, worship isn't created in a room.  All any of these songs do, whether repetitive or punk rock, or "Kyrie Eleison", is allow a person to sing...unless the believer has been exhibiting a lifestyle of worship throughout the week.  Things like raising hands or shutting eyes or lying prostrate during the worship time is only people-pleasing unless the individual is actually lost in their fellowship and worship with God.  Obviously, there is a lot to think about when it comes to worship and these are just a few of my own thoughts, some are in response to conversations I have had.  As one great thinker said, "In matters of style, swim with the current.  In matters of principle, stand like a rock."

      For thousands of years, people have been going to places of higher learning to get theological training and they probably will for a thousand more. I, for one, will never again be a traditional full-time seminary student.  I spent the last two years working on a seminary education and I feel like much of that time has been wasted.  My first complaint against seminary training is that the typical student begins to live a cloistered lifestyle that is cut off from contact with the culture.  Any other graduate degree would be anywhere from thirty to sixty hours and a full load would be about nine hours.  Not so for the seminary student.  If the student is going full time (which in this case that would be at least 12 hours), it would take about three years to get a 100 hour degree Master of Divinity.  Many seminary students work in churches or with Christian organizations so even while they are doing some ministry they are spending a dangerously high percentage with only Christian people.  To compound this problem, most seminaries are at least 10 years behind the times.  They are behind technologically, culturally, and relevantly.  Some seminaries, of course, do a better job than this and others do worse.  However, the point is, by the time the seminary student comes through the indoctrination, they are 10 years behind the culture.  Plus, they have not been personally engaging the culture so add another three or four years on top.  By the time the seminary student enters the world, it is a world that he does not recognize and a world that has already written him off as ineffective.  I am going to pursue a seminary education, but it will be part-time while I am actively engaging the world around me.  I love to read, I love to study, I love to learn, but Jesus changed the world by doing.

      The Princess Bride is my favorite movie of all time. One of the best scenes is when Buttercup is being forced to marry Prince Humperdink (I love the names) against her will. She really loves Westley but he has not come to her rescue. So Buttercup and Humperdink approach the altar as the organ plays. In the majesty and glory of the church the robed clergy turns and faces the bride and groom to embark upon a flowery speech about "wuv - twue wuv". His speech impediment is so out of place in such a majestic, awesome setting that it gets me rolling on the floor every time I see it.   Yesterday, May 17th 2004, was an historic day in our nation's history. The Commonwealth of Massachussetts established legality for same-sex marriages. This is the first state to legalize such unions and it won't be the last unless something is done on a national level. Hundreds of homosexual couples exchanged wedding vows with the full support of the state (and many churches -ie the Unitarian Universalist and others).   Buttercup and Humperdink's wedding proved to be a sham that is really funny. The tragedy that has occurred in Massachussetts is far from humorous. President Bush said, "The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few activist judges." I believe people need to understand that the judicial branch does not define marriage. In effect, the judicial branch broke several state and national laws so that they could make their own law that fits their agenda. This is a complete usurpation of the Republican form of government in our country. The legislature signs laws into existence. A "few activist judges" have effectively changed the law to advance the homosexual cause.   Not only is it important for us to understand the violations the judicial system in Massachussetts committed, it is also important for us to understand that even the legislative branch did not come up with the definition of marriage. The definition of marriage is found in  urlLink Genesis 2:24  which says, "For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh." Throughout the Bible God tells us what a marriage should look like. No matter what the legislature, judiciary or the executive branches decide about this issue. Marriage will always be between a man and a woman.   If two men or two women want to be recognized by the state as a valid couple, don't call it a marriage. For that matter, if  more  than two men or two women (like in Utah) want to get married, don't call it a marriage. If these two people feel some kind of sexual need for each other and certain levels of intimacy, don't call it love. If two men or two women want to adopt a child, don't call it a family. If a congregation chooses to reject the claims of Christ and the Truth that is found in God's Word and prostitute itself to the opinions of this world, then  don't call it a CHURCH . And, if we as a nation wan't God to bless us but we want to turn  to  our wicked ways instead of from them, then don't call this a Christian nation.   Prince Humperdink tried to rush through the ceremony because he was getting nervous that the hero would come in and save his true love. When Buttercup and Westley are reunited she confesses, "I got married, I didn't want to but it all happened so fast." Westley says, "It didn't happen. Did you say, 'I do'?" She says, "No, we sort of skipped through that part." "Then it never happened."   So many people view the church as a failure because we have sold ourselves to the world. You can't look to the church as the example of moral purity anymore. Our divorce rate is just as high as the world's. Our view of marriage is not as pure as it once was. No wonder we have come to a point where marriage is coming to mean so many things and nothing all at the same time. The Lord will soon come for His True Love and He will purify His Bride. I wonder how many in the church right now will be ready for His coming? Will we be a part of a sham marriage to the world or will we keep ourselves pure and holy in His sight? God's plan for marriage, for family, for church, for relationships is perfect. It is a dweam within a dweam.

      I had an epiphany the other day. The conclusion of which is that many of our psychological problems will only increase the longer we abandon God's Word. It seems pretty simplistic and hardly prophetic because we see suicides increasing and more and more people are visiting psychiatric wards with severe problems. Here is a sketch of my epiphany without the evidence to substantiate it because that would take a lot of typing. However, I did want to share this with my readers. I am hoping to spur you on to think this through yourselves.   The basic idea is that our collective postmodern thought is in a direct relationship with the thoughts of Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche was one mind but we see as a whole the same patterns occuring especially in North America (I know it is worse or better in other places but I speak from where I live and observe). That might be a lot to chew on, but he is regarded as the founder of postmodernism. Here's what I have discovered about his life:  Nietzsche was severely tormented psychologically first of all and we see a massive amount of people who suffer from psychosis today.  Even in his own writings he contradicted himself over and over especially in matters of faith. The trend today is that there is no absolute truth which is a contradiction in terms. How can you say absolutely that there is no truth? That, in itself, is an absolute truth which disproves the statement. It is common now for one person to have one belief about God that completely contradicts another belief about Him even in the same world-view and they don't seem to have a problem with it.  Nietzsche committed suicide and the suicide rate sky-rocketed when evolution replaced creation in the public school systems and prayer and the Bible were rejected.  Nietzsche predicted that if people were to believe his writings then the next century would be the bloodiest century in history (that was written towards the end of the 19th century around the time Darwin and Marx were writing and a little bit after Freud. Guess what happened in the 20th century?) Mayhem, death and genocide are the natural consequences of lawlessness and atheism.  Hitler based his Aryan supremacy on Nietzsche's "Ubermensh" or Super Man concept.  As a result, I believe that a lot of our psychotic, paranoid, demented, contradictory thought in society comes from our rejection of God and it is interesting to see this illustrated in the thoughts of Nietzsche. It's almost as if the unordered, contradictory aphorisms of Nietzsche's mind are being personified and lived out vicariously through todays culture.  Nietzsche rejected God, now look at his life. Our society collectively rejects God, now look at our society. They look very similar.

        Recently I was challenged in the area of Bible verse memorization.  The Bible does say, after all, that we are to treasure God's words in our hearts ( urlLink Psalm 119:11 ).  If we could know at least five verses with their references for every year that we have been a Christian, that would be a good start.  For me that would be 105 verses that I should know by now.  I know a lot, but I'm not sure if I know that many.  How can a believer say that he trusts God's Word, that he loves God with all of his heart, soul, mind, and strength, that he wants to do God's will, and that he desires to share his faith if he can't even recite a mere 5 verses for every year he has been a believer.  I have been challenged to do better about memorizing scripture, not only to be able to recite it on command, but also to let it seep into my being and change me from the inside out.

      There is an incredible verse in Ezekiel that says, "So was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." ( urlLink Ezekiel 1:28 ) This is such an incredible verse.   Imagine knowing about someone who you really want to meet. It could be the president or an actor or a Nobel prize winner. Some might be honored to have a statue of that person to remind them of their character or their fame. That statue would undoubtedly cast a shadow on the wall. The verse in Ezekiel is showing us an appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. Of course, a shadow of a statue of a major world leader is not much to speak about. However, the appearing glimmer of God's glory is remarkable.   This verse tell much about who God is. We are not seeing the fullness of God in this chapter. We are only seeing His glory, no, a likeness of His glory. Well, actually, the appearance of the likeness of His glory. We aren't seeing God in this verse but we are realizing that just a shadow, just a glimpse of a part of who God is is really more than we can see at one time.   I have not been able to post for quite some time because I was coordinating some missions trips in Ecuador. We were able to see many volcanoes in all of their splendor while in Ecuador. While there, someone said, "It would be fun to try and climb that mountain in a day, but it is even more awesome that I know the God who  created  that mountain in a day." Some of the people in Ecuador worship nature and they find their God's in the flowers and in the mountains. How much better to worship the God who created the flowers and the sun and the mountains. I don't worship the appearance or the shadow of some likeness. I worship the God whose shadow is too holy to gaze upon.

      I didn't include politics as one of my topics of discussion but don't think I won't talk about it.  I watched John Kerry give his acceptance speech at the DNC in Boston tonight and I was disturbed by some things he said.  Overall, I believe John Kerry is an excellent communicator.  I thought he was calling the kettle black when he said, "My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks."  In his speech, John Kerry remarked that, "Values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families."  I definitely agree and I am disturbed by how the family is degenerating to something that is undefined and chaotic.  I was very interested to hear what John Kerry had to say about family values, but everything he said about valuing families had to do with providing them with health care and body armor when they go off to war.  There was nothing about the morality of the family.  Which is exactly what was missing from the Kerry speech - the real issues.  He said a lot about the military and the middle class and health care and new jobs, but where was the talk about the integrity of marriage (oh yeah, he and his running mate were the only two senators who didn't have the courage to share where they stood on that issue)?  What is his plan on abortion?  What is his plan for the family?  If values are what we live by then what are his?  He said, "I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. "  What are those values, John Kerry?  And by the way, was John Kerry a veteran or wasn't he? "...when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service. " "...but because of what we learned as soldiers." "We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra." "I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place..." "I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president." "I fought under that flag..." "But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day..." "I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta..." We get the point!  Anyway, John Kerry would be a great president if he didn't believe in big government, and wasn't an immoral person, and didn't want to support stem cell research, and if he did have a problem with same-sex marriage, and didn't rip off President Bush's speech because he doesn't have one otherwise, and would let his wife think for herself (she was Republican when she was married to a Republican).  In short, he would be a great president if he were a conservative Republican.

      September 16th, 2003 an old friend of mine sent this email to me:    I'm still working at the church. We're going through some major transition there right now though. Our pastor and his family are moving to another ministry position. After A LOT of prayer and seeking God's Word and counsel, I'm going to take over as the Pastor/Planter. We've been reaching mostly college students without that being our main target age, so we're going to re-focus our efforts and become a collegiate church plant (there are roughly 20,000-25,000 college students locally to our church). Wild huh? It's really crazy how God has worked this all out. I'm very excited about what the Lord is going to do through this, it's just a scary feeling knowing that there isn't anyone else above you where the main responsibility of the church can fall on.  You know...the thought just occurred to me...if you really felt God speaking to you, you could move up here and co-pastor this with me. :-)  Just a thought.  Anyway, in all seriousness, I probably will be looking for someone to come beside me and help me out in the teaching dept...though it will probably be a while, unless God moves or instructs otherwise.   At that time of my life I was voluntarily leading a college ministry in my church, working full-time as Athletic Director at a school and going to seminary.  I was not thinking about moving.  I wrote my friend back with an email stating I appreciated the (what I thought was a half-serious) offer but I was content where I was.  Soon after, I began feeling a discontentment.  The college ministry was bland, I wasn't making enough at my job to cover basic expenses and I even decided to take the next semester off from seminary because I was so bored with the classes.  What I didn't know is that God was preparing me to move.  The discontentment began to grow heavily.  Bills that I couldn't pay were coming in rapidly, seminary was the last thing on my mind and I had no satisfaction at my job (I was only working there to put myself through school.  God called me to preach and in the absence of any opportunities in my area I took this job).  Soon I was looking for other options.  I wrote down all the things I wanted to do; start a church (I had no funds), work with college students (there were no positions available), go full time with a youth ministry organization I was involved with (no paid position), continue with the AD job (no satisfaction, not enough money).  I even wrote down the position in New England my friend had mentioned in his email, not even knowing that was an option still available to me.  After I had written down about 8 things, the only one I couldn't cross off the list was the position in New England.  All of this time (a period of several months) I had been praying heavily for my friend and his church not realizing that God was burdening my heart for this area and this church.  I kept this information under wraps for awhile until the "divine discontent" became unbearable.  February 25th, Ash Wednesday, I spent fasting and praying the entire day.  The biggest burden on me was, "Lord, if you want me to continue here you will have to provide and give me the assurance that this is your plan.  If you want me to go to the ends of the earth then, once again, I need that assurance.  Send me anywhere, just let me serve you faithfully."  That night I went to see The Passion which completely solidified  my  passion to do whatever the Lord commanded.  The very next day, Thursday, February 26th at about 10:30AM, my friend called me from New England.  He said, "Nathan, I haven't been able to get you off of my heart and I want you to seriously pray about coming up here.  I don't know if that means a couple of years from now after you finish seminary, or if that means soon, but for some reason God keeps placing your name in my mind."  He also gave a little description of what would be involved.  Basically, he said I would  move  to New England and co- pastor  a  collegiate  church  plant  (the purpose of the bold type is explained below).  The whole time he was talking I began to sense that God was definitely telling me to go to New England (actually when I recognized the number I knew).  I told him I would call him in a week and let him know what I was thinking and I only said that because I hardly ever make spur of the moment decisions.  It was pretty obvious at this point that soon I would be in New England.  During that week of prayer I wanted to solidify this call from God (as if the circumstances described above weren't enough):  I received this revelation from God over the next couple of days:  There are four areas of ministry that have always been strong on my heart since God called me to preach.  One area is that of  missions .  I am committed to getting people involved in short term mission projects and have been on several projects myself.  I also believe a church should be missiological in nature and finally, I have been made it my commitment to go wherever God leads.  The second area is that of  pastor .  I have known since my freshman year in college that one day I would pastor a church.  The third area is  collegiate ministry .  I have been working with college students for almost 5 years now and believe it is the most over-looked mission field in North America (as well as the most important).  This is my people group that I feel drawn to minister to.  The last area is  church planting .  While I have no formal training in this area I have done a lot of reading and research on my own because for two or three years now I have felt like God has been preparing me to start churches.  I have come to realize that church planting is one of the greatest strategies we have for multiplying evangelism.    If you look at my four passions (in bold) and scroll up to compare them with my friends one sentence description (also in bold) of the ministry in New England you will see how supernaturally God has been preparing me for this particular ministry at this particular time.  I think of Ephesians 2:10 which says, "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which  God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them ."  There is so much more that God has done in the months since February 26th that I will share in subsequent posts.  I am still on a journey and I want to use this blog to encourage other ministers, equip believers, and motivate anyone who cares to read my posts to good works which God has prepared for you.  Until the next time.

      I am a collegiate church planter in the New England area.  Over the next few days I will be catching you up on my journey to become a church planter.  I am embarking on an adventure that God has ordained.  I hope to keep you informed of the struggles and victories I will encounter as I journey through this endeavor.  Many times I will probably regurgitate something that I have read or heard somewhere, but I will try to reference any sources that I remember that I use.  Recently I have been studying about the church directly from the New Testament.  If some of the things I write sound familiar, it could be that the ultimate source for my ramblings is found in Scripture.    With this weblog I will share my vision, strategies, goals, and the steps I take to achieve them.  I will probably do the wrong thing at times, but as a whole I am striving to let my steps be ordered by the Lord.  Email me if you have any questions, suggestions or exhortations.  I would love the input.

      At the end of my "Week of Decision", I called TJ and told him I was coming and that I thought it might be towards the end of July.  He got excited and I got excited and we began planning a time that I could come up to New England to meet with him.  The hurdles to this objective included the price of a plane ticket and food for the weekend.  Within a couple of days, God had already answered these prayers for me.  TJ called and told me that the BCM would pay for a ticket and that TJ and his wife would take care of any expenses during the week I was up there and we began planning for me to come Easter weekend.  Over the next couple of weeks as I was anxious to go to New England I began preparing questions for TJ and also began working on my own philosophies of matters relating to the church.  I especially began studying the New Testament with one objective:  to really understand what the New Testament church was doing that was so effective.  Some of these studies I had been thinking about and reading about and praying about for years.  Over the years I have been led to believe that a church based on programs cannot be effective.  10% of the church might be stocking all of the programs of the church and the other 90% that come on Sunday morning do just that, come on Sunday morning. (You realize that 82.5% of all statistics are made up right?)  I have thought that I would base a church on the cell group principles.  After all, the early church met from house to house caring for each other and distributing resources to whoever was in need.  Another thing I have realized is that the current organizational structure that many protestant churches use is found nowhere in the Bible.  The New Testament had the least amount of structure that it could get by with and equipped everyone for the work of ministry.  My particular denomination uses deacons as leaders in the church and the pastor is the minister.  Instead the pastor/elders should provide leadership to equip the saints and there should be those within the congregation who are identified as servers or helpers (if not all of them).  This simple model as described in Ephesians 4 and I Timothy 3 is very effective for equipping the saints.  It is a tragedy when 90% of the congregation comes to warm a pew and expects a few of the deacons and elders to do all of the work.  I realize I am just giving a brief description of my beliefs here, but right now I am telling the story of my journey.  There will be a more thorough description of New Testament principles later.  From March 4th until April 9th when I would go to New England to visit with TJ I prayed, I studied, I dreamed, and I prayed some more.  God was revealing truths to me and I even spent some time in introspection thinking about my own strengths and weaknesses.  Most importantly, God began showing me how He had led me to this very ministry through my own SHAPE as Rick Warren calls it.  I have already shown how the four passions of my heart (missions, shepherding, collegiate ministry, and church planting) coincided perfectly with this new work in New England.  There were other areas that I began to realize were there to equip me for this very work.  It's amazing that as I began to think about my background, hardly any of my "expertise" came from my degree in religion or in my graduate work at seminary.  I began to realize that the books I had read about church planting, theology, apologetics, philosophy, and even the classics would be an extraordinary help in New England.  My experience leading worship, preaching and teaching Bible studies, leading youth and college students on missions projects, my work with campus ministries, with International World Changers, with No Compromise Student Ministries, my work in local churches and etc. were just the right kind of experience that I needed.  As I thought about the people God has put in my life and my background I was blown away at how God was bringing me to this time and place.    A lot of great things were soon to be in store for me as I traveled to New England for the weekend.  God was going to reveal even more of His perfect ways and I, once again was to be amazed at His power and foreknowledge.  Stay with me, because I want to share what God did as TJ and I met together April 9-12th.

      The past month has seen some great planning and implementation of strategy for the church in New England.  TJ and I have come up with some great ideas for outreach.  We will be developing cell groups and training believers on how to teach.  At this stage in the journey I am still not on the field so TJ and I are doing a lot of calling and emailing.  We are working on a website right now as well as a host of other things that need to be done before next school year.  It is all very exciting and I am learning and studying and praying daily for this new work.  Of course, any movement of God will include some movement by the devil.  Satan has brought on an onslaught of attack against me over the past month or so.  All of it is designed to keep me from this ministry in New England.  I won't be shaken because my trust rests in the Almighty.  An old college professor emailed me today and wrote, "Never doubt in the darkness what God has told you in the light."  I know beyond doubt that I am heading in the direction God has called me.  Now as the shades of darkness seek to engulf me that which is meant to deter me actually is strengthening me.  I know these shadows are meant for evil but God is using them to prove to me that I am on the right track.  Satan is at work wherever God is at work and I believe God is going to do some incredible things.  Part of the reason for this web-log is to encourage other believers who are possibly engaged in the same battles and possibly the same sort of ministry.  Whether that is collegiate ministry or church planting or evangelism, God wants to do great things through each of us.  No matter what you are doing always be prepared to stand firm against Satan's attacks.

      Today I sent out a hundred letters to family and friends.  I have another hundred to send but I didn't have enough money to send all of them.  I am still at a point of uncertainty as to how God is going to make everything happen that needs to happen, but I know it will happen when He wants it to happen...have I said, "happen" enough?  Knowing that I am on the verge of a miracle keeps me motivated to study more, to pray more, and to stay much more focused.  For the last couple of years I really have not accomplished a lot for the kingdom of God.  I think it is because I have not had enough faith that He really wants to use my life for His glory.  Now that I can see Him using me in a mighty way I keep getting more excited about this journey that I am currently on.  Also, today I was asked to be the missions speaker for a camp in July.  I will be able to give a message on "The Call" and then share a bit about my journey to New England.  There will be people who will want to support this endeavor financially and others who will support me prayerfully so I am grateful for the opportunity.  God is giving me more and more opportunities to network with people and to raise support for His kingdom work.  All of that shows His mighty hand of providence.  God is good.

      This past week I had the opportunity of serving as the team leader for the pilot project called ImpactZone through the North American Mission Board.  ImpactZone is a World Changers project that is strictly for college students.  They do housing rehabilitation during the day and leadership training each evening.  I was privileged to work with this project because it gave me more experience working with college students and planning the logistics of a project like ImpactZone.  I was slated to work with this project long before I answered the call to move to the New England area to plant a church that targets college students.  I soon found out at ImpactZone that there were more reasons that God had allowed me to work on this project.  During the week I was able to network with some very important people.  I asked a lot of them to pray for this endeavor in New England and many of them joined my email list to receive ministry and prayer updates.  Not only was I able to speak with many of them, they got excited about my journey and I got to actually spend time with them at lunch or before services.  A few of the more notable men that I met were: Randy Singer - Special Counsel to the NAMB and former Executive VP. Claude Rhea - Chief Development Officer of NAMB and Special Counsel. Chuck Allen - COO of NAMB. Bob Reccord - President of NAMB. I actually never spoke to him about my journey but He called me by name and already knew about it because someone told him about me. Kyle Chowning - Co-founder of Relevant Magazine Foster Friess - Founder of the Brandywine Mutual Funds Mike Day - VP of Strategic Implementation NAMB John Bailey - Director of Student Volunteer Mobilization Jim Burton - Director of Volunteer Mobilization Jonathon Wilson - Director of World Changers/Power Plant/ImpactZone Aaron Coe - The metro New York BCM director Some of these men told me they would forward any email update on to some of their prayer partners also. (I think that's how Bob Reccord found out about this project.  God allowed me to get the word out about my church to some very influential people and even though I don't know the results of that yet, I do know that there are a few more prayer warriors in my corner.  It was amazing how God orchestrated events so that I could network with these people.

      As I continue my journey as a church planter I will encounter a lot of spiritual warfare.  I only know this because it has been happening quite often and with a great deal of intensity.    Two weeks ago all of my finances went crazy.  I had a student loan default and they began taking payments straight out of my checking account.  This led to my inability to pay rent for that month.  That led to having to spend money that I did have on food rather than paying other bills on time.  It was a huge financial domino effect that really hurt.  I began praying that God would provide in those situations.  He wasn't quick about it but He did give me peace about the situation.  I realized that this was not meant for me to doubt my call but for me to rely completely on God for everything.  A former professor of mine emailed me and said, "Never doubt in the darkness what God has spoken to you in the light."  I began to take strength in the fact that I was doing what God wanted and that Satan is upset with that fact.  He obviously knows what I have come to realize, that God can do some great things through me if I rely totally on Him.  In addition to the financial upheaval in my life, at about the same time, my car broke down.  This was a huge inconvenience because I was traveling at the time.  I was about 70 miles from home and no AAA insurance.  However, God answered my prayers because I was trying to determine if I should even have a car in the New England area.  I ended up getting the car towed to a small town shop for $20 because my phone had emergency travel insurance on it.  I then sold the car to them for parts and my parents are letting me use their vehicle for awhile.  I won't need a vehicle much longer though and God has answered that prayer.  Yesterday I flew in from a collegiate World Changers project called ImpactZone in Chicago.  I got paid for my responsibilities there and when I came home I had 4 other checks in the mail.  With that money I am able to pay off some of my late bills and I will be able to pay rent.  God has provided in His time.  He is faithful and even though I sometimes feel I am at the edge of the Jordan river, I know that there is a Promised Land on the other side.  I am closer to God when I can accomplish His will only on His strength.  In fact, I think most of the time His will is only attainable supernaturally.

      Since I will be working primarily with college students, here are some statistics on college life in Boston and especially Boston University (which will be our target campus):   There are 60 colleges and universities in the Boston metro area   There are 250,000 college students   Nearly 2/3's of Boston has at least an undergraduate degree.   Boston leads the nation in the number of PhD's and medical doctors per capita and the total number of Nobel laureates.   Faculty and students of Boston area universities invented anesthesia, the telephone, the digital computer, the instant camera, and the world wide web.   Boston has the oldest university in the US, the first medical school, the first nursing school, the first school of architecture, the first music conservatory, and the first football stadium.   College education is the fourth largest industry in Boston employing 125,000 people and pumping $10 billion dollars into the economy.   Boston University is the nation's third largest private university.   BU has more than 30,000 full or part-time students and more international students than any other US university or college.   BU has the first school of public relations, graduated the first black psychiatrist, first university to open all divisions to women, producing the first woman PhD and first black woman medical doctor.   Alexander Graham Bell taught at BU while developing the telephone and Martin Luther King, Jr, F. Lee Bailey, and Faye Dunaway were graduates.

      I will continue to post entries under the title "The Journey".  However, I have been doing a lot of research that I would like to record.  I believe that any new endeavor requires a lot of research and cultural acclimation.  As part of my journey to Boston, I think it is important to know what I am going to and who I will be working with.  I am keeping up with this research in other places as well, but I thought I would give my readers some of the best of the history, quotes, and especially the facts about my area of ministry.  If you aren't interested then skip over the posts that are titled "The Research".  3._.1 will be historical research 3._.2 will be important quotes 3._.3 will be statistics and facts 3._.4 will be psychological and sociological demographic information   The following is a short history taken from  Insight Guides: Boston  1630 - John Winthrop leads the Arbella and ten other Puritan ships into the Boston Harbor after being assigned as the new governor of the Massachussett's Bay Colony. 1635 - Boston Latin School becomes the  first  public school in the colonies. 1636 - Puritans found a college at New Towne (later to be known as Cambridge).

      This past week I went to the Southern Baptist Convention.  I was able to meet a lot of new people and renew some of my contacts from ImpactZone.  I saw Randy Singer and Mike Day again and they were very encouraging.  I also met this couple who are church planters in St. Louis.  The conversation just happened to turn to where I would be going and what I would be doing and the lady was exuberant in asking me to keep them updated.  They were very excited for me and had words of encouragement and advice.  I got their email and will definitely be following up with them.  They even said they would get on a plane and fly to Boston if I ever needed them.  It was a very warm friendship that developed within a matter of three or four minutes.  One of the very important things that TJ and I want to do as soon as I get to Boston is to develop a website for our church.  I actually got to spend some time with some people who I have worked with in the past.  As I was talking to them I found out that one of them was a website developer.  Once again, God is meeting the needs as they are happening.  Kathy is going to help us (for a much reduced price) to make a very interactive and informative website so that we can communicate with students in Boston better.    On the flight back I sat between two elderly ladies who were also returning home from the convention.  One lady, along with her husband, had been to over 60 countries and was very excited about my missions endeavor to Boston.  She promised to pray for me and wished me the best.  The other lady I already knew and had met at the convention.  As we talked, she also got excited about what I was doing and she suggested that I contact her pastor and mention her name and ask for any support that their church might be able to give us.  As it turns out, it is the very church that the former church planter of The Gate used to attend.  He was even on staff with this pastor and so I have already emailed the pastor to see if they would pray about sponsoring us.    In addition to these, I also was able to see many of my pastor friends and others who I usually only see at the convention each year.  It was a great time of networking and encouragement and once again I see the obvious hand of God in all of it.    When I got back I met up with TJ in Hattiesburg, MS and we ate dinner together.  He and I are both very anxious to be on the field and doing all the things that God is placing on our hearts to do.  He made the comment that there has been too much that has happened for God NOT to do something incredible.  Of course, it may be years of incredibly hard work before we see much fruit, but God is definitely working.

      I just returned from two IWC projects in Ecuador.  I was the ministry coordinator.  Several Quichua children came to know Christ and, as a result of our efforts, thirty churches will be started in Ecuador.  I am currently working on a display and prayer cards for a camp where I will be the missions speaker.  I have used some of my statistics, quotes, and pictures of Boston to make a full color display that I can set up.  I have also created some prayer cards with my name, picture, and contact information.  I am still working on a message to preach on missions day.  There is a lot to do in preparation to move to a completely different area.  I am trying to get a to-do list together and I keep thinking of more things to do.  Changing addresses is going to be a nightmare.    While in Ecuador I gained several more prayer warriors who are lifting me up regularly.  This is the most important thing I can do in preparation to go to Boston.  I am honored to have over 100 people praying for me on a regular basis.  Many of these people are supporting me financially, or have given me things that I will need in Boston like clothes or furniture.  It is amazing to see God work through people.  That's what He does best.

      I have found it very interesting to find that 239 verses in Mark's Gospel are dedicated to telling about Jesus ministering to the lost. Often He was in the marketplace, on the seashore, or teaching people on the hillside. He spoke to people one-on-one and in large groups. He spoke with critics and with the curious. Jesus spent more time with lost people than with anyone else in the Book of Mark.  The next area where Jesus spent his time was teaching His disciples. 157 verses are dedicated to Jesus' time with His disciples teaching them, explaining parables to them and sharing His life with them.  Third, Jesus was in homes. Jesus found it important to spend time in fellowship, eating meals with people, teaching and healing while in homes. Right at 118 verses are dedicated to Jesus' "small group ministry."  Finally, Jesus was in the temple or in the synagogue. With only 97 verses dedicated to actually being in the place of worship, Jesus spent the least amount of His time in the church.  There were also 61 verses that did not give a clue as to Jesus' whereabouts. An example would be the verses that talk about Pilate or the disciples.  A great model of ministry is to spend time in these four areas. If Jesus put the most importance on being with the lost people then we should not close ourselves in our offices (unless they are filled with lost people). We must be in the world, we must train up new leaders, we must participate in small groups, and we should be faithful to the church. This is a great model for ministry from the greatest model we can emulate.

      I am finally in Boston and I have been loving every second of it.  It is amazing how one can be completely free of anxiety when they are sure of being in the center of God's will.  Even though I don't have a plan for covering my expenses, even though I don't have a place to live (I am in a temporary location), even though the future success of this church is difficult for others to believe in, I am stress free.  The only moment of culture shock that I have had is when I discovered that the Boston Globe does not carry B.C. by Johnny Hart in the comics section.  Actually, that is a good indicator of the liberal nature of this city.  Another indicator is how the city is gearing up for the next presidential election.  The Democratic National Convention was in town all of this week and by way of appreciation to the residents of Boston, the University of Massachussetts and the JFK library, as well as the state government and other notables, sponsored a free concert featuring the Boston Pops led by John Williams.  My friends and I had decided we would rather see the Boston Pops than watch the John Kerry speech on C-Span so we hopped on the "T" (the oldest subway in the country) and headed to the concert.  We soon realized that the whole intention of that concert was to get us all in one place so they could make sure we were able to watch the John Kerry speech.   The concert was to be at 8:00PM and by 8:30 they opened with a really horrible band that went on and on and on.  We thought they would never leave the stage.  Around 9:45, and after a good 30 minute wait between bands, the Boston Pops finally came on.  They played about 4 really magnificent songs and then, 20 minutes into the program, the Pops finished their song and left the stage for intermission.  Then the concert coordinators began showing the DNC on C-Span over the large screens.  They then finished up at 11:00 with 2 more songs with John Williams and the Boston Pops.  I felt like I was being brain-washed.  The concert planners had intentionally delayed the concert by 1 1/2 hours so that they could make sure everyone was there for the speech at 10:00PM.  Though there is a lot of liberal thinking in Boston, I am excited about what has already been accomplished here.  Of course there has been all of the typical moving stuff like address changes, bank account changes, etc.  But there has also been a lot of ministry that has been done.  Primarily TJ and I have accomplished a lot of planning and strategizing for the Fall semester.  We have someone working on our  urlLink website .  We ordered business cards.  We are having some pens made.  We planned our calendar of events and determined our weekly programs.  We have been praying and meeting together and realizing that there is a lot to do.   The biggest task right now is to find ways to meet students.  It is a lot different from the South where I am from.  There is a lot more difficulty in simply striking up a conversation with someone.  I actually scared one person when I asked them if they were a student.  There are a lot of difficulties, but there is no doubt that God is getting ready to do some great things in Boston.
