      Yes, mammo's are uncomfortable,sometimes downright painful for some women.  The questions we ask when filling out medical history forms are to determine breast cancer risks, not to be nosy.  And, yes, we do this all day long.  Some of us actually enjoy our jobs.  There are worse jobs to be had.  As for patient appointments,  please show up fifteen minutes early.  The appointment time is the time the mammographer is suppose to take the patient in for the exam, not the time for paperwork.  There will always be something to sign.(even if you had something done the day before)  Please bring I.D. and insurance cards, you wouldn't believe how many patients don't.  Please don't tell us how to do our jobs.  Be nice to your mammographers.  Why would anybody want to tick us off?  We control how much compression is used.  Keep answers to the questionnaire short and to the point.  PLEASE BATHE THE NIGHT BEFORE OR THE MORNING OF THE APPOINTMENT. Perfume does NOT cover up the smell of smoke or funk, it makes it worse.  We can't tell our patients anything about the images, we're not doctors, so don't ask.

      Why can't patients show up early for their appointments?  I have patients scheduled every 15 minutes.  Today my 8:00 arrives at 8:00. By the time I get her paperwork it's 8:11 which leaves me 4 minutes to do the questionnaire and exam in time to get the 8:15 back.  Needless to say, I didn't get the 8:15 back until 8:23 and the 8:30 back at 8:35.  This is my #1 pet peeve.  Ladies, please have more respect for others.  When you show up late for an appointment you're taking up other patients allotted time.   Please show up at least 15 minutes early.  There will always be paperwork to do, even if you had something done the day before.

      Ladies, please wear a two piece outfit when going for a mammogram.  I have my patients change into a mammo cape for the exam.  These mammo capes are truly one size fits all.  I've had some pretty large women and they cover everything.  When a patients wears a one piece outfit I have them change into a gown.  Are any of you familiar with hospital gowns?  They don't cover much.  Another pet peeve of mine is when a patient changes in front of me.  I know I'm going to see her breasts anyway, I just prefer that they not strip in front of me.
