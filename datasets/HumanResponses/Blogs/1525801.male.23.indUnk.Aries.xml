       Decisions, decisions...   we're faced with lots of decisions everyday, every moment in our lives... but why does it sometimes seem too difficult to make them? why are some decisions simple and why are some complicated?   "don't know what to do whenever you are near, don't know what to say..."

       whoa! what a dream!   had one of the strangest dreams last night... i was watching some kind of variety program in school and there was this dance number performed by some friends of mine. they did splits, cartwheels, sommersaults ( tama ba spelling? ), and other acrobatic moves. the thing is... these people don't usually dance, and if they do, its the usual body swaying/shaking dance... damn... what a dream!

      last week thursday, a good friend and i got to talk. it was  11pm , i came from my masters and fetched my friend from work. talked mainly about one thing,  RELATIONSHIPS .  i told her about how i feel about another  good friend  (a mutual friend)... this friend was one of the special people among my friends. its like she's almost always been there for me, we used to go out once in a while, just the two of us. her parents trust me 'cause they know i'm a  good guy . i like her, i really do... i'm just afraid to love her.  i'm afraid that things would change if i would tell her how i feel... i'm excited by the  "what-ifs" , but i'm terrified of the  "what-if-nots" . what do i really feel for her? it scares me... though it also makes me feel happy.

       of disappointments...   life is like a wheel... sometimes you're on top, sometimes you're at the bottom. sometimes everything goes you're way, sometimes everyone seems to be against you.  i was supposed to meet up with someone for lunch today... it was planned since last week 'cause the we were also supposed to meet up then but then was cancelled. so we re-set the meeting for today... and lo and behold, something came up again. sometimes i think some things aren't just meant to happen. oh well...   on a lighter note...   i've started reading the book a friend introduced to me, " The Purpose Driven Life " by Rick Warren... its kinda like a 40-day companion/guide on how to find what life's all about.  another light note, and this is a really good thing... a friend's brother's daughter was born earlier today. congrats to the happy parents!  oh yeah, and i saw Mars last night... nothing much to see if you don't have a high-powered telescope. oh well... next time. =p

       She  May be the face I can't forget  The trace of pleasure or regret  May be my treasure or the price I have to pay  She  May be the song that summer sings  May be the chill that autumn brings  May be a hundred different things  Within the measure of a day  She  May be the beauty or the beast  May be the famine or the feast  May turn each day into a heaven or a hell  She may be the mirror of my dreams  The smile reflected in a stream  She may not be what she may seem  Inside her shell

       It scares the hell out of me…   Ok here’s the thing, she’s immature but definitely not stupid, she’s one of the smartest people I know… and it scares me, it scares me that she might notice how I feel for her… it scares me the she might not know how to handle my feelings toward her, that she might turn and walk away without even a sound.  Do I talk to her and tell her how I really feel?  How do I tell her how the very thought of her sends shivers down my spine, that the thought of her plants a smile in my face, that I could not imagine life without her, that I count every minute until the next time we see each other?  How do I tell her that it’s ok for me to wait, that I don’t care if she’s not ready yet, that daily phone calls or SMS messages are not necessary?  Does anyone else read my blog?  Does she read my blog? If she does, please tell me.

      it was nice seeing  her  again yesterday... she seemed so radiant despite  her  bad day... she walked out on some people who she couldn't get a handle of... how i wished i could've been there to show support for  her ...  meanwhile, we're having another family crisis... not my nuclear family but it concerns our whole clan... my aunt's court case unfortunately didn't go her way and so she's facing a civil lawsuit... how i wish i could help... but what could i do? i don't have the means to help...

       My Big Boss Step Dad    i had a very weird dream last night... i was the stepson of a mobster... we lived in a mansion that seemed like a maze of rooms, the doors lead to anywhere... one door lead to my stepsister's bathroom... and man was she hot... like totally  HOT ! she looked like the actress who plays Huntress in Birds of Prey.  she was constantly being chaperoned by 2 big bouncer-like bodyguards and drove around in a big black SUV... me, i was free to roam the streets on my own, usually with some friends. i didn't seem to acknowledge being the stepson of a mobster and lived an ordinary life (and nobody knew that i was indeed related to a mobster).  at night, my friends and i hung out in cafes... where we saw Natalie Portman and she was staring at me the whole time... a testament to my appeal... *hehehe*  weird no?

       i don't feel so good today...  again.  i think i'll develop something, either cough or colds...  that's what happens when you don't use your umbrella, instead you use a hoodless jacket...   different groups of my friends have different takes on what i should be doing... some say i should throw all caution away and go through with it, while some say, just wait it out and let time gradually help you...  bummer.  well, even if they have different suggestions, they all would have the same result (hopefully).  but for now, i've decided to stick it out a bit more... although i don't know how long i could hold myself back. we'll just have to see...

       i feel numb...  or dumb as the case may be...  what would happen if i'd run away and hide? stuck myself back in the rut i once was... would anybody care? i'd like to get away from it all... no more worries... where all my decisions would affect only myself...   i'm not selfish or anything, its just that with all that's been happening around and inside me, i feel so confused, frustrated... angsty. like i want to escape to a place where noone knows my name, they have no knowledge of my past... where i could make a fresh start...  dammit, the things running through my head at the age of 22!!!   i want to get away to a place where i could start a new me... or better yet a place to find who the real me is.

       nothing happened...  and its a good thing... i couldn't believe my ears when i heard her words... how could a person seem so mature in some ways be so childish? the mysteries of a woman... i didn't realize that underneath it all, she was an insecure, timid little creature that has such a short attention span... comparing a relationship to her favorite food!!!  flings can be compared to favorite foods but not serious relationships!!! truly loving relationships are like food staples on the dinner table... they are always there sometimes we could do without them but still we go back to them... we may not realize that we need them that much until we have nothing to eat...  truly-madly-deeply loving relationships can be compared to your  BED ... sure sometimes we could do with our  LAZYBOY  or we could get to sleep in the best bed in a hotel suite... but it still doesn't compare to our very own bed... we miss our bed even if its not the biggest, softest bed in the world but there's something about our bed that keeps us warm, comfy and secure... just like a truly-madly-deeply loving relationship.

       ho-hum...   our Tagaytay trip this weekend was cancelled... total bummer. oh well, at least i would still get to hang out with my friends... ah yes, the same group i've hung out with since college. they've always been there for me. i love them all.  this time hopefully my  good friend  ( see Jul 28 post ) would be there. should i tell her or not? shall i finally admit to her how i feel for her? its been obvious to almost everybody we know (including her dad), however it doesn't seem obvious to her... bummer. should i make my move tonight? dammit... i feel like a school boy with a crush...  oh well, i'll tell you later what happens... promise.

       hmmm...   met up with someone today (actually yesterday)... i saw her profile almost 2 weeks ago over the net and i just thought i'd give it a try and send her a message... after that we would talk on the phone... she'd call me up, sing for me...  she has such an angelic voice...   anywayz, back to the topic of our meeting today... why did i decide to meet up with her, well... she had a problem and i wanted to help... basically, that's it. and i wanted to confirm if she was really the one i saw in her profile ( some people put others' pictures on their profiles )... well, it turned out, it really was her. she looked real nice too... as in really nice... very much like a model.  i hope we could get to hang out some more.

       Running Over Roadkill    12:45am.   As the title suggests, I ran over roadkill.  It was already dead when I ran over it so why should it bother me.  It happened just a while ago on my way home, passing through the East Service Road, it was dark, there were no lights on the street (or if there were, they’re already busted).  It was a dog, or at least it looked like one with its head flattened and guts splattered along the street.  It was white, or at least I think it was, being covered in blood and all.  So why does this bother me?  Think of all the strays we have in the Philippines, chances are most of them would end up like the dead dog I ran over; or they might end up a delicacy in the tables of some diners, by the way, eating dogs are illegal and punishable by imprisonment.  Chances are they also might just die of old age after siring even more strays during their lifetime.    We can see strays almost everywhere, from the inner depths of the squatters’ areas to the streets of some of the more elite villages to the busy streets of the metro.  Strays would be there, walking around, minding their own business and sometimes, doing their business, if you know what I mean.  But the question is… does anyone really care?  Well, some people do, take for example the Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), they take in stray animals, provide food and shelter and look for potential housing for these animals.  However, most of us don’t even like to think about it.  Some say they have more pressing issues to attend to.  They say issues like poverty, graft and corruption, politics, etc. are more important to discuss rather than addressing the welfare of animals.  Let’s put it in this perspective, in the Bible, Jesus said “whatever you do to the least of your brothers, you do unto Me.”  We are all brethren in this world, humans and animals alike, we share the same spaces in this planet we live in, the conditions of our animal friends also reflect the way we live.  If we take animals for granted, it may suggest that we would take other people for granted.  Some might argue that we should address human concerns first before we work on the situation of the animals, I agree with that but can’t we also try to improve animal welfare while improving the welfare of other people?  Animals have less needs than people do so it can be argued that it is cheaper to take care of a dog than have another child.  Improving people’s lives should be hand-in-hand with improving animals’ welfare, which is why I commend PAWS on what they do and I do hope there would be more organizations like PAWS here in the Philippines.  And I do hope I don’t run over any stray animals in the near future.

       WIFI, Tagaytay and other stuff...   last night, my cousins and i played some badminton... this time my arms didn't ache as much after playing... it can only mean one thing... i'm improving ( or at least, i hope i am ).  today in one of my e-groups, we discussed stuff ranging from Bluetooth, WIFI, the latests mobile phone models and our pending trip to Tagaytay. its been quite a while since that group had any activity (messages posted), everybody's been busy for some time now. its nice to hear from them again... i miss them. really.

       'whatcha gonna do... 'whatcha gonna do when we come for you..,   got the chance to watch  Bad Boys 2  last night. it was a special showing project of DLSU-CSB. the movie was nice, action-packed and hilarious at the same time. Martin Lawrence was really, really funny!  i also saw Nica last night. a little background, Nica was a contender in the 2nd season of the Single show in ABC-5. she's a commercial model/event manager. she's been seen in Globe ads and the Gilbey's Island Punch commercials. from the looks of it, she was all alone last night, she had no date.  but as fate would have it  na-torpe na naman ako ... i didn't have the courage even to say "hi". dammit.  oh well, when will i ever get over this shyness?

       paper...   i miss  paper . i miss using pulp to write drafts for school papers and what-nots... i miss the feel of pen gliding on a thin layer of sheet paper, the sound it makes with every stroke. up and down, round and round. right now i'd just have to contend with the noise of every key-stroke, every mouse-click... straining my eyes on a display on a machine that silently and slowly kills me with the hint of radiation it gives off.  i wish we had more  paper ... the monetary kind. they say money cannot answer everything... but it sure does give lots of clues. you can't buy happiness with money... but it makes the ride more comfortable, sitting in the lap of luxury. this may sound greedy and shallow, and it is,  but don't you think the world would be better off if the big people would share their wealth with us little ones?   now about my subject... why " paper "? well, its coz i have a paper due in a few days and  i haven't started it yet!!!

       happy...   most things do turn out ok... at least up til now. i feel great that i got to play badminton again after 2 weeks of absence, won a game, lost a game but still it was a good day.  overall, it was a good weekend... also got to hang out with my friends last Saturday til the wee hours of Sunday morning. had loads of alcohol in my system. it was also nice to have let off some steam that's been building up inside me. just letting it out gave me relief however it has also raised a few concerns... some more trivial than others.  an issue was raised regarding the one that got away... i don't know if  she  heard it but my reply was:  for me, its not the question of if she got away or not... its if she only knew...  but i have a feeling that she does know.  the question now is...  what's next?    i wanna make you smile whenever you're sad... carry you around when your arthritis is bad.

       slow "hump" day   its been a slow Wednesday ( hump day )... nothing really happened today... didn't really got to go out... it was still raining.  tried to do some "take-home" work from school... its easy, just time consuming... although i still have too much time in my hands.  time... what everyone who's anyone is desperately trying to have more of... time to sleep, time to read, time to have fun, time work,  time to be with the ones they love ... time... its so fleeting, like a comet passing by the evening sky, like a rainbow after the storm has passed... they are all gone too soon.  i never imagined it being like this... i thought that after i finished my collegiate education, i'd be so busy and preoccupied with work and earning my living... i thought i'd be working for a multinational firm, telling people what to do without them knowing what's good for them. but alas my dreams of world domination have been put on hold. things haven't gone the way i've planned them to be. i guess the  Higher-Up  didn't want me to take over the world just yet.   well, there's still the future. i do hope the future would be relatively better than the present 'coz right now,  life sucks...

       when it rains...   it pours. most things come in droves when they arrive... sometimes it may seem over but then, it goes for another hurrah... just like in RN Elliot's Five Wave Principle.  here is the figure:  urlLink  Basic Pattern of Five Waves Principle   the next sections were lifted from:  urlLink  The Golden Section and Waves Principle     The Waves of (1), (3) and (5) in Fig.1 actually effect the directional movement. The Waves of (2) and (4) are countertrend interruptions. The two interruptions are apparently a requisite for overall directional movement to occur.  Elliott noted three consistent aspects of the fife-wave form. They are: the Wave 2 never moves beyond the start of the Wave 1, the Wave 3 is never the shortest Wave, and the Wave 4 never enters the price territory of the Wave 1.  Fig. 2 shows the first two Waves of Fig. 1 in greater detail. Notice the difference in their subdivisions, which reflect the two modes of the Wave development: motive and corrective. The two modes are fundamentally different in both their role and construction.  The motive Wave (also called the "five" one) has a five-wave structure. Its sub-waves are denoted by numbers (in this case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Both the five-wave pattern of Fig. 1 and its same-directional components, i.e. the Waves of (1), (3) and (5), employ motive mode. Their structures are called the "motive" structures because they powerfully impel the market.    -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-   another note, i bought a book yesterday but it wasn't for me... its for a certain  friend ... the book is entitled  The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic    by Sophie Kinsella... i hope she'll like it.

       just a thought...   its halloween tomorrow and i still don't have any idea what i'll be appearing as. last year i told my lil' cousin i was the invisible man that's why she didn't see me. this year i have no excuse for not being there.  this blog is turning out to be a lyrics page... been posting songs for the past few weeks... =p here's another one.    Guess I'm Falling 4 U  - Michael Buble -  When I look into your eyes I see sunshine The coulds are blown away I hope you're here to stay 'Cause I've got me needing more of you Guess I'm falling for you  You walk away My eyes caress you Then you turn and smile You've caught me thinkin' of love with you Guess I'm falling, I may be falling for you  Since I met you days are brighter Life's uneven loads are lighter When I hear you whisper the words I long to hear dear Now I look into your eyes I'm lost in knowing that you are all I want  My need for you is growing Guess I'm falling, I think I'm falling for you Think about falling for me too

       12.28am   just came home from karaoke night with some of my classmates and this was one of the songs i discovered... hope you like it too... =)    Maybe You Should Know   - Kenny Rogers -   Seems to me that we've been friends forever We spend our time together as all good friends will do  But the silence only lies If you could read my eyes They hold another feeling I could show you  Maybe you should know Just how much I love you  In my heart there's no one else above you  Maybe I should hope You find out for yourself somehow Or maybe I should tell you now Maybe I should wait and take the chances  A good dancer never dances Until he hears the cue But the orchestra is gone They've left us all alone There's no one here to tell me how to tell you  Maybe you should know Just how much I love you In my heart there's no one else above you Maybe I should hope You find out for yourself somehow Or maybe I should tell you  Maybe I should tell you Maybe I should tell you now

       what a blast!!!   last night  ROCK'D !!! went to a friend's party last night at her house... the food was good... the booze was overflowing... everyone enjoyed. kudos to  Mr. Cuervo and Saint Miguel ... =p  also got to see 2 of my former classmates who i haven't seen in at least 3 yrs, even if one of them had to leave early coz she had a curfew... 9pm...  A CURFEW FOR A 22 YEAR OLD !!! that's amazing/amusing...  anywayz, it was around 1.30am when the booze started having effects on me, and by 3pm i have successfully made one of my close friends cry...  what a jerk i was ... i spent the next hour trying calm her down, talking to her, telling her what a great person she is and that  those guys  don't deserve her that's why they didn't end up together... mind you, she is a  great person .   here's to the nights we felt alive here's to the tears you knew you'd cry here's to goodbye tomorrow's gonna come too soon...

       whatthe?   just came home from school...  as usual...  we had the dreaded exam today ( see previous post )... it felt like i " overstudied " for it coz we had to read piles upon piles of notes and a few slides... finding out later that the test was 10 items of multiple choice, 4 essay questions (answer only 2), and a case study (2 questions).  damn... i don't feel too good... i'm confident about the multiple choice and essay questions but had absolutely no answers for the case study.  will i fail the exam?  let's wait and see...

       whooo...   what a day!!! just came home from playing badminton with my cousins... it was great as usual, but there was a downside to it... my hamstring/knee injury acted up again so i only got to play a couple of games.  *damn*   another not-so-good thing happened today, i got a wound on my foot and it bled for a few minutes without me knowing it... funny how we don't feel pain until we see the wound. =p  come to think of it, its been 2 straight weeks that i played with an injury... last week i injured my finger thru my very own stupidity... it was a nail-clipping accident.  oh well... looking forward to monday...  NOT!!!

       what if?   one day... just one day, i could throw all caution to the wind? let everything just pass by... what if instead of being  Roydon Padua , i could have been someone else? what if i wasn't who i am? what if i changed the way i've been deciding through these years?  what if i was  bad ? what if i was not this goody-goody guy i've become? would i be in the same situation i am right now?  would the world have been the same if Roydon Padua was not born on that fateful day in March 1981?   would i be missed?

       tutor...   spent my afternoon in tutoring my classmates for our upcoming test on tuesday... it was supposed to be a study group but then i figured it would be better if i led the group. so that's how it feels to be in charge of a class... kinda fulfilling, kinda frustrating... overall, it felt great.  --   do we need to be flirts to win another's affections?  --> thinking out loud.

       crossing the line...   uncertainty brings out the best and the worst in people... crossing the line and diving into the uncertain is a terrifying thing to do.  i'm terrified...  i don't know what to do or what'll happen next.  i could say that i'm usually a risk averse person but in times when the future of something we've built up all these years is concerned... its a totally different situation altogether.  dammit... i don't know... but whatever happens, i'll always be here... hopefully.

       realization:   there are only 3 people i've revealed my feelings to. (1) my 1st crush... she avoided me all throughout elementary and the first few years of high school... we became a couple during college but didn't last long... she played my feelings. (2) my college crush... she avoided me during the first few years of college... she was then courted by my other friend, i let him. (3)  her ... and i don't know what'll happen next coz she's a very good friend.   traumatic ain't it?

        I Love You  - Sarah McLachlan  I have a smile Stretched from ear to ear To see you walking down the road  We meet at the lights I stare for a while The world around disappears  Just you and me On this island of hope A breath between us could be miles  Let me surround you My sea to your shore Let me be the calm you seek  Oh and every time I'm close to you There's too much I can't say And you just walk away  And I forgot To tell you I love you And the night's Too long And cold here Without you I grieve in my condition For I cannot find the strength to say I need you so  Oh and every time I'm close to you There's too much I can't say And you just walk away  And I forgot To tell you I love you And the night's Too long And cold here Without you

       "If you love somebody, you say it out loud, then and there... or the moment shall pass you by..." -  Michael, My Best Friend's Wedding      "I love that you get cold when it's 80 degrees outside.  I love the way you get that little crinkle in your forehead when you're looking at me like I'm crazy.  I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes.  I love that that you are the first thing I think of when I get up in the morning, and you're the last person I want to talk to before I go to bed at night.  I came here because when you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."  "When Harry Met Sally"

       To Her…   I’m sorry for causing you much undue pressure or burdening you with such an issue as this, but it can’t be helped in one way or another you would have found out. Either from our friends, from other people or from me… I decided on the latter. In my opinion, it would have been better if it came directly from me but now the question became when the right time was to tell you how I felt.  I’ve been pondering on this thought for quite some time now,  putting myself under my own manipulation and control .  Sometimes it came to a point that  I was about to tell you but I didn’t … why I have no idea.  I confessed my feelings for you today,  I told you I liked you . Why? Well because on my way to your home, it hit me… There is no point in waiting for the right time if the person I would tell isn’t there anymore. I’d hate what usually happens in movies like when someone dies, someone usually has a line that goes, “if only…” I do not want that to happen.  The right time for me is right now .  I do not expect anything grand in return, all I ask is for you to let me know what’s on your mind…

        What Everybody Knows  - Marc Dorsey  I know you're wondering  What this is all about  Candles and champagne  dinner is all made out   I wanted this night  to be perfect for you  It's gotta be right  for what i'm gonna do  So baby sit down  and open youre heart to me   CHORUS:  Girl, it's time you know  What everybody knows  To say the words I feel  To tell you what is real  and let my feeling shows  The whole world knows it's true  I'm so in love with you...  Baby look at me  and in my eyes you'll see  What everybody knows   It seems like a lifetime  Girl since i met you (oh baby..)  And from that first moment  Deep in my heart I knew  That someday I'll be  where I'm standing today  Touching your body  kissing your face  Holding the dreams  that's finally coming true   Baby look at me  And in my eyes you'll see  What everybody knows...

       what a lovely life...   its kinda ironic that a few weeks ago i said life sucks... well, here i am now refuting myself. i wasn't able to see how the greater picture would work out. i'm happy, my friends are happy... well most of them are, but still i do believe that in the end, everything would turn out great.  i can't help it, deep down inside, i'm still the romantic idealist that i was a few eons ago...   its 1 am, october 1, 2003... i just came home from class, then dinner, then coffee with my classmates... it wasn't the usual dinner after class thing we do every tuesdays and thursdays... this time we had to give our support to one of our  berks  (barkada = friend)... he had a problem with his significant other's family and we gladly offered our support to him... i hope and pray everything would turn out right...  oh well, change topic... guess what? the paper i was referring to in my previous post... i finished it... well, somewhat finished it. i couldn't really find any sources of info so i had to make do with what i had. i ended up with a two-page paper discussing the most obvious factors that affect our business.  'nuff said.  hope that would already suffice for a decent grade.  i've also been drawn to  urlLink friendster ... its surprising that there are 82,000++ people in my network.  i'm famous!!!

       angsty moment:  Keeping Dreams In The Dreamworld...     The world is a vampire, sent to drain  Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames  And what do I get, for my pain?  Betrayed desires, and a piece of the game   Even though I know--I suppose I'll show  All my cool and cold-like old job   Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage  Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage  Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved  Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage   - "Bullet With Butterfly Wings", Smashing Pumpkins    we seldom realize it but living in the real world robs us of what we really want--what we used to wish for, our ambition when we were young. in my case, i wanted to be a doctor... i wanted to cure the sick, i wanted to help the needy, etc.   this all changed when i realized that i didn't have the will to become a doctor, i didn't want to study the same subject matter for God knows how many years, then take up internship, residency, etc. i didn't have the capacity to face my patients when they are suffering incurable diseases... nowadays i don't even want to be in a hospital.  back in college, i took up a business course, did my best in academics, reached the dean's list twice during my tenure, and eventually, i graduated on time. i was 19 when i graduated. i had planned on taking a few weeks off for vacation and then start to look for work, preferably in a managament/business consultancy firm... i thought i was good at telling people what to do, doing it right meant doing it my way. this was not to hold true in the real life, sure i took a few weeks off but then i struggled to find work, nobody wanted an inexperienced 19 year old to take a position that demanded a lot of responsibility.   i ended up finding a job 6 months after graduation but it was nothing like what i wanted. i worked for a bank, in the operations department, the official title was  "Junior Accounts Assistant" , i was tasked to assist the accounts officer in handling the transactions of clients among other things... in other words, i was a  liason  officer ( layas dito, layas doon ). another term coined by my mentor was that i became a corporate  gopher  ( go-for-this, go-for-that ). my day started by taking a visit to my boss' filing cabinet, sifting thru the documents needed for the day's transactions and then liasing with the different divisions of the bank...  by lunchtime, i had journeyed thru most of the building.  lunchbreak was often compromised to give in to the clients' whims. i couldn't take any more of it... i left after 1 and a half months.  my next job was a sales job...  i wasn't even good at speaking in front of people before i took the sales job.  so i took all the necessary seminars to improve my "skills" and improve i did, however, my sales performance didn't move a wink from zero. i was spending more than what i earned in sales and then i decided to leave.  so i enrolled myself in a master's degree program to improve my "marketability" in the corporate world, and so i am here now, suffering in the reality that school life is. but before classes started, i took up photography, i wanted to  explore  my creative side... it was a worthwhile experience, and i decided a career professional photography would be my next goal. i am hoping the real world wouldn't shatter my dream this time...  in my previous post, i said i wanted to fly... but given the situation in the real world, it may take some time before i do fly away and rise above it all, or if worse comes to worst, i may be stuck here, grounded for all of eternity.  ====   build up what you are... reinforce who you are... live to achieve you dream... and die anyway.

       angsty moment:  pushing myself away...     i want to get away... i want to fly away...  as the song went... but to where? do i really have the means? am i really prepared to run away?  if indeed i ran away... what next?  change?  maybe?  everything seems to be pushing away from me... people i need close to me seem to be growing away from me...   I HATE CHRISTMAS!!!  people are too busy for their own good. can't we all just stop and talk a while?  ====    Don’t Push Me Out, You’ll Hurt Me  (But It Is The True Me)   Don’t push me out again, For I may not return, Don’t push me out again, It still makes me hurt.  I may not be back For you have shut me out I have never been so down Since you pushed me out.  I have been in love With someone like you Fallen in vain Fell, shame, pain.  Don’t push me out again For I may not be the same person You pushed out from your life I may not be half the man.  Half the man I was Half of what should have been Less than what was Or maybe someone free.  Over the rainbow, Over the sea, I found someone else in my place, Someone else not me.  Someone who has been hiding Deep within. Someone who could not be  The someone you never knew.  One tiny instance I looked to see I saw a figure who looked like me. He or it I couldn’t make of It was horrible but radiant still.  It was me, I think, I feel Less or more I wish I knew But this for sure, though not pure, It was a figure of me.  Don’t push me out again, You might hurt me, Delicate, subtle, feeble me You might hurt the one you once loved.  I don’t mean to hurt you, But this is me You pushed me out, Couldn’t you see.  I have returned not as me But as someone I hid inside Someone I tried to hide, It is the true me…    (1999)   ====   when i die, who would remember?   ====   the next time you turn around to look, i may not be there...

       another weird dream:  The Truth About Man's Initiative    this morning, i woke up from another weird dream... in it, we were having a sort of homecoming at school. strangely enough, the setting was at my  old elementary school but the guest of honor was our assistant principal from my high school ... let's hide him by the name  Mr. D .  a little background on Mr. D... he was avery strict, straight-forward guy... drove around in his Beige VW Beetle and always had pomade on his hair. anyway, as he was speaking, i was doing a little chit-chat with  her  at the back row. the conversation went like...   Her:  guess where i've been the whole weekend?  Me:  um... everywhere?  Her:  uh-huh...  SALE, SALE, SALE!!!  (shouting)  and so naturally everybody looked to see who that was shouting in the back row while the guest of honor was doing his speech.   Mr. D.:  who shouted? is that you Ms. ___?  Her:  yes, sir...  Mr. D.:  well then, this demands a reprimand for you... i expected more of you.  i abruptly interrupted...   Me:  but sir, it was not her fault... i said something that's why she shouted...  Mr. D.:  well Mr. Padua, could you and Ms. ___ come see me after my speech...  so Mr. D,  her  and i talked privately... he gave me a lecture on  The Truth About Man's Initiative ... he based his lecture on a poem someone wrote and it went...   what for do birds chirp in the morning than to brighten up the day? what for does the air exist than to let man enjoy his life?   and then in ending, he asked me... " So Mr. Padua, this I ask you... what for is your initiative for standing up for Ms. ___? " i couldn't answer... not with  her  standing in the same room even though  she  knows how i feel...  last resort... i woke myself up.

       * ehem, ehem *     Drowning in Your Eyes  - Ephraim Lewis -  Feel the ground it's slipping away Like a sigh that greets the close of day Feel the water's welcoming arms Embrace me in their quiet karma I can't hear what you say anymore Just the sound of trees on the ocean floor Irresistibly drawn from the shore   I'm drowning in your eyes I'm floating out to sea Helpless on the restless tide That flows between you and me   Moving slowly as if in a dream The colours change from blue to green All around me reflections of you  In forests deep I'm passing through In the swell of the storm we're as one We're dancing in the morning sun Could it be that we've only just begun  Lying here beside you I try to reach you but you're so far...   another set of lyrics in this pseudo-lyric page/blog of mine...

       the evil known as DANSKA   afternoon of November 15, 2003... i accompanied my friends going on a house-to-house distribution of invites for our upcoming batch reunion... it was great to see how our old schoolmates, who we haven't seen in years, changed  or remained the same ... some of them just looked older... wiser? maybe...  then we had dinner in a  cafe  near our place and then proceeded with our organizers' meeting... man, planning a reunion is exciting!!!  after a while, my cousin called me up, reminding me of the party they're having at his place ( which was near the cafe we were at )... he told me to bring over my friends coz the party was dead... so we went there, all  8  of us. and there it happened... there we encountered the  EVIL  known as  DANSKA ... its an authentic German Vodka with 40% alcohol volume. we took turns shooting that damned thing... didn't even get to finish the  bottle/canister . i got drunk waaay before midnight and was noisy as usual... laughing out loud, shouting at everyone i see... some things i don't recall about last night and the things i remembered, they're all cloudy.   went home around  1am  (relatively early), didn't even wait for my brother to come over.  when i got home, talked to one of my friends, " freshened " up and went straight to bed... felt sooooooo heavy, didn't even notice i was already asleep.  =p   ====   everything's so blurry, everyone's so fake... everybody's empty and everything is so messed up...

       blind strokes of genius   changed my subtitle today.  why, you ask? well, just felt like it.  its been a dreadful day... had to make-up a class earlier, was an hour late for it. i left for school early,  like an hour and a half before the class starts . waded thru traffic, passed  two accidents  on my way to school. that was why i was an hour late for class. traffic was so bad that i took some pictures on the way.  got to class, the lecture hadn't really gone that far from where we last left off but then i suddenly felt the urge not to listen to my prof. so i did everything, as in  EVERYTHING , i could do with my laptop... played games, changed the wallpaper, etc. but still, i had two hours left before dismissal. so what did i do?  rather than taking down notes from the lecture, i decided to write my own notes, not necessarily related to our topics, but they were my notes on what i felt that time and the things happening around me. and guess what, i used up three pages in MS-Word for the next two hours of writing.  haven't written nonsense that long for quite some time now. as usual, i was ranting, raving... rambling about anything and everything. just anything that crossed my mind, i would write... it felt good... it felt healthy to just sit down and write.  then at last, the class was over. i had dinner with a few of my classmates, talked, and just went straight home. i was tired. on the way home, i also passed  two accidents  on the road. one between a truck and a car, the other was three cars that lost control and swerved to the curb and the median.  oh well, as a consequence for not paying attention to the lecture earlier,  i didn't learn a thing today ... and that my friends is a   blind stroke of genius  .  ====    A:  Knock, knock?  B:  Who's there?  A:  "Open the sky"  B:  "Open the sky" who?   A:  Look!!! "OPEN THE SKY"!!! It's a bird!!! *corny* =p

       Halloween, All Saints' Day, All Souls' Day 2003    Oct 31   got up relatively early coz we had to go to my cousins' place in Alabang... we had a sort of reunion and we went trick or treating.. well, at least they did, i just drove... got there around 2pm, my cousin (Brian) was fixing up his costume for the night, he was going to be Dexter (from Dexter's Lab)... he went through all the fuss of buying a lab gown, rubber gloves, an orange-haired wig, and a self-made wrench (made of cardboard and painted silver).  took some pictures of the babies in our clan... one went as a pirate, another was Supergirl and then the other was Batman... gave me the idea to come as the Justice League next year.   me i just wore a tall, chequered hat...  =p  did i mention there was also a reunion thingy??? well... as usual, the food was GREAT!!! must've gained 5 lbs that day.  around 10.30pm, we headed for the cemetery to visit our dead... as usual there were tons of people there... i also saw a minimum of 5 hotdog stands there, all of them Purefoods.  =p  we stayed there only a few minutes coz we didn't see the point of staying there the whole night... we just prayed and then payed our respects, then left.   Nov 1   since we already went to the cemetery the night before, i was free the whole day... we played badminton in the afternoon somewhere in Makati (Powersmash)... the court was nice but we only stayed there for 2 hrs since it was really full... we transferred to Fit2Play, Makati... some of us got bored and left early since we've already had our fair share of play time in Powersmash.   Nov 2   went to our province (Indang, Cavite)... yet another reunion, this time the whole Romerosa-Angeles clan was there (well, most of us)... it's a 2++ hr drive from where we live... good thing i just rode shotgun.  =p  again, the food was again GREAT!!!  we got home around 5.20pm and then scurried to the badminton court since we had a 6pm reservation. got to play 4 games today (2-2)... it was great but then i kinda sprained my ankle... its not sore now since i iced it after playing, but maybe tomorrow i'd be feeling the pain.  oh well, i guess that's all for now... my weekend's been characterized with eating a lot and trying to lose the weight i gained... plus, i think i'm becoming a badminton addict...  =p

       'Tis the Season...    Christmas Day is almost over ... it was fun! We've been partying since Friday last week... but it was just today that I really felt Christmas... it was today that we had our annual family Christmas party. For the first time in 7 years, we were complete. Today I really got to hang out with my cousins... we sang songs, played games, danced...  it was fun!   =====   Counting Blessings  For Christmas... i got myself some new clothes... gave myself a new phone... received 2 bags... received some clothes and a cap... and some dough ( now I can pay off some bills =p ).  Its about this time of year, looking back after all the angst and grief, that I feel really fortunate to be blessed in such a way that life has been good to me overall. I love my family... I love my friends... and I'm very thankful to God that He has blessed me.  =)   =====   Something short of not-so-goodness...  After playing badminton for free today, my cousin received a call from their neighbor ( Bud ) in QC... Bud told my cousin that one of their other neighbors was robbed, some valuables were taken and that they had to go all the way there to check on their own house.  Damn professional theives ...  didn't even respect Christmas day ... they don't have the spirit of giving... all they know is the  spirit of taking .

       Bazaars, Booze, Salad and Coffee   went with my sister to two bazaars yesterday... the original plan was to first go to the mall and then to the bazaars, well guess what happened?  TRAFFIC WAS AWFUL!!!  parking was a hassle (didn't even get to get in line for parking). there were just too many people in the malls over the weekend so we headed straight to our first bazaar destination. we went to  Shop @ The Fort  over at the NBC Tent, it was nice... there were a myriad of not-so-great finds there, a bit on the pricy side of bazaar retail.   next we headed to the  World Bazaar Festival  at the WTC over at Roxas Blvd, it was a whole lot better but parking was scarce. there were over 150 booths for items like shirts, pants, toys and other gift items... to sum it all up, it was  FUN !  last night, we also had a drinking session over at my cousin's place... we shared stories, drank fine mead (i.e. beer, Vodka Ice and Mule)... overall, it was  FUN !  earlier today my classmates and i had an adventure at  Tagaytay ... we arrived at  Sonia's Garden  around 10:30am, had lunch there and had a stroll to make all the food we ate go down. it was delicious! we took 40+ pics, some better than others... but overall, it was  FUN !  after lunch, we had coffee over at  Starbucks - Tagaytay ... the place was great, the view was exhilirating! it was  FUN !  on the way home, we passed a vehicular accident, a dump-truck ran over 2 cars (Miatas), one of which was completely smashed... now you ask,  why 2 Miatas?  answer: apparently they were part of the Miata Club driving their way home from a weekend drive-around. damn, ang  malas nila ! i do hope the drivers are ok... now that was not  FUN !  oh well, tomorrow's another work week... damn... i hate Mondays!  ====   why does this weekend have to come to an end?

       Hopeful...   just got home from school( Pasig ) earlier this evening...  plus dinner and coffee (in Makati) . the class was  boring !!! half-way through the session, i was already half-asleep and absent-minded.  =p   anywayz, as the title suggests, i am hopeful... hopefully some good things would happen in the next few days (or at least something significantly different from usual). hopefully some of my friends and i would get to go to  Sonia's Garden  in Tagaytay... its almost been a year since i was last there.  ====   hopeful... wishful... compromising... better than nothing? maybe.

       Compromising...   that's the story of my life... its all compromise, nothing's always what i wish it to be...  something's  always  missing . so to those that feel frustrated that it seems like nothing goes the way you wish it to be, just always keep in mind, there is still a  worse loser  than you will ever be... and that's  me .  i've been on the losing side of most bargains since God-knows-when... i'm used to it, to say the least.  indifference is a virtue .  so keep your head high, coz the things happening around you are way better than this rut i got myself in.  =)   ====    Where Are You Going?  - Dave Matthews Band  Where are you going, with your long face pulling down? Don’t hide away, like an ocean But you can’t see, but you can smell And the sound waves crash down  I am no superman I have no answers for you I am no hero, oh that’s for sure But I do know one thing for sure Is where you are, is where I belong  I do know, where you go, is where I want to be   Where are you going, where do you go? Are you looking for answers, to questions under the stars? If along the way you are growing weary,   you can rest with me until a brighter day  It’s okay, where are you going, where do you go?

       Operating at 60% Brain Capacity ( last night ROCK'D )!!!     Reunion   It was fun... well, for most of the time... it was fun right before guests started arriving. that's when the fun of planning stopped and the chaos of execution begun. The caterer was late... some of the organizer's were late too ( no offense meant ). Another reason why not everything went well was that we fell short of our target attendance. * damn * Plans were spoiled.   She  was late but that's ok... what disappointed me was the fact that we didn't really get to talk. My  ex  was there too, now her i got to speak with... it wasn't really a pretty sight, spent most of it exchanging half-meant " comments " with her.   Another not-so-good thing happened, some of the guests couldn't relieve themselves of the stigma that me and my ex aren't a couple and its been sooo long since we really saw each other. They couldn't believe that I had no more feelings for her... they're,  pardon the word ... stupid.    Afterparty   We had a Post-Reunion Afterparty at one of the guests' houses. It was  HUGE ! It had a bachelors-type basement where all the things a guy could ask for were... they had a nice stereo system, a pool table, a mini-fridge, and a liquor cabinet... *damn*  kakainggit .  We sang songs as ( as in anything off the top of our heads ) another guest strummed the guitar strings, shot my fave pal (  Jose Cuervo!!!  ), and wasted the night... err, morning away. Got home at around 5:30am... that's the second time in 3 days I got home past 5am.  This is becoming unhealthy .  ====   didn't play badminton today... too tired... =p   ====   we'll see... we'll see...

       wondering...   another weekend has passed... spent it mostly at home...  again.  had our final organizers' meeting for the upcoming batch reunion... but before that, i was faced with an urgent dilemma... it was saturday and i had nothing to do. i had a 2-hour lay-off just sitting at home, pacing around... wondering what went wrong (or  right ).  yesterday, we played badminton with my cousins...  again.  succumbed to back spasms after only two games... dammit. right now as i'm sitting in front of the computer, typing away my thoughts on the weekend, i'm left  wondering ...  when will the hurting stop?   ====   isn't it fascinating how two persons' blogs can look so similar and yet be altogether different?

       Too Early...   i got to school ( UA&P ) too early today, i came from my other school ( DLSU ) to meet up with a former prof of mine. when i got to LaSalle, i was greeted by a very unfamiliar sight... there were only a few students around!   DLSU has been known to be overcrowded at times but this time, it seemed almost like a ghosttown. there were no students inside the classrooms although there were some on the field. i then discovered that they were having  LEAP  week, its a whole week of alternative education classes for the students, they were having classes on hockey, arnis and street dancing among others. it was also a special day for the College of Business and Economics, they were having their graduation rites at the Yuchengco Center--a 10-storey building donated by the Yuchengco clan thus the name.   now this got me thinking ... what if i had taken my time with studying and "extended" my tenor at DLSU? would i have experienced these developments? but then again, if i had taken my time, would i be enjoying the life i'm having now?  ====   hmmm....

       Life's too short...   come to think of it, we are but a fleeting moment in the course of history... the real challenge is what to make of the short span of existence we are given.   last night i blew off class to go to Particia's wake ... its such a sad thought that we haven't seen each other in years and what brought us ( our other batchmates and me ) together was a passing of a friend. we even passed by her house to invite her for our reunion, though she wasn't there ( didn't even get the chance to talk to her ). she didn't get to attend the reunion too.  another sad thought was that the most painful thing to happen to a parent is when they lose their children.

       Rediscovery    nostalgia is only effective if you remember...   last night i finally got to attend the homecoming of our high school ( DB Makati )... after 7 years from graduation and 5 years of just being there, i finally got to go back.  Jao  and i arrived around 9pm at Busko,  grabe dami ng tao !!! it was the silver anniversary of batch 1979 and the golden anniversary of the school (1954)... too bad the food and the booze weren't free this time...  so we left around 10.30pm and went to Krocodile Grill in Greenbelt 3, ate dinner and had a few drinks and then transferred to  Kev 's condo ( walking distance from gbelt )... and get this,  we were all guys and we didn't get wasted on alcohol when we got there ... only had soda and chips, the nostalgia of the yesteryears kept us quite entertained... we talked about how it was back then, where our other classmates are, and our next get-together... damn... we had a great time... got home around  5am .  ====   and all the roads we have to walk are winding... and all the lights that light the way are blinding...  there are many things that i would like to say to you  but i don't know how ...

       Resurrecting    from the ashes a phoenix rises after 500 years of slumber...   wow! its been a while since i last blogged... oh well, no one reads it so i guess its ok not updating it like it should. anywayz, a lot's been happening,  and a lot i wished should've happened but didn't ...   got to watch the final installment of the  Lord of the Rings Trilogy  2 weeks ago with  Sam  my movie buddy ( no, not Samwise Gamgee ). it was opening day, we watched the first showing for the day... man that was some movie!!! can't wait to get a copy of the complete boxed set ( if and when it's gonna be available )...  was in  Bulacan  last weekend for aother friend's birthday celebration ( Rhine )... that was a blast too... got to drink  2 kinds of tequila , sang videoke and really just spend the night ( read: 24 straight hours ) with my most dearest friends ( read:  ^Angels^  ).   got home around 4.30pm on a sunday, immediately left to play  badminton , my cousin's were already waiting in the car when i arrived... that was one of the worst decisions i made for this month, by the fourth game i was playing like i was drunk... i couldn't hit the ball, vision was blurry and i couldn't move at all.  so  here i am now, just arrived from school ( well, we had a late dinner and coffee too )... had a heart-to-heart talk with my  berks  ( read: masteral classmates )... that was that, i won't disclose what we discussed but this i can truly admit...  it struck a chord .  ====   i am everything you want, i am everything you need... but i mean nothing to you and i don't know why...

       Forex... shmorex...   earlier today i attended an orientation of a company engaged in forex placements abroad. although we didn't discuss the technical side of forex trading, we were taught how to market ( aka. sell ) the " service " to potential clients. the idea was appealing but i'm having second thoughts about it... its still a bit murky... and i still can't get rid of the stigma of forex trading companies as  scams .  another reason the company didn't really convince me was the  trainor ... he didn't look his age ( he was 65 ), actually looked younger... he had a certain enthusiastic aura about him, a real salesman... now the downside,  all he cares about is his money ! he had no kids... and when one of us asked for reconsideration because no one would take care of her kids, he didn't offer any concrete solution.  please, please, please... to anybody reading this blog...  please remind me not to grow old, single, no kids and loves money above all else . if i do become that which i fear, by all means, please give me a slap on the wrist.  ====   got to review... need to review... argh!!!

       Singularity on Hearts Day   today is the much anticipated/commercialized Hearts Day, aka.  Valentine's Day . its supposed to be the most romantic day of the year when people, especially couples/lovers celebrate their love for each other. aren't they able to do that on any other day?  i mean,  love should be celebrated the whole year , right?   anywayz, here's what transpired today... of course being single, i had no dates planned so a few friends ( Rhine ,  Deb  and  Sam ) and i decided to go to  Tagaytay , just the four of us single people. we left around 10am to have lunch in Tagaytay... we arrived at  Viewsite  around 12.30pm, we had the buffet...  yum!  we also took some pictures there and then headed to  Caleruega .  for those who don't know yet, Caleruega is a church in Nasugbu, Batangas. its said to be one of the most ideal places to get married... the place was awesome!!! the view was great!!! it was indeed  romantic . there was a wedding that day, so we agreed to have a look-see ( criticize the bride, the groom and everything else )...  after Caleruega, we went to  Sonya's Garden , one of the most romantic places to date... we saw an abundance of couples holding hands while walking ( pa-sway-sway pa ).  too bad our other friends weren't able to join us...  tough luck, their loss !  now, back home... i have a date with the tv and a bunch of DVDs.  =p   ====    Road Sights  Aircon Radiator Wildeng Shop Restaurant and Convenient Store   ====    One Syllable Conversation  Customer: Bababa ba?

       Twisted Logic:  Make Love Not War!    in one of my e-groups, a buddy posted the phrase:  Make love not war ... and another's reply went like:    making love causes war... well, at least too much of it... it causes much growth to one country's population, straining their resources and a booming population needs space, something most countries have a lack of.   so. here's my side of the coin:   i would have to disagree... for diminishing resources of one country, there is such a thing as  TRADE  between countries, in my belief, there is no such thing as a self-sufficient country in this cruel world. now for the land issue, we don't need to go to war for that.   hmmm... i think i took that one too seriously...  ====  this is a very nice site i discovered just recently... you can post your opinions/how-to's  on just about anything.  urlLink How To: By You   ====   i did a 20 minute drive from Valle 1 to our place... ain't it grand?

       Them...   i cut class today to meet up with some friends for dinner. it was nice to see some of my college friends again ( Raymond ,  Patis , and  Fritz ), its been a few months since we saw each other. man, they all looked nice... i mean they all look " professional " in office attire and what-not. me, as always, i was in jeans and a shirt.  we just had dinner in  Sbarro  in Megamall, the food wasn't that good... it was a tad bland, and the chicken was a bit on the hard side ( and no, i'm not afraid of getting bird flu ). after dinner we went to Patis' place... its been quite a while since we last hung out at her house ( last time we were there doing our college thesis )... had to leave around 10.30pm to have coffee with my masteral classmates.  got to Starbucks, ordered the usual ( Vanilla Latte ), went to Mini Stop. we hung out there for a few minutes, talked about V-day, ghost stories, test scores ( i got a 77.57 on our midterms ), etc. we vacated Mini Stop around 11.45, on the way to Kinz's place she asked me something that struck a chord... and all i could answer was " no comment, saka na lang ako mag-press release. " and that's it... i would just release an official statement in a few days/weeks.  =p   ====   its one thing to say it... and its another to actually mean it...

Aunque No Me Digas - Evangeline Guerero -   Yo sé que me quieres aunque no me digas yo sé que me tienes cautiva por siempre en las fuertas redes de tu propia vida, celeste incensario de un sueño perenne.  Aunque no me digas que sin mí no vives, mi anhelo me dice que todo es verdad; que ciñen tu frente muchas flores tristes si agobiado piensas en un despertar.  Yo, que he de decirte? Te miro . . . y callo Tú ya bien comprendes mis hondos silencios. La estrella hecha flor del cielo lejano contempla en las aguas su sombra sin miendos.  Deja que mi pena repose en tu pecho, como fatigada paloma viajera. A la sombra tibia del tranquilo huerto de la paz gocemos la caricia buena.  Que sea el reposo canción, serenata, mientras hilavanamos en la hora serena los sueños maduros de épocas pasadas que llenan de efluvios muestras almas viejas.  Aunque no me digas que piensas en mí, que toda me guardas en tu corazón, volveré al recuerdo y hallándote a tí, aunque no me digas sabré que es amor!   ====   need help?  urlLink Click Here.    ====   What's Been Happening...

       It's a lonely lonely lonely lonely day...   woke up relatively early today, why? its my f**ing birthday. nothing special today, had to renew my driver's license and then go to school in the evening.  only a select few of my friends greeted me as of the moment, some unexpected greetings from people i haven't seen in a long time. to them, miss y'all!!!  i was at the  LTO Makati District Office  around 9.30am...  alone . it wasn't my first time renewing my DL there... last time it took only an hour to finish, but this time it took 2 hours... why? well, the computers there picked a very nice day to start hanging!!! =(  after that, i decided to treat myself to lunch at  Rockwell ...  alone . the Powerplant mall is said to be one of the best/most prestigious malls in the country, and guess where i had lunch?  Jollibee!!!   after lunch, watched a movie...  alone . i saw Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore's  50 First Dates ... it was a fun movie... hilarious would be an understatement.  then had coffee and apple pie at  Sugarhouse ...  alone . and right now i'm in an internet cafe in school... too early for my class which starts at 6pm.   *sigh*   ====   i'm just a curbside prophet with a hand in my pocket... waiting for my rocket to come.

       Blue...   just came home from a product launch of a new scent from  Ralph Lauren  called  Blue , held at the  DreamBar @ 6750 . its amazing how many socialites have the ability to converge in the middle of the work-week... the good thing was, there were so many pretty faces at the launch.  earlier today ( well yesterday ), i was planning to go to a former employer to do some research on their industry... this didn't materialize. what happened was i sped off to my former college to get more data for my paper.  dammit ... i'm getting swamped with all the numbers!!! some of us are planning to defer submission of the papers due tomorrow ( well today ).  ====   A new destination in Fragrance...

       Growing Old...   cut class earlier, it was the same old boring stuff so i decided that its much, much better to lend a helping hand to my cousin. he was planning to finally propose to his long-time girlfriend.  the plan was this, we'd be playing badminton and when there are only a few people left, he'd come out with a bouquet of flowers and sing Adam Sandler's   Grow Old With You  --which by the way is their theme song. this was the challenge for yours truly:  how do i smuggle my trusty 6-string into the court without the girl noticing?   i found my chance when the girl went inside the ladies' room so i sprinted out the court to my car ( more than 50 yards away ), got the guitar from the trunk, raced back to the court and put my guitar inside the court owner's office before she got out of the cr... fortunately we made it although i was short of breath after the ordeal. after a while, another cousin led the girl outside to "talk" about something while we prepared.  finally the girl returned to the court, my cousin and i emerged from the office... he had a big bouquet of flowers while i was strumming away... the girl said  YES --or at least we think she did... oh well, it was all caught on tape so we could review it later.  =p    Best Wishes  Reynold  and  Angel !!!   ====    Topet : Angel, handa ka na ba talaga na maging part ng pamilya namin?

       Bummed Out...   i totally bummed around during the weekend... stayed most of  saturday  at home ( didn't even shave for the day ), played a time-consuming game on the computer, and that was it.    sunday ... set an alarm for 8am, decided to sleep a couple of minutes more, ended up rousing around 9am, the couple of minutes became an hour... went to mass, had an early lunch and then accompanied by bro and sis to the mall. didn't get to buy anything even if there was a sale.  ever notice that some shops take their good inventory off the shelf and replace it with old inventory during sales?  in my opinion, that was what contributed to me not buying anything.  when we got home, our cousins were already there for our weekly get-together. one of them had an important announcement.  he was going to propose to his long-time girlfriend tomorrow night  and needed the family's help to stage it. this really didn't come as a surprise, but still this is a welcome development in the clan.  best wishes ...  ====   i'm again planning to cut class tomorrow night to lend moral support to my cousin.

       Speaking Engagement   auditioned yesterday for voice talents, went with  Sam ... the experience was so empowering, getting to speak out with different voices and potentially getting paid thereafter. cool.  it wasn't like the other studios we went to, most of them told us they'd call us back for an audition but when we got to this particular studio yesterday, they readily accomodated us. the one who took charge of the audition was  Grace , she was the sound editor there and she was only my age, maybe younger. she was cool. thanx Grace.  =)   for my audition, i did a few radio commercial spiels for some consumer products and then after they asked me to do some character voices... the kid in me struck again. i did Stitch, Gollum, Barney (the dinosaur), Ernie (Sesame Street)... they were most impressed with my  Stitch  voice....  hehe =p   hope they do call back... even if i only get one gig from them i'd be happy.  ====   Ohana mean family... family stick together, no one get left behind...

       When does the hurting stop?   a fairly familiar line from one of the cartoons of yesteryears... i find myself uttering the same words myself. last night, after 3 weeks of non-activity, we ( my cousins and i ) finally mustered up the quorum to play badminton. there were only 6 of us. on the way there we frantically tried to contact our other friends to join us, only one of them came.  when we got there, there were only a few people and the owner agreed to train 3 of us ( Tina, Angel and me ). that was the first time i actually trained in the proper footwork for badminton and it was kinda hard to get rid of not-so good habits... my footwork was all wrong.  =p   quite frankly, that was the first time i got really tired before our first hour was over. this also explains the title above. right now, the whole of my right leg is still stiff and i may not be able to drive later.  *damn*   i really do need to get in shape, the trainor told me my knees are weak. he advised me to do shuttleruns everyday... well maybe i'll start tomorrow.  =p   ====    Ronnie : (to me and my sister) Seriously, who's older?  Me : (to myself) iba na talaga pag babyfaced... hehehe...   ====   2 papers due... have to start with at least one of 'em...

       Retail Credit Cards?   i had another wierd dream last night. we were in a mall and passed by a certain store that sells credit cards for retail... there were all kinds of credit cards: Visa, Mastercard, and Diners. foreign and local. its like whats happening with prepaid cellcards today only that they have a credit line.  maybe this idea would really come to be if and when credit background investigations would be a thing of the past, when trust would be held of utmost importance. when a simple promise would be held as binding and as legal as a written contract. a time when people said "yes" and really meant it.  would there really be a time?  ====   2 papers due, haven't started... damn.

       Of Winners and those Not-So Lucky...   i found myself watching the  76th Academy Awards (Oscars)  today... it started around 10am and finished at 3pm (local time). Billy Crystal was hilarious! as always, it was a showcase of the best and brightest in the film industry. they say being nominated is honor enough... the winners well-deserve their awards. kudos to LOTR: Return of the King for garnering 11 awards.  in contrast to the recently held  2004 MTV Asia Awards ... best male performer went to Gareth Gates...  who the hell is Gareth Gates???  is he really that good, besting the likes of Justin Timberlake? not that Mr. Timberlake is any good either, but at least he's famous.  sidenote: i hope there would come a time when a Filipino would be nominated or even accept an Oscar.  ====   "To Julie, I said this in a note I passed in 8th grade and now I have the chance to say it in front of 8 billion people...

       Fuel and Time...   i was supposed to go to class earlier this evening... it takes me a little over 45 minutes to get there from home... i was 10 minutes away from school when one of my classmates texted me, telling me that the class for tonight  is cancelled ...  damn .  we were supposed to be done with our group report... we were supposed to discuss our class outing... we were supposed to do lots of things... then the class was cancelled.  so i just went back home, packed some stuff and went off to the badminton court ( in Makati )... well, beats doing nothing, right?  oh and about the title again... those were the 2 things i seem to have wasted today...  Fuel and Time ... next time i'll be bringing my gear in the car, just in case class gets cancelled again...  =p   ====   i'm not mediocre, right? hmmm...

       The Pain...   just got home from school and dinner out with some classmates... we had our exam in industry analysis, open notes... it was not too difficult, but it was  loooooong ... the proctor handed us a 20 something page case for a certain firm and the exam took all 3 hours of the session...  2 questions .  *damn*   we were also informed that our final paper would be due in 2 weeks... and the presentations would be out of town...  wee!!!  still have to discuss it with our class where to have it...  any suggestions?   had dinner at Oody's Greenbelt...  again ... i think i've finally had enough of that place... next time we should go to another place...  Greenbelt has become a melting pot of just about any type of person... some not-so-desirable personalities can be found there... people just seem to " hook-up " there...  =p   oh yeah, about the title...

       Another Angsty Moment...   sometimes we're surrounded by so many overwhelming things happening around us... unfathomable to the point that it distracts us and makes us stop and think a while. questions abound on the " what-ifs " in life...   what if i was born in to another family? what if my parents had raised me in another way? what if i had chosen to be the  naughty boy  in elementary? what if high school was different? what if i had attended this college instead of the one i finished my education from? what if i had chosen this path instead of the one i am at right now?  these are old questions that had kept on bugging me since time in memorial... they have been the " roots " of my  angsty exaggerations . however, maybe its time to look at my life through another point of view... instead of thinking about the " what-ifs ", how about focusing on the " why-nots? "  well, just because the " why-nots " have been few and far in between ( as far as i can remember )... i have considered myself as a go-getter... i know what i want and when i do want it, i do almost everything to achieve it... if i don't get what i want ( after everything i've put in to it ), then it becomes a " what-if ".  =p   a backgrounder on today's angsty exaggeration... earlier i saw a particular post on a site ( which i won't divulge much of ) that said " why didn't they just be...? " well i have a simple reply to that... it just isn't. it may happen but not now, i'm open to just about anything though there's something else going for us. maybe it'll be like a  My Best Friend's Wedding  scenario.. i don't know, the future maybe... its just not certain and there are issues in between ( or maybe its just my escapist self thats talking here ).  ====   was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me? oh things are gonna happen naturally ... it's okay if you have to go away just remember the telephone works both ways but if i never hear it ring if nothing else i'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else and  thats okay  coz i'll remember everything you said...

       Whaddaday...   been up since 4.30am... why? well i had an early morning orientation/interview with one of my dream companies... it was for an business process outsourcing post...  no its not a call center ! although the shift follows the US client's time. so there i was, i spent the morning there. first there was an orientation about the company... then we had a typing exam, did 44wpm at 96% accuracy...  kinda slow coz my hands were freezing ! then there was an attention to detail test, its kind of a toughie coz we had to compare sets of alphanumeric arrays...  kakaduling !  then there was an interview, its safe to say that i impressed the interviewer being the  renaissance man  that i am  *ehem, ehem*  she even suggested that if i get accepted that i try out being a trainor for the company (added income)...  kewl...  but what the heck, i want to get accepted... i'm a big fan of the company... if i don't get in, its their loss...  finished with the interview around 12.30pm, had lunch at a McDonald's drive-thru... i noticed something quite amusing with the two cars in front of me... the first car had a license plate of   AUN -888  while the other had   ETU -777 ... its a bit hard to find the humor there, but there is... trust me.  decided to go home first seeing that its a tad bit too early to go to school... took a nap which was a bad move, my head felt like its being split in two when i woke up an hour later... add to that, i still have a sore throat.  so i got to school, had class... there were two guest speakers and one was going to lecture about the role of ethics in HR... i found myself listening intently to his lecture... he was a great speaker. he definitely knew what he was discussing. after class, we had dinner at Oody's Greenbelt... again. the waiter even greeted us: " welcome back sir... " sure sign that they haven't forgotten us.  =p   so here i am, at home in front of my computer... its 1am, head's still throbbing, throat's still sore... but hey, i can look forward to sleep... at last.   gnyte. =)   ====   can we just stop and talk a while?

       Seven Churches...   today is Maundy Thursday... our family went on a  Visita Iglesia ... did seven churches this time, hence the title. started around 9.30am, done by 11.30am... the last church we went to was  St. James the Great Parish  in Alabang... that church was an utter...  WOW!!!  i wanna get married there... well, if i get married... i hope i do... i want to have a family, but not now...  near future?  maybe... i don't know. got to get me a girlfriend first then i'll probably wing it from there.  =p   anyway, when we got there, the  church people  were practicing for the Easter mass... as in all of them, from the choir to the altar servers, the lectors and commentator to the lay ministers...  just how organized could they get?   had lunch at my aunt's place... ate spaghetti putanesca... no meat... no tomato sauce... she used whole tomatoes and veggies...  *yum*  my youngest cousin  Mico  is growing fast... he seems to get taller and heftier every week...  good sign.   tomorrow's  Good Friday ... the day the Christ  died ... still can't get the vision of  The Passion  movie out of my head... man that was some movie... very unusual for a religion-based flick. kudos to Mel Gibson, Jim Caviezel and the rest to the cast and crew...  fearless forecast: the Oscar is yours .  ====  a few days ago there appeared a column in  The Inquirer  about the  Vow Breakers ... stories of women that embraced unfamiliar roles in their family, in a sense not following their marital vows. my mom pointed to me a paragraph that perfectly captured what's going on in our family. i'd like to tell you more about it but with due respect to my parents, i'd just ask you to read the said article and pick among the scenarios listed.  ====   i don't want to be like him... i can't let myself become what i despise the most...

       The Passion...   got to watch  The Passion of Christ  earlier this evening and it was just plain...  WOW!!!  the movie was gruesome but great... almost broke me to tears for most part...  *sigh*   if it were me who knew that tomorrow i'd die under the hands of my own people, i would forsake them... but the Christ was the Christ... He knew He had to suffer and die, there were instances when He seemed to question his fate but in the end, He accepted the Father's will... wish i had that much faith.  ====   Father... forgive me...

       Game, Set, Match...   played badminton earlier with my cousins, had a few games, drank  Aqua Blue  mineral water ( hi  Kinz  ).... its sooo refreshing.  =)   promised my mom i wouldn't eat after we've done playing 'cause already had an early dinner before going to the court... but the temptation was just too great!!!  its only on some occassions that i get to share a meal with my cousins ( well, every week is an occassion ) and its just to much to pass off... so we had dinner out... i ate... a lot.   justification:  an argument was raised by one of my cousins ( Chris ), he said: " just think of it this way... if we didn't play badminton, we would've just had dinner... but since we played, we lost some of the fat that we would've gained anyway... " well, in my opinion, its a valid point.  =p   oh well, tomorrow we'll be playing again... hope its not too hot this time.  ====   heaven knows... i'm head over heels and it shows... there's something about you when you're around... i have found i get lost in you...

       Another Day After...   we celebrated my birthday last night at our place... friends and family came. this was one of the rare moments that the  ^Angels^  were complete... i felt so touched.  i am happy. =)   friends met friends...  Eman  and  Rocel  hit it off with a heart-felt conversation of just about anything under the sun ( and some things better left between the two ). its a great thing when a friend from one group gets to know another friend from a different group.  convergence. =)   oh and  Sam , baked me a cake with coffee crumble on top...  *yum*   the main event started off with  Kim  having her " revenge " by making me down two birthday shots ( a jigger-full of the alcoholic drink of the night )...  thank you . 5 minutes in to the main event, i was heavily buzzed.  =p   as the hours wound down, i found myself consulting  Jao ,  Mai ,  Rocel ,  Lycel  and  Deb  about my next venture. they said i should start small-time, doing odd projects for schools, students, small companies, etc.  good point . but i can't help it but always go for the big-time... i am an entrepreneur... i should be relatively optimistic... sometimes to a fault. but hey, that's how i am.  after that, everything seems to be a blur... which is good,  i think . for the first time since i started celebrating my birthday with my ^Angels^,  i did not smoke... weeee!!!   thanks to those who came... and for those who didn't make it... you missed a lot. and for those who left early... you should've stayed longer.  =)   ====   everything is wonderful now...

       Bureaucracy...   i hate bureaucracy... the big-long word that best describes the apparent slow pace of coming up with a decision required 10 minutes ago. bureaucrats are everywhere, in school, at work, politics... you name it, its there. its the main reason why bottlenecks in the system occur.  why do we need 10 signatures just to have a light bulb changed?  the reason...  bureaucracy .  we are supposed to have our outing/presentation at Caliraya this Friday. its been at least 2 weeks since i sent out the required proposal to the " authorities "... up to now there is no decision yet whether they would allow our class out-of-town or not. the thing is, the resort needed our final decision last week.  i've been stressed out all day because of it. *dammit*   i was also watching the Joint Session of Congress earlier today, they were discussing the National Canvass for the top two posts in the country... they've been at it since last week and they just started counting around 4pm today.  bureaucrats .  ====   everyone's working for world peace but there's a long line of red tape to get to it.

       Rise and Fall...   taking a look back on what has transpired over my life in general... change is the only constant... good or bad... growth or backslide... this is me.  i've been wondering why lately i've been interested books that test my faith... maybe coz i've been reading  Dan Brown 's books. they may be fictional events, but the facts are true. i finished the  Da Vinci Code  a few weeks ago and i'm currently immersed in  Angels & Demons . i have 2 books that are in my  To Read  list:  Templar Revelation  and  The Dark Side of Catholicism  ( if i had the title right ).  quick info... i used to be a servant in our church community. first, a member of the children's choir... then an altar servant... then a leader of a youth group. now, i don't even give a f*ck what happens in the youth group i was affiliated to... sometimes i intentionally miss Sunday mass... i don't even pray at night.  what has happened to my faith?   am i too engrossed in the world and its pursuits that i forget that i am answerable to a higher power? or am i not convinced anymore that the prophets are indeed telling the truth?  prophets... the Bible was written by prophets with the inspiration of their faith in God. but aren't all prophets only human and subject to their own biases? some books were written way after the transpiration of the events they describe. it has been said that because the Bible was originally written in ancient scrolls and subsequently translated to more understandable language, some parts have been dutifully editted. some Gospels didn't even make it to the modern day Bible because they portray Jesus more as a human than as a Messiah.  anybody know where i can find a compilation of the Gnostic Gospels?   bottomline... i find myself difficult to be convinced by human works and propaganda. just like politicians, priest and pastors are tasked to convince and lead the faith... but aren't they all but human? they have flaws, they make mistakes... quite frankly, i don't wish to place my faith under the guidance of someone who makes mistakes.  i can make my own mistakes, i do not need anyone to make them for me.   ====   this for now... more change is imminent.

       Knee-deep in Sh*t...    i had a bad day...  "bad" seems to be an understatement... earlier today, i went to the LTO district office to renew my car's registration... but before that, i was waiting for the Certificate of Cover to be delivered by the insurance agent ( it arrived at 10.30am, was waiting since Monday ). got to the LTO at 11am, almost lunchtime... usually, the ordeal of renewing a car registration takes an hour or so depending on the number of customers.  so there i was, in line for the smoke emission testing... my car was fourth on queue... after a few minutes of waiting, the tester's computers went offline...  OFFLINE !!! emission testing came to a halt for 30 minutes or so. my turn came at lunchtime, the testers promised to finish the pending queue before taking a break ( so considerate )... my car's smoke emission test finished by 12.30pm...  passed with flying colors .  now to the LTO district office... since it was lunchtime, and the LTO staff was on break, i decided to have my lunch there. 1pm came... supposedly break was over... so i headed for the evaluator to have my documents encoded... guess what? there was a  BLACKOUT !!! nobody could work the computers... there was no ventilation... nothing! just across the LTO are a few eateries, and they had electricity!!!  *grrr*   i wanted to transfer to another LTO district office but my documents were already with the evaluator so i had no choice but wait. the lights went on just before 2pm... finished everything at 2.30pm... damn... 3 hours wasted on something that usually takes an hour.   ====   if you can recall, i had another bad experience with the LTO on the day of my birthday when i went to renew my driver's license... sh*t.   ====  had our group case report today for finance... it went fine... no biggie.  received word that the chance of our outing/final paper presentation is slim... too much bureaucracy.  =(   ====  Fantasia Barrino won the top prize in American Idol...  kewl .  ====   big black boots... long brown hair... she's so sweet with that get back stare...

       When Nobody's Around...   its been a few days since i last blogged... kinda miss it but i didn't have anything much to say (or write). i didn't do much last week, even over the weekend. i was busy with " work " and school... busy with arranging our class outing.  just hope the management committee approves it ...  my sister had her badminton tournament last saturday... i made a deal with her that if she wins at least one game, i'd treat her somewhere... her record was 1 win, 4 losses. that's ok i guess, considering she had a non-cooperative partner.  =p   today is my dog's birthday... happy birthday  Milo .  about the title... kinda weird... the angsty side is trying to kick in again. last tuesday, had a YM conversation with  Sam ... i just rambled on and on saying, " if ever i'd disappear, i wouldn't be missed... " well would i?  would anyone even notice i'm gone? does anyone really care? sure there are friends that say they are real friends... but will they notice? do they really know who i am? do i let them know who i am? why can't i just open up this book and let everyone see what it is inside?  i think its just the effect of the weather, its so gloomy outside... it rained for most of last week. speaking of the weather... i wanna watch  The Day After Tomorrow ... another apocalyptic flick, this time its about changing weather patterns...  it could happen .  ====   when nobody's around... i think of you... do you think of me too?   ====   Some fine day when we go walking We’ll take time for idle talking  Sharing every feeling as we watch each other smile I’ll hold your hand you’ll hold my hand We’ll say things we never had planned Then we’ll get to know each other in a little while   But for now let me say I love you  Later on there’ll be time for so much more But for now meaning now and forever Let me kiss you my darling then once more - " But For Now ", Jamie Cullum

       The Week That Was...   its been one helluva week for me and those around me ( the country in particular )... the local national elections has finished, much time is being spent counting and verifying the polls. as of now the " cute economist/incumbent chief-executive " is leading the presidential race... as of now, the leading vice-president is her runningmate, and her party has the majority of the senatorial slate. things are looking up for  Mrs. Arroyo .  started a new set of subjects for class. this time we have  Economic History and Development  and  Corporate Aspects of Finance ... i feel very confident that i'm gonna ace the finance subject coz that's what i'm in to and the faculty-in-charge seems to be a likeable person. kinda doubtful on the economic history subject.  too many readings are required ...  watched  Troy  last friday, it starred Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, et al. it was a genuine  WOW ! the movie was great... the screenplay was fabulous and the acting was adequate. i consider the fight scenes to be the highlight of the film...  superb ! bought GoNuts Donuts after the movie.  =p   was in  Greenhills  saturday with my sister, bought a new pair of sneakers... great find. saw an antique  Yashica twin-lens reflex camera , it was made between 1970-1985, and i think its older than i am. the damn camera kept me up last night just thinking about it.  today, guess what? i was again in Greenhills before some shops even opened... why? because i decided to buy for myself the same camera that kept me up all night. yes, i bought the Yashica Mat 124 G twin-lens reflect camera. the good thing is, it still works though needs some cleaning a few minor repairs... but all-in-all, another great find.  i also sold some stuff today at a garage sale... outcome, not too bad for a day's " work ".  ====   weekend's over... new week's beginning... what now?

       Criteria...   technically its election day here in the Philippines...  ideally, the fate of the nation depends on the hands of its voting populous, but there have been issues raised by the possibility of massive cheating and a consequencial failure of elections  the Japanese are terrified of this scenario, mainly because of their pronounciation and accent... failure of erections! =p *joke,joke,joke*    but seriously, the country is faced with a choice between extending the term of the current  lady of the house , entrusting the nation to a high-school drop-out  actor  with no experience in politics, a well-educated  former senator  running for president for the 2nd time but is rumored to have prostate cancer, or an  evangelist  that united masses during rallies but still fared poorly on surveys. choices are to be made... the next few hours would define the next six years of the nation.  just what are the criteria for choosing between candidates? political will? moral ascendance? charm for the masses? well for me, the main criteria is the ability to get the job done. too bad i won't be able to vote... i didn't make it to the voters' registrations because i was  too busy  that time...   ====   whatever happens... i have no right to complain...

       Done With...   finally the curse and burden known as  Social and Business Ethics  class is over... done with... finished... all papers handed-in... took the final exam.  did i learn anything? well... maybe... i dunno... i think i still have a firm grasp of my crooked sense of ethics, any residual effects of that class would be discarded in time.  next week's the start of a new module in class... hope the prof's would be good.  when i got home and turned the tube on, there was  Alicia Keys ... singing one of her songs on a Tonight Show re-run... damn she's so beautiful... if i do get to meet her, i'd die.  ===   Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power Some people live just to play the game  Some people think that the physical things define what's within And I have been there before, and that life's a bore So full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothing at all If it ain't you baby If I ain't got you baby -  If I Ain't Got You , Alicia Keys

       12 Days Since...   12 days since i last posted in my blog... been busy recently... spent more time last week out with classmates doing a paper.  my body clock is messed up, can't get to sleep early ( 10pm ) even if i try to... i often get to sleep at 2am... the latest i went to bed was 5.30am friday, the sun was already up... my head still hurts coz of the lack of sleep.  i finally bought a copy of Dan Brown's  The Da Vinci Code , although i haven't started reading it yet... lent it to my mom first coz i knew she's been wanting to read the book ever since my cousin brought his copy over.  more people have been telling me that i am thinner ( or less fat ) than i used to be... can't be a good sign coz i don't get to exercise much, it means that all the stress is slowly killing me. oh well... at least i get to fit in some shirts that i've been wanting to wear.  =p   i miss my friends... my  ^Angels^ ...  ====   this love has taken its toll on me... she said goodbye too many times before...

       Over the So-called Hump...   today is wednesday... the so-called  hump day ... the middle of the week. but in my case it feels as if its over-the-hump-day. why?  well its because last night, my group and i had a breakthrough. during our first few sessions with this certain prof, he told us that only a few of us would actually graduate with a master's degree and that most of us would fail his subject ( as his reputation preceeds him )... and that he'd have his day come finals time.  last week though, in my opinion, he was impressed with our class participation that he decided to skip our final exam and instead require a case report... last night, we had our case report and my group succeeded in making him laugh...  not an easy feat... also very unusual of him to laugh during class .  so that was my over-the-hump story... do you have one?  ====   "I have nothing to declare except my genius..." -  Oscar Wilde

      hands down, definitely my all-time fave movie... no matter how many times i watch it, it never fails to inspire me...  to hope ... keep the faith... stay firm... never forget that there's a light in the end of the tunnel... even when everything seems to just crumble around you, when the world seems to go against you...  hold on hope .  ====     &nbsp;   Hold On Hope     - Guided by Voices -     &nbsp;  Every street is dark and folding out mysteriously   Where lies the chance we take to be always working   Reaching out for a hand that we can't see   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me    &nbsp;  Invitation to the last dance then it's time to leave   But that's the price we pay when we deceive one another   Animal mother, she opens up for free   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me    &nbsp;  Look at the talkbox in mute frustration   At the station there hides the cowboy   His campfire flickering on the landscape   That nothing grows on    But time still goes on and through each life of misery   Everybody's got a hold on hope   It's the last thing that's holding me   ====  never forget that there's always a friend you could turn to... they might not be at your side at all times but they are always in your heart.   *sigh*  i really miss the ^Angels^... though i've seen&nbsp;some of them the past week, it still doesn't measure up to the times when we're all together, just chillin'... hanging out at a friend's place, talking about nothing in particular. just being with each other.  *sigh*   i'm&nbsp;preparing for another hectic weekend, most of the&nbsp;time would be for schoolwork... got tons of it...  and i thought management subjects would be easy. =p   ===   could've been somebody but things didn't seem to turn out right... time to take action.

       Feel So Empty...   i don't know what got in to me today... was it caused by the complete lack of coffee today? i don't know... was it because i had a dreadful weekend? maybe... but it seemed like i was so restless today. i just couldn't sit still... a friend told me my anxiety bordered on weird.  i was completely jittery during class earlier tonight... and it didn't help that the prof was boring. he was supposed to teach, he is paid to teach... but what did he do? he just wasted our time rambling about trivial things. i was bored out of my ears. with an hour to go with class, i was cursing the teacher under my breath. i was raring to leave, have dinner with my classmates and go home.  i feel so empty... i am pretty sure i am overflowing with ideas that could spark the next big thing but i lack an outlet to let loose what i have in mind. there's no one i could vent the steam building inside me, no one would listen.  i need to be more productive... i need a means to generate&nbsp;some capital&nbsp;and thereafter acquire assets that would create wealth or at least create a flow of currency.  there goes business jargon again ... i've been reading more business books recently, some as required for my degree and others just to enhance my knowledge and financial intelligence.  Kiyosaki is a god!   ====   feel so empty though i am so full... had a heavy dinner. =p

       Enjoy The Weekend...   i know i won't... i'd be doing some schoolwork during the weekend, got 3 consecutive case reports to do. on Sunday it'd be my lil cousin's birthday party, i most probably won't be there coz i'd have to meet with my classmates.  =(   we were supposed to go out tonight, the  ^Angels^  and i... but the plan didn't push through coz of the mismatch in schedules and it was simply not meant to happen.  *sigh*  i miss them, its been a month since we last saw each other.  =(    ====    &nbsp;   Vindicated    - Dashboard Confessional -    &nbsp;  Hope dangles on a string   Like slow spinning redemption   Winding in and winding out   The shine of it has caught my eye   And roped me in   So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing    I am captivated , I am    &nbsp;  Vindicated   I am selfish   I am wrong   I am right   I swear I'm right   I swear I knew it all along    And I am flawed     But I am cleaning up so well     I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself     &nbsp;  So clear   Like the diamond in your ring   Cut to mirror your intention   Oversized and overwhelmed   The shine of which has caught my eye   And rendered me   So isolated, so motivated   I am certain now that I am    &nbsp;  So turn   Up the corners of your lips   Part them and feel my finger tips   Trace the moment, fall forever   Defense is paper thin   Just one touch and I'd be in   Too deep now to ever swim against the current    So let me slip away    So let me slip away   So let me slip away    So let me slip against the current    So let me slip away   So let me slip away   So let me slip away   So let me slip away    &nbsp;   My hope     Dangles on a string    Like slow spinning redemption...    &nbsp;

       A Gracious Let-Down...    earlier today i had my third... yes, third appointment with the automotive retailer that i've blogged about recently. as usual, they were an hour off in meeting with me.  i've spent about 5 hours (accumulated) waiting in their office since my first ever appointment there. &nbsp;this time i'd be meeting with the sales manager.   he was in his early to mid-30s, i could tell he was a real salesperson... he went straight to the point and addressed the issue of my pursuing a post-graduate degree and asked if i would be able to give my 100% given the fact that my schedule would be affected by my studies. he asked what if a conflict in schedules arise, would i prioritize school or work?   i gave him a blunt answer that i would have to prioritize my studies and he thereafter agreed with the point i raised. he also asked if other career opportunities would arise after i graduate, how would i handle the situation? well, i gave another blunt answer...  greener pastures .   to end the appointment, the sales manager advised me to stick with my graduate program, give it my top priority for the moment. i agree with him, education is something of utmost importance and yes it is in the top of my list of priorities.   basically that was the gracious let-down... he&nbsp;advised me to finish my degree and if i still wanted to pursue a career with them, re-apply after i graduate for a managerial position...  yeah, like i'd even want to be part of&nbsp;that organization ... but i've been known to eat my words at times. oh well, there goes that... on to the next venture.   ====    ready... set... go...

       New Set...  &nbsp; tonight we start a new set of subjects/modules for class... i can safely say that we're&nbsp;over-the-hump of our masters progam... we're on the last 6 subjects of a 16 module degree... 14 more units to go before the end of the program. &nbsp; this time around, we'd be taking up  Corporate Aspects of Production  and  Corporate Aspects of Marketing ... well, back in college, i did fairly well in marketing and barely passed production so i guess my chances are favorable this term.  =p  &nbsp;  *sigh*  how time flies when you're having fun... and i am having the time of my life!!! at the start of the program, i swore myself that i would absorb as much as i could from my studies and eventually graduate armed with a thesis that i would be proud of. i never considered making friends a requirement for my masters degree. i never thought i'd find people i would be able to relate with. &nbsp; i never thought i'd meet people who'd make a definite dent in my life... what i have experienced and shared with them had definitely been meaningful. i never thought i'd meet people who'd eventually become like family to me. &nbsp; i do believe this is why we're the best  ABEP  batch there is... its not about the honors and awards we receive... its about the people and the core strength of the batch as a whole...  friendship . &nbsp; ==== &nbsp;  i sort of pity the 2K6 batch... they don't seem to be interacting with each other much...  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

       The Deal    before i start, i'd like to comment first on Blogger's the new text formatting lay-out...  cool new features!!!   &nbsp;  anywayz, here's what i really have to say... yesterday (friday), i honored my appointment with the automotive dealer and may i say that despite the GM being an  hour and a half  late  again ,     the interview went quite favorable. he briefed me on what i would be expecting if and when i come aboard.  &nbsp;  after the meeting, i decided to go to school and try to answer some of the take-home questions given us... saw 4 of my classmates there as they were also trying to solve the exam, i decided to join them and basically got the impression that most of my answers were correct, pending the opinion of my accountant friend.  =p   &nbsp;  i'd be meeting with 3 of my classmates tomorrow after lunch to discuss our answers... and together, we form the  Fab 4  of  ABEP 2K5 .  =)   &nbsp;  earlier today, i attended a  CYM  gathering... the exhortation of my friend who led the prayer meeting definitely struck a chord.  everything will fall in to place when you trust in God . i've been trying to get in touch with my faith recently and i have observed that things do seem to fall in to place when i trust in the Lord. things seem clearer, predicaments seem easier to surpass.  &nbsp;  i missed being in the company of the people from CYM... which is why, i have vowed to stick with them once again. enough time has been wasted by backsliding... in fact, i spent a little over a year in the ditch before i returned to the community...  and by golly, it feels great to be back!!!   &nbsp;  ====  &nbsp;   to hate means to lack reason in thought... logic would suggest we would all want to feel good right?   &nbsp;

       Not Quite Done Yet...   we had our final exam for Finance earlier tonight... it was not quite what i had expected and reviewed for. i blocked out in the first few minutes of the exam and couldn't figure out how to answer the questions.   first part was a  true-or-false , wasn't able to do well coz i didn't read any of the theoretical stuff. then there was the  problem-solving  section, unfortunately too many ideas were rushing through my brain and hindered me from getting the answers as quickly as i would like.  *dammit*   the prof told us that the exam would be half  sit-thru  and half  take-home ... i was wondering which half was the take-home until she said that we should answer as much of the exam possible until 8pm and the take-home part would be the whole exam itself. she'd be checking the sit-thru part to assess our scores and then we'd be submitting another set of answers next week, whichever has the higher score would be our final score for the exam... if we get relatively high scores on both occassions, then we'd be receiving a bonus grade.  =p   anyhoo, guess what? i had another cup of vanilla latte tonight and i might be awake til dawn again.  =p   and another thing, remember the interview i was supposed to have last tuesday (July 13) with the GM of the automotive retailer that was rescheduled for tomorrow at 4pm... i've decided to honor my appointment.  sayang naman yung chance di ba?  i'd have to leave by 2.30pm tomorrow considering the traffic in that area...   wish me luck... again... and pray they'd be fulfilling their end of the bargain.  ====   come fly with me, let's fly... let's fly away...

       Running Joke...   earlier today, the Philippine government announced the pull-out of troops sent to Iraq in response to a  kababayan  taken hostage there. this does not bode well for the image porjected by the Philippines to the world.   the US granted a  $144 million military aid  to the Philippines for their participation in the peace-keeping efforts in the Middle East. now we decide to pull-out our troops, we can't return the aid given us... its already been allocated to the  top officials  and some legitimate projects.  ====  the country has become the subject of a running joke... it didn't help that we became part of an opening monologue of a US talk show.  excerpts from The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (07-14-2004), opening monologue:  The Philippines today announced they'd withdraw their troops from Iraq... all 51 of them. *oooohhh* Big deal, P. Diddy has a bigger posse! OK everyone in the Humvee, let's go...   and on a sketch in the same show:   Jay Leno : Mr. President [Bush]... how do you feel about the Philippines' pull out from Iraq?  "Bush" : I'm disappointed... and I've banned the use of Manila folders...   ====  i know its not proper to be swayed by what others say... but still, we gave our word that we'd help... we knew the risks. they knew the risks and yet they persisted.  ====   we are a small-open economy... open because we need to trade with other economies... small because we can't influence world prices... we are not the center of the universe... deal with it.

Yet Another Vanilla Latte   coffee is good... coffee brings out the best in people in the worst of times. coffee makes you feel good when you're down. it energizes you for the challenges ahead. a sudden surge of energy, enough to get you through.  coffee is like a good lover, it keeps you up through the night ... and it looks like i'll be up til dawn again.  i think its safe to say that i am a big fan of coffee though i don't get to drink that much that often... but when i do, i relish every last sip.  my usual cup of joe is a tall vanilla latte... why? i don't have an idea... it just brings two of my favorites together, coffee and vanilla.  vanilla vs. chocolate, i'd definitely choose vanilla.  chocolate's too typical.  =p   ====  i was supposed to have an interview with an  automotive retailer  earlier today ( or yesterday if you're being technical )... the appointment was set at  3pm  and i'd be speaking with the  general manager . they said they were offering me to be part of their pioneering team to re-launch their re-positioned product line.  i was there at 3.05pm, granted i was late, i was ready to apologize for my tardiness... but alas, when i got there, they told me to wait. there were already 3 candidates present making me the fourth to arrive. it was  4pm  and the GM still wasn't available, but it was ok for me to wait a bit more, maybe he was busy.  then the HR officer approached us, telling us that the GM was tied up at the moment in a meeting and that he'd get back to us as soon as he is available. it was  5pm  when the interviews started, he had finished with 2 candidates and then the GM got up once more from his desk, he was called for another meeting.   5.45pm  i decided to leave... i told the HR officer that i'd be leaving because i still had a class, and that when we set the appointment for today, she assured me that it won't take long and that it won't encroach on my class schedule.  well, it did.   she set me another appointment for friday at  4pm ... i'm having second thoughts whether i'd be going or not.  if they didn't show any sign of professionalism in keeping their appointments,  why should i ?   ====   thank God for coffee!!!   ====    Welcome (To My Little Island)  - Patrick Nuo -  little explosions  shinin` through the sky  vivid emotions  were comin` down into my mind   a little confusion -  I thought I should take the chance  for a little illusion  and a magical experience    the sky turned red and then she said:  welcome - she said welcome   she said: welcome to my little island  the place where your fears are turnin` silent   there is no more need to cry  I take the sadness from your eyes   she said welcome to my little island  the place where your fears are turnin` silent  no there ain`t no need to cry  I take the saidness from your eyes  she said welcome - she said welcome   a little blue ocean  a private hiding place  a little love potion  as I watched the sunrise on her face  a little invention  it seemed like heaven sent  another dimension  and this magical experience  the sky turned red and then she said:   welcome to my little island  the place where your fears are turnin` silent  there is no more need to cry  I take the sadness from your eyes  she said welcome to my little island  the place where your fears are turnin` silent  no there ain`t no need to cry  I take the saidness from your eyes  she said welcome - she said welcome    and now here I am inviting you  to come into my life  I hope you have a pleasant flight  into my dreams tonight    you are welcome  you`re welcome  welcome  she said welcome

       A Correct Mistake...   it happened last thursday night, during one of my classes... i received a text message from someone i don't know... i asked who the person was and then the sender apologized for sending to the wrong number... it was but a mistake. a few minutes later, i received the same text message from the same sender so i told the sender that  she  made another mistake.  how did i know it was a  she ? well, she asked me first then i asked her.  =p simple =p  what followed was a whirlwind of text messages... good thing the prof didn't notice me texting during class and that the class itself was boring.  i called her up the next day on my cellphone on my way home from an appointment. the meeting was in Greenhills so the call was long... as in 37 minutes long.  *dammit*  now i'm over my minutes for the month, and its only the start of my billing month!!!  she seems like a good person, outgoing and personable... she doesn't sound her age, her voice exudes youth ( btw, she's 25 ). we've been talking on the phone ( this time on the landline ) since friday. maybe i could meet up with her soon.  ====  later, i'll have another appointment in Greenhills, this time i'd be interviewed by the GM of an automotive retailer. their planning to launch their product line by the end of the month and would like me to be part of their team.  wish me luck. =)   ====   i don't have a quote right now... maybe later. =p

       Thought for the Moment...   just wondering... can anybody out there teach me how to do html or any other web design tool? i'm tired of using these templates for my blog.  =p   ====  we have class later... just learned that we've been kicked out of our original room to make way for the new batch of ABEP hopefuls.  oh well, that's life... or some semblance of it anyway.  ====   fire in the hold!!!

       Another Bout of Frustration and Angst...   i don't know why, but its happening again... this morning, i found myself once again pondering on the missed prospects and unfulfilled dreams i once had...  unexacted realities .  why couldn't i be what i want to be? why do i always have to be the one to compromise?  why does it always rain on me?   i wanted to work in a work-conducive environment... i want to be able to share my knowledge to others and partake on their exchange of ideas... i need to be able to use what i've learned and apply these  theories  to real life. believe me, i have lot's to share but everything's pent up inside me.  maybe that's my fault... i know a lot about most things and none about the important things... the one's that count...  maybe that's why i don't count .  why is it that they don't see me? am i truly invisible? or maybe they do see but they just don't bother to take a second look?  i need to love and be loved in return...  i love to a great extent, its euphoric even... i am a romantic and it hurts when i'm not able to share this passion for life with another.  *sigh*   ====  on a lighter note... Amazing Race 5 has just started and right now, i don't have any favorites... i wonder which leg of the race will they be in the Philippines.  ====   genius is nothing but vague appreciation for trivial pursuits...

      what do i want to be? what do i need to be? am i really being true to myself and to others?  lately i've been trying to reach some semblance of my potential... i believe i do have great potential though still unrealized. i know a lot, i can help but i am being hindered by the scarcity of resources available at my disposal. i've been trying to set my mind to the belief that " there is an unlimited availability of resources for businessmen, they just have to discover where its at " as implied by the guru, Robert Kiyosaki.  i've been looking everywhere, and i see the potential for change... i know how to change it, i just haven't developed the guts for it yet.  i posted below lyrics of a very nice song... its about realizing that you can't be everything... you're not God... only human. a creature that dreams much though limited by his own strength of will.  its no rarity to meet people that dwell on the  what-ifs  and don't really think about the future nor do anything in the present. that's so sad... *sigh*  ====    I Don't Want To Be    - Gavin Degraw -      I don't need to be anything other than a prison guard's son   I don't need to be anything other than a specialist's son   I don't have to be anyone other than a birth of two souls in one   Part of where I'm going is knowing where I'm coming from       I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately     All I have to do is think of me and have peace of mind     I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do     Or who I'm supposed to be     I don't want to be anything other than me       I'm surrounded by liars everywhere I turn   I'm surrounded by imposters everywhere I turn   I'm surrounded by a identity crisis everywhere I turn   Am I the only one to notice?   I can't be the only one who's learned      I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately   All I have to do is think of me and have peace of mind   I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta do   Or who I'm supposed to be   I don't want to be anything other than me      Can I have everyone's attention please   If you're not like this and that   You're gonna have to leave   I came from the mountain, the crust of creation   My whole situation made from clay, dust, stone   And now I'm telling everybody      I don't want to be anything other than what I've been trying to be lately   All I have to do is think of me and have peace of mind   I'm tired of looking 'round rooms wondering what I gotta to do   Or who I'm supposed to be   I don't want to be anything other than me   I don't want to be   I don't want to be   I don't want to be   I don't want to be anything other than me   I don't want to be   I don't want to be   I don't want to be

      no, no... i'm not in angst-mode right now... its just one of the few titles that i've come up with eons ago. it was written on a piece of paper tucked inside a book entitled  Sales, Agency and Bailments , which we took up back in college. this means that i haven't seen that piece of paper in 4 years. 4 years since we took up that subject. on the other side of that particular piece of paper was a  price list for the bags we sold during our practicum .  =p   why i wrote down that title, i don't know... i have forgotten. was i still reeling from a past or am i flustered with the idea of the prospect of another doomed courtship?  *sigh*  good thing i've forgotten or else i'd be up all night trying to remove the thought from my mind.  earlier tonight, we had our prelim test and group report for  Operations Management ... i'm gonna fail the test but i think we did good for the presentation. another bar set high up for the next few groups to reach.  *sigh*   i was also trying to remember what the Peter Principle meant... its been bugging me for weeks and finally i got the time to browse around for it.  =p   ====    Peter Principle:    in a hierarchically structured administration, people tend to be promoted up to their "level of incompetence".      ====   and just who the heck are you? b*tch...

      as in nothing... spent another lonely satruday night at home.  *boohoo*  though i was supposed to meet up with someone at El Pueblo, she said she'd be there at 6pm 'til 10pm, much time for us to chat, hang out and share a few drinks together.  i was in the Ortigas area at 2.30pm to meet with some of my classmates for our group case for the week. we went to the Starbucks in the Metrowalk. well, it looks like it'll be another  photo-finish  effort for the presentation. we kinda came up with some viable business ideas which will potentially be the next big thing...  coming soon to a spot near you. =p   so we we're all done by 7pm-ish... i was trying to contact the girl i was supposed to meet up with, but was unsuccessful in doing so. her phone was off. well, that blew another opportunity.  *sigh* maybe we'll finally get together next week.   i just wound up going home, arrived at 8pm... nothing much to watch on the tube... just saw a replay of Tyson getting knocked out in the 4th round. he's old, he shouldn't be pushing himself too much.  ====   another lonely saturday night at home... nothing short of spectacular.
