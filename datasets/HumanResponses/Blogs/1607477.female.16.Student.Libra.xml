      well its approx. 12:00 midnight . yes im still awake im talking to brian a friend from camp, he's cool . So much drama went on since i post bout 3 hours ago. robert helped me realize alot . i need to be stronger than i am. i think the main reason i finally cracked was because its all been building up inside me. i got sent over the top though. no one knows about what happened besides justin and robert and me. i dont want to go into it because id ont want it to stir up more problems. but i want EVERYONE to know that if ive ever hurt you in any way shape or form im sorry, i truely am. i can be rude sometimes without realizing it. right now i dont feel good im gettin another stomach thing where i cant drink anythign with acid in it for about 2 weeks. i guzzeled O.J. earlier tonight. i've been depressed lately , but im starting to realize more and more that my problems arent as bad as someone elses. its not till you hear someone elses problems that you realize how insignificant your own are. i dont know,maybe im just rambling because im tired. today (thursday) is my past day to post before world changers. so ill be missing 9 days haha as if my date counter isnt screwed up enough on this thing. ill be sure to post and tell yall what happened at world changers. but for now its nighty night time! good night to all who are up reading this. and thanks robert for everything!!

      Sometimes I don’t understand why things happen in life. Two people made a bet about me today, that my ex could get me to go back out with him by the end of the night. When they told me about it I didn’t know what to say, I was shocked that one ex talked to another ex, then the fact that a bet was made kinda hurt. So one ex has been text messaging me all night about how much loved me, and how he would change. When I called to talk to him about it he told me about the bet. I didn’t know what to say, I didn’t know how to feel. I still don’t know how to feel. Maybe confused is the best way to go for me, since I seem to always find myself confused. Well Michael Ruffin got my number tonight and I got his, we are going to be spending 9 days together since we are both going on world changers. I thought it would be good to have him as a bus partner since it will be a 13 hour drive. He is cool and very sweet. But back to this bet thing, I kinda hurt since I apologized profusely on that last entry to Addison and he turned around and did that to me. I guess he had a right I don’t know; I’m not very good with these kinda things. Lately it seems like I’ve had a lot of drama, ever since camp really. Maybe God is trying to tell me something, I just don’t know what it is yet. I got two new fish today, they were a dollar. It was fun bugging Powell. Samantha got a black cat they named her Boo. We spent forever in B&B today and last night. Oh my ex found out about me and Samantha wanting to hang out with Mark and Rowdy last night, I guess he kinda has the right to be mad. I don’t know I don’t think I can say this enough to him, LEAVE ME ALONE. It’s like it never really sinks in. My mom yelled at me all the way home so for those of you that have my cell phone number I wouldn’t suggest calling it anymore since I probably wont have it for about another 2 months. I will most likely get it back when I start to drive and can’t afford the excess cost of text messages and minutes that I’ve gone over. I just thought of something, “ You reap what you sow” I’m kinda thinking this is what I sowed and now I’m getting it back, kinda like Karma ya know? My life could be a soap opera; some times I wish it was so that way it wouldn’t all be real. I’m at the realization point of my life. I realized that I need to keep my mind on the right track and pay attention to my surroundings and the little advice I get along they way helps too. I can’t ever decide if I am happy being alone or if I would rather have a boyfriend. For a while I wanted Lee, one of my best friends. I thought he would be the perfect guy for me, but I realized that I loved him too much as a friend and I knew it wouldn’t work out. I leave for world changers on Friday morning. I am so glad I get to have 9 days away from Mobile. I am miserable here. My heart is in D.C. I cant wait I only have two years left here, The day after graduation I’m getting as far away from Mobile as possible. Who knows where I will go, just as long as its far. I have a habit of running away from things, some of you reading this ( if you have read this far) might know about that habit. When I get scared I run , I run from my problems, it feels better that way, I guess because I don’t really have anyone that understands, I mean my best friend Samantha sorta understands and helps me out a lot but no one seems to fully understand the way I think, I don’t even understand how I think. It’s hard to not have someone to talk to without hearing “ I know, I’m sorry, It’ll be ok”. Many people don’t realize that when someone close to them is hurt they tend to say the same things over and over again to try to console their friend or family member.  The day someone really understands me, they will have the answers to my problems and know exactly what to say, but I think there is only one person that will ever understand that, and He is waiting for me in Heaven. There is a reason all of the things that have happened tonight, have happened. It’s part of God’s plan, and its time to wake up and realize it. I’ve been rude to a lot of people lately, mainly because of my own problems. I need to say sorry to Jon, I’ve been selfish to you and I’m so sorry! I hope you forgive me coz at this point I need as many friends as possible. I’m kinda low in that department. I miss camp a lot because I could relate to them, and everyone was nice to everyone, I guess it wasn’t really the real world, more like a fantasy world. I have made a big step to take down my Eminem posters, he’s kinda tacky anyway, he’s just junking up my wall. I’m ready to escape my problems, if anyone knows a remedy for problems and a broken, confused girl then please let me know, I’d like to be informed. Have you ever noticed that when you are in a different place, every problem big or small just seems to disappear? I guess when you are in a different surrounding you tend to forget what you left back home because you don’t wanna go back to being sad or what not. I would like to be happy for once, I should be I have so much more than some people, but it seems like I’m not satisfied there is sounding missing, sounds crazy right? Ask yourself one question... why am I still reading this? You’ve read a lot why are you still reading? Is it because reading or hearing about other peoples problems makes you feel better, makes you feel like your issues are so small compared to this crazy girl! I don’t blame you if that’s what you’re thinking. I am ready to get my movie project started that way I can focus on one thing. Some of you may have heard me say this sometime, “My life is a merry-go-round. I am sitting on the animal and every time I go up and back down it’s a new problem, but one day I will be sitting in one of the chairs that ride smoothly around life’s little up’s and down’s, but until then I have to hold on tide and pray that I don’t fall off” I guess this entry has gone a little long, but if your still reading this that’s the thought I want to leave you with, have a good night, and remember hold on when life gets bumpy, everything will be smooth eventually.

      hey yall this is my first blog so bare with me if its not to great. Today i was at six flags it was great i noticed that i have athing for boys with highlights. I got woken up this morning at 530 because an unknown someone was textmessaging me. There is something i have to say to that person, I dont love you there is no way i can. you have hurt me,annoyed my friends,and cheated. you are not worthy. as for putting me down for the past few months, this is pay back. You always made fun of me for going to ums but ya know something not everyone there is stuck up , i think you are more stuck up then half the people there, so when you talk crap make sure its straight. you are lame , and i dont care who you date or are with so dont bother wasting your time telling me. you waste your breath and energy everytime you talk to me. leave me alone, stop calling me and text messaging me. But enough bashing. I have something to say to another certian someone named Lee. Ya'll dont understand how much Lee means to me. I just wanted to say thanks to him since he has been there for me and has never missed a chance to make me feel better, so Lee thanks alot I Love You so much big bro! and to Jon thanks for making me feel better when i was down and always listening to me and talking to me at camp when you didnt have too! hahah! your a sweet and BUFF guy i wish you the best of luck durning your senior year ROLL TIDE! as for street racers that race down cottagehill road at night STOP IT race somewhere else. I know this has sounded like a huge complaint but yall are reading my thoughts so get over it. oh and to chris ballard, im going to miss you while your at boot camp! good luck! i love you soo much baldy!! haha! dont forget your lotion while your there! i dont mean for this blog to be a complaining blog i jus have alot to say. But anyways, on a more happier note i went to six flags today it was a blast- happy birthday miller - we all had fun playing the name game but anyways this post is really long good night for now  Lindsay

      hello readers, sorry for the delay in posting. my gfather was put in the hospital.. he is in ICU right now. i just left there a while ago. he had a heart attack a few days ago then went into cardiac arrest.. and his heart stopped 3 times and he stopped breathing, but by the grace of God they were able to bring him back. They had him on life support, but they took him off at about 7 pm. We all thought he would die after that but he started breathing on his own and his heart was beating on its own. it was a miracle. but they said it was the medicine which will wear offi n about 8 hours which means he may pass away at about 4 am tomorrow morning. my whole family was there today. and i saw my gfather multiple times. i prayed for him and i prayed with a few of my family members. i am glad they are all christians it makes it easier. but anyways, they took him off life support. God is keeping him here for a reason. I want to know what that reason is but its up to God whether i know or not. There is a chance that by the grace of God he will pul through. but i kidna dont want him to. idont know if that sounds wrong to yall or not. but if he pulls through there is a good chance we could end up back at the hospital again . right nowh e isnt hurting and iwant him to pass away not suffering. he will suffer if he pulls through. i dont know . this whole thing has just kinda hit me real hard. i am likea  time bomb... all my emotions are bottled up inside me ...... there is just so much im yearning to tell someone but i cant do it..i cant do it...i dont know .. i have so much going on its un believable. sometimes i feel like its just whinning and complaining but truely.. thats the only way i know how to expresss myself is to whine and complain. i dont know maybe i need a phyciatrist or someone who knows what they are talking about. anyways.. world changers for sr high will be in atlanta next year which means i get to spend my day off with sunny and alex and john and taylor. im kinda excited. i need to take my mind off things. school starts soon. im kinda glad a/b that. back into the world of studying which is something i NEVER do, but thats ok. whoever is reading this please pray for my family.. they need it.. this is hard on them.. so even if you arent saved just ask God to be with us. and if you arent saved and need to talk to me about anything or even fi you are saved and need to talk to me about anything im here..just ask...even if i dont know you.. but im gettin distracted i will post another time. good night readers Lindsay

      1 Hear, O LORD , and answer me,  for I am poor and needy.  2 Guard my life, for I am devoted to you.  You are my God; save your servant  who trusts in you.  3 Have mercy on me, O Lord,  for I call to you all day long.  4 Bring joy to your servant,  for to you, O Lord,  I lift up my soul.  5 You are forgiving and good, O Lord,  abounding in love to all who call to you.  6 Hear my prayer, O LORD ;  listen to my cry for mercy.  7 In the day of my trouble I will call to you,  for you will answer me.  8 Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord;  no deeds can compare with yours.  9 All the nations you have made  will come and worship before you, O Lord;  they will bring glory to your name.  10 For you are great and do marvelous deeds;  you alone are God.  11 Teach me your way, O LORD ,  and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart,  that I may fear your name.  12 I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart;  I will glorify your name forever.  13 For great is your love toward me;  you have delivered me from the depths of the grave.  14 The arrogant are attacking me, O God;  a band of ruthless men seeks my life-  men without regard for you.  15 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,  slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.  16 Turn to me and have mercy on me;  grant your strength to your servant  and save the son of your maidservant.   17 Give me a sign of your goodness,  that my enemies may see it and be put to shame,  for you, O LORD , have helped me and comforted me.

      hey yall. im samantha. i really hope lindsay doesnt kill me for this but i was soo bored and so i thought id add a happy note to the blog because i was reading it and she hasnt added anything since Billys random outburst thingy! last night lindsay and addison and his UGLY friend michael and i watched movies at lindsays house. we were supossed to go see one but i thought i was going to be late and addison and his friend were late so we didnt. anyways ...lindsay and i went and rented some movie (i forget the name of it) and we got marble slab! yum! by the way - dont rent that movie - it really wasnt that great but i cant tell you the name of it right now so sorry. oh and when me and lindsay were driving backto her house she asked if i wanted some of her ice cream and i LOVE ice cream so i was like yeah and her waffle cone was already cracked! haha! and so she was holding it together but i was trying to get some ice cream out of it with my spoon and she wasnt looking and i accidentally knocked the cone off where it was cracked so it fell on the ground. (sorry bout that lindsay). ...neways she threw it out the window and the guy in the car next to us looked kinda mad. oh well. neways we got to her house and i met addison and michael (ew). lol addison is cool!  heehee!  but neways michael was NOT so cute. dont date him. unless you having missing teeth and dont mind guys with missing teeth and ACNE! if you do then go for it. he could be nice maybe. i duno. im just shallow like that.  ...ok well i better get off this bc its supossed to be lindsays mind not mine and im the smart one so im making her look smart and i cant do that. lol. neways ...sorry for getting on this without permission lindsay! and i wont EVER EVER do it again... i was just really bored and when you were doing the other ones at my house it looked like sooo much fun so i had to try but im not lazy to make my own and i dont really care to. but it wont ever happen again. carry on... bye SaMaNtHa!

      hey readers. tonight has been a kinda weird night. i havent talked to sunny in a few days. im getting really sad. Billy came out of no where tonight and said he didnt want a relationship with me but im a really great girl. i was like ok? it was kinda weird but ive realized God is real. He does answer prayers. i kinda already knew he did. but i dont know i wanted him to prove to me that he is real. and he is.  i prayed for a peace about sunny and billy and for him to just got ahead and let me know that Billy wasnt for me. and he did that tonight i mean i wasnt expecting it this soon since i just prayed about it last night. im kinda bummed about the whole thing but i knew it was comming, plus its for the best ya never know maybe God will use Billy in my life in another way. i dont know. things are kinda hectic with me right now.  i asked god to send me someone for the time being maybe even the perfect someone. and its kinda strange coz i went out with addison last night and had so much fun. i dont know what to do im kinda lost at the moment. but now i know all i gotta do is pray about it and God will answer my prayers.. rather it be in a month a year a day or 5 minutes. im still trying to figure out the whole saying" some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers" I dont think im at that point of understanding. well readers its been nice letting yall know inside my head. have a good night and God bless. and if you have a problem talk to the big man upstairs he is always listening, and leah.. ill keep robert in my prayers. good night all.

      ok listen. First off i never said your life revolves around me nor have a ithought that or even implied it. know something i am not trying to make my blog becoming. it is my thoughts always has been always will be. and i dont care if you hate me. and you are doing the same thing you are writing all that on your blog but saying you hate it when people do that to you?!? who do i think i am?! that has NOTHING to do with anything. i dont like to be threatend. you've been a good friend of mine for awhile. and i dont talk to alot of people anymore because i dont get online to chat normally i have a purpose or im bored and dont wan to talk to anyone. i dont talk to you about my problems and what not. and about the movie. you stated in your blog "but most likely it will never be finished" so dont even try to lie about that. i did suck it up and move on thank you very much. how do i lie to you? tell me once when i have lied to you and been a crappy friend. and writing my thoughts on the blog isnt talking behind your back. when you talk behind someones back you dont want them to know . if i wanted to talk behind ytour back i wouldnt have posted it on a PUBLIC BLOG. and since when did i not have a soul? you make no sense what so ever davis.

      hey readers. well i have a few things to say. First off, i HATE it when people claim something that isnt theirs. For instance, i came up with the idea to make a scary movie and i decided to let one of my good friends co-direct it but in his blog he claimed the movie as his. he wouldnt have even known about it if it wasnt for me. and another thing is that i hate it when people say that it is their blog and they put what they want but then ask for people to give suggestions on what to put, it makes no sense. and the guy who does that knows who he is. i have the right mind to not even let him be in my movie now. and then he says he doubts the movie will ev en get finished. that makes me very very mad, ive worked hard on the script. but he is no longer my co-director, i can do it without him. but another thing that is bothering me is my family and some adults i know. i met a guy at world changers , and my parents have discouarged me about him. everyone keeps saying that he is too old and all these other mean things and they dont even know him. he is a great guy and an awesome christian. He means alot to me and helped me when i needed him. no one knows anything about him. they weren't at world changers they dont know . Billy is great, and i wish my parents wouldnt judge him before they meet him. they say never judge someone before you get to know them but thats exactly what they are doing. and another friend of the family has been rude about it. no one understands and im kinda struggling coz eveyrone i met at world changers understood me. my parents dont know. i just wish that i could be back with the same group of people. i wish billy was closer. i told my parents that he means alot ot me and they were just like you dont know what he means to know and blah blah. and i told my sister about him hoping she would understand but she just said he only wanted me for one thing. and i know that Billy isnt like that. we talked about all that and he is nt like that at all it just makes me really mad. but i am going to play B.S. now i need to concentrate on happiness right now and be glad that i have billy ryan sunny jr and jameson as friends. and glad that i always have my best friend to listen to me when im sad and what not , she rocks. I LOVE U SAMANTHA! ... but anyways good night reeaders.  Lindsay 10:46 pm  July 6th 2003

      hey readers ! you know what i just noticed? i left out valentines day details!!!! silly me!! it was exciting! went to olive garden to eat and then back to my house ! the rest was just a blur ! ;-) haha! well anyways back to today - ive been sick all week! ive been home for the past two days! aww poor me! Josh got hit by a car monday.. literally..aww poor him! - nothing too great has happened -ive gone through alot of drama though.. and i mean ALOT...well i offically have two friends at UMS ( my school ). ok heres the drama try to keep up... Ashton ( bffae? or so i thought) was talking about me last wens. when i wasnt at school ( i decided to skip ) well i found out Thursday that she was talking about me the previous day ( wens. ) i was going to approach her but she wasnt at school thurs or friday- my theory is that she ran scared - well monday rolls around and she didnt speak ONE WORD to me ( i thought she was my best friend?) so iwas like whatever screw her - but she CONTINUED to talk about me - so i missed tues and i came to school part of today for like two classes ( American History and Art ) well i get to school to see Samantha my old best friend laughing with ashton my now old best friend - but the ironic thing is that Ashton talked about samantha ALL year long! i just dont get it , ashton also talked about megan lauren kate and celine all year long and now that she doesnt have me she is friends with them ( its fourth quarter now ) i dont understand ( i dont blame you if you dont either ) i suppose they will all turn against me ( whopee) i decided to leave after Art ( 11:45) because i couldnt handle all this with their bull shat and me being deathly ill ( sarcasim ). i dont want to go back tomorrow - i still have corinne and clay - theyve never left me or talked about me or hated me or lied to me  and ive been friends with corinne since 6th grade and clay since 7th - i owe alot to them  - its not everyday you;ll find friends like them - id rather have two great friends than a bunch of fake friends i leave for college in August of 2005 a bout a year and 5 months away - and after that i wont care about the petty worries of high school i wont talk to tose friends ever again - except for Corinne and Clay - its grim reality- if your still reading and some what following me ( congrats ) then i guess i seem like im handling it ok - but im not - im honestly hurt - i may only have a year and 5 months left but id like to have friends during that year and 5 months - when you get backstabbed and betrayed it hurts - and i think it hurts the backstabber and betrayer too - thanks for listening/reading  lots o love    Lindsay
