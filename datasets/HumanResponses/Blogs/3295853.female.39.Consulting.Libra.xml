      Everything is energy and beyond that is Supreme Intelligence".  Albert Einstein    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Energy is within and around every living thing or otherwise: people, animals, plants, rocks, sound, waves of light – our world. This is the key to using energy as a therapy and Practitioners of Bio-Energy learn to detect breaks or blockages so that they can redirect the flow of energy to assist the body’s own powerful healing mechanism. Bio-Energy (meaning life force and referring to the energy around the human body) originated in China 5,000 years ago, and is based on rebalancing the body’s natural energy fields and clearing blockages that stagnate to cause illness.   As this ambient energy is drawn into the body, it flows through energy centres called chakras and along pathways called meridians and, as well as surrounding our physical bodies in an electro-magnetic field or aura. The energetic field surrounding the body has been photographed using Kirlian photography. (Images ex www.kirlian.org).  Working with energy may be an unfamiliar idea to most Westerners, as society knows all about illness but very little about health. The latter is multi-dimensional – it’s about how we function as human beings in every aspect; physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. When one learns to work with it, energy can prove an incredibly powerful healer of our minds, bodies and spirits. Exchange of energy at such a deep level has a profoundly relaxing effect on the recipient, enabling the release of physical and emotional traumas, old patterns and blockages. In this way, Bio-Energy therapy can tackle and release the deeply rooted causes of many problems that have become hidden or forgotten. I find this to be true whether the recipient is human or equine.   On a physical level, when there is an imbalance of energy the body adapts either by altering its physical way of moving or mental behaviour. Healing with energy serves to stimulate and speed up the body’s own natural healing process by changing the brainwaves of the recipient into a low-amplitude alpha state of calmness and relaxation (research Tsuda (Japan) thereby increasing blood flow making oxygen more available to the tissues and cells, and thus allowing the healing of injuries or illness.  There is a vast body of research (especially Stanford, Harvard and Maryland Universities) being made into energy, with an increasing number of American doctors now being trained in Energy Medicine. Even modern physicists no longer see matter as matter, but rather as a density of energy, with the whole world composed of different patterns or vibrational frequencies of energy.

      For generations, the mechanics of modern life have been such that we have had to adapt to an unnatural and abused way of living. With depression and stress related illnesses at an all time high, the effects of stress are taking a grave toll on our health.  On a physical level, our bodies depend on the harmony of all the complex energy patterns that go to make up the human body. This balance is most delicately poised and can be disorganized by sustained levels of stress, toxins, viruses, and negative emotions, should it be diverted from its proper behaviour disharmony or illness follows.  Whatever happens within the physical or emotional body is reflected in its electromagnetic or energy field (aura) and can be clearly seen as an imbalance when photographed using Kirlian photography. This tells us that the flow of vital life force energy is adversely affected by mental, emotional and physical stresses and unless rectified that individual can never be truly healthy.  As a Plexus Bio-Energy practitioner I became very interested in the way the body and its energy field stores stress, emotional issues and even physical trauma. I discovered that, as my hands would sweep over a patient’s energy field I would often locate the seat of an old injury even though this injury may have happened when the patient was a child and did not cause any conscious concern to the patient. What intrigued me was that this information was still stored in the cellular memory of the physical body, and more seriously that it manifested itself within the energy field as a blockage or disturbance to the natural flow of energy. I realised that until cleared, the energy field has no way of releasing or transforming these cellular memories of injuries or negative emotions.   I began to realise that the body’s system for storing information within the energy field was a vital key to the cause of many deep rooted illnesses. I became fascinated in what I call Body-Wisdom. By using a combination of intuition and Bio-Energy I found that I could locate blockages and interpret the significance or symbolism of location of the blockage, for instance the hips might represent support, left is the receiving side, right is the directional side etc), this interpretation would guide the patient directly back to the ‘cause’ of the problem.. Once we were at the energetic ‘cause’ it was astonishing to see the deep cellular memory clearing. By working with the purity and intelligence of the body-mind dynamic we were able to clear and release the blockages of some very deep issues and a profound and often fascinating ‘self-healing’ would occur.   My introduction to the existence of the body’s energy field came about some time after I was diagnosed with the debilitating autoimmune disease, Lupus. Being told I had an incurable and potentially fatal disease had the unsurprising effect of galvanising me into some sort of action! Initially it was a sheer panic type of action, and then a wiser sense started to kick in that says simply ‘slow down’. Therefore, to begin with I found I oscillated violently between these two extremes, with no particular form of control or knowledge on how to handle myself or the situation.   On good days I think I read just about every book on the subject of mind, body and spirit. Determined I set about my own research trying different relaxation techniques, visualisations and meditations. The proof of their efficacy would be if I was able to feel physically better and mentally calmer. I soon began to realise that some of these techniques helped me more than others; I was starting to feel more grounded and centred. Most importantly, when you are told you have an incurable disease, is not to let the apparent ‘hopelessness’ of the situation overtake you; it is vital to be self-empowered– this aspect alone can, I have discovered, make the difference between an illness ruling your life or not. The more I explored, studied and practiced the more I became aware and then finally convinced, that it was time to revaluate not just what was happening in my body or in my life, but I had to search for an answer in a wider context – I had to find a way to integrate mind, body and spirit.  Almost as if in an answer to a prayer I picked up an article about ‘Plexus Bio-Energy’, which described how bio-energy therapy draws on ancient Chinese techniques for balancing the mind, body, spirit dynamic and how this technique is used to rebalance and heal the body. This was my cue and I immediately booked up for treatment and then went on to train in Energy Medicine. Intuitively, I knew that this was the missing link in my search; by unblocking the body’s energy field coupled with specific meditations and visualisations, I knew I had found the vital key in reclaiming my own health on a profound level.   If we were to realise that any pain or illness we suffer is our body’s way of trying to get us to ‘come back home’, to get more in tune with ourselves, we will find that we can view these events in a different light and realise that it is in fact a wonderful opportunity to evolve. We are our own greatest friend and ally and by relearning our own Body-Wisdom we can join forces within ourselves again, to begin a journey and reclaim our own exquisite potential.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Bio-Energy can guide you back into your body, to realise the vast and powerful resources that have been waiting for you to find your way home.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  For all our internal "hard-wiring" and thousands of homeostatic mechanisms, we can change our skills, acquire new ones.. that is the ultimate glory of being a human being.  Deepak Chopra    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Bio-Energy Therapy benefits a wide range of physical health problems from minor issues to major disease. The benefits of Bio-Energy arise from a physical and energetic ability to achieve inner body equilibrium, vitality, self awareness and mental tranquillity.

      The Treatment is carried out in four sessions on four consecutive days with each session lasting approximately 30 - 40 minutes. A period of four to six weeks is usually allowed between any subsequent Treatments to allow the healing process to take effect.  During each session the energy field is scanned with the hands, locating and rebalancing any blockages or depletions that are found. Using a series of unique hand movements the field is rebalanced and the natural healing ability is able to be unlocked. During this time, some individuals may experience feelings of heat, cold, tingling or even a gentle pulling sensation.  A crucial aspect of Bio-Energy Therapy is the involvement of the individual. Each person will be advised on aspects of diet, exercise, meditation and breathing techniques. By taking an active part in their recovery programme in this way, the individual is able to regain a sense of power and begin a journey of self discovery which will significantly assist the healing process.
