       for jasmine  ::  "And I'm learning too About the way that people do The things that they do Never meaning to hurt anyone But we all do things we regret And wish we'd never done Oh child, and there you are Wandering through the garden of life Picking up flowers and eating them And the world will smile when you smile And we all have smiles inside of us"     duvet  ::  "And you don't seem to understand A shame you seemed an honest man And all the fears you hold so dear Will turn to whisper in your ear And you know what they say might hurt you And you know that it means so much And you don't even feel a thing"     elephant  ::   "If I was to hold one hand over my face now Would you know me? Or would you see the other side of me? And if you were to notice There is a plan I've been devising To go, to go now, far away from here And I gonna be so brave And I gonna go so far away"     fool  ::   "You and I, born as fools now You and I think, think we rule now"     one day  ::  "I won't be happy till you're out the door You won't be happy till you get some more You need me You love me, you love me"       After I put some more...

       * Bad grades...   * I can't hang out with my friends x.x  A new music to my winamp list(and maybe a  new  band..),it's loah and pero²'s fault.   Talking Heads - Phsyco Killer     " I can't seem to face up to the facts I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax I can't sleep 'cause my bed's on fire Don't touch me I'm a real live wire   * Psycho Killer Qu'est-ce que c'est? Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far far better  Run run run run run run run away Psycho Killer Qu'est-ce que c'est? Fa fa fa fa fa fa fa fa far far better Run run run run run run run away  You start a conversation you can't even finish it. You're talkin' a lot, but you're not sayin' anything. When I have nothing to say, my lips are sealed. Say something once, why say it again?   *   Ce que j'ai fait ce soir-Ce qu'elle a dit ce soir-Rlisant mon espoir, Je me lance vers la gloire... Ok  We are vain and we are blind I hate people when they're not polite "     I don't even know what to write... I hate my english, sometimes it just doesn't 'flow'. I think it's my first post in a blog, and definetly  nobody  is reading. Who cares? (I care x.x) I can't even think clearly... I'd like to only put songs, but who would like it? I love music and it's one of the reason's that I'm alive, mainly 'cause Björk(she's my favourite singer *.*).  I love to talk about Björk and sing her songs. But I can talk about other singers( or bands), like: Polly Jean Harvey(well known as PJ Harvey), Fiona Apple, Tori Amos, Garbage, Ambeon, Marilyn Manson, I can't remember anybody else right now. I can't define a unique 'musical preference', but I can say i really like trip-hop and this kind of stuff. I have never thought it was so hard to write in a blog, maybe it isn't...possibly maybe. I wanna send a letter to a friend in Argentina than I plan to send her the  letter i've written, but I always forget to go to the Post Office(after I talk about her)... I'm out oftime... my mother isn't at home, and I think I'll try to "flee" a bit(am I correct?)  Ja ne o/ (i forgot to say, I study japanese, and 'ja ne' means 'bye' \o.o/) Cya ;T~
