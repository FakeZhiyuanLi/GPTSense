      Â 	 2day really a big struggling day... Cos of something i done wrong i get scolded by a sister in Christ... After I get scolded, i tel myself "its was my wrong to play so don like tat, smile!" But i still can't get through the struggle... After a few mins, my mind became very confused and my heart was very empty. Who knos the more i struggle, the more confused in my mind... I felt like being a mad person, but i tel myself not to GIVE UP... If i give up, the Evil will win the battle. When these kind of things happen, i will need a quiet place or enviroment to hav a clear mind so tat i can fight the battle... Ppl who donno me well, might think tat i'm a mad person or wat. All these things has blocked me from serving God, doin things properly and its oso make me cannot concentrate on thinking things... I wish i could find a cure for tis kind of strange illness...

I, myself can tel tat i hav changed alot even some broths and sis R saying it but i myself kno tat wat i had done is very NOT enough... I MUST continue to change in the gd way... 2day after hearing Wei Kit's sharing i found tat i like nv care or get to kno more abt my brothes and sisters i keep saying i'm a failure... But i really thank's God for all his forgiveness, even though i had done so many bad  things God still forgive me and let me stand up again... Thank's God! Tis verse is for all the sad and moody ppl - 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18  16 Be joyful always; 17 pray continually; 18 give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.

      Got one blog i share wif U all is a kind of strange illness i'm having rite? 2day i share it wif my mummy "Li Qin"... She say tat i do things by feeling, so she gave me a suggestion to cure it... The suggestion is to use my mind to think when these things come and try to think of wat i should be doing and not those stupid things... For no reason i feel very sad, moody and negative so she told me to ask myself tis ques "why for NO REASON i become like tat?"... So if U ppl wanna help me when i very emotional, sad, moody and negative, pls remind me by asking "why for NO REASON U become like tat?" Then after i talked to my mummy "Li Qin", i told myself "WOW, i learned a new thing!"... And i told mysely " nth can stop God / me fr doin gd" then my mummy say "Jia You"... Tis is a very gd experience!

      Tis is the first time i go a church co-worker camp... Before we go to the camp, my Mummy "Li Qin" already not feeling well but she still go to the camp...    The first day i go, i already know tat it is somehow like a meeting camp... We discussed abt how to improve ur church and how to get into serious work in church... I really learned many things from tis camp but too bad i'm a slow-absorb and slow in thinking person so many things still need time to learn and change...   Slowly i know i don hav a "jie-na" heart, a loving heart, a caring heart  and an understanding heart for my broths and sis in Christ... I always think tat i need ppl to encourage, to talk to and to care. But its other broths and sis in Christ need it not me, i should not to be a baby christian and learn to be a gd co-worker in church...  But these all changes has to take alots of time... I really feel sorry for everyone in church especially mummy "Li Qin", i always give them trouble and always act like i very pity... On the second day of our camp, a broth suddenly can't breath properly and being send to hospital... We the youth acutally pray hard for him, i was thinking of pray for the whole nite but mummy "Li Qin" ask "wat if 2mor U don hav the energy?" She is rite, so i only prayed for 4 hrs tat day but i only sleep 1 hr...  In tis camp i really learned tat i'm not serious enough for church things lorz! So there is really many things for me to change... haha! Think back, God really gave me alots of chance for me to change lorz! Really thank's God for all the things tat he has given me.
