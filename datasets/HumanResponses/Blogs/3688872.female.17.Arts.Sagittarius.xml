       urlLink CHP Election Campaign Site   check if there's a candidate running in your area and find out about them!!! even if you can't vote---at least find out about them....talk about this to your parents, etc....an interesting option.  don't know yet whether we can agree with everything they run for, but worth looking at, i believe.  so, take the time to read

        Yes, it's probably breaking the page because it's full size and you 56kers probably hate me.  BB4Win Minimal theme, Gentoo Linux wallpaper (because I'm in the process of making this a Gentoo box), no icons, Y'z Dock on bottom, Winamp, you can see that I'm listening to Hillsongs' To the Ends of the Earth CD.

      while work does afford more anecdotal funnies, it also carries some  measure of fatigue, in which blogging becomes rather difficult.      what compounds this difficulty with this long, obscure french url is  that it doesn't really have a theme. so i suggest we come up with some  manner of blogging form. is it about personal stuff (no)? is it about  funny things you found on the internet? can we make this place into a  newspaper of sorts, each contributor writing a column on the topic of  his or her choice? or maybe a mad chain story. those seem hilarious.

NO: Pierson (crappy freshmen dorms-same one as Saybrook, nice architecture, newly renovated) Jonathan Edwards (i don't know anything about this one...gothic architecture probably) NO: Silliman (nice, but still unrenovated, has a rock climbing wall, not old campus) NO: Timothy Dwight (renovated, closer to science hill, not old campus) NO: Davenport (PRINCESS freshmen suites, swing space in 2nd year though) NO: Berkeley (lovely freshmen dorms, good food) NO: Calhoun (close to main parts of campus, good dorms all around)  Trumbull/JE???

      throw off the selfish ambition. throw off the self-centred perspective. decrease the importance of pleasure and wealth.  to be a servant of God is to be a servant of all.  DO GOOD.  that is a worthy motto. just because salvation is through faith not actions, does not mean that actions are not important. they are vital.   Do good and bring Christ to everyone you meet.

      jacquie -- hehe you're not the only one who likes to blog. don't we all :P.   i've finally been reading les miserables, and it is beautifully written, deep, insightful, poignant, and just a wonderful reading experience. it is poignant because we can recognize that human tragedy is, sadly, quite commonplace, largely due to the fact that good and evil do not necesarily receive their just desserts. however, the part i loved the most was the portrayal of the spiritual struggle of the soul, reaching for the unseen God yet torn by the world and its condamnations.

      i just got their cd from mitchells yesterday!!! the songs are good :), very hip-hoppy, but the girls can sing. and the lyrics are both godly and down-to-earth compassionate.   from one song...  the request of the maker/of the ocean and the sky so blue/it's a call for some soldiers/so if you're not afraid to take a stand/then let me see you raise your hand  from another...  why is that smile upon you're face/when it's such a rainy day/why are so happy/what do you know that i don't know/i wish i did but ain't been told/so tell me what's your secret  and from yet another...  didn't have to come and save my life/didn't have to pay the price for me/ sincerely, i'm not worthy / [...] i can't believe you've chosen to reveal/never ending mercy towards a heart that's been so faithless/the fact that you want to show yourself to me  God's grace&nbsp;amazes me. It is truly grace. He is truly love. Like the Bible says, it gives me "unspeakable joy". And I know, like David, that the Lord is my refuge, strength, horn of my salvation. Everything possible only through the grace of God.  Sincerely, I'm not worthy.     &nbsp; Something i remember from the passion play in nashville, is that I myself was responsible for killing Jesus. But He still died for me with love, to save me from hell, to give me life to the fullest, to find me, a lost one, and never abandon me, loving me for eternity.   Listening to Christian music is wonderful :).

      since i've been back from nashville, summer has been fun and lazy. going to marineland, ottawa, aletheia, church, shopping. but this part of summer seems like a lead in to the china missions trip. going on 2 missions trips a summer is a lot...physically, it's ok, emotionally, it's fine, but spiritually, it's both draining and AMAZING.  amazing  because on missions trips, you get to see the work of God, and do the work of God, and experience our Lord, growing closer to His heart (see another blog entry).  draining  because satan hates God and his kingdom, and if you choose to follow God's will, be a frontline soldier, satan WILL attack you with doubts and discouragement. ALL LIES. satan is the king of lies (doesn't even create anything new...just destroys life).  amazing once again  because even though satan can appeal to flesh, we, as christians, live in the Spirit, which sets us free from sin and the law. we are of the Spirit, while still in flesh. so during the times of attack, it is more imperant (is that a word??) to die to the self, and to flesh, and be alive in the Spirit and in Christ. I've realized that, in my relationship with God, all I really did was to choose my side. I chose God ten years ago. from that decision of trust in God, faith and understanding of God was through the Holy Spirit, not from my own understanding. today, my relationship in and understanding of God is possible only THROUGH the Holy Spirit. by myself, i am lost. with the Spirit, I truly and firmly&nbsp;belong to God. my parents have been telling me, when attacks come, to just float. float and let the power of the Holy Spirit work. in fact, even without attacks, we should be relying completely on God.&nbsp;in Christ there is no condemnation, and nothing can separate us from the love of God.   if you've read this blog and you care and you trust in Jesus, my request is that you pray for me...and give me your prayer requests!!! prayer is of the essence :).   back to the world, my suite at yale next year is a DECTET..i was so surprised that they even existed, but pleasantly surprised. i'm in the double marked below. it's BIG.

      Psalm 138:1-8  1 I give thee thanks, O LORD, with my whole heart; before the gods I sing thy praise; 2 I bow down toward thy holy temple and give thanks to thy name for thy steadfast love and thy&nbsp; faithfulness;&nbsp; for thou hast exalted above everything thy name and thy word. 3 On the day I called, thou didst answer me, my strength of soul thou didst increase. 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, for they have heard the words of thy mouth; 5 and they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, for great is the glory of the LORD. 6 For though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly; but the haughty he knows from afar. 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou dost preserve my life;&nbsp; thou dost&nbsp; stretch out thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand delivers me. 8 The LORD will fulfil his purpose for me; thy steadfast love, O LORD, endures for ever.&nbsp; Do not forsake the work of thy hands.

      When you accept Him, from that moment, unless you yourself choose to deny Him, He will remain your Father, best Friend, King, Saviour, Counselor, and the list goes on, forever. I LOVE Him. And His faithfulness astounds me.   I'm going to write my STM testimony tonight.  On another note, I got my yale email account up and running:  janice.wong@yale.edu . There are only 3 Janices at Yale :) and I'm the first Janice Wong ever :) :) :). The facebook (like friendster but for colleges) is also fun to play with.

      today was really cool, beginning my day with reading something from Luke (Jesus' teachings though taught so long ago are still revolutionary right now). then, I DROOOOOVVEEE to harknett music store up in markham to pick up my red plush toy lobster that was removed when my flute got fixed. they held the lobster since april. ha. after that my mom drove (to get haircut and eat spaghetti).   "be cute" refers to our trip to shoppers drug mart. i wanted eyeliner, eye makeup remover and possibly different eyeshadow colours. so, i asked this asian lady who worked at shoppers for some advice. she's like "you're so cute!" and gave me, in addition to advice, a small bottle of acne treatment cream (ahem, nashville heat), face wash and sample lipstick/gloss. for free!!!! everything for $27, which was good, considering that the eyeliner pencil had 2 different colours and the eyeshadow box had 10-12 different colours.   i drove more after, and almost hit someone. thank God it didn't happen.

      i just had the most amazing quiet time in my backyard with God, and He affirmed so much (doubts just try to pull you away from God, away from the life He promises), and guided me on how to make the change brought by the missions trip become a real change in the 'real world'. stick with Him -- it's worth it and it's what you're supposed to do!!!!! God is the real McCoy. And what's more, God created Mr. McCoy. To worship Him is my purpose, and it's what i want to do.

      are solely for the edification of the Church. It never tears down relationships, but rather, draws people closer to each other and to God. The purpose of everyone's life is to know God and worship Him, and gifts are tools given from God to achieve that purpose. Oh Lord, teach me how to discern your gifts and your voice, protect me - I have to continue walking close to You, submitting to Your guidance through your word and the Holy Spirit.   The visions during the STM, after looking at the context, the result and their correlation with God's word, were definitely from God, and I praise Him for making Himself known in such a powerful way. However, during the trip, we were backed up by the church with prayer and months of preparation. What about "normal life"? I don't want to jump into or jump out of having "visions". To jump out may be to suppress a wonderful gift from God to build up His kingdom, which is irresponsible. To jump in may be dangerous because if I focus too much on the gift itself, I may be allowing eventually visions from the devil to enter - it is vital that I keep a close relationship with God and be sure that visions are purely from the Holy Spirit. This must be taken slowly, carefully, wisely and prayerfully. An important question also is how to use this spiritual gift in ministry in the church or fellowship? Pray for discernment and wisdom.  On a completely different note, I would love to see spiderman 2 with you guys soon! Tuesdaaaaay?????

      God is so faithful. I first believed in Him when I was 7, but only after many years did I start to really appreciate (this word is too weak, really) the salvation given to me through Jesus' death and resurrection. But according to John 3:16, whoever believes in Jesus will have eternal life. So from the moment of belief, even if I didn't fully understand all that salvation entailed, God had already written my name in the book of life and welcomed me into His kingdom. From there, my salvation was worked out through His grace. But no matter how much I understood, God was holding me already in His arms, and He still is! Now that He has given me more wisdom and maturity as a Christian (although He still has much to work on with me), I can't help but worship God with all my life.   During a worship session in Nashville, God gave me the following vision: the 7 of us sitting together singing songs to God were represented by clear, pure diamonds. We were washed with light from above, and reflected/refracted back that light in brilliant colours. I think God gave me that vision to illustrate an important point of worship. When we are pure (through the blood of Jesus) like the diamonds, we must choose to surrender, to place ourselves in the light of God. The act of surrender leads to worship, as we revel in the glory of God, and reflect back his glory. Although we do not affect the brightness or glory of God, in giving back his glory, God is pleased, just as one is pleased with the scintillation of a diamond.   I don't have the gift of interpretation, I think, so if you do, enlighten me :).

      I was reading your blog entry about your missions trip to Atlanta, and I was so happy to hear of how God has changed you for life and how He gave you the freedom to live a life of worship. I knew something had changed about you when I saw you (cause God showed me), and we have to be accountability partners for these types of things. We're sisters in Christ, and can you just imagine how it will be like when we finally meet God face to face??? I think that He'll be more powerful than we could imagine here on earth, and when we see Him, it would certainly take us all of eternity to worship Him, love Him, and give glory to Him. On earth we see but a glimpse and are filled with awe and love. In heaven, we will see God in full, and the awe and love we expressed on earth will seem like merely a shadow. I really want to encourage you to hold on to that life of worship, and we'll do it together. love you :)

      The following is only an outline of my story; you should hear all the others...your ears would just pop.   In the past 10 days, I have grown more in Christ than I have in the past 2 years. From the first day, I began to hear God's voice during quiet times and throughout the entire day. Then, on the night of the passion play, the re-enactment of the death of Jesus, I broke down before God and He imprinted onto me a lesson that he had taught me a few months before - the purpose of my life is to prepare myself for heaven, love God, worship God and win others to God, not to run after meaningless accomplishments. The next evening, we had a time to listen to God's call for missions. God clearly spoke to me. I know when I hear God's voice, which bypasses vocal chords, when two criteria are fulfilled. First, that the message agrees with what is written in the Bible, the word of God. Second, that the Holy Spirits moves within me to agree with the message. God told me that He had chosen me to be at Yale for Him, to evangelise, to be a light on campus, and to win Yalies to Christ. He also told me not to drink until it is lawful to do so by law, and even then, it must be with restraint. God assured me that Yale was His choice. Because of that, I'm not scared of going, and I'm not scared of being a fire on campus for Christ, not with the God of everything with me and before me. He also told me that my love for science or academics will play an important part in missions, and perhaps I can heal people both spiritually and physically. Finally, I felt a clear call from Him to go to Germany, and build vibrant churches. Celeste prayed for me that night, and I am reminded of the commitment by a cross that was given to me.   At the Foundry, we jumped (took the plunge!) into urgent outreach and ministry, and serious, passionate worship. The first evening at the Foundry, we had a session of prophetics worship - that is, worship led by none other than the Holy Spirit. We sung new songs to God based on scripture, we danced, we did whatever the Spirit moved us to do. I felt FREEDOM. Freedom to worship God, to be free from all worldly restraints - sin, concerns, human judgements. It was purely between me and God. I felt drawn into His presence, close and intimate. You could do anything to worship God. Through the fellowship from Florida, we learned true fellowship and worship that night. The Foundry staff were totally led by the Holy Spirit. We experienced prophecies (all the time for all of us) and speaking in tongues (Sharon heard it during pre-worship prayer) from the staff members. Prophecy is hearing God, and telling others what He said. We took part in prophetic art, and in making prophecies. For the first time, I realized that I was supposed to be desiring the spiritual gifts of prophecy and vision, and desiring the complete control of the Holy Spirit. I prayed to God for the gifts of prophecy and vision, and surrendered to the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Ask and it shall be given unto you. From that moment, God revealed to me a spiritual gift that had been granted to me to worship Him: the gift of vision. I began to have visions from God during worship, fellowship and evangelism. Each vision either revealed to me something about my relationship with God or something about the person I was ministering to, especially about their spiritual life or God's purpose for them. God gives me visions usually based on nature, but some are more abstract and some are more real. When I let the Holy Spirit take control, God began to show more and more of His power to change my life and the lives of others. Other spiritual gifts that I may have are the gifts of joy and of communication. The latter I found out about when I shared my testimony during Saturday night live. I felt that it was God who moved people, and definitely not my own efforts - in fact, I was mostly reading off my journal. God has his ways though.   On this trip, we also saw that he worked through jokes - God enjoys good humour. For example, Pastor Andy was explaining in the van what a false prophecy would feel like by saying, "say I told you, Janice, that I saw you ministering on the streets of Berlin", meaning to show how the Spirit did not move in me. However, the Spirit DID move in me, and we realized that Pastor Andy had probably prophesized without even knowing it! (Note: jokes as prophecies have also worked with sam/cham, especially combined with non-joke prophecies.) During the prophecy session, there were 4 prophecies about me, and I will expand later, but the basic idea is that I'll be stepping out somewhere that not many people would normally go and that my life will not at all be average. The best part was that half the prophecies were given by people I have never spoken to. As God's plan for my life starts to unfold, I see the reason for my personality and skills - why I'm academic, why I have a heart for the German people, why I'm adventurous...and the list goes on.   God's heart, plan, gifts and blessings have been revealed to me. In response, I WANT to live my life preparing for eternity with this loving, amazing God. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life. I must live like Jesus, and to bring others to Jesus, who is the only one who can give a life of abundance.
