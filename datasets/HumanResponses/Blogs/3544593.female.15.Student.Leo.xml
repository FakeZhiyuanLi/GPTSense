      This was done 4 an essay lesson i had....take a look if u want... its nothing much... just some assingment our teacher made us do....  Sitting in my bedroom, staring at photos of dad and me brought so many fond memories of the priceless moments we had together. I wonder how he was doing. He’s probably preparing for his wedding now. I couldn’t blame him for finding a new wife. He had to move on with his life anyways. I haven’t seen him for nine years now. Haven’t spoken to him either. If it weren’t for mum telling me that dad was getting re-married I wouldn’t have known. Why did it have to be like this? Most of the time, I find myself wishing that I could go back 9 years to the past and change it. 	Not to say I’m living a miserable life. Sure my step dad treats me as though I was his own blood. I know he is trying his very best but he could never be able to replace dad. I’m slowly learning to accept him. Accept fate is what everyone keeps telling me. I use to hate him a lot. But now, things are looking up and maybe one day, I’ll be able to accept my mum and dad’s divorce. 	I wish I could go back to the States to see my dad. Of course if I wanted to go to the states to see my friends, I would have been given a ride on my step dad’s personal jet. But when I ask to see my dad, my mum will start a fuss. I wasn’t allowed to see dad and dad wasn’t allowed to see me not until I’m 21 years old. I was born into a rich family. My mum was from an elite family while my dad was a famous doctor. I was given everything I wanted. My grandfather loved my mum dearly. He pampered her. And when he passed away, he left all his inheritance to my mum. Sure, being in a rich family was great until 9 years ago. 	Everything I asked my mum to buy, I would have gotten it. But, she was strict. She always made sure I was perfect in everything I did. I had to learn how to greet well, dress well, dance well, stand well, walk well, talk well, everything I did had to be perfect. She was a perfectionist. My mum was not an easy woman to please. Sometimes she demanded a lot. Things were always done according to her ways. The only place I felt relaxed and unstressed was with dad. He wasn’t demanding nor was he always pressuring me to do well. He accepted me as me. 	Sure dad always gave in to mum. He loved her dearly. I was always their baby even though mum was such a perfectionist. I understand pretty well that it was all because she doesn’t want the family name to be damaged. She was always there for me when I needed support and comfort. Mum, dad and I would spend lots of time together under our favorite spot under the big oak tree in our garden. We would laugh talk and cry there. We even named the tree our “True Confessions.” Because we would confess our love for each other, our disappointments and knowledge all under that tree.          I’m not sure what happened between mum and dad after a few years. They started quarrelling a lot. Sometimes mum would be throwing things out the room, or she’ll be crying non-stop. At other times dad would go out and only return the next morning only to be greeted by an angry wife demanding where he has been. Whenever I ask them about it they would only say everything’s fine and give me a hug. We seldom sit under “True Confessions” and hardly have our family time anymore. Inside me, I felt that something wasn’t right.  	It didn’t get any better day-to-day. Dad who was always patient with mum started shouting and scolding mum who would end up shouting back and crying. It wasn’t very long before dad hardly returned home and mum would start calling his office or hand phone only to be frustrated when her calls were answered by the answering machine. 	Soon they were both in the lawyers’ office filling up the divorce papers. Both of them looked gloomy and heartbroken. I knew what was happening. To me this meant that all those times we had together would be just a memory. It could never be relived. It hurt a lot when I had became the center of attention. Even after the divorce they still fought whenever they saw each other. Soon mum was dating someone else while I continued living with mum and dad every different week. I had two homes.  I didn’t like mum’s new boyfriend and I hated the fact that she could just forget about dad and think this new man could replace him. 	Mum soon remarried and was planning to migrate to England. This brought up another fight between mum and dad. Mum wanted me to follow her to England while dad wanted me to stay with him in the States. I felt so sick and tired when all they did was quarrel. They soon decided to take this to court where the tough battle was won by mum. Mum had full custody of me and dad wasn’t allowed to visit me or be anywhere near me until I was 21 years old. An adult. I could only see my dad when I was an adult! The best days of my childhood would be spent without my dad.  	I cried when I realized what happened. I didn’t want to be separated from my dad. I wanted him near me.  I couldn’t bear any of these conditions/ I was so angry with mum for separating dad and me. I felt so bitter that the judge would allow this. I was so frustrated that I didn’t have any say in these things. I was brought home to get my things.  2 months later, we were sitting at the airport waiting for our jet to come. I noticed a tall figure came up to the door of the hangar. I looked up and saw it was dad. Mum quickly went over to dad her face all sour. Dad asked if he could see me for the last time. Mum hesitated but gave in. I ran to dad and jumped into his strong arms. Memories of those happy time flooded back. He held me closer. I couldn’t hold back my tears any longer. Dad looked at me and wiped my tear-streaked face. He said he was sorry for all this and told me to be a good girl and obey mum. He also said that he will always be in my heart and that I would always be his little girl. Tears welled up in his eyes. Before I knew it we were both hugging and crying. He hugged me tighter until mum came over to tell us that we were leaving. Dad kissed my check and gave me a last cuddle. Mum took my hand and had to drag me into the plane. I released mum’s hand and ran back to dad giving him a last hug. Mum came and carried me into the plane. I was screaming and crying. Dad waved at me helplessly. As we pulled out from the airport, I saw dad getting smaller and smaller. He blew a kiss at me I waved back hoping that all this was just a terrible nightmare. I looked at his disappointed face and that was the last time I saw him. Hopefully in 5 years time I’ll be able to see the charming face of my dad’s again and feel the warmth of his hugs. Until then I promised my self that I would accept fate and make the best out of my life. All the good and the bad times would just have to stay a memory.

      HOW COULD YOU??!!- Ally.  How could you??? I treated you as my friend, Trusted you, got your back, I didn’t know that you are a fiend. I told you everything, My secretes, my hopes, my dreams, But you betrayed me, How could you? I kept your secrets, had faith in you, But you used me, You went against me, You didn’t support me, You didn’t treat me as your friend. I was an idiot, Thinking that you meant everything, Your encouragement, your support, I thought it was the truth, But guess what,  It was just lies.  How could you?? You treated me like dirt all along, You never realized how much I cared for you. Never realized I would go through hell just 2 save your ass, You never realized how much I supported you. How could you?? Forget who your true friends are.  You ruined everything, Not just for yourself, but me. What you did, Really hurt. It sliced my heart, my everything. Maybe I was wrong all along. I was wrong about everything.  How could you?? You broke that special bond, I shared with you all along, You never realized how much you’re worth. You went so low,  You ruined your life, your hopes and my trust. How could you?? I hope you have a good life, Even though you betrayed me, I wish you the very best with your new friends. But deep in my heart, I still don’t understand How could you!!!!!  I wrote this poem for someone I trusted and cared for. I still can’t believe you went as low as you did!!!! Anyhow, I do honestly wish you all the best and may you live your life to the max. No matter what, I’ll never forget the things you did for me. No matter what you’ll always be my friend. No matter what. Always and forever.

      Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.  -Buddha  One should not lose one's temper unless one is certain of getting more and more angry to the end.  -William Butler Yeats   "No such thing, bad student. Only bad teacher." -Mr. Miagi, The Karate Kid  Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.  -Bill Gates    You can have anything in life you want if you just help enough other people get what they want.  -Zig Ziglar  *I decided to put up a few quotes each day.... i cant make anypromises but i'll try my best.... I hope that these qoutes will come in handy 1 day!!!!!!!!!
