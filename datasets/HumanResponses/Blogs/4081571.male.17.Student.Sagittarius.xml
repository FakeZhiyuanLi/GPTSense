      Give what you have. To some one, it may be better than you dare to think.  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow   Somehow, not only for Christmas But all the long year through The joy that you give to others Is the joy that comes back to you.   John Greenleaf Whittier  Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves.  Sir James Matthew Barrie   Let us think about each other and help each other to show love and do good deeds.   Heb. 10:24  If there are poor among you, in one of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be selfish or greedy toward them. But give freely to them, and freely lend them whatever they need.  Deut. 15:7-8    You will find, as you look back upon your life, that the moments that stand out are the moments when you have done thing for others.    Henry Drummond  Give and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will pour into your lap. For whatever measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt to you in return.  Luke 6:38 NIV     from  Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul

      (Communion is a rite of a Christian church in which bread and wine is served to baptized Christians.)   Of all the rituals and colorful ceremonies that children see performed in church, perhaps the most misunderstood of all is the sacrament of Communion. Seeing the bread and wine (or grape juice) used in this rite, children often think that refreshments are being served.   Attending his first Mass, one small boy listened as the altar boys rang the bells for the consecration, and yelled, "Come and get it!" Whereupon those who were to take Communion went and got it.    A boy of three was intrigued by the Communion rite and watched every move of the priest until he finished by wiping the chalice. Then the boy turned to his mother and said, "He's doing dishes, Mom... now can we go home?"    Kneeling beside his mother at Mass after she returned from taking Communion, a boy asked, "How does that pill taste?" Since she was praying silently to herself, she didn't answer. Then he tried again: "It's the kind of pill that puts you to sleep, huh?"    After doing her best to explain the ceremony to her daughter, a young mother went to the Communion rail. As she returned, the girl asked, "When will it be my turn to eat lunch with God?"    Trying to acquaint her five-year-old son with the ritual of the Mass, a mother gave her boy a picture missal so he could see in front of him what was going on at the altar during Communion. The boy watched as the priest opened the tabernacle, removed the chalice, and drank the wine. Then the boy pointed to the tabernacle in his book and asked, "Is that the little refrigerator where he keeps his drinks?"    While visiting his aunt in Columbus, Mississippi, a second-grader attended the local Methodist Church with her. After they knelt at the altar and partook of the Communion bread and wine, the boy asked, "Aunt Audrey, is that all we'll have to eat up in Heaven?"    A young married couple who were baptized into the First Presbyterian Church in Hollywood brought along their seven-year-old son, Michael, to see the ceremony. His mother explained in advance about baptism, but she had forgotten to explain that Communion would also be offered to the entire congregation. After the service, she asked him what he thought of the morning's events. "Well," he said, "I didn't think much of the cookies, and there wasn't enough juice."    Another woman brought her grandson along for Episcopal services. The boy watched as the priest at the altar prepared Communion and said, "Look, Grandma... God is making Kool-Aid."    When his father returned and knelt in prayer after receiving the Blessed Host, a 14-year-old asked, "They got any chocolate ones up there?"    Not all children are disappointed by what's served at Communion. A teenager's mother tells me he came home after a week at church camp to report that Communion was the only decent meal they had.    A boy overheard his parents talking about going to the Lord's Supper and told his brother, "I hope we have chicken!"    The last word on Communion comes from a four-year-old Catholic boy who told his dad what had happened in church that day: "That Father called on some of the people to come down front, and he gave them each an Alka-Seltzer [or a Mentos] !"

       Love  is patient and kind.  Love  is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud.  Love  is not rude, is not selfish and does not get upset with others.  Love  does not count up wrongs that have been done.  Love  is not happy with evil but is happy with the truth.  Love  patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always remains strong.  1 Cor. 13:4-7  It is far better to  forgive   and   forget  than to resent and remember.  Anonymous   I am only one, But still  I am one . I cannot do everything, But still  I can do something ; and because I cannot do everything,  I will not refuse to do the something  that I can do.   Edward Everett Hale's pledge to the Lend-a-Hand Society   Kindnesss  is  Christianity  with its  working clothes  on.  Anonymous  We must not only  give what we have ; we must also  give what we are .  Cardinal Mercia  The  great acts of love  are done by those who are  habitually performing   small acts of kindness .  Anonymous  Let us not be satisfied with just giving money.  Money is not enough , money can be got, but  they need your hearts  to love them. So,  spread your love  everywhere you go; first of all  in your own home . Give love to your children, to your wife or husband, to a  next-door neighbor .  Mother Teresa  It is  kindness  in a person,  not beauty , which  wins our love .
