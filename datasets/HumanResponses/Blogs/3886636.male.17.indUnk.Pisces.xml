       ahahahahahahAHAHHHA!!!! i'm done my fucking driver's ed at AMB!!!!! sweeeeet!!!! gooodaaaamn those were prolly the most boring days of my life. but the humour of my teacher just makes it a whole better. i recommend amb driving school's peter mellor for those who still need to go thru driver's ed. he's funny as hell, he curses and says racist jokes (well, they're not racist but he makes certain funny yet true remarks about certain cultures, but nothing offensive) and he's got experience with cars. what a week. oh yeah, i'm officially hired at bombay kids!!! sweeet!!! gunna begin training next tuesday, and i need clothes to work in cuz they got a certain dress-code (gotta wear apron and not wear anything with logos on it). gunna be payed like minimum wage but whatever, s'all good. i haven't really done much with the graphics for cash or crash, i'm becoming so lazy. but damn, gotta finish stuff soon cuz the deadline is in 10 days (end of the first week of august). BUY THE GAME DAMNIT!!!! THAT'S RIGHT, BUY IT!!!! time to sleep in, finally. camping this long weekend, awesome!!!! k, peace.

       goddamn, today i woke up early to go to amb driving school for the first day of driver's ed. it was pretty damn boring, but hey what can you do. the instructor was funny though and he told the class a lot of interesting things and he was appeared in one of the videos he showed the class. ate partial taco bell for lunch, i dunno why it is that i always can't finish a fast food meal and i get sick halfway thru. well whatever. that was that, after a long day, i came back home and found out that bombay company had called me, i'm assuming the manager had checked my references (mr. bolden and mrs. sajo) and i'm sure they had good things to say about me so i'm gunna go back tmr after driving school to see what's up. 3 more days, just 3 more days. and then movie and camping!!!! sweeet!!!! oh yeah, RSSSY has sorta been revived, though RSSSY is only the temporary name. chowda. peace.

       well, i called bombay kids and told the manager my references and hopefully they'll get back to me like next week, i'm hoping to start working asap and make some cash.   yesterday, went with robin, sam, stephen and aron to see   the bourne supremacy   at fmp. it was pretty amazing. i liked it quite a lot. matt damon's character, jason bourne, is a genius and he does a lot of amazing things. obviously, cuz he was trained to do certain things and man, it was awesome. the car scene was one helluva of joyride and when it stopped, it felt like the end of a fun rollercoaster, seriously!!! damn, it was awesome. but i'm still weighing if its better than the first one,   the bourne identity   since the originals are usually better than the sequels, but i dunno. they're about the same, but i think the original always beats the sequels, obviously because its hard to add onto an already good storyline and what not. too much camera holding though and some ppl suffered slight headaches, but overall, i loved the movie.   today, i woke up at freakin 5am to go fishing with my dad and uncle at silent lake provincial park, located in bancroft, ontario (somewhat east of peterborough i believe). it was interesting. we rented a canoe and went paddling into the middle and edges of the lake. i dint feel comfortable at first but i got used to it. we caught a lot of small fish thom, no big fish at all unfortunately. then the crazy part was when we went to the small island, i got off and then we stayed there for a while and then i decided to get back on. my uncle was the last to get on, but apparently the boat tipped to the right and water flooded the canoe. and damnit, i was soaked from the waste down. we then took everything out of the canoe and turned it upside down to let the water out. then we paddled back, luckily my digital camera was still working. thank god!!! otherwise i'd be fucking mad like crazy. all in all, it was a fun day. hope to do that again next week when i go camping at murphy's point, but i'm gunna be doing solo canoing (one-man canoe) and it'll be sweeeeeet. peace.

       yesterday, i spent the middle portion of my day at markville with alice, slowly goin around to each of the stores giving out our resumes. i managed to get one interview out of the 23 resumes i handed out. the interview was for bombay kids (that's where janki works as well) and i think it went pretty well today. as long as i have my references, i'll most likely be hired. unfortunately, for alice, she was only seeking a summer job so she was unable to hand in a lot of resumes and dunno what the prospects of that will be. bombay kids is probably not my first choice, but jobs can never be first choices since you get what you get. graphics for game i'm still working on, deadline is in three weeks so thats the end of the first week of august. damn. oh yeah, gunna get some driving lessons with robin before he heads to taiwan in august. anyone know of any good schools, just holler. peace.

       wow, today was pretty awesome. firstly i woke up like around 12ish and was doin my game graphics, sorta pissed at the colour scheme fo the whole thing. if i could, i woulda gone all crazy, but i have limits as to what i can do, anyhow yeah. went over to robin's place for a while and then hitched a ride in sam's car to watch   i, robot   at cineplex@fmp. me, robin, sam, stephen, aron and wayne. man, it was actually pretty good movie. i saw the trailer, i dint expect much, i thought it was some cliche kinda movie where human technology goes kinda berzerk, but it was more than that. somewhat anti-climactic i must say, but the special effects were pretty damn nice, some new stuff i haven't really seen, robin told me like 900+ special effects were used? man, that's crazy. it says a lot about how human kind is fucked up and we're gunna eventually kill ourselves, pretty scary since that sorta the path we're taking right now in the real world. sunny, the "good robot" was unique and dint get killed but he saw a vision in his dream where he stood beside an old bridge with the other robots looking at him. hmmm, we all were pondering what the ending meant, i think that he's gunna be the robots saviour which would eventually lead to another kinda conflict in the sequel, if there is one. but then it might not be possible if he goes bad since he's already good but yeah... that was the movie. next, we headed over to laser quest in richmond hill. first time going, MAN, it was damn fun. i worked up a sweat running/walking around the dark maze shooting ppl with my laser gun. some stupid kid got like first place or something and told me i couldnt shoot him, i dunno what the hell that was, but yeah. i shot lots ppl and ppl kept shooting me, man it was soo annoying when it made that stupid sound and vibrated, but yeah, it was a cool experience. dark lights and bad odours: sweeeet! anyway, yeah, that was my cool ass day today. peace.

       well, still workin on the computer game today, currently making a graphic of three lawyers. anywho, guess what, they finally began advertising   resident evil: apocalypse  !!!! check out their sick site: re2.com. coming out september 10th, can't wait!!!! i loved the first   resident evil  , most would say that it was crap, but personally, i thought it was awesome. RE wasn't scary or anything, but i just loved the high-tech gizmo and techiness of the whole thing, lol, i actually used lines from the movie for my drama vocal masque, which i thought was crap, but i loved the movie!!! "you're alll goin to die down here..." wow, red queen, she freaky. basically, the story is that alice is out to stop the zombies that escaped from the hive. umbrella corporation opened up the doors and now raccoon city is all infested, mwahah. but for those who've played the game, this actually relates more to   resident evil: nemesis   and not with   resident evil 2  . gunna be awesome!!! later.

       ah... another few days have past and nothing much has happened lately. everyone's still busy with summer school and what not. i've been stayin home surfing the net for some interesting things:   half-life 2  ,   doom 3  , and some other interesting games. currently i'm playing   psi-ops: the mindgate conspiracy   on my ps2. its a pretty sick game cuz you have to use your mind to kill ppl, and you use telekinesis to move objects around, so damn cool. yeah, besides from that, nothing much. next i'm gunna try and go around and hand in some resumes to various locations, stupid ppl dint call me for a job interview yet. and i've given like so many resumes/applications to places, but whatever, i'll get a job soon hopefully.   still working on   cash or crash   right now with kgc inc. we plan to release it by the end of summer. i think that's all for today, peace.

       today i woke up pretty damn early (5:45) to go fishing up north in campbellford. worse part was that i dint fall asleep until 2:30-something that night so i was pretty freakin tired, but i eventually got up. me, my 'rents, and my uncle henry headed up to one of the locks in campbellford and we fished there for a while. not a whole lotta fish, most of em were pretty small ones that we threw back into the water. my hook got stuck onto a couple places and me and my parents hooks always got stuck underneath the rocks. my dad was constantly reattaching the weight and the hook onto the fishing line. eventually, we headed into the town area and ate brunch at a small cafe. later on, we headed over to lock #10 where we met up with some of my parents church/family friends. i saw many boats come and go on the locks and it was pretty cool, i noticed there were a lot of american boats cuz they had american flags on em, one was from rhode island. i was constantly taking photos with my dijee cam and hopefully i can post them on whenever i can or have the time. my dad eventually caught two medium small mouth bass which we had for dinner tonight, yummy. me, my dad, and my uncle caught a total of about 10 fishes today and it was awesome. oh yeah, i spent about an hour or so baking in the sun and soakin in some rays. then we headed back home and i took a nice relieving shower.   hmm, now that   half-life   and   no one lives forever   are both beaten, i'm not really too sure what i'm gunna do for the next couple of days. but damn, i seriously wanna get the sequels to those two games.   no one lives forever 2: a spy in h.a.r.m.'s way  , and   half-life 2  ! man, the storyline was pretty damn intense and freaky, i loved it. i'm gunna get em later this month, hopefully. peace.

       well, what can i say? summer is crap, well, sorta. i've spent the last couple of days couped up inside my stinkin house not doin much. but i do have a "job" though and i do "work". that is... i'm making graphics for a game. working with these two guys (alex and frank) that wayne introduced me to in ottawa. so far, everything's goin pretty good. its a business simulator, and i'm making frame by frame. game's called   cash or crash  , buy it when its released, haha. if you don't buy it, i'll not only be offended, i won't get paid, lol.   besides from work, i've been playing a tunsa games lately. last week i was addicted to playing   no one lives forever  . its a must play! and today i just finished playing   half-life  . OMG, this game totally rocks!!! man, its just amazing... i dunno how to explain it. first, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay style is totally awesome, and like, the storyline, oh the storyline.... its like stephen king's style man. i dunno how to explain it, you gotta play it yourself! my bro bought it in 2000 i think? but i dint play it until now, man, its AWESOME!!!   still unemployed, still looking for a steady part-time job, i'm sure you can relate! gunna go to campbellford tomorrow for a day of fishing, bbq, and ontario nature. peace.
