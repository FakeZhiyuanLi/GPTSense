      "......Transactions provide a way to bundle a set of operations into an atomic execution unit.  This atomic, all or nothing property is not new: it appears throughout life.

Only if they both respond "I do" does the minister pronounce them married and commit the transaction. In short, within any transaction, several independent entities must agree before the deal is done. If any party disagrees, the deal is off and the independent entities are reverted back to their original state. In transactions, this is known as a rollover operation......"  有時候，為了解釋一些問題，舉例子往往是最有效的方法。就好像以上的這個問題，一針見血，讀了就會明白。電腦往往不過如此，只是被太多的專有名詞迷惑，讓初學者還沒入門，就感到迷惘。好的解釋也同樣不過如此，深入淺出，三言兩語間讓讀者印象深刻。
