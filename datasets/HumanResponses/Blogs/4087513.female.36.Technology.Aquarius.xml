      Where do I begin? Where do I begin to draw a picture of the world? Where do I begin to draw a picture of the world accurately and honestly? I suspect it begins with the realization that this is  only  a beginning, so I suppose some fundamentals are in order. Which isn't to imply that the beginning is anything but essential. After all, without a beginning, nothing can follow.  It has taken me 30 years to figure out as much as I have, and while I certainly believe that I'm on the right track, I always cultivate a certain amount of doubt. Much of what I believe could be characterized as conjecture or opinion, which implies by their very nature that I could be wrong about them, yet I prefer to think of them as reasoning and value judgments. But I do try to keep an open mind, since, if there's one thing that history has taught us, it is that everyone so far has been wrong in one way or another.  This doubt is partly a dread that I  am  wrong, and that something even worse than I can fathom is wrong with the world, or that there isn't a way to save ourselves from ourselves. But it is also partly a hope that enough of us have sufficient empathy and courage to try to make a difference.  Part of my doubts stem from the very fundamental fact that, as much as we might like to forget it, our entire experience of the world is filtered through very limited senses, and that  most  of what we believe comes from others, who are, at very best, equally limited. I won't go in the deep end that leads to Cartesian or Matrixian doubt about the true nature of existence and whether we're all even here to begin with. While I find that line of thought interesting, it is mainly counter-productive when I remember that, like it or not,  this  is the only life I've have been given to live. My point is that I must doubt my sources as much as I doubt opposing views, since there is, at very least, the  possibility  that whatever ignorance, stubborness or partiality that I attribute to holders of opposing views can apply to one of the links in the chain of people who connect me to the discoverer of any given "fact" that I hold to be true.  And then finally, my doubts are fundamentally symptoms of both my perfectionism, which leads me to always feel that there's a better way, and the resulting fear of failing to "get it right". While, intellectually, I realize this is irrational, it is something I am just starting to be able to overcome, and this is really what's in the process of beginning here.
