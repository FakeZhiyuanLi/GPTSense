      Did I manage to make a trip to the library as planned? nope. Did I make to to Stephanie's wedding as planned? nope. Is my  urlLink astrological forecast  for June out yet? NONONO! BTW, if anyone out there is interested ni horoscopes and stuff, the site linked is pretty good. Quite accurate lor.  I haven't done anything planned. I haven't done my crew bible, I haven't cancelled the sports channels for my SCV. Haven't cancelled my internet subscription... i'm screwed. I haven't changed money for my trip next week either. and i haven't packed. and I haven't seen my ward leader. can you spell DYSFUNCTIONAL??  I had a TONNE of stuff to do. Instead, I stayed home the whole weekend and watched  Daria Disenfranchised  for maybe the 256th time. Also saw  Love Actually  finally... and I slept. and slept and slept and slept. I even planned to go to the gym. that didn't materialise either. man...   haiyah. Fuck it la, huh? Tomorrow will be a better day. I go sleep first.

      This was probably one of the best flights I've done. Paxed up to Zurich, arrived in the morning, and even had a clear day there. Crew working on the way up were fantastic. Crew I went up with were great as well. Only blech thing were the pax when I worked back.  I slept and slept on the way up to Zurich, and also managed to catch a couple of movies. Finally saw 50 First Dates. It was hilarious. Rob Schneider is the best. It wasn't as good as everyone claims, though. Which is why I try not to watch movies that everyone tells me I  must  catch. They never fail to disappoint somewhat. One of my batchboys was working while I paxed up. He was one of those loners in class while we were training. But he seemed all right while working. It was weird having to change into my uniform before landing cos I'm sure the other passengers were wondering what was going on.  Tasha finally got her mamasan bag. They sewed her name wrong, though. The bag technically belongs to Tarsha. I'm thinking of changing my cabin bag. It's all boxy and weighs a tonne. Such a bitch putting it in the overhead compartment. I'm eyeing a Bally bag, but I've still got my doubts. The leather gets quite ugly after a while. Doesn't really season well.  Tasha, Jasmine and I caught a train to Uetliberg - Top of Zurich on our clear day. The view was beautiful, and the air was so fresh. We were running late, though, so we didn't really get to the top of zurich. We wouldn've missed the last train back to the city otherwise. We also took a city tour on a trolley, which took us to the university area. I was reminded of my own university days in Melbourne. So sad.  Zurich kinda reminds me of Melbourne. Laid back, clean, safe. Things were a tad more expensive, but it didn't stop me from buying all those chocolates and truffles at Sprungli. I gobbled all the truffles as soon as I got back. Delicious. I miss it already. Come to think of it, everything looked really good at the shop.  Jasmine wanted McDonald's for dinner, so we all spent CHF12.00 (each, mind you) on a meal. I would rather have had room service, to be honest. Ooh! I had a doner kebab the night before from some shop called new point 2 or soemthing, and it was good too. I keep trying to remind myself to go on a diet, but I just love food too much.  All in all, I had a pretty good time in Zurich, even though I was told it was a really boring station. The trip back was such a bitch, though. And the crew were a good bunch. Hate to imagine if they were nasty... nightmare... Still, I can't wait to go back to Zurich.

      First I got called up to do an indonesian turn. It was all right. Every working day's a new learning experience for me right now. Colleagues were real nice, which always helps. Still feel like a klutz at work, though. But it gets better, or so I'm told. I think I saw my uncle at work. but I'm not so sure if it was him. Reason being, he was fostered out as a young child, and we don't see him all that much. He didn't seem to recognise me.  Saw PC right before i went to work. She was so sweet. She arranged my uniform for me. It was such a motherly gesture. Pity she's still seeing brow-less. What a waste. She's got so much to offer as a person,, and she doesn't know it.  Got back from work, and I bought dessert for my parents. Lounged at home, and got too bored, so called Ad, and we went to Tru's place to have dinner. His mom's cooking is DA BOMB. I was so full I couldn't speak. omigod... the sambal prawns... drool... Then we just hung out till Ad's eyelids couldn't keep open anymore. Borrowed some movies. I'll have something to keep me occupied then.  Spoke to lulu, and BX, an old friend from college. Turns out his girlfriend's going to be a stewardess as well. cool. Meeting up for dinner tomorrow night. Must remember to go print stuff while I'm at the office.  Going to the gym tomorrow. yaye.

      I just had a serving of cup noodles and about 5000 biscuits. I'm a pig. Feel all bloated. Need a smoke. Just went to the gym today, and I'm binge-ing already. WHAT? I go to the gym and I smoke? yes. yes, I do. I go to the gym because I'm trying to get healthy and strong. And i smoke because I'm addicted. pure and simple.  the madras turn was actually quite all right. Passengers weren't so bad, but rest of crew were quite surprised pax were so well-behaved as well, so it might have just been a one-off thing. It was tiring all the same, having to work the night through. arrived in sin at bout 7 in the morning, and still had enough energy left to take a train home. woohoo. Nose was hurting, though. must make mental note to bring inhaler next time.  the mom's making me pay for a plasma tc for the new house. do I look like I print money in my spare time? pshh... she 'asked', but in reality, she Informed me that I was paying for the tv. I'm just complaining cos it costs so much, but I really do think it's only right for me to contribute to the new home. I love my family. blech. gross.  I'm glad i'm going to the gym tomorrow. Wonder if i should bring trainers to zurich. in case there's a hotel gym, and i find that i haven't anything better to do.

      Hey to anyone who's actually reading this. I just got back from my hkg-sfo flight. Well, not just, really. About three days ago. It feels like I JUST got back cos I've been home sick for three days. I thought I'd contracted sars... having developed a fever upon returning from hong kong. Luckily the temperature went away. Now I'm sniffling like mad. How I'm going to do my flight tomorrow... who knows... I've been warned that if I were to take sick leave during my probationary period, that it'd be extended. Like I give a shit if it's extended or not, really. I mean, I really AM sick, you see... duh... but I'm adamant about not taking sick leave tomorrow cos it's an MAA flight, and I don't want anyone to think I chickened out of the flight.  hoo hoo... more about my trip to san francisco. it was my first time ever, ever to the states. It's all right. It's no sex and the city, and there certainly weren't any blahnik-clad carries' running around the streets. I keep hearing people complaining about our country and how restrictive it is, and how much they just wanna run away to the states.. I'm thinking, are you insane? what makes you think it's any better there? what makes you think people are any different or less selfish or less racist there? Why would you want to run away to a place that only exists as a projection? you must be mad. siaogao.  I'm listening to an old texas album. some things just don't get old.  I missed my gym appointments this week cos I fell sick and also cos I overslept (not in that order). I feel like I've put on a lot of weight. I think it's cos of all the snacking i did while I was away. My face looks fat. I'd put up pictures, but I don't have a camera. I'd get a camera, but I want one I can only get in Japan. yeppp... that's how anal I get. And since I'm not going to japan anytime soon, there won't be photos on this blog anytime soon.  i blabber. a lot. blabber.
