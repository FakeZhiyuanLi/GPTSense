      Philadelphia teams always break your heart.  You know, that "things are going great... then  BAM  and you feel like you got punched in the gut" type of feeling.  The series was awesome however.  Best game of the year,  urlLink Game 6

      It continues to amaze me how people all over the world bash the US.  Already at least 3 people have been publicly beheaded because we won't release Iraqi prisoners.  Why are these people getting murdered in public?  Why it MUST be Bush's fault!!!  You just can't negotiate with these sickos.  Imagine what the mideast would be like if the US wasn't in there.  If people like Michael Moore had their way, these sick f---s would still be running around doing whatever they want.  The prisoner abuse thing was a disaster, no two ways about it.  I haven't seen any abused Iraqis turn up without a head though.

       urlLink Pistons win, the Lakers lost.  Gotta love it!   Let's make it 2 for 2 and have the Yankees lose... or better yet, not even make the playoffs.

      I have gotten pulled over a few times in my driving career, but this last one takes the prize.   It was for not having  a   hand  on the steering wheel.  (Notice the singular form of the word there)    80 dollars later, can you please pass the vaseline?????
