      I haven't updated this in a few days.  Mostly because I've had nothing of real importance to add.  I worked Friday and Saturday nights, thus eliminating any semblance of a weekend, although I did spend part of Saturday at Joe's watching the Mets/Yankees game (we must be good luck together, as they won.  Every game we go to at Shea together they also win.  Good things happen when me and Joe are together, I suppose).  Sunday I did nothing.  That I can blame solely on me choosing to be a lazy bastard.    Monday I went to the Phillies game with my friend Jeff.  It was my first trip to the new ballpark, but I still had the sense that I've been there before.  See, people criticised the multi-purpose stadiums like Riverfront Stadium, Veterans Stadium, and Three Rivers Stadium in the 70's.  "They're cookie-cutter stadiums," people would protest.  And they were right.  They were built so teams could play football and baseball in the same stadium, yet were enjoyable to neither group of fans.  Now the new thing is building the seperate stadiums.  Football stadiums seem to all be the same.  I don't think there is any difference between them whatsoever other than the name brand on the front of the stadium and the colour of the seats.  Possibly the cuisine too, depending on geography.  The baseball stadiums are a little better, but they still all have a similar formula.  Improved sightlines and "cozier" atmosphere - Check. Super huge scoreboard - Check.  Barbeque stand run by former major leaguer - Check.  Major restaurant chain in left field - Check.  Expanded clubhouse shop full of gimmicks for the team to sell - Check Some sort of "History of the Franchise" exhibit that the old stadium couldn't be bothered with - Check.  Camden Yards started this trend, so it gets props for originality.  And sure, most other fields have their own little quirks to them to make them different.  But really, there isn't a huge difference between the Cit, PNC, Camden Yards, etc.  Of course, those are the only three I've been to, so I'll just have to assume that the rest are like this.  If I'm wrong, feel free to leave feedback for me.  I have yet to receive one piece of feedback, so I have no evidence whatsoever that people are reading these.  So if you're reading this, and even if I'm right on my theory that all new stadiums are the same, just let me know somebody is reading this.  I am a pathetic soul, I am aware.  Anyway, what's on tap for this week?  Tomorrow is a "WCW" day.  That stands for West Coast Wednesday.  The name came because I used to go to my friend Jeff's house late at night for PS2 playing sessions, often arriving there at around 11 PM.  Because they started so late, around the time West Coast baseball games would start, the name "West Coast Wednesdays" was given to the events, whether they took place on Wednesdays or not.  Now, even the events that take place at 8 PM on a Thursday (as most of them have been) are called WCW.  I suppose another name could be given to them, but at this point, why bother?  Thursday is school and the radio show (www.wmcx.com, the link should work this week, last week we had web technical difficulties).  Friday I work.  Boo.  Saturday I'm going to Mets/Yankees at Shea Stadium.  If you're there, look for the fella wearing an authentic Ty Wigginton road grey jersey.  And Sunday is the 4th of July, where I will be spending at least part of the day at work.  Double boo.  At some point this week, perhaps Thursday during my seven hour break between class and my radio shift (you read that right, seven hours of time to kill) I'll probably check out the new Spider-Man movie.  Perhaps I'll even do a review here or on the radio.  And maybe something unexpected will come up.  I doubt it.  Anyway, that's today's update.  Hopefully better ones await.

      Yeah, I'm not happy about working at Domino's.  Anybody who knows me will not be even 1% shocked by that.  I constantly bitch and moan about working at that god-forsaken place.  But it's a little different this time.  Well, first, I should mention that working in Morrisville continues to suck.  I'm still not happy working there.  So I've been trying to get back in Robbinsville, now that my issue with working there is no longer there.  So I called Sam, whom I once considered to be a good pal (he used to constantly say that we were like brothers, and while I may never have reciprocated that particular feeling, I did like working with the guy and all), and he tells me that he'll call me if they need me to work there.  This offended me HORRIBLY.  I worked at that fucking store for six years.  Most people that worked there work there for three months and quit, usually without notice, if they even last three months.  I gave like seven weeks' notice that I'd be leaving, after having been the best god damned employee they ever had.  I was the best driver they had.  Nobody knew that area better than me, even after not having worked there in four months.  I was the best manager they ever had.  Every manager they had before me stole money from that place like crazy.  Just about every other person that ever ran shift in that store stole money from that place.  I never stole a dime.  Also, during the year plus that I was manager, I raised sales unlike anybody ever had before.  The previous manager, Gene, didn't give a crap about raising sales, just about working his twenty hours a week and getting out of there.  I earned every dollar of my salary, working the 55 hours a week I was supposed to for my salary.  With a crew that had maybe two good workers besides me, I made that store more profitable than it had ever been.  I didn't ask for help, I didn't need help.  I did it all basically by myself.  I sacrificed my summer so we could raise sales and do good business.    Then I ask for a job and I'm told that they'll call me?  They seriously should be begging me to go back.  I did more for that store than everybody else that has ever worked there combined.  No matter what facet of the business you're talking about, I was the best that store ever had and ever will have.  They should have called me, I shouldn't have had to call them, but I was unhappy working in Morrisville.  And then they say they'll call me?  Don't bother, I'm not going back to Robbinsville now.  Fuck that.  If you don't realise what I bring to the table enough to take my offer when I make it, I have no use for you.    Now I have to look for something outside of the pizza industry (which is probably for the best, anyway) because I really don't like working in Morrisville.  The whole mentality there stinks, and with me not working full-time, I doubt I can do anything to change it.  Plus, I hate working with Don.  He's so abrasive when it comes to dealing with employees.  The way he sarcastically cuts people down and such just pisses me off.  oh well, if you have any ideas as to a job I can pursue that can keep me out of these shitty pizza jobs, feel free to leave them in the comments section.  Finally, I got to see Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night.  I saw it Friday at 12:01 AM after my radio show went off the air (I stayed on until 11 PM, doing NBA draft coverage all night).  I have to say, I enjoyed it.  It was a movie targeted towards somebody like me to begin with, since I am quite liberal in my beliefs, and there wasn't a chance in hell that I'd vote for Bush.  It is important to note that while watching these films like Fahrenheit 9/11, that Michael Moore has an agenda he is trying to push, in this case to get Bush out of office.  As such, you have to take into account that he may fudge a fact here or there to get that agenda across.  While it may be an agenda I agree with, at the same time you must consider that this is ultimately a movie that has both the purposes to entertain and teach, but mostly entertain.  So if you do watch the film, keep those things in mind.  And I'm babbling now, so I will call it a night.  I'll probably give this another update on Sunday, as I seem to be falling into a schedule of updating every other day.  We'll see how long I can keep it up, but so far it's been cathartic to write these.  Until next time...fuck Domino's.

      What the hell does that mean?  It means that, while I am adding content to the blog today, nothing of note will be said.  I'm warning you in advance, you can skip this one.  I'm updating out of sheer boredom more than anything else.  The last two days have been uneventful.  I worked on Tuesday.  Still don't like working in Morrisville.  I tend to get out later, and plus I worked as a driver on Tuesday under this guy Don.  Don used to be the manager when I worked in Robbinsville originally, then left.  Then I became manager in Robbinsville years later.  Now we're working together again, only I feel as though I'm much better at Don (since I'm younger and have more energy).  This cannot possibly make for a good dynamic down the line.  We'll see what happens.  Today I had off.  I spent the day avoiding my dad, who was in a grumpy mood because, according to him, my mom won't let him spend more than $3,000 on a car.  My mom contends this is a fabrication.  I love my dad, but sometimes he imagines things in his head that simply are not so.  Then he spends hour upon hour moping about them.  I got out of the house, went window shopping for a while, then inexplicably bought a PC version of Monopoly at Best Buy for $10.  Hey, I loved playing Monopoly as a child, and $10 is pretty cheap.  I went to Subway today and bought a Grapeade just to see if the world's most attractive sandwich artist still worked there.  She does, but she looked younger than I previously remembered, like fifteenish.  Oh well, no more random Grapeade purchases there.  I also got a haircut.  I'm the kind of lazy bastard that gets about four haircuts a year.  It's my opinion that I should grow my hair out to a reasonable legnth before going to the trouble of cutting it.  Plus, I'm cheap.  I then came home and listened to my dad bitch and moan about this and that for a few hours before he went to bed.  Then I played some Monopoly (I have no life, remember, my friends never want to do anything) and updated this.  Tomorrow should be an interesting day.  Well, at least more interesting than today.  I have a 2:45 PM appointment with my Senior Seminar professor.  In lieu of classes, the class is meeting with her one-on-one.  We will be discussing my progress on our big paper, or lack thereof.  Actually, I will pretend I'm making progress on said paper and hope she doesn't realise that I'm full of shit.  Then at 6 PM that night, that's when the magic happens.  The Cox Show will beam out to listeners in the Monmouth and Ocean county areas in New Jersey, and live on the internet at www.wmcx.com.  This week, I plan on discussing who I feel should be the new PA announcer for the New Jersey Nets, my usual unusual takes on weather and traffic, somewhat-live NBA draft coverage...and definitely, DEFINITELY more Chingy.  After that, I may try to kill three more hours (or just stay on the radio, as nobody comes on after me and I doubt anybody would notice or care that I'm staying on the air) and see a 12:01 showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 at Monmouth Mall.  It looks like it will be at least an interesting movie and I look forward to seeing it.  I guess I got some mileage out of this after all.  I'm starting to get the hang of this and I think I'm starting to like it.  Which means I will now not update for like three weeks.  But maybe not, so check back again later this week.  I have no current weekend plans (I work Friday and Saturday nights, and Sunday I'm off with nothing to do) so we'll see if I get a weekend update (but NOT with fake news, sadly) in there.  Until then, you keep it real, holmes.

      Yes, my friends, we've got a second update in less than three days.  Isn't that amazing?  It took a month for me to update the last one I had, and then I never updated it again.  The new format helps.  I think blocking Chrispy has helped too, because instead of endlessly mocking the sorry son of a bitch, I think of other things to do, like update this.  Well, not a lot has happened since the last update.  I worked on Sunday.  I needed a quick summer job, so I decided to work at a Domino's Pizza in Morrisville, PA.  I used to manage a Domino's in Robbinsville, NJ, but I left last winter for a myriad of reasons, one of which was because I took an 18 credit workload this past semester, including a 15 hour a week internship at SportsRadio 610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The other reason is kind of personal, maybe I'll go into detail about it one day, but don't get your hopes up on that one.  Let's just say it didn't leave me wanting to go back and leave it at that.  Anyway, one of my friends who used to run Robbinsville (Gene from the last update) now works in Morrisville and invited me to work there with him, and since I wouldn't have to deal with my Robbinsville problems, I accepted.  Now, I'm not so sure I should have.  The people there are nice, but I kind of feel like a subsitute teacher when I'm there as opposed to somebody who's in charge.  In Robbinsville, I was the man, but in Morrisville, I'm really just a fill-in.  I don't know, maybe it will get better.  Now for today's rant.  I've been reading "The Bad Guys Won," an account of the 1986 New York Mets and the trials and tribulations they had in winning the World Series.  A good portion of the book talks about Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden.  When I was 10 years old, there were few athletes I admired in the world more than Darryl Strawberry.  Gary Carter may have been the only one.  I remember feeling just horrible when he signed with the Dodgers in '90.  I felt let down by one of my heroes.  With Carter, it wasn't the same because he was really coming up on the end of his career by then.  Darryl was entering his prime, and he and the Mets had gone through so much together, and it seemed like there should have been more chapters in that story.  In retrospect, it may not have been a bad thing that he left, because he ended up self-destructing, which was truly a shame.  But, when I think of a lot of my sports heroes from when I was younger...Darryl Strawberry was right there near the top of the list.  So was Dwight Gooden.  In fact, still to this day, a framed poster of Dwight Gooden from the mid-80's hangs in my room, more because I'm too lazy to take it down than anything.  But I remember using my birthday money to buy that when I was a youngster, which meant a lot because when I was 11 or 12, I just didn't have a lot of money.  Then Doc started having his troubles with drugs, which is human.  I can't fault him for that, I guess.  Then I grew older, Doc lost whatever athletic magic he may have once held, and he left the team, throwing a no-hitter for the Yankees in '95.   He's had his ups and downs, but he's seemingly been in better shape over the last few years than Darryl.  Still, here was another sports hero that turned out to be something less than I hoped.  Not all of my sports heroes were baseball players.  I remember thinking that when the Nets drafted Derrick Coleman, that he was going to be the saviour of the franchise.  DC had so many athletic gifts.  If ability alone determined greatness, Derrick Coleman could have been the best power forward of all time.  The next year, the Nets drafted Kenny Anderson, forming a 1-2 punch that should have carried them throughout the 90's.  Drazen Petrovic was also around to nail down the three's and provide scoring.  I even liked Chris Morris.  They made the playoffs for the first time under Chuck Daly, then the following year contended with the hated Knicks for the Atlantic Division.  Only John Starks cheating and breaking Kenny Anderson's wrist (I still to this day hate him for this) cost them that division.  Everything was going to be okay.  Then, everything wasn't okay.  First, Petro died in the car crash.  Then they drafted Yinka Dare.  Then Chuck Daly left.  Enter Butch Beard.  Beard ended up not being able to control Kenny Anderson and Derrick Coleman.  DC had such a horrible attitude, he was traded so the Nets could draft Shawn Bradley.  Then Kenny Anderson was traded.  It was awful, the team just self-destructed.  And through the years, DC and Kenny never really found their form from when they first came into the league.  DC wound up being one of the worst clubhouse influences of all time.  His attitude withered away what could have been amazing game.  Same with Kenny Anderson.  The point of all of this?  All of my athletic heroes wound up sucking and sucking hard.  Sometimes it was due to addictions, sometimes it was just because they didn't give a crap, but in the end, none of them were the heroes I thought them to be.  And that's the moral to this story.  If you're a kid, don't idolise athletes.  They are human and infallible just like anybody else.  Don't idolise anybody, really.  We all have our flaws as humans.  Just aspire to be the best person you can be day in and day out.  But if you do have to idolise somebody, don't idolise athletes.  Just because they have the skill to hit the ball hard, or to sink the impossible three pointer, or to throw a pinpoint pass in traffic to a wide receiver, does not mean they are a good person.  Respect their athletic abilities, root for the players on your favourite team as hard as you can, but don't idolise them.  Do your best to seperate the person they are on the field from the person they are off of it.  They are, just like you, only human.  That was long.  Next one won't be so long, I promise.

      Okay, well...I tried doing a blog and I didn't update it too much.  Probably because I've been busy.  Okay, that's a blatant lie, I'm just a lazy bastard.  But maybe without me having to go through the trouble of designing anything, blogging will be easier.  We'll see what happens.  So what's been going on?  Well, last I left you was the winter.  I finished my spring semester at Monmouth strong, pulling in two A's, an A-, and three B+'s, finishing with a 3.6 GPA.  I'm just that bad ass.  Yes, I am aware that calling yourself a "bad ass" in an internet blog for having a strong GPA probably isn't actually that bad ass.  But, I'm just that weird.  What else has been going on...well, I'm still single.  Don't see that one changing anytime soon.  I met a girl I really liked in one of my classes, and for once I didn't hide or anything.  I actually went up and talked to her, ate lunch with her once, talked to her outside of class.  These all seem like perfectly normal things that people do on a daily basis, but they represent progress for me because I am just terrible in social situations.  I don't know why, I just am.  It's why I have a small group of friends, and why I've never really had a steady girlfriend.  I am as socially inept a motherfucker as you'll ever find.  Even among my friends...I have two friends I'd consider really good, close friends (Travis and Joe).  I have two other friends who I'm somewhat close to, but feel as though I may be drifting apart from, for whatever reason (Grim and Jeff, neither of whom I see as often as I used to).  I have two other "friends" whom I can't stand (Brandon and Chrispy).  I have my two online friends whom I've never met (MJD and Ryan).  All of my friends seem to be in pairs, that's weird.  And I have Gene, my work friend who doesn't have a pair to match up with, whom I don't see that often anymore.  That's it.  And I suck at meeting new people.  Which leads to nights like tonight.  Tonight was a Saturday night.  I stayed home and watched an SNL repeat with Donald Trump.  The reason?  Well, Joe's married and has real world responsibilities (he's a school teacher, and this is his busy time of the month).  Travis lives an hour away.  Jeff is in Indiana for some reason.  Grim...well, I really don't hear from Grim too often anymore (other than last weekend).  Brandon and Chrispy are perfectly content to never do anything with anybody, and just sit around all night on AOL Instant Messanger while playing stupid online video war simulators.    On a tangent...let me just say that those online war simulators make me sick.  These guys are sitting around killing people on their little computer screens while people are dying out in Iraq every day.  Not just soliders, but innocent civilians whose only violation was living in Iraq.  We are in Iraq, fighting a war we have no business fighting, killing innocent civilians and other human beings.  For what reason?  So stupid ass Bush can get himself reelected.  I feel bad for the families who have lost their sons, their daughters, their husbands, their wives, their fathers, their mothers...both Iraqi and American.  This shouldn't be happening right now.  And meanwhile, people are sitting on their fat asses, eating Cheetos and drinking Pepsi and simulating killing these same people.  What the fuck?  Anyway, back off the tangent.  Brandon and Chrispy don't hang out, ever.  So they're out.  MJD and Ryan, they live far away.  And Gene is also married, although he hangs out with his buddies all the time anyway, but I don't seem to be in that group.  So that leaves ol' Cox sitting at home watching TV, using the computer (because there's nothing on TV on Saturday nights because most people are out doing stuff) and wondering where everything went wrong.  I asked for a weekend day off a week from work specifically so I could hang out, and I never hang out.  That makes no sense.    Oh well, that's my frustration for tonight.  Maybe with this easy format to submit entries, I'll update this often.  Who knows.  Oh, and...time for a plug.  If you're in  Monmouth or Ocean county, New Jersey...on Thursdays from 6-9 PM I am on the X, 88.9 FM, Monmouth University's college radio station.  My shows usually range from the "comically awful," to "wow, I think I may have actually made sense for about thirty seconds there."  If you don't live in those counties, you can listen live on the internet by going to www.wmcx.com or by clicking on the link over there.  That's all for now, take care.  I will update again later this week, as needed.

      I haven't posted an update in ten days!  God, I'm lazy.  Let's see...    My cat is dying. This kind of sucks hard. Little Girl has been a part of my family since I was six or seven years old. She's been with us as long as I can remember. She's over twenty years old, and this is probably to be expected...still, I hate seeing her in pain, but I don't want to see her go. I'll miss petting her, scratching behind her ear when she's looking for affection. I'll even miss when she jumps on my lap when I'm not expecting it and rips up a new pair of shorts I'm wearing. It will be hard adjusting to life without her. I'm not normally a spiritual person, but I hope for her sake that if there is such a thing as an afterlife, that she's well taken care of. If there isn't, then I can only hope to provide her last moments of life on this Earth with as much love and care as I possibly can.    Okay, that's our sentimental portion of today's blog update.  Now, on to other updates.    Still haven't gotten my paper back in Senior Seminar, meaning I'll have only a week to rewrite. This is bad, because my paper is a steaming pile of shit (unless Professor Schmidt happens to be reading this. In that case, it's the greatest paper of all time). Today I handed in a portfolio that was only slightly better. The work inside the portfolio was top notch. My resume is damn sharp, and when I get done with my page update, I'm going to post it on there for one and all to see, because it is a work of art. And I designed it! Me, mister no artistic vision whatsoever, made a damn beautiful resume. Unfortunately, the work around the resume was just kind of haphazardously thrown in there. One out of my three references wasn't asked recently to be a reference (unless Dr. Schmidt is reading this, in that case...every reference was asked and checked and there are no problems to report!). Now coming up we have to do a final presentation of everything we've learned in our years at Monmouth. This should be interesting, because we're supposed to be split up into groups, and I don't know who is in my group, because I missed class today. Note to self...don't miss class during introduction of group members. I'm sure this will resolve itself, because I'm the master of landing on my feet in situations similar to this.    My radio show is going well. So far, I haven't been thrown off the air. That's a plus. My Thursday shift has been concentrating more about talking about music of late, because none of my friends listen to this shift, so I make an attempt to actually keep the listeners who tune in. And finally, we got the Sunday situation figured out. I finally ran into the WMCX PD today, and he said he'd make sure I'm on the list this week and in future weeks so I can do my show from the WMCX studios on the campus of Monmouth University. Yay. I really do enjoy doing these shows, it's one of my highlights of the week. Editing my tapes down to only five minutes or so will be tough, but I think I can get some good stuff on there. And please, if you have the ability to listen, go to the link above and listen to my shows Thursday from 12-3 and Sunday from 3-6.    Let's see, what else...the Nets ripped my heart out. Fucking Bruce Ratner. 40% of a starting lineup that went to the fucking finals two out of the last three years...gone. Fuck you, Ratner. John Franco sucks. Hang it up, old man. You've got nothing left but your pride, and with every despicable outing you throw, you lose a piece of that too. Wiggy might be traded...that would also ruin my day. Ty Wigginton is my favourite Mets player, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. If he goes to the Pirates, I will not be amused. I think those are my sports beefs this week.    Things are also shaping up for my graduation party. The invites have been sent out, and most of the people I'd expect to be there have said that they can make it. Hopefully, I'll hear from a few others as well. This is going to be a good ol' time. I've never had anything thrown in my honour before, mostly because I've never done anything honourable. Graduating college in seven years still doesn't seem very honourable to me, but it should still be an awesome time. The party will be at my aunt and uncle's, so there will be plenty of room to commisserate, play games, some swimming...even for Joe's planned Commencement Ceremony, to take place in my aunt's backyard. I can hardly wait.    Maybe the reason I don't update this so much is because I put too much in one update! I'm going to try to make some shorter updates more often. In the meantime, please leave feedback so I know people read this. My cat is crying, so I'm gonna go make sure she's okay. In the meantime, you take care, youngster.

      Of course, by "y'all," I mean "nobody," as in "nobody reads this."  Nobody left any feedback for me as far as Saturday night ideas go, so I wound up going to the ROH show by myself.  At the risk of sounding like an ROH fanboy (which I am not, though I do enjoy watching some of their product) I really enjoyed the main show.  Doug Williams is a fantastic wrestler, and really needs to get his due.  His matches, first the four way match with Jay Lethal, John Walters, and Nigel McGuinness, then the Pure Wrestling title match later in the show with Alex Shelley, were both fantastic.  I really liked his exchanges with Nigel.  Since they both work British style, it looks so much different from the styles that everybody else wrestles that it looks unique and is fun to watch.  Certainly it's better than watching everybody work WWE style in that company, not that the style doesn't have its strong points, but when everybody wrestles the same style, it gets kind of boring after a while, not to mention the fact that some people aren't as good working that style as they would be another style.  Then you have people like Randy Orton, who would suck no matter what style they work.  :)   (That was a shout out to my man Jeff, who isn't reading this, because he hasn't read any of these blog items, but he loves Randy Orton for some reason even though he sucks).    So that was what I did on Saturday.  What else have I done lately?  Well, I was supposed to audition for Who Wants to be a Millionaire tomorrow, but they never sent me the paperwork so I'm not going to bother.  I'll probably hang out with Jeff at his apartment instead.  I bought him an Andy Pettitte action figure in between shows on Saturday at the Toys R Us, so he has that to look forward to.  School is fairly easy this week, as all I have is a brief meeting with my professor sometime Thursday afternoon, then I do my show from 12-3 PM EST.  Then I go home and I'll be home in time for dinner, which will be nice.  I work four days this week, as I'm going broke and need the money.  If anybody wants to give me money, feel free.    Also my parents and I have been planning my graduation party.  They're assuming I'm going to graduate in August (as am I, I would be shocked at this point if I didn't).  Just the usual stuff, inviting friends and family, planning out what to eat.  As long as I have burgers, my dad's sausage and peppers, my mom's potato salad, some shrimp, and a good dessert, I'll be happy.  I'm easy to please, what can I say.  Anyway, that's all for now.  Look for an update and a slight overhaul to the main Cox's Corner page at www.coxscorner.org soon, perhaps tomorrow.  I want to add some things to the layout, perhaps move some things around, make it more interesting.  We'll see what happens.

      And that doesn't make me a bad person.  No, things have been not a lot hectic, just a little hectic.  Last week, I had a twelve page paper due for my one summer class.  I have no doubt in my mind that it sucked, but I have the option to rewrite it, and I will do so.  I was just trying to get it complete instead of putting forth my best possible effort, knowing I'd be given a rewrite option, so I didn't give it the full college try (which you think I would, considering I'm in college and all, but...that's another story).  I've had my radio show, which has had its ups and downs.  We had Grim in studio two weeks ago, and he added a different dimension that the show didn't have before.  We'll see if he makes any other appearances.  I'd wager he would, but he didn't make it last week and I've been unable to contact him for this week, so we'll see.  By the way, if you read this and want to listen, my timeslot was moved to 12-3 on Thursdays.  In addition, I have added a Sunday shift as well from 3-6 PM, if I can get access to the building this week.  Last week, I went to do my show and couldn't get into the building.  Not having been given instructions on how to get in when the building is closed, I didn't know what to do so I went home.  Hopefully, we'll have that issue cleared up for this weekend.  Let's see, what else...my 4th of July weekend kinda sucked.  I didn't do anything.  I've been working some.  Work hasn't gotten much better, but I'm kind of learning to deal with it.  Other than the paper and the radio show, nothing of importance to note about school.  Home life has been weird.  My dad has been having issues of late.  I hope he isn't drinking again, but I'm not so sure.  For some reason, he isn't home tonight.  I just got home from work, so I have no idea if he and my mom had a fight or whatever, but he definitely is not home.  Before I left for work, he was ragging about this and that.  I think he might have started drinking frequently again, but I can't prove it.  I really hope I'm wrong.  Weekend plans?  I'm trying to talk Jeff into going to the Ring of Honor show in Elizabeth, but I'm not sure he's buying that.  Grim probably won't go either, so I wouldn't be surprised if I went by myself.  Ugh.  Going to independent wrestling shows on a Saturday night by yourself = Bad.  Going to ROH shows, with ROH fans filling the building pretending matches are Match of the Year candidates when they clearly aren't by yourself = Really bad.  Still, I have nothing else to do, and I don't want to spend it at home, and Jeff wants to go to 3PW, and they suck, so ROH is likely what is in store for me.  May God have mercy on my soul.  That's all for now.  Nobody left any feedback for the last blog item, so I'm assuming that I'm writing these all for myself.  I can deal with that.  That means I can bury more people.  But I will ask this in my blog tonight.  Can anybody think of a more constructive way for me to spend my Saturday evening, keeping in mind that most of my friends will likely not want to do anything and that no matter what, I'm spending it by myself?  If you can and I like the idea, I may just use it and give you credit in the next blog update.  But I doubt anybody will respond to this, so...touche.  Word out.

      Well, my 25th birthday has ended.  I'd say I had a fun day.  It started at my friend Joe's house, where we got Subway and Coldstone Creamery ice cream (my GOD, is that stuff friggin' awesome), then sat around and played video games.  After that, I drove over to my friend Travis', where we went to Friendly's for dinner and had more ice cream.  I am a fat, fat man on this day.  After which, we watched a few innings of the Mets game, then I left him so he could pack (he's going away on a trip on Sunday), so I went over to my friend Jeff's house, where I dropped off McFarlane figures for him and we watched part of the opening ceremonies of the two week celebration of my birthday, aka the Olympics.  I spent most of the day out doing things, which was a nice change of pace from what I normally do, which is nothing.  Most of those things were eating, and right now, I am feeling severely overweight.  If I was the type to exercise, I would be spending an extra twenty minutes on the treadmill or stationary bike tomorrow, but alas.  Instead, I'll be working.  It's been nice to be away from work for three days, but I'm broke, so...oh well.  I finished school on Thursday, too, making this a great week.  I got an A on my portfolio, then stood up and pretended I was part of a group presentation on how to produce a radio commercial.  I've never really found myself to be the teaching type, so I kind of stood in the background and made wry observations every now and then.  I managed to get an A for Senior Seminar, which leads me to believe that Professor Schmidt was taking this class about as seriously as I was.  Thus ends my return to Monmouth, which has to be considered a total success.  I started there in Fall of '97, and went there for two years.  A D in psychology caused me to lose my academic scholarship, since i needed to maintain a 3.0 GPA (and my GPA topped out at 2.95), so I went to TCNJ.  I failed out of there because I was burned out.  After a year off and a year at a local community college, I went back to Monmouth, where I wound up with six A's, an A-, four B+'s, and a B-.  Not too bad, considering how lousy things had been for me at TCNJ.  Now, with the schooling out of the way, comes the hard part:  finding a job in the radio industry, and not in the pizza industry.  I'm working on that one.  Two weeks from my graduation party, and I can't wait.  I've never even had so much as a birthday party before, so it's exciting to have something in my honour.  It should be a fun time, and another excuse to eat like a slovenly beast of a man.  More updates to come, so keep it here, yo.  And through August, you can still listen to my radio show at www.wmcx.com on Thursdays from 12-3 and Sundays from 3-6, so please tune in and send me feedback.

      Word.  Not a lot to report this week.  I got my paper back in Seminar, and I got a 95.  I didn't expect that.  I think the reason I got a good grade is because my teacher didn't feel like grading rewrites.  Seriously.  Everybody in the class seemed to get an A or a B on the paper.  Oh well, I'm not going to complain.  An A is an A.  Even if I gave a C effort on it, I'll take the A.  Let's see, what else...Little Girl is still wildly missed.  It's the weird times where I miss her, like when I'm grabbing a cucumber out of the refridgerator, I almost expect her to come limping by to say hello.  It's weird, how I notice the little things.  My parents are talking of getting another pet, which is an about face to how they have felt over the years.  It used to be that whenever Little Girl left us, we'd have no more pets, but I guess they realise how much they miss having a pet in the house.  They are worried, though, that if we get another cat, it will run out into the street.  See, Big Guy (our old cat) and Little Girl used to run out into the street a lot.  Big Guy got hit by a car and unfortunately died.  Little Girl got hit by a car, hid in the woods for two or three weeks, then came back one day limping like crazy with a hunk of skin missing from her leg.  While she eventually nursed herself back to health (because she was a tough cat), she never played in the street again.  My parents are afraid that if we do get another pet, the only way it will learn not to play in the street is if it gets hurt, and they don't want that to happen.  So we'll see.  On the social front, nothing new to talk about.  I still don't really hear from Grim too often anymore.  I'm beginning to think I'm probably not going to see him too much anymore.  This Friday is my birthday, and I'm going to spend it hanging with my friend Travis and maybe my friend Joe.  Hopefully not too many alcoholic drinks will be consumed.  :)  Then in just over two weeks,  my graduation party will be the end of summer.  It's weird.  Normally, the end of summer has meant the beginning of school.  This year, the end of summer will be the end of school.  And I mean, the end.  I'm graduating.  It's weird, though I am considering grad school.  We shall see.  And that does it for this update.  Please tune in to www.wmcx.com on Thursday from 12-3 PM and Sunday from 3-6 PM for my radio show, and other than that, take care, whomever you are.  Even if Tanya is still the only person reading this.  :)

      I'm going to ask Blogger if I have the least visited blog in the history of existance.  I don't think anybody ever goes here.  But I post for you anyway.  Even if you don't exist.  Maybe you is me.  I dunno.  Today's update:  Little Girl is still wildly missed around the house.  She was in her own way such an important part of the house, and I really miss her a lot.  It's not the same without her.  It's difficult adjusting when something has been a part of your life for almost twenty years, and all of a sudden it's just...gone.  And not coming back.  Divorce must be ten times worse.  I'm never getting divorced.  Children leaving the house or dying must be a hundred times worse.  I'm never having kids.  Then again, sometimes I think those things aren't happening whether I want them to or not...  Anyway, other things.  The Benson and Zambrano trades are looking like unmigated disasters.  Bruce Ratner is still a douchebag.  I hope David Stern makes him sell the team back.  Work still sucks, but hopefully I only have a few more weeks of working at Domino's.  Radio show went well today.  Hopefully we can get some guests in there so I can interact with somebody.   With me being unable to take phone calls, I think it really takes away from the atmosphere of trying to do a talk radio program.  I, Robot was pretty good.  Harold and Kumar was pretty mediocre.  And I think that will do it.  Take care, invisible blog reader.
