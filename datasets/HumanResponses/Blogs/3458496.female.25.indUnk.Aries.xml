      Tahimik akong naglalakad sa magulong kalye ng Recto Av. Magpapa-print ako sa may R. Papa, mura  don, tatlong piso lang, limang piso pag laser print.           Dumaan muna ako ng Deovir, tumingin ako ng brush at pintura. Papasok  pa lang ako ng Deovir, may tumawag,  ‘Neng!’ , dalawang beses. Hindi ako lumingon kasi inisip ko yung batang nagtitinda ng yosi at kendi ang tinutukoy. Nang sumunod na tawag ng parehong boses,  ‘Oi, EIC, suplada mo na a!'  Lumingon na’ko, kilala ko yung tumawag pero di ko matandaan yung pangalan. Wala akong ibang masabi kundi,  ’O, Druglord, kamusta na?’  EIC tawag nya sa’ken, Druglord tawag ko sa kanya no’n. Kahuntahan nung College, estudyante ng EE.          Hindi ko pa rin maalala yung pangalan, kaya sa bi ko na lang,  ’Balita ko, Engineer ka na daw, tapos sampu na yung anak!’  Sagot nya,  ’Grabe ka naman, on the way pa lang GF ko e…’  Tawanan na naman, gaya ng dati, batian at biruan sa hallway, hiraman ng libro…. Nagpasama siya kasi bibili daw siya ng Baby Book. Ayos, mahaba-habang kwentuhan habang umiinom ako ng Kolera juice  (gulaman).            Naka-uwi na’ko, pero di ko pa rin matandaan pangalan nya.  Putsa! Basta, Druglord…            Bigla kong naalala yung tropa nung college. Hindi na rin nagkikita-kita. Buti na lang uso na ang fone. Naalala ko rin yung tropang laging kasabay pag-uwi, maghahabol sa last trip ng tren , kadugasan sa pagkain ng tuknene, kainuman ng beer habang nag-uusap tungkol sa kalakaran ng mundo, kung bakit ayaw mapasama sa corporate world pero parang alang choice, mga tanong na nakaka-asar itanong at sagutin. Minsan may nagtanong kung magka-relasyon kami (yung tipo ng primitibong tao na pag nakakita ng babae’t lalakeng magkasama, sila na) Sabay kaming tumawa ng malakas. Walang ganu’ng spark e. Nung huli kaming magkita sa kasal ng tropa namin, ang daming kwento. Kaso, sayang, bitin sa oras. Syempre hatid pa niya GF niya sa kanila. Tsk, kailan kaya mauulit mga usapang tungkol sa kalakaran ng mundo, mga tanong na nakaka-asar itanong at sagutin, mga pagbabago at nangyayari sa isa’t isa, at marami pang iba……kasabay ang bote ng beer….. habang si Bob ang nasa background.

       waiting till the clock strikes 12    I could not seem to write anything but these...........     It had been long since the last rainfall The ground is now arid.  Aridness that parched deep within the soul.  Succumbing thyself into oblivion, Lest that the longing see through 	 The hollow eyes, 	The wanting mind.     Ebb of tide… transient stillness of the sea…  Soft breeze blowing the locks…  Pensive thoughts…  Masked the turmoil that lies beneath.     Come, let us once again lie ‘neath the clouds, Gaze amid the vast blue	 Until we feel like were among them.   Come, let me take you to my place, Know the details in my case Until we wallow in the silence that surrounds.  Come, let us find our dwelling To the humdrum of our paltry  existence Until we finally found what it means to be ‘us’.

       Unaware of time Chewing a gum that had been in my mouth for the nth time    Late last week, I went to check a weekend sale in a local mall in Alabang. Footcha! I was so pleased, nyak, nyak, nyak. Would you believe, I bought a Chuck Taylor (in a Converse shop) for only 150 PhP, and a Converse bag also for 150 PhP.  Sana parating 70% off.  Hay, sometimes, there’s a lot of good things in life.  	I’m never really particular about buying things with a brand. I don’t care much about it, especially on apparels. I could not understand why a simple T-shirt, sometimes with stupid logos and not-so-funny-trying-to-be-funny design, could cost up to 300+ bucks. I don’t think that’s reasonable.

      Why would I want to write? It’s probably the most asked question in my entirely hapless existence. At the dead of the night, oftentimes, this question raps up my scarcely filled brain and I’d end up staring a blank ceiling. I kept asking this question, and in due course, I’d feel utterly absurd until I turned soporic and succumb into the clutches of Hymnos. 	I never thought of becoming a writer in my pre-school days  (in fact, I never thought of becoming anything at all) . Although I learned how to read before entering kindergarten, writing a book of my own never crossed my mind. However, I’m always fascinated with people who got a facility with words and how they could create a wonderful story by merely putting words together.  The first book that I read was “Ang Nahihimbing na Kagandahan” ( Sleeping Beauty’s Tagalog version)  and then seconded by “The Princess and the Pea”, which my mother bought and thought it was apt for her daughters. Even if I didn’t like these stories  (as it didn’t have much action and fantasy),  I started looking for other books (with awesome illustrations) and reading them. Back then, I took a greater interest on the drawings, I even got hooked on comics  (until now),  consequently I view writing at a distance. 	My first literary experience was on the last year of elementary. I made a four-versed poem, fortunately it got published on the yearly paper. Right then I took writing into consideration. I started reading biographies of different writers, and much to my dismay, I got discourage and somewhat afraid. Almost all writers started writing at a very early age, 5 or 6, some even started at 4. And to most, writing runs in their blood. Others have a wide aptitude in constructing fine plots. A lot entered premier literature academies. Aside from these, writing is tedious and requires plenty of discipline  (which is way out of my vocabulary),  intensive research that is time and energy consuming. And, writing is something you can work for a year or more without the assurance that you’ll get paid. With these and a lot other reasons, I drifted away from writing. I thought I could never write.          But it all comes back. I’d still ask the same stupid question, and then, I’d still keep on doing it.          Okay. Maybe I’m not good at it. I don’t have a wide range of vocabulary. My grammar is sometimes questionable. I didn’t have even a single book published, yet. I never took any Language courses, or I lack of technical skills. But still, the craving to write never falters. My desire to seem clever ceased long ago; I learned that it made me all the more foolish. In the U.S. alone, only about 200 writers, out of the thousands do get a living out of writing, so I cognize that writing is never synonymous to getting rich, except when your King, Cromwell, or Clancy. Writing may not seem to be a profitable profession so why the hell do I want to pursue it? Well, simply, because I wanted it.  I may still not be good at it, but writing is a continuous process of learning. You become skilled along the way. It’s not something that comes in an instant  (you’re lucky if it does).

      groggy.. ....and feeling sorry for my breath   Saturday. I woke up at around 1 o’clock in the afternoon. I’m still hesitant to get up, but I’m soaking with sweat. Lest that I catch pneumonia, I dragged my lazy bones up and head to the bathroom. Man, I felt like I’m one somnambulist. ( With in minutes, my cranium would burst, and guts would splatter all around this four-cornered room…)  I’m suffering from a terrible pain in my head, I could not move. 	This recurring post-slumber syndrome is common, especially when I end up sleeping at 6 in the morning, or when the sun starts to kiss the sky. The throbbing in my head would cease just after minutes of not moving. I get along with it. 	I do not have a normal sleeping habit. My possible earliest sleep would be about 1 am  (if I’m lucky) , the clutches of Hymnos would embrace me by 3 am  (most normal) . But I would be in trouble if past 4 am and still distant from a somniferous state. I’ve acquired sleeping late since my senior year in high school. I got zealous watching Eon Flux, The Maxx, and Dead at 21, or sometimes, American Gothic  (I like Caleb’s accent) . Or maybe from drinking too much coffee, from time to time, I would drink languidly, unaware till it’s my 8th cup for the day. Geez, but I’ve read that drinking too much coffee aids in forming glaucoma, so I’ve toned it down a bit. Still, there’s something in coffee’s nigritude and acridity that got me hooked. On occasion, I could not sleep if I haven’t drink coffee yet. 	As a late-sleeper, I would advice not to sleep late, nor drink coffee more than a cup a day. It is very unhealthy. Instead of coffee, drink lots and lots of water. If you’d sleep late, you’d wake up late and miss the morning wonders, so put on the sack not later than 10 o’clock. Well, there’s nothing to do with a good advice but to pass it on. That’s what I’m doing. 	I could not sleep early, because I really don’t want to. I’m much more alive in the dead of the night. I’m not a scion of Count Dracula or something; I just love doing my stuff in the night. It’s quite odd though, I love the nighttime, but I hate going out. Discos and barhops are not my thing. I just love to stay in my room. And do a lot of bits and pieces or watch tv.

       just got home tired late afternoon   Unable to do my scheduled task, I got stuck into a bookstore where I could read profusely. I comfortably sit in a somewhat comfortable sitting area, with two people in my left, who happen to be lovers. 	I transpired to be reading a novel, ‘Rolling the R’s’, written by a great author whom I forgot the name.  ( What a shame!)   It’s on the tip of my tongue. Why in the world did I forget his name when I’m decided to look for his other works? He’s really good, by the way, he’s also local, but residing in New York, ata. I’ll check on these again. I certainly recommend the book. It’s about Filipino immigrants in Hawaii back in the 70’s. It embarks upon love and relationships, gay and straight. Katrina-trina, Edgar, Vicente, Florante are one of the protagonists. They’re friends, Edgar is a self-confessed homo (confirmed since he saw his Dad butt-naked inside their bathroom on his third grade years) concurrently, Vicente and Florante are the closeted type. Umm… enough of this, before I get carried away, and make a whole review. It’s a good read, talaga! While I’m contented reading, the two people beside me were quite making a scene ( although not a big one ). They’re baby talking and smooching  (quite)  one another, oblivious of my presence. I don’t know why I took notice of them, when I, usually, don’t care. Is it because of what I’m reading? Or is it just me? Maybe I’m being envious they have each other and I’m by myself? (Huh?) I read a line in the book, ‘.. love don’t last …’ Really? Then why the hell, for almost two years, I could not forget about the one person I ever got involved with in my life. Then, I’m thinking, ‘what if, I become sweet, would he stay? ‘what if…blah, blah, blah. There’s a lot of what if’s. I kept thinking it was my fault. Kept asking why does a good start comes to a bitter end.  (nyaai! kinikilabutan na’ko.)  Ha, one could really not avoid the clutches of being baduy, and thinking baduy, even once in its pathetic existence. Hay, you really had to go through a lot in this life. Sometimes, you believe in things that aren’t true. But you’ll soon forget, everything passes.  I just wish I could forget about it tomorrow…

       Some time past midnight with my usual mug of coffee almost dead silent    It started when I received e-mail from my friend, a forwarded message with “Hate Letter for Pinoys”, as the title. Written by some Art dunno-what’s-his-last-name ( wouldn’t care to know either ). 	At first, I didn’t read it. So what? Hate letters are always done by bitter and stuck-up individuals. To hide their bitterness and failure, they’d talk unpleasant about other people. (Ha!) 	When I ran out of messages to read (and delete), I finally read the  ‘hate letter’ . I couldn’t help but put a little laugh, smirk and be so da”#?!&d pissed! Heck! I could, in a way, congratulate this Art guy, for being successful in pissing a lot of us, Filipinos. 	However, I still kept on reading ( talk of irating one’s self!).  It would do me no good, I know. It’s a waste of time,  I KNOOW!   But I would still want to know what this guy is talking about. I read till the last lines ”…..   Can you demonstrate how you use Confucianism or Taoism in your everyday life?? You can't. And you will NEVER be able to. I understand that you are trying to create an identity for yourselves as young people... but it is NOT related to Asia. Your Identity is Filipino. That's all you are. Just Filipino. Think about what that means....   “  I went silent for a moment, and it got me thinking. 	This Art guy talks trash about Filipinos because he is just trash himself. A simpleton who thinks of himself as a ‘great one’. Pity. I’d proudly be a FILIPINO than be an inch like him. 	We belong in a Third World Country. I never discount this fact. We have a lot of Entertainers in Japan or in any part of the world, and so? No one’s in a place to judge these people, they’re working their butts out to take care of their families. Let them work their own way. Yes, we’re ‘third world’, but we’re not filthy. Maybe, some lack discipline, but it does not comprise the whole of Filipinos. Things have bad and good sides, same as Americans, Chinese, or Koreans, and so on. One hasn’t got the right to criticize when one does not fully understand. 	Why does this imperceptive letter affect me? Well, BECAUSE I AM A FILIPINO! No one, no, NO ONE got the right to insult my being Filipino. A Filipino can do well, same as any individual of any race can. 	But it’s good to know that a lot felt the same way I did, and still proud to be what they are. That is FILIPINO.

      Humour me with thoughts from your mind. Let me laugh till my breath ran out Or tickle my body until it self-destruct… At least I had died laughing.  Shots of pain throb through my head. It lingers, the pain gets normal. If it subsided, I came looking out for it Strange? Yes. You get numb, I guess.  You came searching for life’s answers,	 Odd thing is, you didn’t even know the question. You’re trying to figure out the next step, Alas, you haven’t even started yet.  Life is a big contradiction. Even that, you can contradict about… There is so much that you must bear. Or else, you lose and lead life to despair. 			---at random---

              It is raining hard. Seems like the raindrops could leave a hole on your skin. Thunder roared raucously. It was almost deafening.         I sat in the dim of my room, forbidding myself to go and play outside the rain. I kept myself busy. Pretending to do a lot of things. It rained harder.          The orchestral sound the rain makes is very much inviting. Tempting you to get sodden at the downpour. I could not resist…. I had to.         The driving rain felt good on your face. Feels like the old times. I wish I could get back.
