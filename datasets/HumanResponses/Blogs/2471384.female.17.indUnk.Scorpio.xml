      Here I am, writing an overdue blog post. Well my own site hasn't been updated for like erm fiften-leven days. Thats a good sign though, cause if I'm blogging everyday..it means my life is dead! more specific, i'm always staying at home facing the com.Well that was the reason I created my blog few weeks ago because I was dead bored that time.ahhAah okay a quick update on myself. I have another 1 month till college starts.So what I'm doing everyday now? My life is totally on the reversed. I sleep at 6am everyday[roughly la] and wakes up late afternoon..sometimes I just eat D`branch [breakfast + lunch + dinner] Now my activities just got started :p usually i'll watch the chinese drama on Astro 30 till 10.30 before calling my frens and join them. We usually lepakz till like 2 something before decidin where to go watch football! Then we'll chillout till ususally 5 something before going back.That cycle repeats everyday! So basically its a routine!  Let's get back to business, where's the Starlight Cinema thing?Gone by the wind I suppose :P and miss jukumitz, I think yer shall go and consult doctor bout yer lil tummy. Don't delay anythin like that. Get someone to go along with you. I can fetch! :p Whats up with me and han yang? "we're just what we are". ahhahaa we aint changed much mmkayz. Still here anytime, just that our daily lifes aren't the same any longer. Haven't see karen n jewlie for ages actually.Weng Lum...I talk to him often. miracles! Kenny I've seen you at basketball.While the rest?I alwayz see you guys online..so do you too huh?! :p Thats all for now.Be lucky you get to read my post.Doesn't alwayz come out any longer or often too..its special.yak yak yak! peace out from me! fooked me!

      [IF]    If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too, If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream--and not make dreams your master, If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much, If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!   --Rudyard Kipling

      Okay I've just worked out a solution for the highlighting problem. You can highlight them and if you would like to quote them. Just highlight then press ctrl + C. Your quoting will be copied automatically.  Been online for quite sometime now.My new best record was 12 hours straight non-stop which is yesterday. Well don't ask me how I survived it, have no idea too!hehehe

      bet u guys read this sometimes b4. some of u might just recieve it. well i did some adjustments to it as to show my  sincerity  and  honesty  =). the  itallic  words are my remarks  Somewhere between the *procrastination* and the homework..  this i gotta agree   And the incessant forwards and the friendships and the calls  to each other complaining about CrUsHeS and BF/GF!!   Somewhere between the phone calls to old friends and the "I miss you's", the "I love you's" and the "What are we doing tonight's?"   And somewhere between all of the changing and growing... somewhere between the classes and the skipping classes...and the StUdYiNg for teStS...And the PRETENDING to "StUdY" for TeStS...And the downright NOT StUdYiNg for TeStS...( hell yeah! ) I forgot--I forgot what ScHooL was all about.    Somewhere between all the appointments, starbucks coffee,  and Mc Donald's... paying bills and then not paying bills... Making plans then breaking plans...  Appearing, Disappearing, then reappearing...  I forgot--I forgot what it was like to cry.   I forgot that pretending to be happy doesn't make you  happy...  And that pretending to be SmArT doesn't make you smart ..  I forgot that you can't just forget the past in fear of the FUTURE...  I forgot that you can't control falling in LoVe..  And that you can't make yourself fall in *LoVe*....   I learned that I can LOVE...I learned that it's okay to MEsS UP....  And it's okay to ask for HELP!!!..  And it's okay to feel like crap... ( yea i bet everyone does once in a while )  I learned it's okay to cOmPLaiN and wHINe to all your friends for a whole day........ ( thanks ju and lyn !!)  I learned that sometimes the things you want most you just can't have and the things that you look for are right in front of you.  I learned that the greatest thing about HiGh ScHOoL and CoLLeGe and the working world it isn't about the parties or the  DRiNKiNG or the Hookups ... ( er...not so sure bout drinking and hookups but definitely the parties...not forgetting get togethers with you guys after a period of time has passed and everyone has led their own lives differently for a while...yea...)   It's the *FrIeNdShIpS*, which means taking chances.   I learned that sometimes the things we want to forget are the things which we most need to talk about...   I learned that TIME and LOVE can heal all things...  I learned that just when you think it can't get worse - it does! ... ( gawd tell me about it man !) but with the love and support of friends - you survive...   I've learned that when you start feeling BaD abou t L O S I N G touch and about those that you've lost! They too, are feeling the same way....  I learned that letters from friends are the most important things.  And that sending cards to your friends makes you feel better! But, basically, I just learned that my friends........  Both old and new.....and my family...are the most important people to me in the world AND.......  without them, I wouldn't be who I am today .....   So this is a  THANK YOU  to all of my friends...  For always being there. And even if we're not on good terms or we have lost touch... I will always have an unconditional love for you.. ~Always and forever ~  so thanks...kam siah....xie xie...toh che...mm koi...terima kasih...=)

      think i shall proclaim  Outkast  as my new fav band. never fails to bop my head up and down...=)  today, as expected, i was all gloomy in class coz of last night's phone conversation. sigh...sux to realise what great effects a guy can have on a girl that likes him. wonder if a girl can have the same effect on a guy that likes her? all muh dear guy buddies in this blog care to clear my doubts? hehe  Woke up late this morning. had no time for contact lenses, hair styling, and breakfast. thank God thursday's break is at 10-11 so didnt' have to starve myself much. today Mr Chin broke the record by calling my name  3  times in class! ( usually it's just once a day ) but he doesn't irritate me much, dunno why. Mr Yap irritates me more. haha...tell u all also no use. =)  okla. yao sui jiao liao. chai chien

      Erm ok one more post b4 i retire ... talking to a friend made me realise my friend base is not that wide after all ... my current friends are cool but i've always thought that having more friends who actually acknowledge you (as in talk to u normally not like ur some stranger) would be great... lets just say i know them n our conversations nvr venture of hi's and bye's ... hey saying this .. some of my considered closer friends talk like that too ... hmmm  something to ponder bout tonight well looks like this will be all for tonight another post another time! adioz amigos ! chalos mi amour si carina ..

      woh...for how long have u had this up?? haha pretty cool...but coffee n cream!?!? ahahha  today...i'm trying my best to enjoy every last second of my hols...come 7 am tmr i'll be jumping up to the sound of my alarm clock, getting ready for the gloom of college life once again. JoY!  *sarcasm practically drips from my words*   Then again, my mind isn't really enjoying every bit of it. Somehow or another i'm squirming in my seat thinking of things that i missed out...like homework, assignments, Leo stuff even...oh well, once a student always a student!  The fact that pacesetters got cancelled did  not  help. thought i could clear my mind and tire myself out the last time b4 the college life starts again. sigh...jus the thought of the dull lethargy is enough to make me flip with excitement! (again, i'm being sarcastic...)  ok...r3n signing off...=)

      Once you hit 40, it is time to think twice about miniskirts. Also, string bikinis, midriff-baring tops, skintight or low-rise jeans that have been sanded white the length of the thighs, as though the wearer had been tied to a bumper and dragged facedown around the block a few times. These are clothes for young people.   Alas, this is what the stores are selling. Today's popular clothing chains appeal strictly to teenagers, who can be counted upon to change their tastes every 30 days, as the latest Cosmo Girl or Teen Vogue arrives in the mail. Customers like me cannot possibly afford new clothing more than once a decade, owing to the financial strain of paying for teenage children's rapidly shifting fashion needs. So no one bothers to make clothing for us.   This is a dangerous situation. Expose a middle-aged woman to nothing but miniskirts and abbreviated tops for long enough, and she's bound to cave. One day, when her self-esteem is dangerously high and the dressing room lights dangerously low, she'll try on something designed for her daughter and say to herself, "Oh, why not?" If she happens to be shopping with her children, the answer to this question will be provided for her. But middle-aged husbands offer no such reality check. They live in a candyland of denial and residual carnality. They still, bless them, like to see a little flesh.   My husband recently made me try on a bikini. A bikini is not so much a garment as a cloth-based reminder that your parts have been migrating all these years. My waist, I realized that day in the dressing room, has completely disappeared beneath my rib cage, which now rests directly on my hips. I'm exhibiting continental drift in reverse. The buttocks, too, have overrun their boundaries, infringing on territory that rightly belongs to the thighs. I have encouraged my thighs to do something about this -- restraining order, guard dog -- but they have not. Your thighs are rarely there for you.   "Cute!" says Ed dementedly. "Turn around."   "You turn around first."   Ed does not understand what all women my age understand. The mature lady's buttock does not wish to come out and take a bow. Designers of mature ladies' swimwear know this. They've built little curtains into their designs, enabling the sagging buttock to keep hidden, and/or cast votes in privacy. God help me, I've entered the Age of Skirted Swimwear. This is the age right after Accessorizing with Reading Glasses and a few years before Can't Name Anyone on the Radio.  Even the knees are in on the betrayal. I recently saw a tabloid photograph of a 40-something Demi Moore with her knees circled in red, highlighting the fact that they were disappearing under the shifting shoals of her thighs. Ha-ha, I said to myself. Just deserts for having a face and breasts (and a boyfriend) that look 25. Then I looked at my own knees, which I plan never to do again.   The foot is more or less the one body part that time leaves alone. Well into your 70s, you can wear whatever style shoes you feel like wearing. Positioned, as they are, at the bottom of the heap, gravity is not an issue. Or so I thought. Shortly after the swimsuit debacle, I tried on a pair of pointy-toed black pumps, the sort that actresses on "Sex and the City" were wearing for 30 days back in spring.   "How do those work for you?" the salesgirl asked. I told her they were pinching me, and not in an appreciative, you-look-just-like-that-gal-on- "Sex and the City" way.  "You know," she said brightly, "your feet flatten as you age."   I went to find Ed, and I told him about my flattening instep. He smiled and put his arm around me. That still fits, and for this I'm happy.

      You know I think this is a very smart idea. ahhah It only proves to show how immature guys can get and, even with something to  aim  with, can still miss. haha...    This is cool too.   Concentrate on the small 4 black dots arranged vertically. Look at it for like 20 seconds. Then after that close your eyes and face in the direction of your room light. haha tell me what you see k? =)
