      Have you ever wondered where your favorite actors are, or what they are doing when they are in between movies?  Perhaps they are shopping around for Oscar-winning scripts, perhaps they are honing their art, or perhaps, they just might be in Japan making ridiculous ads.   urlLink Japander  is a site where you can download a whole bunch of Japanese ads by American celebrities -- which are usually very comical (read: embarrassing).  From  urlLink Gabrielle Anwar  to  urlLink ZZ Top , nobody is too high profile to peddle their act in the Land of the Rising Sun.  Whether it's Nicholas Cage's  urlLink morbid obsession/addiction to pachinko machines  or Arnold Schwarzenegger's  urlLink wild-eyed, psychotic promotion of Arinamin V, an energy drink with Nicotine , this site is sure to amuse you for many hours.

      Holy crap!  I've been a Dr. Who fan for many years now and since the (lukewarm) Dr. Who movie they put out in 1996, I've been hoping for a comeback for the series.  The problem is, that even if the series makes a comeback, it will be a while before it leaves British shores and makes its way to the US.  Well, not anymore.  Looks like the BBC is created a bunch of Dr. Who episodes in Flash.  New episodes are supposed to air every Thursday.  This, of course, is dementedly good news...  It certainly made my day :)  urlLink Go see the first episode, the Scream of the Shalka

      Once again, I venture forth in the crazy impersonal world of weblogs.  Yes, I fully expect people will flock to my page because they want to know the latest crap that's on my mind.  Cerebral gems such as "I was picking my nose and I felt my brain today" or "Waah, some jerk cut me off in the highway" or "The newest filk/retro/punk CD from a band you've never heard of that I've been following since 1973 is great!" are sure to await your perusal.  Let's not forget the obligatory political statement like "We anarchists should organize!" or such profound phylosophical musings as "I'm an individual, just like everyone else!"  Either way, enjoy...

      I've been on a Call of Cthulhu/H. P. Lovecraft kick lately.  It's pretty cool stuff actually.  Weird thing is that three years ago, I could not stand reading Lovecraft yet now I can't get enough.  Funny how tastes change.   I've also been messing around with a rotozoomer.  What's that, you say?  You know those funky visualizations that you see in Windows Media Player and WinAmp?  Same thing.  Basically you draw an image (in my case the words "Ia, Ia, Cthulhu Fhtagn" -- told you I was on a Cthulhu kick) then you take that image, rotate it slightly, enlarge it slightly, then draw it onto itself half translucent.  It's called a feedback loop.&nbsp;  If you want to try it out (and you are running Windows), download  urlLink this zip file .&nbsp; Maybe if I get motivated enough I'll turn it into a screensaver.  On the technical side, I'm using  urlLink GapiDraw  to do the graphics.&nbsp; It's wonderful graphics API that can compile for a bunch of handheld devices (Pocket PC, SmartPhone, Symbian 60, Palm) as well as Windows.&nbsp; On the Windows side it basically ends up calling DirectX.&nbsp; I love it.  If you are doing any kind of 2d graphics work, check it out.

      Ah, if Dr. Seuss was Network Wizard, can you imagine then reading his "manuals?"  It took one of those  urlLink geniuses  at  urlLink Cornell  to figure it out.  Credit goes to  urlLink Gene Ziegler  for a really funny piece of art.   Dr. Suess as a Network Wizard    Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say....  If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is interupted as a very last resort, and the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!  If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash, and the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash, and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash, then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gona crash.  You can't say this? What a shame, sir! We'll find you another game, sir.  If the label on the cable on the table at your house says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, but your packets want to tunnel on another protocol, that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall, and your screen is all distorted by the side-effects of gauss, so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse, then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gunna hang!  When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk, and the microcode instructions cause unecessary risc, then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. quickly turn of your computer and be sure to tell your mom!

      I want to take you back to 1997... Yes, I know, any more "historical" posts and this site should be renamed to "Arabundi’s Living in the Past", just bear with me here.  Anyway, back in 1997 or so I became a big fan of Internet Explorer 3.  Sure, it was crappy, it crashed a lot, it was slow, but for some reason I really really liked it.  Kind of like eating bacon, you know it's not healthy for you, but you do it anyway.  In my opinion Netscape 3 was the better browser, so I mainly used that -- however, when no one was looking, I'd take peeks at IE.  Shortly thereafter, IE4 came out and blew everything away.  The fact that Netscape 4 blew chunks, was slow, clunky, etc, didn't help.  IE4 was fast, and shiny, and like everyone else, I signed off my computer's soul in order to use this great browser.  I haven't looked back ever since.  Let's face it.  What competition does IE6 have today?     urlLink Netscape / urlLink Mozilla :  Have you ever tried to use this crap?  It takes until Armageddon to load, it feels slow and clunky.  It's tainted with AOL.    urlLink Opera : Great browser, but I've never seen something that is both speedy and sluggish  at the same time!   It crashes on me all the time and a good chunk of the screen real-estate is used up by the menus, toolbars, tabs, and banner adds.    The problem with IE is that it lacks the better browsing feature of these other two browsers like tabbed browsing and mouse gestures.  Any chance for an IE7?  Probably not until the new version of Windows.  *sigh*  What is one to do?  Someone clued me in to  urlLink Mozilla Firebird .  It's not like the current Mozilla/Netscape client... it's fast, it's sleek, it's streamlined, it loads in nanoseconds, it has tabs that are smarted that Opera's, a whole bunch of useful features like built in Google and popup blockers, and of course, Mouse Gesture (via a plug-in)  I've been using it for a couple of days now and I have to say that I'm amazed.  Even though it's version 0.7, I'm very much tempted to make it default web browser.  Could this spell the beginning of a new browser war?  I can only hope so.

      August 1998: Redmond, Washington.  I cautiously approach an arcade cabinet, its phosphorous glow beckoning me in the darkness of the hallway like a siren’s song.  I run my fingers gingerly over the cabinet and feel the spherical mounds of two trackballs, one red, one blue.      “It has no joystick.”  I was struck.  Sigmund Freud would have said that this arcade machine was a woman among a sea of joystick-ed peers.  I say it is beautiful.  I playfully spin the trackball and a naked Medusa comes on the screen, her snakes playfully hiding the more naughty bits.  “Medusa, you tease.” I say.  It’s been over two months since I last saw my girlfriend, 3000 miles away.  I was lonely.  It’s only cheating if it’s the same species, or so I tell myself.  I fish through my pockets for a quarter while Medusa shows me how she’s trouncing one of the other AIs.  Sweat pours down my brow as I find my pockets empty.  Is my tryst with this digital mythical creature doomed from the start?  I begin to despair, when I notice on the bottom of the screen the world’s two most beautiful words: Free Play.  I press the Player 1 button and I wait in anticipation.  Soon, it will be just the two of us… and a colony of slimes?  Noooo!  I play and defeat the colony of slimes only to be assaulted by a fat hillbilly mutant.  It seems that my Medusa is the third opponent in the game.  I defeat Cletus with hardly any effort.  Nobody will stay between and my five minute imaginary fling.  At last, She arrives.  We start playing.  She quickly dominates the field. “So that’s how you like it?  I can do that baby” I tell her.  I turn the tables on her, I make a comeback but she’s relentless.  More sweat pours down my face, my chest, my hands, on the controls.  Each move changes the game almost completely, each move a note in our symphony.  It is anybody’s game.  Who’s going to go first?  Her or me?  Who’s going to come out on top?  Eventually we are done.  Both of us are spent.  I wish I smoked, because I want to light a cigarette.  I give her one last look and promise I’ll come again tomorrow.  Will I?  You bet.  Fast Forward to today...  I’ve been infatuated with the game Ataxx for a very long time, so I decided to make my own version of it with quite a few twists.  I’ll talk about that at a later date when I have something impressive to show you.  Let’s talk about the rules for Ataxx for now.  The game is similar to Othello or Reversi where two players play on a board each with different color pieces.  Just like Othello, the point is to create more pieces and convert as many of your opponent’s pieces as possible.  Tokens can move in one of two ways.  They can slide or jump.    To slide, you select one of your pieces, and you then select any vacant square on the board that is adjacent to the piece.  This will cause your piece to divide in two, that is, you have now 2 pieces, one in the original location, and one in the new location.  To jump, select one of your pieces, and then select a vacant square that lies one space beyond where you can slide.  For example, if you have a piece at (3, 3), it can slide to (4, 3), but it can jump to (5, 3).  Sadly, when you jump, you are moving that piece, it does not divide.  Whenever you place a piece on the board, be it by sliding or jumping, any of your opponent’s pieces that are adjacent to the one you just placed become yours.  Simple, right?  Anyway, I’m developing and testing the core functionality of the game; the rules and AI, if you will.  So that I will not get distracted by graphics, sound, resource management, etc, I decided to create a cheesy, half-assed text-mode test program.  The interface of the test program is crappy.  You have to play with the CAPS-Lock on.   Sorry :).  It was not meant to be played by anyone.  But since my fans are requesting, nay, demanding new content, who am I to refuse.  It runs under Windows.  Have fun, and any feedback is welcome.  You can get the file  urlLink right here , it's only 47kb.

       This Week in Weird #1  Welcome everyone to this new weekly column where we at Arabundi.com scour the web to uncover the most bizarre happenings of the week so that you don't have to.  But Arabundi, I hear you say, you just wen't on Reuters an Ananova and just picked some stuff out of their "weird stories" sections.  True enough, but here you will find the best of both worlds, so deal with it.  Without further ado, let's start in Budapest in that whacky country of Hungary where it seems that a TV show hostess is going to be running for a seat in the European Parliament.  You naysayers are probably thinking that she'll never win...  urlLink but what if she runs naked?   Anettka Feher, in her 30s, decided that she's going to run nude, but don't let that distract you from her poignant issues, after all it's just a means to an end.  Now, Ms. Feher isn't the only one to bear it all in the European Parliament.  Ilona Staller, another Budapest native better known as the  urlLink Cicciolina (not work safe) , the Italian porn star, has held an Italian seat in the parliament for years.  Does this mean that Anettka and the Cicciolina have something in common?  Not if you ask Anettka.  "If they (Hungarian mainstream politicians) think I am just another Cicciolina, they are in for a big surprise: I am smart, and I have a daily four-hour presence on a national television channel."  Yes, well, good thing you set us all straight.  I will never doubt your cranial capacity again. (Reuters)  Keeping with the "nude" trend, lets talk about that quiet, wintery town of Madison, Maine.  It seems Normand St. Michel has a dream.   urlLink He wants to open a coffee shop.   How could his small operation fare against the Starbucks, the Dunkin Donuts, the Krispy Kremes of the world?  Simple, in a maneuver that is part Hooters, part strip club, and part Starbucks, he's going to hire topless waitresses.  Yes, you read that right, a topless coffeeshop.  I don't know, I might actually start drinking coffee now.  The best part is that Mr. St. Michel is going to go by the book and already got the go-ahead for "Heavenly Angels" from the Chamber of Commerce.  Oddest of all, the city does not impose an age limit, though St. Michel has decided that his will be an 18+ establishment.  Doors open this summer, who's with me? (Reuters)  One more sex related story, I promise it's the last one and you won't find this on Reuters!  I've saved the best for last.  In the course of your lifetime, you may have known someone who actually bought a blow-up sex doll.  These poor individuals must degrade themselves, time after time by fornicating with what really ammounts to a floatation device with a surprised expression.  For those what want kwalitee, they can check out  urlLink Real Doll (definitely not work safe) .  You see, Real Dolls look and feel (supposedly) like a human being.  They have skeleton, skin, a rubbery, meaty feel to them.  One has described it as "humping a corpse" having lead to his first "morguegasm".  These "companions" are not cheap, starting at $5999 and going from there.  For such a price, you are allowed several choices in body types and what not, from  urlLink the strip club dancer , to  urlLink the freakish hentai anime girl .  Wowza.  Comic Book Guy will never be lonely again!  Now, you'll hardly find a Consumer Report on this form of entertainment, but fear not, a detailed account of an encounter with a Real Doll is  urlLink documented here .  Read it, it's hillarious.  Probably not work safe.  More to come later today...

      Every now and again, I’ll read something on the paper that elicits the only sane, reasonable response from me: complete and utter rage.  When this usually happens, it spreads like a virulent disease across other subject matter.  Yesterday, I read two such things.  Oh boy!  If you are gay or live in Boston, or are gay and living in Boston, you probably heard that gay marriages are legal in the Bay state.  Good for them.  Not being gay, it does not affect me.  However, the Boston Commons was swamped on Sunday by thousands of people protesting that gay marriages should be illegal.  Not to be outdone, a throng of supporters of gay marriages met them in what can only be described as a Braveheart-esque melee.  Instead of swords, they wielded signs, there really wasn’t a melee per se, and nobody really got eviscerated (sadly).  When I read this, four magical words of power sprung to mind. “Who gives a fuck?!”  Which were followed closely by “Why is this on the front page?”  Why is this important?  In a tiny, minuscule corner of the paper there was another headline stating that our esteemed president changed his story as to why we went to war with Iraq, you see, Saddam didn’t have weapons of mass destructions, but he could have built them.  HOLY FUCKING SHIT!  What kind of world do we live in where an anti-gay and an anti-anti-gay parade gains larger exposure than the president’s bullshit about a war he started for no reason other than to inflate his popularity while dragging the country’s good name in through the gutter?  I don’t give a rat’s ass if you don’t want gays to marry.  You are not important.  You are an insignificant ant who wants to be heard once in its insignificant live.  Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up already.   Wah Gays can’t marry, it’s against God.  Wah, gays can’t marry, it’s against nature.  Here’s a news flash, what makes this country great is freedom of thought, speech, and religion.  Therefore you cannot apply your religious beliefs to anyone.  You see, you are not special anymore, you don’t count.  That is why when a simian redneck from Texas says that he’s a man close to God and then dictates policy for the free world, I want to cry.  Church and State do not mix; they are like oil and water.  Don’t even try, or rabid wolverines will claw your face out (at least in my mind).    So now where do we stand?  We went to war with Iraq.  We lost an uncountable number of soldiers, more during the post-war than during the war in search of these elusive WMDs.  Now that they are nowhere to be found the president says that it wasn’t the reason we went there?  Excuse me, take that banana from out of your mouth, Cheetah, and say that one more time slowly, in English, without making up words this time?  WHAT THE FUCK?  Why were we there at all?  In the wake of this fiasco there was on the paper in big bold letter that a letter was found from someone’s close friend’s aunt’s cousin’s sister former roommate that terrorists are in Iraq.  Woop dee doo!  Holy shit, am I glad we invaded.  Say, is this information as valid as the WMD information we had?  How sure are you?  Would you be willing to war for it?  Oops, too late for that.  It’s high time we get a new president.  Bush and Dick have fucked up our country too much, it’s almost criminal.  The only possible good replacement would be Kerry.  Let’s hope he wins.    Coincidentally Kerry stated that he’s against gay marriages, but it’s should be up to the individual states to decide on the policy rather than having a nationwide blanket rule.  I like that.  He shows balls to make a decision without dodging the bullet, but then says that he’s not going to impose his preference, leaving it up to the states to sort it out.  Since we are on back on the subject of gays, don’t be fooled into thinking I’m a pro gay hippie.  I have my share of bitching for them, and it goes a little something like this:  SHUT THE FUCK UP!  I don’t go around telling everyone that I love women.  I don’t go around deepening my voice to an extent as to make me a human subwoofer just to show how manly I am.  I act like a normal person.  More over if I DID do that, I’d be a homophobic chauvinist pig.  However, I walk on my college campus and see signs that say “I have a strap-on, what are you going to do about it?”  and I have to smile and nod?  Hell no!  Shut the fuck up!  It’s 2004.  You are not shocking anyone anymore.  You won’t any more attention by screaming “I’m gay!  Are you shocked yet?”  No, I’m not shocked.  Now get that dick out your ass and we can actually converse like adults.  I see a gay couple acting like a couple, and I’m fine with that.  Guess what?  Nobody likes to see and constantly-overly-lovey couple, no matter what preferences they have.  So, no, it’s not a fucking personal attack.  Stop hiding behind that shield.  Not everyone who disagrees with you a homophobe, moron.  When I see someone that has purposely gone out of his/her way to make sure everyone knows they are gay, I just have to laugh not to cry.  Just shut the fuck up.  Honestly, nobody cares.  You are not that important.  You are not going to make the 5 o’clock news.  Now, stop giving normal gay people a bad name.  In summary: To the anti-gays I say, SHUT THE FUCK UP.  To the obnoxiously gay I say, SHUT THE FUCK UP.  To that primate in the White House I say, SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LOSE THE ELECTION ALREADY!  Ah, that feels better.

      Anyone who knows me knows about my fascination for giant robots, it borders on the pathological.&nbsp; I grew up in Italy, and all they ever aired were Japanese cartoons.&nbsp; Mazinger Z, Daitarn, Gaiking, Grandizer, and Getter Robo were my babysitters.&nbsp; One cannot forget about Daltainus, Great Mazinger, Jeeg, and of course, Trider G7.&nbsp; Add to this a healthy diet of Voltron, Danguard, and Gordian and you can finally begin to see where I get my problems. :)&nbsp; And that was only the Giant Robot Anime! (A great resource for all the robots I mentioned is  urlLink here  though in Italian)  In any case, the series that's always been close to my nerdy heart has been Mazinger Z (known as Tranzor Z here in the States, why? why?) and it's sequel, Great Mazinger (Great Trenzor?).&nbsp; I was more than happy to find out that Bandai won't let the franchise die and came out with urlLink Mazinkaizer , an even more badass version of Mazinger Z.&nbsp; Yes, I'm a whore.&nbsp; Yes, Go Nagai can shit on a canvas, call it a giant robot, and I'd buy it.&nbsp; It's not my fault.&nbsp; I'm wired that way.&nbsp; Luckily for me, urlLink ADV Films  acquired the rights to Mazinkaizer and is already selling a translated version, which is not being renamed to Trenzorkaizer (thank you God).  These days there seem to be two groups, the Realistic Robots and the Super Robots camps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Super Robots are any of the ones I have mentioned already.&nbsp; They kick ass because the robots, thought unlikely they could exist, have an almost magical quality, utilize weird science and most of all, have villains that are just over the top.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Realistic Robot camp try to peddle robots that might actually, very remotely, be feasible.&nbsp; Robotech, Gundam, Eva to some extent.&nbsp; In these, even though they may have some questionable science (Gundanium?) they mostly make sense.&nbsp; They also seem more &quot;war&quot; oriented.&nbsp; The villains are not memorable IHMO.&nbsp; I mean, where's the eccentric evildoer bent on world domination in Eva?&nbsp; Where?!  Give me Super Robots any day.&nbsp; Good thing Japan listens to me.&nbsp; Good Japan, have a cookie.  Enter  urlLink Shinkon Gattai Godannar ... literally translated to Newlyweds Combine Godannar... Granted, not the most badass title, but damn!&nbsp; I say DAMN!&nbsp; They have everything that makes a great Giant Robot anime.&nbsp; Giant Robot (it's a good start) whacky characters, evil monsters, eccentric villains, and bouncing boobs.&nbsp; Ok, the last is really a more modern change.&nbsp; Change is good.  The premise is that these creature called the Mimesis are attacking earth and Japan's once again protecting us all with the help of a team of super robots.&nbsp; The last attack was five years ago, when Saruwatari Goh defeated the evil leader of these creature, costing him the life of his teammate and partner.&nbsp; He retires from active duty in order to forget what has happened.&nbsp; Five years go by and Goh's marring a girl he saved during that battle when a call comes in:&nbsp; The Mimesis are back.&nbsp; Leaving his bride at the altar, he jumps into the cockpit of Dannar and begins the asskicking.  The best part&nbsp; is that Dannar can combine with another robot (eventually piloted by his wife) to form Godannar, the Super Giant Robot.&nbsp; I almost busted a nut when I saw them combine.&nbsp; What can I say?&nbsp; I love combining robots.  Sadly, nobody's licensed Shinkon Gattai Godannar, however, fansubs can be obtained by those with even an ounce of resourcefulness.&nbsp; If you like giant robots, I definitely recommend it.&nbsp; Watch it!&nbsp; Watch it!&nbsp;  The power of my monkey compels you !

      I’ve been too busy to post recently, what can I say?&nbsp; I’m a slacker.&nbsp; Let’s see, what’s happened since the end of February?      In March I went to the  urlLink Game Developer's Conference  with a good  urlLink  friend of mine .&nbsp; The con was amazing as usual, as California was    HOT   !&nbsp; Spending the nights in the  Jacuzzi when back east they had to deal with negative degree weather.&nbsp; All in all, a very good vacation.     Soon thereafter, we rented  urlLink a cabin in the woods of Maine  for my friend's bachelor party.&nbsp; The place could not be any more out of a  urlLink Stephen King  novel if it tried.&nbsp; If you've seen  urlLink Dreamcatcher , then you know what I mean when I say we were expecting ass aliens to attack us at any moment.&nbsp; Never mind the 5 hour drive to get there, there was an extra two hour drive to get to the closest signs of civilization!&nbsp; All in  all, it was tremendous fun, and not easily forgotten.     The very next week I went to NYC with a bunch of friends for yet another bachelor party and DAMN...&nbsp; to quote  urlLink Zach Stroum , I got more ass than a toilet seat :) That is all I have to say about that.     Why the very next week both bachelors got married... on the same day!&nbsp; Well, I had to pick one and stick it to the other.&nbsp;  urlLink  What is these people's fascination with doing stuff so far away? &nbsp; Two hours I drive to the wedding, I'm part of the wedding, I then drive two hours back, only to realize that my girlfriend's keys were still in the hotel...&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Driving back and back again, we finally get home.&nbsp; But... I can't stay mad at her, she's just too cute.     You'd think that now I'd finally be able to rest... Oh ho!&nbsp; You'd be mistaken!&nbsp; My workplace became like a bad scene from  urlLink Office Space , and I was locked away typing up  urlLink TPS reports  for our mid-May deadline... After making it, like the vile demonic mimes that they are, Upper Management(tm) says that we have yet more  urlLink TPS reports  to write.&nbsp; Might I mention that I'm a Software Engineer and these reports are causing my neurons to fire in on themselves, committing suicide.&nbsp; *sigh*     With all this insanity, I lost my mind and dyed my hair blue.&nbsp; I must say that I like people's reaction when they see it.    So now, I'm hurrying away for our second deadline, hoping against hope that my urge to kill management and marketing can be suppressed yet another day.&nbsp; I hear that there's no internet connection in jail, I could not live like that.

      Yesterday I've posted a message on  urlLink John Romero's site  about my  urlLink Hyperspace Deliver Boy Resource Viewer , the very same viewer that will soon be an editor.  Lo' and behold, not only did he reply,  urlLink he said that is was pretty cool!   Needless to say that made my day!  It has certainly given me an extra oomph to push this software to its limits.  This is very good, very good indeed :)  Anyway, here's the 411 on HDBEdit.  Yes, the name is silly, yet more descriptive than me calling it Apocalyptic Transient.  The program is in the alpha stage, which means that it's far from being completed, whole sections don't work/exist but at least it works enough to showcase it bit.  Normally you don't see alpha software floating around, but hey, I'm an attention whore.  Basically, this program opens the PC version Hyperspace Delivery Boy files (*.MPC) and lets you view the resource therein (graphics, scripts, sounds).  It does not yet show maps, but all in good time, all in good time.  The overall goal is to create an original HDB fan mission.  "Guy Carrington: In search of the Them?" who knows?  Lot's of ideas, but this software needs to be written first.  I'm finishing my MPC module so that it can convert data both ways.  I'm probably going to replace the List View with a Tree View to make searching and editing files easier.  Yes, I have lots of things on the horizon.  Lets see how far I can take this.

      I've finally a very rough version of my resource file viewer.  There's lots of stuff still missing (like the ability to export, import, and edit files) and, well, it's ugly.  But, damn, it works and I'm happy :)  I'll post a more detailed rant when I get home tonight.  In the meantime, you can get it  urlLink here .  PS: I only tested it on Windows XP, your mileage may vary.

      I'm a very good fan of Lewis Black, a very angry, cynical, jaded comedian.  In one of his bits, he tells the audience why people get aneurisms even though doctors can't figure it out.  Paraphrasing the skit, he's at IHOP and hears a woman saying that if it weren't for her horse, she would not have spent that year in college.  Your brain will try, unsuccessfully, to figure that out (was she riding the horse to school?  Did she have a polo pony scholarship?) until it realizes that someone who went to college would never have said something so stupid to begin with; when you have that thought  *boom*  you're dead.  Today, I write to you from my deathbed as I've had a similar moment.  A moment that I will share with you all because if I can't live to take over the world, I'm sure as hell bringing a bunch of you bastards with me.  Go over  urlLink here  and read this very very small article.  Go on.  I'll wait for you.  Go!  Good, now read it again.  I'm not kidding.   urlLink Read it again .  Do it dammit!  Stop questioning every single freaking request I make.  Just do it.  Good.  Now...  What the FUCK!    I mean What The Fuck.  Capital double you, capital why, capital eff!  I can just picture the drug dealers now "shit man, I may deal dope, but I'm a taxpaying citizen." or "Man, I'm not gonna compound my sins by evading taxes too, foo."  Holy Fuck, is it possible that all the dammed inbreeding has finally taken its toll?  Here's a free tip: Lead paint chips are not the same as Frito Lays chips.  Trust me on this one.  Not that you're reading this as it's devoid of pictures.  I mean, let's break this down:  "Drugs seized without stamps or having expired stamps may result in criminal or civil penalties which may include fines, seizure of property or liens against real estate."  And what about drugs WITH stamps?  Or are you saying that if you get thrown in jail for drug possession, on top of the incarceration, fines, seizure of property or liens agaist real estate, they'll give you additional fines, seizures of property or liens against real estate? "Yessiree Cletus, we's gonna get 'em on double whammy!"  Wait, it gets better.   A dealer is not required to give his/her name or address when purchasing stamps and the Department is prohibited from sharing any information relating to the purchase of drug tax stamps with law enforcement or anyone else."  Never mind Sergeant Cletus waiting for you outside of the office.  It's good to know that even drug dealers have rights.    Just keep this in mind as we move on to the FAQ:    What methods of payment are accepted for purchasing drug tax stamps?  Only cash, money order, or a cashier's check can be used to purchase drug tax stamps. No personal checks are allowed.  What?  No checks?  But you know Im good for it!  How about this stolen credit card?  Will you accept payments in hashish?    How much do drug tax stamps cost?  Drug tax stamps can be purchased in denominations and multiples of $10, $50, $100, $500, and $1000.    What is the minimum purchase required for purchasing drug tax stamps?  $100.  "Sorry we only cater to serious offenders here"  And the clincher, this is where they throw their net, ensnare the lazy drug dealer, this is where the mastermind of their plan comes together like a right-wing bar-b-que at a bubaki convention.    Can I purchase drug tax stamps through the mail?  Yes. The purchaser will need to   provide their mailing address   in order for the Department to send the drug tax stamps.   GOTCHA!  I wonder if "Drop them off by the bridge at midnight" is a valid address.

      Like every other "capitalist peeg", I want to make a ridiculous amount of money.  So much money to be able to rival Uncle's Scrooge's money bin, but where he filled it with coins, I'd fill it with Benjamins.  On my drive to work I asked myself how I could do this and how low I'd be willing to go to do it.  Sure I can kidnap people and sell them into white slavery, but that gets old fast.  I need something that will make me rich overnight... and then the idea hit me.  I should start a boy band!  I'll call it N*Sane and it will be a cross between N*Sync and Disturbed.  I even have the title of my first song "Stupid Bitch, I Fucking Love U!"  I think I have a hit on my hands.  Anyway, I guess the next step is to find several other guys to fit the template.  Let's see, I'll be the twitchy cynic so that leaves, angsty goth, the gentle jock, the bitter prettyboy, and of course, the androgynous shlep who will eventually betray us and leave us for his own contract deal.  After that, it's simple.  Just parade out in our wife-beaters (that's a kind of shirt, shithead) and ovesized jeans.  MTV is gonna pick us up faster than R. Kelly at a playground.  We'll be rich with a religious following comprised mostly of socially inept, possibly overweight, teenage girls who will assassinate the world leaders on our command!  MUAHAHAHA!  What better way to become rich than by ruling the world.  I just noticed that all my schemes end with me ruling the world.  Odd.

      Ah, I squeal in delight as interesting things come my way.    I've spent a few hours every day over the weekend reverse engineering the file format for  urlLink John Romero 's and  urlLink Tom Hall 's  urlLink Hyperspace Delivery Boy .  Yes, the same John Romero that brought us Commander Keen, Doom, Quake, and Daikatana.  The game is a sleeper hit, it's funny, addictive, and good ol' fashion 2D.  Anyway, I've decided to reverse engineer the file format so that I could ultimately write a game editor for it.  HDB is not really meant to have "fan made missions" but hey, we do lots of things that we aren't meant to do and so far I've encountered no hurdle too difficult to pass.  But why, why am I doing this?  It's part intellectual excercise (I have unused cycles in my brain), part fandom, part wanting to write a game editor, and partly  just because.  I don't expect this to gain me anything other than... NOTORIETY, FAME, and FORTUNE!!! ... or not.  If I can make a fan mission or mod for HDB, I'll be happy.  If anyone else makes one too, then I'll be dementedly happy. :)  Right now, I have a program that extracts and converts to a usable format most of the game's resounces.  All the sound effect, dialog, scripts, music, and most of the graphics.  Once I finish that, I'll tackle reverse engineering the map format (the most difficult bit) and from there I'll write a resource viewer.  From the viewer, I'll spawn the editor.  When I have more to show I'll post it here.  In the meantime, go play  urlLink Hyperspace Delivery Boy!

      Just like everybody else, I too am not immune to the occasional (ie, constant, incessant) spam.  Amidst all the enlargement ads, I found a choice gem: a PayPal scam email.  You may ask "Why am I even bothering to mention it?"  Certainly it's not unique, many have tried and few have even succeeded.  What astounds me is that if these people are trying, some people are taking the bait.  This concerns me deeply because if someone falls for the message I'm about to show you, it surely means the end of mankind is nigh.  Here's the message, annotated, with emphasis on the best parts:   From :  service@paypal.com   Reply-To :  service@ paypaI .com  [ED: PayPaI? Isn't that chinese food?]  Sent :  Saturday, June 5, 2004 11:25 AM  Subject :  PayPal Service Fraud Warning !    Dear PayPal valued member,  Due to concerns, for the safety and integrity of the PayPal community we have issued this warning message.   [ED: note the clever grammar and dramatic use of the coma]    It has come to our attention that your account information needs to be  renew    [ED: who needs verb conjugation, certainly not PayPal!]   due to inactive members, spoof reports and frauds.   You must to renew    [ED: Do I even have to comment here?]   your records and you will not run into any future problems with the online service.  However, failure to update your records will result in account  deletation.    [ED: Perhaps  urlLink Homestar Runner  works for PayPal... BALEETED!]    This notification expires on June 07, 2004.   [ED: Better hurry, they need money to buy Harry Potter tickets]    Once you have updated your account records  your PayPal    [ED: What? My own, personal PayPal?]   will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.   Please follow the link below and renew your account information.    [ED: of course, the link supplied does not go anywhere near PayPal]   I mean, c'mon!  If you are gonna try to steal my money, at least put a small semblance of effort into it!

      Hello again, readers.   I know that it's been a while and that my last few updates have been lacking in the angst department, but unlike most angry-angst musical bands that still pretend to be ansgty and angry well after they are cleaning their asses with Benjamins, you'll find no such hypocrisy here. No sir.   As a matter of fact, I've had the  urlLink "Movin' On Up!" song  from the hit '70s TV show, "The Jeffersons" stuck in my head for a while now (recently replaced with  urlLink Manamana  by the Muppets). Except, I'm not moving to the east side, as the song would suggest, rather, I'm moving to the west side.   My good friend  urlLink Kim  called it my Cinderella story in that Prince Charming swooped down to my place after we danced like wild animals the night before and made me try a size 11 glass pump. It fit like a dream. So we've eloped and lived happily ever after... Actually, if you replace Prince Charming with Microsoft, Dancing all night with Interviewing all Day, and Trying on the Glass Slipper with  urlLink  Giving Me a Job With the XBox Live Team  , then you're beginning to get the picture.   Yes my dear readers! I'm moving back to Washington State and am now officially part of the gaming industry! Woo! Woo! I've met my future coworkers (who the hell orks cows? For that matter, what is orking?) and they seem like a fun bunch. This is gonna be great.   Why, why am I moving 3000 miles away? Well, aside from the fact that I'll be working for a rock-solid company that treats their employees like their most valuable asset, working with really cool people, and doing what I always wanted... well, let's just say they made me an offer I couldn't refuse.   I start my new job at the end of August and will leave shortly before. So if I know you, we must hang out  rabidly  before I leave.   Oh yes, "We finally got a piece of the pie."
