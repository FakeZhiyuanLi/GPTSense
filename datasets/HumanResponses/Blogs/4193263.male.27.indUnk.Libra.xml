      I started a new part time job today. My pseudo title is Sunday Afternoon Program Director (sounds cool huh). The job itself is about as enjoyable as trying to catch a fly with a toothpick. All I do is set in a both and play gospel music for six hours. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with gospel music if you like gospel music. Me I can take it or leave it. But anyway, I took the job for the same reasons anyone takes a job I needed the extra money. So I'm working at a job that I really don't like playing music that I don't like and what is the only thing that keeps popping into my mind? "I would really love a roast beef sandwich." Don't ask me why this is but for some reason for the next four hours all I could think of was how much I wanted a damn roast beef sandwich. So my shift finale ends and I walk in the door only to find that for dinner my mom has made, you guessed it, roast beef. After a slight brain fart I make myself a nice sandwich with the full knowledge that all was right with the universe. However, tomorrow I think I'll ask for a sack full of money so I quit my sad excuse of a job.  BTW: This doesn't have anything to do with the topic but there is a new version of Mountain Dew called Pitch Black. It taste somewhat like Welches Grape Juice with a mild caffeine kick. I suggest you give it a try.

      In the news today I read where the California Supreme Court ruled that the same sex marriages performed in San Francisco were invalid due to the fact that the state's constitution defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Now I understand that the court had no choice but to rule the way it did. After all it is not the role of the court to create law but rather to judge the laws that already exist. The issue of same sex marriages is not going to go away simply because of the decision of one state's Supreme Court. It wouldn't matter if forty-nine states declared same sex marriages to be illegal. The full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution declares that if one state declares that same sex marriages are legal than all states must acknowledge those marriages as legal. They will not have to allow the marriages to be performed within their boarders but they must extended the same legal protections enjoyed by traditional marriages to same sex marriages. I like to think of myself as being a rather open minded person. In truth I could give a rats ass about the legality of same sex marriages. However, I must make my point clear. In my opinion if a same sex couple wants to get married I say let them. After all they should have the right to be as miserable as the rest of us. Marriage is not some great sacred institution to be worshipped. It's simply a oath between two people who agree to share the ups and downs of their lives while relying on one another for support. In this day and age people get married more for the benefits that marriage brings rather than for any other reason. Yet I could be wrong about all this I'm not perfect I know this. This is just my opinion and if anyone disagrees with me that's their right.

       Well as the title say here we go. This is my very first blog so pardon my newness. Anyway a little about myself. I'm a typical American male (if any such thing truly exist) living in the often joked about state of Alabama. Most people me somewhat of an enigma. That is to say that my personality is not exactly what one would expect it to be. Anyway, I love anime, Star Trek, and various other television programs. My hobbies include creating computer wallpaper for which I maintain a website at  urlLink http://ctlpro.topcities.com    (please visit) :) Other than that I'm normal or rather I can fake being normal enough to fool most people.    I think that I end this introduction now, but I will continue to write about whatever as time goes on.
