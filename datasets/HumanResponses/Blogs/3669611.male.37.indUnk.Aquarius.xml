      Today I followed a car into work, and it had a rainbow sticker on it. I assume you know the ones I mean, they're pretty common, and denote (at least in my ignorant mind) that the driver (or at least owner) of the car is gay or lesbian.  That part doesn't confuse me, but I do wonder why do they put them on their car?  I kind of look at these stickers in the same light I look at alumni license plate holders (actually alumni license plate holders are another beast unto themselves, I actually don't get them at all). They exist to signify to the rest of the world some sort of affiliation.   But why?  I guess I view my friends and coworkers who are gay (or lesbian, but I'm not going to type out 'or lesbian' anymore) as just being folks I work with. Who they choose to love or share their lives with is inconsequential to me, it doesn't affect how I interact with them.   I do have some the theories on the stickers though. The most obvious thought is that these stickers are a symbol to raise public awareness. To let the average citizen know that their are gays all around them. This, of course, presupposes that the average person knows what the sticker means to begin with.   Another thought I had is that it allows members of a like community to readily identify each other. This could be helpful if you need to cut into heavy traffic on the 520 I suppose. The rainbow sticker could be your free pass. I also suppose it could cause someone to try and run you off the road.   I guess deep down I wish it wasn't necessary for folks to have rainbow stickers. I mean, at the end of the day it shouldn't matter should it? People are what they are, and it's not my place to judge them if they're not infriging upon my health, safety, and happiness.   My goodness, I'm so in touch with my feelings today.

      Although I call myself an Ignorant White Guy, I think that maybe I'm not. I mean, I know I'm ignorant, there is no debate on that topic. However, whether or not I'm white could be debated.   It is distinctly possible that I'm an Ignorant Hispanic Guy. As it turns out, my mother is Spanish, and I was actually born in Spain (near Barcelona for anyone who cares). My father is 100% American (born in Wisconsin, not sure you can get any more American than that).   So, since I'm half Spanish, am I a Hispanic-American or Latino?  I always said I was for things like job applications and financial aid, but always wondered if I really qualified for that "bucket".   Part of me believes that you're Hispanic-American or Latino if you come from one of the South or Central American countries, and to be REALLY Hispanic-American you need to come from Mexico.   I don't think I'm a minority, and I don't think I'm Latino - even if my name is Miguel Garcia

      Some folks (the 2 or 3 who actually ever find this Blog) will think that I'm being flippant or smarmy with the questions I ask here. Nothing could be further from the truth.   I am an ignorant white guy, I have no idea what it means to be Jewish (or should I say a Jew?) or African-American (or should I say black). I am not gay (or should I say homosexual). I've never been persecuted, or discrimaated against (at least not that I was aware of - again - I'm ignorant).   I honestly want to know what people think with regards to the questions I ask. And, I never intend to offend anyone with those questions (ok - maybe I do, but only in distinct cases, and it will be clear who I'm trying to offend).   This site has nothing to do with being politically correct; being politically correct is the last thing I worry about on a day to day basis. Ok, so maybe not the last thing – but it’s down there with whether or not Whitney Houston can ever resurrect her career.  So before someone posts a comment or sends me an email saying that I'm a racist or a cynic or whatever else, I'm not - I'm none of those things.   I'm simply an ignorant white guy
