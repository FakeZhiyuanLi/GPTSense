						   - Arrival at the airport. All 14 of us were greeted with garlands by the tourist agents (ala Hawaii).  - Ride in the tourist bus. Our first glimpse of Bali. The Kuta Town was quite dusty due to roadworks being carried out before the elections. Hhmm.. I sensed a political strategy somewhere here. - Kuta Paradiso Hotel. The hotel we stayed in. Once you reach the lobby, you can see 5 stars above the sign: KUTA PARADISO HOTEL BALI. All these in gold, by the way. And below the sign, there's a water fountain with 5 eerily-looking status sitting in a circle looking as if chanting over the water that splashes in front of them. They look like bomohs to me. Imagine passing them by at night at the lobby where there's no one around. *shudder* Anyway, we checked into our rooms, refreshed ourselves for 1/2 hour and hopped on the bus for our first sight-seeing. - Tanah Lot. The Hindu temple built by the sea. The place looked serene. We arrived there just in time to catch the sunset and took pictures of the temple. A few of us also visited the cave underneath the temple where, for a small donation, you can drink the 'holy' water and being blessed by the Hindu priest.  - Jimbaran. Our first dinner place in Bali. Jimbaran is a long stretch of beach known for its huge waves and dining on the beach. So a lot of restaurants have set up tables on the beach with candles and dim lights. Very romantic if you were on a honeymoon. But the food there sucks though. We had dinner at Ganesa Cafe that served typical Balinese food and seafood as their specialty. Whatever you do, DO NOT take a peek at their kitchen. You'll lose your appetite in an instant.  - Hard Rock Cafe. I went there alone to check the place since everyone else was too full or too tired or both. Surprisingly, there were a lot of people from Jakarta, rather than caucasians. Nevertheless, the girls looked like either Kris Dayanti or a famous actress. There was a band that played all the current hits and they were not too bad. One of them looked like Anggun and the other looked a lot like my friend, Zanita. They really knew how to work the crowd.   Stay tuned for Day 2....

						   Managed to wake up at 6am from only 2 hours of sleep. Guess the excitement (and also last-minute packing) only could get me to bed by 4am. Anyway, I arrived at KL Sentral at about 7.10am and good thing I was actually one of the early ones there. Met up with a few colleagues of mine (this was my deparment trip, by the way) and we checked in our luggage, bought our ERL tickets, and boarded the ERL to KLIA. Didn't realise that KLIA would be bustling with people at that hour, but it was human traffic jam central. We met up with the rest of our colleagues at McDonald's for a quick breakfast.   Just to update everyone: I've been working in Citibank for about 7 months now. I work in the Total Quality Department on Level 12, Menara Citibank on Jalan Ampang, KL. My department consists of only 14 people, so in a way, it's good that we are travelling in a small group. Okay, back to the story...  While we were having brekkie at McD's, I noticed this tall, lanky gorgeous girl was walking towards our table. And she was smiling at me! Surprise, surprise... it was only my colleague's friend who had planned to join our trip to Bali. And man, was she gorgeous! Here's the lowdown of her: 27 year old malay girl of mix Japanese, Indian and Malay parentage, 5'8", and a part-time model. She's been a model for Fair & Lovely ad, and recently, Time. By the way, the reason why she was smiling at me (or I thought she was) was because her friend was sitting beside me at that time. Sigh... no matter. But her smile did make me melt a little.  Okay, this is what I wrote in the airplane about 29,000 feet above sea level at about 10.17am, squeezed between a huge-ass Dutch guy and the window. Shall never request for a window seat again! Anyway, here goes:   On the way to Bali now. Been waiting for this trip for a long time. I guess that's how you feel after coming back from 3 years of studying overseas. You just miss flying off somewhere. Anywhere. Just took a friendship test on today's NST (courtesy of Malaysian Airlines). The test was all about what type of a friend you are from the scenarios given and what you would do for a friend. I scored 37/40! And I'm classified as 'The Perfect Friend', but I have my doubts on that. Am I really the "perfect" friend? Sometimes I feel that I'm "perfect" because I'm so easily influenced (and sometimes being used) by my friends. No doubt that I have great love and respect for my friends but sometimes I have my reservations. My friends are a great bunch, from (almost) all walks of life, always fun to be with, etc. But I realised that one can never hang out with friends for too long and also never to expect anything from them. If they do something you don't expect, consider it as a bonus. If they don't do what you expect, you'll just end up being disappointed in them and the friendship starts to deteriorate.  While we were having brekkie at McD's just now, Alvin asked me about Akademi Fantasia. I told him (like I told everyone else) that I'm still waiting for the answer from Astro, whether I've made it to be one of the 50 finalists in the country or not. But basically, I'm tired of hoping for anything. If I get it, I'll get it. If I don't, then it's not meant to be. Life goes on. The thing is, it's difficult to let go and not hope since everyone else you know will ask about Akademi Fantasia every single day. So you're constantly reminded of the agony of waiting. But that's what I have to do for now. Just wait...   See Pat, I did write something for the blog. Hehehe....

						   At last! Managed to work up the courage to do this. Have always been skeptical of writing in a diary for fear of people reading my inner thoughts, but I have to get used to this. So here goes.... Zamil's Life 101!

						   Event: Andrea Bocelli's Concert Venue: Singapore Indoor Stadium Time: 8pm  What can I say? Listening AND watching him sing just lifted everyone's spirits. He made quite a few people cry when he sang his rendition of "Ave Maria". And he definitely had me in tears when he sang "The Prayer" during an encore. What do you expect? That was the first song I heard from him. The most wonderful duet of all time. The very first song which made sing in Italian. The song that made me win awards in Australia.   What else can I say?...

						   This just in....  Just received a call from the organiser. I'm going to be in the first group of 10! We will have to check-in at Berjaya Times Square Hotel at 9.45am on Sunday, 11th July 2004.  From then on, the first group of 11 will undergo vocal training, makeover sessions, photo-shoots and interviews. The performance will be shown live on 8TV at 9.45pm on Friday, 16th July 2004. The results will be announced on Sunday evening, 18th July 2004. The 3 contestants with the highest number of votes will determine if we are in the Final 11!  Wish me luck guys!

						   Highlights Of The Day:  Meeting with the head honcho of 8TV, Mr Ahmad Izham Omar. His comments were: "I have seen each and everyone of you perform during the audition and the elimination rounds. We have left it to the judges to pick the best 30 contestants in Malaysia. I think the judges have made their right choice in selecting all of you because each of you are special in your own way. One of you will be the first Malaysian Idol and represent Malaysia in the World Idol competition." How's that for boosting your self-esteem? Hehehe....   The Surprise:  For being in the Top 30, this is what we all got:  - A RM1,000 pre-loaded credit card to spend, courtesy of RHB Evo Mastercard. We were advised to utilise this credit card for purposes of improving our image, ie clothes, makeup, skincare, etc.  - Clothes to be worn during the show are sponsored by Tangs, Island Shop &amp; FCUK. The clothes however need to be returned after the show. Apparently we would get to keep it if we're in the Top 10.  - Hair, makeup and make-overs are sponsored and each contestant will be attended to. I think there will be stylists and image consultants involved in this. Should be interesting....

						   The Task:  To choose 1 out of 3 songs provided and perform solo on stage. The guys had choice between Kau Ilhamku by Man Bai, Fantasy or Khalayan (English or Malay version), and Can't Take My Eyes Off You (that Carlsberg song). The girls had a choice between Kaulah Segalanya or You're My Everything by Ruth Sahanaya, and Say A Little Prayer For You by Dionne Warwick.   The Performance:  I was number 26 on the list. What a nervous wreck I was. The camera crew interviewed me a couple of times before it was my turn. I wore my brown suit with a pin-stripe shirt today, hoping to impress the judges with my rendition of Kau Ilhamku ala Josh Groban style. It looked like I was the only wearing the suit. Hopefully that would make me stand out.  My number was called out. I was escorted backstage. I could hear the girl before me performing Kaulah Segalanya. No comments from the judges after she was done. Was that a good thing? Then came my turn. I gave my very best. Trying to sound soulful and hide from the judges that I was shaking inside. Finished my verse and chorus before Paul Moss put his hand up. This is what he said: "Okay, it's obvious that you sound good. But you come in here and look like a patriotic singer, what is the image you are trying to project?...(Silence)...How do you think, when you're in Idol, the public will perceive of you??...(Silence. He sounded really annoyed!)...Something to think about." Then came Roslan Aziz's comments: "You sounded much better than yesterday." Phew!!  I walked out of the stage where, again, I was being interviewed by the camera crew. Standard questions were asked: "How do you feel after you've performed?" and "Do you think you stand a chance to be in the Top 30?" I told them that I gave my best shot and now it's up to the judges to decide, all this while hearing Shima (the famous contestant from Penang) singing Kaulah Segalanya in her own R&amp;B style. Did she forget the lyrics or was she ad-libbing on purpose? Either way, she sounded good.   The Elimination:  The wait was not that long as compared to previous days. This time around, we were called up in groups of 5.

						   The Task:  Battle of the sexes this time. Guys have to sing a song called "Vida" by Son by Four (English version) or Phyne Ballerz (Malay version) in groups of 3. Girls on the other hand, have to sing "Sinaran" by Sheila Majid (in English or Malay) in groups of 3 as well. Each contestant has to sing a verse and the chorus of the song, regardless of whether the chorus is sung in harmony or not, depending on everyone's creativity.  We were all given 3 hours (inclusive of rehearsal with the piano man and lunch) to break into groups of 3, memorise the song, and remember our "creative steps" when we perform as a group. The half-hour rehearsal with the piano man was the only time any of us got to listen to the song with music and with the correct key. After that, it was left to us to remember the tune. So, you could imagine the pressure of trying to remember a relatively new song for people such as myself. I really didn't know the song well. I have heard of the tune and all, but not the lyrics. That was the most difficult part of the practise. My 2 other groupmates had no problem remembering it because they know the song by heart!   The Performance:   The Elimination:

						   The Task:  To perform in groups of 7, alphabetically. Which meant, I was in the first group of 7! Arrghh... Damn it! To have a first name like Ahmad would always make you be one of the first to do something. Anyway, what we had to do was simple enough. Sing a verse and chorus of a song of your own choice in front of the judges, and they will determine if you will qualify to be in the top 75. Simple enough right?   The Performance:  Our names were called up for the first group of 7. I was the 6th person in line.   The Elimination:

						   4pm @ Berjaya Hotel Lobby - All the contestants were there waiting to be allocated to their rooms. Apparently, due to the Singaporean school holidays, there were not enough rooms for all contestants. Priority was given to Out-of-KL contestants. So the KL-lites had to stay in Melia Hotel across the road from Berjaya. My roommate was supposedly this Syed Abdullah guy but he hasn't arrived. We were then escorted to Melia Hotel.   5.30pm @ Berjaya Hotel Lobby - Attended a short briefing by the organisers telling us to go off for dinner and be back by 8pm. Since I got time to kill, I went home to get my jacket knowing that the briefing might take a while and I didn't want to catch a cold.   8pm @ Berjaya Hotel Manhattan Room 3 - Attended briefing by the organisers and producers of the show.   9pm - Queued-up to have our pictures taken by digital and still camera as well as introduce ourselves while being recorded by the camera crew. By the time we got back to our rooms, it was close to midnight. More surprises to come, we were told....

						   The Instruction:  - Sing the same song as the pre-audition.  - Wear the same clothes as the pre-audition.  - Be at Berjaya Times Square at 12.30pm.   The Wait:  I arrived at Berjaya Times Square at 12pm. Met up with Joa, Julian & Pat and accompanied them for lunch. Was too nervous to eat anyway so I just had tea. Went to the audition hall at 12.30pm and was told to come back at 1.30pm cos the judges was on a lunch break. Fine. Had another round of tea with Joa, Julian &amp; Pat at Starbucks this time. Went back up at 1.30pm to register. And so we waited... waited... and waited. I felt guilty for making them wait with me but they insisted to stay on and give me moral support. So sweet of them. In the end, Joa &amp; Julian had to leave cos Julian had to go back to Singapore. And then Pat had to leave cos he had to attend a wedding. Thanx guys. By the time my number was called, it was already 7pm.   The Audition:  I entered the room. It was brightly lit with the camera crew standing at the sides of the judges. I said "Hi" to the judges. Roslan said "Hi" and asked my name. I said, "Zamil" and he asked what song I was going to sing. I said, "The Prayer by Andrea Bocelli." Off you go...  I sang the chorus right up till the end. The judges were silent and didn't stop my song, even though we only have a minute and a half but I knew I had sung more than that. A few seconds of silence. Roslan started with "Wow. Where did you learn to sing like that?" and I answered: "In Australia." Paul Moss said that I had a powerful voice that filled up the whole room. He indicated that there was a slight pitching problem in one part of the song, but everything else was good. Fauziah Latiff (Jee) also pointed out the same thing. Roslan was silent the whole time. Paul said,"Ok, you're in." Jee said yes. And then Roslan said yes too. Woo hoo!

						   That Morning:  I woke up feeling really nervous that morning. And I immediately realised that I forgot to photocopy my IC at the office the day before. Arrghh... what a way to start the day! Ok, don't panic. Got myself ready and dashed to the office, knowing fully well that other shops won't open at 8.30am. Good thing it was 'Casual Friday' at my office so I totally blend in with the rest with my tucked-out pin-stripe black shirt and blue jeans. Did a few photocopies before being interrogated by my department secretary asking what the hell was I doing at the office and not at the audition. Yeah, yeah. My bad...   The Wait:  Managed to arrive at Berjaya Times Square at 9am sharp at scheduled. Was about to enter the main entrance to go the 6th floor but apparently a few others with were also directed to the lift beside the entrance, which already had a queue. The security guard told us that there was another lift at the end of the entrance and I immediately dashed towards it, which was being held open by an office-clad guy. Another girl came in with me and we breathed a heavy sigh. Maybe it was a sense of relief that the both of us didn't have to wait for that other lift. Hehehe...  When we arrived at the 6th floor, the whole floor was already full of people. Somehow, Sheri (the girl I was with) and I just went to the nearest line which had a sign saying "Pre-Registered Line 1). By that time, the crowd that was milling around was being divided into 3 lines (2 lines for registered and 1 line for walk-ins), and was asked to join behind me. Phew!! If we were to mill around like the rest, we probably had another good hour or two of waiting cos the line was LONG. Like, really LONG. Within a few minutes of queuing up, I realised that the line was until the other end of the building. Oh, by the way, I was already standing near the OTHER end of the building. So you can imagine the how long the queue was.  Made small talk with Sheri (I hope I spelled her name right) and got to know another girl called Karen. We were talking about our songs, how nervous we were and how we couldn't wait to get this over and done with. The 3 guys in front of us joined in. Albeit the nervousness shown across our faces, we managed to joke around just to ease the tension. We all had our ICs (real or photocopied) collected. Apparently they had a photocopier machine there. How convenient! Sigh... Anyway, they returned with envelopes with our names and reference ID number written on them. We were called up individually to retrieve them at the front of the line and go back to the queue. Containing inside the envelope were our photocopied IC and our contracts which had to be signed. Sigh.. Anyway, I would like to thank Pat for taking the trouble to print the contracts for me the other day.  An hour passed and our line was moving at a snail's pace. The other pre-registered and walk-in lines were moving faster than ours and we began to wonder why. But being Malaysians, we just grumbled. Eventually our line moved and we were directed to the huge hall in batches to register and hand in our signed contracts. We were given an A4 size sticker bearing our reference ID number. Mine was 15804, by the way!  Then we just had to wait in the hall where we were supposed to either warm-up, relax, surf the net, drink the coke and mineral water provided, or if you have to guts, perform in front of us.   The Audition:  Our numbers were called and we were put in groups of ten. Sheri and Karen had already went with their own groups and were escorted out. My group of ten was then escorted to another section of the hall where we were being briefed by the organisers. Basically, we were told to stick with the group even after we have gone into 'the room' and performed. We were then escorted out of the hall, passed the crowd who were still queuing up outside.  We went on the escalator to the another floor and waited outside the rooms. Apparently there were 3 'studios' (empty shoplots with partitions and carpet, more like) and we sat outside. Each of us went in....

						   Watched 'Annie' at The Arena of Stars with my parents. Since I'm the only bachelor in the family who can drive, I had no choice but to drive them to Genting. The musical was quite entertaining. It's really nice to watch some very young Malaysian actresses (one is 7 years old, I heard) to act on stage and perform in front a huge crowd. Who knows? One of them might end up being the first Malaysian to win an Oscar.

						   Here's what happened. It was a 2-hour episode. Not a single shot of me singing. Here's a list of my appearances sans singing: 1) Me and the rest of the guys (head bowed) while getting scolded by Roslan Aziz, Fauziah Latif and Paul Moss for not remembering our lyrics and basically screwing up the song. 2) Me saying "Good morning!" to the camera crew when they came to my room at 3.30am. 3) My interview in the room, talking about putting the song on repeat so that it would "sub-consciously enter our heads while we are asleep". The "we" referred to my roommate who was already asleep at that time. 4) Me alighting the bus with coffee in hand on the last day of the Theatre Eliminations. 5) Me slouching on the floor with the rest of my friends looking very glum. 6) Me saying "I don't know if I will make it" before going in the auditorium to hear the final verdict. 7) Me and the other 4 contestants on the stage, hearing the&nbsp;verdict from Paul Moss. 8) Me and the other 29 contestants on the stage, with hosts Jien and Aleya talking about what's coming up next week. 9) Me smiling stupidly&nbsp;to the camera in the foyer before everyone goes home. 10) Me singing last at the end of the credits. No sound, just the Malaysian Idol jingle.  Sigh.....

						   Finally! Got my mandatory leave approved by my boss today. He really took a bloody long time to decide. Sigh...anyway, just have to make do with my mandate then. Which means, I'll be away from the office for 10 working days, starting Friday, 9th July till Thursday, 22nd July. So now, I only have about 2 days to prepare before checking-in on the 11th. Here's what I have to do: - Have to get my bags packed with a week's worth of clothes.  - Have to buy the necessary stuff for the week or so that I'm there for.  - Have to also look out for clothes to wear during the performance, just in case the clothes they are sponsoring do not fit or suit with my image (I sound vain now. Ahaks!). - Have to get my voice in shape by drinking lots of green tea and lots of hot tea with lemon and honey, and avoiding eating anything spicy or oily or anything with dairy.  - Have to go to the gym and build up my stamina so that I can project my voice better.  - Have to recover from my flu quickly by complying with the prescription.  Hmmm. It doesn't look too much to do in 2 days, does it? Can't wait for tomorrow tho. They'll be showing a 2-hour Malaysian Idol program called 'Theatre Eliminations' on 8TV. They will show how the 113 of us got scaled down to 75 to 50 to 30 in 4 days. In the last episode (the KL audition), they only showed me jumping up and down like a bloody idiot. I wonder what they're gonna show next.    Oh yeah, first things first. Sleep...........

						   First off, went to Ikea with Mum and bought some stuff for my new room. We were trying to figure out a way of transforming my new room (formerly my married brother's) to look like a bachelor pad as opposed to the formerly bridal-looking one, with minimal costs and without any renovation of course. In the end, there was nothing much we can do except change the curtains to blinds. So much for new ideas.  In the evening, Lila and I went to Citron Cafe, where I sang 2 songs for Ramon's mother's 70th birthday. It was my first time there. The place looked nice being an old bungalow and all, the food was good, the music was playing, and the people were dancing. It could not have been better.  After that, Lila and I headed to Alexis to meet up with Ari and Sally. We were later joined with Dira and Firdaus. It was a fun evening. Our topics ranged from Malaysian Idol (strategies and imagining the absurd!) to how 80's TV shows and their music were so much fun (and stupid) compared to today's. Examples of how the past had shaped us: Macgyver - one of the coolest dudes back then. Everyone wanted to have the Richard Dean Anderson look with short hair at the front and long at the back. The ideas he came up with are nothing now but back then, we thought it was so cool. The A-Team - Who could forget the famous Hannibal, Murdoch and Mr-T? Mr-T was probably the first person to make 'bling-bling' famous.  Knight Rider - Again, who could ever forget the famous black car that you can have a conversation with, defend himself with the built-in gadgets and also jump when you press the turbo button? Not to mention the flashy red LED lights. That catchy tune starts when you see KIT cruising on a dusty road (or is it a desert?) with that stupid "woo-woo" sound when they show the flashing lights at the front. That just cracks me up now.  Dynasty, Dallas, Knots Landing - Ah... the soaps back then. Notice how filthy rich people (and their antics) were in. But being the 80's and all, the script (now we noticed) was so corny. And don't forget the fashion! Puffed up shoulders and tiny waists were in. And the hair, the more hairspray the better.   We all noticed that we just ended up watching these shows because our mothers/sisters/aunties etc were watching them as well. Besides, we did find the shows amusing back then.

						   Sigh, it seemed like ages since we last met. Come to think of it, it's been exactly 6 months. We met on New Year's together with Pat & Chen Hoe. Time flies really fast these days. Met up with Janice & Dylan at Chilli's in KLCC over lunch today. She has changed her image apparently cos she's going off to Sweden soon to attend her sister's wedding. You look good, Jan! Pat also joined us, looking like he just woke up. Lucky b******! Anyway, the food that we ordered arrived late. And since I was pressing for time, I had to just gobble everything down in 5 minutes and then rush off to the office. Really not good for digestion today. No wonder some people can get heartburn and ulcers.   After work, drove to Mid-Valley and met up with Janice, Dylan, Selina, Pat & Chen Hoe. Managed to check out some new threads in Zara and it looked like there were more clothes there than there were in OneUtama. Sigh, just have to wait till the credit card comes then I could splurge on some good Zara threads. Back in reality, by the time I arrived, the guys were having coffee at Starbucks and the girls were still shopping. What else is new? Hehehe... Then the girls came with the usual shopping bags. After much deliberation of where to have dinner, in the end, we had dinner at Secret Recipe. Honestly, bad choice, bad food. Dylan had to go home for a while before picking Janice up and drive her back to Batu Pahat. During dinner, it was so amusing to see Pat playing with his new toy, a beanie cow. It's okay Pat. We have our days like that. Hehehe... Dylan arrived and we said our goodbyes to Janice. She won't be coming back till the end of the month and will only stay in Malaysia for a few days before flying off to Canberra. So we wouldn't know if we'll see each other again when she comes back. Take care Jan. Enjoy your trip to Sweden! Sigh, I miss her already....

						   What a fantastic day it has been! Arrived at Berjaya Times Square at 9.30am and met up with Dina (my sista!) and the contestants from Workshop 3. It was so good to meet them. After all, it has been a while since the last time I met was when we were in the Top 30 briefing with Ahmad Izham Omar. As always, all of us including Paul Moss hopped into our Malaysian Idol van and we were off to Bukit Jalil for the TV3 'Sure Heboh' Carnival. Apparently this carnival is in its second year and it has been attracting a lot of people, especially thoses residing outside of KL. I didn't manage to go last year but it looked like it was a bigger affair this year.  We arrived in style, being escorted by the 8TV people and all. It felt so different now that people actually recognise us. Throughout the day, we made 3 appearances: 1) At the Blue Hyppo booth, each of us were introduced and we had to sing a snippet of a song of our choice. And then we had to take groups photos with the public. 2) At the TV3 'Sure Heboh' stage, we were introduced again and sing a song. 3) At the TMNet booth, Dina and I were interviewed for being the first 3 finalists. Too bad Vick couldn't come or he would have rocked the house. But it looked like Saiful had the most attention that day. It was so amusing to see him pose for the cameras.  By 3pm, we left the place and headed back to Berjaya Times Square because the Workshop 3 contestants needed to get ready for their live results show. I wish them all the best!  10.30pm: The results are in. Here are the top 3 from the third workshop: 1) Jac - highest votes! 2) Saiful 3) Fahmy  Congratulations to them and welcome to the finals!! Personally I feel sad cos Farah did not get thru to the finals. I'm a bit biased because she is a dear friend of mine. Heard that she got into the Wildcard round. I really hope she gets thru.  Well, now that Fahmy is in, I'm beginning to get paranoid of my choice of song now. After a few panicky phone calls to my friends, I decided that I will stick to the song (since I will be singing it differently anyway) and let fate (or more like the Malaysian public) decide. After all, it's already too late to change the song so I'll just try my best. Seriously, I have nothing against Fahmy for getting into the finals with that song. He did it his style and he got in. It was the same way I got in, by singing 'My Baby You' in my own style. Good thing Zanim made a very good point. How did I get thru to the finals with a Marc Anthony classic when that song is already relatively old and had been sung by so many people? True that! I just have to sing the song in my own style. We'll see what happens...  For now, there are 7 guys and 2 girls. Hmmm.... tough competition between the guys, I must say. Heard that in the Wildcard round, we will see all the girls battling against each other. I would reckon that there's going to be a battle of the divas! Hehehe... quite interesting, I must say. It's not even the finals yet.
