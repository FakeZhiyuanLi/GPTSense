      i don't know where to go now i'd move on but i don't know how everytime i head down this road i end up in this place with no east no west no foward no back just an empty lonely space  i'm standing here, waiting here won't you open your blind eyes? i'm standing here, waiting here can't you see through my disguise? i'm standing here waiting here standing here waiting for you standing here right in front of you  you've been here a time or two and i just smile and i just nod and though i seem, i seem to be calm i don't know what to do i'm too afraid to take a step and change the role the role i play and though i know i'll never know i wonder anyway  and i'm standing here, waiting here won't you open your blind eyes? I'm standing here, waiting here please see through my disguise i'm standing here waiting here standing here waiting for you standing here right in front of you  i doubt you'll ever understand i doubt you'll ever, ever know i doubt i'll ever give you the chance to see these words i'd like to show but i'm hoping that you see them hoping that you read them hoping that you hear this song hoping you can prove me wrong hoping someday you will realize the hope in my perfectly honest lies  -alex

YOu kids are funny. CHeerio my good band mates!&nbsp;let the music live on .

      Ok heres a recap of everything i learned today. I hope in doing this, you all learn a little something too!  1. Di can be replaced with Bi in the prefix for things meaning two. THerefore, you can ride your dicycle down to the computer store and try to crack the DInary code. Or, you can can gamble your luck and roll the bice. With this discovery i plan to make DILLIONS! muah hah ahaha Ill write about it in my diography.  2. ALso, I learned that news channels have slants. FOX = conservative according to the all knowing insane running (cross country? anyone) mrs. kneist. I also had no idea that people under the age of 50 actually watch the news on a daily basis. I mean wow. I am so undereducated. My plan is to go the library and check out the daily news from the last 5 years, just so that i can keep up. Like "hey bob! member that one drunk driver/murder/gun at school back in 95!" "what a story that was!" - yeah, then ill be cool .  3. Finally, I learned that both romania and transylvania are ACTUAL countries. NOT only that, but the romania one is in the oylmpics. Whichcan only mean one thing.  urlLink http://www.megocentral.com/customs/mtjaycust/image/lee_dracula_1.jpg  Dracula has to be real. People - watch your necks. THe myth is FACT

      Ok so i know you must be wondering. Shes online all the time, but never seems to blog. THere are multiple reasons for this. Now that i know that someone may ACTUALLY read this, there is a lot of pressure to live up to. First off you have alex, pro blogger, always creating witty blogs that keep readers on the edge of their seats, yes even bitting the nails. Then Steve, who, through humerous short stories, tends to induce a laughing session beyond comprehenision. THen Katie -- shes like the old shoe that just gets thrown to the dog because wearing it would be far too embarressing. Now as i dwell on my day, i realize that nothing entertaining happens, at least nothing worth talking about. I mean i wake up. i pitter patter around. go to school. Ok granted Calhouns class is a nice humor break, but still, nothing to talk about. So instead of stories or fun thoughts, i have decided to blog the things i learn each day. Because most people learn a least one thing a day, minimum.  Today I learned  contrary to popular belief, under 15 seniors stay for lunch. As you can imagine, i often walk around aimlessly  I also learned that i don't do well with unstructured activies. I hate to admit this and would love to say that im the kind of girl who just eases through and doesn't really mind which direction things are headed, but why lie to myself. I need direction.  So if you want me to do something, just lay it out black and white. KATIE WASH MY CAR.  poof, done.

      Ok so HOW long has it been? Months? Years? I can't even remember. First off, I wanna give a big HAPPY BIRDTHDAY to the one and only malex fay. Second, Steve, it must be the pimp juice, every girl wants a piece. And third, I just want to let everyone know that Mexico is the place to be. None of that gringo mexico, im talking the real deep south, the heart of the country. Where you can only eat quesidillas and beef, and drink bubbly water, with absolutely no taste. Muy Muy fun. In fact i think i might be fluent in spanish now? OLE  Alex I thought you might be interested to know that taking back sunday is coming to town, in like september. DOnt really know when where what time or anything, but use your research skills im sure youll track it down.  Also does it disturb anyone that we waited over an hour to cross the border ( my little white family ) But a very large tour bus just zipped right on through. I mean they confiscated our coconuts that we bought because , i dunno, they are dangerous? but a whole bus load is just like CYYYYYAAAAAAAA. lame.
