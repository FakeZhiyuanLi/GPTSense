      LUKAS SCHWARZACHER (Variety) TOKYO Traditionally, Japanese summer fairs and festivals that start in the evening and last until the small hours are called "matsuri."  Leave it to Fuji Television Network to bring the venerable custom into the modern world of movies. Its first seven-day Movie King event runs from Aug. 21 in the wide-open area of Odaiba along Tokyo's waterfront, which houses Fuji TV's headquarters. The fest is an extravaganza to consolidate Fuji TV's already strong status as Japan's foremost movie-oriented network. Highlights include special-edition screenings of "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Lucasfilm has granted exclusive approval for the screenings, the first since their theatrical release here in 1997. A preview of "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" with an appearance by star Milla Jovovich ( urlLink news ) plus a Stephen Chow Night featuring "Shaolin Soccer" and the popular Hong Kong thesp himself complement screenings of Fuji TV-produced pics to be released later this year. Among those are Shinji Aoyama's psycho-thriller "Lakeside Murder Case," and "Swing Girls" by Shinobu Yaguchi ("Waterboys") about an all-girl high school big band, both favorites among this fall's releases. Odaiba houses one of Tokyo's most modern multiplexes, the Mediage Cinema, host to most of the showings. To top it off, all 24 parts of season three of TV skein "24" will be screened back-to-back, with only one brief intermission. This calls for some sake afterwards. "It's all about fun and about building up our brand," explains Chihiro Kameyama, head of Fuji TV's motion picture department and chief organizer of Movie King. Although not an official film festival, the event could establish itself as Tokyo's prime audience-oriented film event of the year. Given the continuing struggle of the Tokyo Intl. Film Festival for relevance and public acceptance, the competition from across town could become stronger than wished for. "It's an interesting concept, and Fuji TV has the power to pull in the crowds," observes a film distribution exec. Being part of the all-summer Adventure King festival and amusement park staged annually by Fuji TV also helps. Last year's installment of this assortment of Fuji TV content-based attractions chalked up 3.5 million visitors over less than two months.

      Hey guys today I had a good day. I am trying to sell some of my web templates. When I grow up I am really thinking about being a computer designer or animater. I am also trying to learn PHP, MYsql, HTML, XHTML. I really want to get into coding because I am doing more designing than coding. So I end up having lots of Templatess instead of coding them to.

      Jay-Z and R. Kelly Plan Fall Tour(AP, 08/24/2004 3:49 PM) Jay-Z and R. Kelly are going back in time. Their planned 2002 tour never materialized because of child pornography charges against Kelly. Now they're set to open "The Best of Both Worlds" tour Sept. 30 in Chicago. The U.S. tour, which takes its name from their 2002 album, will travel to more than 40 cities before ending in Phoenix on Nov. 28. They appeared together last year at Jay-Z's concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, faces 14 counts of child pornography in Chicago and has pleaded innocent. In March, prosecutors in Florida dropped all 12 child pornography charges against Kelly, 37, after a judge ruled that photos allegedly showing the R&amp;B singer having sex with an underage girl were illegally seized. Kelly's new album, "Happy People/U Saved Me," was released Tuesday. His hits include "Ignition," "Step in the Name of Love" and the Grammy-winning "I Believe I Can Fly." Jay-Z, 34, is the leading nominee for the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards with six nominations for his jarring video for "99 Problems," which depicts his own murder as a metaphor for his retirement from rapping. The awards will be presented Sunday in Miami. ___ On the Net:  urlLink http://www.r-kelly.com/

      Britney & Beau's Video Wedding(E! Online, 08/24/2004 4:00 PM) By Lia Haberman Britney Spears is immortalizing her hot 'n' heavy romance with Kevin Federline by putting him in her new video. Federline, a backup dancer by trade, will star in the pop tart's new clip--a cover of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative." The track is one of two new-ish songs to be included on Spears' greatest hits album in stores Nov. 16. (N.B., Britney: Bennifer commemorated its love in "Jenny From the Block" and look how that turned out.) Scheduled to debut in early September, the video will feature Spears dressed in a wedding gown and walking down the aisle with Federline. According to People, she'll also be seen in her undies--after cutting off the straps of her wet dress with a kitchen knife because she's driven her car into a pool. (Don't you hate when that happens.) Writing on Spears' official Website, her mom, Lynne, says the video is being shot at the historic Paramour estate in Los Angeles and will feature lots of close-ups, since the Britster's bum knee still hasn't completely healed. It will also be a family affair. As Lynne writes, "Please look for that good looking hunk of a son of mine in the video--he has a cameo right at the beginning." Mama Spears has also been helping the young lovers shop for a new house ever since they returned from a "relaxing trip" to Lake Tahoe. (Rough life. Didn't they just return from an R&amp;R retreat in Hawaii?) Meanwhile, the video isn't the only Spears-Federline coproduction on the horizon. Along with their impending real-life nuptials, reportedly slated for November, the happy couple is reportedly interested in starring in their own Newlyweds series on MTV. With Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson 's second anniversary approaching and Jessica pouting to Us Weekly that she's through living in the music network's fishbowl 24/7, the New York Post reported that Spears wants to pick up the reality series slack and make her no-name fianc famous in the process--after all, he does have two children to support. MTV has denied having any talks with Spears, however, and Joe Simpson, Jessica's dad and manager, has said the original Newlyweds couple will return for one more season of TV bliss. Or maybe Lynne and Joe can just duke it out?
