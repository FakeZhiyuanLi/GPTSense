      The boys are back in town...  Well I am back from a very "educational" (hehe to people who know what that means) and fun trip from Boston. Boston is an extremely beautiful place and I recommend that all people should go there before they die. But unfortunately I am not in the mood for blogging and if you interested in talking about it give me a jingle. You know the digits and if not just ask!

      Everyone quits their first job.   Working gives me the sense of how do you say-----yuck. I mean honestly if the world didn't have money or material items I think it would be a better place. Who really needs that top notch car or those fancy mechanical pencils...not I! I for one, would be happier without all these things. Everyone would be equal and wouldn't have to work stupid jobs and wear "interesting" outfits to work in. I experienced my first taste of the working world this weekend. And it stinks. But the one advantage is meeting new people and I did like that (along with the free food benifits). I guess truely the only part I hated about it was the fact that I had to keep on my fake smile for the customers so all would be happy, because lets face it no one wants to buy a elephant ear from a sad frowny person. Oh and did I forget to mention that I am a carnie? Yes, it looks that way.    Going on the whole smiling-makes-the-worldgo-'round-and-money-come-in attitude that the people of Bojo's seem to have has made me realize that we segreate. Really now folks, how many carnies selling elephant ears have you seen with piercings and spiked hair? I know I haven't seen many, not one. Well maybe I should change that. Would I get fired? Would I set a fire with my crazy spiked hair and all the hairspray that would be necessary to keep those spikes in? Who knows. But all I know is that I want to change that. For all you spikey haired punk like people I represent you and truely in my heart root for you to get that job over me! I believe in you! But I must say that the one true punk-like person that gets a job everytime because she is loved by all is Rachel Cherny. That girl has skills! Everyone loves her, so all you punks listen up and follow by her example and soon enough you too can make money and join the rest of us wokring people in the real world! What fun I'll see ya there!    So truely the lesson of my experience has been:   If you want a job, you better not be a punk!

      C.O.O.L-Constipated, Outta style, Outrageous, Loser  I believe that in life it's too short to become something that your not. You shouldn't go on living the life that was made for someone else, live your own life. Don't be what your friends want you to be, but instead be you. Giving up into peer pressure is one thing, but when you go on doing it to be cool, it's just plain outta-style. Live the life you want to remember 20 years from now and not regret it. Sure you may lose some friends in this process, but if they didn't know you as this person then they never really were you friends. You'll make new ones, better than the old. Be who you are, because God knows being cool won't get you anywhere.

      A picture holds a 1000 words.  Today was a lazy day, chilling with Kayli and watching home movies last night until 4:00 in the morning. After volleyball I became lazy and felt like looking into my past. I opened my pictures from old dances and turned on a little bit of Yellowcard--One Year, Six Months, and other good gazing-at-photo songs. Looking into these pictures and the great memories that they hold I wish I could relive the moment. But, I can't. The people within those pictures and memories have changed and I know we will all eventually go our own ways as life goes on but I hate thinking about that now. Honestly, when I am an old woman living in my little tiny house on a hill will I look back and remember the good..or the bad. The changes that certain people made in my life for the better or for the worse. Who will I still be friends with, if any when I'm older. If stats are correct which they usually are at least 5 people in our class will die before we graduate. Think about that how scary is that fact. There will be at least 5 less people that we are with now at graduation. Who will those people be? Will they be close to me, or will I have barely knew them? With all of these thoughts rushing through my head at the computer needless to say I was a bit freaked out. So the conclusion of this is that truely some people will change your life, be it for the better or worse. Who will those people be, you are the only one who can determine that. So get out there and meet those people, get off your butt and off my blog! Live life to the fullest and never look back wishing you had done something that you didn't.

      Until the day I die I'll spill my heart for you.  I felt the need to add another thought into the blog. I find the amount of relationships at our school amazing. Some last the period of days to a month while other couples seem to make it into the long haul. And I find that as of right now to this to be one of the most amazing things. As of this point in my life I would like that addition, but don't feel the true need. Sure it would be awsome to have that "special someone" now, but I just can't seem to get around to it. Yes, there are guys that I like, or think are cute, but I just can't seem to get to them. You see, (I have tried to explain this to a few people as follows) my "love life" if one can call it that, is like a highway. There are the occasional cars that drive by, you check out, and they just keep driving and you know that you don't have a chance, because naturally you are in your slow turtle like car, whereas they've got the rabbit. But, sooner or later there will be that right, fellow turtle car for me that will pull up and let me jump in. And hopefully not take the nearest exit.

      It's the little things in life that make living grand.  And taking finals is not one of the little things that I enjoy. Whoever came up with these packets of hell as I like to call them is just plain cruel. Especially the cumulative types of tests, like Chem. Honestly, what a joke...teachers expect us to remember things from last Semester. I don't think so. So needless to say, I probably didn't do very well on that final. Along with any of the others I will be taking this Semester. I have just gotten to the point where I don't care anymore. As I was going through the Spanish (which I knew none of) and Chem test I thought to myself so what if I don't do well. These grades should be based on the homework, tests and other grades that we get throughout that Semester. Finals are whack and I'll leave it at that.

      Going down with this ship.  Finals studying today can really be a drag. Thanks to Shawn, Chris, and Joe they made the journey more enjoyable! The library is an interesting place and while in it I has one burning question. Seeing a man walk by me and get overly excited about a movie in the section we were sitting in I was curious. First thing that pops up in my mind. Does the library rent out porn. Because honestly, who gets that excited over library movies. Think about this one. Can the library rent out porn, and if so how do you ask for it. Umm, hi. I was wondering if you had any movies that featured female and male mating or reproduction for that matter? Now I'm not one who is into the whole porn craze...I've actually never seen it. Don't get me wrong it's probably great for all you people who enjoy that sorta thing, but personally I'm not a fan. Is that weird, no just personal opinion. If anyone knows the answer to this question I am interested in hearing it. I will not think anything but the best of you so please enlighten me.  On the other hand I had my first day of Softball for Lisle Slammers with Kayli and Erika today. And let me tell you, it was an experience. Another question happened to pop into my head today while there. The randomness of it is actually relevant. Is it possible to get bugs away from you, or for that matter off of an entire field. That would be some kinda invention. A spray or candle big enough to emitt a vapor to get rid of these bugs. Just for about an hour or two. Because honestly, they've gotta go.

      Seeing is Believing.  Life is a mysterious thing if you thing about it. You live your life trying to make the world a better place, not knowing what your purpose truely is. Yet everyday you keep on going hopeing for a better tomorrow. After a long time of many tomorrows you have lived your life and that is all you can do. But what really happens after that? Sure, there is a heaven. Now I'm not trying to be anti-god, because I am a Catholic and do attend church. But how does anyone really know? Where will we go when we die? What are my hopes and dreams? Will I live to fufill them in the short amount of time that God has placed me on this earth? Am I living how I should be or am I off course or gone astray? This blog will be with me to experience these things and live the life I'm living now. So good luck and god's speed.

       ok lets face it computers suck!    I wrote an amazing beyond amazing thing for you all to read while I was gone, and I lost it. So I shall have to start again.    My family:   They say that I am a mediocre person and that I will never make it into college. Yes, I may not have any skills, or go to modeling school for my looks but I am persistent on getting into a college. We also fight all the time I am but a rebellious child which some of you reading this laugh at, but it is sadly true. I hate family life and want to run away from all of this shit! Fight makes me angry and so does the world! I just can't stand them when I am around them and they piss me off. I think I might be bipolar for this reason alone, along with my development of adhd.  College:  I have a college interested in me a division 3, but I have no clue as to what I want to do with this. I think, for right now, that I want to major in business and minor in journalism, but who knows. College really stresses me out with all of the searching that I am doing, because let's face it this is the biggest decision I will be making for a long time. It's my future and I don't have all the money in the world to go and change what I want to do at the drop of a hat. So basically I am screwed!  Friend/Summer:  Lack there of is more like it. I have been spending my time with the most awsome 2 people that I know, Kayli and Katy. We have had a blast, but sadly I remember better times last summer and I miss the group crowd scene. Even if we were only hanging out at someone's house the group of us I miss that. And probably won't be getting that back! But for the rest of the summer I plan on making it the best and am looking for new summer fun pals to join the 3 some over here. I WILL make your time a worth while one because let's face it, I have little time to make this the best summer ever!  So all there was much more that I want to comment on, but don't have time to dinner and packing for Ohio. So when I get back (AUG. 1ST--AKA FUN PALS) Don't be shy and be sure to call. I will be waiting to hear from all of you!   As for now farewell and I leave you with lyrics:    People see right through you   Everyone who knew you well   Falls apart, might as well   Day is long and nothing is wasteful   Runaway runaway  This is what I am wanting to do right now.........

      Ok, How's this for a thought....  So far I think that I have gone on living by living a lie. I think that I am someone that I am not supposed to be. I go one everyday thinking thoughts about doing things I shouldn't and wishing I was places that I am not. Is this the lie many people go on living everyday or am I an exception to the rule? Should I break out of the "Naperville bubble" and live the way I want. Or should I live the life I dream of for a day and then go on living after that the same old way? I know that the things I wish to do are wrong and not what my friends are doing, but honestly it has been thought about all the time. Yes, it's wrong and I know it, but what if the feelings come on stronger every time I try to ignore it? What do I do then? Continue with this lie? Live in my bubble?   The randomness of this blog may truly be random, but something that is constantly nagging me. Apologies to all that may worry when they see this it is truly not something to dwell on, but if you know what I mean then you obviously know where I'm coming from.

      Can't worry about tomorrow's pain tonight Alright...............   Life is something that people don't think most about. In the long run as I have come to realize people don't worry about the future they live life day by day. I'm starting to think that this is the way to live. Don't worry about the consequences that you will face tomorrow before the sun rises today.   It makes sense really why worry about the things that you can't change, grades, lost friends, mistakes, lost loves and whatnot. It's in your past forget about it. Live life in the best way possible. Surround your self with good friends.   The one other thing I can't seem to grasp right now are feelings. So if this blog seems weird, appologies. I'm just sorting out many things in my head. Such as what do I want compared to what others want for me. And things that I can't explain. That and finally the things that I have lost through out the period of a year. Friends and groups of people, my innocence and my old sense of mentality. What happened to these things within the course of a year I don't know. But I do know that it has to do with the people I am around or was around and can't get them out of my head.   To some I miss you to others I'm glad you're gone.

      Shit stinks, Arrid works..  I finding myself in a mix of personalities lately. I am many different people all at different times. When I'm with certain people I change. I guess everyone does this, but I have a problem. It's not normal when I mix groups, I get confused on who I am supposed to be and my personalities combine into a super personality {ps not good}. It's tricky I'm all confused and find myself in a bit of an identity crisis.    If you think you know me please help me out and tell me who I am to you, thanks.  Sad but I sound like a lost puppy ad......

      Sometimes it's hard to explain the way we feel    Surrounded by peer pressure and what it's like to be cool can be a challenge sometimes. With the constant need to fit in I find myself slowly drifting away into my other self. I've found a way to get this out in a written form by expressing myself through poetry and other forms. This actually is quite relaxing and helps me escape into another person for that time being.   By doing this every night before bed can be quite stress relieving and get all my problems out. Through this I can tell my stories as if viewed by another person. The life I live when not around is there and I am telling other peoples' stories.  For a day I recommend this, try being someone else through writing and you will see what I mean.

      Some times people surprise me in ways unexplainable.   Some seem more mature for their age while others seem the opposite. Some people you will see a completely different side in while you are with them talking one on one whereas you see them in the group scene. Other people can truly let me down from how I have known them in the past to what they are now. But either way I have made a vow with myself to start over and be a new person. I am going to accept all of the people in the past that I haven't and I plan on making a ton of new friends, older and wiser, who I can just hang with and have a blast. Either way I am going to be more open-minded and try to stay this way while being with and meeting people.  Another random thought came to my mind today. There are days that I think people don't really know me. I mean honestly I know me and I think that the people I am with think they know be but, (to use a cliché) they don't have any idea. As I said previously posted I might be bipolar, but then after watching Secret Window I wonder if I could possibly be schizophrenic. Yes I am over exaggerating, but truly there are different sides of me that people haven't seen. When they do they might not even know me and if that other side ever comes out it might be interesting to see if people still hang with me, or if it will bring out a new crowd.   So for now I will slowly bring out the new me and yes you too will be surprised at first, soon grow to love it.   And I think from now on I will leave the blog with a few words of advice, be them serious or otherwise...  According to William S. Burroughs:    People often ask me if I have any words of advice for young people. Well here are a few simple admonitions for young and old. Never interfere in a boy-and-girl fight. Beware of whores who say they don't want money. The hell they don't. What they mean is they want more money. Much more. If you're doing business with a religious son-of-a-bitch, Get it in writing. His word isn't worth shit. Not with the good lord telling him how to fuck you on the deal.  Avoid fuck-ups. We all know the type. Anything they have anything to do with, No matter how good it sounds, Turns into a disaster. Do not offer sympathy to the mentally ill. Tell them firmly: I am not paid to listen to this drivel. You are a terminal boob.  Now some of you may encounter the Devil's Bargain, If you get that far. Any old soul is worth saving, At least to a priest, But not every soul is worth buying. So you can take the offer as a compliment. He tries the easy ones first. You know like money, All the money there is. But who wants to be the richest guy in some cemetery? Money won't buy. Not much left to spend it on, eh gramps? Getting too old to cut the mustard.  Well time hits the hardest blows. Especially below the belt. How's a young body grab you? Like three card monte, like pea under the shell, Now you see it, now you don't. Haven't you forgotten something, gramps? In order to feel something, You've got to be there. You have to be eighteen. You're not eighteen. You are seventy-eight. Old fool sold his soul for a strap-on.  Well they always try the easiest ones first. How about an honorable bargain? You always wanted to be a doctor, Well now's your chance. Why don't you become a great healer? And benefit humanity? What's wrong with that? Just about everything. Just about everything. There are no honorable bargains Involving exchange Of qualitative merchandise Like souls For quantitative merchandise Like time and money. So piss off Satan And don't take me for dumber than I look.  An old junk pusher told me - Watch whose money you pick up.
