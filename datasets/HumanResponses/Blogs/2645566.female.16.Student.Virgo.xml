      I know that I haven't really been writing lately...but alot has been going on.   So this post is just to tell Tori thanks. You're there for me when I need you most and I don't even have to ask. Especially today, you took your time and spent it with me just because I was having a bad day. I can't thank you enough. You are the bestest.

      turns out that "holding steady" and "stabilized" means "in a coma and going quickly." my great-grandfather died on thursday night.   molly got here on friday. i had so much fun with her. she really needs to move back. she's one of my best friends and i hate the fact that she lives so freakin' far away.

      recieved a call at 10 til 7 this morning. it was as follows:  "I just wanted to call to tell you that grampa is holding steady"  That was the important part. I wish he would just die so he was no longer in pain.

      They took my grandpa off the hydration tubes. They are going to give him morphene to alleviate the pain...that's all they can do...they've given him less than a week.  I HATE THIS!!! Who are "they"?! Who are they to let my grandfather die?! Don't they know that he's important to me, to my gramma, and great-gramma? To my entire FAMILY???  It's not fair.

      My great-grandfather is in the hospital again. This time they say that it is inevitable. He will soon pass.   This all started because of his damn seizures...why God? Why do I have to loose someone so close to my heart? If he hadn't had that seizure, he wouldn't have broken his hip. It wouldn't have resulted in this mess.   He can't swallow anymore. They are keeping him hydrated through an i.v. His living will demands that a feeding tube not enter his system. The doctors diagnosed that we will loose our loved one in a matter of no more than a month.   I hate not being there for my grandma...I hate not being there for my great-grandma. I hate not being there for my Grandpa Fred who only has limited time left on this world.   There will be no funeral. Grandpa Fred will be cremated and his ashes will be spread at sea. They are going to try to spread his ashes at the same longitude/latitude that they spread my aunt from. I love my grandpa. I wish I was there.    Another soul was lost yesterday. Dustin...Deborah's son. Family friends. Dustin shot himself in the head earlier Saturday morning. It's horrible...he was trying to sell that very gun one day prior. He was only 16. That's my age for goodness sakes.   In closing: This is a cruel and hateful world that we call home.

      This weekend was...a blast. Thursday afternoon we left for Mid-state and honestly, I didn't want to go. But boy am I glad that I did. The ride up to M'boro was interesting to say the least. Drew, wow, and Alex...man. Rooming with Leah and Andrea was great. It allowed me to get closer to two people that I considered friends...but weren't that close to. The first night we watched a movie and kaci came in (our rooms were connected..FUN STUFF). The next we stayed up until the wee hours of the morning just talking about whatever came to mind. It was great. I got to see people from other cities...friends...that I never get the opportunity to talk to. And that was just the beginning.  Rehearsals were hilarious, tedious, tiring, fun, exciting, etc. I don't know what was more funny: the fact that our conductor was old and didnt get a pattern and got excited over little things or the people that I was sitting around making fun of him. Either way, the music was great (minus one piece) and it was worth going. I'm glad I went.  Explanation of my name: On the way up to Mid-state, I had for some reason touched Drew's hair...a very rough experience. He said that all it would need was some conditioner..but he doesn't bother with that. Then he proceeded to say that a "friendly" shower would help as well. That would include a shower with a girl...hmm...interesting. So we joked about that for the whole weekend. Finally we concluded that "conditioning" meant having sex in the shower. So, "Man I need to condition!" would mean, "Man I need to have sex in the shower!"...good times...not having sex in the shower, but talking about that whole process...shutting up now.

      Wake up. Go to school. Leave school. Come home. Sleep. That's my day in a nutshell. You would think that after so many years of the same thing that something would change. I have a wonderful boyfriend, but I don't get to see him due to the fact that he lives in Manchester. It costs a little too much for us to drive 20 miles every day so we can see each other. So that leaves barely any options for the afternoon. Spend time with friends, do homework, come home. That's what I usually do but you can only do that so much. I find myself devouring my time with books and stories (usually stupid little things that will not benefit my being at all). Maybe leaving for mid-state on Thursday will have a positive effect on me. At least I will be spending time with different people from all over middle Tennessee. I vow to make the most out of Thursday, Friday and Saturday...my midstate experiance for this year. Now I will just go off and read...hoping for time to hurry and pass along so I can see Paul tomorrow. Then I'm off....

      What do you do when your whole day is centered around your baby cousin? Okay..so maybe it wasn't my *whole* day but it was close enough.  Last night I had to go over to Brookie's (4 years old) house to see her "Ch-ch-ch-chia" pet that she was making. The sweet little thing wouldn't let me leave until I promised her that I would take her out to lunch today. So now that the scene is set...here's the story:  I arrived back home from Tori's house at around 9:30. Two hours and counting until I had to pick Brookie up at her house for lunch. Finally got over to her house at around 11:45 to have an anxious little girl waiting for my arrival. She ran to the door, opened it and practically dragged me into the house so we could leave. Brookie's choice for lunch -- good ol' Mickey D's... and of course, like every little kid, she insisted on playing. So I spent a good 2 hours in McDonald's today. After that escapade we returned to my house. After many protests from the munchkin, I finally get to take her home. *end scene 1*  So now I'm home...resting...before I have to meet everyone at China Wok. I fell asleep on the couch. Smart me. I woke up at 4:35 and I had to be at the restaurant at 4:45 (no one ever credited me with being the brightest crayon in the box). And (just my luck) on the way there, I get stuck behind a truck going 25 mph in a 35 mph zone. I was too close to shooting myself. Dinner, once I got there, was a great experience. It was Ashley, Tori, Emily Em., Kerry, Cody, and I. I think it was even better because Emily was actually able to come. It's really nice to be able to see her again. So we are sitting around the table and good ol' Tori decides to call Paul for me (which is really funny because she just screams his name into her phone and it automatically dials it)...He actually wanted to do something! so the plan was that he would meet me at my house sometime after 7. ~later~ everyone has a great time and departs on good terms. *end scene 2*  I pull into my driveway and there's an extra car at my house. Relatives. *enter Brookie* Yes, they were at my house to watch the Titans game...but whenever MY family is together, the process is relatively the same: Torture Cassi. Tonight was 100% lighter on the adults behalf (too engrossed in the game)...but sweet little Brookie took an immediate liking to Paul. So when Paul and I went into the other room to watch a movie...we have a tag-a-long. Paul and I also make the mistake of kissing in her presence ("I was getting ready to leave the room because you guys were kissing!") "Psst...Cassi...are you in love with Paul?" (she's very intelligent...no one knows where she got it from) "Yes, Brooklyn, I am," I responded. "Good, 'cause Paul is in love with Cassi too." (he's such a sweetie) ~short while later~*enter Lori, Brookie's mom* "Psst...Mommy...Cassi is in love with Paul." "Really?? And is Paul in love with Cassi?"  "Yup!" So naturally, now my whole family knows how head over heels I am for this guy...and vice versa. "how sweet" you may say? You don't know my family. I will *never* live this one down.  'Night.

      Okay, first of all...I just want to see if this will work. I hope it does because I am going to proceed in telling about last night.  Last night was...crazy. Instead of sitting around and waiting for Paul to call (like I usually do), Tori and I took matters into our own hands and decided to go out on a date. Ruby Tuesday's here we come! Sitting there, we begin to talk about whatever happens to come to mind. There was lots of laughing. Then our waitress comes to get our drink order...2 suicide lemonades. Not 2 minutes later, she returns..."Can I see your i.d.'s?" What?! We just wanted a mixture of kiwi, blackberry, and strawberry lemonades. *insert mad laughing* Then comes our dessert...Chocolate Tallcake. *yum* Throughout the rest of the night many jokes were made. "That guy's tall and lanky...Oh D*mn!" "STAND UP and PLEASE tell me there's a truck there!" (Tori thought she was hallucinating...there was a pillar blocking my line of vision to where the truck actually was...turned out to be quite humorous) "Look at me Weena!""I thought he was just a retarded kid." (The family next to us had a baby...the elder kid was trying to get the baby's attention for a picture. The baby's name was Hannah or Anna...but we heard "Weena")...Many great memories came from Ruby Tuesdays...Stuff that, at least for now, Tori and I can keep laughing about. And you may not think it's funny...but I guess you had to be there. Or maybe it was just the fact that we were spending that time together that made it better.   Either way, I'm glad that I got to spend that time with Tori last night. It was definately better than sitting at home. And in a way I feel as if it has drawn us both together...more so then we were prior to that experiance. I'm glad that I have a friend like Tori that I can open up to about whatever is troubling me..or whatever is on my mind...or even for the times that I am *truly* happy and need to tell *someone* about my experiance...someone that won't hold it against me. Thank you Tori for being there for me. I appreciate it more than you will ever know.

      Now folks, don't let the title fool you. I still am in a wonderful relationship with the man I love. Now that that is understood, I will explain. Everytime we are together we always end up tickling one another. He will say "HEY NOW!" and then I will chime in with it as well. So we were sitting around one day and he said "Hey now" and I said "hey nooow" like in the song. But we didn't know what song it was. Now we do. That's the story. You probably think it's stupid, but it means a lot to me.   Yesterday was...well, I don't know what it was exactly. In the morning, Paul and Chris came over and Chris watched Jordan while Paul, my mom and I went to Winchester to see The Passion of the Christ (the movie was indescribable; I can't believe one person would give up so much just to cleanse those yet to come...wow guys, wow.) After that was over we came home and had lunch. Then Paul went home and the rest of us *attempted* to go to M'boro. You see, we were gonna go get a prom dress for me (didn't work out) but my car kept dying on the freeway. My car sucks. So now my car is going to have to go to the shop and they will have it for who knows HOW long. And it really sucks being dependant on people for rides once you know what it's like to have that freedom. Suxors bigtime.  Today was a whole lotta nothin. Went to Donut Palace then to church. After church I went out to eat with Paul and his dad and little brother. That was interesting. It was also kinda sad because I don't get to see Paul until next weekend. *maybe* So that really stinks. I usually get to see him on Wednesday nights for a good 3 hours at least, but the stupid Colemans had to go and schedule concert festival forthat day. And it's just my luck that we wont get home until 10 or 10:30 AT NIGHT! Ugh...  So all in all...this weekend was interesting..boring..dull...gosh I hope I have a better week than I did weekend.

      Tonight was great. I got to spend time with Emadian. Now there is something that I never get to do...mostly because in the past we didn't really have a way to communicate (now we have a class together). So I was supposed to do something with Paul tonight, but Emily and Allie came in this morning and told me about our original plans being sprung back into action. I had to go to Em's house. Plan was to mess around with her new keyboard (which is totally awesome!!) and then eat some grub and watch a movie. So the three of us were playin' around and enjoyed dinner together (pizza and buffalo wings *yum*). Then Allie had to leave for Spiderweb. So Em and I did what any sane person would do: pop some popcorn, grab the M&M's and these new TollHouse candy bar things, and pop in a good ol' Disney movie. The movie of choice was The Lion King 1 1/2. Talk about an adorable movie!!! Lots of laughs and sublte humor. They really tied in The Lion King well. I give it 2 thumbs up.  The most fun I had tonight was after the movie. Em and I just sat in her room and talked for a good hour and a half. We talked a lot about how our "friends" have changed. A lot of them have. Some for the better and some for the worse. It was nice to know that someone had the same view point on it as me. We aslo talked about how much certain people get on our nerves and how the past (3rd grade) was so much easier. Ya know...the simpler things: kissing on the cheek on top of the jungle gym *~!EWWW COOTIES!~* hehehe...those were the days.   Point: I'm glad that Em and I are closer now. It seems that as everyone is changing, our group in particular, certain people are drawn together...I'm glad that I can tell her anything and know that it's safe. I'm glad that I feel the same way about Tori and Chris. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have my friends there to keep me rational in the times when I need them the most. I just want to say thanks.

      So when I went to the doctor's office 2 weeks ago, they scheduled an appointment for today to make sure that I am recovering/recovered. They made the appointment for this morning at 9. So I get there and am waiting patiently. THEY FORGOT TO PUT MY APPOINTMENT INTO THE FREAKIN' COMPUTER!! So my visit became a matter of whether or not I was supposed to be there. I went to my car and brought back the appointment card (because I'm good like that). They apologized and rescheduled my appointment for next week. Good thing happened though- they gave me a doctor's excuse for the whole day. So I don't have to go back if I don't want to!! But I am gonna go for fourth.   Tomorrow--eye doctor. Woot!

      Wow, I suppose that I should put a little update on here. On last Thursday I left for Tech. That was fun stuff. I got to see a lot of people that I never get to talk to let alone see. Jesse, Tara, Kayla, Vaughn, Darren, Logan, Andrew, and Tanner were all there. Plus I made some new friends. All in all, it was good.   Saturday was Valentine's Day. Since I was still at Tech, Paul was supposed to come to my concert. He called me on Friday night and informed me that he wasn't going to be able to come. His parents wanted to go on a date of their own...which is all swell and fine in my opinion, but it was the first Valentine's Day that I have been in a relationship. So anyway...he felt really bad and we were both sad about him not being able to come. We decided that we would just celebrate on Sunday.  Sunday it snowed. Sunday it snowed...a lot! During church (a mere 1 1/2 hours) we got around 3 inches. First real snow of winter. And it comes in FEBRUARY! Well, Paul and I had planned on spending the whole day together, but because of the snow, the play we were going to see was cancelled. So after some lunch at Fazoli's...he came over. He brought me 4 roses: one pink, one yellow, one white, and one red. It was really sweet because we have been together for four months. I gave him "The Fighting Temptations" on dvd. It was the first movie that we saw together in theatre on our first date. So it meant something to both of us. ....After Paul left, Chris came over and stayed the night. It was good times.  Monday we were out of school and I went to devotions. That was nice because we didn't DO anything--no one showed  up. There was talk of merging the two devotions (i.e. bryce's idea) and somehow I think we are going to try it. >_  Yesterday, Paul and I decided to skip church. So he came over and we played around and had some jolly good fun. Woot. I gave him some brownies (the rest of his V-day present) and a letter. He gave me a stuffed monkey (SO cute!! it has a belly button!!!) and a homemade card. Good times. Then we went to church and only showed up for the last 10 minutes or so. So yeah. Paul was going to say something to Bryce..but I think he is going to wait until Sunday-ish. After church Paul actually came to the Tech concert. The symphony band and the jazz band came down here for a concert. I hope that he enjoyed it, because I did. *And that's the way we do it when we drink a lot of beer!* Thanks to Keith for that one. (oh yeah, keith was at tech too). Well, I think that is it for now. So cya!!  FINGERS!!! AHH!!!

      I don't know what was better, waking up and being able to breathe or spending the entire day with Paul...wait...that was a dumb comment. I SPENT THE WHOLE DAY WITH PAUL! Wow. It was amazing. For starters, I should say that my plan for the day was 1) go to church, 2) come home, 3) take a nap, and 4) work on my huge load of make up work. I am much happier that it turned out differently.   After church, Paul and I went to Taco Bell...simple, delicious, and something we both love. After Taco Bell was Wal-Mart, then finally my house. When we got to my house we kinda couldn't do anything because Slectues and her mom came by. They still want me to go to Florida with them this summer!!! Anyway...once they left Paul and I went and "watched" Fight Club. Good movie, but it was better just laying in his arms again (not to mention...*sigh*). I'm not going to forget the, "you better not get me sick again..." "don't worry! I can't. I'm on antibiotics." *grin*kiss* That was nice. And then there was when we were messing around with each other (play fighting):  "YOU NOT MY FRIEND NO MORE!" -me...I leave the room "That's okay...I'll find new friends."-Paul "WHAT DID YOU SAY?!"  That was followed by me pushing him into the other room ("OOH!! You're in trouble now!!" calls out my mom), pinning him on the bed ("I like being in trouble"), and kissing him senseless. Good times...Good times. So now "trouble" is on ongoing thing. Paul does everything he can to get in trouble. I really love him. He's so sweet when we are being serious.   I have no good way to end this...so ... peace.

      Ya know, I haveta admit, being sick stinks.  Tonight is Winterfest. Okay, so I wasn't really planning on going to the dance or anything, but I really wanted to go to the game. I didn't care about the school activities throughout the week. I didn't care about "spirit week." I just wanted to go to the game. And normally I wouldn't have cared. I just wanted to go because my friend is Queen!!! QUEEN!!! And I can't go...because I am sick. I mean, I even have friends that went tonight. And it wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't go because I had other plans. But no, that's not the case. I didn't go because of this crap.   I know that I will be up to my head in make-up work. I missed a good couple of tests, including a state-wide test that I don't know if I will get to make-up. I am really glad that it's not worse though. I mean, I could have had mono and Lord knows I am glad that that wasn't the case. Although, it was a good kick when I told Paul that I was planning on telling him that that was the case instead of the other stuff. I got a good laugh outta that. But I just wanna get better so I can spend time with my friends, actually go to school, and spend time with my boyfriend. Hopefully, I can get outta this jail tomorrow.

      I would just like everyone to know that being sick  *SuCkS* . Yeah. So I've been sick all week. The only day that I have gone to school is on Monday. Some would enjoy this, but not when you are *miserable*. And I didn't think it was really anything bad. Just a head cold and some nasty cough...but no. I have an ear infection in BOTH ears, some sort of throat infection with a technical name that I have never heard of, and bronchitis. Wowzers, let me tell you that it's a ton of fun! I guess the only good thing out of it is that I do *not* have mono. (hahahaha...now That was a funny conversation.)   Next week is a big week for me. On Wednesday, Paul and I will be together for 4 months. By far my longest relationship. AND! Then there's Valentine's Day on Saturday. That is going to be a new experiance for me. This is the first relationship that I have been in during any *big* holidays that you spend with the people that you love. I am really excited that I get to partake in that experiance this year. But of course, there is a downside to the upcoming week. I will be leaving town. So this is how I *hope* it will work out. By Wednesday I will be well again and will be able to spend time with Paul. Which will be a good thing because I leave Thursday afternoon. I will be gone Thursday evening, Friday (all day), and Saturday(most of the day). So that just means that Paul has to come to my concert on Saturday if he wants to see me on Valentines. If not, then we can always celebrate it on Sunday. Whichever he wants to do. I don't want to make him come to the concert if he really doesn't want to (even though I would be sad if he didn't come because it's Valentine's Day). I just want him to be happy because I love him.   Now for sooner times, I have a feeling that I need to spend more time with Chris. We usually have Monday nights and some time on Wednesdays. But I know that I haven't been putting as much effort into our friendship that I should. And in all honesty...I feel horrible about it. Chris and I have been friends since 7th grade. Yes we have had our ups and downs...but that is normal in teenage girl friendships. Yes, I have wanted to kill her at times and I know she has wanted to strangle me at some point or another...but I think that is what makes our friendship so unique and inspiring in ways. I'm sorry that I haven't put in full effort. I will make it up to you Chris.

      I got my prom dress altered today....well just pinned. But that means that it will be altered soon and I can bring it home! Woot! Ashley (yes ashley) went out there with me. That way she could see it. She said it is Beautiful. ^.^ Now my dress is long enough that it still brushes against the ground but I won't step on it when I walk. So it's all groovy.   After getting that done, Ash and I went to Sonic...in Manchester. Fun stuff....I guess. Well, it was fun when we went to Claires (back in T-town) and Dillards. I got a new skirt. It's uber cute. I wouldn't have gotten it but Ash said it was really cute so I did. And it was super cheap. Originally $34.00-Marked down to $8.50. GOOD DEAL EH?? Then I got a pair of OP pants there on Friday...originally $44.00- marked down to $11.00. Good stuff Man.  Well...I guess that's it for now. I don't really have much else to say...except I am UBER excited about prom!!!!!!

      We have finally decided on prom where-abouts. Well, everything except the whole after-prom scheme. I EVEN GOT MY DRESS!!!!!!!!! AND SHOES!!!!!!!!!!! it's Great! Anyway....before dinner I have to make an appearance at the Wright's house because Daddy Wright is expecting Paul and I to come for pictures. Then we will *hopefully* get picked up in the limo and go to The Butler's Pantry for dinner (we are getting a GREAT deal on that!). After that I suppose we will go to the dance out at UTSI. Nice little drive..but I don't mind as long as we have that limo. hehe. But even if we don't, it's all gravy. I don't know what we will do afterwards....hopefully Tori will ask her mom...but if not, oh well.

      Spring break has started...Whoop...'cept I've been working! At least I am getting paid for it. Paul got back from Gatlinburg today and called me. That was nice. His little brother wants me to come to their house on Friday for cake because it's his birthday. Paul said that the downside would be that his grandparents would be there. I dont know how that is a downside, but then again, I only met them for a few minutes. I will haveta think about that one.   As for the whole friendship being screwy thing. I'm putting it in the past and never thinking of it again. Its bringing up way too much mess and junk. I just haven't seen Ashley to be able to tell her that....*sigh* hopefully she'll read this and accept my lame apology.

      In...out...in...out.   A nice, calming rythm. I find myself to be doing things like that a lot lately. I've been so stressed. I feel like I'm neglecting my friends (those of them that still like to spend time with me that is). I feel as if no matter what I do, I'm failing my mother and my religion. I think I'm going to fail Chemistry...and no one will help me with it. It's all just too much for my poor pitiful brain to take in. Yes, Poor, Pitiful.   I wish I could jump ahead to the summer. That would be nice. I want to do a lot of things this summer. Mostly just spend time with my friends and Paul. Just hang out. I guess that's what I'm gonna be doing over spring break though. Laying around. Paul has school the first week and my friends will more than likely have other stuff to do. *sigh* this bites.     Okay, I have to get this off my chest. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN SOMEONE THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS DECENT TELLS YOU THAT YOU SHOULD GO KILL YOURSELF!?!?! How fucking rude right? I sure as hell thought so. Especially since I had JUST finished saying that I was having a HORRIBLE day!!!! "why don't you just go kill yourself"...grrr....Yeah, real mature there right?? I wish I could leave this place forever...or fast-forward life.

      A lot has happened this past week. Paul broke up with me, got accepted to SCMI, spent a lot of time with friends, read a book, took exams, caught up with an old friend, got back together with paul, got ready for SCMI, etc. I want to elaborate on 3 of those topics.   1) Caught up with an old friend. At one point in time he was more than a friend, but that was a long time ago. I figured that it was only natural to want to spend sometime with him considering our past. The time finally came when Paul and I split. He decided to take me to lunch and cheer me up. I was fine with that. But something seemed off. He insisted on picking me up at my house and buying my lunch...then took me to his house. Urgh, while we were there we decided to watch a movie. He kept trying to hold my hand and asking me to go swimming with him in his pool. I would have been fine with just a visit and friendly chat over a light lunch. I wasn't planning on being hit on. HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND!! And at the time I was heartbroken. Goodness people!   2) Yes, Paul and I broke up. He needed time/space to think. I regretfully had no choice but to give it to him. But that's in the past. Now we are back together. We had talked for a long time on Wednesday night. Then tonight I went over to his house. It was like we were never apart. And now, we're officially back together. I couldn't be happier. I love him with all my heart and I just hope that he knows it.  3) Thirdly and finally I want to express how much I will miss some of the seniors this year. Last night was graduation and throughout the whole ceremony I was thinking how I will miss so many of them. Some more than others. There's one senior in particular who I love joking around with. I have so many memories with him from so many different occasions. It's easy being around him and I will miss him dearly. Then there's others who I have always expected to see around. I can't imagine how hard it will be to leave next year myself if it is half as bad as seeing these folks off.  I think that is it for now. Tomorrow after I sing in choir at church Tori and I are leaving for Cookeville. Time for SCMI! A whole week in Cookeville with no mother, brother, or evil step-father to pester me. And I must say, I CAN'T WAIT!! Just kind of sucks that I have to leave the day after I get back together with Paul...go figure.

      Okay...first off...It's been a helluva long time since I posted last. And the only thing that I can really think of that has happened is when I contracted mono. Ah...Mononucleosis...can't wait to get rid of that.   Anyway...I just want to say that I NEVER called you a fucking bitch, Tori. I'm not that shallow for starters and it hurts to think that you thought I would go "that low." Secondly, I'm not waiting for you to apologize. I'm not apologizing either since the only thing that I said was, "Thanks..." and walked off. You try not having a choice in whether or not you are *allowed* to go to school everyday. I WANT TO GO!!! I would love to be able to get out of the house before 1:30 everyday just so I can go to band. But frankly, I'm not supposed to even be doing that. And the only reason that I was mad in the first place was because of the attitude that you used when you told me that I was "going to fail all your [meaning my] classes". That really boosts one's self-esteem. I was and am quite aware of the chances of me not passing. I am also aware of the fact that the STATE requires the school to give me incompletes for the semester until I have the opportunity to make it all up. I hope that you realize that I'm not mad at you and that yes, I still want you to go to California with me. But this is bullshit.

      So I haven't written in awhile, but I have good reason. Last week I was in Michigan. I have to say that it was definately a new experiance. The weather was great. Leaving Tennessee where the temp was around 97 with 100% humidity and going to Michigan where it's only 65...words can't describe how great it was. Okay, now I seem really dumb for talking aimlessly about the weather, but it's my favorite kind and well...I'm dumb I guess.  Anyway, I was there to see Molly. I can't believe that she has lived up there for over a year now. The memory of her leaving seems so recent and I still hate to dredge it up. So on with the good stuff. I got to Detroit on Tuesday (I flew Northwestern...seemed like the flight was abandoned it was so empty, and it was really short in comparison to the California trips that I am used to making.) Becky, Molly's sister, picked me up at the airport (oh, this airport, yeah...it kicks ass. It has a freakin'   train   in it!). Well, since I don't really feel like giving a day by day, I'll just say that I went shopping every day (ranging from garage sales, to Outlet Malls, to Old Navy, to Molly's drawers...lol). I came back with more stuff than I had ever expected to get while I was there. 2 purses, new underwear, a t-shirt, 3 pairs of jeans (all from Molly! How often do you get Banana Republic, Lucky Jeans, and Gap clothes from your friends??), a hat, a pair of flip flops, a keychain (courtesy of Molly's aunt), and earrings. I think that was it, but I'm not guarantee-ing it.  Sunday night Molly, Becky, Emily (Becky's 8-month old daughter...she's SOO silly! Such a ham. hehe), and I drove back into Tennesee. We left Ann Arbor around 8:30 and got into Nashville around 4:30. So we made really good time. Molly and I went to Smyrna on Monday where my parents picked us up. We had Toot's for dinner which was definately an experiance as it was just Molly, my mom, and myself. From there we went around Big Lots...but then there was the Firewroks a.k.a Fireworks stand. Good stuff. Okay, so you won't get all of this, but oh well.   Moral of this entry: it's been a long time since I have written and in the mean-time I had a really great time with a really great friend.

      I keep forgetting to write in this thing. And considering my last post, an update is in need. I apologize for to anyone who actually DOES read this and was confused by my last post. It was just a rambling that I needed to get out and I had no one to really talk to about it. Anyway...since the last real post, so much has happened. I got to go to Bonnaroo 2004 which was an experiance in itself. It was great because I got in for free, and I got to work which wasn't bad at all because it was soo much fun. The highlight of being there was I got to see my favorite band: Guster. Man, that was the best show ever. The energy was so high...and so were the people. haha.  Anyway...the only other thing that has really happened is babysitting. I HATE KIDS!! And I don't really have a choice in the matter. Yes, I am getting paid, but these kids are horrible! They never have anything good/nice to say, they don't behave, they don't do what they are told, and they are always talking back. I mean, how hateful can ya get guys?? It sucks even more that they are all related to me. Arrgh! It's okay though because it has made me realize that I never, EVER want to have children of my own. Paul backs me up 100% on that, so we don't have to worry about the whole kid thing. Woot.  On a final note...I want out of this house. Out of this city would be nice. And out of the state would be ideal. What I thought was going to be the best summer of my life is turning out to be pretty damn lame.

      Has that ever happened to you? That one moment (or several in some cases) where you thing about the exact same thing as someone else. It could be simple and you both said the same thing, or it can be deep and personal. I don't know how many times that's happened with me...The unimportant ones at least. It always happens; most people call it coincidence. But what about the other kind. Those times when you "happen" to be on the same page with someone. Especially if they are close to you. I can say that I can count those times on one hand. That those times mean the most to me. That one of those times happened in a conversation last night. How can someone know what is deep in my heart and bring up the same question? How can someone understand me so well and yet not at all? It's all so puzzling. What I need is time to think...but it's hard to think when you have underlying questions. I need that one underlying question answered, but only one person can do so. Will the result be jeopardy? Am I willing to give up myself if I don't ask the question? Is it time to take the next step in my life? Should I even be questioning such a thing? All these questions and so little answers. I need to find the one piece of the puzzle...that's all I ask. Answer one question, find the one piece, and the rest falls into place.

      Last night was amazing. Simple as that. And even though I won't go into detail, I need to say this. It's brought up questions. Questions inside me that I need answered...Hopefully they will be sooner rather than later. And hopefully, it will be amazing again.

      "What'd they do to you up thur?" That's definately the understatement of the year. Since last Saturday I was in Cookeville for Southeast Chamber Music Institute...so much happened! "Oh gawd" (as Russell would say) it was so much fun!! Apparently I am "married" to Jesse because we have a love-hate relationship. We even had a divorce while we were there (thanks to good ol' Vern) and got back together...stupid Jess-dash-e claiming he got the car...Anyway it was good stuff. Lindsey Jo was awesome. So was "I AM BETTY CROCKER BITCH" and "I CAN'T READ!"...let's not forget "COMPTON!! WHAT?!? COMPTON! WHAT?!?" and Russell's butt dance. Yeah, this stuff is going to take a lot of explainin'...and it sucks that I have picked up on the whole country accent thing...oh well...It was good stuff Man...Good Stuff.

      Today has been, in one word, horrible. And I really don't like that. So let's start from the beginning. I woke up with a phone call from a friend. No biggie there. I just wasn't really conscious of what I was saying, and that's not ever good. When I finally got my lazy butt out of bed I remembered that I had to get my pictures taken today. Now how can someone forget that? I don't know. So I did some wash. Oh, I should probably mention that I was babysitting. So, I'm doing wash, watching kids, and making sure they don't make a mess while they make lunch. Then I have to start getting ready to leave. The little heathens decided that since I was a little bit preoccupied that they could do whatever the heck they wanted. BIG MISTAKE ON THEIR PART. So now I'm doing wash, watching kids, making sure they don't make a mess (in general), trying to get ready for my 2:00 appointment for senior pictures in Manchester, and trying to control the mongrouls. By the time that I was FINALLY ready to leave I had to turn around and come back because I forgot my clarinet. Then I got caught at a train. Here comes the part that I am   so   happy about. My freakin car broke down again! By the time that I finally got to my grandparents house, my car had died twice. And I still had to go to Manchester! It died two more times before I even got out of Tullahoma. It dies when I go fast, it dies when I go (period), and it now dies when I slow down!! I have to say that the best part of my day was when I was getting the pictures taken (which took a whopping 2 and a half hours)...except the fact that my mom didn't come like she was supposed to. Then I came home. My car *only* died 2 times by the time that I got home. It's been a long day. My car won't get looked at until Thursday at the soonest, and band camp is on Friday. Oh poo...I just found out that I'm going to have *another* kid to watch tomorrow. I think I need a break.  God Bless.

      I get my senior portraits taken tomorrow. Formal and informal. It's kinda freaking me out because it means that I will really be out of the high school next year. Sudden realization sucks. Anyway, I got a really cute new outfit tonight for some of the pictures. I'm nervous and excited. More on that later...  God bless.

      So now I feel really bad about the whole "hating on mothers" thing. When my mom got home from work today she told be about how bad everything has been. She stopped taking her anti-depressants a month ago; they cost too much. She had a breakdown today. Called the doctor crying. Had to leave work to go to the doctor. She said that the only thing that has kept her alive this week (literally) is me. She said that she would have killed herself this week if she would have known that I had someone in life. She realizes that I don't. And I really mean   someone  . Jordan, my brother, has his father (that I can't stand), grandparents, and everyone here. The only person that I have, besides her, is Paul...and frankly, I couldn't go live with him if something happened. I would be sent away to California and that is the reason that she didn't do something drastic. She didn't want me to have to give up my life here. Now I am living in a land of guilt. How can I be so selfish? I vow to take into consideration the way others are feeling and what they may be going through. I ask for help in keeping this vow. So all I have left to say is...sorry.  God Bless.

      So at this point in time, I think I just need to type. There has been so much going on lately that all of my emotions are completely out of line.  So how about scenario #1:  We were supposed to leave for Gatlinburg this morning. Well, since Monday my mother hasn't been able to decide whether or not we are going. One day the answer was 'yes' and the next the answer was 'no'. There was a problem with this. On the second day there, we were supposed to go to the water park. Well, I don't own a bathing suit!!! For goodness' sake I know that that is odd (but in all honestly, mine from last year is too big). That was the only reason that I kept asking her if we were going. I needed to buy a bathing suit if we were! Oh!! And it didn't really help that everytime she was on the phone she was talking to the family that we were supposed to go with! She would sit there and tell Marsha over and over that we were going, then get off and tell me no. What the heck people?! And then last evening she got really mad at me because I had asked her again while she was on the phone with Marsha. Can you blame me? I would kind of like to know what is going on in my life. Arrrr...  Scenario #2: Last night I'm sitting on the couch reading a book and all of a sudden the phone rings. Nothing abnormal about that. The nature of the call, on the other hand, could have gone over a LOT smoother. You see, it was a babysitting call...for me. But I didn't get to talk to the lady on the phone. My mom just volunteered me for the job without even asking me in the first place. What if I had plans for today? Which I did. Well it obviously didn't matter because I had to babysit. And while we are on that topic, I'm going to elaborate. The kids that I have no choice but to watch today, I have watched before. I had no problem with watching them then. My sudden change of heart was due to the fact that their mother never came to pay me. So she has owed me $50 for over a month now. Why should I do her a favor and watch her kids if she still hasn't paid me for the last time? I just don't understand that.  Scenario #3: I have to say that this one is very different from the others. This one makes me sad. Things are great with Paul. Getting better with every day that I see him actually. On Wednesday night I went to his house after my senior portrait meeting. That was so much fun. The power went out and we went to "investigate". We sat on his bed and talked for a really long time about nothing in particular. It was really nice. Then yesterday I went over to his house again. We watched a movie and played with his little brother. Once again, it was nice. The whole leaving thing got me down though. And I know how pathetic that is. But he's leaving for vacation sometime today, and I'm going to miss him. I don't even know if I'm going to talk to him while he's gone...and he's going to be gone until the 19th. Then I have band camp. So in all honesty, I don't know when the next time I will see him will be.   Scenario #4: I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BAND CAMP THIS YEAR!! Not only am I a senior now, but our show is going to be really awesome! Okay, so our theme is pirates (Arrr matey..hehe) and we are doing songs from Pirates of the Caribbean, Song of the Sea Maidens, and something from DCI (Drum Corps International). I can not wait!   And now that I have said everything that I can think of at the moment, I am going to end this post. Sorry if you actually read this...I know that it's almost pointless. I just had to say some of this stuff before I burst. I feel much better now!   God Bless!

      Just in case anyone wants to know...my mother really pisses me off. I don't really care to go into detail because I don't want her to find this and get all pissy with me. But the fact is she is infuriating. Yesterday she was trying to be all buddy buddy (because of something that happened earlier in the day that I don't think she realizes I know ALL about). Today she is being completely stand-offish. Not only that but when I try to   talk   to her she closes up and the only thing she says is "mmhmm" and "oh". Great conversation eh? And the last weekened that I was here she was being super nice. "Mother-daugher this" and "Mother-daughter that". Why can't she be NORMAL sometimes?? And it really bites because I always hear "your mom is so cool" and "your mom kicks ass" and all that junk because she   isn't   a conventional mother. But every once and awhile it might be nice to know that she is a tad bit more mature than I am.
