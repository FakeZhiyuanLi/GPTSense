      So, I got up at 9:20 AM, had some toasted bread with butter and honey. It was tasty, but not particularly filling. I talked to my sister a bit, saw one of her friends, and did other stuff.  The other stuff I can't really remember, but I probably checked Utopia. And I also probably checked the usual route of comics and forums and other sites.  The daily routine, in essense. I did, however, do some things of note today, which I will note like a good little boy. I drew a little logo for Sparty's "F2 Wants YOU!" promotional poster. It's a little hand clenching together, on fire. I drew it in Photoshop CS, which, by all rights, I actually shouldn't have, but I do. It looks pretty good for something done with the pen tool, which is fine by me.  Anyways, today I read Death of a Salesman (the play by Arthur Miller, for the uninformed). I thought it was pretty good, but any real enjoyment I might've gleaned from reading it was wiped from existence since it's for school. A shame, really. I also took a nap from 12ish to 3ish. It was revitalizing and refreshing, but it made me hungry. So I grabbed some chips and some apple juice and finished up Death of a Salesman.  That was an unfortunate move on my part, as it sort of crossed out eating dinner, something I will attempt to do after I post this. I wrote up a bit of history for my web-comic, planned some things out, drew another outline of a character, this time with clothes on.  Did I cover everything? No, no. I also wrote a quick essay comparing (actually just summarizing, really) No Exit and Death of a Salesman. I hate writing comparative things. They suck, because I'm bad at them and just end up explaining each story thoroughly, with some minor points of how they relate to each other.  I didn't totally finish the essay; I'll be revising that one and my other comparative one soon. By and large, I prefered the essay on Thoreau the most, since it really allowed me to explain and argue effectively. I have Andrew to thank for that one, I guess.  That's about the order of the day. I can't think of anything else of interest or use to record, besides the fact that I got a present from my step-mother. It's a little Simpsons bottle opener that plays a quote of Homer when you open anything with it. It's cute and amusing.    Mmm, beer. Woo-hoo!

      I got up at around 8:20, which is ridiculously early for me. I probably browsed  urlLink Slashdot ,  urlLink Flecko , and  F2  [EDIT: Link removed for privacy's sake]. Oh, and my comics(Penny Arcade, PVP, 8-Bit Theatre, Sluggy, Ctrl-Alt-Del). I most likely did that for an hour or so before getting breakfast and checking Utopia(an incredibly geekish game that embarrasses me just to mention).  I can't remember when, but at some point I must've had the ludicrous idea of starting a blog. In general, these appeal to me because of their technological sophistication and ease-of-use; I've tried livejournal and browsed through xanga, but I must say that I was most impressed with Blogger. The styles, the XHTML customization, the timestamp settings; classy and usable.  So I set up my blog and decided the purpose of it: to log the day's events in the case of my memory failing me(which does happen - quite often, in fact). So, the point of this, as mentioned before, is to record my history. I plan to update it at most once a day, as I've stated, all through-out grade 11.  That said, I played some Starscape, Slide Swords, and Crimsonland throughout the day. None of them amused me for long, but Crimsonland was by far the most enjoyable, even after all this time. Since it is rather late now you'll noticed my chronological sense is rather skewed; like events are grouped together.  I took the dog for a short walk at around 1:30, and then went to buy two Cokes from the local Blockbuster, since they have a deal and all. I took the bike we keep near the backdoor that our Japanese exchange student uses to get to school. When I got back I made some sammiches. Or sandwiches. Both are acceptable in my vernacular, although the former is more amusing to say. They were tasty, in any case.  So that passed some time. I got a call from Sarah(from England, who was at CCW and Sun Camp with me) and she told me that Julia, Elizabeth, and herself were trying to find out about the after-party for CCW. I knew relatively nothing and was little help. However, they called a bit later to inform me that I was invited to a party over at Julia's house, going from 7 to 11. I was cool with that, and agreed to join them at the specified time.  In the meanwhile I set about working on the basic designs for my web-comic. I didn't really accomplish much, but I did have fun designing some characters(rather badly, I'll admit). Hopefully I'll have more time to work on it after I finish my work for English 10. My art really needs sharpening, after all.  I had a quick pasta dinner before setting off to the party; a fair amount of CCW were there, plus Regan(pronounced ree-gan; she's a she). We had Will, Pete, James, Ben, Trevor, Elizabeth, Julia, Sarah, Max, Adam, Lucien, and I. I didn't expect much out of this party really, since it was at Julia's house and her mom is rather conservative. In short: no drugs or booze. Which was fine, anyways; I didn't really feel like getting wasted.  We played spin the bottle, Twister, truth or dare, whatever. The dares were rather amusing, actually; lap dances and othersuch nonsense was administered in a quite liberal manner. My favourite part of the party, however, was constantly hitting on Elizabeth - she's my ex from when I was twelve or so, and she got  hot . I would've hit on her more during CCW/Sun Camp, but she's currently infatuated(quite adorably, really) with an RoW of the same name as I. He'll be gone soon enough, though, and I figure I might have a chance. She's really beautiful, and easy to hang out with. She's always laughing or smiling, something that I find immensely appealing.  Anyways, that about covers it for the night. I might edit in some things that I forgot tomorrow, but I think that that is unlikely. Anyways, the rest of the day will go as follows: brush teeth, perhaps look at some sites, do a couple of sit-ups and push-ups, read a bit, sleep.  That is a ridiculous amount for me to write, but I suppose it was a rather eventful day. And I  am  being more open and explanatory than I usually am. Looks like those writing skills will be easier to improve than I thought?

      Since the whole point of this blog will be to record what happens during the day at the  end  of the day, this will be rather out of sorts.  However, I do need to set ground rules for my blogging format, so I might as well set them here.       One post per day. At the end of the day, summarizing what happened during the day.     Progressively wittier and more intelligent writing. This might as well have more than one use, right?     A clear view of what I promised I would do and didn't do, so that I can plan and focus more effectively.
