      I'm in a quandry that faces most budding writers. Too many story ideas, too little discipline to focus on one. Every single writing manual I've read from Stephen King's brilliant 'On Writing', David Morrell's (Rambo) ' Lessons from a lifetime on writing' offer the same advice: write about something that really interests you.   I get where they're coming from; my first Creative Writing professor was absolutely riveted by the idea of Indians writing (he acted like I was the first; Rushdie, Roy and Naipaul are obvioulsy chopped liver :) ) so I, being the people-pleaser I am, pandered to him in the worst way, writing the same type of stereotypical garbage I mock most of the time.   Now that I've decided to write my fiction, I'm faced with a different problem: I have two workable ideas, both of which interest me, one based on persona experiences, the other one that affected my State's political history in a big way (and, more important to me, my family's political persuasion). The problem is that I'm leaning toward the second idea since its remoteness makes it easier to focus one(without the debilitating emotional baggage of the first one); however, the first one is way more marketable.      Both stories are 'authentic' where I'm concerned, making my decision all the harder. I'm going to start off by working on parallel plot outlines; maybe that'll help me make up my mind.

      I know this seems rather late to be commenting on the whole ordeal, but I find it strange that the Saudi police (who, from personal experience, I rate as being only slightly more competent that the clerks at 7-11s) managed to find the kidnappers so quickly after the killing, supposedly based on info. of a witness who watched the body being dumped, but they have no clue where the body is even now.   Secondly, I read that Johnson was married in Saudi Arabia. I wasn't aware that Christian weddings were allowed in the country. Hmm...live in a country for sixteen years and you still have no idea about it. I know a few Christian friends who held covert Sunday services, but then again they were Indian like me, and the only skin the Saudis will kowtow to is White.   Speaking of which, in all the hubbub about the seventeen people killed in Khobar, few paid attention to the fact that most of the dead were non-Westerners, Indians in fact.

      I'm not a hard-working person by nature, and my (dubious) work ethic has suffered ever more since I discovered Harry Potter fan fiction. My addiction has gotten to the point that I spent hours trawling for stories, googling character names and pairings, and even rereading whole stories while waiting for updates.   I call this an addiction because  1.  I no longer hanker for a life; I'm more than happy living           vicariously through fictional characters.   2.  I 'ship' with the sort of manic intensity and obsesiveness         usually reserved for proselytizing and terrorism.  My problem is that I spend so much time reading and worrying about FF that could better be used on my own work. Also, the stories are of uneven quality: the ones on SugarQuill are brilliant, but most on ff.net suck worse than my high school essays--though the ideas behind them are good, the use of language is atrocious. The worst part is that by spending so much time reading those stories rather than 'real' fiction, I've managed to pick up more than a few 'ugly English' skills that my creative writing instructor is more than happy to tear into. Every step I take forward in class , I take half a step back on my own.   Great writers learn their craft by studying the Masters; I learn mine from fan girls obsessed with Draco Malfoy. *sigh*

      As a liberal arts major, I live up to all the stereotypes, especially the one about being a lover of theory than practicality. I've KNOWN what blogs are, browsed through a few hundred, wanted to start my own, But...The thought of actually initiating action of any kind is anathema.   Anyhoo, this is the beginning of an exciting period in my life, and I thought I'd chart it online, so I can look back on it fondly (if i succeed) and bitterly (if I fail).   I've been a writer wannabe for a long time, and have written a few short stories (I never realized what the true difficulty of my chosen career path until I tried to write a coherent, well-paced short story within a specific time period, working a certain amount of time each day--rather than wait for 'Inspiration' as was my practise). Now, I'm finally satisfied that I can turn out a story that people won't use to line their trash-cans, I'm about to start work on my first novel.  I've got an idea, an image. The planning, drawing the outline etc. begins NOW... :)
