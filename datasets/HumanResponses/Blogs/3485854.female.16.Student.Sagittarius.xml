        Hey all!!! I'm bored as hell and my hands still smell like bleach from scouring the fuck out of my house today!!!  Hey....incoming message!!!      Attenion to All!!!     We have been informed that the Arabs do not like to be called "towel heads." The item they wear on their heads is actually a small sheet. Effective immediately, please call them "little sheet heads." Thank you for your cooperation.      So what's new in the world? Life's a bitch and then you die.(or in a guy's case, then you marry one.) Leah called me...Emily called me.... Yay! I feel loved, but still haven't heard from Danny. Every time we have a break or something he doesn't try to get a hold of me and then tells me it's because of his grandparents or something later. But when I call him, I can usually always get a hold of him. Go figure. Okay, I'll quit bitchin' about this subject and move to a new one.        Thanx K.E. I'll be sure to visit your site. Emily was telling me you had started a site. Guess what, I rememberd my name this time!! lol. Thank you guys for your comments, I like having some contact with the outer world other than people I pay bills to and people at the shithole I work in.  You know, If you guys ever have anything you want to ask about, start any type of discussions or debates about, just say something in the comments you guys leave. I love the feedback. I've thought about a few topics, but I think I'll wait for someone to throw some interesting material I can work with.         Joke for today:     What did one lesbo frog say to the other?  Wow, we really do taste like chicken!!!

          Okay,   I just got off work, and let me tell you..it was a bitch, but I'm not going to bitch about it right now, My mom listened to me and now I'm tired of talking about it. Anyway...now, I decided to include some of the similar info....OMG...is that Tabitha...somewhat following the crowd for once? lol. N E way..I'm dating this dude named Danny. This isn't the first time we've dated, but it is the longest. I'm dating him because he can make me laugh, he usually makes me feel special, and when I had no desire to be with one person, he worked so hard to bring me around. I could just Lay there in his embrace for an eternity, I love to be held. And he finds little things that are special. He writes songs for me and about me and isn't materialistic. We've had our little tid-fits, but have gotten through them and I think that they have brought us closer together.    Leah:    is a friend that has stuck close by my side, as I have tried to stick by hers. I hope she considers me a good of friend as I consider I consider her. We are supposed to get an apartment together when we're 18.     Scott:    is a new edition to our "clan." We're corrupting him incredibly so. What can I say, anyone who hangs out with us are in jeopardy of having their mind altered to think outside the box. I have other friends that may be mentioned later, but...that's for another time.    Joke for Today    There was a young white couple who had just recently gotten married and had waited to have sex untilt they were married. Well, the wife told her husband at their hotel that she didn't want to get pregnant yet. So she told him to go buy a condom at a little store not within short walking distance While she anxiously waited with all of the lights off.  When He finally arrived at the store he realized that he only had 20 cents on him. the cashier was showing him condoms. He said the white one was 15 cents, a black one which was better in quality was 20 cents, and the best one was purple but it was 25 cents. well, he took the black one.  While the husband was gone a black thief got into the hotel. Excitedly, the new wife thought it was her husband and grabbed hold of him and started screwing him quite wildly. She had worn herslef out and turned over and went to sleep.  Her husband soon came home and jumped on her, mounting her, and vigorously started to make love to her. The wife was surprised as she was worn out and thoroughly pleased. A nine months later, they had a black baby boy. When they boy got older the boy asked his father why he was black while his father was white. The father replied, "you better feel damn lucky! 5 cents more and you would have been purple!!!!" Well, I may write more tonight or tomorrow, for now I have to go put my bed together and do some cleaning then plan for my trip to Elkart, Indiana. I'm driving up and mom's driving back. 7 and a half both ways...15hrs total!!! I'll visit your sites before I get off though.  By the way, who in the hell is Holy Kitsune or whatever it was? just so that if I reply I know who I'm talking to.     Today's Quote    He who stands on toilet is high on pot!

        Hello and welcome to all who have come to visit my site. This post is to let everyone who chooses to read this know what to expect from me. You are to expect no particular pattern, you are to expect the most random, off-the-wall B.S. that I feel I wish to write that day, you are not to expect me to post every day, and you are to expect postings displaying whatever mood I happen to be in that day. Somedays I may bitch and complain, which you are welcome to do in comment boxes, Somedays I may ask for advice or opinions which I hope will be answered in comment boxes, or by e-mailing me at Blades2442@yahoo.com (but please put blog reply or something in the subject), or I may give advice that is asked through e-mail or comment boxes. if you wish to remain annonymous or only reply through e0mail, I will respect your wishes and do only as such. I may tell jokes, say what's up and ask everyone how they are, or write what is on my mind whether it be through poetry, usual script, or whatever feels right. In my next post I will give a small intro to who I am, about my friends, and maybe more. For now I depart and wish you all goodnights. Goodnight, T.Y.

        I see a face within the shadows, a face that beckons me forth. I see face of familiar tranquility, a face locked away within my memory.  But why?  Why does it seem that i see this face in vain? Why do such good memories cause so much pain? Why can't one just forget the past. Why can't my heart truly let go at last?  All I ask is to feel the love. All I ask is to feel the strength. Yet, all I can think is why?  Why does it have to be so hard? Why did it have to happen to him? Why can't this face just leave my thoughts? Why must it call with such force? Why can't I let it all end?  I hope this face will lie in rest. I hope my dreams might go unpossessed. I hope solutions to these torturing riddles will come before another death.   Maybe that is the solution. But there is much I can't leave behind. There will will a time for the glimmer of objects, as they shimmer in my eye.  For now I must hold back this river of tears, as the face beckons me to come ever so nearer. A river I feel I will drown in before it is time.       Now, I know this doesn't follow any particular patter, nor is it very good i think, but it was one i was writting on the spot. It was just a glimpse of what is going through my head right now. Sorry if this one is such a drag guys. Maybe I shouldn't post on holidays anymore, nor about them. It doesn't do any good to bring others down too. I guess it's just a reach out for some type of companionship in a time like this. But i can't type anymore. I can't start crying any more than I already have, it won't do me any good. Goodnight.

      I'm trying, I really am, to stay happy and positive, but for some reason, I don't think my mom is convinced. She keeps rubbing my head or something and telling it'll be okay. I really don't want to bring her down. I guess it's a good thing I have to work tomorrow so that I don't have to think about my father's death until i get ome. Maybe I can avoid it all together. It took every bit of will power i had not to cry when picking out cards for my grandpa and my mom's boyfriend. I go through this every year and I hate, I hate it so much. But I suppose I'll get through, just as I do every year, every birthday, and every holiday. I was glad to pick out a card for him though, because he has done so much for us already. We're moving into a new house thanks to him, and he's made mom so happy. I guess I can't compain. I just wish holidays and stuff were easier. Anyone else who can sympathize through the death of a father or anyone else close like that for that for that matter, comment or e-mail me, maybe we can help eachother through tomorrow. Well, I went out with Danny after he got back. Come to find out he did try to call me, but mom apologized because she made me pissed of at him because she forgot to tell me. It's all better i guess. I guess we'll see how it goes over the summer.  Speaking of summer, I promised the familyi would take them to Holday World, not the chech I get the 29th but the one I get one the 13th. If I take any pics I might post them, along with one of me, finally. If there is anyone who think they might be scared away and say I shouldn't....TOOOO BAD!!!!...lol.  Well, since i've neglected my blog for a while now, I'll give you guys a longer joke to read...enjoy. ~Joke for Today~  Ouch  Joe, a successful man by most standards, began to be bothered by some incredible headaches.   When both his professional life and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who claimed he could solve the problem.   "The good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to  remove the testicles," said the doctor.   Joe was shocked and depressed, but decided he had no choice but to accept the operation.   He left the hospital wearing a diaper under his clothing, but his mind was clear and no headache.   As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He decided then and there that he could make a new beginning and live a more fulfilling life.   As he walked past a men's clothing store, he thought,"That's what I need, a new suit." Joe entered the shop and told the salesman: "I'd like to see some of your suits."   The salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see . . . size 44 long."   Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job," replied the salesman. Joe tried on the suit and it fit perfectly.   As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"   Joe thought for a moment and said, "Sure . . "   The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see . . . .34 sleeve and 17 neck."  Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"   It's my job," said the salesman. Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.   As Joe looked in the mirror and adjusted the collar, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?"   Joe was on a roll, so he said, "Sure . . . "   The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, "Let's see. . 9 Wide."   Joe was astonished, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job," said the salesman. Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked, "How about some new underwear?"   Joe thought for a second, and said, "Sure . . . "   The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, "Let's see ... size 36." Joe laughed and said, "No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."   The salesman shook his head and said, "You shouldn't wear a size 34. Eventually it will press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."

      Well, haven't heard from Danny, but Piercfield asked me out when I was at Lyndy's. I t was quite funny. I think were I to tell Danny, he might come around.  Tomorrow, I'm going to Holiday World. It's a trip for the managers at work. I hope to have fun. Mom and Brian are already talking about him moving in. She just met him for the first time on the 3rd, which is is exactly a week ago. Is that not some shit? Well, he better find some source of income, because I am not supporting another person, I'm struggling to provide for the 5 of us. I can't afford a sixth person.  Throughout my life I have come to feel this: 1.) I will depend on a man to support me 2.) I will never let the man I am with to sit while I support him, he will be expected to have some type of income 3.) I will never depend on my children to support me. If I can't provide for them I will not have them. Any disagreements?  Well, all, I'm going to go play pool. Later!  Joke of the day: Anyone coming?  The Lone Ranger and Tonto were riding on the range one day.   The two came to a stop, where Tonto jumped off his horse and put his head on the ground to listen to see if anyone was coming.   After a few seconds he rose and said, "Buffalo come."  The Lone Ranger was amazed and proclaimed "Damn you Indians are smart, how the hell did you know there were buffaloes coming?"  Tonto replied, "Face sticky."

        Well, just got off work, Danny still hasn't called ad I'm really cloe to saying forget it. When we're at school it's like he can't get enough of me, but when we don't see eachother every day, like I've said before, it's like I've fallen off the face of the earth. I'm no the type of person who likes sitting by the phone in my spare time. And he leaves for a week tomorrow. I f he doesn't want to lose me and he truly loves me like e claims, I think he should actually show it. Any takers? Besides, Damien is trying to holler at me and if Danny don't straighten up, I just might let him. Enough is enough, am I right? If Danny wants to stop it, he better let me know, otherwise, he's showing me that he doesn't want me anymore. Do you know how great it is to drive 90mi. an dhour on an interstate highway for several hours? Could have been batter, but I enjoyed the majority of it. If anyone wants any details, like how we ended up at Brian's house while he was still on the highway looking for us...and so on,  my e-mail is in my profile. I need to get drunk, maybe when I get paid I can talk my mo into getting something for me, I don't know, it's a no go on buying drinks for parties that aren't at home though, so she says.  This is just for you Leah and Kyle... How do you know she's a witch? (If you love you'll fill in the rest in the comments...lol    Joke for today    Three business men are driving through a storm when their car breaks down. They find a farm where the owner says they can stay in the barn with his daughter as long as they don't touch her. Well, of course they do and the farmer/father finds out in the morning. So he goes to the first man and asks him what his father does for a living. The man says, well, my father is a butcher, so the farmer gets out a butcher knife and cuts off his dick. He then goes to the secon amn and asks him what his father does for a living. He tells him he's a lumberjack, so the farmer takes a saw and cuts his off. When he gets to the thired man and asks him the same question. The man says, well, my father is a candy tester, he licks lollipops all day, so you'll have to lick mine off....lol.  Okay, I have to be at work early in the morning, so goodnight all Love, T.Y. Next blog may be a poem, maybe not, later!

        Just got off work. Tomorrow's going to be one long ass drive!!! N E wayz...Why do I always have to be the one to get a hold of him? Maybe I shoulod just say fuck him. Like I said, I told him before that this was our last time trying. He always makes me feel special until we don't see eachother every day at school, then it's like I've fallen off the face of the earth! I'm telling all kinds of other guys no just for him and now he treats me like this. Maybe if I tell him that I'm thinking about going astray he'll think twice. And Scott, I"ve tried what you suggessted before, letting him sweat it by waiting for him to call me instead, but last time I tried that he didn't call me all Spring Break! Or maybe, since he has the address to this site, he'll read what I'm saying and think about it and respond. Afterall, the last time he checked this was after my escond post, so... yeah. Maybe I'll go into the attitude I was in before, when I didn't want to date, just have random dates and a few fuck buddies.lol. I mean, my ex Tyler is still after me, a new guy at work, customers are always ashing for my number and other people I meet from friends or just in random places. But, I don't know. Kyle, would you do the honors of kicking him in the head like you suggested, knock some sense in to him?  EVIL SPASTIC CHEESY MONKEYS ARE PLOTTING MY DEMISE AND STEALING MY LEFT SOCK!    And thanx to Kyle and the Great George Carlin, I hve a new one. "Hurry, Hurry, get on the plane. Get on the Plane!  "Fuck you, I'm getting in the plane!"  Oh, Kyle, can you send an e-mail to Travis, giving him my e-mail telling him to e-mail me cuz I want to talk to him? I'd appreciate it.   Joke for Today  Breaking News...Just in! Reports from CNN journalists in Pakistan say that the Taliban have just made new demands. They demand that U.S. forces are removed or they will cut off the U.S. supply of convenience store Managers.
