      Last night, my friend Brian come into NYC and crashed at my messy apartment while he was working on an article. We went bar-hopping with these random NYC strangers (it's a long, long, long story) who ended up being nice. Anyway, so now I am wrapping up my damn article on, "Anti-Aging Creme." I am so not in the mood to type today. I never get ebough sleep. Am I boring on today's blog or what?

      Last night, Dor and I went to Lot61 around 10:30. I met these random, hot, tall, sexy Heebs and made out with them all night. Just kidding. That would we funny, but that did not actually happen.  I did feel a little weird. I don't DO well at single events. But I LOOKED okay, for once. Dor looked adorable--she wore this orange dress over a pair of jeans, sort of how Jackie dresses. I was wearing just a black tank and jeans and I put this shiny lotion on my arms. Dor and I joked about how 'Long Island' we are.  I had the most fun, actually, hanging with Dor and her friend Michele. This was my first event/"thing" for "Let My People Go." It was basically a roomful of Jewish singles mingling and NOT dancing. I joked that since we were all Jewish, no one was going to dance. But actually, Dor, Michele and I love to dance...just not in this enviornment.  We did make small talk with some guys, but none of us really met anyone, and I at some point, Dor and I got tired, so we left. But I am glad that I went. I need to get out more. I am a total girly-girl--there's no way I could ever, EVER, ditch my friends for a guy because I love girlfriends too much.  Anyway, Gina was in NYC last night, and we drove back to DH together, yakking the entire time about life, work, religion, art, etc. Gina and I had a marathon talk session in the way only we could. I'll be back in Manhattan tonight--and that's that.

      I swear, I'd give my left testicle (if I had one) to be a juror at Scott Peterson's trial. I am obssessed with the Scott Peterson case. OBSESSED!!!  It is so freaking obvious he's guilty--but I fear that he'll walk. Here's why: There is just not enough evidence to convict the prick of murder.  Amber Frey took the stand today. She's Scott mistress, and from what I can tell, a mega-slut and an idiot. Okay, YES I feel sort of bad she fell for a man who lied to her from the get-go. But she boffed him on the first date without knowing anything about him except that he liked strawberries, AND on the third date, she asked him to pick-up her two-year-old kid from daycare. Not 'pick-up' as in walk-into the building and get her daughter, but DRIVE HER BABY around.  Okay, idiot!!!!!!! Do you let a guy you met twice pick up your baby from daycare and drive around with her? Moron! Moron! Moron! This is her baby from an old boyfriend, BTW...Amber gets around...she's got a new man now and was preggers with his baby, too.  Okay, and Scott Peterson is so guilty--with his damn-ass smirk and constant reminders to Laci that he didn't want kids. Ohhhh and here is, in my opinion, the biggest clue he's guilty. Listen to this....  When Laci was building a nursery for Connor, she bought everything herself and decorated the bedroom by herself.  Scott Peterson told police, despite their insistance he didn't want kids, he was SO EXCITED to be a dad, he built his kid a table.  A table???????????????????  A TABLE??????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, newsflash. I am the oldest of four children. Babies need: a bassinette, a crib, a rocking chair, and tons of diapers. A newborn nany does not need a goddamn TABLE. For what???? He can't sit at it and do homework with an umbilicle cord still attached.  That statement, two years ago, from Scott Peterson, confirmed to me that he's guilty as hell. I still think about the table statement.  He built that table to pretend he gave a shit about his wife and kid. I'm sorry, you don't give a baby a table. To me, that is fishy....like his fishing story.  Scott Peterson is guilty and we all know it. But he's gonna walk. It's going to be an O.J. case.  Pathetic.

      I was just in Kinko's updating my magazine portfolio and I notice the man at the computer next to me looks familiar. Whatever, I think, and go back to work. He looked a little bit like, 'The Bachelor 1' Alex Michel (The one who passes on Trista Rehn for Amanda with the big boobs), but why the hell would "The Bachelor" be at a Times Square Kinko's???? And he was wearing just a T-shirt and jeans.  Then I hear him on a cell phone call someone and say, 'Hi Pat, it's Alex Michel returning your call" and he tells "Pat" that he's in NYC and is flying out of JFK to LAX tomorrow. Blah Blah Blah. No one else recognizes him at all; this is NYC, we could give a shit if a celeb is nearby. At this point, I have to pee, so I turn to 'Alex the Bachelor' and say, "Excuse me?" He looks at me like he expects me to ask, "Are you 'The Bachelor?" Instead, I ask, "Can you please watch my computer for a minute while I run to the bathroom?" He gives me a funny look, then says, "Okay." I run to the bathroom, come back and thank "Alex." He says, "Sure," and looks at me for another second when I pop a piece of gum in my mouth and return to work. He was still checking his hotmail.com when I left Kinko's. I should have asked, "What happened with you and Amanda?" But in 'reality' I don't give a hoot.

      Oh, yeah, one more thing...I met this girl once at a media event (Leave it to me to meet a GIRL at a media event) who added me as a "Friendster" a few weeks ago. I read her profile and she works at this awesome magazine. Shit! I want to email her and ask her if her mag was hiring...but I hardly know this girl and I met her months ago.   What would I say? "Hi, R, you and I met like 8 months ago at some freelancer union party...can you hire me? We *are* Friendsters!" I hate making people feel uncomfortable. I hate when people do that to me.  As for Emersonians, god bless my Alma Mater, for Emersonians are the most supportive in my job plight. Maybe I SHOULD move back to Boston. Seriously, god bless Emerson, the best little college in the world. We may have shared a campus with smarty-pants BU and MIT, but the alumni sure as hell support each other through everything, especially on the job hunt.   Who am I kidding? I can't go back to Boston. I can't tolerate those accents.  Help; I want to stay in Manhattan!!!

      Oh, so, last night at our media event, I broke the news to the partygoers that I resigned from my job. I felt kind of bad when a few of our party 'regulars' looked surprised and said they would miss me. It was flattering and bittersweet. One guy even gave me a hug and said he's not coming back to a party unless I'm there. I had no idea I made such an impact on these virtual strangers who only knew me via email and as the girl who signed them in and wore a boa to the parties! It made me feel good.  I got attached to some of the party 'regulars.' I'm sad to leave the freelancers and editors! Maybe if I was paid more and received benefits from the company, I would stick around. But I felt more like the office 'bitch' and was really itching to move on...  Now, I'm unemployed. The worst part is, since I was a 'contract' employee, I don't collect unemployment or anything. That's really not fair. Why can't you collect unemployment if you quit?  When mb offered me a job in March, I was also in the running for an associate editor position at John Leguizamo's magazine, 'iCaramba.' iCaramba was a start-up magazine for Latino college students and they really liked my resume, my knowledge of Latin culture and my background. But I panicked because iCaramba was a start-up magazine....so I took the mb job instead--and they promised me benefits and fulltime status. And that never happened. And guess what...iCaramba is selling really well in Latin America and I got royally f*cked at my job!!!!! I could kick myself for not taking the iCaramba job back in March.  Thank god I freelance and can make a little extra money doing that. But--hiiiiiiiiiii, I need a job now. This is not good. I have rent to pay!!  I have never been fired from a job. Even in high school and college, I would leave a job because I had to A) Go back to school or B) Because I was moving. I always waited until I reached my boiling point, and then quit. I hate doing that. But I can't take a job that's 'sketchy' or detrimental to my self-esteem.  I emailed iCaramba and asked if they still had my resume, and they said, yes, they totally remember me and will let me know if anything opens up...but still...my gut told me in March to TAKE that iCaramba job, but instead my nervous system took over and I took the dot.com gig instead.  I just never learn. Now I'm back on the job hunt and I'm flipping out because my lease is up in four weeks. Four weeks?! What am I going to do?! Help!

      It poured this entire weekend because of Florida's Hurricane Charley. This has been the wettest, most depressing, most lame-ass summer. I hardly got any swimming in. I didn't go to Amagansett or Boston. And it's been so humid, I feel like my makeup is melting into my pores. *sigh* And the summer Olympics are so boring they are NOT making up for my summer.  Anyway....I am so glad I only have three days left of work. But not glad that I have no idea what I am doing with my life; at all.  I am so pre-menstral today I have been eating everything in sight. I hate PMS.  Since only--what, two people?--are reading my blog, I can 'fess up that I have a tiny crush on this guy at my old job...the job I USED to have, and now only work at a few hours a month to make quick extra money. It's more of a 'work-crush' situation. In my sick, twisted little head, if we ever get together, I'll delete this post, heh...but in the interim, I'll let myself have a crush. I deserve one. I can't tell what he thinks of me, but we make eye contact a lot, and I think that's important. But who knows?  Anyway; I am so exhausted. This non-stop rain can make anyone so moody and tired. I'll post more again soon. I didn't get any freelancing done this weekend, BTW....
