      "Go to America. It's filled with opportunity and knowledge" "Go to Canada. It's fewer crime rate" "Go to China. It's better than America"  Going to a place where a person feels that he belongs, that is an exciting feeling fill with wonder and optimism. But... For many, the result is a great disappointment. I think I know the reason why...  It's the same everywhere.  People despise their home for many reasons: Hating a job, losing a job, being robbed, threatened... No matter where you are, you are bound to find misery somewhere. People out there suffer as much, maybe more, than those who probably live in what other would call bliss right now (Yet still don't realize that). I see the damages happen in Taiwan, in China, in America, even in Japan. Prosperous country, yes; good country, I don't know.  People can never find a place they belong unless they can, at least, understand this... The effort one put through to survive the pain one endures in life is inevitable. However, through that, happiness can be found.  I don't know whether you understand it or not. But even if I explain it in a simpler words, the knowledge will still be mine, not yours. Therefore, I'll leave it at that. It's up to you to think what I'm trying to say.

      I just got this...news... paper from Enki! It's so convenient for people there to know just about everything there is to know about their worlds without traveling.  It would seem that according to an article, Bush and Kerry are visiting children and being very nice to them. I don't understand. Kindness is an essential characteristic of humans, so why do the people publish an event as common as this? Is it really special for leaders there to be nice because the ones before are mean?  Then again, it clicked. They can very well be a perfect example of the kind of person Sekishi once was- someone who is being nice just to please people. If that is a fact, then I feel sorrow for the two men, along with the thousands who are depending their lives on one of the two. People who are just being people- pleasers usually are capable of doing despicable things behind others' backs. People like that don't really have what it takes to be a leader.   Enki says that people there vote for their leader. It's good that the majority has a voice in the country, but what if they are being tricked by the candidates? In our world, Kirins pick the leaders of the countries. It seems biased, yes, but we Kirins have the ability to sense aura of true potentials and see through the kind of people our leaders are. Even if they turn out to be corrupted, Heaven can immediately punish the leaders. I wish people there have powers like ours...

      Teenage years... those are what the elders call the golden years.  It's true because they are referring to the fact learn more than we ever will. After that, our minds are just sort of fixed. It's also at this point in life where we are developing into the kind of person we want to be in the future.  Of course, over 50% of the teens want to be good person. Therefore, they decide to be nice to people. However, I found that there is a fine line of difference between being good and being nice. A nice person... They would try their best to make others feel happy. However, it doesn't matter who you are; there is no way you can please everyone in the world. The only exception is if you are not yourself, becoming a hypocrite. I guess... being nice is just a small portion of being a good person.  When rules are being enforced to the fullest extent with no leniency, oppression comes. Laws are made to keep order in society, but there has to be limits where it is actually okay to overlook (Not so much that the rule is practically void). You wouldn't like that, right? Same thing goes for being nice. There should be a point where a person must draw a line, as well. Otherwise, you can hurt those around you in ways you would not dare to imagine.  In my opinion, a truly good person is one who makes decision in life by following what HE feels is the best, the most just, without concerning the opinion of the others. Certainly, everyone knows the cliche "Be yourself". According to the Empress Sekishi(may she live a long life), who lives north from where I come from, to be a truly good person, one should believe what he believes in and be nice to people he wants to befriend with, without any conditions. It is old but true. Sekishi, was too, a people- pleaser until she comes to Kou, where she slowly discovers her true self. Had she not realized the quality of a good person, she would have never defeated the demon in that blade of hers...  Anyway... there seems so many more things that must be achieved to become a good person. It's going to be horrible to read if I put all of the things down in one post. Feel free to leave a message to the ministers, now. I will be back shortly(Emperors are stupid sometimes).

      All I can say now is... Hi! I'm new here, so if I say anything offensive here, tell me. By the way, if you have anymore spare time, go visit dirsian, theevocator, and currycow's blogs.  They actually have the guts the say what's in their minds.
