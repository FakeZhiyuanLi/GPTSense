      promlems never stops coming..they come..they go..if u surrender and teps back..people will say you're a coward.. no matter how bad it is..FACE IT! my problem is.. yah.. as usual.. having internal problem with my basketball team mates..i son't know why..but i really hope i will be solved as soon as possible..well..the point is..i'm damned worry of my team..they seem to have confidence in their selves.. ok that's fine but the kind of confidence they have is unusual..kind of Berlagak! I don't know if i'm the only person feeling this..maybe because i'm worrying too much.. but i really just hope that it is my worrying or else my greatest nightmare will come true..maybe because i'm not a good leader but how can they judge me for not being good?? To me a good leader is formed by good followers..and maybe i'm not good enough to have my own followers...yeah..there maybe some mistakes that i've done ..but please..tell me!

      today as usual but something happened that maybe someday will change everything...chatted with someone whom i know for a very long time..she's very attractive..but the important thing is..why it sound different this time?..and i mean very-very different..she seemed to be a bit (maybe a lot) brave than before..asking me wild and open questions..as if..she has the idea tht i'm admiring her all the time..it is undeniable tht i may have a crush on her before..but now..i don't know..even though i have my own princess..GOD! HELP ME!! I don't wanna hurt one of them but at the same time i MAY have the same feelin' on both of them..MAN!! what's happening to me?? The worse thing is..she wants to follow me to u.k when i'm furthering my studies..living with me for at least 5 years..hey..wht's happening to this world? has it turned upside down? does she has other meaning behind her words just now?? I DON'T KNOW!   National level basketball competition is next week.. Practice? Just as usual..informal because my coach is not around.. Can't wait for it to end as soon as possible..will be damn tired after that..maybe have to cancel my plan to apply for the driving license.. but i dunno..it depends on situation..

      today..teacher's day!no EXAM!nothing much..just celebration..but without me as one of the people-in-charge..  surfed the web..found some information abt engineering courses in UK.. submitted the application form...hahaha..guess what..i submitted for courses tht will be started during winter 2005...what a rush..just imagine..a year after SPM dah fly..really-really cool..but i'm not depending 100% on tht application..just wanna see if i'm lucky or not..and tht's not part of my masterplan..i hv my own goals to achive and i don't wait for it..as the france proverb says "je ne cherche pas, je trouve" (i do not seek,i find) and tht's wht i'm gonna do... BUT if i'm lucky, given the opportunity, i'll grab it..not stupid enough to let it go..  t'morrow..physics paper..i don't hv any target yet..maybe b'coz i hvn't prepared yet..but it's the part of the plan..i wanna see my true ability..just face the exam without any preparation..i hv to sacrifice my mid year exam because this is the first time sitting for the real examination format question papers..sorry mum, dad, princess and teachers...maybe i'll let u all a bit down this time..but as i said before..it's a part of my plan..nevermind..after this, i'll be extremely serious for my trial exam..and straight As is my target..that's my promise

ONLY if i pass this year's exam with flying colours...   nothin'uch happen this week.. as usual lah.. but there's thick haze coming from indonesia..(if i'm not mistaken) yah my sch was also covered by the haze.. woooho... thank god i didn't get lost in ma own sch.. as ma sch is located on top of a hill..( it's kind of place tht's really  suitable to set up resorts or condominiums here...heheh...cool huh..)..the haze is thicker up here.. eyesight is about 100-150 metres only.. damn.. but it had gone already.. thought of getting an airmask or something(duh)... i'm kind of concerned about my health.. don't wanna get asthma just becoz breathin' n this low class air.. but now..the air is clear again.. can see the city of malacca.. the mitc .. know wht..i've just discovered a very-very nice spot at ma sch just now.. a very beautiful view of malacca city at night from the hillside.. very romantic for couples..wahaha  just a few days ago...have to go to the clinic coz my stomach was aching badly.. man!! and i mean it was very bad.. it was like my tummy is going to burst... damned it..then at the same day i got the same damn aching as well... really pissed off.. rushed to the hospital but this time to the emergency room..

      hahaha...mid year exam..my results went down..a very GOOD challenge for me to boost up my performance after this especially in the trials..   last night.. there was a session between the form 5 students and my sch's ex students.. wow..dunno i got some cool ex-students.. one of them was an engineer.. just three years came back to malaysia.. he's noow 35.. just imagine how long he's overseas.. he circled the world three times and there's only two countries he haven't been to yet..that is new zealand and nepal.. he's really cool and really enjoys his life to the max! though has a degree in engineering, now he works as a restaurant manager.. been chosen as the best restaurant manager for pizza hut in malaysia last year.. yeah.. he's really cool..  life has been always fine.. a little bit more happier.. yalah..must be happy what got another gf.. what the heck?! huh..dunno.. but the truth is i can't deny my feelings anymore.. 5 years suffering.. thank god i still survive.. after everything has been spoken.. i couldn't take it anymore.. this love must go on.. though i have someone.. but i'm only a human.. human always change.. maybe it is hard for me to do it and this is not bullshit.. hurting someone is the most cruel thing to do.. but what can i do? my heart has change.. i've had a crush with this new girl yers before i met my present gf and now as both have already known that the both of us have the same feelings with each other what can we do? have to carry on and don't lie our feelings again.. a love is not a love unless it is spoken and now is has already been spoken what are we waiting for?? no way i'm gonna leave this chance of a lifetime to be with someone that i really wanted and it worth a try

      long time i have not blogged..busy maa...although it is mid year holiday..still have to go to the library to do my revision..updated target.. 100% for add-math... crazy huh?? but worthy having high expectations in your life because u will strive to achive it.. and if the target is not achieved.. u have done the very best..that's important..  this new girl..WoW.... a love that is ignored..left..unanswered.. at last revealed..finally both of us know each and others heart.. but is it a game?? her game? no i doon't think so.. how come she can be so cruel.. everything that is kept in each others' heart have been heard and amazingly both of us have the same feelings but denied it.. but weird huh??loving your dads cousin? but still there are no restrictions in islam.. love is blind.. anything can happen.. it is not love if it is not being spoken.. though both knew each others' heart.. still there are fear.. fear of being tear apart by distance and time.. and life must go on.. a deal made.. later.. in 10 years time.. if still both of us are singles.. then.. that's the destiny.. destiny for us to be together.. 10 years.. not a short period of time.. even a second in the real world can cause a big change in life than how about 10 years?? if still there are love between us in the next 10 years than that love is totally pure and belongs to us..  met this girl just now.. came here to visit her relative.. >that is my grandpa.. still she's very cute.. but both of us turned speechless.. don't know what happened.. seems like there's a barrier between us to talk lively in realtime world but in the msn seems no trouble talking with each other.. maybe 'kemesraan' yang terjalin during our chat lasts only when we're chatting.. but not in realtime..in the real world 'kemesraan' yang diimpikan must be created by actions.. face to face.. plus both seems to be shy with each other.. hahahaha... don't know how come i can be shy with her.. mann... plus my grandpa, auntie, and her family keep talking about both of us.. mestilah dua-dua jadi segan! ..   my princess..  well i still love u.. we have not seen our destiny yet.. maybe i'm meant to be with u.. or with her.. or with someone else.. or maybe BOTH??? hey.. r u crazy? duh! life is really crazy.. confusing..  but still i need u..  studies..a few steps after this.. is the trial exam.. i MUST do VERY WELL.. target > 10 1As ..no sweat.. must get that.. must clear my bad record in school and i know i can achieve this.. NOTHING can stop me for this except death... hahahaha.. macam nak pegi berperang pulak.. but exam is a kind of war.. have to sacrifice to gain victory and the victory is getting perfect 1As... i know i can do this!
