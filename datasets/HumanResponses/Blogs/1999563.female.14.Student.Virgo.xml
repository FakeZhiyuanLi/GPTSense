I'm going to go screaming into the night now, so please post, so that I don't have to babble on like this again!!!!   Au Revoir

      Wow, I just remembered what my nightmare was about!! Someone let Dianna from school post on our blog!! I don't know what my sub-concious was thinking to make me have a dream like that, but it was terrifying!! And all she posted about was how cool she was and how obsessed with Nate Bjur she was!!! Wow, I'm scarying myself all over again!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh........   Au Revoir

Oh well, what is really sad is that all she talked about was Nicholas! She's more obsessed than we ever thought!!! Ooooo, and Abby's coming soooooon!!!!   Au Revoir

      I think it's broken, though. So sad.  I remember the day I got it. 5/7 of my family was on vacation and we were staying in a hotel in this little hickish town called Mariposa. My parents and sister went for a walk around town and looked at the little shops and when they came back they brought many treasures back with them - one being my preciousss and another being the location of a store that sold Drumsticks. Yum. Oh, right. Getting off topic... my parents had wanted to buy me this ring cause of the Relient K song. I had put it on one of the many tapes I had made for the trip and they loved it. So, when they saw the mood ring sitting on the shop counter, they thought of me. How grand is that? When they saw a symbol of moodiness, they thought of me =P   I forget my point for sharing this delightful tale but hey, it's summer and it's not like I've got anything better to do that share pointless stories. Thank you and good day.

      Its seems odd that the smplest thing in the world could be the most tasty. Sticky rice is like my all time favorite food. (that and lemon grass soup!)  I had it on monday night and it was reaaaallllllly good!  Yum yum! I could eat it all day!

Break or cut into bite size peices. Chips and tacos: Do not bite into. Subsitiute patato chips or flour tortillas Meat with bones: Do not bite off the bone. Cut meat from the bone Sticky candy: Do not chew. Soda: Rinse with water after drinking. Ice: Do not chew. Popcorn: Do not eat. Gum: Do not chew.   Wow.

      I got my braces on today. I look like a cross between a rabies infested rabiit and a dog. Its great! Haha. Good thing its summer so no one will have to see me. Except for all the church people. But they don't matter.  I decided to get the clear braces and from far away you cant even tell I have braces. But then if your, at most, 3 feet away you can totally see them. Oh well.  I can't wiat till I get them off. I h ave two years. I decided I am going to do EVERYTHING they tell me. I am sure everyone says that but then stops doing it after they have had their braces for awhile. But, I am gonna do it!  I will update you on how it goes. :)

      I wrote this poem in December when I was pretty depressed. It doens't have a name, but thats ok!  Every step I take I fall back three  I never get it right I guess it wasn’t meant to be  I wanna be like you I wanna serve you  But I feel I can’t Its just so hard.  I try I get up again  But then I fall Fall back down.   Theres nothing good in me Its all you.  This life this heart I give it up  Please, do somethign good with it   I am stuck in this whirl wind  Or should I call it  atronado.  It never stops. It just keeps swirling around  round and round   I’m ina prison without bars I can’t escape  I try but the force is to strong  I want to be loved I wanna be held

      HI! School today was..well interesting. I have decided that Tricia's famous saying "boys are bad God is good" Is REALLLY true. These guys  named Eric and Evan sit behin dme in Spanish and  they were all talking about how today was a good day because the first thing they saw was a buncha girls in tight pants....:O Then they were talking about how hot cheerleaders are. *Sigh* When will the one come for me? I keep thinking that SOME day God will put the perfect guy in my life so loves me for WHO I am not if I look good in tight pants. It feels like I will never find the one.  Today I went to rowing. I GOT TO GO WITH THE NEWBIES! Oooh my goodness! It was so much fun! I was like the best person in the boat so I got to stroke. It was so sitnkin cool.. I was with the fun newbies too. We sang "Row, Row, Row, the Boat," had a joke contest, and talked about random stuff. It was soo much fun!  When we were lifting the boat out of the water Emily's glasssed fell of and INTO the water! :O It was badd....I do not know th eoutcome of the situation though cuz I had to leave early.  Today these construction peoples came to our house to dig a huge hole in our yard and they CUT THE WATER PIPE. So we didn't have any water till like   a half an hour ago. I couldn't use the bathroom and I had to go realllllllllly bad. It was not fun. So we went out to eat cuz my mom couldn't cook. It was greta. We went to Baha Fresh and I got enchaladas. YUM! Then we went straight to youth group. Youth group was so much fun tonight! Its good to have a break from life and focus on God. After, we went to the christian book store and I got my brand spankin NEW Thousand foot Krutch CD!!! YAY!  You should get it tooo.   Uh oh.  My mom is making me leave. EEPs!  BYE! I love YOU! :D  ~Laurinaaaaa~

      Today school was slightly boring, go figure. I mean really fun and shcool are definatly oxymorons. In English got to have a current event disscussion!!!!!! It was SO much fun!!! Zane kept getting mad at Tony because there oppions greatly differ. Hahha... It was grand.  In science we just sat there. Well...we did something. I obviously wasn't paying attention though since I do not remember anything I "learned" The rest of school went on and on like that. Quite intertaining if I do say so myself. Wait....that doesn't make sense I just said it wasn't fun  *sigh* what shall I ever do with myself.  One FUNNNN thing happened! Well...WAIT! The thing in English was fun toooo. Oh goodness...my mom is making me SET the TABLEEE. The nerve. I shall have to finish my happy story later. Much love, Lauraaaaa

      Dude. The blow drying was like missing. I looked everywhere. It was bad. I coudln't find it. So I had to wake up my sleeping mother so she could tell me where it is. But,the front of my hair dryed before its discovery so now I am going to have to straighten my hair. AHH! I hate straightening.  I am off to put my contacts in! (Don't you love this? Haha...a minute by minute update of my hectic mornings! :P)  Love, Laura

      Hi everyone!!!!! (All one of you :p ) Last night was BLEEHHH. Yeah, pretty much. We went to a baptism service that was kinda cool. I never knew the had a bathtub permanatly under the stage. That was weird. Last night my sister made me TURN OFF the light when I was reading, I yelled. I tried to think of the best insult I could say without getting in trouble. I came up with "you need to grow up" Pretty pathetic, eh?? :o) The only reason I was mad that she wanted the light OFF was because she LOVVESS to sleep with the light ON. What a loser head. See....the only reason she wanted me to turn off the light is because she knew it would make me angry then she could get me in trouble....Does that make any sense at all? I think it does! Mwa hahaha...I should be a phycologist. But, first, I need to learn how to spell that. Right now it is 6:14. I just got out of the shower. I hate showers!!! :P  Random Thoughts... I am sooo tired. I wonder what I will do today I forgot to practice my piano AHHH My teacher is going ot be angry I hope she doesn't yell I currently weigh 10 pounds for than Karsen, if that will means anything in my lifetime.  I am off to blow dry my hair! Ugh...blow drying is one of the unessasary evils of this day in age.  I am out like a  light  Laura

      Hey!!!!!! This is my brand new spiffy blog. My awesomely cool cousins convinced me the go with the flow and make one so here it is. Are you happy now???  Today I went to church. We sat in the sleeper section. Its the funniest thing ever.  All that REALLY tired people sit in the back left corner.  5 people in the row next to us fell asleep. It was funny. I laughed. I was soooooooooooo tired, I almost fell asleep to! It must be the air over there.....  Sunshine wasn't there. My life is curently very cloudy. It kinda sucks...hahhaha... Life *inhales vigorously* hahahhaha get it? as in sucks? Hahha...ok never mind. Sometimes people just don't understand. Sometimes i think I am the only one who gets anything about myself at all. Like on Thrusday night when I almost got eaten by a cougar...nobody understood that. They were like "What...?"  Well...sinca ya'll are probably curious by tnow I will tell the story.  I was studying for this stupid spanish test and i was having a super horrible day. It was about 8:30 at night. The best thing to do on days like that is to go alone and cry + think. Considering there is NOWHERE to go in my house where you will be alone I deicded to "run away" So I ran and ran until I couldn't run anymore and I sat on the ground and just cried. It was quite depressing.  All one the sudden this huge thing jumps up out at me. I was sooo stinkin' scared that I started to sprint super fast home. It  chased my all the way. I ran into my house. I leaned against the wall a breathed in. I was finally safe! I then noticed my whole body was shacking and the tears were still pouring. Then all my dad came running and he was like "Are you ok???"  So I sat down and ate a ton of fruit snacks. It helped a lot. I got an ok grade on my test. It was aa miracle. Thank goodness for  cougars.  Random Thoughts!  CAM's mascot is a cougar..... Ridgefield is finally winning football games   My friend goes to ridgefield She went to homecoming with a BOY (oooooh! "I can't beileve her parents are letting her" Hahha....thats what my mom said *sigh* *rolls eyes*) I am going to attempt to sew my dress for Winter Formal. The pattern is absolutely gorgeous. I will look awesomely gorgeous. If I learn to sew. Gosh, cheese is good.   I found this poem on the internet and I absolutely love it so I thought I would share it with ya'll  It's Not Easy (Being Me) By: Joyesse  Don't come too close,  Please stay at bay,  For you won't like what you see.  The facade so quickly fades away,  It's not easy being me.  Hidden behind a counterfeit smile,  A peevish personality,  Is lurking till the smallest trial Brings out the worst in me.  Like a bomb assembled to ignite Or a fault beneath the sea,  Is an ever raging, brewing fight Alive inside of me.  Released then swallowed by remorse,  Guilt with perplexity.  Is there redemption, help, recourse,  For a sinner such as me?  Then my eyes are turned to another land Fixed on a center tree.  And the blood which pours from two outstretched hands,  Offer hope and forgiveness to me.  So come if you will, but please look away From my faults - for many there be!  When the work He's began is complete on "that day" I will be whole, I will be free   And it will be easier...  Later ya'll!  Goodbye with love and cheese-  Laura

           Yesterday was a grand day!!! School was pretty normal. I had to read Great Expectations out loud but she gave me a marshmallow! Side note.. Wow I just got scared to death. I can bareley type! Lol! My dad came home from taking my grandparents to the airport but I didn't even know he was gone so I saw this shadow and I like jumped up and stared screaming. Lol!!! I hope I didn't wake anyone up...man....my hands are STILL shaking!  Any who... When I got home I began to memorize a section of Anne Frank for CYT. I got it allll memorized!!! Yipppe! But then I didn't even have to say it... :/ Oh welll! When my mom got home from taking Hannah to piano she brought me a pepermint milkshake from this little store on the corner called O'Bradys. YUMMMMMM! Then we all went tot CYT. CYT was great fun, of course ;) We practiced thigns for our showcase.  In the middle of our performance I am supposed to start screaming. Lol. I hope I am brave enough to do it. :D Yum fun fun.  Then, right after CYT, my mom and I headed over to portland to go to this Dartmouth thing. I wanna go there soooo bad! You have to be SUPER SMART and SUPER RICH to go there- neither of which I am, so it might not be a possibility ;) It cost 40,000 DOLLARS a YEAR to go there!!! Isn't that crazy???? Its such and awesome school though. Last year they had a winter carnival and they carved a ginat GANDALF out of snow!!! Is that cool or what?!  It was 3 stories tall!!!!! :)  After than we went to burgerville so I could FINALLY eat dinner! It was about 9:30 :D ˆ was HUNRY! I got chicken strips and a PUMPKIN MILKSHAKE! Those are SO stinkin' good. They taste like your eating a pumpkin pie. Yummmm.  Then..I went home. And went to bed! Now I am out of bed. That is all. CD of the day!!!!! Relient K CHRISTMAS!!! Gosh, it rocks. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!!   Love,  Lauraaaa fantooora AKA....ozzy. :p

I hope they don't kill me. Yikes! :)  Last night was pretty dull. Our  internet stopped working, because of the solar flares, for a WHOLE HOUR! That was the borringest hour of my whole life.  Today I am going to school, CYT, and this person from Dartmouth is having a college seminar so I am obviously going. I cna't wait till college!! Yipppeee! I hope I get a scholarship for crew. I have heard they are pretty easy to get..we shall see! :)  Yippeee!  I am in a happy happy mood.  OOoh! My mom went to urban outfitters last night with my dad to get some shoes for Hannah but they don't fit! Yay!!! That means I get to go to UO and get them returned!!! Then I will probably purchase some clothes and my POINTY FLATS!!!! YESSSSS! As long as my comatose brother cleans the windoes dwnstairs because he "Did have enough time to finish"  Loser head.   :D  I better go blow dry.  I love YOU!  Laura  P.S.

           My brothers obeo teacher is over..... Hmm...  Today, after everyone in my family left, I cleaned my room. Then Freddy came over to study spanish with Matt. BUt, Matt wasn't home. So he sat around my house for 45 minutes until my brother came home..it was a little interesssttting.  So I finished cleaning then I read a REALLLY good book calle d "Rachels Tears" Its about the girl who was killed at columbine. It was really inspiring. I want to  live my live more like her. right now I am cooking some noodles because I am super HUNGY!  Tonight my mom cooked the best tasting spageti ever. I don't know how I will survive in  college without her yummy food.  Speaking of college..I CANT WAIT!!!!!! Tomorrow i am going to this thing for Dartmouth colege. I don't really want to go there btu I might as well check it out. I think I want to go somewhere in the east coast. I have wanted to go to University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since I was like 7 (seriously!) So I might try to get a crew scholarship there. I am going to try a ton of places though. And see what ones i get into then make my decision. I can't wait for COLLLEGE! Yipppee!   Laura

            I hate Wednesdays. Yuck.  They are immensly boring. I woke up at 9 but I felt way to sick to get up (notice a patern? :D  )  So I read in my bed till 10ish. Then I got up. I walked down stairs and ate some halloween candy. Yumm!  Then I watched Regis and Kathy Lee. Oh wait! Its not Kathy Lee any more...what is that persons name??? Ooooh yeah! Kelly Rippa.  But instead of Regis is was Pat Sajak, from wheoe o' fortune. YAY! He rocks!! They had that guy from the O.C. that Meagan G. is obbsessed with. Haha. He is one ugly dukling. ;) Acctually, he wasn't that bad. But any ways....Then I  had a piece of nasty pizza and we had to clean. My dad THREATENED my brother. It was GREAT! My brother is super scary so my dad told him that if he said or did anything mean to ME he would be in HUGGGGGE trouble. It was great. Then my brother goes "I never do anything to HER, she is the mean one!!" Riiiighhht.  I laughed.  So we cleaned.  I made him clean our WINDOWS! hahhaha! Its the worst job on the planet because our house is infested by bugs so there are about 20 dead bugs in each window sill. Its pretty sick. So I got my mom to make him clean the windows. HAHHAHA! He was SOOO stinking mad! It was great.  Then....we said he was going to CLEAN THE SHOWER BUUUUUUUTTTTT he was acctually in his ROOM! For a half an hour while I was slaving away! I was SUPER SUPER MAD. SO I told me mom abotu all his lies and deciet and she threatened to fire ME! Poor little me! Who would want to fire ME? :D I am the GOOD one. So I almost told her about  how I caught my brother skipping class and how he ate a bag of the candy we are supposed to save for trick-or-treaters but I was to scared of what my brother would do to me. YIKES!  Now I am "home alone" but there are 5 guys here. Haha. Olive, 3 construction workers, and the tree removing guy who is off somewhere grinding stumps. Its a little scary. I hope our hosue gets finished SOON! I don't think I can last any longer!    My parents are going out to eat tonight and so I has to be alone with my brother. YIIIIIKKKEs! Good thing I didn't tell my mom everything he did or else he woulld probably beat me up. Yikes. I am afraid to live in this hosue with him...   I better go!  Adios lovely amigos!

            ohh...where to start! Hmm  Well...at school we had "THE" Assembaly...it was interestting. I had to lead hollywood (Holly Would...hahah...thats the coolest brand- the clothes are SO cute! Any who....)  squares...it was INTERESTING. I kept pronouncing words wrong. Lol. Then we had the freshman "reward" Yuck. They shaved a water balloon with whipped cream all over it on our head. It was quite interesting. I was SO stinking wet! Then I had to go to a spanish "workshop"  She gave us all 3 points extra credit for just BEING there! Mwa haha. It was grand. Then on Tuesday Megan, SHOOOT! I forgot her name. I am a dork. :) Lol. I love you.  Well any who...we are singing a song about chickens and we get another 3 points! Yippe!  After school I went to row. It was alright! We just washed the boats and such. Quite intertaining.   Then we RUSHED home. I hopped in the shower and tried to get all the whipped cream out of my luverly hair. I succeded! Then I ran down stairs and grabbed some chinese food. I blow-dryed my hair while eating my dinner.  It was quite intereesting. Because I blow dry my hair upside down (if that makes any sense at all... :D )  So I kept chocking on egg roll. Its hard to eat up side down.  Then Sara came and we picked up Lori Ann then headed the the dance. The dance was really fun acctually. Better than expected. Only one freshman guy showed up. I was happy because i couldn't be myself with those guys there... :/     THEN! we went home at 10:30 and "my feet hurt so stinkin' bad"  (TRICIA!) So I went to bed at about 11.    At 5 i had to wake up because we had a rowing reggetta! It was pretty fun. My boat got 5 place. The boys varsity got 2, girls vasity got 3, and I think the boys varsity got like last. Hahah.   So....thats pretty much it.  Oh yeah. I am runnign away. Hahhahaha...My mom said I was fat last night and she just keeps insulting me. It makes me so mad. I just run into the forest, sit on a log, and cry. I love crying. It always seems to make me happy.  I think I am going to save money to buy a plane ticket to MANDY'S HOUSE! That would so stinkin' rock.   I better go.  Much love,  Lauraaaa   P.S. I am so not fat.

For a while I thought there was a problem with my account but I sent myself a letter and i got it so there obviously isn't.   BE A PAL!  Send ME an e-mail at shinymonkey56@hotmail.com  Rock on.

            anywho... As I was saying-  You may think you know me but you really don't.   *~What you are about to read is a little secret between you and I, use it wisely.*~  First of all, I absolutely love myself. This may not seem aparent but its totally true. Like when I do something good, make myself happy, or even if I am super sad. I do this thign where in my mind I yell "GROUP HUG!" Then I hug myself...this may seem kinda weird, but what can I say. It makes me happy. I did it today in Sara's car because I needed some cheering up! :D  Second....I do all these weird things in ym head...I tell myself jokes and make myself laugh... :D Its greta to be happy! Hahahhahahah  Well...thats about it for my blogging today :)  Love, Lauraaa

           I never thought I could be so atached to a possesion before.  Today Sara and I traded shoes. At first I was like "i wont miss 'em..they are just a pair of shoes" But when I saw Sara wearing 'em I  was like "THOSE SHOULD BE ON MY FEET!"   Oh well..I will get 'em back tomorrow. I think I can survive..I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.  School was kinda blllehhh. We didi absolutely NOTHING!  In scieence we got to make shapes out of straws which was kinda fun, have I ever told you how much I love straws? Well...I don't tell many people a lot about me. You may think..UH OH! Mid sentence...must go empty the dishwasher..don't worry- I will be back!

Man, I loved it SO stinking much. I think I am going to read it again. I just got the book last night and I already read it.     Man...I love that book! I have already said that a billion times but this is definatly on my list of favorite boooks.  Today I went to church. It was church. Same ol....  Then my parents had this great idea to go out to eat at this freak restaurant. It was in the creepy part of portland.  Just about EVERYTHING was made out of tofu. It  was absolutely disgusting. Not to mention our waiter :P He looked like he weighed 75 pounds. Haha. The whole restaurant was DIRTY too. It was pretty sickk... :)  Now I am doing nothing....lalalalla.  So. I guess thats all  RANDOMNESS! I am watching the news!  I love the news! Hahahha It is showing a blazers comercail. Yuck.  The blazers are super bad They are all crack addicts Haha. Remember mandy how we are CRACK HEADS? Lol That was great.   Well...I better go.  Love, Laura   P.S.  READ THAT BOOK!

            So. For the last two days I have only ate a burrito and a garden burger. Gosh I freak myself out. I am trying to drop my weight to 100. Thats horrible. I dunno. I have never thought about what I am getting myself into. It makes me want to cry. So I have decided to blame it on Hana Sokpuva, my all time favorite model. I bet she weighs 100. She is gorgeous. Maybe if I loose weight I will be as pretty as her.  So, i went to the christian book store today and got a book on anorxia. Its a good book. It makes me sad that I ever considered this. I love myself. I think I am perfect. (look wise) Well..except for my crooked finger. Now i can never be a model. Well, now I am off to watch TBN.   Lay-tah  Laura   P.S. How does this sound for my new rap album? :P  comin' out the underground straight from the top while my beats drop never gonna stop ti'll my tapes pop, never lookin back never lettin go with the mad flow cuz you know i'm unleashed 'till the get go   I think it rocks.  Are rappers skinny?  I hope not. I don't think I can stand this any longer.  I am off to go eat fat-free yogurt.   Or maybe not.  I don't want to get fat.  Fat is bad.

Here is my blogging from thursday and friday :)  Thursday- 9:30 PM Oh gosh,,,,so many blog worthy things happend today, but I wasn't able to post any of them because my stupid sister got my in trouble.  On Wednesday I used like 5 minutes more than my time and my sister  told my mom so I can't use the computer for 2 WHOLE DAYS!!!! Shoot me while I am still alive. So now I have absolutely nothing to do. I think I am going to kill myself :P Oooooooh! I will tell you about my day. I woke up at 6:45. Ahh! It was bad. Then my brother was in the shower so I couldn't use it for a lonnnng time. So finally I got in the shower and took a 10 minute showe. Then I blow dryed my hair and put crap on my face :P  I looked suppper bad :P  Then Sara picked us up.  Nothing interesting happened  until lunch....  Taylor threw her apple at me for some reason. The apple then hit my can of sprite which then spilled ALLLLLLLLLLL over me!  It was so stinkin' funny! We laughed till we seriously cryed. But then my pants were all wet and sticky. Yuck.   Then I went to CYT. It was fun. I saw htis guy named Tim...he is cool Then i met  this other guy who is a freestlye rapper, which is obviously my dream job. :P  Then I was saying good bye to this kid named Kaysee and for some reason I said "Bye...you" to him and in this REALLY creepy voice he goes "Just call me...blue eye lover..." then he smiled weirdly. I was wearing my blue contacts..it creeped me out. What a loser head. Now I am computerless which really sucks.  to     bad                  i                          don't have   aaaaaa LIFE!

            Last night I went to a Superchick concert. It was awesome. So... everyone arived at my house at about 2:15.  Then we made our sandwiches for dinner. Then I grabed the tonnnnnnns of bags of candy (mwa hahahha) and we headed to the car. By the time we got in the car it was like 3:40 and I was like AHHHH! WE ARE GONNA BE LATE FOR BEING EARLY!  So we headed towards Kaizer. Buttttt we got stuck the the HUGGEEEE traffic jam  I started to freak out....  So we were all like "Lalallalal...when will this ever end?" Then is FINALLY ended and it was about 4:30 and we still had 30 miles to go!!! But at least we were going fast again! yay! So we ate TONNNNS of candy and got SUPER DUPER hyper! Mwa haha! We were like singing the who0le way there. It was grand. On the way there we were listening to a little kids station. It was sooooo much fun! It was the "Absolutely Mindy Show" It was wild. Being as hyper as we all were, we decided to call Mindy and yell and scream like  lunatics. She picked up the phone as was like "HI! Itttttttttttts Mindy!!!" So we alllllllllll screamed and she was like "Uh......okaaaaaaaay" Then we sang to her "You are my sunshine"  FINALLY, after more than an hour, we saw our EXIT!!! YAYYYYY! We all screamed for JOY!  We finally arived at the church and I saw HEATHHEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!!! YAY! I was like "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH THATS HEATHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and everyone was like "uh..who is Heather?" ( Heatehjr is my awesome Superchicky friend!) So we parked and I ran out with my SUPER DUPER COOL strawberry sunglasses!  So i talked to Heather, her sister, and this guy in front of us who is obbsessed with superchick. It was cooooool! Then I looked at Heathers awesome photo album! So we got there baout 2 hours early, I just sat on the pavement, ate a bunch of candy, and talked to the other people. Then Kelsy (sp?) howed up. (My other superchicky friend!) JI didn't even know what she looked like or anything but we KNEW it was her right when she came! She was pertty spiftacular. She showed us her superchick folder and she just talked. Her brother was there tooo. He was coool. I kept hitting him on the head while we were in the mosh pit though.  :/ FINALLY they opened the doors and we were like *w00t* We finally get to go in!! But they didn't let us in. Grrrrrrr! We had to wait in a line at the door to the sanctuary for like a half an hour. it was sooooooo boring. All these people kept going in and out of the doors- everytime we thought we would get to go in, but they would never let us in. GR! Finnnallly, they let us in. But then we had to wait for another half an hour. GRRRRRR! Finally Sending Jonah started. They were ok..not really my style though. I was SUPER impatient so I was all like "WHEN WILL THIS EVER END?" And I think I said it a little to loud.  They played about 5 songs...then they left. I was like "YAYYY! SUPERCHICK TIME!" Then they had to give out alllllllllll this free stuff. GRRRR!!! Then FINALLY superchick started!!! Yay! It was awesome...expect for the whole mosh pit thing... There was like a 5 year old girl right next to me. It was pretty crazy. At least Heather and I jumped!!!!!!  It was a pretty normal concert..... OOOOOH! SKWID WAS WEARING A SANTA SUIT! It was sooooooooooo funnny!!!!!!  I took a tonnnnnn of pictures.  Then the concert ended and we went outside and sat by the merch tbale until there was no one left in the line for autographs. It was pretty spiffy! I got to talk to them for a long time and I got pictures with them! It was pretty funny because on Thursday I got my RE:Generation CD in the mail and I had them sign it. It was the FIRST TIME they had EVER seen the CD!!!!!!!!!!!! They were all like "Where did you get this?!?!?!?!?!" So they all passsed it around. Max thought "It turned out better than I thought it would!" Max wasn't at the autograph table and I really wanted to talk to him so Heather, Heather (my friend  ), Katie, Johanna, Sara, Heidi, and I waited out side the door for a lonnnnnnng time. Then Dave wentin where Max was and we told him to go get Max for us and he did! YAY! So we got to talk to Max for a long time! It was awesome! Then Melissa came up to me and put her arm on my sholder and was like "It was good to see you here tonight!" It was AWESOMMMMME! I was like "WHOA! HER ARM ON IS MY SHOULDER!"  Then we were all SUPER tired even though it was only 11:30 so we decided to go home. On our way home we got slurpees at 7/11. They were gooood! All the people in there looked at us super funny because we had our concert outfits on. Haha. It was great. Well..I guess whats all!

      Schoool....well lets start at the BEGINNING! I was SO tired  I turned off my alarm clock in my sleep.  I didn't wake up till 7:30!!!!!! AHHH! It was SO bad! So I put in my contacts and ran out the door...I just put on some jeans with my pajama top. Lol! So the day started off pretty stinky!  School  went prety much the same... We had an awesome sub in Spanish!!!!!! She was a  retired army conel.  She was spiftacular!  She read us this awesome poem in German!! It was about this kid dying..it was still cool though! :P  Then I went home ran inside and changed for rowing. Rowing was alright. I had to row with the newbies again. Bleh!  That Alexa person is SOOOO annoying. She thinks she is SO cool. She bugs me.    OOH!! At rowing....we pulled up just as a police car was pulling out and we were like "Um....ok.." So we drove up the the place where we meet and there was 3 POLICE CARS there!! They were handcuffing these two guys!!! We were all like "What is going on?!" As it turns out...these two dumb guys pretended to fish in the bay until Will (the main guy) rowed out. Once he left they went and took the CRAPPY ROW BOAT, beginning of their extreme stupidity. They tried to row away but they didn't have any paddles, Will obviously saw them.  He callled the police and caught up with the cirminals!  The police showed up...and end of story :) It was FUNNY!!! :)  When my mom was on the way to pick me up she got in a car wreck! :(  At first she thought the car was totalled but once she got out and looked at the car there was only minor damage...a 17 year old kid did it. :(  SO...we raced home and I ran inside and practiced my piano. Then we ate dinner- a small meal of beans and fish (yummy salmon!) and went to youth group. It was fun! I met a really cool girl who was wearing a Puma sweatshirt, which obviously means she is ON THE LIST :P  She had really pretty hair...it was down to her hip bone. :)  Thats how long my hair will be..eventually. :)  Now I am home...and doing NOTHING! :) That is all. So long!  Love, Laura

I got to go in every shop I wanted!!! :D  After much deliberation I purchased a skirt and a sweater for sadie hawkins.  They are soooooo coool! The skirt is like pin-striped. :D Yay!    Then my dad came and picked my sister and I up and we headed to the soccer game. We rode the monerail. (Sp?)  It took like a half an hour to get the PGE Park, where the game was being held. The train was sooooooooooo squished! I ould barely breathe!! When we finnally arived at PGE there was a HUGE line to get in! To we stood in line with all the crazy soccer fanatics....I took a picture. It was so awesome!!! There was the GIANT soccer ball....it was cool. Then there was a goal that you ttry to get a ball in and just random stuff like that. There were a bunch of people handing out free stuff. I got a necklace. There was also a band of drummers which was pretty spiftacular.:D They had face painting too! But we were in too much of a hurry that I couldn't get my face painted....waaa.  We also saw Ronald McDonald. It was prety scary!!!! He walked over to us and was like "Hi! How's is going??"     When we finaly intered the stadium the USA and German teams were warming up. We went to our seats and watched for a while, then I went and got a drink of water. It was so hot in ur seats because the sun had not gone down far enough yet so the sun was right in our eyes!   The game finally started!!! I thought US would win the WHOLE game. They played a  really good game but none of there shots would go in! It was sooo sad!  The game pretty much went the same...missed shots by US, made shots by Germany. It was super depressing!!!!!!! Finally US lost 3-0. Waaaaa! USA looked SOOO sad out there. They were like on bended knee with there head burried in their face. :( I took many pictures.  Then there was a long break. I just sat on our seats the whole time. My dad went to go get hot-dogs. They were kind of gross. :P  When Canada and Sweeden started to warm up on the field my brother, sister, and I went down to the front row seats and I took some pictures. My sister is a weirdo so she started to yell "GO BRITNEY!!!" and they guy who was standing nect to us goes "Who's Britney?" and mysister was like "Uh...I have no clue" *rolls eyes*  The game finally started, yipee!! Canada took over the game at the sart and quickly made a goal. I was super happy since Canada is reallly bad!!! :) But then Sweeden stole the game RIGHT and the very end and ended up winning 2-1. I was so sad!!  All the teams I rooted for lost, I think I am cursed.  Well...its time to go to school! I will write more later  Love, Laura

      HI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh gooodness! So much stuff since I last wrote!  Ok....friday.  The freshman WON color war. A gift, yet a curse! Now they get to torcher me in two weeks! Ah! I am really scared! Hahha.... Then I went right to rowing and I had the worst row I have EVER had in my LIFE. I was with Emily and these two other kids who where like going out or somethign cuz the whole time they were flirtying with eachother. It was SOO annoying. I wanted to throw 'em into the water :) And if that wasn't bad enough, they complained the whole row that they were tired so they stopped half way through and Emily and I had to row the 3 miles back by OURSELVES. GRR! I was SOOOOO mad!  *takes a deep breath*  Right after that I went home. They poured the concrete yesterday. So I packed my bag, changed clothes, did my hair, and stuffed a peice of pizza in my mouth. 5 minutes later I was out the door again! I went to Katies house. We went to the mall!!!!! It was SO much fun! Hahha...I picked out the skirt and shirt I am getting for the Sadie Hawkins. It is SO coool. Its pin-striped! Yay!!!!!!  Then we went home and watched Monty Pithon and the Holy Grail. It was Kaites first time! *wild applause* She now joins THE club!! She htought it was odd... *sigh* So we went to bed at 11-ish and woke up at 8. Then I ate a bagel and my dad came to pick me up. I went to go row. I had a much better row then yesterday!!!! It started to rain, though, which wasn't much fun.   My dad picked me up and we went to Fred Meyers to see the ocsar meyer wiener car!!! Hahha! It was SOO coool! We then went home and I took a shower. Then I went on the computer and that is where I am right now, updating my blog! :D  That is all!!!  Love, Laura  P.S. SUPERCHIC[K] INSTORE OCTOBER 23 AT CHRISTIAN SUPPLY.  Its absolutely FREE!! Be there, or be square!

            HI EVERYONE! I am in Cannon Beach right now. Yup!  I will tell you about yesterday..   OK, the beginning. My mom woke me up at 12 saying "Are you going to sleep all day?!" I was like No...its only 12!!  So I wok eup and ate some pizza. Then like 15 minutes later our POWER WENT OUT! So, being me, I freaked. "WHAT NOT TO WEAR MARATHON STARTS IN 2 HOURS!! I can't watch it if the power is out!"  So then my brother was all like "Your not a very good christian if all you care about is tv!!" So I was like "Right...."  So then we deiceded to go watch my brother and his best friend, Kyle, surf in the ocean. One problem, we had no clue where they were surfing at...so we drove around EVERY stinkin' where for like 2 hours trying to find them btu we couldn't. We got out at a few beached but considering we were in the middle of a stormy strom I went out then ran back to the car. Everyone else in my family was SOAKED!  Then we went home and it started to get dark, really dark. Our power was still out and we only had like 3 candle. I called Katie with my dads cellphone and we talked for a bit then I tried to read great expectations by candel light, an interesting experience to say the least.    I felt kidna like Biddy...I don't want to maryy Joe!!  At about 6 we started to kinda worry about Jacob and Kyle...it was pitch dark and really stormy. I waspretty scared that they were lost at sea or something.  Finally, at like 6:30 they came home, then we drove to find some place to eat where they had power, we drove for about 30 minutes then finally found a taco bell to eat at.  It was kinda nasty :)  Then we went home and the power was still out.  To end this story fast because I am almost out of time at the library, the power went on at about 10 P.M. and I got to watch the final 2 episodes of what not to wear.  :D  I love you guys!!  Laura

            Hi!  This sunday was pretty boring. I woke up at 11 and finished my collage. Then at 12 we went to Red Robin, we met my grandparents there. It was ok. I don't really like red robin though.  Yeah. I got fetticuine alfredo, my favorite!  Then we went home and I played the computer. Then we went to holly wodd video and I got two  musicals. I watched half of both of 'em, I didn't like either. I just cleaned my rooom now I am updating my blog.  YUp.

            Yup. Thursday. Bad bad bad.  For some reason I was super hungry. Hmm. I only ate lunch. That might be why..  ;)  So I went to ASB but it ended at 2:25 and my mom wouldn't come to 3 so I just sat around. I couldn't study for WA state history because my book was at home so I did absolutely nothing.  Fun.  Then I went home and like 5 minutes later I went to CYT.  I don't know if I will do Annie anymore. I don't really like CYT. I always seem to be a loner and out of the loop. I also can't sing, dance. or act.  Hmm.          My brother came come from New Zeland. Our teacher was sick so Anna took charge then Eliza kept yelling at everyone. I just wanted to hide in a little hole. The whole day I was stiffling back tears. I am a loser.  I want a friend I can tell everything.  One I can cry to.  One I can tell the achievements and not be put down.  One I can tell my failures too.  I just need someone.  I don't feel like I have any real friends.   At least I have you, blogger.

            Hi everyone!  All day long I have been studying spanish and washiington state history. YUCK!  Now I am watching a JFK show on PBS. Its awesome. I love history like this, not washington state history.  I love history from the 1800+ Its awesome. I want to be a history teacher. I would love that. I would bea  fun teacher. We would play history games and I could hand out candy.  I would also love to be a  teacher because you are so close to all these childrens lives. You can even change there hwole lives. I want to give every single child an oppurtunuity to be SMART and have many friends. I hate when people are all alone.  I think the only reason there is bullys in school violence and such is beacause first they are all alone. The "popular crowd" starts making fun of them. What do you think when someone makes fun fo you? if you are like me you get angry. Very angry. So these kids let out there anger on people.  If we could just be kind to everyone we could bring a stop to school violence.  It could happen. Think of Columbine, so many lives could have been saved if people would have been friend to the killers..   *sigh*  What a world....what a world.  Do people just not realize what that the thigns they do and say have such a great affect on a persons intire life?

            Yesterday was an absoutlely horrible day. I got in trouble 3 times in 2 minutes, I was blogging and I wasn't supposed too (?), I left the blow dryer down stairs, and something else that I don't remember now... :)  So, as a result I coudn't use the computer all day.  Yuck.   School was bad.  At lunch Zane and Ben got into a huge fight and Ben punched a hole in the wall and I was like right next to him so I had to talk to our principal about what happened and tell ehr what I saw. It was so stinkin' scary. I was like shaking.   Aaron joined the water bottle game yesterday!  He sat right next to me. That was *ahem* interesting.   If all those preppy girls want Aaron to look at them they should should start throwing water bottles at eachother, it works mighty fine!   Then I went to a going away party for me dear abby...:(  It was fun!  Then I went to church which was SUPER fun!  Then I went come and finished cleaning the house and studied for spanish.   Then this morning I woke up early cuz we had a field trip. We picked up Sara and went to school. Then we got on the bus and it started to snow. So we headed to portland and went to the art museum. When we were done they said we had to go back to school. It was SO sad because we were going ot go shopping but because of the snow we had to go home. Waaa   So we waited at school for 45 minutes then Sara's mom came and picked us up. Then I went home and played in the snow with my cute little neighbor and took pictures. :)  Now I am here.   All toasty warm.   And that my friend, is a quick overveiw the the last two days happenings.   Peace.  Laura

            Last night I had the scarriest dream ever. I dreamed that our school was bombed and everyone in our school died except for my sister and I.  It was absolutely horrible.  Now I am scared out of my wits....  I took a really short shower so there is still some shampoo in it...yuck!  Every little sound I hear I think its a bomd or someone coming to kill me. Our house is quite scary in the mornings, I can't wait for day light.   On a lighter note..  I really really want a digital camera for christmas! :D

            Thsi is what I did on Sunday afternoon...   Well....First we went home.  Then we headed to CYT and I sold a few raffell tickets. Then we left. We headed to Beaverton...It didn't take to long to get there.  On my way I saw a krispy kream..yum!  So first we went to this used clothes store. They didn't have anything good. So we went to Nordstrom rack, which is an awesome store. I tried on a few pairs on jeans and 2 winter formal dresses. Everything was ugly. :) It didn't really fit right. SO I went and looked at shoes.  They had so many good Pumas! But I can't buy pumas...so I steered away from the athletic asile and went to look for some pointy flats. I found on good pair.But then, suddenly my eyes caught a pair laying on the ground. HOLY MACARONI I screamed in my head, are those what I think they are. I picked them up  and felt the smooth black leather and the silver silleotte heel. I looked at the tag. Holy cow. These are the ones. My objects of affection first seen in Lucky magazine. I have wanted them for years. They were Marc Jacobs 400 dolar leather pointy high heels.  They were more than 80 percent off, only 60 bucks. They were stunning.  I ran over to my mom, LOOK AT THESE!!!   (Now heres the sad part)  They were size 10. I should have gotten them. They kind of fit, kinda.  *sigh* Those shoes are just a figment of my imagination now. They were too good for me.  Then, we went to Ross just in case they had a good dress for winter formal.  And boy oh boy, they did! Hhaha. I found this GORGEOUSSSS blue dress and I looked at the price tag, 20 bucks! I squealed with delight!  Its song and it has a low back with these criss crosy things. Its kind of hard to explain, but its pretty!   Then we went to Target and I got some earings to match.  Thennn...my dad took my mom and I to KRISPY KREAM! Yum!  Its mighty tasty.  Then we went back to CYT and got there right hwen the performance ended. I  found some friends and we walked around aimlessly for a bit.  Thenn...my friend  named..oh gosh. I don't even remember his name. Haha. Well he was all like"Hey, can I ask for a favor?" To me and Liz and we were like okkayyy... and the favor was TEE PEEING/ a SARAN WRAPPING BEKAH'S (the director) CAR! Hahhahah  It was the most fun ever. It was me, Liz, Elvis, and  Elvis's best friend- Malakai (I think I spelled it wrong)  First we put toilet paper alllll over it then we covered the toilet paper with SARAN!  It was soo much being,,ya know..being in the dark..with elvis. JOKING!  His best friend is almost as cool as  himself. He was wearing  a air1 sweatshirt and looked like matt theison.  While we were saran wrapping the car Malakai and Elvis were runnign around the car with the rolls so it would be coever (does that make sense? :) ) And I was standing there trying to get it stuck to the attenae and they wrapped the tiolet paper around me so I was stuck to the car. Hahha. It was quite amusing.  Then we ran away because Bekah paid these little kids to spy on us so she could make her revenge and Cody could only case them around the trees for so long.  :D  Then we were all soaking wet and cold so we ran back inside right intime for the party to start. First they gave out awards. Blah blah blah. Then they did the secret pal thing. More blah. Then we ate PIZZA!  Yumm yumm.  Then they did these little skit thigns called strikes. They were quite amusin. By then it was 10 so we al headed home and squirmed into our little beddies *cough SCOOBY DOO SHEETS! cough cough***   THE END!

            Why do I  have to be born this way?  Why can't I be like all the other girls?  Pretty, skinny, smart, popular- Perfect.  Why, I ask? Because I am a christian, I don't want to be like everyone else. I  want people to wonder what is different about me. A difference.  I want to make a change, I want to touch lifes.  I don't just want to be popular or pretty.    Everyone doesn't have to like me.  Guy don't have no fall in love with my smile.  If I was the only one in the world who loved me, I would feel wonderful, because I have God.  I would keep going.  Never stop.   Laura

            Hi everyone! Today was an interesting day... I woke up at 6 and took a shower then at about 7 we headed to the theatre. I watched the first show and during the second show I read great expectations. Sadly, no contact with the sheriff. But, Sara was there! Yippee! So I just hung out at the theatre becasue they were taking pictures. I got invited to  aparty!! Haha. Elvis probably went. I didn't go because I thought Matt and I were going to clean but we ended up not cleaning. How annoying.  Right when I got home I went to my room and just cried because...I dunno. I guess I was sad. While I was laying on my pillow I guess I felll asleep. I just woke up. Haha.  Today was a dull day.  Love, Laura

            I found this poem @ mannacabana.com and I thought it was really pretty...  As the Master molds the clay, it’s a lump no one recognizes. Ugly formless its color is gray, nothing of care, nothing of beauty. Clipping, kneading, rolling with skill, stretching, forming, and pinching a shape. The Master is molding it to His will, the clay has nothing to say about it. Delicate features immerging now, taking shape before His eyes. Color and details starting to show, back into the fire for another round. When He looks at what He has done, admires the colors and glaze. In some ways He and the pot are one, it is a reflection of Him who made it. Empty and formless without direction, in a lot of ways that clay is me. Through the Lord was a resurrection, molded and formed in the Master’s hand.

           You know in our presentations in WA history, if Mr. Alber finds one spelling mistake in the whole thing you get a bad grade?  Well, thats how I feel about myself. If there is even one mistake, one little error, I feel like I am a bad person.  I make my whole self bad.    I am quite confusing. Well, I don't have any school today. I am "sick" so I am going to see if I can get out of rowing for today. This is my last week of rowing. Yippee!  I have to do soooo much school work. Yuck! Then I am going to church. Yippeee!

Did i tell you Taylor and I are quiting school? Hahaa. We are starting a homeschooling club! Yes! I wonder if the sheriff would like to join our club, I will have to ask him.  THE AARON UPDATE (Just for you, Mandy) Today....We had to do these hall of fame things (I am currently wining for most stylish!! Whats with that? I am not stylish...haha) and Katie and Lauren made Aaron vote for me for nicest. Haha. So I know I have at least 6 votes for niceest!  Ha ha  Uh oh. My brother is stealing the computer.

           Why is it...that sometimes I feel beautiful, yet sometimes I feel worthless and ugly? Sometimes I have worthand sometimes I am nothing?  Why do I always make myself mad? Why do I fret over the ones I love but not even care of the ones I do not know? Why do I care so much about what one guy thinks of me then suddenly he is gone, away from my presence. Whisked away never to be seen again.   How can I feel wonderful then suddenly go into a deep depression?   I just don't understand.  Yesterday I felt beautiful. I felt like the world was watching my every step.  Now I feel like a thorn on the bush, a mistake, never ment to happen.  I feel like when the world sees me they quickly look away. They don't even stop to talk.   All this because of one persons oppions. One persons scorn.  You may not have known how much you can effect one person. You can change there life.  Make that change.  Do the right.  You will be rewareded.   You don't evenhave to save there life.  Just say hi.  Smile.  Give them a  call, a hug. Anything really.   You don't know how much that little friendly emotion will do for that person.

           I just got back from the 7 o'clock show! It was grand!  I didn't watch it so I just stayed back stage with my friend and ELVIS'S sister!! Hahah. She was awesome.  She was 7, I think. She told us all of Elvis's depest darkest secrets. Well, not really. She told us what his room looked like. He has a scooby doo poster, a MXPX poster, and a "bunch of guitar stuff" Hahha. How cool is that.   I talked to him! Hahah. He said "Are you eyes really that blue? I go "No, they are contacts." "Oh...wow! They look really cool!"   It was a little uncomfortable though...considering I was standing in the guys DRESSING ROOM! Lol. It wasn't bad though. He wasjust about to take his shirt of when my friend and I walked in trying to find the owner of a sword we found. Haha. All these guys were changing wiht there shirts of. It was a little odd. :D  All the guys noticed me today. It was odd. They were all like "Your hair looks really pretty!" "I love your hair like that!" I was like ooookkkay. My hair wasn't all that great. Just these little twisty things. La la la  I don't think anything else exciting happened.  Right now my brother birthday thingy is happening. Haha. I am in a laughing mood. La de da de.  I better be going!  Talk to ya'll later!!   Laura

I also sell merchandise. Haha.  I just got back from target. I got my sister  a chirstmas present. I also bought some hallween candy for 9 cents. The candy has been the only thing I have eaten all day so now I feel a little sick. :)  I am going to keep a list of people I see at the shows.  3 O'clock Saturday. 3 People from church, Keary (she rocks!) her sister Amy, and this girl whose name is Britney. My ENGLISH teacher and her BOYFRIEND! Hahha That was a little scary. At least she is really nice. :D    I only saw Elvis  when my mom and I were walking down stairs to talk to Jennifer ( a girl from my school) about singing Matt the birthday song. :)   So yeah.  Now I am going back to the theatre.  Yipppeee! Haha

We went to an after show party. It was GREAT fun! But we left way to stinkin' early. The dancing didn't even start. *sigh*  Mr. Hotness showed up in an Elvis costume. It was SO funny! Gosh, he rocks.  I just want to make something clear, he is not as hot and Sunshine. BUUUUTTT!!! HE SINGS AND LOOOVES TO PLAY THE GEE-TAR! Hhahahah. I htink next time I see him I will have to ask him what kind of guitar he plays. He wants to be a worship pastor. I could go for that. ;)  Gosh, I am a freak.  Laura is very tired and must get her beauty sleep. 11 MORE SHOWS!!!  22 HOURS OF STARING AT HIS FACE! Cha ching.   Happiness.  I don't like him.  I really don't.

           To be a one girl revolution...  Yesterday was a...well...BAD day.  Haha. School was ok. I had a test in math. Yuck. It had these true or false questions that I don't think I did very good at. I went to ASB. It was..ASB. Yeahh. Then I went home and made some noodles. Then I went to CYT. It was quite boring. There was only four people there...all girls. So we just talked and painted our nails, fun but a waste of time.  Then I went to the rehersal. Yuck! I walked around with this girl named Eliza who is an exchange student from Brazil. She is cool. But i REALLLY needed to study because today I am going to FAIL two quizzes in two classes. So I never got to study. I am in a horrible mood.  *sigh*   Today is a bad hair day and a "nothing good about me day"  I woke up at 5:30 then I just did homework all morning so I haven't had time to take a shower or anything. Oh well, it doesn't really matter what I lok like at schoool. Yuck. I am a nervous wreck.   Thank God its the weekend.  Goals for this weekend: Study Spanish Write great expectations character anylis clean room be in contact with Mr. Hotness at the play Don't slack of See sunshine at church  Get closer to God Wrap Matt's present (his birthday is tomorrow!)  I think thats about it..  OOH! wait...this oen is most important... GET BETTER GRADES!!!   Gosh,  hate school.   I hate every little thing about it.   I am such a mess.  I better go study.

Today I woke up and read my bible...then matt and I cleaned the house. (Noticeed I am capitilaized! Mwa haha...) Then I tooka shower and my myself look really gorgeous... Haha. riiggghhhtt.. Anyways.  Then I went to my sisters dress rehersal. HE was there. Lol Lol.  I will not mention any names, considering when Karsen reads this she will torcher me for life.  So I just sat and watched him act. (STORY TIME)  Then he walked of the stage and walked right up to me and goes "Hey! What are you reading?" Then he sits RIGHT next to me. I go "Great Expectations..the stupidest book in the world" then he says "Sounds...uh...stupid?" Hahahhaha. It was quite amusing. Then he just sat by me and watched the rest of the play. *sigh*  :P  THE END!  What a marvelous story!

           Today started out as a bad day. First, I felt absolutely worthless. I don't get the best grades, I am not thta good at sports, I am not the best christian either. So I felt like no one should love me because I am such a horrible person. ALl my sins were weighing me to far down. So I just spent all morning trying to mold myself into  a better person.  It worked...kinda of. I was still so depressed.  Then I get to rowing. First...ther eis this girl on my rowing team. Her name is Andee. She is the nicest girl alive and she was always SUPER happy. I will always remember her smiling! So I get to rowing and Allyson tells me that her mom came to rowing and asked everyone if they knew where she was. She is missing. All her parents could find was her wallet. She is only 17. Now the police and everyone are searching for her. I am so scared. She was such an awesome person.  So that whole thing made me realize how precious life is. I know I will die, that time is not that far away. But in my death I want to change the world.  I don't want to die and have no one remember me. I want people to remember me because I was a christian.   *sigh*  I love my life, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.  peaceroni.

           I always have that question. Am I falling apart from the things I desire and love or do I have my feet on the ground, rock solid. Do I know my goals? do I have the power to achieve these goals? Or are they out of my reach. Will I forever fail to meet the high expectations I and others set for myself? I hope not.  I am one confusing chick.  Today I went to PIANO! Yeah. It was piano.  Hahha. Interesting.  She had smarties in her candy bowl! YUM  At school I just tried to get someone to take me to the Five Iron Frenzy concert. I wanna go SO stinkin' bad. So I told Sara to ask her mom if she could take us. I would seriously pay for her ticket.    Then my mom forced me to go to SPANKIES (kidna like goodwill...) to find a dress for WINTER FORMAL! HAH! I am sooo not getting a 10 dollar dress..I want a 300 dolllar one! So I went with an open mind, "Maybe I will find THE dress here..." But I didn't. Everything smelled and looked like crap. end of story.   Then we went home and I cooked dinner. It was tasty I made this basil garlic sauce and I put it on nooodles. Then I went to hip hop. Now I am home  Ohh!! My mom, brother,  and sister will be gone ALL day EVERYDAY for like a week and a half! Yipppppeee!they have dress rehersals for that play! Te heehehe! I am so sitnkin' glad I am not in it!!! :D  I better be leaving...  Adious luverly amigos!   *The Critic*   P.S. anyone want to take hip-hop? ;)

            Oh my gosh. I just got back from Wendy's. Hahhaha...I had the FUNNIEST idea right before I bought my food. I decided to make my dad order extra pickles with my chicked strips. (He was in the front seat) So he goes "Can I have a chicken strip meal with extra pickles?" and that worker guy goes "We can only give you extra pickles on a burger."  My dad was all like "Please. We really need pickles" The guy goes "Well...if you really need them I guess you could have them" During this whole spectacle my sister and I laughed SOOOO stinkin' hard. We were like dying of laughter. (Can you die from laughing?) It was SOOO much fun. So I got my chicken. And my pickles...  MmmmMmmMmm  Now I am watching a show about CHEESE! *w00t*  I better leave eth the bloggeth.  Love, Laura

            So, I stayed up till like 1 last night and since i am scared of the dark (I know...its weird) I slept in my moms room.  Then I woke up at 11 and found I missed my contact oppoinment so no new colored contacts for me!! Then we went to walmart and I got new glasses.  The lady said my head was so small that I had to shop in the kids department. Hah! I got like fisher price lenses. Its a little sad. :)  Then we went to the mall the return a shirt my mom got my at nordys that was WAY to tight.  It was crazy there!! There were so many beautiful girls there...haha. I mean really, they were. Everything on them was perfect.  Then, there I was with my old jacket and my baggie jeans.  But, I think I felt better then them...They probably had to get up at 4 to make sure everything was perfect! Hah! I woke up at 11 and we left at 11:10 and I still felt pretty. ;)

           By: Brandy Campbell I love Christmastime. But as I sit here in my darkened living room, watching the lights on the tree twinkle, inhaling the scent of cranberries and cinnamon, I wonder if I understand the season I love.   I fear that I am not amazed by the Advent. I’m afraid that I’ve allowed Christmas carols to influence my thinking, when in fact the story of Jesus’ birth cannot adequately be summed up in a few verses sung by a choir.  It’s hard for me to wrap my mind around the miracle of Jesus’ birth—not only the miracle of a virgin bearing a child, more the miracle that God allowed Himself to be born. That He allowed Himself to be bound up by skin and bone and blood.  Jesus left behind the streets of gold and a crystal sea for the dirty roads and muddy rivers of earth. The hands that formed all of creation now clutch the finger of the one who just gave birth to Him. The voice that spoke forth the beginning of time is now reduced to cries and coos. The eyes that saw the past, present and future now struggle to focus. He left the crown for a cradle and a cross. He used to listen to the songs of the angels. Now He listens to the shaky, frightened lullaby of Mary. He left a place we can’t even imagine to go to a place we sometimes wish we could forget.  And what’s amazing is He knew what would happen. He knew the physical pain—Jesus knew that He was leaving a place of no sickness to live in a world festering with it. Jesus came here knowing that He would have skinned knees and blisters, stomachaches and stubbed toes. He knew that ultimately He would face a humiliating death—beaten, stripped naked and suffocated. He felt thorns gouging His forehead. The searing pain of a spear in His side. Rusted nails splintering the bones in His wrists.  I must not forget that Jesus left a place where there were no tears to come here. What was it like the first time He felt hot tears on His cheeks? He was tempted, abandoned by His friends and family, mocked, ridiculed and forsaken. He wept.   Why did He do it? We all know the pat answer: to save us. But couldn’t there have been an easier way? Did He really have to be all human? Couldn’t He have taken away His pain? Couldn’t He have struck dumb those who would mock Him? Paralyze those who would beat Him?   But Jesus chose the path He did, knowing the consequences, knowing the costs, knowing the reward. And it all began at Christmas. In a city crowded with strangers, a young girl knelt on the hard ground, giving birth to the Savior. Did Joseph pace nearby, looking up at the sky, crying out for help, for answers? When Mary held her child in her arms, could she understand the reality of it? When she laid Him at her breast, did she realize she was nourishing her creator?  I don’t think she understood. I don’t think her human mind could wrap itself around the deity in her arms. I know mine can’t. I can only pray that the Christmas season will bring with it more amazement than familiarity.   May we never make the birth of our Lord common.   [Story from RELEVANTmagazine.com]

            So, after the fifth cream puff, I begin to think...why am I eating this trash?  Maybe they will give my temporary satisfaction...   But just make me fat?  I don't wanna be fat.  Everyone lately has been thinking I am anorexic.  Maybe I am...   We went out to eat last night.  All I had was two peices of pita bread.  Everyone in my whole family had these gormet drinks.  I asked for water.  When I told the waiter I was done withmy untouched food so looked at me super funny then said in a forceful way "Are you sure...?"  Yeah, I am sure.  I can't eat.  Then I probably looked even more suspiciour when I excused myself to go to the bathroom after I ate.   Today at christmas dinner I had two olive on my plate and my cousin was like "Got enough food?! I don't want you over eating.. ;) "  And I don't know why, but it made me feel odd and akward.  I felt like everyone was trying to force food down my body.  Then she was like "Not etaing anythign till Florida, eh?"  "I eat."   I think.

            Today I went to my brothers symphony concert...it was interesting. Since I am sick I went into this whole coughing spaz thang. I could not stop coughing. It hurt my throught SO bad, I almost DIED!!  It was interesting. Then I saw Mr. Interesting himself...this punk dude I used to like. Haha. I am quite ashamed. He is a band geeek turned punk. Enough said.   Then we went home and I finished cleaning and the guest started coming.    It was an interesting party..all these scary little kids over so Austin, Alissa, and I hid in the bathroom and played cool. Interesting timmmeees. I lost. :9 Sad...veeerrryy sad.   then we just ate desert and fatty foods. Yummmmmm!!  Austin is soooo coool!! I never ever get to see him anymore because we both go to different churches now :(  he goes to Marc, Eric, and Aarons church. Hah! The poooor soul. I might go to church w/ him sometime, that would be fun in a scary sorta way.  Then we played sardines with all the kids and everyone. I was the person who was supposed to hide and be found so I hid in my brothers closet and I saw my present by accident! Ooops :) I didn't see what it was though, just the bag, so it might not even be mine.  Anywho...we played in the dark so I was sitting in his closet then Carter (Austins little brother) came and he tried to find me. When he was looking in the closet he bent over and his head hit my nose and my nose started BLEEEDING! Yuckkk! I had blood all over me.  We stoped playing.   Then I drank more soda.   Then Lori Ann, Austin, and I went exploring in our addition to our house. It was a little scary in the dark.  Then Matta nd Freddy came and tried to scare us. It didn't work. :)  Well I guess thats it...I am getting sleeeepppy.   I am gonna sleep in SUPER long tomorrow! YIPEE!

            Right now I am watching TVU, its coool.  You know what.  When I was younger I used to be obbsessed with christmas. I would make me list in November and always say "I want this...I want that" I wanted everything.  And I always got what I wanted.   Everything.  Now, the thigns I ask for have gotten bigger and more expensice. I don't get much anymore.  We don't have as much money. Its not like we are poor or anything..  Now, I sleep in on christmas day.  I don't really care for the tree or the lights, or  anything.  I don't really care about God either.  He doesn't seem to matter. Here I am...sitting...at the computer.  Wasting my day away when I could be doing something...  something worthwhile, something that will make a difference.  But I fear I will never make a difference.  I can never change the world.   But I can sure try.

             Hmm...  I need say any of my thoughts any more...   Well, today I am still sick.  I keep coughing up blood, its pretty nasty. I bled all over the carpet, just in time for our christmas party!  Then I had to clean it up and I felt like I was going to faint.  Haha.  I laugh at myself a lot. I don't know why.   When I was younger, whenever I did something wrong (in my own eyes..like eating to many cookies..)  I would hit myself super hard over and over again. I always had horrible headaches and no one could figure out why, but I knew.  I thought I would learn my lessong and never do the thing I hit myself for...but I wouldn't.  So I had to teach myself to stop.  Instead of hurting myself I would force myself to say "Its ok, everyone makes mistakes, next time i wont do it this way."  It was hard to change...the punishment somehow gave me the forgivness I really wanted.  The only way to stop was to search for God. It worked.  God is awesome.   I love him so much, he changed my life.

            I know it sounds kind of like dufus but its a SUE-WHEAT place. Its this little small town in Oregon, only like 600 people.   Lets start at the begining...  Ok, thiws mronign I went on this service trip thang and I was like "Uh..it will  be fun, I think..."  So I arrived at the chruch and I just talked to Shannon and the Duferenens (Hah) starteed to arive... [Big long side note.....in the summer we went on a service trip there but I didn't go. They served all these people. ETc....Etc..]  So I was like they are..interesting.  So we all went on the bus and went to Portland where we packed clothes 'n such into these boxes.  It was funnn!!  We foudn a pair of dirty unndeeerrwears! :o    So it was fun and I met all these AWESOME dufor people!!! Like this awesome cowboy who had a big belt buckle, boots, and a cowboy hat. his name was THAD!!! Isn't that the coolest thing you have ever heard? He was pretty hot to.  All the girls were like "THHAAAAAD!! we lovvvee Thad!" He farms sheep! Then we went to steakburger and ate. My awesome friend SARAH (I LOVE YOU! E-mail me!)  ate with me. Keary and Sarah's twin (who I forget his name..) Ate with us at our table too..   So this was pretty odd...  Sarah's twin and I both got the same thing... He was like I got a burger but I really wnated to cheese but I had to pay 40 cents, but I got it anyways... And i was like "me to...hmm"  Then we started talking about tarter sauce and he was like "I loooooove tarter sauce!" and I was liek "me too...  Then, the person comes with our drinks and we both had the SAME THING! A blackberry milkshake! :O It was like crazy dude :)  Then Keary and Sraah went off and this whole "You were meant to be together" thang. I was like oh geeez...save me!  Hahahha He was prety coolie though.   Then the service day was over and I had to go to voice, in case you didn't know I have been super sick so I couldn't really talk, never the less sing.  So we just sight read the whole thing wich was booooorrrrringg. Then we went to church and I saw the DUFOR people again! YIPPEEE!! They are so sitnkin' cool. They make me mucho happys.  Then we had to go to portland to get a c-mas present. I was my dress at that cool store again! :)  Then we went to churchy again and I saw the DUFOR people!!! YIPEE!!   I love them! They are all farmers and they are sue-wheat. They were all soooo nice to me, thats why I love them.  I guess thats al.  Peace out my man. (or men?)   Laura  AKA.   DUFOR LOVER!  Keary and I am moving there.

            Hi everyone! Yup. I am. Thats it.  This week i..... Monday: Went to my last piano lesson till 2004!! Tuesday: Went to a church thing then my grandmas super fun (and tasty...) christmas party. These two guys kept stalking me around. At first I thought they were hot but then I changed my mind.  Then we went to LOTR. GOOOD movie!   Wednesday:Babysitted this crazy 3 year old then guitar lesson.  Thursday:NOTHING! :) Friday: Went caroling w/ CYT.   Yup thats the end.   Just a side note...  If you want to know where I was for  2 wekk, I got in trouble thats all.  I just want to say thanks to people like Shannon who just said "Oh, you got in trouble. Thats no fun!"  Then didn't ask any questions..but it bothered me when people would be all like "Oh my gosh, Laura, your such a horrible person, what did you do?!"  It doesn't matter what I do, its what I do about what I did. Does that make sense? Well, I am changed...I wont ever do that again.

            Last night I went to this glassblowing thing and it was kind of intertaining.  These guys who were caroling were scary. Haha  yeah...it ws interesting.  So then when I got home I was like "mom, can you help me study spanish?" and she just BLEW UP She was like "You haven't studied yet?!" and I was like "Well, I know the meats and I studied these in the car" btu I guess she didn't hear me and she yelled and yelled.  She wsa like Doug, what should she do with her? Do you think no computer till monday is fair?  a dn I was like "NOOOOO" but I didn't say that...but then my dad goes "sounds good to me." Then my mom was like we might as well study these!  So I was like okkaayy.  So we studied but she left the book open so I could see all the answers and it made me lok like i knew everything.  So I went to bed then my dad came and he was like "We decided, since youknew all the spanish words, you can use the computer."   But I really don't.   I told my mom yesterday that the meats wont be on the quiz.  But they are.  Now I am a liar and a cheater.

            Why do I have such a perfect life? Nothing ever goes wrong with me.  All my friends have all these stories about parents leaving them and not seeming to care and great tradgedies.  I have nothing like that. Two perfect parents.  3 perfect siblings, we never fight or yell. I have a nice (*cough*) house and lots of friends. We have kind neighbors who always bring us tasty cookies. I am as popluar as I want to be at school and my grades are good. I can afford to get clothes I like, whenever I want.   I have everything I could ever want. I have God.   But still, I am never ever satisfied. I often find myself depressed and trying to find my place in this world.  Why?  I love my place.  But I always want more.  I never think I am good enough for God, or even the wonderful friends I have.   Am I forever falling? Or do I have a place. A time.    A purpose.   I have read all these stories about people like Rachel Scott who lived whole heartedly for God, never turned back.   I want to do this.  I want to be like these people.  I want to be everything for God.  But I feel I shall never be perfect.  I am quick to anger, slow to love.  I judge people by there looks.  I scorn those who win my distrust.  I try to make my enemys weak so they finally break.  I feel this will finally make me better than them.  I will finally be popular and loved by everyone.  but really, people will never think that.  I have no intenntions for people to look at me and say "Wow, she is gorgeous, I bet she is really popular."  I want, no, I need people to look at me and say "Wow, she is amazing, she is living totally for God."  But, it is so hard.  I try with all my  heart to reach out and be a friend to the lonely.  But I don't want them to bring my social standings down. I will say hi to them in the hallways but I wont be a really friend.   I wont call them on the phone, invite them over, or even invite them to sit with me at lunch.  No, why would I want to do that? It might hurt me in the long run, I might lose friends.  But really, I have nothing to fear.  When giving up my friends for the less loved and unpopular I am gaining the   BEST  friend   Of ALL   God.    Don't Stare. Don't Judge.   Laura

            Hi!!   Right now I am updating my blog. I have been thinking... and...  CHRISTMAS IS COMING TO TOWN!!!  Yeah baby.  I love it.  I went to van mall today. annnddd I saw the BEST SANTA EVER!!  I got my picture taked with him like 5 years ago. He is sue-wheat. I bet he gets paid a lot. He has a REAL beard instead of all those fakers.  He is also really friendly, I wish he was my grandpa.  That would rock if my grandpa was  a mall santa! :D  I would be super happy!  I would sit on his lap and tell him everything I wanted.  :D  I would like to take this moment to thank Shannon for her wonderful blog post. And because I loved it soooo much I want to post it here for allmy friends to see. (I hope its ok with you Shannon!)  Here is Shannon....  Everyday at 8 minutes after 2 the big orangish-yellowish bus pulls out from my school. Bus # 52 that carries all of us students back to our homes to change into our pajamas and put on our slippers. I know where each person gets off and when we will stop next. At the fourth stop we end up at a little rickety house right off of St.Johns. A brown torn up house that I am assuming a very happy old couple lives in. The yard isnt done and the lawn isnt mowed...There is a huge overgrown tree covering the house that I am sure screams loudly during windy storms. But amongst all of the clutter and behind all of the mess...there is still, even in the first week of December, a tiny pink flower peeking our from beneath the corner of the fence. And everyday when we get to that stop there is a little soft golden retriver puppy head poking out from the top of the fence. Huffing the air and watching as the bus begins to roll away. Everyday, no matter how cold or lonely...warm and happy..no matter the mood or the people I am thinking about....I can always count on that puppy to be there to make me smile. I can always count on him to be there...even if there isnt anything else to count on   I LOVE THAT!  You rock Shannon.

            HI EVERYONE!!  today I cleaned the hosue iwht my brother, Matt, it was interesting. I felt soo sick but I couldn't tell anyone because last night I watched Miss Congeniailty on NBC (or was it CBS?)  till 11 last night so my mom siad if I complained at all she wouldn't take me to the mall.  I almost fainted when I was cleaning. But it happens a lot so it wasn't as scary as the first time.  My vision gets all black then I just like colapse. Not fun.   Right when I was done cleaning my mom took me to the mall and I got 2 jackets! YIPEEE! They are sooo awesome!  I got 'em at nordstrom. One is a velvet blazer (It looks kinda like yours Heather, is it ok? :) )  it loks almost exactly like the cool one I almost bought from Delias btu its cheaper. Then I got this puffy white coat tthat  makes me look like a MARSHMALLOW! Its soo stinkin' cool.  I was all like "WHOA!! I look huge!!" And my mom thinks I am anorecix because I didn't eat lunch or breakfast today because I didn't ahve any time and she was like "NOTHING YOU WEAR WILL MAKE YOU LOOK HUGE!!" so I was like ....whoa...ok... :)  Then we got my sister some clothes for christmas at Buckle and Aeropostale. They are super cool! I want them for myself!   Then we went to my guitar lesson. I saw this cool girl named Jenifer there, she is taking voice.  Guitar is rreally fun. I LOVE it!!! :D   Well, I guess thats all!   BYE!  Laura

           Broken Heart By: Falling Up  In this moment synchronized inside, words that paint a legacy of life A different picture will unfold, a healing finds it's way through Sifted times I take another breath, with an ambience of nothing left So heal my heart rain down your love these waters bring me back to life  Chorus Father, healer deliver me from broken love Stay hear, closer let me hear your voice of love  There's a healing calling from the wind, there's a healer waiting to begin In timeless places, traced and faceless will I learn to let go Take me to the heights where love controls, far away from home but feels so close This empty heart of mine will fall inside and bring me back to life  You can hold, you can mend You can heal, you can brake I hold cause something etched this way  Chorus Father, healer deliver me form broken love Stay hear, closer let me hear your voice of love Savior, Redeemer bring me to this place of peace Jesus, garden my broken heart is so in need

            I decided that I kmust blog, or else I will just keep my feelinggs bottled up inside my small frame and eventually I will burst.  See, today was really depresing. I don't know why. It was just one of those days when I felt ugly. I can't hide behind my mask anymore.  I seemed to have been hiding behind it for too long. Everyone thinks I am this happy person with a perfect life.  Its time to face the facts.   I'm not.   First of all-  I am not happy.  I know I really should be, I have been gifted with many wonderful things.  But i'm not.   Even my voice teacher noticed my mask being missed.  He was like "Are you doing okay? Are you having a bad day?"  Every day is a bad day in this living hell.  I wish I had someone I could really talk to.  Someone at school who would know my true feelings.  Someone I wouldn't be afraid to tell everything.  I wish there was someone at church.  Someone who really liked me.   When I go to church I just feel like everyones fake. They try to plaster a smile on and pretend they are happy to see me and ask me how I am. "Good!" I quickly reply with my fake grin.  But I am not good.  Today was a crying day.  I feel like I don't fit in, anywhere.  I am to ugly.  To boring.  Not smart enough.  I don't have the right clothes.  Even my hair always looks dumb.   But if I could, if I only would focus on God more all those things would just fade away because they really- and truly,  DON'T MATTER!

Then she married this perfect guy and everything was just great.  Then, today he broke into there own house with his new girlfriend and was threatening Mia and he says he want a divorice.

           You, my friend are a true individual. You most likely hate trends and are creative. By seeing things differently, people either admire you or think you are a bit strange. I'm guessing you are a lot like me. Perhaps a Good Charlotte hater? I hope so. An inspiration to us all, continue being you! (If you like GC, I'm sorry, I am just expressing an opinion)

           earlier today I was running around my neighborhood and suddenly I just kind of stopped. And there, to my left was a beautiful pasture. It was almost as long as the eyes could see. It was coever by a dense hazy fog lightly covereing the green grass. Too my left was a forest of gigantic old growth trees. I just leaned against the fence slowly taking in the beautfiul moment then suddenly a song started playing. First it went through my headphones then all the way too my heart.    "I'm all alone there's no one for me to live for.  Letting go of the thigns i've always clung to,  thats when i'm glad that I belong to you."    Suddenly, it all made sense.    Why I am here.    It was a beautiful moment.    Tears slowly graced down my face.    I paused my cd and just stood there.    In awesome wonderment.    Then, quickly yet smoothly, words started pouring out my mouth,    "I love you Lord, and I lift my voice to worship you, oh my soul rejoyce. Take all of me..."      ...

           Hi everyone!  I must makea  formal apology for not blogging for so long.  Yup. Haha  well, I am boycotting the internet..well not really boycotting it, just using it very little.   You see, I am always addicted to the internet and when  i am always using it I become I lazy head and I find that I start to ignore God. Which is BAD!  So on tuesday at youth group I kinda woke up and I was like "Wow...I am  a jerk. I always say I am so busy..and I never find time for God or even homework but I am on the internet  all day."  So I am quiting the internet and every waking moment is for God.

           Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. 10For,     "Whoever would love life         and see good days     must keep his tongue from evil         and his lips from deceitful speech.      11He must turn from evil and do good;         he must seek peace and pursue it.      12For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous         and his ears are attentive to their prayer,     but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil." 13Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?14But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear ; do not be frightened." 15But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, 16keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. 17It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. 18For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit

           I was reading  a message board post about how this girl had s e x (sorry, sara's computer wont let her go to my blog if it is typed normally:P ) before she was married.  She was like "well, first I got drunk! It made it so much better!"    She was 14.  My heart snapped.  Broke in half.  I just started to cry. The tears quickly streams down my shaking face. This is an epidemic.  A bad one.  As I sit here I just cry.  I wish I could help these people, but I can't.  I wish there was something, anything i could do.  So I might as well make YOU a good person and give you the big lecture.   First, s ex before marrige is absolutely wrong. Why?  First, it says in the bible. And, do you want to make a commitment like this? Your just giving your heart away, sure it will give you a little temporary happiness but then its gone and your broke again.  So, ( i know..I shortened it. A lot.)  Anywho, I have a quiz for YOU!  Are you ready for se x?  Question one:  Are you married?  If you answered no, your not ready!!  Bingo.  Thats it!  Remember: everything your doing now is preparing you for eventual marrige, so please, save it for marrige!

Then, he goes "Laaauuurrraaa, I can I wear your mittens?" an di was like "Um...okayy." So he was like, I was just joking!! Pink doesn't look good on me... There movie was interesting.  They did the three little pigs. But, at the end aaron played a switchfoot song so I was happyyyy!  EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! They are playing the BARLOW GIRL SONG ON THE RADIO!!!!

           Today I checked my e-mail and I got this  message from MSN telling me to delete some messages or my account would freeze up. So, I tried to delete the MSN message but, it wouldn't let  me.  Stuff like this seems to happen in my life to. There are things I do that I can t seem to arise, really stupid things. Like stupid thigns I did way back in the seventh grade, or even the third grade. God keep stelling me to erase them and move on but i can never seem to let them go, make them leave, forever.   Today I woke up at 4 am, my nose bleeding, again. It bled for about an hour. While I was waiting in the dark for it to stop I heard loud crashing noises. The tree were colapsing under the snow and ices great weight. It was an eerie sound. First a snap then the whole branch, or even large tree, would come swishing down to the ground, its leaves muffling the loud sound that could have been caused by its great weight. It seems like snow used to be, well snow. Something that would maybe come once a year and would be gone the very next day. This is worse than just snow. It was been here for a week now ice, inches thick, covers all the snow making it nearly impossible to drive, or even walk on the snow.  Its amazing that something so light and fluffy could cause our whole city to stop for days!  even the mall is closed.  I better go eat something then I am going to clean our house...

            this one was- am i drama queen!!  "Behind the Scenes"   Nobody will ever catch you trying out for the lead in the school play. Nor will they ever find you spreading gossip, retelling wild adventure stories or calling attention to yourself. Drama Queen? Not a chance! You're secure enough with yourself, but feel most comfortable blending in with the crowd. If things don't go your way, you shrug it off and hope for better luck next time. Unfortunately, while this attitude works most of the time with ease and grace, your easygoing style may occasionally backfire if you fail to stick up for yourself when the situation calls for it. A little drama never hurt anyone, especially if you end up getting what you want in the end.

           What is love? What is the difference between “I love God,” and “I love my dog Rufus,” or “I love the Ramones?” Is love the one common denominator of diamonds, Hallmark cards and child safety seats? What is love? How might a person such as me find it? How can I give it?  What about romantic love? Is this the best example of love to be found? I’m not so sure. Philip Yancey points out that in America—a place where romantic love is king of all things social, emotional and commercial—the divorce rate is much higher than in countries where arranged marriages are the norm. In America, we choose our spouses based on feelings of love; why do these feelings change? It seems that romantic love is often predicated upon the maintenance of a certain weight or a full head of hair.  Okay, maybe romantic feelings are not really love at all. What about love between parents and children? The love of a child is certainly a precious gift (although I’ve had children tell me they love me immediately before professing similar feelings for a coffee table). Equally valuable is the love passed from the hearts of parents to their children. My mother has loved me more than any other human being. Once, she went out of town for a week and left me her car key so that I could use her car; she even filled the gas tank for my added comfort.   And yet, somehow, even with people in my life who obviously love me, I still, like so many people, lay my head on my pillow some nights and wonder if anybody really loves me or if anybody ever will. On nights like these, I wonder if love is not some intangible thing given in vain, if it is not just a vapor that eludes our outstretched fingers.  As if my inability to grasp love did not irritate me enough, giving love is much worse! On every page of my Day Runner appear things like, “Ask Sam how he’s doing in his biology class,” and, “Buy housewarming gift for Ranae,” because I am incapable of remembering on my own the needs of the people around me. And if I make no effort at all to do something about the needs around me, I will invariably become sucked into the vortex of my own little world and my tiny problems—i.e., I never feel as close to God as I would like to, I have to replace various parts of my car as often as I cut my hair, and I have pointy toes, like crayons. Much to my dismay, I have to make an effort to find out about and love others. My heart is so easily rendered of steel, or at least of Teflon.  Why am I so selfish? Why do pictures of fly-covered Afghan children set my eyes watering and my hands reaching through my purse for my checkbook, while I have to force myself to show love for my comfy, well-fed American friends and family? Does this mean that suffering is a prerequisite for love? Great, so in order to be loved, a person has to maintain physical standards of beauty for romantic love or endure some terrible suffering? Forget love, then—it’s just like everything else in the world: too costly and yet too cheap.  All these musings are, of course, silly. Somehow I don’t think true love is necessarily found in a bowl of popcorn between a guy and a girl at the movies, or that a person cannot merit love without intense beauty or intense suffering. I think love is found in the slowing heart between the outstretched arms of a beaten man on a cross and requires nothing but desperation.   God used a strange mix of physical, temporal things to show love—splintered beams, nails, 40-minus-one, hypovolemic shock. This was real love on earth; as Bonhoeffer puts it, “This love of God does not withdraw from reality into noble souls detached from the world, but experiences and suffers the reality of the world in the harshest possible fashion.” In time and space, God made a way for his love to be “poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit” so that we can “know and rely on the love that God has for us.” The cross is a real-space, real-time pillar to which I am tethered, an anchor that gives me the thing I’m looking for but can’t seem to find anywhere else: security.   For some reason, it’s sometimes hard for me to experience love. But somewhere in history God has proven His love for me in a way that transcends my questions and experience. My quest for love—at times quietly heartbreaking—can be over, so long as I’m willing to rest my knees in the mud beneath the cross.

This guy who is  a CYT parent owns a haircutting place bye esther short park and this girl was like "can you cut my hair to make it match with the era?" So he was like "Sure!!!!" So she got a bob then this other girl was like "Cut mine tooo!" It went on ;) It was SO coool! Haha.  so then we went home and I changed and then we went to church. So Matt and I went to the servcie together and he was like  "Lets sit over there." So I looked over there and I was like "Holy smack" The twins were sitting right there. AH!!!   So I was like..how about we sit in the far corner? So he was like okay whatever.  So the whole time I waas like oh my goodness, what are they doing here?   Haha.  So I talked to them afterwards and they said they were visiting our church to decide if they wanted to go here (or is it there?) and how they have a soccer game in seattle tomorrow. So I was like "Oh...interesting.." tehn I ran away to hang out with my cooler friends ;)  The end.

            Dude, my sister just made me turn off Switchfoot. dude, what a suck fest. Dude, this has been a fillin w/ shilling kinda day, if ya know what  I am talking fo.   Okayyy.  Well, let me put it this way.  I am going to break my day into different parts rating each part ona scale of 1-10 (10 best.)  Morning: 3, I turned off my alarm clock in my sleep so I had to take a shower late which then resulted in: A.Matt being mad B. Hannah being mad C. Being late for being early. English: 4, got in trouble had to be moved by danielle (he is a guy..i think I spelled that wrong) But its okay cuz we just talk about guitars and switchfoot the whole time. Poster dude, about a stinking word. And you know what word I got? Succumb!!! Hahha Science: 2 Way to much homework for my own good. Spanish: 5.7 Forgot to do my homework. But then I read Inge's YM magazine and got to make fun of "hot" guys for the rest of the period. *coughhh* CHAD MICHAEL MURRY! "Hillary duff and I are just friends!!" WA History: 4 I finished my project but I had to stay after to fix somethings with the printer then resulting in being late for lunch. LUNCH! 9.5 That was SOOOO much fun. I have NEVER laughed that hard in my whole life. Hahahah. Sara, Caitling, Taloy- you know why ;) Then that pretending to be fairies in the b-room. Hahha Math: 3 Yuck tastic. yeah...but I got to look at beau's guitar magazine and it had the music for Meant to live!!!!! (s-foot)  (home..) 8,So I was gonna buy that magazine at voice lessons but the teacher called and was like "I can't do your lesson today" So I was like YAYYYY so I went on amazon and bought the book that has ALL the beautiful letdown songs for guitar on it! YIPEE! 3-7 days ;) I don't think I can wait that long.  CYT: 3 it was bad. So I am in this improv callss and you kind of have to be funny, but I wasn't funny. I suciked so bad. It was horrible horrible horiblle. I kept messing everything up. :(  Piano: -2 WORSE! I have to have this song memorized and because I am stupid I didn't memorize it so she yelled. High point: I get to quit at the end of MARCH! EE!! Now I  can just play guitar all night and day! Whoopee!  Home: My sister made me turn off switchfoot!! :(

            Stamp.  So, today was an awesomley cool day, until the end. So first we went to bellevue and went shopping. I got some lip and face junk from sephora but thats all. All the puma hsoes were wayyyyy to expensive.  Then we went to Ikea.  Man, thats a crazy store. I got a framed photograph of this bridge, lake, and mountain thing. It so pretty and peaceful.  Then I got a bunch of frames for these cool cards I got at the glass museum. they have awesome quotes on them. My favorite is "Do one thing everyday that scares you." Elanor Rooseavelt said that! She is one cool lady.   Then I got two prety candles. My mom wont let me light them in my room but they are still cool.   My new room is gonna be awesome.   See, on one half its gonna be like crazy guitar rock-ish. Then we have these windows that are currently in our dining room and they are from about 1890 and they are pretty thin and everything so I am going to get three of them and hang them from the ceiling and that will be the transformation to a place of sitll tranquility, or as I call it, my "Misty Haven" :)  I am so excited.   So, after Ikea we were driving home and we get this call and my grandfather was back in surgery and now he is in the ICU.  I doubt any of you know but about a week or too he had a small heart attack so he had to have a triple bypass surgery to get his heart all cleared up. So we has doing fine then he started to feel a bunch of pain so he went back to the doctors and we had a really had infection from the surgery and he had like a "super bug" or something.   SO, thats what my life has been filled with.  He has had baout three surgerys all lasting more than 5 hours.  Not fun.  So now he is totally unconcious.  If he dies it will be absolutely unbearable.   See, this happened to my Grandma two years ago and her brian had so much damage that she can't think right. Not to add any humor to this situation, but she is a lot like Dory from finding nemo.  So if my grandpa dies I don't know who will take care of her.  :(

            Hi everyone!!! Right now I am in Seattle at our hotel. They have free internet!!! Today we went to this aweesome museum in Tacoma. It was a gladd museum but it had mroe than just glass. They had this awwweesome photography section where they gave you rice paper, caligraphy pens, and a clip board and you wrote poetry about how you felt about the art!! It was SO fun! I wrote much much poetry. Then they had this art place where you dre what you felt and everything. I am going to frame my art,i t turned out very good.  Then we took the ferry to downtown seattle and did about an hour of shopping. I got this cool balck and whie striped sweater thing and LIME green shiny purse at nordstrom!!! They are soo coool! Then we went to urban outfitters and I tried ona bunch of very cool clothes that all made me look hot but then I realized that they were playing a really horrible song in the back ground it went something like "I don't care about your personality, I just wanna *edited* you." it was sick so I decided I would psend my money else where, even though the clothes were nice, I can't support crap like that.   Tomorrow we are going shopping more then to my cousin, Chrystals apartment.  I think thats all... who knows!  The pizza guy is coming soon so I better jet!  Later days.... Laura

The concert was pretty good but mosh pit=bad! :)   One quote, the quote of ALL quotes.  Okay, this girl who ran the merch with me gave tricia some cookies and a picture her little sister drew of trish and tricia was like "Man...this will probably be the only valentine i get because all the boys in the band want a valentine from a barlow girl, not a brock girl."  Hahhahaha  I love her.   She hugged me and I am her little sister, so she says :) I love Tricia and Melissa to death.  I didn't get to talk to Mel as much becasue I was running the booth the whole time :/   But, they gave me a free shirt so its all goood.   Yeah. :)

            Hey everyone!  Tonight I went to church and it was loads of fun.  Then afterwards we went to target. So we were driving along and finally the big target is in sight. YIPPE! then my sister was like "Oh no! I left my purse at church!" So we had to turn around and drive alll the way back!  Finally, we arrived at Target.  First I went to the clothes and got a bunch of clothes to try on. They were all cool pant suits and stuff.  So I was in the dressing room and I trid on a really really cute button up shirt and black blazer.  It looked realy good on me but while I was standing there looking at myself in the mirror I started thinking.  I look totally fake.  I don't really wear make-up but there in my suit top I realized I was just trying to fit in...I was trying to be like Lauren.  Not that Lauren is bad or anything.  But all my life I have always wanted to be included.  When I was younger I never had many friends so when I went to school I seriously told myself that I was going to be the msot popular girl in school no matter what.  But it never came to be.  I tried and tried, but never even a moment of popularity came.  But now, I quit   I am never going to be popular so I might as well quit trying!! :)   Anyways, I went to the underwear asile and foudn the cutest underweare on the face of this earth.  They are hello kitty!  Well, I had to buy them because nothing makes my day like quite underwear. And legally I can by them because no one can see them so I am not tryin got fit in with my udnerwear type.   What a great day.

            Psalms 40:1-3 I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and HEARD MY CRY.  He also brought me up out of a HORIBBLE PIT, out of the miry clay and SET MY FEET UPON A ROCK, and established my steps. He hath put a new song in my mouth-praise to our God; many will see it and fear and will trust in the Lord!   How powerful that is.  Here I am crushed under the weight of the earth.  God saw me and he picked up the great weight of all the burdens that have ever afflicted me.  He carried me in the palm of his gentle hand slowly telling me that everything would be okay. Then he "Set my feet upon a rock!" A solid rock, ablissful heaven compared to life before. Now I fall into God even more then ever before. There is a new theme song for my life and its OVERFLOWING with Praise for GOD!

            Well, it all started friday. It was a rush. I went to practice and we tried on costumes. Then I went to my friends house. But I didn't really have fun. We aren't really even friends. (remember...i don't have real friends..)  On saturday we went to rehersal. It was awful.  I was so tired from the night before I couldn't do anything.  Then voice.  Thank god for voice.  for some reason I "stopped singing like Britney Spears and started to sound like an angel" It was kind of nice. But considering I was sick from a reaction frmo my shot and I had a really bad headache...I was in bad mood. Suddenly I started to feel really sick and my face got really red.  Thats when my mask disapeired. I could no longer hide behind my canvas smile.  My teacher was like, "Are you okay? Are you having abad week? Trouble with friends?"  right on the dot.  How do people figure out my life like that? Ha.  I will update more later.

           I watched the half time show, the worst on ever. It does respresent american society verry nicely.  I mean really, Justin Timberlake and Miss Jackson freak dancing on tv was...well...AMERICA!!  American is just searching everywhere for love. Sadly enough- most find it in the opposite gender.  They think they can finally complete there life so they will do anything to get a boyfriend/girl friend.   Some find it in popularity.    They think that if there the hottest girl, with the trendiest clothes that finally they will be happy.   To put it lightly, all of that is crap.  Crappity crap.   Beileve that GOD is the only source of ULTIMATE love in this universe.  Grasp his love, take a hold of his mercy.   I am completely positive your life will be a heck of a  lot better.

            Today was a totally weirdo mixed up day!! Geez. Crazy.  Lunch was HILARIOUS! I couldn't stop laughing. I could barley eat my pizza :)  Mandy.....hahahahahha... That was SO stinking funny. Oh my goodness.  I was like HI mandy!! How are you? then everyone at my table talked way to loud..then just as a joke I was like "Emily, go give the phone to Aaron." Hahhahahahahhahahahahah  Oh, BTW, Mandy, Marc wants to know if your hot and Evan wanst to meet you ;)  Oh, and Lauren wants to know if your rich but why would that matter?!   Then tennis was pretty fun.  Until I started playing. I had to play like the top JV player and they were SO good. but the problem was, I knew I oculd beat them. Its just I would just not pay attention and the ball would zoom by my face.  So it was i think 7-6 (us winning) an di like started to have like an emotional breakdown right on the court. It wasn't like I was crying or anything, but inside I was totally bursting into tears.  It didn't make sense. I am positive God wants me to be on this team. But, its seems that if he wanted me to do this I would acctually WIN some and do good (its for him, isn't it?)  So I was immensly fruesterated.  Maybe being at the bottom of the ladder was getting to me.  Never winning a game was getting to me?  Maybe it was a person at school who would always rub my faults on the court in my face?  Maybe it was me?  So, back to my story.  So I just cryed out to him,  "god, if your here, which I know you are, hep me...HELP  ME"  And he did :)  We ended up winning by one point (which I made)  Which was a huge burden off my chest. But still...  "Why am I on this team, papa? I thought I was going to help spread your word around? But I haven't foudn the right person.."  Papa God just simple responded,  "Wait."  On the way home in the bus I overheard a conversation beetween a few girls. This one girl was saying how she was an atheist because she hated religion and she wanted proof god exist.  God was like shouting at me "Here she is, Laura!!!!!! I placed her in your life at THIS moment, do something!"  See, all day I had been thinking about what she had been thinking about...it was kinda eeire.   So I just sat by her an di was like "why do you beileve what you beileve?" And she was like "I need proof! I need solid evidence. Also, my friends have been shoving religion in m y face and I don't want to just go to some rreligion, I want a realtionship!"  I was liek YES! So I said..  "I absolutely beileve God is NOT a God of religion he is a God of realtionship, He wanst to have a realtionship. He wants to be your buddy. But, they rest, the proof is the hardest part. For that you just gotta have faith."  By then we were at the locker room so I siad "Bye, talk to you later!"  2 points for the tall one.

            Dude! My teeth are like falling apart. Its sick. A big peice of my tooth just came out. Waaa.. I have to go to the orthdontist right after spring break! *yuck*   BUT!   I'm getting my hair CUT!   After spring break though.   I am going to donate it! wahhoo!!!   I was gonnna do it tomorrow but we have a game at MARK MORRIS which is like an hour away, longer by bus so we are going to be gone till 8:30. Which really stinks because I can't go to church!! Which is mundo depressing. Church rocks.    SPEAKING OF CHURCH AND GOD RELATED ACTIVITIES...    Oh! random, my grandpa is giving me spending money for Cali! Gosh, my grandpa rocks!   BACK ON TOPIC!   I might get to go to creation afterall!!!   SEE!   I am going to pay Jacob to take me. And, I am going to pay for everything (food, gas, tickets, camping) PLUS pay him 20 dollars a day for taking care of me ;) Which will make a MAJOR dent (-$400) in my savings account but it will ALLLLLL be worth it!   Creation is the best thing on EARTh.   I just have on dilema...superchick and falling up are playing at the same time on different stages! Oh dear. I might not go to superchick then hang with them afterwards or vise versa. I LOVE CREATION! S-foots gonna be there tooo!!   But they got booted up to the night set which means they wont sign autographs. Waa.. *To much for me to handle*   BUT!   Creation is still the best thing EVER.   Speaking of best things.   MANDY!   I GOT YOUR LETTER!   That sticker is creeptastic...i think i'm gonna put it on my binder to ward of the evil forces of ZANE!   :)    Speaking of EVIL FORCES    Miss Saul was in a BAD mood when she made the science seating chart. Geez. The closest friend by me is Katie and she is farrr away and obviously daniel preoccupies her time ;-) I am by Eric. Which really isn't that bad considering Zane is FARRRRRRR AWAY!!!! Wahho! No creepy stares, baby!   But still, this whole situation scares me. A lot.   See, Zane is hurting so much and I desperatley want to help him but if I start being realy nice to him he might think I like him or somethign and when I tell him I don't like him or if he starts to follow me everywhere he might like r ape me or like murder me or something.   Which he is fully capable of doing.   That my friends is what SCARES me.   Every day it always enters my ming, and I serisouly don't feel safe at all at school.   And it seems as if my friedns don't take this serious, but it IS serious.   Gosh, this is compromising my values.   I want to be a loving christian but its SO hard for me to show love to this guy who stalks me everywhere.   But that I hate the MOST is the STARES it feels like he can r ape me without even thouching me.   Okay, enough about this.   Yuck.   Why did i get on THIS topic!  UGH!   Its runing my life. :)

           Hey everyone!  Today has just been..well..a day. Thank God for everyday. every breath I ever take.  At church, this may seme kinda odd, but I guess I came back to God. See, I have always had this little superiority thing. I always seem to think I am better than everyone. I know even know why, becasue i'm not. But God was just like Laura, your not better than anyone. You make all these mistakes.  But I still love you. I ALWAYS will love you.  And because of that love I am here today.  See, if it wasn't for God I would probably have a horrible life right now. As a child, I always wanted to make MYSELF happy. If any of you were my friends back then, I am sorry. I would always brag about my material possesions and try to make all of my friends feel lowly. While I was still singing "Jesus Loves Me" in sunday school, I was also stealing money from my mum so I could buy candy at fred meyers. While I blew out 10 candles on my cake I was convincing my friends that I was fluent in spanish and I was going to be a foreign exchange student. All of this I remember. At my birthdya party I mumbled nonsense and tried to make people think it was spanish for, "I am going to beat you at air hockey!" Which I also did...but I kinda cheated... Kinda.  In the seventh grade, I cheated a lot to.Then I put on my goody goody smile and reported the "bad kids" who cheated on the test to my teacher.    All of this I did while I still muttered the words "I love Jesus."  In the seventh grade I convinced my friiend she was going to hell.  Even though I, myself was also headed that direction.  I have always hid behind this portrait of lies.  But now, its gone.  See, recently I have fallen in love with jesus.  Fallen in love with God.  and I don't seem to think its at all falling.  Its rising Upwards.  To the chalenge.  Because now I will no longer live behind a portrait of lies.  Because, my eternal mask is gone.  let this be known, i'm not perfect, I never will be.  The prodigal son was not perfect. But he ran back to his father and his father forgave him.  The same way with me and jesus.  This has been a year long process but its finally coming together. I kinda like it.   Its a different kind of free.  Now about  Jamica!  I might go there on a mission trip in December! Please pray for me that this is what God wants me to do. Thanks guys.

            I just got back from the concert. It was pretty  fun. I LOVE FALLING UP!! Oh my goodness. Joe is the cutest guy I have EVER layed eyes on. Seriously. He is SO nice to. Very humble. Its kind like ALL the girls at the concert fell in love with him but he didn't care. It wasn't important to him. Sure, he could have any girl he wants but all he wants right now is GOD. And thats why I like him.  Oh, and he uses the same picks in the SAME COLOR as Jon from Switchfoot :)  Now to Tom, he is the nicest person on the earth. He is the other guitarist. He was so kind to me. He was all tlaking ot his friends but he spent time to talk to me. He wanted to know like how I was and what my name was. Then, I saw him later that night and he was like "Bye Laura!!" And I was like, Wow. He remembered my name. The time I needed someone to make me feel important, Tom was there. He made me feel happy....he made me feel like I had worth and that I was important to him. It made smile all over.  Jessy is really nice too!!!  His girlfriend was SO coool. I felt kind sorry for her though, all these girls were stalking Jessy everywhere.   The drummer (I for got his name *waa*) ws SO cool! I got to talk to him for like 10 minutes at the intermission. We talked about signitures. :) He was like "Wow, my signiture is ugly" and I was like "Well, don't you ever practice signing autographs?" And he was like "No.." and I was like "If I ever get famous I am going to practice my autograph a billion times and make it look REALLY cool so people wil remember me by it" and he was like "Wow...thats a good idea" and Jessy was like "Yeah..that is, I should try that!"   Haha. They make me so happy.  Then the turntable guy was nice too, but I didn't get to talk to him for very long. I was being quized by there Bass man to try to learn everyone in the bands names. But, his training obviously didn't work to well *wink*  He was like "Okay, this is *insert turntable mans name here* what does he do?" and I as like "OOh!! i know this one!" then I go he goes *wooogie wooogie* then I didn't the little turrntable sign with by hands. Hahha. Bass man started laughing then he kept going *woogie* *woogie*   Hahha.  What a fun night.  But, the reason I love faling up most of all is because there main focus is GOD!  I should have pictures up on my website by tomorrow.  homepage.mac.com/onegrlrev

           "Just remember, there's so much more to live for than money, or things, or popularity, or nice cars. Some times I get caught up in worrying about money or getting a new amp- since I don't have one, and I just waste all my energy on this stress and concern. And I'm telling you, it's empty and fickle. And no matter how much I ignore God, or try to write my own life, he's always there when I realize my blind eyes."  Joe is SO coool. Thats like my motto.  Today at school was mondo yucky. I didn't like it.  It was NOT FUN!  I was like, GET ME OUT OF HERE!  Then I went to tennis. It was pretty goood.  I made good friends. She told me her life story. It was sue-wheat. I love when people tell me things baout themselves. That may seem weird but everyone is like a closed book with thousands of locks on it.  I just want to know about you. It makes me think that they don't trust me with information about their lives...and that makes me sad.  Tomorrow I ge tot see falling up *yay* I get to meet Joe. Wahhoo!  I am kinda excited. But for now, I want to SLEEP!  Tomorrow I also must feed the poor so I am going to me gone for abit after school so I can't go to tennis. I hope it rains or else I will miss a game which is BAD!  Hmm...  Im trying to think of something somewhat inellegent to say, but alas, nothing smart has come from this lifeform today.  At least my english poster was pretty. And thats really all that counts in life, eh?  Speaking of Eh, my brother is coming back from canada tonight, Yippee!  Yeah. I think I am going to go to bed in like 20 minutes.  Oh! I talied up the scores for our NCAA comp. and Sara and I are tied! Moohaha! :)

            as most of you know I saw switchfoot last night.    It was alright :)  Frist, Ben was like get to the church at 6. So we did. But they werenb't going ot leave until 6:30 so I was like AH! I am going to be in the very back of the chrystal.  So we left and didn't get there till like 7:10. So I was like AH! I can't wait itll I get my lisence. Then I iwll show up 4 hours early for EVERY concert. Grr face. Oh well. So we entered the building. I didn't realize how yucky the chrystal is for concerts. Sure, the floor MAY have springs in it (that Jon wants to do backflips on ;) more about that later..) But, you cant have a good veiw of the stage unless your in the very front row. Karsen, kasey, Sara and I got fairly close to the front btu then Karsen was like "I am tooooooo hot" We we left :( Copeland started to play. Oh my goodness. That lead singer is creeptastic. I took mandy pictures of him JUST FOR YOU MANDY!!  ;)  Then the jealous sound (was that there name? *can't remmeber*) Lead singer: Mandy he is BALD haha. Not atractive. They were okay. Nothing really memorable about them.  Then Swtichfoot Right b4 switchfoot I ditched our group because they were in the back and I got about 5 feet from the stage sdo I was like "Yay!" Switcfhoot was so good! Yeah, I love them.:) It was the drummers birthday so they brought out a birthday cake and ballons and we all sang happy birthday. It was sue-wheat. :) Umm...Switchfoot didn't do anything REALLY memorable. But yeah. It was grand.  I took video with my digital camera. Haha. I was brekaing the rullees. Mwa haha.  After switchfoot our group was like WE HAVE TO GO! So I didn't get to even get a s-foot sticker :( I was so sad. And, switchfoot was going to be out there to chat after a bit. *can't wait till she gets lisence* I am going to bo at the concerts 4 hours early and stay 4 hours late.  I think I will write more when I get back from school.. :)

            Mandy, I thought you didn't like me because you were all like "Fine! I'm leaving." Then you signed off. :(  Today school was quite fun.  I wish I could be in Sara's class.  i think that Sara is like my closest friend at school and I am not in any of her classes!  Today lunch was AWESOME!  Sara and I went outsidde and just sat in the grass. Then we layed on the grass and stared at the clouds. It was awesome.  We decided to be hippies. I need to find TONS of flowy dresses. They had sue-wheat ones at target for fairly cheap.. :)   Hippies rock.  Then I went to tennis. I am doing so much better!! I'm quite proud of myself. :)  Then!  I got home and I had TWOOOOOOOO packages!!  Tee hehehehe.  One was from Superchick.  Aww :) They said they were sorry about how at the concert I was supposed to have a neet and greet but we didn't. But it was fine by me because I got to work merch which was FUN!  So they sent me an autographed photo. Which is pretty cool, even though I have TONS of there autographs already :)  My second package was my FREE pretty lip gloss from Lucky Magazine! Yipee!  Its quite gorgeous.  Then they also gave me a bunch of face stuff samples.  yay.  What  a beautiful day.

Then seniors will never place there prefectly clean shoes on a shiny championship court ever again.  Gerald Fitch will never play in the NCAA again.  The whole season.  Over.  One point.  One dream, shattered.   Gosh, this is depressing.

            Hello.  Today at tennis we had a match but no one told me. Hahha. So I was like okayyy.  I hate talkign about my life and all the meloncaly things I do.   It seems like allthe attention is always on me...scary.  Thats why when my brother drives us to school I just sit in the car until 8:05 then slowly walk in. I love my quite times in the car.  Its just me, my CD, my journal, and God.  Sheer bliss.  I love it.  EVERYONE should have quite times.     Today I was being a freak at the airport and I was pretending I was the star of a musical and I was singing and dancing and I ran into this pooor lady. Hhahaha. It was SOOO funny. I laughed my head off.  Did I tell you about my newest obsession? His name is Joe. he is 17 and he is in Falling Up. I am goign to see him in concert very soon and we will instantly become wonderful friends and talk on the phone a lot. Then we will part ways but I will meet him at a concert during college and we will fall madly into pure godly love.  How wonderful.  Well, Joe has puma shoes which are an automatic 10 bonus point before we even met. I can't wait.   Since Jon Foreman is 26 and is married Joe is the next best thing. And me oh my is he the best :)  Well, maybe not as good as acertain junior but..never mind. I am digging myself into a deep hole  *jumps out of hole*  Much better.  Gosh, I am SOOO thirrsty. *Dying*  Brb  Okay, i got my yummy purified water.  Dude, I was at my grandpas house last night and I got some water and it had this junk floating in it! It was SICK. I hate any water that isn't purrified. I'm weird like that. :)  I need to think of somethign to do at the falling up concert to make sure Joe remembers me. I think iw ill try to be less of a  Joe fanatic and more of friend. Because that is how all wonderful relationships start. First we shall become best friends.  I am so excited to get to live with my best friend for forever. even if it isn't Joe. :)  Goll its 12:25 AM. The switchfoot tickets end ina few minutes. But they are at 76 bucks so I don't think its a possibility. Oh well. I shall  have to see if Ben has any tickets. I hope he does!  I will be quite sad if he doesn't.   DUDE!  My mom went to the store today *waaaahoooo*  SHE GOT THE BEST COOKIES IN THE WHOLE INTIRE STINKING WORLD.   They are from Canada, eh.  I have always loved them SOOOOOOOO much but I can only usually get them in Canada so my mom came home them and I was like "HOLY SMAKIE! YAYAYYAYAYAyAYAYyAAY" Then KY won by 20 points which increased my happiness.  GOSH  I am so happy.  When I was at the airport I thought my brother died in a terrorist attack. I don't ever worry about those thigns but tonight his plane was a half an hour late and on the screen it said he was on time..It was weird. So I started to get worried. He still didn't show up. So I started to pray then BANG there he was. *smile*  Tonight we had a comedy sports thing and I forgot the line I got 5 minutes before we were supposed to go up there and talk. It was kinda funnny..in a not funny sort of way. :)  Yeah.  Gosh. I am almost runnign out of things to say.   I guess I will stop saying thigns then.  Good bye..   Good day.  buutttt fezzzz  I SAID GOOD DAY!  hahahhahahahhaha  its late... ;)

            Hi!  happy saint patricks day.  It aint easy being greeeeeeen.  Wel, today I woke up at nine then ate my slurpee.  After that I practiced my spanish words for my test tomorrow. *yikes* Then I bid on the switchfoot tickets but I got over bid...by one stinking dollar.  But then I was looking on ebay and there are two more tickets up for bid so I will try to win those, if I don't win then its okay. I will just go to see spot rock and the sea of faces tour.  Today matt and i were supposed to clean so I have been waiting for forever. He just got home from his friends hosue and he is emptying the dishwasher. So,  while I was waiting for him to get home I just played my guitar for an hour. It was  very peaceful. I wrote a pretty song, you all have to hear it. But I probably wont get it on my album until I get garage band..I hope I get it soon! I need my album to come out NOW!!! :D  Well...today I have tennis. Which I am not tooooo excited but yeah. I am going to try to play a chalenge  match against Kelsey becasue I am positive i can beat her. Then I will be #31 which is quite excelent. I am kind of tired of tennis. It seems like all my friends are like "I love tennis!" "Tennis so easy!" "I hope I can beat #20 beacause then I will be #7 on JV!"  For me, every day at tennis is a new struggle. Everyone always seems to think they are better than me. The problem is, I  know I am really good at tennis. It just seems like I can't do it when people are watching me. Maybe thats why I love to be alone. While I am alone I can do all things, I can get straight A's, I can sell a platinum album, I can be the tennis champion at wimbleton. But in the eyes of others, they are always better than me. No matter how hard I try they will always be better than me.  But that is not the truth, I know I can do ALL THINGS. But only through Christ..and he and I have been kind of distant lately. It makes me sad....   But he is MY strength.  Lead me to the waters of forgiveness.  Hold me never let me go.  cuz i'm your child.  Though I try so hard,  I never cease to fail.  But, your my Go.  your always here for me...     Though I run  You place me in a hding place  Where i can stay..for a bit.  Your my refuge...  through the stormy times..  So, hold me- never let me go.

          It’s 6 a.m. and oldies are streaming quietly out of my small radio/alarm clock. I shuffle sleepily across the room, shut it off, and find myself back in bed. I utter a drowsy prayer thanking God for the new day. I ask Him for help. My season in Christianity’s desert continues.  I think we can all testify to spending some time in our own personal desert. We can all probably speak of that dryness, that spiritual malaise that eventually comes the believer’s way. If you haven’t yet, wait awhile it’ll come. Mine did. And although mine has been insignificant compared to what others have gone through, it’s lasted longer than I would’ve liked. It’s been a time of doubt, discouragement, and frustration that, at its worst moments, seemed to stretch out into eternity.   As is typical of people who are in their deserts, I’ve been asking a lot of questions. Questions that many Christians are familiar with. What should I do with my life? What does God want me to do with my life? Why am I here? Does God really love me? The questioning of God’s love seems to be the devil’s favorite tactic and is by far the most damaging to the Christian.  Like most followers of Christ, I pray. But its tough praying in the desert. When you’re in this stage of life, everything you say to God seems to malfunction about halfway up to heaven. More often than not, I feel like I’m just talking so things won’t be so quiet. Gone are the fragrant and passionate prayers. In the midst of the wasteland all I’ve got are smelly, weak mumbles. Most of the time I just end up saying, “I don’t know what I’m doing. Help.”  But no matter how much I question or doubt, holding fast to two main beliefs helps me through the tough times: 1) There is a God and 2) He happens to be published.   He’s got a book out, a darn good one; however, I doubt we can expect a sequel. I read part of His book everyday. In the mornings I read something from the Old Testament and before I go to bed I read something from the New Testament. It’s my lifeline to the faith. Technically, it’s every believer’s lifeline, but to me— the weary desert wanderer with malfunctioning prayers— it’s all I seem to have. Every time I read from that book of His, I’m reminded of what I know but am unable to sense. I’m reminded there is a God, He is watching over me, and He loves me.   There’s something about the Bible reminding me of these things that’s different from people reminding me. Recently in my Sunday school class, the teacher spent forty-five minutes talking about God’s omniscience and sovereignty. People pulled out verse after verse and read them while the teacher discussed them. I hated it. Not exactly a good Christian attitude, I know, but it’s how I felt at the time. It bothered me that those two attributes were all we focused on. When you’re in your desert, you want a God who is loving and caring, not a God who wills and allows everything, even the bad stuff. Trust me, when you’ve been operating under a darkly fatalistic attitude for awhile, the last thing you want to hear is, “We all just need a little bit more sovereignty!”  The Bible seems to keep things in check, usually never dwelling on only one attribute of God (although the prophets can be rather gloomy). The Bible presents everything in its context. I can’t imagine there being many pages that don’t reveal some attribute of God that relates to His goodness, love or mercy.   Read your Bible. This is my message to my fellow wanderers. When visiting the wilderness it’s easy to feel like you’re alone, but you’re not. I’m right there with you, and despite what the physical evidence may say, so is God. Don’t give up. As uncomfortable as it is to wander, I’d hate to think of what it’d be like to officially throw in the towel. I consider all this an opportunity to learn how this whole Christianity thing works. It’s a lot more complicated than people make it sound. So, until I’ve stumbled out of this wilderness, I plan to keep doing what I’m doing now: persevering. I’m certainly not the best at it, but that’s not what’s important. To me, the most important thing I can do is hold to those two core beliefs, offer up whatever prayer I’ve got on me, and keep on reading that epic bestseller of love and forgiveness.

            I just got back from tennis. We got the ladders. You will find the name "Laurel" at the very bottom. I am that person. its slightly depressing but its a very good thing. See, I usually get everything handed to me ona silver platter. this is something I have to work for.  Also, I think God is trying to make my humble. I obviously know i'm not the best one there.

           Hi friends! How are you all doing? I am doing well. The FREE tour has far exceeded our expectations! Thanks so much to all of you who have come out to have some fun with us, and who have volunteered and helped out in various ways...we have been so blessed by all of your help and prayers and we are really enjoying ourselves! In fact, I can\'t believe that so much of this tour is over already!  We are off a few days before we head out to NY. So we\'re hanging out in Chicago, working on some new songs, sleeping a lot and catching up on everything we can\'t do easily on the road. And I\'m letting my vocals have some rest too. I was wearing myself down a little bit; I think talking is my weakness! I love to meet new people, and I love to catch up with old friends at shows, so it’s hard for me to hold back on the talking thing!! \"So then, my friends, because of God\'s mercy to us...offer yourselves as a living sacrifice to God, dedicated to his service and pleasing to him. This is the true worship that you should offer\"                      Romans 12:1 ....I have been reading this verse from stage every night at our shows. Funny how things we share with others sometimes are meant for us or help us so much in the long-run! Lately this verse has become so beautiful to me! God has been so good to me this tour, really speaking to me, comforting me, being gentle enough to me through this time of brokenness. Things have started to come into focus more and more for me. So many times we struggle through life wondering why does God want my life to be so hard? Why does He allow me to hurt? The point is He does allow us to go through enough pain to bring our weaknesses up to the surface, to make our weaknesses visible, so that in our weakness, He can show His power! How much do I love that? I desire to be weak in that case, because I want His strength at work in me!! \"Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ\'s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ\'s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.\"  2 Cor. 12:9-10 I pray you are all doing well. Living a life of sacrifice to God, for God, for others...it is the only way to find your life truly, by losing it. By choosing every day who or what you will live for choosing to please God with every action, every thought, every little thing you do or don\'t do. And desiring that more than things that might temporarily make us feel better. Hope to see you soon! Look for us on our own tour possibly this fall!!! We are planning it right now, and so excited about our very own tour. Spread the news!!! Look for us in a city near you! Much luv--Tricia  \"FOR I KNOW THE PLANS I HAVE FOR YOU\", declares the Lord,  \"...PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND NOT TO HARM YOU, TO GIVE YOU A HOPE AND A FUTURE.\"  *JER. 29:11 -We must be willing to get rid of the life we\'ve planned, so as to have the life that is waiting for us. -Joseph Campbell- --

            Since obviosuly my problems aren't as big as karsens i shall shut up now.  Just because I had a horrible day doesnt mean I matter.  Doesn't mean people care.   For once why can't people ever look at me?  I know I am being stupid, but really.  I can't hear out of one ear...does anyone care?  I  guess not.  Today I was writing a letter in spanish and I got in trouble..I got mad..but oh well.

            Today was a horrible day.  First I woke up at 7:30 so I couldn't take a shower or anything, I couldn't even brush my teeth. Then when I put my contact in it hurt SOOO bad but I couldn't take it out because I didn't have anytime. Then, I don't think I told any of you this but I have been having a lot of hearing problems recently, I don't know why...but I couldn't hear at all in one ear.  So I was blind and deaf :)  Then when I got to school I realized that I left all my books on the dining room table with all my homework in it.  Sad times.  Then, I was in a rush to get to tennis and I went to go get my bag out of the bathroom and it was GONE. Someone stole it...I had 150+ dollars worth of wonderful stuff in that bag. Including my favorite shoes. waaa   So at tennis I had to use my horrible shoes that don't have any grip so I slipped and slidded all around the gym. It was kinda funny...in a really not funny at all sort of way.   Uh oh.   My play starts soon so I got to go.  I will recount my horrible day maybe..tomorrow...

            I decided not to post on the xanga any more becuase it seemed kind of unfriendly..but thats just me.  Tonight we were supposed to go to Target but hannah foolishly didn't do anyof her homework today or yesterday at CYT and instead played cards. She had not very much homework and she just put it off which caused me to suffer greatly. It makes me mad, I worked hard all these two days off and I got everything all done then she goofs off and causes me to suffer. Now they are going tomorrow while I am at piano. :(  Then I was bored so I cleaned out the fridge and after I finished I was putting the nasty old food in the trash and the whole can fell over spilling the contents all over the floor. I then had to clean this nasty noodle junk from the floor.   Thennn...I was making a yummy smoothie and my mom made me give half of it to my "hard working sister"  But, I did win a lip gloss from Lucky Magazine, which was cool.  The internet has been so good to me.   Liek the one time where I won 100  bottles of gatorade. That was funny.  After like two bottles I was like, "this is the most disgusting stuff in the whole world."  Today I finally ordered my sutff off of Delias which is *cool* I can't wait till it arrives.  Later gators,  Laura

       Hmm... Today was an ok day. Tennis was really hot! But it was still fun, my coach was like "Your doing SO much better!"  Then I went to tutoring but on the way I got another bloody nose. Grr. My third today! So I had to sit in the car for awhile till it stopped.   My family went to the mall why I was at tutoring. They never do that! They just shopped for like an hour. And for like a week I have been wanting to go to the mall, and when I told my family my dad was like "We can go soon!" then they go without  me! Gr!  I have enough money saved up for a whole new summer outfit. Yay.  The cool guy in american idol lost :(  The shark game is 0-0 Hmm..I hope the sharks win! I g2g to bed, see you all later.

            Wow.  Well, first it all started after school. Freddys car broke down so my brother was helping him and we didn't get to leave until 2:20 and it takes 20 minutes to get to prarie. So me being stupid I was like lets go home so I can get my sweatshirt cuz i'm cold.  So we were in quite a rush.  On the way home all the sudden I saw these flashing lights and I was like  "Oh crap."  My brother got a speeding ticket.  Yup, my perfect brother. This is the first time I have ever seem him speed, ever. It was horrible.   So we stopped by home and my mom found out so i like started to cry.  So my mom was like "Lets go to tennis" So I went and my eyes were all red because it was so horrible.  And everyone was like "are you okay?" haha.  I was a half an hour late. It was BAD!  But my coach was all nice and wonderful.  Then they did the introductions where they introduce like the top jv doubles.  So I was just standing there being bored because they never say my name...  and like the fourth name they were like "Laura Warman" and I was like "what the heck..whats going on?  Then the coach was like "Your on! Get out there!"  So I was like "YESS!" then a girl on my team named melissa was like "I really wanted to play with you so I asked the coach if I could."  She is the nicest girl EVER!  Oh my goodness. It was crazy,  Then I played like the best game of my LIFE! I only missed 2 serves! I rocked! And all this while playing like the top jv doubles.  It was AWESOME!  Then when my game ended I hung out with Sara and Hope! it was F-U-N! Then i had to go home and Emily and Johanna came over and we worked on our spanish project. Its pretty spiffy!  Yeah.  I guess thats it!  Talk to ya'll later! :)  Laura

           Today I had tennis pracice from 2:30-4:30. I almost died. I think I have already posted bout that though.  I got enchiladas at Baja Fresh and practiced my sapnish "skils" The cutest guy ever was ther. He was like 6 feet tall. he  had gorgeous eyes.  He had curly hair!  Yay.  I kept starring at him so he looked at me funny. Then, i went to go get salsa and I spilled it all over the floor right by him. Hahha Then I spilled my silverware!  Hahhaha  It was kinda not funny in a funny way.  Then we went to prarie and I served for and hour and a half straight.  I'm getting a blister on my fingers because of the over serving.   What school should I do to next year? I totally can't decide. I'm kinda freaked out.  Cam is nice..but i don't seem to be getting much out of it.  Hockinson is beautiful and wodnerful but I would be leaving alot of people behind at cam. I can't deccide!  And I only have till may 1 to decide! YIKES!

            Ugh. I never seem to live up to anyones expectations. My mom thinks I should get all As..do i? No. I should be good at tennis? Am I? No. I should practice my guitar every day..? NO. I can never be who everyone wants me to be. I would  rather be fat ugly lazy and stupid then always have to live up to everyones expectations.   But I am stuck in this world. Everyone wants me to be this perfect person.  I just want to hide.

           Fancy meeting you here. Well, I feel totally crapptastic!  Today ITED was just kinda..uh. One word to describe it would be "huh" like a dumb huh. Cuz I felt pretty dumb today. yeah. The highlight was Sara's weirdohead card thing. Haha. I'm marrying the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES- Eric Meland. Hahahaha. I kill Aaron, Marc is a hippie/ fashion designer, and NIck marries britney spears and lives on the streets.  Haha.  That was quiittee amusing. But, sara and I forgot to meet all of our people! Like the kid who loooks like Emily and the kid with cool hair...sad times.  After school I ate 4 popsicles (they momentarily remove my pain!) and took a shower. Then I went to tennis! It was SO fun! Everyone was being super nice to me for some reason..I got to play singles! It was crazy weird! but I still won! Wahhoo!!! Now, my rating is POSITIVE! I have won more than I lost! YES! Happy days! These days are ouuurrrs, HAPPY AND FREE! These days are ouuurss, come share them with ME!  Then I went to Katies house...that was interesting in a very scary way. Heather and Johanna had to leave early so it was just me, Kaite, Garrett, and Nick...I was like alrighty...this is akward. her mom cooked really good mexican food! It was tastyy. Then she gave us desert which was rice crispy treats, or as garrett calls them "KRISPY KREMESS!" yeah..  Then we watched this weirdo movie called "Hangmans curse" it was..interesting. Verrrry creepy...in a funny sorta way.  Now I am at home because my dad has his friends over who are missionaries in Indonesia. They are cool. I wanan be a missionary, but not in indonesia!  I am dreadfully sick...I am going to try to get super sick so I wont have to even face the world tomorrow, we will see how it goes :)

I love to be alone, but I just don't feel safe in this house. Yeah. :)  My mum just called. She is at an improv meeting. Fun stuph!  Oh! Tomorrow I have another game and somehow I have to get to katies house SUPER fast. So I hope the game: A. Is not an away game B. Ends fast  That woul dmake me muchas happy.

Yeah baby.  Oh! School today was CRAZY!  Hahhahahhahahah   I am now stalking this kid named Ryan Fredrick. I memorized his lisence plate number but I seem to have forgotten it.  Oh well!

           Ugh. I am in such a horrible mood.  Okay, so today we had a home game against Evergreen.   So I get there about Coach Linquist was like "From 15 down has to go to Heritage to play Evergreen on the open courts so we can get everyone playing faster"  So we were like okayyyy...  So when evergreen gets their we hop onto the bus with there 8 other players. Wow..their players...they talked about the sickest things I have ever heard in my life. I don't even want to type them out. They were POTTYMOUTHS!  So, we get to Heritage. Its a super coool school! I liked it a lot! They had a bunch of cool drummers playing outside. But, there were people playing on the tennis courts! Grr!! Heritage had a home game and they didn't tell us about it! Grr!!  So we were like..well..Grrr!  So we deicided to go to Evergreen. When we got there..wow. Its the ugliest grossest school I have EVER seen! eew! there was like mold on the courts.  So we start to play and all is jollly fine. Haha. There benches were made out of fiber glass and the people on my team were like "Don't sit on them! Last year, everyone got a rash when they sat on them!!" So I was like alrighty... :)  It was finally (well, it didn't tqake that long) my turn to play. So I start the game and I begin to feel sick..really sick. so like my serves were totally off. I was not having a good day by any means. So, as the game preceeds I feel worse and worse. The horrible part was, when I hopped out of my dads car, I dropped my water bottle and I didn't notice so I had noooo water! I thought I was going to faint. Then, the girl goes WHACK and hits me right on the chest with a zoooming ball. I was like "OOOOOOOOOOOWWW" I almost died. Seriously, I like fell over.  Then, the baseball batting cages were RIGHT next to the courts so all the baseball boys were like staring at us...*akward*  But, even through all this tragedy.. We still won! Yay!  now I am 3-3!  We have another game tomorrow, me thinks, so hopefully I will feel better so I can play together! Now I have to clean. YUCK!  Save me..  Laura Fantora

We cannot separate 'Cause you're part of me. And though you're invisible I'll trust the unseen.

See, i want to be there when the beatles first came of the plane into america. I would totally be one of those screaming girls. I would also be the girl who skipped church to go to the ed sullivan show. My mum would be quite angry.  We need something like the beatles. This generation is weak, we need something to hold us together! We need something to obesess about!  I'm out.. laura

            What a difference a year makes!    The San Jose Sharks can readily attest to that fact. Just a season removed from the most disappointing campaign in franchise history, San Jose not only bounced back to earn regular-season success and a Pacific Division title, but the Sharks also became the first team to advance from the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, eliminating the St. Louis Blues in five games.    These would have been considered unheard of developments last spring when the Sharks missed the playoffs after being picked by many as a likely Stanley Cup contender. There were significant management changes, with Doug Wilson becoming GM and Ron Wilson the head coach. And the roster got reshuffled in a big way as veterans like Owen Nolan and Bryan Marchment were dealt away. Popular winger Teemu Selanne then left as a free agent. So, no hope for 2003-04, right?   The Sharks sure didn't pay any attention to the doomsayers and in the process authored one of the top stories of the 2003-04 season, and now a new playoff chapter will be added.    The roster changes placed the emphasis for improvement on young players like Patrick Marleau, Brad Stuart and Alyn McCauley. After a rough start to the season and a team meeting, the Sharks got it together and haven't looked back.    "The players deserve a lot of credit," said Ron Wilson. "It is the story of the season that we won't give up."             By: Phil Coffey

Tim Foreman  [Does anyone really understand that?

I worshipped science. Its advance had surpassed man's wildest dreams. It took many years for me to discover that science, with all its brilliance, lights only a middle chapter of Creation.   I saw the aircraft I love destroying the civilization I expected it to save. Now I understand that spiritual truth is more essential to a nation than the mortar in its cities' walls. For when the actions of a people are undergirded by spiritual truths, there is safety. When spiritual truths are rejected, it is only a matter of time before civilization will collapse.   We must understand spiritual truths & apply them to our modern life. We must draw strength from the almost forgotten virtues of simplicity, humility, contemplation & prayer. It requires a dedication beyond science, beyond self, but the rewards are great & it is our only hope.--Charles Lindbergh   No sciences are better attested than the religion of the Bible.--Isaac Newton   The need of the World is to listen to God.--Albert Einstein  The most important thought I ever had was that of my individual responsibility to God.--Daniel Webster  [I wonder if he's the guy who made Websters dictionary..hmm :D ]  The New Testament is the best Book the World has ever known or will know.--Charles Dickens  [and I was beginning to not like Charles Dikens..]  It is better for me to be a martyr than a monarch.--Ignatius  [i wonder who he is]  [I can't beileve you read all these quotes..they are all so cool!]  I account the Scriptures of God the most sublime philosophy.--Isaac Newton  [Sublime! Like that one guy marrianne likes..]  The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection.--Michelangelo [That makes sense. Because it seems like alot of the good artowrk out there (nature seens and such) are just reprodustions of the already perfect art God made of the world]  "Peace is always beautiful."                                      --- Walt Whitman  "We will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." -- Martin Luther King, Jr  "A democracy without values is easily transformed into an underhand totalitarianism" -- John Paul II to the Italian Parliament, November 2002  "Goodness is the only investment that never fails." ~ Henry David Thoreau  "Et tu, Brute?" (You too, Brutus?) -Julius Ceaser [Hahah..that just struck me as funny. Hahhahaha]  "Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder."  "He who can suppress a moment's anger may prevent a day of sorrow."--Tryon  Edwards.  "To achieve your goals is to be successful; however, to achieve your dreams  is the ultimate success."--Ricky Lankford  "There is always truth in sarcasm."--Brian Deaton  "Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still."--Chinese  Proverb  [These are all so good! I can't stop!]  "Reputation is what you do when people are looking.  Character is what  you do when people aren't looking."--Parke Kallenberg  [I'm starting to sound like the character lady..;) ]  "Every exit is an entry into somewhere else."--Tom Stoppard  "I don't think of all the misery, but of all the beauty that still remains."--Anne  Frank [I love Anne Frank, I need to be more like her.]  "If you play with fire long enough, sooner or later your going to get  burned."--Ricky Lankford  [I admit it, i'm a pyro...:D]  "Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see  it tried on him personally." --A. Lincoln  "Anyone who loves learning excepts correction, but a person who hates being  corrected is stupid."--Proverbs 12:1  "Spend time with the wise and you will become wise, but the friends of fools  will suffer."--Proverbs 13:20  [I lovvvee Proverbs!]  "Hard workers will become leaders, but those who are lazy will be  slaves."--Proverbs 12:24  "The right word spoken at the right time is as beautiful as gold apples in  a silver bowl."--Proverbs 25:11  "Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest."--  Mark Twain  "In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity"-- Albert Einstein  "One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those  who are not present. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are not  present."-- Stephen R. Covey  "No legacy is so rich as honesty"-- William Shakepeare  "You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back."--Barbara De Angelis  "A little rebellion every now and then is a good thing."--Thomas Jefferson [I'm a rebel girl..in a rebel world ;) Just kiiding. But seriously, thats  a good quote because if we always did what others were doing we would get nowhere in life. Dare to be different, don't conform to this world any longer!] "What the mind is full of the mouth runs over with."--Evelyn Wunderly  "We all die, but do we all truely live?"  "Shared joy is double joy. Shared sorrow is half sorrow."--Swedish Proverb  I guess thats it..gosh, I LOVE quotes!

            I am making a garden!!! Its going to be GORGEOUS! Its going to have brick pathways made with some extra bricks that make been laying around. Its going to have a nice wood bench surrounded by large shading plants where I can sit in the summer time and read or write. its going to have wonderful smelling flowers and fresh herbs. The best thing of all, i'm going to make it all by myself!  I began the work on my garden earlier today. I dug up the area of my garden.  When I was busy digging my dad pulled up, home from my grandparents. When he saw that I was busy destroying our pricless lawn he got SO mad! He was like "What are you doing?!?!?!?!" So I told him about my garden and how mom said I should dig there. We was like "I don't want this mess to be the first thing people see when they drive up!!" He was mad.  But my garden will be beautiful I will show him! Mwa haha.

Today at tennis it started PORING rain! It was sue-wheat! So I smelled it. Rain smells so good. so we all ran inside. Then I had to call my mom but no one was home so I wandered around the prarie halls for a half an hour.  It was fun. Hhaha. Then my mom was like "You can go to prarie next year if you want!!" and i was like no thanks...  So now I am still wet. It grand. I feel so fresh. And considering I haven't taken a shower in three days (shhhh..I know its sick...I like being dirty!) Its nice to feel clean again.  Hmm.  Hahhahhahahahahhaha  Tonight is the apprentice final!

            Hello!! Gosh I am tired.  So, I obviously had like the worst bloody nose of  my whole life. I bet like 2 cups of blood has gone out from my head. It was disgusting. So now I am super dizzy. It lasted for two hours. Those two hours I had saved to do the finishing touches on my mouse trap car. Those two hours wasted. Haha. Oh well. I got to watch good tv. Like the Jessica and Nick variety show and extreme make over home edition..and! Dateline. Hahha. Yeah.   So now I am SO exhausted. Those kids were scary...man. They took like 2 years off of me. Then when my nose bleed ended and I came down stairs and my mom was like yelling at me because I wasted 2 and a half hours on watching TV.  I was like there wasn't a single thing I could do!!!  When ever I got up I would just bleed over everything.  Yuckkk.  I am so dizzy I think I am going to puke.

            So, on Thursday I went to Mandy's house.  I will pick off where I left it...  We walked up stairs and said hi to Amberly and I looked at her gorgeous colage. Its pretty spiftacular.  Then we decided to walk to target.  So we walked there...I almost got killed by a scary californian driver!! it was freaktacular.  At Target Mandy got a Kelly Clarkson CD and a Freaky Friday book.  Then we walked back.  Amberly had made some yummy pizza so we ate that and started to watch Ever After.  it was a pretty good movie, as far as romance movies go. :)  Then we just wandered around her abode aimlessly and she started to cook her beef.  Then we ate the beef.  Then we went to youth group.  Hahhaa.  I love californians.   Especially ones whose names are Brian and whose last name is that restaurant thats your neighbor.  Haha.  But, alas, I cannot marry Brian Applebee because, according to Mandy, he is a jerkface.  Oh well.   Then we went home and watched the wonderful Sharks game!  they won!  Wahhoo!  Then we went to bed.  And didn't wake up until good friday.  Then I went to San Fransico.  I didn't really like that town.   except for the SUE-WHEAT paul frank store. :)  Its was dirtty and smelly and had lots of street people.   But yeah.  Then we left san fransico and went  to see the golden gate bridge.. wait...that is in san fransico. Oh well!!  It was TOTALLY covered with fog. It was kinda amusing. We couldn't see any of it except for the tippy top.  Haha.  Then we began our drive home.  The End.   Its EASTER!  I got  a SUE-WHEAT belt. It has tennis rackets on it. Its muy gorgeous!  I also got, 2 pairs of sue-wheat earings, some eye shadow, and a lip gloss. What a haul!  I also got muches candy.  Well, I am off to the easter service!  Buh bye ;)  Laura

            HI!  I just got back from the store. It was..yeah. There were so many clevage-bearing-girls-who-have-nothing-to-do-on-a-saturday-night-so-they-seduce-the-cashier. It was sorta creeeeeepy. They are glared at me. I guess they can't stand a girl who will always look betetr than them even if she doesn't have make up and is wearing sweats and old flip flops. Or maybe they did look better than myself...I'm just trying to make myself feel better ;)  After we went and got our California pictures developed my dad was like "Do you want a treat?" So I of course said yes even though I knew deep down inside that if I had anymore sugar I would explode (considering I ate candy, soda, and chips all the way to the Washington border)  So we went of in search of fatty-a-licious ice cream (Much so those wanna be skinny girls dismay after they saw me and choclate ice cream mehehehhe) I got a klondike bar. It was pretty good.  As I ate it I found myself wondering about my three favorite questions: why do I exist, why is the sky blue, and how do they make klondike bars.  See, its choclate all around. All the choclate is the same width and there arne't any creases on where is was set to dry. And they put melted choclate on frozed ice cream without the ice cream melting or the choclate freezing to fast. Amazing.  Since I am in the SUPER LONG post mood I shall post about my vacation.   On thursday I woke up at 8.  See, my brother stole my bed because he said it was his turn for the nice area.  So I had to sleept downstairs. Every morning a freako garbage truck would whiz bye going "BEEEEEP" which never ceased to wake me up. (except for the time Mandy spent to night..:-D  )  So I was up. I packed my bags in preperation for the ride home.  At 10:07 we were off to Watsonville. The whole way I just thought of what I would say to this amazing person I was about to greet.  Then we arived.   I said Hi! She said Hi!  And now I have to go to bed.  :)

           I just watched a memorial day show on PBS. It was the saddest thing I have ever seen...it featured letters from solders who died...it showed all the death and destruction war causes...Why do humans do this to eachother? I will never know..but I will always know that every human life is important and no one should ever take away another mans right to live.  •In Memory of everyone who lost their lives in war•

            Well, acctually I'm not going to talk about him...   The  picnic was acctually pretty fun.  Improv sold hotdogs and hamburgers and we made over 300 dollars!!! Wahooo!!!  Then we did the throw a pie at improv people and my grandpa won to throw a pie at me. It was so funny! Then this other person threw a bucket of water at me and I got wet. It was really cold. So I was a big lump of creamy wetness. It was great!!  Then i went home and took a super long shower. It was reallllll nice!! I don't feel like blow drying my hair so its gonna be really curly but thats ok.  I was sitting next to Jacki, Jennifer, and Christina and they were talking about my Turtle and christian was like "He is toooooo skinny for me!! I don't want a boy who is skinner than ME!" And I was like "Uh..ok..he isn't that skinny." She was calling herself fat. Haha. Well, acctualy the turtle was skinny, but I like skinny white boys.  Just when i thought her eyelashes coudln't get more disgusting..they did. *cringes* They are like an inch thick!!!

            I love having inspiring post titles like that. I could talk for hours...  I wonder how many people read this.... Maybe I should put a hit counter on it..btu those are kinda cheesey. 200 people read my profile which is kinda creepy if you asl me. I wonder who reads it? I bet there are tons of random people who read my blog. I wonder if anyone from China reads it... My mom wnats me to make and apron for improv. Hah. WHy does everyone thign I am so handy? My mom is all like "Your the fashion person, make it!" I AM NOT A FASHION PERSON. I despice fashion with my very being. Everyone thinks I am all fashionable and I care alot about clothes but I don't. I wish people would stop thinking I am something I am not.   Ugh.... :)  For improv we must sell hot-dogs and hamburgers. I guess it will be fun...whenever I am around the Improv people I get really nervous becasue they are always always ALWAYS funny...I am not funny...I just like to observe everyone and not talk very much...all they do is talk and laugh. Whenever I am around them I feel inferior..  Now my mom is in a SUPER DUPER WOOPER bad mood and she is like "Go make an apron!"   Right.

           I just finished talking to Sara from Inhabited. She is my hero. I was telling her I either wanted to be a missionary or a history teacher and she was like "I wanted to be those exact things when I was your age!" Then I was telling her how I really wanted to go on mission trips but my parents were to scared to let me go and she told me how her parents were the exact same way but she just kept praying and God changed their hearts and let her go. Isn't that cool?!!? So I decided to pray a ton about it.  I have been thinking a ton lately.  What do I really want to do with my life? Its only 3 years until I graduate from highschool...only 7 years until I graduate from college and have to set off on my own. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can support myself on my own...I am quite worried. How will I get money? It would be awesoem to be a teacher and it seems like there are a lot of jobs for teacher but they don't get payed that much...what to do what to do...  I have also been wondering about what I should do with my summer...I think I am going to do summer servants so I can grow in my relationship with God then next summer I will be able to put my relationship in action!  I am so excited!!!!  The month of June brings so many promises of new beginnings and new adventures...but I fear leaving the old behind.  New School... New Friends...  New Life.

            I was listening to the KISN Memorial day 500 Coutdown and guess who was number one?! PAULIE!!!! Singing  "Yesterday" I danced and sung along and my mom looked at me like I was a freak. I have offically decided that cherry jolly ranchers are the best tasting things ever.  Somone needs to tell me a topic of something to ramble about. Whats the fun in rambeling when you know no one is listening. Any suggestions?!  Your friend,  Laura Fantora

            I just finished cooking dinner, it was really good.  I decided not go become a fashion designer....  My new plan for life issssssss...  I am going to get my degree in buisness then open a RESTAURANT! *w00t*  How exciting.   I am alone again...  My brother and Kyle left again.  My dad and Matt went to the beach and didn't even tell me. How weird. Oh well.  My mom and Hannah wont be back until 9:30.  It seems like everyone has something do do and someone else to do that thing with.  jacob has Kyle...  Dad has Matt...  Mum has Hannah..   Who do I have?  no one...

           just don't ask.   I saw this guy in the car and he looked exactly like Mr Bean it was great!  So we went to Portland and I was being really dumb because I am sick and tied and my mom yelled at me. I felt really guilty...  Then I saw this HUGE group of guys. There were lke 30 of them and they were all my age. Hahah.  I am supposed to be ushering at CYT right now but I am too sick so I went home instead.  I was going to write a totally huge rambeling of everything but, alas, I am going to finish my BEAUTIFUL science poster.  I heart science.

            Last night I dreamed we were at hockinson and Sara went to hockinson also and on the very first day of school Sara found a boyfriend. It was sooooo weird. He was really nice though, and he had a cool car.  Then we all (Katie's boyfriend [i dunno where he came from!!!] Sara's boyfriedm Katie, Heather, sara, and I) went out for sushi! Hahhahahaa  My mom is in a super good mood today so she was like "Want to go out for breakfast?!?!?" so I was like cooooool! So we get to go to downtown portland for breakfast! Haha. I am quite excited.  Then I have to go to CYT again and be and usher.  But its okkk!  Lalalalalallal

           THE WHITE WITCH!!!  Oh how I long to be the white witch! Is it selfish of me to always want to be the main parts?  The Fall CYT play is The Lion, The Witch, nd the Wardrobe and I REALLL|Y want a main part.  There is only ONE problem...  I can't sing.  So its a big problem.  The main parts always have many solos.  I think I am going to take voice lessons again..but NOT from Damien.  What do you think?

           I shll always ponder...until the day I die.  I was at CYT all day. It was almost scary. Like when Jenny popped out of a corner and was like "LAURA!" and scared me so bad I triped and ran into a microphone stand and made it fall over. Bekah just laughed. Haha. Then this one guy named Jermey was like "Come sell popcorn with me!" andI was like "No thanks..." Even though he cut his mullet he will eternally scare me. Then he liked grabbed my shirt and was like "COME SELLL POPPED CORN WITH ME!" so I kicked him and ran away. Freako rapist.  At the end of the second show Jacelin (I totally cannot spell her name!) and I we hidding in the balconey and whenever Bekah would pass by we would yell "BEKKKKKKAHHHHHH!!!!!"  then hide behind the railing. She never even noticed. Haha. So then we told her afterwords what we did and she was like "You did??" she laughed.   I found out who my sisters secret pal is! Its Jauclin!! and Hannah thinks its Taylor. Hahah.   I like knowing things other people don't.  Jacelin told me about this guy at her school who is her friends boyfriend and he has a list and whenever people make him mad he puts them on "The List" and I was like "Heyyyyy, that was MY idea!!" I have had a list forever!!!! Then Lauren copied me too.. Gosh, I guess I am justr to amazing for some people to handle. Righhhttt.  During one of the scenes in the play this kid named Kasey is supposed to say "Hi Fern!" (fern is one of the girls names) and he said it in the funniest voice I have ever heard. It was the voice weird guys use when they are madly in love "Hiiiiiii Phhh..ern!!"  so everyone on stage laughed so immensly hard that none of them could say their lines. I laughed too.  By the end of the second show I had gotten even sicker! Its so sad. I was so dizzy I could barley stand :(  Oh well.  Another night, another trauma- the sotry of my WONDERFUL life!! [i'm not kidding, i do have a great life!]

           I think I am going to perform a scientific study on how people eat lucky charms. I pick out all the real cereal parts and eat the marshmallows last. But some people eat all the marshmallows first then eat the cereal. And some really weird people just eat it all at once.  I need all of your data!  You can post it in the comment box! :)  Since some of you may not know what I do I shall give the definitions of things in my life:  CAM: Character Achademics Marketplace High School. That is the weirdest name for a school I have ever heard! It doesn't even make sense!!! *sigh* CAM..what will I do with that place. CYT: Christian Youth Theatre. Its the theatre I do and its qutie quite fun! They have three shows every year and you have to tryout to get in. For the tryouts you have to sing a solo. Its always really scary for me because I can't sing very well! Improv: Every year there is a CYT Improv Competition in San Diego. You can to take an improv class then they choose the top 5 people from the class to compete. This year I was chosen so I have rehersals every week. On July first we are going to San Diego. *w00t* New Hieghts: The church I go to. Its SO huge. 6,000 people go there! I just started going about a year and a half ago, I like it very much.   Well, I can't think of anything else to explain, but if you don't get something I say, just ask!!

            I don't know where that came from. Its is a Saturday morning and I am dreadfully sick. I went to bed at 12 and I woke up at 11:30. What should be enough. But during the night I just got sicker and sicker. I was sweating like a marshmallow. It was disgusting! When I got up I could barley stand and I almost fell over. My vision got all cloudy...  But I have to be an usher at CYT all day..I'm kinda stuck. I wish I could stay home,but I already said I would be an usher.

I really wanted to go to there concert on June 2 but since I am not very smart I forget to buy tickets and they are sold out..I have get one on ebay for 20 bucks but my mom would never let me go to some concert by myself. I CAN'T WAIT TILL I AM OLD!!!!!!  But the concert tonight would be so freaking scary is I went. The band there is called like Zao or something and they are some super hardcore christian rock band. Hahha. SCARY. He never does anything but go "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Hahaha. I wonder if he ever looses his voice. That would really suck to be in concert and not be able to talk. Haha. Well I guess he never talks anyways so it wouldn't make much of a difference. he just yells and screams. Haha.  My brother andhis friends are searchign for ear plugs. Good idea. ;)  Not they are doing a demostration of what to do in amosh pit situation. Hahaha. I can't think of much to sayy sayyy sayyyy. So I will go awaaayyyyyyyy. Maybe.

           ABOUT YOUR FACE!!! Hahha.. OOkayyy.  Today was a really crazy folk day. In english we found out Miss S has a 13 year old sister named Keisha. Hahaha. And her favorite band is Nickleback. Lol! Marc was liike "Wow..i;m impressed"  Then in science we did this tuning fork thing where we would bang a tuning fork and make pretty noises...thennn while the fork was still vibrating we put it in this water and it would splash EVERYWHERE!! Hehhehehhehehe. It was so much fun! By the end of the period we were all soaked but eric cleaned up all the water for me. Yay.  Then in Spanish..well nothing exciting happened. Yeah.  Then we had lunch because it was am assebmly schedule. ANDD..at lunch I got Heather chips. AND  The guy with the music note tatoo was at school!!!!! Heather was like "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" It was quite amusing. But Sara missed it because she is in Canada :(  In math we were supposed to have a test but we didn't because it was a shortened period.  At the assembely we were learnign aboooooot security. It was funny because the speaker mainly said "You can't be secure with out God." and these two girls behind me were like "SEPERATION OF CHURCH AND STATE!" I laughed..  Probably because I am ignorant ;)  Just kidding. We were discussing this in english...it had something to do with eggs and emily's brother.  :)  Then today my mum took me to coldstone for some odd reason.  ts was cool. They gave me free topings. The guy who was serving us was like "Whats your favorite desert?" and my mom was like "Cheeeeeeeese!" and he was like "Okay.."  I got lemon sorbet with gummy bears. MmmMMMMMMM!  Then we wint to Michaels and I got some purty blue ribbon. :D  Then we went to Winco and i saw this person and I couldn't tell if he/she was a he or a she. Haha. He/she looked a lot like a girl but then when he/she talked he/she sounded exactly like a guy... :/ he/she was hitting his/her poor kids :( It was kinda depressing.   Purty soon I am going to improv practice. Muy interesate.  You guys all have to come and see my perform at the showcase next thursday and the memorial day picnic ;) Fun Stuffff!!!!  Buh byes!

           You and I both...  felt the same we both thought this would never end but suddenly as if by chance its over  oh how I miss you.. oh how I long for your touch.. I want you I want to be with you.. forever  See, even I can write sappy love songs...  Haha. To bad I stole the title from someone else. Haha.  Alrighty.  I can't decide what to do with my summer.  So, I was making my Officail SUMMER CALENDER. And I only have 3 open weeks my whole summer.. and one (or at least part of that one) is being taken up by Mandy. Hmm..  What to do.  Because I want to be  on summer leadership with church but I also want to work at Royal Ridges..and I can't possibly do both.  Hmm... I htink I will probably be a counselor at RR, thats what it seems like God wants me to do...  but then today at church Scott said that he wants me to apply to be in Summer Servants...then I would do like everything all summer with the church. Which seems fun and I really want to but I just don't know what to do... Ladedadedo.

           It seems like I always get in trouble...One time I was on a Superchick message boards and my mom got SO MAD [why I am typing this i am getting increasingly angered..don't mind me] that she banned me from the computer for a week and was like "Don't talk to people you don't know!!" And I was like "Its a message boards..and I bet you that if you were to read every post ever on the board you wouldn't find any questionable content" and she got even more mad. But, Matt...he is ALWAYSSSS on the xbox message boards and in random chat rooms talking to these physco people and my mom doesn't even care..then this one time and I don't even want to  say what I didn't but my brother did the EXACT SAME THING at the same time and he didn't get caught but I didn't and I had to live in solitary confinment for two weeks. Then this one time I had 2 popsicles in one day my my brother told on me and I got in trouble then the next day he eats 3 popsicles and doesn't get in trouble. I don't think I can survive living with him. HE DRIVES ME CRAZY.  It seems like everyone is always studying everything I do and when I mess up, if even a little, everyone jumps on that oppurtunity to push me down into the ground and slowly combine my bien with the dirt.

            When I got back from the sleepover I was like "I wanan go to portland." and my mum was like "ok!" So we went. We went out to eat at elephants which was much tasty. And we went to the saturday market..which was kinda gross. then we went to pioneer place. I got a belt for my sister. But nothing for me...   Then I had my LAST GUITAR LESSON! How exciting! Now i officaly have NO LIFE! I am so excited this is the first time EVER that I don't do anything except for school. As weird as it  may sound its TRUE! All my life I have ALWAYS been busy..but now I AM NOT!   Now for a story.  So at Hello Dolly there was this guy who was sitting in front of me and he kept looking at me..so I was like "He is coool.." because he was. He had a kinda blonde-ish hair and he was wearing a teenage mutant ninga turtle sweatshirt. Haha.  After the show I just kinda forgot about him but then on the way to target on friday I was him..driving a car...in his teenage mutant ninja turlte jacket. Hahaha. He had a ton of bumper stickers. One said "We Love Jesus" and the other one said "Air1" then he had a sticker for my brothers karate place. Hahha. My brother knows him and everything. And my mom was like isn't that the picks friend? so she knows him tooo! It was soo weird....

            I was working on my garden this afternoon but I didn't get much done... I think because I was mad...see.. I made this garden to be Laura's garden. But my dad now thinks its his garden that I do all the work on. Its really making me mad. When I was first making my garden my mum told me where to make it so I dug it all out. Then my  dad came home and he made me fill in back  up which was  a waste of time. I like the old spot WAY better than the place it is now. Now its covered by trees and they are always dropping crap on my garden. Then I was digging and and he made me dig it in a stupid certain shape. I WANT A SQUARE. He wants a circle. Then I had to dig the trench for the brick. I did allt hat and it took about a day. Then why I am at school my dad tells Jacob to roto-till my garden and ruins all the work I did on it.  It used to be a place where I could hang away from the earth. but now its turing into my fathers garden..and i don't like it.

          Haha. I hate when people spell it that way. Today I am going to garden and fix my poor baby that Jacob ran over with the rototiller. *siighh* He ran over my pretty flower. At least my cucumber was saved. Yay! Then I am going to a play called "Hello Dolly" It should be muy interesante.  A kid from my church is in it. Haha.    Yeah... Tomorrow is opening night for charloettes web! how exciting!  Haha I think I miught go to the post show party. Its at burger ville and I REALLY want a milk shake. But I don't want (Evan says hi) [He says he is avalible..hmm... *wink* *wink* [That was evans doing also..] Anywho..I don't want to always be at the show because it gets really boring after a while. But oh well.   I am in history right now.  Emily was like "WHY WONT MY STUPID PAPER PRINT?!?!?!?!" And as it turns out she forgot to press the print button. Hahhaha. She is blonde at heart. I think she used to be blonde when she was a little kid.  Today in science we did an experiment with slinkys! It was AWESOME!! We made Melissa do all the work and Daniele and I just played with the slinky. He got it SOOOOOO tangled it was really bad. We thought we were going to get in trouble but then Melissa untangled it. Yay!  In science we switched our persuasive papers and we had to argue against them [Evan wants you to IM him- daredog56] and I had to argue against Tony's paper and his paper was about how dumb keryy is. Haha. So I was like "Kerry rocks!!" Hahha. It was kinda bad..but yeah. Since i went to that convention thing I knew alot of pro-Kerry arguments. Haha.  Now everyone is tlaking about how I am advertising Evan via the internet. Eric thinks its funny. SPeaking of them two...MArc got his braces off and Eric got his cast off. What a dealio. Well, I don't feel like writing ANY MORE!!  Bye!!!  You buddy for ever. [For ever and ever you'll stay in my HEARTT and I WILL LOVE YOU forever and ever]  laura FANTORA

            Uh..yeah. It was interesting.  Zane didn't show up till like 8 so I was like "Yes! He isn't here!" But then he was...it was scary.  The fog machine set off the fire alarm so we all had to go outside.. It was kinda funny. Then Marianne dumped her water bottle on the floor and I took a step and slipper on bonked my head on a stair. It hurt so stinking bad. I couldn't breathe for like 30 seconds and I thought I was going to die.  My back stil hurts really bad and I can bareley move it...  Oh how I loathe high school dances!! I was exposed to way more stuff than I was like my first 9 years. :)

            To bad I can't even spell it. but I am watching it and they had this question that was like if you had a penyn and you doubled it every day how long would it take you to reach 1 milion dollars. It made me laugh because we just did that problem in WA history. Haha. 27 days! So I was making a shirt for spanisha nd I totally killed it. It was sooooo coool until I had to put a picture on it and I didn't realize how big the iron was and I melted all the letters. Haha. Its pretty horrible. So, now if I want to do the t-shirt project I will have ot buy a whole new t-shirt and letters. Grrr there goes 10 bucks. *siiighhh* I hope this guy doesn't loose!! He doesn't know the answer..yeah. Sad timeees. Lala.  Today I had improv. It was ok. We just played games and such. Yeah. Tomorrow I get to go see Dean and Kerry in Portland. How exciting!

            Let it be? And when the broken hearted people Living in the world agree, There will be an answer, let it be. For though they may be parted there is Still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  Dashboard confessional in coming to town. June first. Which kinda sucks because I don't think I can go because thats the night of our tennis party.  I feel as if I don't have a life..I have just been posting all day long.  I really feel like making a meaningful post...but..I don't know. Does anyone even read this? See, the reason I blog is because I like everyone ot be able to read my thoughts..my dreams..my life. But does anyone even care? If just just stop posting would the world notice?  I am in a depressing mood, just ignore me.  But, I get to be a counselor this summer. Yay. But how am I supposed to minister to little kids if I am always so sad? I don't even think I am always sad. but on lonely Friday nights like tonight I wonder if its all worth it. Will my life be worth anything? When i'm gone will people care?  Why can't I get a boyfriend? (now I am starting to me shallow) Its seems as though if I had a boyfriend I would have someone who loved me...someone who loved being by me and always wanted to hang out with me..  I know all this is fulfilled by God but I want a human being. I real live person. I want someone, anyone, who loves me.  Is this to much to ask?

            So, I was looking in the freezer today. [Wait. Emergency break in this normal blog post]  Everyone thinks I like Matt Bryerly! Hahahhahaha. Daniel just asked me if I did and he was like "Evveryone thinks you do." and I was like "Who told you that?" and he was like " I don't remember.." I don't like him! I barley even ever talk to him. My goodness.  [Return to normal]  And I saw this box of rootbeer in the freezer and I was like "Mom..not again!!!" One time she put pop in the freezer and it exploded. Haha. but it was these really tasty rootbeer float things. Yum.  I have posted so many posts today..I am that bored. la de da de do.

            That was the sound of my french bread as it slowly cascaded down to the wood floor. As if it took minutes, it slowly floated down to our historical floor we weren't even aloud to mop. It was that sacred. When it landed, I could feel embarrassment rush to my face in the color of an apple. A red apple. "Laura!" My dad yelled, Oops.  That my friends is how to get an A in english. I have no clue why I just wrote that..it just sounded cool. I love to write. Its so much fun!  I am listening to Yellow Card. If I could find you know things would  be better.  Just a few minutes ago I was taking advantage of blogger cool search thing where you click on one of your interest and it pops up with other people who have the same interest. So I put in relient k and this guy popped up named Collin. He is 15 and he lives in San Deigo.  I loves relient k, FIF, and the beatles. He is like the cooolest guy I have ever read...if that makes sense at all. You should check him out. Well, not literaly..just read  his blog. :)  http://collinbell.blogspot.com  I wonder what he looks like..i can't help but imagine. I bet he is kinda tall..blonde hair. a jock..but not to much of a jock. I bet he doesn't care what other people think of him...i bet he isn't really popular but he has a few close friends..  Whenever I see people in the car as we drive by I can't help but wonder what their lifes are like. Are they happy? Do they have a family? Do they just go home and cry? I always make up lifes for them...   Whenever I see houses as we drive past I always imagine what went on in that house. Was their much joy? A painful divorice?  A sucicide? A musician? Hope? Joy? Love? Peace? Then I find myself dreaming about them.   One house I rowed by everyday on crew I wrote their story..the wife was a journalist and husband  was also...they desperatley wanted a family, but it wasn't happening.  Everyday, the wife would stand on the lush, green, hill, and wonder. "Would I ever be a mother?"  Oh, I am rambeling...

            I just want to go to home depot. So my dad was like "Ok! I will take you on friday!" So i had been looking forward to it so I oculd finally get some work done on my garden... Just a second ago he was like "Lets go tomorrow, I am to busy" All of these unkept promises are starting to anger me. I don't even think my dad knows how to keep a promise nor the importance a promise can be to his 14 year old daughter...

I just went outside in the sun and took photographs. Some turned out pretty good.  I am going to go to home depot tonight to get some stuff for my garden! *Excited*  This weekend will be interesting..tomorrow I am going to garden at the church..then guitar lessons...then church.  On sunday..i just have improv. I think I am going to garden alot on sunday, also.  Hmm..I guess there isn't much to say..  Hockinson called and I am number 2 instead of 3.  I think I am going to hockinson next year. Sara might move. :(  I saw Karsen at school today. :) Her hair is getting really long :)  I can't wait till summer. I don't think I can stand school much longer.  Our water line is broken.  And I have to go to the bathroom realllly bad! Ugh! :)  Talk to you all later!  laura fantora

When I reach 60,000 we shall have to have a big par-tay! :)   Today I have to go to the dermatologist with my brother for some cryptic reason. Then I have to go to the orthodontist. Yuckkkk! I also need to start studying for my spanish test. I am so nervous! I always do really bad on spanish tests for some reason. They are dummbb!   A person from my old rowing team got a scholorship to go to yale because of his rowing talent..isn't that coool?! I wish something like that would happen to me, but alas, it never does.  I want to go a really coool college. I'm thinking maybe in florida because I love beaches and its just the perfect temperature during the school year. :) But, I really want to go to somewhere on the east coast (i know, florida is on the east coast..but the northern east coast!) I love big cities and everything but its just so stinking cold! I hattteeeeee cold!   I better go...skin doctor time! :/  Laura Fantora

This one guy there ran right into me on purpose then he kept walking but he turned and smiled at me and I was like "Right..."  Tomorrow I shall be very busy. Ay yi yi! I have an orthodontist thing at 11 then I have a meeting with my college counselor at 2:30 then I have to go to spanish. It doesn't seem like much..but it is!  I really need to clean too..I wanted to get this really cool shirt. It says "We be illin" on it then under that it says "Sacred Heart Childrens Hospital" hahhaha. I think its quite amusing. Ever since I posted my blog for everyone ot see weirdo people have been e-mailing me..i'm like "Alright..."  :)  Later gators!  laura fantora

I just blowdryed my hair so now I am really bored..I am all ready for school but we don't leave for an hour!  Crazyness.  Today I have schooooool, tennis, and church. It looks like its raining right now so I might not even have tennis. Yay. Then I would work on my garden and practice my geeeeetar! Happpy days.  Weather.com says its supposed to rain until 12 then get sunny again..I doubt I will have tennis but its still a possibilty. Yay. I love tennis..but I have many other things to do!  I better start studying for spanish..we should have a test when our teacher gets back. Did you hear about that? Her sister is like dying so we is gone and no one knows when she will get back.  We were supposed to have a test today but we obviously aren't. Yay!  I wonder what I should make for lunch today..oh yeah! Its pizza day! Wahooooooooo!  I think I will get 2 peperonis.

The sobe  comes in cans! hahha. Its weird but cooool!  I haven't had one yet because they are a dollar for a little can which is kinda expensive. My bangs are really crispy.

I don't know the least about to say to some random guy that you think its attractive. Snapp.. Hmm. I have improv practice tonight. Its kinda scary. I hope I can be funny. I want to go to that thingy Sara goes to but, alas, I cannot. *sigh*  Lalala.    Tomorrow I have school, tennis, and church. Hmm.

Today, tennis was canceled at about 3:15 because it started to rain a lot..so I was all by myself just wandering around prarie..  So, in the halways I kept seeing this guy..he reminded me of Davis a lot..anywho. I kept seeing him..kinda like he was following me..so I was like hmm..Then I was sitting on this bench and he just sta next to me..I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say like "Hey" or something..so I just sat there..and so did he..for like 15 minutes. It was the weirdest thing ever..do people at prarie just sit in silence? Then his mom came and he left..I was like "Hmmm" I think his name was Justin.. He was fairly cute...I hope I see him tomorrow.  Such weirdness this prarie place is..

            I have the weirdest thoughts sometimes. Like I just read the bbc and it was about that president that got assisnated and thats what I thought it said...yeah :)   Today was mums day! Yeah.  We had to get a present for my aunt so we went to nordstrom and I kept seeing all these people I knew. It was kinda freakky... First I saw a girl from my rowing team..then this girl from CAM. Then Lauren. I was like "whoa hey..people go away!"  Thats a cool saying. It kinda ryhmes. I got the coolest sunglasess at nordstrom. They are like totally rockstar shades. Plus, they were only 10 dollars! I am really tempted to wear them tomorrow with my "I heart pad thai" shirt :)  After nordys we went to the buffett thing. It was at the Heathman Lodge. Purty place.   I ate so much. And my cousin, David is obsessed with Paul Mccartney!! We are going to stalk him together. he was like "Its my life goal to meeet Paul McCartney" and I was like "Wow..me to!"  Then there was this guy there and he was probably my age. And whenever I went to go refil my plate he was ALWAYS there. It was a little creepy. He like followed me in the food line... then when we were leaving he was leaving to! I was like "Hmm"  When I got home I just used the computer for ages then I gardened for an hour. I love my garden. Its purty! I can't wait to put all the flowers and such in it. How exciting!  Now I am just being bored...I am gonna study for my science test purty soon. :)  Adios Amigos!

           Emotional breakdown.  Oh my goodness.  It seems like no cares cares either. They are all caught up in their own lifes...their own "problems" Now I am starting to be stupid.  But I should have won.  I have been humble long enough. I know what its like to loose.  Where are you God?  Why have you denide me of the only thing I wanted most?  I shed so many tears..I hit so many balls.  Then the whole season is over.  Just one game.  But what makes me the MOST FREAKIN MAD  Is that those other girls where the worst line callers on the stupid face of the stupid planet.  WE COULD HAVE WON.  UGH  They were like "Oh it was out"  BUT IT WASN"T  UGH  I saw it and I wa slike "I saw that ball, it was in"  "Uh. no!"  freak heads.  Then there stupid cheering section.  Which included carl click which was cool but still.  YOU DON'T CHEER AND TENNIS MATCHES.  They were so distracting.  Ugh.   I kept glaring at them an di was like can you be quite  I bet they hate  me.   But at this point I don't really care.  Our coach even talked to there coach and he was like "Ok, we will be quite" then 5 minutes later they were loud  again!!          Hmm...

            You would so be dead.  Today is the worst day of my life.  Wel, it isn't. But today was pretty bad.  My last tennis game was today.   I really wanted/needed a win.  I put my heart, my soul, my everything into this game.  Then my partner screws up and we loose.  I have been crying ever since.   I can't hold it in.  Its not only this game... its the frusterations of this entire season.  All the sweat.  all the time.  All my everything.  I put it in to tennis.  I don't deserve to loose.  I have tried harder than anyone on my team.  I have shed more tears.  I have practiced.  I have spent so many hours.  I know I am better than this.  I don't deserve to be the worst.  Everyone on the team just thinks I am bad  But I am not.  sigh.  I wish I were dead.  I am going to go cry until there is not a single tear left in my eye..  until they turn as red as a skittle.  Then I am just going to lay in my bed and never get up.  Or maybe I will just die tomorrow.  Then everything would be better...

           A good charolote song. Which is quite unlke me but its a good song. Its called "Hold On"  I went to fred meyers tonight! It was ok. I got brie and crackers! yay.  Is Three Doors Down an okay band? Just wondering. I'm shopping at Itunes :) Lalla. I can't think of much to say except for the fact that I am disapointed in some guys these days. Like this really atractive guy at fred meyers. I would have stalked him BUT he had a hooters shirt on. I mean really. Thats disgusting. People these days..sometimes i just want to puke!  You guys have to never ever listen to 95.5, ok? At Itunes it has all the music charts for stations around us and like everysingle song they play on that station has explicet lyrics. I wonder if people ever get tired of hearing all that crap. It just seems to same kindda stuff to me "Baby, I love you" who cares? I mean really..if I cared about some famous persons love life I would read the magazine, not buy the cd. CD's are way to expensive anyways. And I  can just read the whole magazine in the store and not even buy it.  Some people say (like my mum) that I can never save any money and I alwaays spend it all. But that is totally not true. I do save money!!!! Just yesterday I have 68 whole dollars I saved. All those dollars were obviously gone by the end of today but still, I saved the money in the first place and because of that, I'm proud of ME!  And for the record, I am not bad at tennis. Everyone thinks that just because I am on the bottom that I stink at tennis. but I don't!!!! Everyone on my team is just really good.  An, I do kinda kinda KINDA like the song "Come Clean" because whenever it rained when I was little I would run outside in my little rain jacket and dance in the rain.  I reminded me of that CUTE girl in that car comercail where she is all lik e"Somedya, I will be walking down the asile" I love that girl. I just want to adopt her.  Ooh! This radio station in Phenoix has swichfoot at the #6 and #32 spots on its charts. What a dealio.  I can't think of anything to say and I am just going of rambling about things. haha. Its better this way. I am so sleepy I really need to work on my garden.  Ugh.  I don't want to go to schooool on monday. I think I might get sick for part of it ;)  I didn't get to go to a bookstore today so I don't have another copy of endurance. Ah! STUPID JONES SODA. Ugh. I am so increibly MAD.  Grr.  *weirdest thought of the day*  "Frankie Muniz has an album out, what the heck!"  Lalla. I must type until the day i die!  Which will obviously be MONDAY.  Hmm. They cheapest I can get a book off of amazon is 5 bucks. I don't wanna spend 5 bucks on this STUPID book.  In San Jose switchfoot is #4 and #8! wahhoo.  In San Diego switchfoot is #1!!!

            Hahahhahaha! I smelled like rotten milk! it was funn-knnee! So, right before I got my photo taken for the ID I had the grandest idea so make the funniest face ever. So they called my name and I stood by that sheety thing and he was like "smile and look at the lens" and I was like "Right...mwahhahaha!" So I made the BEST face ever it was like a shocked kinda look. It's hard to explain. I like made me eyes go really big. But then the picture taking guy was like "I don't think you will like this picture.." and he deleted it and made me re take my photo! I was like "I want to be ugly! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?!?" So then for my new picture he made me smile so I look normal.   *sigh*  Looking normal is overrated.

            Ok. So I am all packed, kinda. i keep packing then un packing. Hahah. I am a wreck.   This morning I went to this preschool/kindergarten where kids in low income homes. Most of there fathers are like abusive or not there.  All the kids were SO nice! They were like wya nicer then at a normal school. It was crazy. I mostly hung out with this girl named Jasmine and another girl named Tianna. they were so cool. But one time this girl tripped so I went to help her and she was like "My daddys in jail." so I was like "Oh..I am sorry.." then we said "My brothers hate me. They call me stupid, but i'm a GENIOUS! My mom calls me PRINCESS!" aww. She was cute.  It made me sad that I couldn't do more to help them. They were glad that we were there. It was a group of about 10 people from church. When we came they were like "THE TEENAGERS ARE HERE!" then like in the middle they were like "WE LOVEEEEE THE TEENAGERS!" haha. it made me laugh.   I leave in 14 hours for San Diego. Wooohoo!  But get this.  My passport is expired and my photo ID from school is MISSING. I am like frekaing out.  I better go look for it some more!  Bye!  laura fantora

See, people will think we look funny then laugh at us then the judges will be like "wow, they are funy! First prize! First prize!"  My second weapon is...see I am really shy just around people but when I get on the stage I am like BOOOOOOOM. and everyone is like "Wow!"  You know it.  Wow.  I am so nervous for the improvathon, I am like shaking and it's not till SATURDAY.  You all better say a prayer for me. Saturday, 3 o'clock.  Wow.

           Now I just have to wait 3 days. Well, actually only 2 full days.  I made a photo journal of me packing but it was slightly boring and I had a complaint that I posted to many photos [*cough*] So I chose not to post it.  Unless you all really want to see it or something, which is quite unlikely.  Packing was fun. It made me feel like this was all real, it is really happening.  I am going on an airplane without my family and I don't have to pay a single cent.  The plane is covered..Disneyland is covered..Food is provided...Our hotel is paid for.  My parents didn't even have to pay everything.  free vacations rock!  All my nervousness is gone. Everyone on my team is all like "What if I mess up??" [while on stage at the improvathon] and I am like "Doubtful. We rock!" we really do, we are really funny.  I wish I could figure out a site to host video  because then I would post one of our scenes.  They are pretty great.  Everyone at CYT thinks I am shy but then when I get on the stage they are all like "Whoa." because I go crazy.  Hmm.  We get to meet all the other teams! I bet there will be a guy on one of the teams and we will fall in love but we wont be able to marry each other since I am fourteen and he lives in Chicago. Maybe we could be pen pals.   [I'm not desperate, I swear,  I'm not!]

Then we went to goodwill and I got a costume for theatre camp. Haha.  it is the ugliest thing I have ever seen in my life, its GREAT!  I am gonna take a picture of it soon :)  Then I went to Fred Meyer and got some food to eat on the plane. Woohoo!  I got gardettos and circus animals! YAY!   Dude.  You knwo those plastic hair clips with the plastic bows that you used to wear when you were a little kid?   THE STOPPED CARYIN THEM AT FREDDYS!  I was SO mad. I wanted to wear them in my hair.

             hahahha. I have do this improv thing today. We were gonna practice and be funny but we were like "No thanks.." so we watched this really perverted movie. Haha. it was like from the 60s.  So what mainy happens is this one girls boy friends tries to make her jealous and starts making out with this fake blonde. So she gets mad and is like "i hate you" and falls in love with this old man.  yeah.  Hahhaha. So at this one point in the movie this guy picks up the main girl and she was like "Ahhh! Let me go!" and he like starts kissing her [i told you it was a sick movie!] and the old man with whom she falls in love with goes up to them both and he was like "Excuse me sir, but your molesting that girl."  I have no clue why but it was REALLY funny at the time.  Then we went to comedy sports. It was kidna akward though because it was just Me, Larry, and Heather...Larry and I volunteered for a game and they were like "What ar eyour names? and we were like "laura and larry" and they were like "Laura and larry.awwwww." and I was like "WHAT?  yeah...akwardness.  They gave us a gift certificate! wahoooo   now I am NERVOUS.  but guess what!  Larry and Heather don't like scary rides either!  And get this: Larry's favorite ride is the TEACUPS! YES!  But now I am really nervous about the competition. What if we get out in the first round?? That would suck.    Hmmm.....   YEAH!!  lallalala.  I just had another soda.  I am kidna addicted...  But I guess that is all, I will probably post something inspiriing around midnight ;)

            Did I tell you my dad is going to Indiana tomorrow for a DAY?? What a waste of money. My grandparents are getting this special "long time service" award from the First Church of God and my grandpa insisted my mum and dad go. But my mom didn't want to so somehow she got out of it. I WANNA got to indiana for a day!!!! My grandpa is paying for it all and everything.  Did I tell you he wrote a book? It is like 400 pages long and he just got them back from the printer place. I should take a picture of it. I am expected to read it. Yuck!!!!!  I hate reading books when I am forced.  You know what it is called.."My Life Story"  I mean if you are going to write 400 pages about your life it might as well be called like "My Journey Through Time" or something.  :)

            That I love you?  I think that is a song..Mandy would probably know! :) Like Heather is knower of all movies, mandy is knower of all music.   I was just going to say that it is amazing how you all care so much [at least I tink to do *smile*] about me that you want to read alllll these words about what I do everyday, it means a lot..it really does.  just because I am in this bible mode, I thought I would post a verse that I liked...  Mathew 11:11 I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  Isn't that simply amazing????  See, John the Baptist is one of the most famous disiples in the Bible. yet, I who am practicaly nothing can still do more amazing things that John. He who is least can be greater than him!  Even though you may seem like a small person who can't do anything special, you are greater than John!!  You can do amazing things.  I love jesus...that may seem like an odd thing to say but I truley do.  He rocks my world!  :)

            I just got back from church...  [story time]  When I got there the music began..we were all singing together, as one. Then something caught my eye. There was a person in the row next to us. He looked pretty average. Short brown hair. Two earrings in his left year..he was wearing a white t-shirt, a baseball cap, and khaki shorts. But something was different about him. In stead of standing in "reverent" stillness he was dancing. Not just swaying the the beat, he was really dancing. He was jumping up and down, swaying his arms, and singing as loud as his vocal chords could muster.  At first no one seemed to notice. But, one by one, people started staring. Some even glared.  This should not be something unusual at church. Church should be a play to go crazy for God. Not a place to stand still, a place to dance for joy. Not a place to glare or stare, a place to welcome everyone into the family of God.   This is what drives me crazy.  People go to church and judge everyone.   The church is not a place to judge, the church is a place to welcome.  Not just the people you would feel comfortable around...EVERYONE!

            I have one invite left so if anyone wants it just leave a comment.  Well today is saturday. It has been an okay day.  I woke up at 10 then played the computer for like two hours. Then I went and took a REALLY long shower! Woohoo! Then I blow dryed my hair and painted my nails bright pink! Haha! My nails are getting really long! I used to bite my nails so this is a huge achievement for me. :) Grr! I can never think of anything to say anymore :(  Adios amigos!

            Why, hello! Fancy meeting you here! How are you doing? I am very well, thanks. Oh nothing, I am going to church later tonight.   Wow. That was interesting. I love making conversations with myself...   Alrighty then.  That was a really awkward start to a blog post....  Today it was supposed to rain..but it's really sunny! I don't get it!!  wow.  I am never starting a blog post like that again, I have run out of things to say..and that's unusual!

            It's kind of sad how I will never be able to play tennis again...well I guess I could go play at Prarie some day during the summer..but I don't really to anymore. Good thing I didn't buy a shiny new raquet like I was going to.  But..one door closed, another opened. It is 12:19 AM. Late nights like this always push me into deep thought.  I am trying to get my parents to adopt a child, wouldn't that be cool? My mumsy was like "You probably wont get as much new clothes anymore..." and I was like "So?" I would rather help someone then get stupid clothes that make me look pretty. I mean seriously. I do love clothes...but it's and addiction I am trying to stop.  I do all these things to make my fit in or make me popular.  Like buying 70 dollar jeans..20 dollar lip glosses. But nothing like that will ever make me happy. It's just a trap I keep fallling into.  My sister always makes fun of me because I go into these huge speeches everyday abotu the evils of modern society. Like a couple days ago I did a speech of how some people buy clothes and they find there confidence in having expensive clothes. I was "like There are a couple people I know who only think they are cool because they have nice clothes. When you put them in wally world pants they would think they were ugly and become insecure. This is why the world is so horrible. People cannot find confidence in themselves, just what they have."  Then I went into nordstrom and buy all these clothes and my sister was like "Uh...laura, I thought you said people should do stuff like that?" and I was like "uhh..." I am such a double crossing two face jerk.  hah!  I love mocking myself.  See, what I think is that it's best to know your faults so you can change them. :)  but I don't want to be normal...I don't want to go through life just being Laura.  I want to be FANTORA THE GREAT!  Well not even that.  I just want to be Laura who tried to do good things, sometimes those things didn't turn out good but she helped out a long the way.  I could even be the girl who tried so many times to do wonderful things but they never worked out.  I would rather die trying then die sitting on a chair staring at the glare from the computer screen.  Kind of like what I am doing at this very moment.  Just peachy.  Hmm...I will post more thoughts later but I am to exhausted...

            Hahhahahaha. I am SO stinking hyper. Oh my gooodness. I think I drank one to many sodas.  Today I ran errends with my mumsy. We went to to this brick place and got some brick then we went to nordstrom. Haha. We got to that store WAY to much. Oh my gooodness.   Then we went to the PLASTIC SURGEONS! Hahahhahahhahaha. It was SO sick. They were showing videos of breast agmuntations and I wa slike oh my gosh...this is SO gross. The reason I was going to the plastic surgeons office to get my brothers stiches removed...see, when matt got stiches there was a huge line at the emergency room so they went to Dr. Workmans because he is our friend. One time we were at my grandmas christmas  party and I was watching the news with them and connie chung or whatever was on and he was like "Wow, she just got an eye lift." hahha. It was funny. so he gave my brother stiches for free because my dad gave him an architectual consoltation (wow that was hard to spell!)   So after we got his stiches out we went to the new Bostons Pizza and had dinner. My spanish tutor works there! She is SO cool! I wanna be exactly like her. :) She is moving to mexico soon to be a missionary, isn't that coool?  In a bit the Brands are coming over to watch a movie so that should be interesting. In case you don't know who they are they are from our old church. They have a daughter named Hannah who is my age.  They are cool :)

            I think I am going to puke.  I don't wanna go to San Diego. Waaaaa. What if i'm not funny?!   Blehhh.  You know what.  I have been thinking a lot recently about everything. [i got anew journal!] and I haven't done anything really good this summer. not one thing. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING. That is what summers are for!! Doing good things for others. I don't want to waste my three months sleeping in till 11 everyday. I would wake up, september 6 with only one day of summer leftand I would relaize how I wasted all the free days God gave me. That would really suck. It seems like I can never do anything good. I can never change anyones life..I can't do this..I can't do that..  Hmm. I wish I could just be somebody, somebody important. Maybe I want that for all the wrong reasons. Maybe I just want to make myself look good...i guess i just want everyone to look up to me and be like "Look! there is Laura, she is an amazing person, she changed the world"  *sigh*

            I was them on the TV tonight! Oh my goodness. I am offically going to learn how to play the fiddle. It is SOOO cool! but the problem is, if I play the fiddle in my band everyone will think I am copying yellow card and that would suck.  I am marrying the fiddle player...or the blonde guitarist.  I also saw the hives! They were good..but at times the lead singer acted a little gay so I was like "Hmm" they had the cutest suits ever!!!   Yup.. I guess that's all :)

            I'm exhausted!! I was super bored so I decided to become a fitness teacher and teach my sister the basics of healthy living. It was fun!! We played tag but the catch was you had to stay on this path that lead in a circle so we were just chasing eachother around in circles! Haha. The I made her push an ice cube accross the carpet with her nose! Hahhaa. Then she had to pick up the cube with her toe and bounce accross the carpet. Haha. It was so much fun. Then we did streches...they kinda hurt!! I made her spin her arms around in circles like 50 times. Haha. It was so fun!  I am in such å weird mood!  Whoa look at that a! COOL!

            Baby sit! Yuck. I just got done cleaning the hosue when my neighbor calls and was like "Can you baby sit tonight from 7-10?" and I was like "Ok!" because any oppurtunity to make money is well worth the pain. One of the kids is named "Lincoln"  :) I can tell right now he is going to be like the most popular boy in high school. He has diry blonde hair and blue eyes. Even though he is only 1 years old, he is going to be a pretty boy. :) 16 years in the future, correct me if I am wrong. :)  The second of the two children is named Lanie. She always makes me laugh. one time we played house and she named her husband "Spider Man" it was funny :)  She is obessed with disney land. She is always like "Lets go to Disney land!!" and I am like "But....it's in california!" "Noooooooo!! we are gonna pretend!" :)  Last time I baby sat them Lincoln would not stop crying. It was soo messed up. I did every single thing to try to get him to be quite but he wouldn't! Then at his bed time I put him in bed and he just fell right asleep..I was like, "grrrr... why didn't I do this sooner?"  Kids...ay yi yi!  I am never ever having children, to much work!!  I would rather live by myself in a flat in London. :)

Today was pretty fun!!  My mum, my sister and I went shopping for paint to color the exterior of our house! It was SO fun! I stole like 200 of those paint chip thingys and my mum got me double sided tape so I can plaster my walls with them! Hahaha!   Then I went home for a bit. AFter I like blow dryed my hair (it was fun!) we went to a CYT picnic. It was pretty fun! My friend Jauclin was there! woot woot! But then Jenny got in like  a pixie stick fight with Lauclin and ended up pouring a whole pixie stick in my hair. It was sad... :)   Do you think I should be in HYPE next year?  Its like High School Youth Pursuiting Excelence. It's a CYT thing. Yoou have to go to meetings and stuff.  yeah.. Lallalalallala

            Oh my gooodness!! I had the best time EVER!! mwa hahah!  Ok...so at 5:00 people came and we just kinda hung around..then we took a walk to the creek and then we laid in the hamock. Then at 6 we had a picnic dinner! It was sooo goood!! We had tereaki chicken, rice, potstickers, and water mellon! woot woot!!  Then we started our first movie which was kinda stupid..it had Audrey Hepburn (i have nooo clue how to spell that!) and gregory peck. Then we went up to my muyms rooms and watched the funnest/weirdest movie EVER. It was called "Atack of the Killer Tomatoes" It was SOOOOOOO funny. Oh my goodness. We decied our new tradition was to watch that movie and every party. It was great! During all this we were eating cream puffs, jelly bellys, and "fat boy" ice cream sandwhiches. Hahhahaha. Affter the movies were over we went in the tent and laid and talked until about 11. Then we were like "Lets go look at the stars!!!" So we laid in the grass for about 45 minutes just staring at the stars and talking.   All of the sudden Heather was like "LETS GO ROLL DOWN HILLS!!" so we were like "OKKK!!!" So we got into our sleeping bags and went to my back yard. We had the best and biggest hill for rolling down!!! It was like pitch dark so we couldn't see anythign and we kept running into eachother! It was SOOOOo awesome!! Thge hill just kept going and going and going!!!   Then my laid back down on the grass and looked at the stars! I saw a shooting star!! It  was SO pretty! We like found pictures and sutff in the stars! woot woot!  Then we are really tired and to lazy to go back in the tent so we just slept on the ground. It was kinda uncomfortable... :)  I woke up at about 5 and there were bugs all over me! It was SOO sick!! So I was like, I HATE BUGS! So I ran inside and slept on the couch, leaving my wonderful friends to fend for themselves. (I am a super hostess!!)  Then after a bit they all woke up and we ate breakfast.   At 10:00 Johanna had to leave, which was sad :(  At 10:30 we went to my grandpas house thing and played tennis on their super nice tennis court! it was AWESOME! haha. Heather and I  beat Emily and Sara twice! Mwa haha! One time I hit a ball really high and it landed in the pool! Haha. It was sooo funny! It made a big splash, I laughed.  Then we decided to go swimming. But, Emily forgot her swim suit!! :( So Heather, Sara, and I swam while poor Emily had to stick her feet it. It was a nice pool!! At first it was kinda cold but then it got warmer after I was used to it. We played marco polo and I just sat on the top stair so no one would catch me. Mwa haha!  After a bit we went in the hot tub which was SUPER nice! It was  like the perfect temperature!!!!  Then we got hungry so we ate and went home.  That my friends is the story of my fabulous day! :)

           "PEPSI SMASH" VOTING  Due to an error in the coding of votes processed by The WB's website(http://www.TheWB.com) during last night's broadcast of "Pepsi Smash," the winner of the "Smash Off" was incorrectly announced at the end of the broadcast on both coasts as Sugarcult, a Fearless/Artemis recording artist.   The correct winner of the "Smash Off," voted by viewers of "Pepsi Smash" across the country with winners announced in both eastern and pacific time zones, was in fact, Columbia Records recording artist, Switchfoot, who performed "Dare You to Move" during the "Smash Off."  Switchfoot also performed their hit single "Meant to Live" during the broadcast.   The WB regrets the error and congratulates Switchfoot as the winner of this week's "Pepsi Smash Smash Off." Additionally, the error will be corrected during the Sunday June 20, 2004 "EasyView" broadcast of "Pepsi Smash" (5:00-5:30 ET/PT).        *woot*  I GET TO SEE SWITCHFOOT TOMORROW!!!  woot woot

I am never getting married, I mean really, I don't want my husband to kill me. ;)  Just kidding, I can't wait till me wedding.  it will be fun! I don't really want to get married but I want to have the wedding! My wedding is gonna be hugeeeee. It will be great! You are all invited! :)  Tonight is quite boring. My brothers are loading the van so they can leave first thing tomorrow morning.  We (mum, dad, Hannah, and I) will have to drive my grandpas jaguar. Sad ;) I am quite excited though.   But tomorrow I have to go to church..With braces. Whenever I go anywhere in public I am SO insecure. I have never been this insecure in my life. Its disgusting.  *sigh*  But I get to go shopping in Portland for a swim suit...and maybe summer clothes..but I haven't found any goood summer clothes..so who knows :)  I need a fathers day gift too..hmm. My funds are quickly depleting!

            Its almost time for dinner!! I am quite hungry. My dad is barbecuing! wahooo! He is cooking me a burger and a sausage!!!!!!! I am quite hungry.  I laid half of the brick in my garden.  Fun stuff.  But it was so hot and I didn't drink enough water so I started to get really dizzy, my legs started shaking, and my vision started blacking out so I had to go back inside. I am like the worst during heat. Haha. I hate it!!  La de do.  I am starting to get used to my braces, which is nice. Every hour I resemble a beaver  less  and more like Laura.

            *whew*  I have bene working on my garden for the past hour.  I am stupid that way..its 3:00 the hotest part of the day...on the hottest day of the year and I am outside working away! :)  It was alright though.  I got to drive the lawn mower! We have this thing where we hook up a trailer to our mower..it was coool. So I got my dad to put the trailer on the mower and I loaded about a hundred bricks into the trailer. Then I drove the mower to my garden and unloaded them.  But there was one problem..the place where the bricks were stacked was like a bug hotel. It was disgusting. Bugs where flying everywhere.  I even found a bee nest in one brick!  yuck.  I hate bugs!  After I was done stacking the bricks I dug more of the pathway where I am going to lay the bricks. Now I am already to lay my pathway!! On sunday my mom is taking me to lawn and garden land to buy all my plants!!! *woot*  I am quite excited.  :)

           This is my 500th post in this blog! HOW EXCITING!  To commemorate I took a picture of me with braces.     Hah! You can't even see the braces..I fooled you! Well, I didn't really fool you because I took that picture like 5 minutes ago..but you thought you would see braces. I told you they are hard to spot..from far away. From closer up I look like a beaver. At least I am a cute beaver!!! Just kidding...I told my mom I looked like a beaver and she was like "NO YOU DON'T!" She is always trying to make me feel better btu you can kinda tell she is lying right through her teeth.  Acctually...now that I examine the photo you can see my braces... never mind... :)  I took a lot of medicene so I am allll better! Well, kinda. I brushed my teeth and did this floride thing.  Yup. I ate bread!! but I couldn't eat the crust because it was french bread so it was really hard.  Emily got sick so she can't come over today. :( Isn't that sad?? I think I am going to get my mom to take me to portland. She said if I could survive braces she would take me there on Saturday..but i want ot go now :)  Dude!  Tomorrow my two brothers are going on a raod trip to California! Isn't that fun?! They are going to surf and stuff like real californians. How wonderful. I really wanted to go but my mom was like "NO!" They are going to sleep in the car and stuff because they can't afford to pay for a hotel. Haha. But I think they are staying one night with my cousin, Breanna, who lives in Pasadena.  How FUN!  And i am going to be stuck at my boring home doing boring things. Waa stinking hoo. :) I like saying that. Hahah. It makes me smile.  When we all graduate we are going on a road trip to Tiajuna (i can't spell that. Haha) Sara, Heather, and I decided this at the ape caves. We are going to steal a bus (Haha!) and paint it pink  (Heathers idea... haha) and renaim it the party  bus. Haha. Sara is going to drive it down there because she said she could pull many all nighters while at the wheel. This will be fun. We can use our mad spanish skills. Hahaha. right... :)   Talk to you all later!!  Sincerely,  Laura Fantora

            I just brushed and flossed. Ow. This is the only thing that has hurt so far about braces. OOOOW! Hahha. It hurts really really bad. They gave me this special tool to floss with and it hurts and it takes a really long time. Considering I hate flossing to being with, I doubt I will be able to floss a lot without dying. :)  I hate braces. My ortho person said I didn't really need them but later in life my teeth would start to break. My mom was like "Ahh! You must have braces!" My teeth look fine I don't need these horrible things in my mouth.   On the plus side, I was able to eat!!! With my spacers I couldn't eat at all for like 2 days, not fun.

I wwas quite sad. Sugarcult beat them. I had never heard of them until tonight. They were pretyy good too, but switchfoot was BETTER!  Today I tried to make lemon squares but I beat the eggs to long and a thing merguine formed on the top. It was kinda nasty...but oh well :)

            Today was a  pretty good day. Except I got braces..but its OK! Haha. I guess. I have deicded that I look like a BEAVER. Not a rabbit like I said earlier.  Today I went to fred myer and bought this really good smelling shaving cream. Its like melon or something. I got Bed Head after party!! Wooohooooo!!!!!!! I have been wanting it for a long time, it smells super goood and it has cool packaging. :) The last thing I got was some dove shampoo. :)  There were so many people my age at the store it was kinda creepy. Summer scares me sometimes. I mean really, why do teenagers have to wander around the town all day...why cna't they be computer addicts like me?  I was going to finish my garden stuff today but it's WAYYY to hot!  I mean really, I cannot work under these conditions! It's like 90. TO HOT!! I wish it was 80. The perfect temperature. Or 78  ;)   You know what.  I seem to have lost all my confidence. I used to be this really confident person but now I feel like a blob of uselessness. Isn't that sad? I think it is.   I mean for improv you need confidence. If your not confident your scene is gonna suck. And I have my big competition soon. Waaa.  But oh well. I will get over it. Its these stupid braces.  They are cutting up my lip. :o

            Sad. Well here is my final photo without braces. As you see, I am quite happy. ;)      But, I decided that I am never going to stop smilling, even if I do have braces.  Tonight has been kind of boring. I cleaned the house from 4-6 then I ate dinner. We had greek salad. I don't really like salad! It was pretty good though because it had cucumbers in it and I love cucumbers!!! My mom also cooked yummy bread!  Now I am just wandering around aimlessly waiting for tomorrow...lalala.  It wont be all that bad. :)  At first it will be bad but by sunday, it will all be better!  Speaking of sunday...I am going to Sara's soccer game on sunday! Woohooo!  Then on friday emily is coming over! Wooohoo!  Later Gators.  Your friend forever,  Laura Fantora

My sister has been crying all day because she says she is ugly. Isn't that sad? I wish I was ugly for her and she was the prettiest girl in school.  What can I do?

            Hahhahahha. I am incredibly HAPPY. Mwa hahahahha!!!!!!!! I don't know why. Happy happy joy joy. Probably because I stayed up really late last night wriitng and reading my bible. Such joy I feel! :)  I will never be sad again. Now that God is on my side. Mwa haha!  I don't know...but with God I just feel powerful.  Anywho.  I went to my grandmas birthday which was interesting.  My aunt cooked the food it was quite tasty. I love my aunt. She welds glass! You should check out her website: http://www.sharonagnor.com/    Have I told you how the Improvathon is in 17 days and I HAVE LOST MY FUNNY. Ah!!! I am totally not funny anymore. Like not funny at all. I think everyone on my team is suffering from lack of funniness.  From sunday-tuesday we were together for 15 hours. WAY TO MUCH!!!!!!  I am getting sick of them. Hahha. But I still love 'em. Its gonna be scary to be on a plane with them. Haha. And at Disneyland. The funny thing is, i'm not afraid of messing up at the competition I am just afraid of DISNEYLAND. I have like a ride-o-phobia. They freak me out. I can do the tea cups and small world, but thats it!  :)  Talk to you all later!   Laura Fantora

It makes me want to cry.  Why don't you like me?  You said I thought I was perfect  I don't think that  I never have.  Please listen.  I may not trust you.  But we were such good friends  What happened?   I shall never know.  But I know I still love you.  No matter what.   I will never hate you.

           Today is a reallly weird day.  So we went to the ape caves and that a was not really fun. Emily and I just walked around together and we were walking really slow. Somehow Taylor, Eric, and Marc ended up following us the whole way back. Taylor was lke treating them like her slaves. I felt really bad for M+E I was like come han gout with us! But we obviously aren't good enough for them. :)  So emily and I got tired of the hwole cave thing so we went and sat in the bus. Emily told Taylor that she ate  meat (they were seeing who could last the longest and emily won, but she cheated!) and Taylor was like "I HATE YOU!" and we were like "Want to tell us something new, JERK" well we didn't say that. We just left and went to go find Heather and the rest of the gang. I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THEM. Always looking down on me like I am inferior. I must calm down. School is ending soon.   Then everyone got back on the bus and we went to this other hiking place but Heather, Sara, Emily, and I stayed in the bus and played cards. I lost!   Then everyone got back on the bus and it was all jolly. But taylor will NOT STOP flirting with my eric and marc. I am like Taylor, you know what. YOUR NOT THAT ATRACTIVE. Wow. That was really mean. Sorry, I am just a little mad.  At one point during the bus ride I was looking at eric and eric turned around and smiled at me so I knew it was okay. He doesn't like taylor.  Then when we arrived home by brother was like "Guess what" and we took off his beanie and I was like "OH MY GOSH. WE ARE TAKING YOU TO THE HOSPITAL" as it turns out he ran into a piece of rock sticking out of the cave and like got knocked out. He said blood was pooring everywhere. Thankfully, his boy scout friend had a first aid kit (those boy scouts!) which him and he wrapped gauze around his head. My brother didn't tell anyone! So he was walking around everywhere bleeding. Geez. The gauze was like soaked with blood.   Then I had improv and I was too tired to be funny.  My brother is getting stiches right now. :o  Those HURT!

          I had improv practice, which was ok. But it lasted till 8 so I couldn't go to Sara's house :( waaaaaaaaaaaaa..   Then the parents came to watch and all my mom did was like critize and I was like mom, just go away.  But yeah.  Lallalala.  Oh! We have a two hour layover in San Jose so I was like "Ooh!! Mandy can come and visit!" but then my mom was like she can't get past security. But we could still like..i dunno. I could go out of security then come back in or something. Haha.

            Fresh breezes blow past my face I feel free I feel fresh  Its time to begin a new day Full of adventure Full of grace  Its a sunny day It seems as thought it will never end. It seems like I could be here forever  Here, under a towering tree Never tire of your breeze. Never tire of your adventures  Because its Summer. Everday to make the best of. Everyday filled with your love.  I have never felt this way. I feel like I can fly. I feel as if your sun is calling to me.  It slowly speaks to me Telling me to run. Telling me to jump.   Because everyday  Is fresh It is clean  Under the sun...

            Tody is like the most peaceful day ever. Its great! I woke up at 11 then I took like an hour long shower. It was great!! I got to use my new conditioner. Its so cool! Its like Dove extra volume and its in a can and it comes out FOAMY! It rocks. I think someone is using my shaving cream. Haha. Its like almost gone and I just bought it!   Then I blow dryed my hair and made it look pretty. Then I put on make-up which was fun. I don't know why but I love to put on make-up. Then I watched the olympic diving trials. Those are so cool! I wish I could dive like that. Its simply amazing.  I love the olympics, so fun!! :)  Now I am just being lazy and sitting. I love it!  I haven't been able to realy relax for a really long time. I am always so busy with school and life.   Even though it hasn't really started, I never want summer to end.

           Today was my last day of real school. It was ok. I got 100% on my spanish final! How happy. But, I am getting a 92.7! UGHHHH. If I was getting .3 more I would be getting a real A! Waaaaaa. *sad* If only I would have studied a little more for my last test. I am filled with these "if onlys" But, I didn't try hard enough so I guess its my fault.  The grades I know for sure of right now are: PE: A Preforming Arts: A Spanish: A- English: A  Thats all I am sure of right now, so I guess thats pretty good.  But I could have done so much better than I did this semester. I just didn't try hard enough.  *sighhh*  We have a ton of people coming over in  a half an hour so the whole house has to be absolutely perfect. Its kinda annoying. I can't do anything!!!  We went to nordstrom today. I tried on a ton of stuff that was on sale but I ended up buy stuff that wasn't on sale. Haha. This always happens! I tried on a really cute skirt but my mom said it was to short. "no me gusta la moda de faldas cortos"   (I don't like the fashion of short skirts!)  I also got some really cute MAC lip stick! The lady at the counter was like "Oh! it looks so prettty!" And it does...I was just staring at myself in the mirror and I was like "why do I get pretty the last day of school?" It always works that way, but its all good. I got a really cute pink tank top with a little flower on it. :)  I saw one of my orthodontist helper persons at the mall. It was scary! She probably knew I swallowed one of my spacers, they are scary like that.

Hah.]  I can't think of what to say so I am gonna complain for like 50 billion hours, enjoy. ;)  Lauren stole my sweater. She got to the half yearly sale before me and bought the sweater I was gonna buy. Waa. It looks better on me. I think I might buy it anyways because its not like I am ever gonna see her again. Mwa hah!  I forget my english paper. Grr!!! I was mad,but its ok.  Today was my last science and english periods of the year! YAY!  Tomorrow I have a history final. Yuck!!!!!!! And a Spanish final but I heard its just a crossword puzzle! Haha   Lallala. I get to go to nordstroms tomorrow!  Guess what. I owe 21 dollars for my year book! Grr!! and we wont even get them until the 28 of JULY. Sad... :(  I can't think of anyother stupid things in my life right now.  Oh wait i can! Hahhaa  I am being replaced by nick...   But this has been a relly good day!  the science final was EASY!  but then we had to watch this sick science moving. It was like all about how sharks mate in great detail. It was so disgusting, I thought I was gonna puke!

            When the weathers fine. I'm gonna hitch a ride out of this old town... I think that's a Jack Johnson song, but I can't remember.  Guess what.  I was going to spend all summer at church like a good little girl, but I officially decided not too and I haven't told anyone except for you, blogger.  See, this sounds awfully disrespectful, but I don't have enough time for church.  I want to maybe spend time with my friends? Or maybe not. They probably wouldn't invite me anyways.  I am glad Karsen invited me to her house. Even though I can't go, it meant alot to mean. I haven't been invited to spend the night at someones house for..goll, a year? Thats really sad. I can't remember the last time I spent the night at someones house. Oh...I think it was halloween at heathers.  I wish I was in my old house cuz then I would have a huge part and invite everyone but my hosue is too small.  *siiighhhh*

            I despise finals. I don't even know why they are having them. They have never had 'em before!! Then like a week before finals they are like "Guess what! Finals!" UGH. I studied for over 3 hours for science today and I think I am going to die.  You know how I REALLY wanted to go to the half yearly sale today?? Two people in my family went on two seperate occasions today and no one even told me! I am so mad.  So my mom promised to take me on Friday...which isn't a promise she will probably keep or anything but at least she tries. *rolls eyes*  I am in such a crappy mood, sorry.  I was like "I don't get this science at all." and my brother was like "really? I got perfect on that test and I didn't even have to study! Hah!" So he was just making fun of me because I am stupid so I was like crying and quite sad and I was like "I am not good at anything,Matt is always better than me" and my mom was like "no he isn't!" And I was like tell me one time I was better than him and my mom said "Uh...at least your nice." and I was like Thanks mom, that sure helps.   Grr..  Then my mom was like "Do you even want me to help you study? You are in such a  bad attitude." And i waslike "Well, I don't want to study." and she was like "Fine! Study by yourself."  Okayyy....

            I went to church today! Yay! I saw Beka!! YAY!!  Dude.  She is coming to my house.   TONIGHT!  to MY house!!!  I should clean.   On a side note.... Mark 6:17-29 For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.  Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.  The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."  She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"  "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.  At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."  The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.   A nice happy story, eh? [ I am going to anylize this is parts... what I say I will start with one of these cute "-" things. Got it? Good.]  For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."  -See, as the story goes... Herod had this nice wife and everything was happy. Until he saw Hereodias. [She was also his neice!!] Since he was king and all he was like "Why can't shebe my wife?" so he took her away from her husband, divorced his wife, and married Herodias.  John saw all this crap and, obviously, was like "This is not right!" So he vocalized his opinion, losing the favor of Herodias.-   So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled ; yet he liked to listen to him.   -But Herod still liked him!! [another thing, grudges are dumb! Just forgive and forget.]-  Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests.   -When they say "dance" this isn't like the twist or something. This was a vulgar sensual dance. Obiously, the men were "pleased"-  The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you." And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."  She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?"  "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.  At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."   -So, the always loving mother, Herodias uses her daughters sensuality to get exactly what she wants. Nice mom.-  The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.  -The king was distressed!! See, he liked John the Baptist. But, because of his guests he crumbled in and agreed. This is an example of peer presure. Usually, you see peer pressure in less harmful ways but it can be this bad.-  So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.   So there goes the greatest disiple man of all time.. [Matthew 11:11 I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.] all that because of peer pressure.  let me tell you, as Christians we CANNOT be people pleasers.  People aren't going to like us, thats just the truth. Deal with it!  A want of social approval will just lead you to disgrace.  Who would you rather be? John the Baptist, who wasn't liked by many and who got his head cut off BUT lived totally for God and changed a ton of peoples lifes.... or Herod who always tried to please people and ended up lived a miserable life and hurting a lot of people.  It's your choice.  Jesus wasn't liked my many...I wont be liked by many either.

            It's 3:33!!! Hahahaha! That's the greatest thing ever.  So today I woke up at 8 and I went to my brother best friends house. haha. they are moving to Yakima [the middle of NOWHERE!!] so I helped 'em move. There were all these random guys there. It was weird. tehre was this one guy there and his name was Kyle and I could not figure out his age. It was so weird. Liek when I first looked at him I though he was like 15..but when he talked he looked like he was liked 18. Cuh-razy!! For most of the time my mom and I packed boxes. I got the BEST job of them all. I got to label the boxes!! I drew pretty pictures all over the boxes/ Like for a box of purses and aprons I put "Pretty Purses and Angry Aprons" and ont he box the drew a bunch of smiling purses. they were totally blonde they were like "Woohoo! Moving is fun!" then I drew angry aprons who said stuff like "GET ME OUT OF THIS BOX!" it was great.  I hope they like it in Yakima! They are going to be working at this place called the "Flying H Ranch" it's where toubled teenage boys go. I think they will be able to serve a lot and enjoy it.  Fun stuff!!  Taylor from CYT called and my first HYPE meeting is on Wednesday!! Isn't that exciting? It's a barbeque and there is going to be a pool there. Which is kinda dumb because I hate to siwm but oh well, it will be fun! Bekah will be there WOOOHOO!! Haha. Exciting times.  I think when I get home I will probably "preach it" but you all are probably sick of my pages and pages of "inspiration"   Adios Amigos!  laura Fantora

            So, I woke up this morning at 9 and my mom was like "let's go shopping!!" so I was like "okay..."  I got in the shower and took a nice, warm, long shower. Then we were off.  We went to this yummy bento place by PSU. I got teryaki chicken and STICKY RICE! The rice was SO gooood! I wuv rice.  Then we went to 23rd and looked around. We went to urban outfitters and I got this awesome shirt for Beka!!! It says "Mini-Van, Mega Fun!" and it has a picture of a mini van on it. It rocks!! Then, for me, I got this great shirt that says "Have Fun. Be Fit. Aerobicize!!" it's great. It has this fun-knee picture of this workout lady. Haha. I finally found something to ask for fur my birthday!! My mom keeps bugging me about what to get me for my birthday. I told her to get me this awesome hat. It's kinda hard to explain. But it's cool. And, I will be able to wear it to school because hats are not against the dress code anymore!! Mwa haha!  Then we just kinda wandered for awhile. Ohh wait! We went to three monkeys. I don't usually like anything at that store. it's all kinda cheaply made..but today I found an awesome messenger bag!! I got it for school! Its pretty. I should take a picture of it.  Then we went downtown and wandered more. Then we went to whole foods and got some..well..foood! Yay!  And that was the end of my shopping trip.   Funnnn stuff.  Now I am home and my sister is bound to be back from camp any minute. Sad. Oh well.

            Sorry about my "fit of rage" last night. I was feeling sick and tired.  last night turned out to be good though. I got to read my bible and talk to Papa God.  I really missed him on my trip to the beach. I forgot to bring my bible. :( I discovered how much I need God to be a good person. Like when I wasn't close to him I was this disgusting, awful person. I never want to be around me when I am far away from God.  I think today we are going to help my moms friend move.  I finally bought the Inhabited cd!!!! I also bought this awesome shirt!! It says "I hate meatloaf" Hahahahaha.  I am so excited.  I hope it comes in the mail  soon!  When I continue on my path of inspiration I shall tell you all about it.  Yours until we meet again,  Laura  P.S. Have you noticed that since I started being "inspirational" all my friends have joined in? Haha!

            very mad.  i am mad at everything.  i don't know what to do...  Why can't we just be one in this world? Why are there so many groups? So many categories?  Psalm 4:4  In your anger do not sin;  when you are on your beds,  search your hearts and be silent.    I think I am going to go lay on my bed and ponder my existence. Be ready for gargantuous posts tomorrow.

            I should go to bed, but I don't wanna! I just want to sit here and ponder eternity. I read today in the paper they are realeasing a new edition of the book of mormon. Haha. How many is this? Number 4,001? At worldview they told us how over 4,000 "corections" have been made to the Book of Mormon. It makes me so sad that the people involved in Mormonism don't realize how false there religion is. I mean really. I would hate to be a Mormon girl. Your husband like rules your life. When he dies, and if he lived a good enough life, he choses wether to take you to his planet or not. Geez.   It seems like all the other religions in this world, beside Christianity, live with the idea that YOU have to be good enough to get into heaven. You have to do this, you have to do that. But really, God is the only way we can ever hope to get into heaven. It isn't based on anything we ever did or will be able to do. God just loves us.  What an amazing guy. I can only hope to be a fragment of what he is. I want to be good like Jesus, but alas, I am a rotten person and I will never be like Jesus. But the reason Jesus came wasn't to be like "Hah! I didn't sin! But your a sinner, YOUR GOING TO BURN IN HELL!" He came for ME!  And youuuuu!!   Well...  yeah.  Hahah I just go on these huge rants and I can't stop typing but then I just run out of things to say.  Casting Crowns - Who Am I From the album Casting Crowns   Who am I, that the Lord of all the earth Would care to know my name Would care to feel my hurt Who am I, that the Bright and Morning Star Would choose to light the way For my ever wandering heart  Not because of who I am But because of what You've done Not because of what I've done But because of who You're   Chorus: I am a flower quickly fading Here today and gone tomorrow A wave tossed in the ocean A vapor in the wind Still You hear me when I'm calling Lord, You catch me when I'm falling And You've told me who I am I am Yours, I am Yours  Who Am I, that the eyes that see my sin Would look on me with love and watch me rise again Who Am I, that the voice that calmed the sea Would call out through the rain And calm the storm in me  I am Yours Whom shall I fear Whom shall I fear 'Cause I am Yours I am Yours  It just seems SO amazing that I am this microscopic dot in the universe and God choose to care about me. he knows my NAME!   I thought it was amazing when Trish [the lead singer of Superchic[k] ] would call me by name at concerts. But, get this, the king of the universe knows my name!!! that's like George bush knowing everyone in this countries name.  Acctually, it's way more amazing than that.  It's like presdent bush knowing everyone in this country by name and being best friends with everyone.  It's even more amazing that that!!  God knows every who has EVER lived on this earth. And he doens't even just know our names, he knows everything about us. He knows everything we have ever done and he knows everything we will do!  I just can't stop being amazed at that.  Wow!  Matthew 10:30 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.   He even knows how many hairs I have on my head!!! Hahhaha. I would even know how many hairs i had if I counted for days!!!!  Wow.  GOD ROCKS!!   Wowowoowowow!  Sorry I am having a "God Moment"  Romans 8:38-39 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[1] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.    NOTHING can separate us from Gods love!!!  So, if I moved 3,000 miles away from my best friend and I refused to call her, write her, e-mail her, and have any correspondance with her, wouldn't our friendship end?! I think so!! But God never will leave you. If you be a jerk he wont get all mad and be like "She hurt me, I don't want to talk to her ever again!" GOD LOVES YOU! Haha! No matter how stupid I can get God still loves me and he will always want to be my friend!  Wow is all I can say!     I am surprised you read all this. You just heard all of my meaningless patter. woohoo! Fun stuff...  I better get off to bed! Later gators.

            That's a really pretty song. I would love to have a voice like hers. [it's evanescence btw]  Hmmm..Today we had the bible study thing. My CYT friend Erin came so I just hung out with her and we talked about Tim for like 2 hours...it was odd. I was being really open! Cheers for me. I told her like my life story. Like about he-who-shall-not-be-named and every guy who has ever won my heart. [well..like all 2 of them]   It was nice. I barley even know her but I could tell her everything. I am make steps in the right direction!!  See, I trust no one. I think it's because I have been hurt in the past from telling my secrets. but now, nothing is a secret, I am an OPEN book.  Read me.    TABLE OF CONTENTS  Chapter 1- The importance of me being born in a subaro Chapter 2- I run for president of the United States at age 6 Chapter 3- I begin turmiol by registering at CAM Chapter 4- I start highschool Chapter 5- My heart belongs to Tim Chapter 6- I become a rock star Chapter 7- My album becomes platinum Chapter 8- I marry Tim [i can't forget that chapter!] Chapter 9- I become the first female president of the United [Whoaaa.blonde moment. It took my like 30 seconds to spell that word...sad... :) ] States Epolouge- I die!!   Wow.  What a great book!  Ok, I was totally kidding.  My life will probably end at chapter 5.  Well, my future will end, I will just become a homemaker longing for what I could have been.  Oh well. I least I will be raising godly children!  So, tomorrow I have to go to CAM to get my yearbook. I think I am going to die. That place gives me nightmares!! But, you all HAVE to come at 11 so we can hang! yippeee.  Dude, After having like 3 inspiring posts in a row I kinda have to write something that acctually is meaningful.  hm.  I will think of something.  *thinks hard*   Hebrews 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.  This is a powerful verse.   Just imagine your at the olympics. You qualified for the race and you have trained for years. You put for feet on the starting blocks. "Bang!" the whistle goes off. You try to run like you have practiced a thousand times but you feel suddenly jolted back. You loook and you are tied to the blocks!! Can you win the race?? I don't think so.  As Christians we need to untie all the knots from our past life that we are still tied in. We can't run when we are tied down! For me, these knots were trying to have clothes in style and having lots of money. Everyone strugles with different things so I can't really generalize.  But we are tangled in sin! How can we run the race God inteded for us when we are held down by the sin of the World?   1 Corinthians 9:24-25 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.  Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.    Don't you think its well worth it guys?! I mean I am not gonna deny that it brings satisfaction to have a pair of 100 dollars jeans but that satisfaction doens't last long! If we give up the joys of the world and chase after God's eternal joys we will have WAY more sasfaction than clothes or riches will ever bring you. And God's joy lasts FOREVER!  Have an awesome week you all!! I am heading to cannon beach for a couple days so I might not be able to update. I might walk to the library or something. We will have to see how it goes!!  I love you guys SO much.  Your buddy,  Laura

           Recently I have been trying to write all these inspiring posts and my inspiration is drained.  But, I will leave you with a well known, yet quite wonderful, verse.  Proverbs 31:30  Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;  but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.    I love that verse. We can all try to be beautiful and everything but eventually that beauty will go away. What's gonna be left? Our character! I would work more on tyring to be a good person rather than trying to be tthe next Giselle. [a supermodel...]   Today I went to nordstrom. Like I said yesterday, shopping isn't fun anymore!! I managed to find one nice shirt that matched with my plaid pants so I am quite happy. Then I went to the shoe department but becuase my feet are so gargantuous they didn't have the shoes I wanted in my size! So they are shipping them in and I should have them on Monday. Haha.  Then we went to costco to get some stuff for this big barbeque my mom is having for her bible study. It's kinda funny how my mom chose the week everyone was going to be gone except for I to have her party. Haha. I am going to have to baby sit a zillion kids but oh well. It will be fun!! Little kids can be nice.. :)  I love to talk to them because they are so clueless about modern society. They don't care about politics, dating, or much except if they get there applesauce. I wish more people could be like that! But, alas, we all must face reality!!!  I wuv you alllll!  Laura Fantora  [P.S. Is anyone else having problems with the spell check? Mine doesn't seem to be working...]

           Not really.  I am just writing because it is my duty. to have all these thoughts at just keep them inside would be quite meaningless. instead, I choose to share them with you.  Except, I have a problem. i can't think of a thing to say!!  This is quite depressing.   But, I will turn to the word of God.  And guess what. It aint good news.   James 2:2-4  Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?   This is a totally relevant problem in our churches and just about everywhere today.  It seems like we pay special attention to the people who are good looking and/or rich.  A school they are always the most popular.  They always seems to have the most friends.  if some we didn't know came to youth group and she wasn't attractive at all it seems like she would just get ignored.  But, if a beautiful person came they would probably be flocked to by a couple people as soon as she entered the room.  James 2:5- Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?  If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.  We need to reach out to EVERYONE. It doesn't matter if it would "hurt our reputation" to be seen with them. It really doesn't.  God died for EVERYONE. Everyone gets to heaven equally.   We need to love everyone.  We need to start a change in society. Reach out to the "unatractive" people. They need it way more than the rich and beautiful. They are also SO amazingly beautiful in there hearts, if only we would get to know them.

           I think worldview totally changed me. Haha. There big quote they kept repeating was "Reading makes you smarter." They would say it all the time! So today I thought I would just blog and use the computer but instead I found myself reading for hours and hours. And, if that wasn't enough, I cleaned the house because I knew my mom would be to tired to do it when she gets home.  I am starting to wierd myself out, but it rocks.  I can't watch TV anymore either. They told us to question everything we watched. They also told us how twisted the news was so I hate to watch that also.  I am a wreck!!! :)  Instead of reading the MSN Celebirty Gossip I am reading Shakespeare!    I am quite excited. I wish I could go to Worldview everyday. I love it so much.  It was like they open the fire hose of knowledge and I tried to drink it up as fast as I possibly could. It was hard at times to try to even get a little drink out of the rushing flood, but even to recieve little tablespoon was well worth the try.  As it turns out I wont get to go to the mall afterall. But I am not sad.   After Worldview I don't even like to shop!!  Right after camp ended my mom took me on a shopping trip in downtown Seattle. Just 7 days before I would have emptied my pockets at the sight of any item realtivley cool.  I tried on endless gorgeous clothes. But for some reason, I just felt like I needed nothing.  I may not have many clothes but I have more than enough. [does that even make sense?]  I used to be totally focused on my appearance. I used to even try to justify my "need" to look good with Bible verses.  But it was all a lie.  recently I was reading my Bible and I cam eupon this verse:  Psalm 45:11  The king is enthralled by your beauty;  honor him, for he is your Lord.   Isn't that wonderful?!  I may not be the most attractive girl. I may not have guys bowing at my feet. But, the KING OF THE WORLD is ENTHRALLED by MY beauty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I also found another verse..  1 Timothy 2:9-10 I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.    That is so right. It seems like I always get caught up with having expensive clothes that I ignore God. If I say I am a Christian, does that mean I have to look plain? Absolutely not. I am still struglling with this but it seems like God would want me to have confidence..and if I was wearing a patato sack it doesn't seem like I would have any confidence...   Hmm.  Something to ponder, eh?

           Noodle!  Hmm.  Today I am going to the mall to get new shoes. Which is kinda dumb..because it's the mall. How much worse can you get?  But I am finally decided on my style for school this year...  I am going to a be a guitar rocker chick! Hahahahhahaha!!  Becasue playing the guitar is totally in style. [well...maybe not as much for acoustic..electric guitars rock!]  I feel wierd going to the mall though. I mean everyone goes to the mall. Everyone looks the same. I don't want to look like all the mall goers! I want to look like LAURA!! It's so hard though.  It seems like the only way I can be the only one who has my clothes is to either make me own clothes [which I have totally tried but it didn't work] or buy designer [which is totally not an option]  I think I am going to take a class on how to make my own clothes. That would rock!

      Well, I guess that would be proper. A lot of boys are nice.  Hmm..  I hate girls?  No...girls can be nice to.  I hate teenage dating?  Exactly.   So, I went to youth group churchy thing tonight.  It wasn't to fun. See, my best church friend got this random boy friend while I was away. Now she is very much different and I am left to fend for myself once again.  Church doesn't seem much fun anymore, and it's not only that.  I loooooveee big church, but the highschool church is just blah. All the lessons are simple. I don't know if they think we are just young babies who can't swallow big people food or if it is just the truth of this generation.  it seems like there isn't the same love for learning that was found less than a hundred years ago. Now we are all easily amused by the flicker of the televsion set rather than the calming turn of pages from a book.   Now it's time for a break in our regularly scheduled rant for a note of happiness!  Have any of you seen my pretty purse? It's purple and it looks like a casette player? Well, I brought it to big church today [with much pricless contents] and I left it on my seat!!!! I didn't realize till we went home. But, my wonderful sister found it!!!!!! I was IMMENSLY joyous! Props to Hans!

            Good morning ya'll!  am really sick and tired, but oh well. My body is exhausted. I haven't gotten very much sleep for the last two weeks. But now I will get to rest for a couple days. Today I have to go to church but I might just sleep instead because, lke I said earlier, I am quite sick.  Today I woke up at 12. Then I unpakced my suitcases. I hate unpacking! It takes so long. I love to pack because I am always excited to be going somewhere but when I get home i am always really tired and in a bad mood. :)  Blehh. I feel like...I dunno..just sick.  Tomorrow my dad and my brothers are going to go on a 50 mile hike around Mt. Rainier. It should take a week. Then, on Monday morning, my sister is going to camp! So it will just be me and my mom alllll week! We are going to go to Cannon Beach for a couple days and probably [hopefully] go to the Couv Mall and get new shoes. How exciting!!  Then MANDY COMES!  I am so excited!!!!!!!  Mwa hahahahhaahahhahahaa!  We are gonna go crazy. woohoo!

I learned what a psuedo-christian cult is, why Atheist have to have way more faith than christians, how a New Age person believes they are God, what a leaver is, and MANY other things. I learned so much I just feel like...really smart. Hahaha. not that I will sound smart. But it's SO much easier to defend my fiath now that I know all the answers.  Hm.  Hahahah!!   I shouldn't make posts late at night.  I go cuhhh-razzzyy!

            I JUST REALIZED THIS IS MY 598TH POST! and do you know what that means?  Party in the house.  Now, because I am "in the mood" I shall make a super long post! Hah!  so on Sunday I woke up at 6 and hopped in the car. We went to Ikea and spent like two hours there which was boring because we weren't shopping for me. [so, I am a self centered freak, sue me. (wow. Stop talking Laura)]  Then I was like "can we go to Nordstorm?" and my mom was like "Okay" So I got these cool plaid pants. But I had a problem. I don't have anything that goes with them. Hahahha. I am so un-smart. So now I have a useless pair of pants in my closet. Acctually, I am planning on going to the couv mall later to get a matching shirt..but anyWHOO.   I really need  a new pair of shoes because my shoes aren't all pretty and white anymore so I tried on endless pairs of Pumas but since I have huge feet none of the ones i liked were in the proper color. At least the show fitting man was absolutely gorgeous. I felt kinda bad that I didn't buy something from him but oh well.  Then we went to queen anne and had lunch with my cool cousin Chrystal.  After that we went to CAMP.  We registered and they gave me my key and I went to my dorm...My roommate was sitting on her bed. At first I was like "Oh crap, she is like 18.." but as it turns out she was only 8 days older than me. Haha. She was quite friendly. Then we went to dinner which was tasty.  Then after some other random things we went to sleep. Amy [my roomie] and I just fell right asleep. We had to wake up at 7:00 for breakfast. It was good too. I had sausage, hash browns, water, french toast, and I think I had eggs.  Then we had our first day of classes.  They were scary.  Everyone was like little theologians. I was like I am going to die.  I am an okay christian and all but I didn't have a clue as to what the shroud of tehedron was.  so Monday I was like "I WANNNA GOOO HOMMMEE" well, not that excesive..but you get the picture.  Then I went to bed and I woke up. [are you sure about that?]  Everything was just SOOOOO much better, I started ot understand everything it was GRAND.  Then came Wednesday and we went to go practice what we learned. We went to the university of washington campus and we went and talked to all these people. It was awesome. But really sad. All the people I talked ot were so lost. I talked to this guy named Yoshi for like a half an hour and he was like "I bielve in rencarnation" it was sad. Then this other guy I talk to was like "I wanna go to hell because that's where all the drugs are" It was kind of scary.  But it was awesome becuase I felt like I could acctually do somehting. God gave me SO much strength.  [Not to mention I walked around with this awesome guy named jodie]  Well. yeah.  I learned a TON. We had like 40 hours of classes. It was crazy.  But yeah.  Fun stuff man.

            Wow. I feel really stupid. My small group leader got married today and I slept in and missed it. [it was in the morning] GRRRR.  Well, today I am going to church and taking a shower to get rid of my 80s hair. I think that's it. I am probably just going to relax because I leave tomorrow morning for camp. Lalala.  I am so excited for camp yet I am scared at the same time.  it seems like I am clsoe to God right now and hopefully this camp will just increase the closeness. It's like a...I don't know. it's hard to explain but bassicly at camp you just listen to speakers speak. Woohoo! It will be nice to sit instead of having to dance all day!  I am kind of scared about the people who will be attending the camp though. I am the only one who is going that I know. [haha] I don't even know my roomate. it will be okay though. La de do.

            [if you didn't read my last post, go read it!]  Well, I didn't mean to type that I was a jerk, which I am. But I was just going ot talk about Anna and how she likes Tim. Even though she didn't tell me it was totally obvious. She ate with him everyday and she was the only girl at the table. She never really talked to me. It was just like she was cuaght in her own little world. Anna and I are usually pretty good friends. I HATE HIGHSCHOOL.  But while I was typing all that I realized how horrible everything was. I am just being stupid.  I talk about everyone behind there bakcs and I am GOING TO STOP.  But I need your help, whenever I do it alert me. And, you all don't talk about other people to me behing there backs becasue I will be SO tempted to listen and that is just as bad as if I was telling hte gossip myself.  That is all.  Waaa. I am way to emotional.

            Now that I have been home for a bit I am ready to tell you about my camp experience.  Well, first, it was exhausting.  It srarted Monday early morning and we got there and put our stuff in our rooms. Then we went straight to our first rehersal where we learned the song "Footloose" and these crazy dance moves. Then they did and audition thing where we had groups of 5 and we had to perform on the stage. Then we did they groups of 5 thing againa nd sang a song. Then we had lunch, which was pretty good. I am thinking I had pizza.  Then they cast the roles. laura didn't get a part but she was happy because the people who had parts had to work way harder than the rest of us.  Then...hours later. The scene: A funny old dorm room. Two girls, Karsen and Laura, try to sleep with no luck. They sleepily talk about life.  Karsen says in an exhausted voice "What if you scared your grandpa and he died, would yoou get in trouble?"  Laura responds cluelessly "What are you talking about Karsen?" then go into spasms of laughter.  [More conversation continues]  [door knocks]  A leader like figure enters "Girls, lights out was 2 hours ago, get to sleep!"  Girls respon in unison "Okay."  Hahahha. That was weird.  Laura's stupid qutoe for the day [monday] "Is this the improv room?"    [Story time]  So it was like our little free time kinda thing [which I was mistaken,read on]Bekah siad somethign about having a fun time just to play improv games and I love improv so I was like "Woohoo!"  so I went and changed into my pink barbie like outfit and went to where Improv was supposed to be. I was really hyper so I push the door open and I was like "IS THIS WHERE IMPROV IS?" and they was a huge group of CYT people having a Bible Study. Hahahah. [it was funnier in real life] I felt really  blonde because everyone was having "God moments" and here comes Laura, the freak, "IS THIS IMPROV?" everyone laughed. Hahaha.   Hmm  Then we woke up and it was Thursday. We rehersed like ALL Day. Then we ate some.  And then we had a bible study.  Most of the days were the same.  But I figured out a lot fo stuff about myself.  Like how I don't fit in anywhere.  I figured out that the reason I never fit in is so I can be friendly to the new people or the people who don't have friends.  I figured out a ton of other stuff which I tried to share at the "share time" this morning but it didn't make sense and I bet everyone thought I was a jerk. Haha. I said something like "I used to think that only a few people deserved my love" and everyone was like ":o" and I was like "alrighty...sitting down now." That always happens when I try to say somethign amazing, it comes out all wrong!!   Hmm..  i am going ot go to friday.  So we all got into our awesome 80s outfits. Me, Karsen, and Katie ehad had the BEST COSTUMES.  Christina and her loyal followers didn't do like anything I was like "this is theatre, go crazy!" and Janelle [the dance instuctor] was like "The Barbies didn't do anything to there hair" I was like "I LOVE YOU JANELLE" I didn't realize that about her until the last day, which was sad. I always thought she liekd the pretty people more because she was always putting them in the front of the stage. [I know..I think weird thoughts] I mean really, I was always placed in the back. Shoudl I take the hint?  but then, when Janelle said that I relaized that we kind of had the same mind. It made me smile.  We had a rehersal then it was time for our performance. it went super welll!! I only messes up like 3 times!!! Go LAURA!! Christina messed up more than me so I was like "Hah!!" It made me super happy. Gosh, I am being mean to her again. STOP LAURA.   But. What. I CAN'T TALK. I am trying to go into a subject that had been bothering me  all week but I can't put it into words. It was just this moment that made me like start totally crying in front of everyone. Not like they could see it or anything. Over the years I have learned to hide my emotions.  So, Tim Head [sheriff] was singing his "Heaven" solo and I was just like staring at him and I heard this voice in my head and it just kept going over and over saying "You're going to marry Tim Head" and I was like "Yeah right whoever you are. You obviously don't know that Tim is like the most gorgeous guy in the entire world. I mean davis times 10,000" and then it was like "What makes you think your not good enough for him. you deserve him."  it freaked me out.  I am just going to put it aside and just  make myself think I was just of in my own little world trying to make myself feel better by saying that.  It was just weird.  I mean it's not liek I wouldn't absolutely love to marry Tim...it's just like I am not worthy of him.  And I am totally not putting myself down.   I cried a lot this week, but no one saw. Like I said, I hide my emotions. Like when everyone was sharing and stuff the tears just started pouring.  A lot of people think I am very unemtional but I am like the most emotional girl EVER.   But guess what. I observed a lot this week and I have offically decided I am a JERK.  I'm out.

            Tomorrow, camp begins!!  It's  kinda sad to have to be away from my blog for so long. well, I guess it's  only 5 days..but still..that's a long time!  Then I get back and I only have one day then I go to my other camp! Crazyy.  Today I got way to much  sleep  so hopefully I will be able  to  fall asleep tonight.  Karsens coming over today!! Woohoo! She is going to  spend  the night then  we  are going to camp together.  I  wonder  what  dorm place we are staying  in.   There are two dorm  halls  on the Warner campus. One is like Smith hall or something. Then the other one is Warman Hall,  named  after my grandpa! That would be funny if we stayed there.  Well...I can't think of much else to say.. uhh ...bye!

           At the beach awhile ago I was flipping channels and I landed on MTV. I know that's a horrible channel and I should watch any of it, but I couldn't help it. There was this enthralling video that popped up.   "Jesus show me the way cuz the devils tryin to break me down"  I raised an eye brow skeptically. How can a black rapper pose with a half naked women and proclaim he is a Christian?  I kept listening. I could here the awkward spaces where the cuss words were taken out.  How can this man be a Christian if he uses a cuss word in every paragraph  "I wanna talk to God but I'm so afraid cuz we haven't talked in so long"  Then I realized how he is just like me. We have both done horrible things in our life. We both need the same God.   I don't know a thing about Kanye West, but he rapped about Jesus. Though it has some bad moments, it has a good message.  I realize how much I judge. I think I am this perfect Christian who is better than everyone.  But I am not.  I am a Christian because I realize how much I fail and how much I need God.  I am a Christian because I realize how weak I am, I need God to stand.  I am a Christian because I am lonely, I need God to talk to.  I am not a Christian because I am already perfect and I just want to be with people like me.  I am a Christian because I don't belong in this world.    urlLink Here  are the lyrics. You can analyze them anyway you want. But really, it doesn't matter.    He is just like each and everyone of us.  He has a message and this is how he chose to say it.  I only wish he would represent more of a Christian person. But I guess I shouldn't be asking for that.   This song is a powerful tool to reach a world filled with people who are looking for something, and that something is Jesus.  We shold pray for Kanye, since he is our brother.

            Then why am I sitting here eating them?! Thanks to my moms ever increasing health food fetish I will never get to eat normal crackers like a normal kid. But, then again, I am in no sense normal. I don't really want to be a normal kid or anything. What's the fun in that?? I mean normal kids don't run across train tracks a minute before a trains crosses just for a thrill. A normal kid would never tear off those "Do not remove under penalty of law" tags on blow dryers. But, come on, why would I use a blow dryer while taking a bath?! It defies all senses of human competence.    Speaking of blow dryers....I had to go to wal-mart today to get one. This was my second time in 3 days going there!! Cuh-razyyy!! Wal-mart kinda scares me at times. Like today this street guy followed me... Then all the normal wal-mart shoppers glare at me where ever I go. I always smile at them but I guess they can't even look at a girl who wears real adidas shoes. AI wish I could just go into wal-mart and give each and every one of those people there a brand new pair of the nicest shoes money can buy, but, I cannot. So, instead I just smile.  I know, who would want a smile instead of a new pair of shoes, but it's the least I can do.  So I picked out the cheapest blow dryer that would actually blow dry my hair in a reasonable amount of time. It's like the Rembrandt 1385 or some group of fancy sounding numbers. It's not the best blow dryer but I am short on cash. Then I had to get this braces cleaning tool because I left my other one on the plane. I actually ended up buying three because they only come in packages of three. I also bought some shaving cream! Hahahha.  Speaking of shaving...So, a couple days ago I went into the shower in a total daze. I started shaving and I was like wait a second..Something is wrong. And instead of shaving cream I was using shampoo! Haha! It was odd.  After picking out all my necessary items I went into this line. It looked like the shortest but it turned out to be really long. I was right behind this guy who was getting mad at everything. The poor lady ran out of coins so she had to get more and this man was like "Could you move ANY slower???" I was like "Whoa, Nellie! Do you want change? Then your going to have to wait!" then she was having problems loading the change so she had to get this other lady to help her. The man just stood there with his arms crossed anxiously tapping his foot.  Then it finally was his turn! He breathed a sigh of relief and placed his sleeping bag and sun block on the counter. Then, this poor lady, she couldn't get the sleeping bag to scan correctly. He said "It's $9.83, okay??" right after he said that it scanned. The price showed up as "$9.97" "Well, I deserve those 14 cents." "Are you a Washington resident?" the cashier said. We get that a lot. We are close to the border. Oregon residents don't have to pay sales tax, us Washingtonians do.   "I'm a Washington resident and proud!!!" The man said quite loudly.  It seems like a lot of Americans have this problem. We are proud to be from here but we don't put our pride good use. Maybe if this man was truly proud to live in this beautiful state he should try to make it a better place. It's not like he had to save the forest or anything. All he had to do to make a big change is just  be patient with the cashier.  If we are proud to be American we should get involved. I know you hear this a lot from everyone... But there isn't much to it! Maybe if you see trash on the side of the sidewalk throw it away. Smile at everyone. Give a quarter to a homeless person. Do whatever.  But really, all we have to do is just love others.

           To thee, my blogger!  Today  I  went to church which was okay, I guess. See, our pastor is in Indonesia on a mission trip so we have all the other pastor people preaching and they aren't as good as Pastor Matt. Today we had the junior high pastor speak. He  spoke  about tempations and suchw which on a normal day I would have liked  a lot  but I am in just  a bad mood today.  On  these  days  I need the most of God but its hardest to listen.  Today Jacob took Matt and I to Baja Fresh and I got the SUPER TASTY chicken tacos and they come wraped in foil. For some reason I remembered a couple  years ago  how I promised that if  I  ever got braces I would have to chew foil to see what it felt  like ! Hahahhahaha! But I was way to scared so I just sucked on the  foil.  Hahahha!! It felt so weird!!   it kinda hurt...

           My neck hurts so bad!! Oh well,  I  have had worse. One time..well..let  me give some back ground. For some reason at my old house I could never  sleep   on  my bed. After just laying there for a couple of hours trying to fall asleep I would just end up  rolling  off my bed onto the floor [the rolling part was kinda fun!!] and then I would fall right asleep. See, our house was awesome. We had heated   floors !!! So  when  you would lay on the carpet it would be toasty and warm!! It rocked. In this house whenever  I  walk on the floors early in the morning I am like "Brrrr!!!" because I can totally  tell  a huge difference.  So, most nights I would sleep on our carpet. One night for some odd reason I slept totally weird. I woke up and I could not move. Like, at all. The only body part I could move was like my fingers. It was a sunday so we had to go to church and  my friends  and  I  would always run around and be crazy but I couldn't becuase it hurt so bad.   That  really stunk.    Today  I took a  super long shower. It was nice. But, the water was never the right temperature!!! I totally need to invent a  shower  that right when you turn it on it knows who you are and exactly what temperature you like so it heats up to that temperature. Wouldn't that rock?  I  think so.  Then I blow dryed my hair. My hair is growing so much!!! i  bet my the end of this school year it's going to be the same length it was before I  cut  it! Woohhoo!! Shot hair is nice and all, but I love long hair.  Did I tell you what i'm going to do next summer? At the very beginning I am going to get it don't in a TON of little braids! Woohoo! Then I will  never have to style it or anything!  I am quite excited.  but that's a long ways away.  Oh well.   I hope this  school  year is fun. I am starting to get scared, very scared. What if  everyone hates  me???  I don't see why they would or anything...but there are always those what if's.  I hope I find a lot of friends. Because Katie and Heather will be like the best of friends...so then there is me. I will eat   lunch  with them and everything but they have like so much sutff that's well..inside  I  guess. Like the two of them know everything about eachother. I bet Katie G. and I will  grow  really close becuase we are both good friends with Katie and Heather but we don't know all the  inside  information.  I wonder if we will have any classes together. because Katie G., Heather, and Katie are all in Algebra 2 and I am in Geomtry. Yuck. I think Katie and I might have history together though so that should be fun. History rocks.  I wanna be  a  history  teacher!  That would be fun.   I  want to teach Junior High because I want to be able to help those kids while they are in weird times.  it's  funny  how I am refering to Junior Highers as kids considering I was one yet a year and a half ago.  It seems like such a long time ago!!!   I  didn't really   like  junior high. It was my first year of real school so it was kind of scary. I got messsed up friends. At first they all said they were Christians but they totally didn't act like  Christians.  It was sad. I wonder where they are now. We kinda parted ways and lost touch, I hope they are ok.   [Did you see the secret message? Hahahhahahahha!!]

            So, last night I bought "Screaming Infedelties" off of Itunes and my Dad got all mad because he said it was a bad song. But there isn't anything bad in it..it just has a bad title. Oh well.  I am so tired and sore. I didn't get much sleep last night and when I woke up I couldn't move my neck to the right. Haha. It hurts really bad.  Tonight I might not have to go to youth group which is nice because everyone is at camp so no one would be there. I bet my mom will make me go anyways. It's good for me... *rolls eyes*  Hmm. I can't think of much more to say so I will be leaving now!!  Laura

            I don't feel like posting. I think I have been over   urlLink blogging.   See, I had this super long inspiring post but, alas, I deleted it my accident. Sad. So instead, I shall leave you with a poem I wrote.

            I know..I know. I would never ask a question like that because my mom would probably go crazy and be like "ARE YOU ANOREXIC?" she always asks me that. One time a couple years ago olive and I got into a fight [hahhaa. cat fight!!!!] and he scratched me and made me bleed a bit on my arm but it wasn't that big of a deal so I didn't report the occurence to the auhorities. [aka, my mum]  Later that day my mom took a look at my arm and was like "ARE YOU CUTTING YOURSELF?!" uh...No. Calm down.  But the reason that was the title of my post was becuase I tried on  my 80s outfit and it makes me look...uh...like a teenage mother?  See for yourself... do you think I look as...weird..as I think I look?    Oh well...all for theatres sake!!  So today I cleaned and it took so long, I thought I was going to die. But I didn't. I have to clean out all the windows and I opened our bathroom window and I was about to clean it but, to my disgust, I saw 5 dead hosue flys in it!!!!! It was SO sick. I am like really scared of bugs! Haha. so I paid my mom 2 dollars to throw them away. Hahaha.  Then I got hungry and when I am hungry I COOOK! So I made 2 yummy key lime pies. I ate two pieces already! tasty.  But now I am starting to feel sick. Whenever I eat citrus it upsets my stomach. One time I ate 3 glasses of pink lemonade and about an hour later I threw up pink all over our white carpet. Haha [TMI!! TMI!!]  My mom says I have almost thrown up in as many places as her. Her most famous..uh..release of stomach contents was on a taxi cab in rome. Mine was at a civil war museum on all the pricless antiques.  Wow, I am going to stop now. Hahhaha.  Anywho.  Well, I guess those coments kinda ended my whole posting mood...adios!!  Laura

            So, I began this post hoping to write something noteworthy that you all could take to heart, but alas, my brain died. I'm serious, it just fizzled away into a meaningless blob!!!!! Sad times.  But, I just wanted to tell you all to be happy, no matter what. Well, you don't need to be happy but I want you all to feel joy in your hearts no matter what situation.  Since I am not the most eloquent person around I will leave you with a grand Psalm.  Psalm 5   1 Give ear to my words, O LORD ,  consider my sighing.  2 Listen to my cry for help,  my King and my God,  for to you I pray.  3 In the morning, O LORD , you hear my voice;  in the morning I lay my requests before you  and wait in expectation.   4 You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil;  with you the wicked cannot dwell.  5 The arrogant cannot stand in your presence;  you hate all who do wrong.  6 You destroy those who tell lies;  bloodthirsty and deceitful men  the LORD abhors.   7 But I, by your great mercy,  will come into your house;  in reverence will I bow down  toward your holy temple.  8 Lead me, O LORD , in your righteousness  because of my enemies-  make straight your way before me.   9 Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;  their heart is filled with destruction.  Their throat is an open grave;  with their tongue they speak deceit.  10 Declare them guilty, O God!  Let their intrigues be their downfall.  Banish them for their many sins,  for they have rebelled against you.   11 But let all who take refuge in you be glad;  let them ever sing for joy.  Spread your protection over them,  that those who love your name may rejoice in you.  12 For surely, O LORD , you bless the righteous;  you surround them with your favor as with a shield.

            Boys and girls!  wow, I have no clue what i'm saying. Any who...I am in the middle of cleaning my house. Fun stuff... See, my brother didn't want to clean this week so I have to do the whole house. Double the cash, but double the work. It's a win loose situation. Usually I have to do 2 hours of work but now I am going to be cleaning all afternoon! Oh well. Now I  will have enough money for my worldview camp in 2 weeks.  Yay! I wonder if I have to buy anything at CYT camp..I doubt it but I will bring a little bit of money just in case.   I am quite excited. I hope good people come. Some people at CYT don't like me very much so we will see how it goes.   I wont get to blog for 5 days, but it will be quite worth it! We have a performance at the end of the week which should be quite interesting. it's "Footloose" woohoo! It's a play about this guy who moves to this town where you can't dance. Hahahha. Typical musical plot.  Musicals are so weird. I wish life was like a musical where people would just start dancing and singing in unison, it would make life so much easier.

           Hi! I thought I was going to do absolutely nothing today, but I was quite wrong! [Being wrong never felt so good... :) ] So, my mom came home from the beach today and we are totally out of food so she decided to go to the store. I was like "woohoo! Something to do finally" As it turns out we were just going to freddys! Mwa haha! We went to Wal-Mart and I got a AWESOME cowboy hat. It makes me look like a total hick!!!!!!!!! Then I went to the boys section [why should only boys get the cool clothes???] and I got three blue t-shirts.  Then we hopped in the car and went to target!!! There I got awesome hello kitty hair clips! They were in the little girls section! Woohoo! Then we went to Winco and we got a toooonnnnn of grocerys! I was in the cooking mood so I was like "Mom can I get some stuff for a key lime pie?" and she was like "Of course!" well..now that I think about it she probably said something like "O.K." but still.... So I got alll the stuffff.  Then by the time we got home it was about 9:30. The reason I got my three, blue, boys t-shirts was for camp! See, I am on the blue team and I was looking in my closet and I realized I  didn't have very many blue shirts. So I got those three shirts and ironed of fun stuff with these cool iron on letters. My three shirts say: "Woo blue," "I love blue and blue loves me," and "blew" Hahhahahaha. I had to do the last one that way because I ran out of Us and I wanted to say something about blue. My sister told me to spell it was way and it looked cool!  But, on the "I love.." one I messed up. Haha. I took of the little iron on paper stuff for a couple letters but then I re-ironed another part and by accident I iron the letters so they smuged. My mom was like "AHHHHH!!! YOU PROBABLY BROKE THE IRON!" and I was like "I have   everything   under control! Haha [that didn't make much sense but it sounded good in my head...]  I totally need to take a picture of my rockin shirts! But, I have gotten complaints about the long load time of my site so I doubt I will.  At about 10:15 my brother, Jacob, was like "I am going to the astronomy shop!" and I was like "Ooooh! I wannnna goo!" and Jacob said "Ok!" So we both hopped into the truck and headed towards the astronomy shop. But this isn't any ordinary astromy shop. Every night it's like a star party and science geeks just hang around outside looking at starts for hours.   It was awesome! I was the only girl so that was kinda weird. Haha. They were all like making jokes about smart stuff and everything. Haha. I wish I didn't have such a bad memory or I would post some of there conversations.. I saw SO many stars! I saw like 3 "globular clusters" they had funyn names! The ones I saw were like M-52, M-12, and M-47. They were named by like this guy in the 1700s who discovered them. He discovered 110 object in space that are like the 110 most easily seen things when your looking into the sky.   I also saw another galaxy! It was tilted on its side so it was like a straight line but it was still cool. Then I saw this star that glowed red! It was cooooooool! Then I saw this nebula. Pur-tay!   It was a lot of fun! I can't wait until I discover my plant! Fantora, here I come!!   Today my brother, Matt, and I were talking about hockinson and You can get our own personalized parking spot and I was like "You should get one Matt!" and he was like "Okay! But were NOT naming it Fantora." I laughed.  I guess that's it.  I wuv you guys!  Laura Fantora

See, shoutboxes are temporary but comments last forever.... :)  Dude, I have a piece of popped cord stuck in my braces and it wont come out!! I don't understand! why do I have you go through this torcher? :) Acctually, braces are totally not as bad as I thought they would be. I thought my teeth would always hurt but they don't! Plus, I don't look like  a beaver anymore!!  I have  a  really boring life. Well not most of the time, but today it i quite boring. I have no clue what I am going to fill my time with today! Hmm....  You know what. Whenever I say goodbye on a blog post it just feels akward. Like should I just leave without telling you i am going to leave? Do I have to "sign" my name? Gosh, so many decisions!  Ummmm...

           I followed the crowd and took a quiz..Bad laura...BAD LAURA!!!    You are going to marry Ashton Kutcher. He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (14 choices now!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    He is hot. [asthma catcher! Hahahha]  Like on that 70s show.  Wow. Every post I make is making me sound worse and worse and worse and worse...   Back to the real Laura. I have absolutely nothing to do until Sunday. Which makes me happy...but kind of sad. I want to do something awesomely cool. Like discover a new planet or something. I hope my brother wants to look at stars tonight.  He is going to buy a new telescope!! It cost 500 dollars so that will help me in my search for extra terrestials and/or my new planet! I am totally gonna name it Fantora.  Woohoo!  But the thing is, I am deathly afraid of stars so I can only look at them for about 15 minutes then I run inside all scared. Hahahha.  As I am approaching 80,000 words I want to say thank you. I know i say this a lot, but I totally mean it! I couldn't ask for a better grope of people to be reading my innermost thoughts.   Well, actually, they aren't my most innermost thoughts but they are close.  I wish I could tell you my inner thoughts but I would probably loose a lot of friends...my thoughts are just...weird...Hahaha.  Now that I have scared enough of you with that snippet on my thoughts I will be leaving...

            Since I am an up and coming deisgner and all I decided to cut up T-shirts. If you have never done it, go do it now! It's one of the simple joys in life. And if you mess up, lets just hope it wasn't your favorite t.  So, first I cut up my Footloose shirt so now I look like 80s trash! Woohooo! but I cut it a little to short so when I move my arms you can see SKIN. AH! Not CYT apropriate. Because you know my stomach fat is quite seductive. Well, it doesn't show that much..but..yeah.  So then I moved on to my "Bonjour Paris" shirt I got from the great UO. It may have been 22 dollars at the time of purchase, but that was a while ago. It needed a makeover!! Haha. So I cut off the sleeves like totally and made them do up the neck at an angle. It looks hot. And it is quite modest tooo!    That picture doesn't really show off the real beauty of that shirt, but it's super cool! Here is a photo...   Oh my goodness. In all my excitment to get home I forget to tell you the most exciting thing that happened at the BEACH. I found my dads box of old records!!!!!! he had RUBBER SOUL!!! And that cool Pink Floyd album. My dad has the BEST records. I am going to buy a record player for my room and just play them. He had like 200 records of every band you could imagine. I also found some of my moms records. They were all like Barbara Streisand and I was like "MOM YOU LISTENED TO THIS??? Hahhahahahhahahahahhaha"  It was great.  Here are some photos..  here are the some of the best records..you can't really see what ones they are, but trust me, they rock!   My dad showing off his pink floyd "dark side of the moon" 8 track. Hahahhaha   Beatles record on a record player, pure joy.    Ooh, and sorry for you people who don't like me to post so many pictures, I can't stop me!  :)  Oh, i'm thinking of deleting my shout box and just having the comments, but if I do you guys better post comments!!!!!! Does this sound ok?

            So today I had to make dinner because everyone except my dad and I are at the beach still. I offically decided I am a rice failure. I can't cook rice!! Everytime I try i messes up!! Today, by accident, I put a cup extra water in the rice so it was like rice soup. It was so disgusting. Who in there right mind would eat this crap?? It seems odd that everyone in all poor contries can cook rice but I can't. Totally unfair.   Hmm..  My blog has been lacking creativity lately. Doesn't that sadden you? It saddens me.  Sincce I am trying to "build and educated vocaulary" I will post some smart, yet awesome, words.  Emulate- To strive to equal or excel, usually through intimiadtion. [Is it just me or does that word sound a whole lot like mutalte? Scary.]  Stymie- To thwart [TRY ME! No STYMIE! Wow. That didn't even make sense...ignore me.]  Apocryphal- Fictitious, spurious [does anyone even get the definition????]  Okay, so those are the three words of the day, use 'em and use 'em often!  I'm out like a man after his first frat party. [i'm a good little christian girl, I swear! I know nothing about frat parties!] Laura

            It's JULY which obviously means it's time to buy back to scool clothes. *rolls eyes*  I got the Delias back to school catalog today and I must say, this fall is going to be one of the best clothes buying season. I mean last spring was horrible!! Who would wear Uggs with a mini skirt? I mean really. The fashion industry was doomed with that mistake. geez. I should be the one who makes the decisions of what goes on the racks. Iknow what people will acctually wear. Hot sweaty boots made friend lamg hair? I think not. Save the Lambs!!   Today I went to Katies house. So fun!!! We went for a walk and as a joke we [Abby, Heather, Johanna, and I] lost katie and nick. We thought they were  still following us but when we got back to Katies hosue they weren't there and it took them like 20 minutes to come back. fun times.  I better goooo, talk to you all later!

            Wahhoo!!! I might post more later but yeahh. Lalal.  But the sad thing is most of the photos are of my team mates.I had battery problems on the days where we hung out with the improv people so I couldn't take photos of all them :( Sad times.  Here is Bekah in the car on the way to disney land! She looks quite happy for being one who woke up at 3 AM. :)   Our first steps in the "Happiest Place on Earth"   Getting scared before Indiana Jones! (that ride ROCKED!!!)   I conquered my first roller coaster! I rock!!! :)  The characters on their float!   The  notorious teapots!   Trying to get the sword out of the stone. [I think stephen gave up!!]   Before the "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" movie   Heather and I infront of cinderellas castle!!   Me getting ready for BINGO night [and my first meeting of andrew even though I was unaware of it at the time]    What we saw while on stage at the Improvathon [though all the seats were filled!]   Our team!!!!     Andrew... *sigh* This is the only picture I have of him and it's not very good but you get the idea :)   Central. Ah! They were quite intimidating. But the guy on the left was..well..beautiful. He wasn't hot but everything abot him was perfect. It was weird.      That's alllll!!!! I wuv you guuys!

            I am at the library. And guess what. It's pouring rain out. Haha. I still have to make the 20 minute walk home and I am in shorts and a t-shirt. If you haven't noticed I am in quite the horrible mood. :) My mom woke me up early and I am still quite exhausted from having 4 hours of sleep every night in California.  La la la la.  I can't think of much to say exceppttt  I AM GOING HOME TONIGHT!! Yes.  Cannon beach is nice and all but I am obsessed with home. Home home home. I love my home.  Someone was on the interenet [there is only one computer here] and I had to wander around town for about an hour and it was really rainy so I was quite cold so I went into the gelato shop and bought some tea and a cookie. The cookie was really good but the tea was like 50 million degrees so I burnt my tounge! It's sitting outside right now because you aren't supposed to bring drinks into the library.   Last night I was "trying to burn fat" [hahaha] by watching FitTV. It was SO funny. I did this carribean workout and it was soooooo tyring. I thought I was going to die. Hahaha. I am such a wimp when it comes to fitness. But the leader guy kept saying "Excellent, excellent, excellent" I would die of laughter whenever he said that so I would loose my beat and just end up waiting until the next commercail break to continue my "workout"   Fun times!  Woot wooot!  Dudeeee..I can't read my shoutbox so you all should post in the little comment thing.  I willl post late tonight when I am finally HOME!!!  woooohoo!!  Your buddy until the day I die...

           If you haven't read my previous post read it righttttt NOW before comtinuing :)   So, at Fuddruckers Stephen and I wandered around to all the tables and we looked at all the cool beatles stuff on the wall. Then my new friends Stephanie had to go so I said good bye but we forgot to give eachother our e-mail addresses so I will probably never talk to her again which is SUPER SAD. [wow..runnn on sentences at there best!]  Then I ate my chicken burger and my cousin had to go home so I said good bye to her..thenn..  We went ot this play on top of this huge mountain. It was an outdoor ampitheater so you could see like all of san diego from the top of it. You could also see parts of Mexico and the Pacific ocean. It rocked. The play was all right. Not my favorite but it wasn't like i hated it or anything. Then I said my final good byes to the improv people which was reaaally reaaallly sad I almost wanted to cry because I would never see them ever again. Hugging continued. Blah blah blah.  Then we went back to our hotel and Larry, Stephen, Heather, Beka, Jackie and I played pocker with pennies. I really really wanted to ask the other improv people if they wanted to play because they were all on our floor but no one else wanted to. I was sad. Then in the middle of our game for some reason Beka was like "LETS GO RUN!!!" so we ran around all the hallways in our 14 story hotel. it was the greatest thing ever!!! Considering it was 3 in the AM I felt like a total outlaw. It rocked. There was a huge wedding going on and by accident we like ran into the reception. Haha. It was funnnnn-kneee. Then we were all super tired and Larry fell asleep on my bed.Then for like an hour we talked about how bad the improvathon was. I didn't really think it was bad at all. Everyone was saying how it was God's pourpose to bring us here but then he kind of failed us. I don't think it was his pourpose to bring us here to win first place. I think God wanted us to grow closer together. I tried to tell that to everyone but they just kind of glared at me so I was like "Okayy...never mind"  Then we all went to bed and boarded our plane.  Right when I arived at the air port it was off to the beach house. Which is where I am now because my grandpa just alerted me that we do have internet. It is SO slow though. Oh well.  Yesterday we had a little birthdya celebration for my grandpa. He turned 75!! And we planned our trip to NEW YORK!!!!! We are going to see a differen't show every night!! Wooooohooo!!  Then we drove to seaside for the fire works. Those were CRAZY. Everyone is so outof control. You know those huge ones that are at the fire work shows? Someone lit it right next to us and it was supposed to go up in the air but it blew up on the ground and i almost got killed. It was SO scary. I was like screaming and running for my life. Hahahha.  Some day you guys all have to go spend 4th of july with us in Seaside. It is quite a memorable experience!  Then when we got home i went right to bed. I didn't wake up till 12 because i was SO stinking tired.  And now I am here at our beach house being bored.  I am going to try to hitch a ride with my dad tomorrow so I can get home ASAP. I miss Olive!!  Talk to you all later!!  I wuv you guys!!!  Laura Fantora

           This might be a long post, BRACE YOURSELF!  I shall start with Thursday.  Thursday.  [alrighty then...] I woke up at 3 and I just wandered around aimlessly for like a half an hour because I woke up way to early. I tried to update my blog but it wouldn't let me for some stupid reason. It was super stupid.  At 3:45 we went to go pickup Beka. On the way there I tried to get myself hyper so we turned on some oldies but they were playing really depressing music so Hannah and I just ended up turning the radio off and making our own music. Then Beka came in the car and we were all like "lalallalalallala" We finally got the airport and like 4:30. We were the first people there! It was crazy because everyone else was all concerened about getting htere 2 hours early [wow I just seenzed and got snot all over my jacket. Now that was atractive.]  So we got on our plane and that was pretty uneventful except this hot guy Beka liked sat near us and Beka was like "0OOOH!"   We had a layover in San Jose and I called Mandy. But being the smart person I am known to be I stood right in front of a  loud speaker and I couldn't hear anything she said and I doubt she heard anythign I said. Haha.  We got on another plane and finally arived in Ontario. Then Jackie Heather and I waited for Beka and Rhonda to show up with the rental car. They finally came and we all boarded the car to disney land.  Disney land was so frekaing scary. I thought I was going to die numerous times. But, I went on all the rides [Including splash mountain!] and I had a really good time.  But who cares about that?  Then we all loaded into the car off to San Diego. We got stuck in a traffic jam at MIDNIGHT! It was the weirdest thing ever.  We finally arrived at the Hilton and like 3 and we fell asleep so after our arrival.  At 8 I woke up and I was SUPER excited because I would get to meet all the other IMPROV PEOPLE! I mean really, husband potential.    I took a nice shower and blow dryed my hair with the crappy hotel dryer. I looked pretty good if I do say so myself.  SO we went to the Yacht club. At first I was really scared but after I met the first few people it was simply wonderful. At CYT Vancouver I always feel untalented, unatractive, and shy. But these people made me feel beautiful. They made me feel like i had self worth.   it was great.  We played this game called american eagle 1-2-3. It was SO scary but awesomely fun. There were two people in the middle of the beach and you had to run by them without getting picked up. They would pick up and yell "AMERICAN EAGLE 1-2-3" then throw you on the ground before you touched it. It was fun! I lost so soon though. I think it's because I don't weigh much, i'm and easy target. :) This guy who was probably 16 just picked me up then "dink" set me back on the sand. I am glad I didn't get injured! :)  Then I met the pink team. We ate lunch with them. They were SO awesome!!! This one guys name was David Hott! Hahhahaha. For the rest of the day I just called him the Hott one. Hahhaa. He was pretty atractive, but not my type.  After a day at the yacht club we went back to our hotel room to rest but we didn't get much rest. I called Mandy and got to talk to her for a long time which was nice. Then I called my Mumsy. :)  Then we went to In and Out burger! YUM!!!!!  After that we practiced for along time. But I REALLY wanted to go to the Bingo party to hand out with all these cool people. But, alas, we were 30 minutes late. It was still a lot of fun though! I met this girl named Jen whof or her summer job dressed up like orky the Otter at Sea world! Hahhaha. Then I met Andrew....*sigh* He is so beautiful.  Back to the Bingo party.  So, I totally lost. Hahaha. It was not cool. BUt it didn't really matter because most of the time I talked to all the cool people. I cannot get over how cool they all were. I wish we all lived in the same town so I could see them all everyday.  After the bingo party I was just haning around tlaking to people and for some reaosn Jen started kicking me jokingly so we got into this "huge" fight. It rocked.  Then Beka made me leave to go pratice. On our way to the elevators I saw andrew and his cute friend [not to mention they didn't have shirts on. wow that sounded really bad. I am never saying that again!!] and they were like "Do you wanna go swimming with us??" and I was like "DO I EVER" but I couldn't because we had to practice. It was sad.  SO we went to bed at like 2 and woke up at 8 for the Improvathon.  It was fun.  I don't really want to expand on it because I only have 10 minutes left of time on this library computer butttt...  We got there at about 12:30 and just hung out with our team. I REALLY wanted to hang out with the other people but I couldn't. Then it started. We did SUPER good on our two games but for some reason the judges hated us so we got out in the first round. Afterwards allllllll these people we had never seen before came up to us and were like "You guys were cheated out of your first place title!" Everyone on our team was SUPER upset and they were all crying. But for some reason I didn't feel that sad. I geuss I should have, but i wasn't.  Then we left and I didn't get to say good bye to the pink team which made me really sad...  Then we went to Fuddruckers. I got to hang out some with Andrew and His mom. We talked about the Beatles like the whole time. Andrews mom was met PAUL MCCARTNEY. I was so jealous. Paul is andrews favorite beatle tooo. I love that boy.  Oh no my time is almost up so I shall say one shocking detail of my trip, I HUGEED GUYS. LOTS OF THEM! But I didn't get to hug andrew which was quite sad.....so here is my officail list of *doo de doo*  GUYS LAURA HUGEED! Justin Tim Ben Kendrick   ooh crap. I forgot everyones names.  Haha  Well I hugged like 4 other guys. Look at me gooo! Wow. This was a weird post. I will post more tomorrow. I LOVE YOU GUYS!  Laura Fantora

            Before I get to the whole heat stroke thing.... I will start from the beginning!!  We [mum and I] set off on our great Kerry adventure at aproximetly 9:23 AM. We arrived in Portland at about 9:50. We hoped out of the car and walked to the river front. There were a TON of people. We found the correct line and stoof there. The line moved soooo slow!!! We finally got into the place about an hour later. I was quite pleased because last time I saw Kerry we didn't even get into line before the gates were closed...  So we stood there and waited. And waited... then a bunch of people came up to speak. First was the mayor. Then a congressman. Then another congressman whose name was Mr. Wu!! [I met him earlier.]   Then came Leonardo Dicaprio. Hahhahah!! He informed us that he was an environmentalist. The crowd cheered. [i love portland.]  After his little schpeel he sat down. Then, up came Mr. Bon Jovi!! I didn't really like him. I like more upbeat music. Maybe he didn't play his bests though.  Then, after he left the stage we stood there. For like a half an hour...until suddenly they played some music, which I dubbed the "Royal Procession Song", and then came Kerrys bus!! It drove right by us then out popped Kerry. He waved, shook hands, and we all cheered, very loud.  Teresa came out and talked for like an hour. We were like GO AWAY!!! because we were all quite hot and all she was talking about was like "woman power" Haha.  At this point I was QUITEEEE hot and dehidrated. I just had to sit down. So that I did.   Then I started to feel like I was going to throw up. So my mom was like "Do you wanna go back to where it is less crowded?" [it was like amosh pit of 20,000+ people!] so I was like "Ok." So I stood up but then I just collapsed. My vision went all black and I couldn't see a thing. I felt like I was going to die. So suddenly, out of nowhere [my mom says it was an angel, that I can beileve] this doctor lady comes and starts to check my pulse. "Call 911!!!! Does anyone have a cellphone?"  So I was like "Great, now I am dying." My mom then poured a bunch of water that this lady [other angel!!] gave us all over me.   The whoel tiem I was like  praying "God don't let me die!!!!!!!"  I really though I was going to die. My mom said I was as white as a sheet and my skin was all cold. When that doctor lady took my hand to check my pulse it felt just like God was holding my hand. It was crazy!!   So they called 911 but decided not to put me in an ambulance until the on site  meds checked me out. Since I could not walk they asked the 911 people to send a strecher. Haha.  So the doctor lady tried to tell them where we were, but since we were surrounded by 20,000+ people they could not find us!  So I drank like 6 bottles of water and I could walk again so my mom and I walked until we found Secret Service Man [it only took like 5 minutes] he escorted us to the medical area and they check my pulse and all. By then I was feeling a bit better so they gave me like 6 more bottles of water [which I drank in like 7 minutes!] they also gave me this cold thing which thay placed on the back of my neck. It felt nice!! Hahaa.   I finally got better enough so I wasn't dieing. But, by then, Kerry was almost done speaking so I missed the whole thing!! Haha. The nice ambulance man got me some posters though. Haha!  It was totally fun though!!!!  Then we walked back to the car [the whole time i still felt like I was dying but I didn't want to tell my mom because she would probably take me to the hospital and that's no fun!!]  My mom took me to Burgerville and let me get all the food I wanted becuase she was like "I thought you were dead and now I have my Laura back!!"  Hahhahaha  Expect pictures in the near future.  I am off to sleep, I must rest my dying soul!! ;)

            Beka came over today right after the play. Yay! We had root beer floats. It was good.  When Beka was leaving she made me walk her to her car because she was afraid of the dark. Haha. Before she left she was like "I need to come over sometime during the day!" and I was like "okkk!!!!!" But I forgot to ask her if she could come to the switchfoot concert. Oh well. I will call her tomorrow!

          Hello dear friends!!  Today I woke up at 9 and started cleanning. I didn't finish till about a half an hour ago.  It took forever!! But the good thing is I made a lot of money!! Now I can buy my switchfoot tickets tonight before they sell out!!

Fun.  :)  My mom is getting all mad at me because she says i'm a slob. I don't see a thing wrong with not folding ones clothing!!!

            Where has my childhood gone?  I am almost 15. It seems like now I must finally face life. I have been avoiding it for so long. I mean...i can't turn back. I can no longer be the innocent 7 year old. I have to take DRIVERS ED!! I never want to drive. That's why I am going to move to a big city so I can just take public transportation. Driving scares me. I don't want to kill any person or and animal. That would make me cry for days and months...maybe even years.  See...now I am a sophmore. Now I have to learn how to drive and take the PSAT.  Before I know it I will be a junior and I will take the SAT and apply to colleges.  Then I will be a senior. I will have to finish my high school years..  And then I am off to college.  A foreign land.  All by myself...  I seems pretty scary. I mean really...4 years from know I will be by myself at this huge univeristy.  It just scares me.  Why can't I just stay this age?  I am 14.   I can get away with being immature...like trying to see how many grapes I can fit in my mouth yet I can also act years older than I.  I don't have to go to any job interveiws because money isn't important.  I don't have to try to be "all grown up" because I know I am so young.  But, alas, I will  never be the little girl I once was...    And that makes me sad.  Why does one have to grow up at the age of 14?  Why must I be thrust into the world at so young?  Can't I just stay here...at my mommies side

            I left my brothers lap-top on today and the battery ran dead. he is quite mad becuase he is going star gazing on Mt. Saint Helens tonight and he needs his lap-top.  Tonight we went to my Aunt Sharons house. I visited my cousins pet rats. Haha! They were cuteeee! They like sniffed my fingers and stuff! Haha!  Well, that audio for blogger thing absolutely rocks. I would totally check it out: www.audioblogger.com  The only problem is you have to call this number to record a message and the number is long distance. I have to use my mom or dads cellphone to get it to work.  Yup yup.  I am not feeling very talkative...adios!

            What makes something a masterpeice?     Why is a can of cambels soup in the Museum of Modern Art in New York? [Andy Warhol, 1953]  Why is this one of the most published paintings in the World?     [Vangogh  Starry Night ]  Art is a very subjective thing.  It seems like we should have a set of rules that makes art "good."  For one, this may seem beautiful:   [Jackson Pollock  One ]  Yet others think it was just a childs splatter.  Personally, I love this painting:   [Peit Mondrain]  But others may think its just a series of squares.  I love art that captures imagination.  I don't like art that is just like a bowl of fruit. I mean, I lok at it and I think "Oh, a lovely bowl of fruit..." it doesn't cause me to imagine what the artist was thinking when he or she formed the art.   [Andy Warhol   self Portait ]  Why did he paint this? What is his story? Why does this look so creepy? :)  I think art should be something that should portray God. Not like a picture of some guy sitting on a cloud...but maybe  reflecting his beauty. Reflecting his power..  Art should make you think up to God.  I know you probably never think deep about art, neither do I.  But it is quite and interesting and confusing topic to ponder.

           5 o'clock.  I turn on the television...  What do I see?  Signs of hate.   Unhurled emotions.  People are dying.  Children and crying.  I see...  a world full of hate  a world full of death  Destruction.  Where is the good?  Where is love?  I need love...  In world full of depression...  Suppression  Cruelity  Disdain  Animosity  Malevolence  Resentment  I know it's there somewhere....  Is it out of my grasp?  Surrounded.  Like the walls of a great city.  I cannot escape it.  The hate is everywhere.  I know love is also everywhere.  Then why must I focus on the disdain?  Why must our world only see the problems rather than the solutions?  What about the 9 year old who raised 400,000 dollars to fight cancer?  No one hears about Alex.  Now she has parted from our world...  Just a word in a novel.  A stroke on a canvas.  What about the man who gave a dollar to a homeless lady?  No one will hear his story.  Why can't the news focus on the amazing love that is everywhere in this world?  Love is everywhere.  We just have to look past the sorrow.  See the mother and her child living on the street?  The mother starves so her child can have a little food.  Why is not this rewarded?  I guess I will find out when my page in the novel is completed.

            Since today is the first officail day of  urlLink  Summer Festival  at New Heights, they are having their annual picnic!! They have the craziest picnics. Our church is so rich that they have all those huge inflatable bouncy things. They also have all free food and such. I love our church.  My mom is obbsessed with volunteering [and so am I!! Hence the carrot! (inside joke. Haha.)] she volunteered everyone in my family to help! It shall be fun though. I get to be in charge of one of the inflatables. mwa haha. I hope I get to bounce on it!! Those things rock. So I get to play with little kids all day!! Yay!!!! I hope none of them get hurt....I will feel quite guilty.  ANDDD.....  Later today.....   MANDY IS COMING!!!!  I haven't seen her since spring break which is quite quite sad. They have already been in the car for like 7 hours!!!! Cuh-razy!!!  Last night Hannah and I made her a welcome poster. Haha. Well, acctually, Hannah made it! She is SO artistic. I wrote the word "MANDY" and it looks SO bad. Haha. Then the part she did is like gorgeous. Haha. It's a pretty sue-wheat poster. You all will have to see it when you come on Monday. [well..not all of you..but yeah...]  I can't wait till Mandy comes!!  According to MapQuest it should take 11 hours 14 minutes.  That means they should be here at like 5!!! Woohoo!!  Maybe I can get my mom to let us all go to Pizza Schmizza. So good!!  A couple days ago we were just driving around and there were all those political signs everywhere and I saw this one sign and it said "Elect Schmizza For Dinner!" It was SOOO fun-knee!!!  I better go, talk to you all later!!!!  Love, laura Fantora

         How can I save the world you may ask? It's easy!!! Just follow these simple instructions and you too can be a world saver!!!    First, think of a superhero idenity. I am quite fond of Captain Underpants. Some other creative superhero include Charles: The Most Stupendous Superhero This Side of the Bermuda Triangle [that was of my brothers doing.], Pretty Ugly Man, Razmataz Man, Giant Lady, ETC. Get creative!!    Next you need to decide on your specail skill. Charles, for instance, is an expert hair braider. Make sure you choose your talent wisley!! [You need to save the world you know.]    Ok. So now you should have the following: A name for you alter-ego and a special talent. [You might want to write these down just incase you forget!]    Next, make up a problem that youcan solve using for special talent.    Pretend your Charlie....    OH NO!!!! THE WORLD'S HAIR IS A MESS!!    I think they need a hair braider...you [Charlie] think to yourself.    Now, You must need some to yell when your saving the poor World.    Something like "Never fear, Charlies here!!"    But, if you were the REAL Charlie you would probably want to say "I AM HERE TO RID YOU AND YOUR POSSE OF HAIR PROBLEMS!"    Then, you would undergo the most postive aspect of being a superhero, WILD APPLAUSE!!    Now, you must scilence the crowd and get to work- this isn't all fun and games!    Here is your chance to use your newling bestowed gifting.    Be safe! Over confidence is one of Charlies greatest enemys. You may think it's of his own doing but Over Confidence is the name of his enemy.    Here comes the fun part, CREATE YOUR OWN ENEMY!    Charlie chose Over Confidence because it was so ironic. I mean really, Charlie, over confident. Hah!    You may chose something else. Like Evil Spam Man for instance.    Instead of chosing a specail talent for your very own Spam Man, chose one of his weaknesses. Maybe he is fat so he can't fit through small spaces, ya never know.    Now your set!!!! With your super specail talent of hair braiding and your overwhelming knowlede of all your greatest enemys weaknesses YOU CAN SAVE THE WORLD!!!    Have fun kids, and be safe!! [and you thought I was going to make you feed the poor!!]    Love,    laura Fantora

            About a month ago I gave away one of my Gmail invites on this handy site called urlLink Gmail Swap.  [That site has kinda gone down the hill now...]  In exchange for a Gmail account this guy named Guillermo promised to send me a bag of coffee from Costca Rica. I hate coffee, but my dad and my brother love it so I agreed.  After almost a month it didn't come so I was just like whatever...liar face!!  But then today, it came!!! Surprisingly, it smells very good. It was acctually sent from costa rica!! It must have cost a lot to send it from there, I am eternally grateful. :)  Today I just took a shower, it was very nice. I feel clean!  Then I checked the mail and got my "tasty" coffee.  Now I should be cleaning my room is preperation for the visit of Mandy tomorrow.  I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!  She is leaving tomorrow from Cali at 5 AM!!! She should be at my house fairly late the same day.  *so excited*

            2 lives...  changed forever.  That morning the road was slick...  The rain came fastly down...as if a thousand bullets peirced through the sky.  The elderly couple laughed together as they traversed through the winding road.  They were returning home after a weekend spent in happiness together on the coast.  Who knew this would be there last moments together.  Suddenly, the man the drivers seat raised up his left arm to strach his tired eyes...  "Watch out honey!!" shouted the woman as a deer calmy pranced accross the road.  The man quickly turned to the left to avoid killing the graceful deer.  The car left the control on the mans sweaty grasp.   The car quickly flew on the hill.  The man didn't dare to even breath  as his entire future left his grasp.  The woman sat there, eyes bulged out.  She leaned over and kissed her husband on the cheek. He didn't even turn...  All this happened in a matter of seconds.   The woman slowly opened her eyes. She was alarmed by what she saw...  There car, which they had bought only a month before, was now as curvy as the sea on a stormy day.   Slowly she looked out the window, which was now just a few fragments of broken glass.  They were in the middle of an uncharted forest.  "How did we get here?" she quitley spoke.  Then the whole thing came back to her momory...  "we were....tumbling.."  She tried to move her legs but she had lost all feeling.  Then she remembered, Frank. Her husband of almost 50 years.  She tried to move her head.  It hurt like the the fire of a thousand suns.  She had to see Frank.  At this time Frank was worth all the pain she had to endure to see him.  Frank's head was bowed down and his hands were heald together, a sign of love to his God.  "Frank!" the woman yelled.  He didn't move. His eyes did not open.  At once her worst fear was realized...Frank was dead.  She closed her eyes.  A single tear graced down her cheek.  As if opening a dam a river of tears flowed.  Moments later she heard the sirens.  "Are you all right?" The fireman rushed to the side of the car...  "Frank..he's dead..."  "Help is on the way." The fireman tried to calm her shatered heart when suddenly more medical technitions rushed to her side.  "We will get you out of here...everything will be ok."  She didn't feel anymore calm then before they came.  She wished they would just leave her alone so she could die here, next to Frank.  In a matter of minutes she was in an ambulance.  "Where is Frank?" she demanded.  "Frank isn't here..." said the driver of the car.  Suddenly, the fast moving car came to a stop.  "What's going on?" the lady asked  "We need to get you out of here."  She wished she could see outside but there were no windows on the ambulance.  All she could hear was the engines of...maybe 20 cars.     "Why are we stopped?"  Suddenly her own life became something of importance...she didn't want to sit here, she needed to go to the hospital.  "We are waiting for the helecopter."  Suddenly, a childish excitment reached her nerves..  "A...a...helecopter? but, sir, i'm afraid of heights.."  She heard a loud engine...something...something landed but 10 feet from where they sat.  "It's here, we need to get her out of here."    She was carried out of the ambulance and into the helecopter...  ______  It seems like everything happened so fast.  I don't know if this was how the story went, but I saw it all with my own eyes.  It happened on our way home from the beach...  It seems like lives can be changed in such a short time...

            Today I went to the home depot. It was alright. I just hung out in the cedar isle like I always do. I am OBSESSED with Cedar. It smells so stinkin' good. Oh my goodnesss. I wish my parents would have named me Cedar. Isn't that the coolest name ever? It just makes me sound tall and confident. Strong.  But alas, I was named Laura!! Haha. not that Laura is a bad name...  I told my dad that  I wanted to change my name to Cedar and he was like "Uh..it's a cool name..i guess."  Then we went to safeway and I picked out a sherbert [that's a cool name toooo!] and then Jacob was like "lets get sorbet instead." So I was like "Ok." SO we picked out a tasty lemon sorbet. But then right before we paid for it he was like "You know what..I want peach instead" so he got peach without even consulting me!! Little did he know I hate peach so no sorbet for me.  Oh well. I am quite content with my cookie dough.   DOUUUGHHHHHHH  Dou-ugh!  hahahaha  [inside joke. mwa haha]

            WARNING: This is a nasty Laura alert.  Laura is in a bad mood- stay away.  So.  Whatever I say will probably offend at least one of my readers so I will just not talk at all.  I have found that when I talk I just weave myself into more and more trouble..  I have decided to never go to school and live in my room. Now I will never have to face people..or anything.  Why have I come to this important decision you ask?  Because people make me mad.  [if you are sick of me complaining just ignore my rambeling]  See, wherever I go it seems as if people don't care about what I have to say. Like if people listened, I would talk. but they don't seem to want to listen so i don't talk...  Well, Mandy listens. But she is a rare exception.  It seems like everyone is caught up with there own lifes and stuff that I seem to just be whisked away with the wind.  Oh well.  It's kinda fun to be my own best friend.  I have common intrests with my best friend.  We go EVERY where together...  humph.

            Where have all my friends gone?  Just wondering.  No one is online anymore and no one posts comments anymore...  sad.  Did I tell you Kerry is coming to Portland on Friday? I am quite excited.  But, I have a delima.  See, I was invited to this party at this girl  I barley knows house. So I said I could go..just because I have nothing better to do.  Then Heather invited me and all the HYPE kids to an olympics party and that sounds TOTALLY fun. Just because I will be with heather, Beka, Jacki, and everyone.  And now Kerry is coming.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!  Morally, I should go the that girls house for her party because I already told her I could go...but I don't really want to. I want to go to Heathers!!  Hum...  This weekend should be interesting...  Tomorrow..I am going to church. I think that's all..  Church should be alright.  I get to see Beka..but then again I have to go to "teen" church which isn't fun.  Hum hum.  Dude.  I can't think of anything interesting to say today.  Ooh! It just said on the news that Bush is coming to Portland on friday tooo! Haha!  I will totally see Kerry cuz you have to either pay or be a total Bush freak to go to his events. That's why I like Kerry, he lets all people come to his brohahas.  Yup.

           In some way or form, then I don't know what will.  [from bbc.com]  Armenian Refugees     Lida is a refugee. She lives with her four children and elderly mother. Armen, 12, Mariam, 10, Artur, 3, and Maria, five months, are undernourished. They haven’t got money even for a minimum ration.  Sometimes Lida picks bones at a meat market. After boiling them she makes a "soup". It's the children's favourite meal. They call it "meat soup".     Lida uses plastic bags as a fuel for the stove. There are plenty of them in the marketplace. Burning plastic bags releases lots of smoke. Faces, curtains, clothes - everything is covered in soot.  Lida used to be a prostitute. Now she earns a little money buying cheap cigarettes at a border market and selling them locally. It's not enough.    Three-year-old Artur has a bath everyday. He has to wait his turn after his younger sister Maria. By the time he gets into the water it is lukewarm and dirty, but he enjoys it anyway. He can spend hours in the tub.  At the end he is not completely clean but at least some of the soot is gone.    Lida's mother, Asya, is 75. She lost her passport and she doesn't get any pension. Asya looks after Maria.  She feeds her, changes her nappies and does whatever she can to look after the baby.    Despite every effort the house is in a sorry condition. Dirt and soot covers everything. Older children don’t help Lida much. Little Artur thinks it's all a game. He doesn’t know any better.    Washing up is part of the everyday routine. The house doesn't have running water, so Lida brings water from a spring and does her washing outside.  Older children usually sit and watch her doing the washing. Clothes become more or less clean for a short period - and then get covered in soot again.     Lida's children don’t play with other kids. They don't go to school or out and about.  They avoid other people. But they often play together, are close to each other and look after little Maria in turns.   --------------  That is the saddest story I have ever heard in my life. The pictures.. wow.  I just makes me want to do something for these children...for their mother...for their grandmother.  It breaks my heart to see people in this condition. But, this is the fact of life for thousands of people all around the world.  Why then do we still buy 24 dollar shirts? 50 dollar jeans?  We could do so much with that money. Instead of purchasing some clothes we could feed a whole family for a month..  it just breaks me up inside.

         Wow!! Haha. This is crazy. I have never blogged from a PC before. At the moment, my lovely brother Matt is using my Imac so I must stoop as low as to use my eldest brothers [Jacob] lapot. Fun stuff.  Have all you guys read the verse on the right column?? It's one of my favorites.  We are supposed to be transformed by the renewing of our mind!!! This means that we are transformed through learning. I just wanted to chalenge you all instead of laying around all day like a normal summer, read! Write! Explore!! Do something. Learn. God didn't create us to be lazy!!!   Today I went to this concert in the park. it was pretty spiffy!! It was this awesome band who just played the beatles and such. They even played some queen!!! There were these two guys dressed up as hippies and they went into the very front and started dancing and the lead singer dude was like "WHOA!! We have some real live hippies right by our stage!!" they had signs that sad "Love, Peace, and chicken wings" it was quite amusing.   I checked out the menu for the thai place and the most expensive meal you can get cost 12 bucks. If you are really cheap you can just get rice for a dollar. Haha. I am quite excited.  MANDY COMES SOON!  Be excited, very excited.

           Have I told you how much I despise fashion?  [coming from the yearbooks freshman "most fashionable"]  I am so serious.  its evil, yet so addicting.  it's something I totally strugle with.  At CYT camp my mom sent me a package with a teen vogue and lucky mag in it.  Karsen was like "wow!! Your mom loves you!"  People who love me don't tempt me with fashion magazines.  I know my mom didn't know..but still.  See, there was a time when i was obsessed with fashion.  Like so obsessed I would check style.com EVERY day. Multiple times a day just to make sure I was on top of all the trends.  This was not a long time ago..November of last year.  I started to see all the models.  I know you hear this a lot how people "compare themselves to anorexic models" I heard it so much. I never thought it happened to real people.      Even though I only weighed a hundred and fifteen pounds I still  thought I was fat. I tried to loose weight and got down to 105. but I still wasn't happy.     All those models always look so happy.  Now, over six months later, I finally realize how unhappy they really are.  There smiles are like a canvas they paint on every day.  I was slowly becoming one of them...  I was so sad.  I tried and I tried but no guy would ever like me.  No modeling agency would ever want me.  No one would ever want me as there friend.  I felt so unwanted.  Later I realized how foolish I was being.  Really, I looked way better at my normal 120 pounds.  God slowly seeped into my life in ways I still do not understand.  For some reason I would start to pick up my bible instead of lucky magazine.  Soon, my reading of lucky was extint. Along with vogue and every other fashion magazine.  Still, it remains a struggle.  I love fashion, I admit I do.  But there is so much more than the crap media wants to sell you.  So, my friend, STAY AWAY FROM FASHION MAGAZINES! Throw them in the trash! Burn 'em!!   Never make the mistake I did, ok?

            So. We had to go to the beach with my dads best friends family..I then had to hang out with these two girls the whole time. They were scary.  This girl who was my age..we were walking around town and she was like "OH MY GOSH. I GOT DIRT ON MY SHOES! these cost 150 dolllars!" I almost puked. Not to mention she was flinging around her 500 dollar Louis Vuitton purse. Yuck.  Well, that described my week. Haha. I saw the ice cream man. Haha.  But yeah.  Then tonight i went to HYPE which was great fun. I ate a hamburger!  The end...

            So, I am going to join the Comedy Sportz high school league!!! Anyone else want to do it to? It's on saturdays from 12-2. It will be awesomely FUN!! I am quite excited. Improv is SO addicting. It's great...  Did I tell you I am going to the beach tomorrow? Well, I am. And, I heard Evan is going to be there too so I better not see him. Haha. My dads close friend [he was in my parents wedding..] is coming up from Lousiana. They have a daughter my age and another duaghter my sisters age so it should be fun. I haven't seen 'em since AI was like 10 or 11, but from what I remember they were cool.  I will ABSOLUTELY escape from the beach house and update my blog. Absolutely meaning I will ride down in the lugage carrier [some of my friends now what I am talking aboooot] and run out the garage to update my blog. Well, acctually, i'm not stupid enough to do that, but we'll see.  i was watching the 10 o'clock news and that policeman who died did go to my church. The reason I know this was because my pastor was on the television..he looked sad...   Have an awesome week ya'll.  BTW, e-mail me whenever!! Haha. This is just a "selfless" pitch to make myself feel special by not getting junk mail.  fantora[at] gmail.com  fun stuff.

            Due to the photo paper crisis, my  mom thought it would be fun to mozy on over to the brand spankin new target about 10 minutes from our house. I was quite excited because I thoroughly enjoy tagrets of all shapes and sizes.  But, alas, we arrived at the Target at 9:05, 5 minutes after it closed. I was quite disapointed because I was going to purchase a pretty alarm clock I saw in the Target ad today. My current alarm clock is broken, which obviously doesn't help me to get up.  Kinda disapointing but oh well, there is always next time.  So, instead, we went to Fred Meyer. I got photo paper and conditioner. Woot wooot. :)  Dude, I just realized how young I really am. I am 14. 14!!! I am a sopmore. Does this even make sense? I should be like an eigth grader. Haha. But, I am quite proud of my maturness. I'm not trying to brag, but I seem like a pretty mature 14 year old.  I cannot wait till I am 15. 14 just seems so YOUNG!  Like, when I tell people I am 14 they are just like "oh.." and they kinda look down on me. See, I don't really look like a 14 year old...  But yeah... 33 days till I am FINALLY 15!!

            Today we had to pick up my dad and my brothers from Mt. Ranier. They went on a 50 miles hike around half of the bottom of  la montana. Fun..haha. They are cuh-razy!! I didn't really want to go but my sister wanted to go and I HATE being home alone..so I went. It was alright. We got to go to starbucks for breakfeast so I got a PUMPKIN SCONE! So good. I get htose everytime I go to a starbucks. woot woot. Then I slept the whole way to the mountain [aboot 2.5 hours] once we got there I was like "Wheres the mountain?" see, there were So many trees you could barley see the "biggest mountain in the lower 48 states" [according to tour guide mom] It didn't seem that big. Mt. Saint Helens seems WAY bigger than it. Maybe because I have grown up with mountains. I always see them out my bedroom window. Whenever we leave the house you stare at them out the window. They are just kinda..there. Ever beautiful, never leaving. Well, the snow come and goes but the mountain is always there.  So we hiked a half mile and met up with my manly family [Haha!! That rhymed! well kinda...] they were stinky, smelly, but happy. They only got one shower all week. They smelled so bad!! I was like "Wow..what is that weird smell?" "Uh...that would be me!"  then we went out to lunch at this nasty little restaurant..[wel the food was fine..it just looked nasty.]  And then we went home!! Woooo woooo!!  I should be at church right now but I became enthraled with making my birthday list that I seem to have "forgotten" the time. Oh well. I didn't really want to go anyways. High school church is just so blah. Everything they teach is SO simple. I know Jesus loves me,  can we move onto something more complex? Like Judism..or something!! Or would that be o complex for our growing minds to take?  I like going to big church [new heights slang for where the pastor preaches!] SO MUCH! We acctually learn a ton. Everyone thinks it's so boring but it totally isn't.  Did you hear about that police man in the couv who got ran over when responding to a house call? I think he went to my church. I was watching the news today and I saw the news lady in front of my church. They were talking about him and how the funeral is going to be at "New Heights Batist Church."  Who was I with when I was talking about denominations? Because our church doesn't really vocalize the denomination ever so this person told me that meant we were non-denominational but I could have sworn I was Baptist [haha!] I guess I was correct.  My birthday is in 34 days!!! Well, after tonight it will be 33! But, "sad" news, I am not having a birthday party this year. Woohoo! I am excited because parties and having people over totally stresses me out. Because everything has to be perfect and organized or else I totally freak. And I don't have really any time to be planning a big brouhaha.   Ooh! I wrote a really cool preachy story thing! But I don't know if I will post it yet, I am saving it for HYPE! I think we are all going to take turns doing the "talk." I can't wait. I love to preach but people don't usually listen...
