      Had a great day with Sonal today. A long overdue visit with Purvi and the kids - and I'm glad that they got to connect.&nbsp; Last night we were up till 2:00 discussing all these business ideas - the one about negotiation strategy for IMF loans was the most appealing, and I think I'll actually work on that.&nbsp; Lunch at Sonal's relatives - turns out the uncle (Dhiren Kaka?) was in the handicrafts business for a while, and I asked him about the potential of the US market (keeping the Craftsbridge opportunity in mind). His biggest concern was warehouse space bec. of the large vendor commitments in the US. Worth exploring though. Then the highlight of the day - a 4 hour 'tea' at Shariq's place in Menlo Park.&nbsp; Gosh, I don't think I can remember all the places the conversation meandered to, punctuated by tea, guest entry by Dipti (and a neighbouring dog).&nbsp; We talked about everything from research in the development sector, to this idea of unlocking people's potential (Raghu was animated about this point, and I was in disagreement, which made it interesting), and doing a training for philanropists, so they know where they want their money to go! Dinner at Jing Jing, with the soup-nazi in attendance and Shariq's question of the hour "How do you know when to turn down an opportunity to affect change? Does the universe truly provide an answer, and a calling?" And the other phrase of the day: "It's all about intention"&nbsp; On the way back from the airport, I unloaded all my latest&nbsp;issues on a hapless Dipti.&nbsp; Came back home to field a phone call, that I apparently ought to have been more excited about.&nbsp; Never mind that I was trying to keep my voice down since everyone was sleeping. Expectations make me claustrophobic.

      Off late, I've been noticing perfect strangers and thinking to myself - "I wonder how they will die? ".&nbsp;The&nbsp;certainty of the event is astounding and has been occupying my mind.&nbsp; We all are in fact&nbsp;hurtling&nbsp;towards death at the speed of time, and&nbsp;I guess it makes me sad to know that every single person walking around out there will sooner or later be ambushed by pain.&nbsp; I also wonder, about this remarkable ability we have to  not  feel other people's pain. I'm not sure if its a blessing or a curse.&nbsp; Foolishly I learn nothing from the pain of others, because I do not suffer. I carry on with my prescribed pointless activities, till one day...wham! a broken neck, maybe. Or paralysis. Or heart failure. And I look around and what do I find? People everywhere going about their business as if nothing happened.&nbsp;Some attempts to reach out,&nbsp;but they too&nbsp;have lives to lead, and pointless activities to return to. Sonal is in SF, and my dashing dynamic household social venture capitalist grandpa &nbsp;of 92, handed me a&nbsp;100$ bill spontaneously for Indicorps,   unsolicited  , I swear. Help comes from unexpected places. In unexpected forms.&nbsp; At unexpected times.  Be open to the possibilities.

      ...I think I'm ready to move on. I went to meditation yesterday, and they have the post meditation discussion on the thought for the day. It has struck me in the past, and more acutely yesterday, that all this intellectual gymastics around discussing profound thoughts in a forum is well intentioned, but it also creates room for inflating that which we are attempting to destroy -the ego. To be conscious of being profound, to be conscious of serving others, is to fall into the same trap of attachment to pride, attention, recognition etc. I noticed very few unique,individual thoughts in the room yesterday. Most of it was reiteration of banalities, cliche's and borrowed profoundness. People subtly, gently vying for attention as they struggled to say something that would impress others. We don't SPEAK of brushing our teeth, or loving our parents. We don't DISCUSS waking up in the morning. Then why do we discuss love and charity and service and spirituality if it indeed springs as naturally for everybody as they claim it does? There is a certain forcedness to service, to compassion, to spirituality when it is discussed and intellectualized. And I think this undermines the intensly personal nature of these things. And I don't think that a bunch of people getting together add much to that equation. Of course I love these peeps and I think they are all amazing. I also think that what they have to offer is valuable to some people at some time. But not all people, and certainly not all of the time. So I guess I'm saying, I'm either not one of those people anymore, or its past that time...

      Of course it was an extraordinarily mediocre day at work. Visited Pitchpine right after work (but not before wolfing down those scary good waffles at 450!)&nbsp;, with intentions to spend time with ba/bapuji, but they weren't ready, and by the time they came out, I had to run an errand, involving a very pregnant sister-in-law. This was good, bec. I got to spend unexpected time with her and Vivek and Riya,&nbsp;BUT not wanting to dissapoint the grandparentals,&nbsp;I read to them from Aptavani 1, which in turn made me late for meditation, and then of course I missed the exit.&nbsp; Beautifully and extraordinarily, I wasn't the slightest bit upset at any of this&nbsp;- just kind of watching the flow of things.&nbsp; But then I didn't have a good meditation, and that got me semi-dissapointed!&nbsp; So close, so close, but yet....&nbsp; Anyway, so the good people of Chromite Dr. were wonderful to see again and all, but increasingly the impact is declining.&nbsp; Call me a skeptic, but I'm finding the post-med discussions a bit forced, increasingly inane, unnecessarily intellectual and somewhat pointless.&nbsp; I felt caught in the cross-fire of cliche's today. I chose to abstain, so as not to add to the casualty of concepts.&nbsp; Give me a nice protracted argument one-on-one anyday. I'm pretty excited that Sonal's going to be here this Thursday!

      So...the "Movie (and sometimes Book) Club", had its first&nbsp;event today at Taz's place.&nbsp; I must have been enjoying myself, considering I was hanging about till 2&nbsp;am on a working day. &nbsp;I know what it was - couldn't tear myself away from all those debates. The movie 'Satta', was quite mediocre.&nbsp;The real problem was that it didn't really say anything about people empowering themselves. Why is it always about good leaders and bad leaders - is it so hard to&nbsp;concieve of people, actual everyday normal live people galvanizing into action to create something positive? Anyway, Mehul (M)&nbsp;was all over that. Then of course we got into discussions of the politics of poverty, with M vehemently claiming that to label social service as a higher type of work, than, say working in corporate America, was just propoganda. Yeah, but my point was,&nbsp; that if the same unit of work has higher impact (whatever the measure of impact is defined to be), in one community over another, it does make sense to deem it as 'better'.&nbsp; Now to measure impact, I would argue that 10 drastic advances ought to be weighed more than a 1000 incremental advances that the same amount of work brings, especially if it involves peoples lives and livelihood (I dunno, like curing 10 deathly ill people, vs. giving haircuts to 1000 people or something).&nbsp; I see it as the same as the theory of competitive advantage with some clauses added on, so that in addition to saying, what am I better at producing, you would ask, and which of those products will make society  most  better off.&nbsp; Surya (S) &nbsp;pointed out a couple of interesting and disettling things during the course of the conversation.&nbsp; First, this model in economics that shows that poverty is inevitable. The simulation starts with 1000 people who have 1000$ each.&nbsp; Every turn of the simulation they give up one dollar to a random person from amongst the group. They may or may not recieve a dollar in return.&nbsp; Over time (and with the constraint of no borrowing allowed, so min is 0$), the distribution apparently settles into a disquieting scenario where 20% of the population posesses about 80% of the wealth.&nbsp; The assumptions of the model, specially the random nature of the money exchange is definitely up for debate.&nbsp; The other flaw I saw, is that it may not be possible to curb the natural distribution, but it should be possible to set a lower limit on the poverty, through skill-set building in real life. And anyway, people are not statistics - there is something to be said for a visceral response in human beings that gives them the courage and compassion to  attempt  to defy statistics. Another interesting question S posed was about the presence of the soul. Forever the scientist, his point was that if the soul exists, as an independant entity, much like space, time, matter, then what is the quantification or measure of it and why isn't there any? Awareness, consciousness, sub-consciousness - is that all just neurons firing away? With time forever hurtling us towards one direction, maybe I'll never know for sure. Then again, maybe tommorow by the time I get to work, everything will be crystal clear!   &nbsp;

      Music is a beautiful thing. I put on my headphones and this cubby-hole seems to become much less oppressive.&nbsp; So, I'm reading this book "Mountains behind Mountains" and I wonder, how is it possible that while Dr. Farmer is busy saving the world, I am languishing here.&nbsp; Anyone have a good answer...hold on, let me check the Employee Manual. But complaint and blame are easy. Taking risks is hard.&nbsp; I am here because of my own choices, I need to not forget that. You know what the problem is? I know too many inspiring people&nbsp;and that it makes it hard to lead a mediocre life, thats what it is. I guess I'll have to compensate by thinking great thoughts! :-) About this book though - interesting how I got a hold of it. Met with Shariq Syed this weekend, and he thought I should read the book, so off he goes and buys it for me. A little "pay it forward" in action.&nbsp; Well, I'm going to mail the book to Anjali once I'm done (note to self), so hopefully it'll keep going.&nbsp; It's a biography of Dokte' Paul Farmer, his work in Haiti, and all in all, inspiring&nbsp;to a point where&nbsp;I didn't really get much sleep last night - I was so fired up. I was thinking about all that needs to be done in India, and how in the world I'm going to get to all of it at this snail pace of my life, not to mention my personal limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then of course, there is this whole spiritual pursuit. Yikes, the list is growing long, and the time is short.&nbsp; But then I meet people like Shariq Syed, and I think: "Things flow, and they fall in place, and haste and impatience is waste."&nbsp; How can I cultivate, all at once: patience, vigor, compassion, exactitude? Any ideas? One of these days I need to get a hold of a Sanskrit scholar and check whether&nbsp;some of those shlokas I've been listening to are in fact profound or what. Ratasmaramirudisansupradatmatatvam... sounds like an impenetrable mess, but I'm pretty sure I can discern the word "soul" in there. Progress! &nbsp;

      Hawking writes: "The Euclidean path integral over all topologicallytrivial metrics can be done by time slicing and so is unitary when analytically continued to the Lorentzian. On the other hand, the path integral over all topologically non-trivial metrics is asymptotically independent of the initial state. Thus the total path integral is unitary and information is not lost in the formation and evaporation of black holes. The way the information gets out seems to be that atrue event horizon never forms, just an apparent horizon."  My point exactly!

      Maybe blessings cannot be "given", maybe they can only be "released", maybe they flow naturally, in a choiceless manner so to speak, whenever one encounters things of profound inspiration and importance.  (Context : Nipuns wedding, and conversation with Viral about how we speak of being there "in spirit")

      A friend recently asked me "how does one know what to do?". She wants to know if she should become a teacher. I did think about teaching, before, although not too seriously, because it would be to the detriment of family priorities. But I think the larger question is an interesting one. What dictates the choices that we make? And are we "supposed" to make certain choices? I find that the subconscious always seems to know what to do. Examining the self carefuly in the context of the circumstances of the moment, one can find a beautiful directionality emerging, perhaps only a subtle hint of it, like the light push of a breeze on one’s back, encouraging one along a particular way. The challenge is tuning into that level of subtlety. A prerequisite for such tuning in is non-resistance to any outcome, because complete stillness, complete lack of mental noise allows the patterns to emerge with clarity. The paradox here is that non-resistance implies indifference to all directions, yet our very attempt to non-resist exists from a desire to find direction. Perhaps this is why, the sages concluded that even the desire for direction, for salvation, must dissolve before the final crystal clarity emerges. I suppose this could well be applied to somewhat shallower goals than nirvana! So what does all this mean? To me, it means that I’m trying to live my life in the moment. Not frivolously, as if the next moment doesn’t exist, but carefully, as if this moment was eternity itself, and the choices that I make of this moment are important. Of course I find this terribly difficult, but I am glad to have started…
