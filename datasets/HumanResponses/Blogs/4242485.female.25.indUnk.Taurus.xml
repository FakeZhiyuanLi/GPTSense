      Dearest Jane, If you could see me now, you'd see that I am tongueing the air in a circular motion, while producing a sound not unlike the "aah" that one is forced to produce when one's tongue is being smooshed by a tongue depressor. (Darling, rest assured that my tongue has never found itself depressed, as I make certain to keep it quite active in the community, as you may well know.) I am keen on presenting you with this kittenish image because, my dear, it is the only birthday gift I can presently afford. I am not trying to arouse you, no. You have made clear to us all on several occasions that you fancy older women and younger men. I am neither of those (though I have been known, on several occasions, to dress up as both). No, it is not your affections that I seek. It is your laughter. Not since the crisp autumn of '89 have I been so enchanted by a lady named Jane. And, Jane, my sweet girl, your laughter (especially when preceded by one of my witticisms) renders my heart a huge, bloody pile of ventricles and atria, which I then must scoop up and stuff back in my chest, which, in and of itself, is quite a task! Jane, what I am trying to say is, well.... ...you fucking rock. I googled you, and discovered that you are, in fact, a direct descendant of Sassy McSassypants (which I already suspected), and that your lips were, in fact, contoured to match the dimensions of the front bumper of the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle. (This, again, I suspected, but I had to be sure...) You are a star, sweet Jane, and I bow in your presence (if only to look up your skirt). I revel in your salty wit, and marvel at your abundant tit. (Did I get that backwards?) Miss Jane, girl, even your fucking farts are funny.  Happy Birthday, sweetness!  Love, Jaime

      Why that would have been entirely too obvious! Instead, I went for Thai. Just across the river from here lies Sea, an ill-named, palate-pleasing, hipster-frequented restaurant that taunts my stomach lining well before and haunts it long after I indulge in its spicy richness. Brooklyn had called on me for the first time in nearly two weeks. Today, its gastronomic sirens were singing promises of miso-coated greens with crunchy things, no less, and a thickly dressed mass of mild, and almost too-sweet pad thai. Uniformly guzzling coffee and water, I calculated each forkful not by mass, but by syntax, each bite a punctuation, which, despite noodley perfection, could never supersede your sticky-tongued, time-lapsing announcements that, like a lover's lissome half-touch, inflate my lungs with your breath. (And to think--you hadn't even rehearsed them!) I read Love today. Amid the scent of dirty fish-water that only slightly polluted my noodles, I laughed about toasted pearls and silently thanked the maitre d' for seating me next to the pond. How appropriate! I paid the bill in cash and would likely have floated out the door had I not just consumed such a load. As I turned the corner I noticed a pink liquid-filled bottle-type thing standing plumb on the top of a lamp-post. Satisfied by the strangeness of it, I walked on. I sat on one of two benches framing the door of a tiny cafe on Bedford Avenue. A pretty, plain, ponytailed girl sat on the opposite bench, reading a book much smaller and more practical than my own. I wondered whether I should open my book again. I lifted my eyes to the Avenue's tableau (of which I was merely a visitor), and silently studied faces with my fingertips. I did not open the book. I saw a man with a tattooed face. I delighted in his boldness and sighed with the notion that he was infinitely more certain of his art than I. He had made such efforts to disguise himself from one who could be swayed. He had not gotten an MBA 'just in case'. No, this tattooed-person, in all his complexity, had reduced his life into the simplest terms: he would make his way as an artist or he would amount to nothing at all. With countless vials of dark, syrupy ink, he had erased all possibility of failure. He looked like a monster. But when I closed my eyes and touched his face with my fingertips, I felt only warm, soft skin. I touched my own face. It felt greasy, unwashed. And then it happened! An explosion of laughter and whooping and 'oh my god' and 'oh my god' from inside the cafe. In my meditation I had inadvertently closed my ears to see more clearly, and now, this voice so violently plucked my cochlea, its vibrations shook my entire body with the harshness of a six a.m. alarm. Tattooed-man's head spun; a ponytail whipped 'round; I dropped my hands. All of us, in our voluntary solitude, were ripped from ourselves. Ponytail girl smiled sweetly (she understood all this) and I blushed. I stood up. I was certain that booming-voice man had won the lottery. I looped my purse-handle over my wrist and picked up the book. I poked my head into the cafe. Booming-voice man was still firing rounds of bliss in bullets, and like Eros himself, had shot me. I know why you're yelling, I said. You won the lottery, didn't you? Am I right? Nope, but I probably should buy a ticket today, he said in an accent flavored with some sort of African, some sort of British, and a good deal of American. He was a huge black man, bigger than his voice, bigger than the image I had had of him. He motioned towards a drawing that lay on the tiny table. There, immortalized in black marker-- looming, dominating, Herculean--was him, booming-voice man. His name, I discovered, was Quincy. At the other end of the table (if a laughably tiny table can be divided into ends), sat Alex, the artist. He had just revealed the street-hip quasi-portrait to Quincy, who had asked him to design a new company logo. Quincy was appropriately thrilled and made no attempt to conceal his fervor. The two men were pleased that I had interrupted them, and invited me to sit. I graciously obliged. Quincy was drinking fresh pineapple juice that looked like a banana milkshake. He had liked it better the day before, but slurped it down just the same. Alex fancied the tiny cafe for its decaffeinated iced coffee, which he had trouble finding anywhere else. For a half-hour, we chit-chatted about our various thisses and thats. Once, I exchanged waves with ponytail-girl through the window. Once more, I blushed, fingers buzzing. Alex and Quincy were both artists: Alex freelanced as a storyboard writer, actor, film producer, artist; Quincy worked as a music producer and actor. We exchanged numbers, which I both expected and welcomed as is always the case with industry folk, and when Quincy remarked that I was a duplicate Jaime in his contact list, I told him to write 'Jaime pineapple'. Instead, he wrote 'Jaime girl', which was fine too, but I questioned his whimsy. We all walked to the subway station, but only Alex and I boarded: Quincy had forgotten something at the cafe (hopefully not the picture!). I did not, at that moment, question his shrewdness. One transfer and a few minutes later, we arrived at Grand Central Station, and though I knew Lucy would ungraciously punish me for my frivolity with a purposeful 'accident', I agreed to attend an actor's showcase with Alex and his sister, who would meet us at the theater. It had slipped my mind that I had skipped a shower in haste this morning, until we sat, limbs touching, in the un-air conditioned tiny theater. In defiance, I made certain to pin my elbows down at all times, which concealed any evidence of my poor hygiene, but simultaneously worsened it. Self-conscious and sweaty, I was nevertheless enormously entertained (I would even venture to say, inspired) by the showcase. When the show was over, I joked about my uncleanliness, with the same intention as when I asked you to touch the mosquito bite on my butt- crack. It was clear that Alex wanted to buy me dinner, but I excused myself to go walk Lucy and, of course, shower. (I have yet to perform the latter task; I had not intended to write anything more than a simple email when first I sat down.) He went off with his sister, a charming girl, and I headed home. While waiting for the bus, I secretly listened to a young Chasid's phone conversation which involved some sort of greedy man's intentions for the other guy's sister and an expressed affinity for corned beef sandwiches. Standing on the opposite side of the bus-schedule pole, I decided I would wait to board the bus he was boarding so I could listen some more. He boarded the M2 and I followed, but halfway up the stairs, he turned around, glanced at me, and left. I felt so cheated. I wondered, did he know my intentions? It was quite simple, really. I had wished to study him, but I knew I could not touch his face with my fingertips. So I had closed my eyes to hear him better. I suppose he knew this. Lucy peed on the floor. Such a tiny puddle. I enjoy the process of trying to not miss you. I fear returning home to an empty mailbox, so I do what I can to stave it off until it's unlikely that you have not written. I found 8 today. My pearl.

      I. Saturnine Day  My attire for the day: a tweed fedora, a powder blue halter-top, and old gray Calvin Klein bikini briefs; I unabashedly admit that weekends’ empty windows often lead to waggery.  I tug the hat’s front rim down and to the right, which casts a crooked shadow across one eye and cheekbone.  I knot the vintage halter between my breasts and fold the CK band over twice, concealing its famous-maker status.  For kicks, I have placed an oversized pink canvas umbrella in the window to mock my own fading superstition (which used to terrify me in bounds).  Aching to engulf me in its satellite pull, eight points misfiring, a single polished wooden handle targets my signal, hooking me and wrenching words from my white-knuckled inner demon.  Over the quiet swishing and moaning of Saturday’s slick street, Vivaldi’s Winter Concerto rumbles a thematic exposition and pelts the berry canvas with hailstones of plucked bass and gales of shrill strings.  I adjust my fedora accordingly.   This morning, I awoke to a staccato peeping belch of a Mozart aria, signaling my mother’s intended invasion, and upon my answering, her imperial conquest of my fresh morning mind.  Fuck!  What time is it?  Good Shabbos,  she chided, mocking my quest to discover my Jewish identity.  Fuckin’ fuck, Mom!  I overslept for work!  (click.)  At 10:30 AM, I strode in with my 9 AM swagger, but Kelly greeted me within seconds with an invitation to leave.  I deserved it, so I didn’t fuss.  I grabbed a couple coffees and a half of a cheese danish and went to Lorien’s, where she and her friend Michelle were preparing for some outdoor festival on Randall’s Island.  Damn good vibe at her place, as always.  We walked over to get tofu-lox cream cheese and bagels (I passed) and mused about penises and the “plaster-caster” lady immortalized in the Kiss song.  We laughed the entire walk.  I danced around in the bagel place.  Today was cheap-vaccination day at Petco.  So I brought Roosy in to get another year’s supply of heartworm pills.  I waited in line for an hour before the flustered lady told me as she fidgeted with a stack of blue index cards that I hadn’t needed to wait in line, and she then ushered me over to a lonely desk where a guy and a manual credit card swiper sat and waited for paper and plastic money and signatures.  I was told to sign, and I clutched the pen against my calloused first-knuckle of my middle finger, prepared at once to scribble the cryptic gaggle of loops and slashes, my frivolously-constructed autograph, my tattoo, on the line.  But the bored man’s arm shot forward, his hand contorted around a pen, and he selfishly insisted on writing the date for me, upside-down no less, which gave him the most peculiar satisfaction, but at once caused my nostrils to flare in order to accommodate my forced patience-inducing inhale.  It was the 4s that fucking killed me.   After that, Roosy and I took turns being cute in Union Square for three hours.  And now, Summer has begun.  Thickly layered, dripping with sweat, it fans itself with flapping bent elbows and resin-slicked bows like windshield wipers, slicing the moist breath that otherwise lingers.  A breeze whistles away the storm in a final presto giggle of bouncing treble and I reach over to close my umbrella.   II. Wreck Loose.  I’ve just snorted two lines of Ritalin, lint, and dog fur through a pen cap.   I have been willfully and fully reduced to the form of a catatonic insect with a perturbing itch on the sole of my left foot.  I try to understand my own reasoning behind this ridiculous method of ingestion; I suppose the loss of my job today has erected my panic walls and conjured a sudden desire to hyper-focus it all to hell.   To make matters worse, the Indian paraders of Madison Avenue really screwed up my Sunday masturbation marathon and subsequent manifestation of my inner nerd, eternally invoked by one Will Shortz.  Several times already, I’ve had to guddle for my bedsheet to shield my nakedness from faux Indian princes and their flippy-floppy hands.   I’ve just lined up three and four, pen cap dangling from my mouth.  I wonder if that's irresponsible: my lingering saliva might catch some of the dust and prevent it from burning through my cilia and directly pummeling my brain.  I study it.  It passes inspection by a thread, moreover one of those curious newly-opened black plastic pen cap threads which you can’t help but tug at with your teeth.   Oh, what happened to the parade?  It floated away, I suppose.  Take me with you, jolly good Bollywood! Goddamnit—this dervish wishes to whirl!  (Perhaps the fact that I actually need Ritalin is fucking this whole thing up.)  I can’t get high.   Oh, but hail Visa Platinum—-you never cease to comfort me in times of need.  Today, I need.  You cut and slice like a Ginzu, and you have the lowest rates around.  Today, when I was fired, you became the newly appointed king of my domain.  You are now in charge, so charge away, charge card.  But first, I must lick your filthy edge clean of my sins.  I just scooped up some Ritalin with my pinky nail and sucked it up my nose.  I feel dangerous.  But not focused.  My bane has returned home to feed his excessive fucking television addiction and wasting-of-air predilection.  He assaults me with noise.  (God, I hate that squiggly green line that keeps underlining my shit on Word!  Hey you dad-blasted paperclip-man!  Stop pointing out my grammatical errors!  Freak.)   I put the childproving cap back on the bottle.

      I see you everywhere.  I remember the first time I walked past you on the street, my cheeks suddenly afire and my legs so unfairly impaired by erratic nerve impulses aimed at my sex, that I was at once too shy to speak to you. You were trying to drink your coffee as you walked, which seemed like quite a task, as measured by your syncopated, forced-legato stride. Though my presence went unnoticed, I was smitten with a desire for a hot bloodrush, and so, I went to where you had been, and purchased a coffee. Smiling, I flicked the cocoa canister on its belly to dust the placid surface of my cupful and softly fingered its grating holes as I watched the swirling powder float.  Once, in a spontaneous fit of girlish whimsy, I nearly jumped right into your lap when I spotted you on the bus! But then I noticed that you were preoccupied with smelling your fingers, the sight of which boiled my blood with jealousy; I was plagued with the image of your afternoon romp with a nameless girl whose velvety myrrh swirled through your fingers in a stretched web, and I wanted so badly to have been that girl. For a split-moment, I peered past the smelly-looking man next to you, and silently demanded your attention. But by this time, you had pressed your head to the cold glass window, having apparently absorbed quite enough of nameless-girl's scent for a time. The telepathically-inclined smelly-man had heard my thoughts for sure, because he then smarmily grazed my ass with a comic book (of all things!) as I made my way towards the back. Grumbling, I composed myself and sat five rows behind you, to escape the balmy scent of Ivory Soap that wafted through the front half of the bus. I smelled my own fingers. They smelled of grapefruit.

      "Uniformly guzzling coffee and water, I calculated each forkful not by mass, but by syntax, each bite a punctuation, which, despite noodley perfection, could never supersede your sticky-tongued, time-lapsing announcements that, like a lover's lissome half-touch, inflate my lungs with your breath.  (And to think--you hadn't even rehearsed them!)"  My mentor used to come over to my apartment late--later than the latest lady-who-lunches set down the latest Danielle Steele on the nightstand.  My roommate would be asleep (my mentor was a secret) and I would leave the door unlocked while I waited, quietly, pretending that my breath was not immobile in my chest, cocking my head as Lucy did, upon any semblance of activity in the hallway. Mostly, we'd stay in my room.  Once, we sat on my rooftop.  That was the first time he read to me in person, not like that time on the phone when I stood, gleefully soaked, in my own Times Square thunderstorm shelter, listening to him read the words of another.  As he read to me on the rooftop that night, I listened intently, rolling every word around in my own mouth like the very last tapioca in the pudding cup.  He read, and I, like an autistic child rocked, knees bent, hands clasped around them.  I closed my eyes; I opened them.  I forgot to breathe.  His mouth, his instrument, was losing its moistness with each passing word, and soon, those sounds that occluded and diverted became delayed in the stickiness of dehydration, and then, for the first time, he announced it: "section break".  The hum that accompanied his tongue's slide from the "n" to the "b" smacked like melted caramel stretching towards the final "k", whose abruptness severed the sweet glaze in an instant. Just then, I remembered to breathe.  We breathed a synchronous breath, as in a symphony, and my heart rearranged its beats to conduce to this halcyon trice. He did not know this. He told me later that he had spent the afternoon rehearsing how he would read to me.  After several similar sessions, I finally spoke of my infatuation with his dry-mouthed, deliberately patient announcements that enjoyed their own significance between two calmly timeless breaths, proclaiming that one section had ended, and another was about to begin. Delightfully shocked, he exclaimed that he had never included the break-announcements in any of his private rehearsals.  It hadn't occurred to him.
