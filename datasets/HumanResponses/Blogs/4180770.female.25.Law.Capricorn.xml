      Last week at work when we decided we would all go out for happy hour yesterday it sounded like fun.  Last night we went, and it was fun.  This morning everyone regrets it.  Some of us are hung over, and all of us are lethargic.  It's a good thing I don't have to do anything but sit here and look semi-busy.  The boy left last night at three after another round of bar hopping. I woke at 7:50 with ten minutes to make it to work.  The shower was running and the tub overflowing.  I do strange things when I'm drunk.  I got here, albeit ten minutes late. I forgot I had no car and had to hike to the bus stop.  My bus driver sounded like an amusement park ride operator, admonishing an invisible person to "Please Step Away From the Door," over and over.  It would have been comical if my head hadn't been pounding.   Searching for a hangover cure I found  urlLink hungover.net .  The best part of this rather comprehensive site?  You can turn down the brightness on the page if you're "feeling shady."  And my favorite cure comes from the "freaky" section: "a friend of mine said that drinking his wife's breast milk cured his hangovers when their baby was born. He tried cow milk after she stopped lactating, but said it didn't work like a woman's breastmilk. Creepy, eh?"

      I've been searching for pictures of her for my profile. My favorite is most obviously copywrited, and not saved as a .jpg file, so I couldn't use it anyway, but it's a fabulous  urlLink redention .   urlLink Here's  the history of the symbol from the curator of the United States Supreme Court.

      So, I just got a phone call at the law office where I work from a young woman who claimed to be being stalked by a large group of people. Individuals had been sneaking around her house and leaving threatening messages on her answering machine. This all culminated in a violent attack at a gas station parking lot and she seemed fearful for her life. She also claimed not to know the people or why they were after her.  Geez, I thought. We've got a paranoid schizophrenic on our hands. Then I read this:   urlLink http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20040809/ap_on_re_us/bodies_found&cid=519&amp;ncid=716   I know boys like their video games, but enough to brutally beat to death six people? If I were religious I'd fear Armageddon.
