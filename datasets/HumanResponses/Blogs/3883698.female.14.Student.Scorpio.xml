       Long long time ago  When I was young you were old  I used to believe in things magical  Used to believe in things mythical  So long ago those times have been  I wish you could see the things I’ve seen  And I have known far more than thou  But I’ve forgotten them this life around   Do I confuse you with my knowledge?  Of thousands of years gone by  I’ve gone down every road crossed every bridge  And still I live like I have more time   Immortality  Is a funny thing  A lifetime passes  And still I dream  Of being someone else  Not I  Flowing on the wind  Soaring through the sky  Amid all the laughter  Amid all the joy  Apart of the sorrow  In every girl or boy   Death is another level  Another goal to reach  Spend some time in heaven its  Just another fort to breach

       Jealousy is swelling in me    Cut my wrists    See&nbsp;my blood is green    My eyes are jade    Full of loathing and hate    Emerald is my skin  And my patience is wearing thin  Cracking my knuckles  Watching her and him  She's so pretty, he will win  And I will lose, left alone  Don't wanna lift  Make my own way home  Glance over my shoulder  He's at her feet  Hope when I am older  I will be more attractive

      False hopes False dreams Nothing is as it seems Don't believe Don't assume It will lead you to your doom

      Take my anger out  Let me scream and shout  Keeping all this in for ages now  I think its the monthly cycle somehow  Always gets me agitated  Pissed off, mad, infuriated  People say one little thing and I snap  I corner them so they are trapped  Shout and bitch and scream and yell  Tell them to fuck off and go to hell  If they annoy me more I get physical  I loose the plot and go totally mental  Its the music I listen to that helps me alone  The lyrics, the beats, the rythm, the whole song  The music makes me angry, the music makes me mad  Makes me do radical things, things that are only bad  I can hold my anger in for a long time  People bitch about me and that is fine  But one last straw and I rip, its true  You could be my best friend and I would rip at you  So watch your back and just beware  Check the shadows, I'll be lurking there

      Feeling down, deep underground Way below the surface, underneathe this town This judgemental place where people look the same With their sports clothes and heavy gold chains Beat people up for no reason at all Whether they be young, old, tough or small They have no rules, they treat others like shit Then they walk around thinking they're it Too cool for school, too good for others Giving everyone high fives and calling eachother 'brothers' Goths, greebos, skaters, they're not safe All the non-townies are too late Townies and trendies have invaded this world Taking over the minds of each boy and girl Aliens control their brains,  Making them all the same They refuse but should branch out to new things New music, new clothes, new looks, new dreams Every single one wants to be a celebrity And meet people like Lil Bow Wow or Britney Its almost sad, you almost feel pity But then someone comes up to you and acts really bitchy For no reason at all, all you did is glance At the stupid lable hanging out her panse Or the bulgy socks or the big sovereign Who wants a huge cirle as a ring? "Do you like the polka dots on my shoes?" "See that girl? I gave her that bruise!" Phones hanging from cloths around their necks Most wear braces and refuse to wear their specs Having sex before they grow hairs in weird places Fifteen tons of makeup on their faces Too many townies on this earth Destined to be idiots and losers from birth

      Seems to me we're meant to be You don't think the same though, evidently But we like the same things Dream the same dreams Like the same bands, same films, same clothes Same subjects, same people, same tv shows We laugh at the same jokes, at school we both moan And though I don't see you I'm sure we're the same at home One difference is, the worst of all You don't have feelings for me at all I love you truly I really do Every minute of every hour all I think of is you And yet you consider us as just mates And I'm accepting this is my final fate Friends forever, lovers never I can cope, but I will always hope You will change your closed mind When you are searching to find The love of your life Infront of you, your best friend, is your wife.

      There is a man beside the church wall, Unable to fight, he can barely crawl, There he stays, day and night, Too poor for food, too tired to fight, He has no clothes, he has no bed, Nothing to rest his weary head, he begs for money from passing people, His hopes as high as the church's steeple, But one one cold winters night he meets his defeat, And all that is left is a corpse on the street.

      I cant believe what's happened to you You used to be so friendly and happy! Then you met her, and now look whats happened to you Your a slut and oh so bitchy  Part of me wants to stay your friend Help you change back to the loving person you were But now, knowing helping you would never end I'll leave you with her  I hope you have a good life Dont end up with a baby at sixteen Find a nice man, be his loving wife He'll be a good king, you be a nice queen

      Don't confuse me Like when you use me Why did you choose me Out of all the girls  Is it because I'm not as pretty So you thought I'd be easy Or because I was shy and smiley And I'd be desperate for a boyfriend  I may look stupid but I'm not You think I have but I haven't forgot I hope one day you'll get shot And go through the pain I had to

      Don't be stupid, she said Your life is meaningless Get off the floor I don't feel pity, she said  Don't be pathetic, she said You're as bad as the rest I don't want you anymore I don't love you, she said  Don't waste my time, she said You can't sleep in my bed What use are you for I don't want to see you, she said  Don't ever come back, she said You're better off dead I regret having you even more You were a mistake, she said

      I listen into the darkness I can smell your fear I can feel your heartbeat I know you are here  How come your palms are sweaty How come you're wringing your hands How come you're going all ready How come your eyes are so bland  Why do you look around Why do you increase your pace Why do you not make a sound Why are you in such a state  Are you scared in this place Are you worried you're not alone Are you staying quiet just in case Are you rushing to get home  You think I never arrived You think that I did forget You think maybe I didn't survive You know I won't take revenge. Yet

      Cut off my blood circulation Make me feel levitation Being high is a great sensation Till you get locked in an institution  Big price to pay for smoking pot But have no money its all I’ve got Who cares if it’s making my lungs rot I’d die if I’d have to stop

      If only I could teach the sinners To be good folk again  If only I could preach to teens Not to loose their virginity And now matter how blue life would seem Everyone could turn to me  If only I could teach the world My beliefs and knowledge I know the world would be A better place for you and me Liveable and carefree If only…the world would listen to me  If I wiped out all religions So people all had the same faith There would be no more wars There would be no more death  If only all the sinners Would listen to my preaching They would be good folk again After some of my teaching   When thoughts of ending your life Races through your brain Simply talk to me And you’ll want to live again

      Life’s too short to worry, About the little things in life, Take time and try not to hurry, And avoid the hassle and strife.   It may seem like the world is against you, And the reasons for living become unclear,  But remember there are people who love you, And would miss you if you were not there.    When peace and love seem to fade, And death appears to be the only way out, This is when grief you need to evade, No matter how big the doubt.  Look around and you will see, There are people far worse off than you, Compared to their feelings you are so happy Even during times bluest of blue.   So the moral is simple and sadly true, There’s always someone with a worse life than you, So get to grips and face reality, Things will get better, wait and see.

      I’m not scared of water I just don’t want to drown I’m not scared of commitment I just don’t want to be put down  I’m not scared of flying Its just crashing worries me I’m not scared of heights I just don’t want to fall you see  Spiders are no harm at all Its just the way they creep and crawl I worry not by crocodiles For to find them I would have to travel miles  So with all my anxiousness gone I think I'll live my life and have fun And not fear the things I used to one little bit If its my time to go, I'll accept it

      That is so just like you, So unpredictable, I want you to know that, I think you’re despicable,  Don’t bother knocking,  On my front door Don’t wanna see your, Pathetic face no more.  You are shrouded, In secrets and lies, You live your sorry life, In hatred and disguise,  I don’t know what, Keeps you alive, But whatever it is, It’s making you strive,  I’m not your mother, And never will be, So don’t even bother, Come crawling back to me.
