      The definition of pain is disagreeable experiences. There are 2 types of pain..People pain and Situation pain.  In People pain, it start from broken relationship. It is categorize into 3 parts, which is rejection,discipline and loss.  -->Rejection You will feel pain when you have marital breakdown, because you will feel regret in some ways, and you need sometimes to recover from it,so you will feel pain. And u have a child, it will lead to parent and child problem,also will cause pain. it means the parent reject each other,the child will feel rejected. When the child grows up,the child will reject the parents, so there is pain. Another pain cause by rejection is general rejection for example non-communication. If there is a new person in your class, and he or she is left out as everyone in the class has their own good friends and group etc. So the person has no one to talk to and he or she will feel reject. So the person will feel pain. -->Discipline Discipline is taught at home and in the country. If a child is from a family is violent, and the child is always being cane or whatever for nothing, the child will feel there is no love in this world.So the person will feel pain. -->Loss You will feel pain in ways of separation and etc. When one of your love ones die or leave, you will feel pain because you are so close to that person that you don't want them to leave. If the person which die is not a Christian, you will feel more sad as they are not save, you cannot see them in heaven.  About Situation pain, it is categorize into 4 parts, displacement,improvishment,injury and old age.  -->Displacement If you lost something which you 'treasures' very much, you will be very sad and you will surely feel pain for cannot be able to find your things. -->Improvishment($) Improvishment means those who don't have enough or no money.And without money,they not be able to buy food etc. -->Injury You will definitely feel pain if you fall down or etc. -->Old age If you grow old, and when you are all alone, you will feel pain inside as you think no one cares for you. Or in the world, they will not care for the old people as they think old people is useless etc.  Ways to win over pain is to admit that you have pain, you can do nothing if you hide the pain. Remember the 'formula' which is "I WILL WIN OVER PAIN WITH PRAYER,PURPOSE AND PERSEVERANCE."  -->Prayer Prayer is the first thing in the formula. So next time if you are in pain, called to God. Removing the pain is God's first answer,so you will not feel pain. But if God did not answer the first time, maybe He wait you to wait, or He do not want to take away the pain first. So the second and third thing is purpose and perseverance. -->Purpose and Perseverance Purpose and Perseverance is the second answer from God. As it is written in II Corinthians 12:9,"My grace is sufficent for thee". Therefore, we must remember that what God has given us is enough. We also must sometimes let go the things which we think is the 'best' as God will give us something better than what we think is 'best' if we let go. So don't get angry with God if you experience pain and don give up hope, every pain has it own purpose. God's answer maybe ask you to wait, or he take it away or let it be there for a while.  So now or next time you is having pain, examine the pain and pray(prayer), discover the purpose of the pain(purpose)and keep on praying until the pain is gone.(perseverance)

      THE HUMAN BODY IS FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE By Rev Peter Chua  Scripture text: Psalm 139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  In his computer age, the most astonishing ‘computer’ in the world is still the human body. No wonder, the psalmist said, “ I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” Even today with modern science and technology, the secrets of the human body are still imperfectly understood. Fresh discoveries are constantly being made and new wonders revealed.  For thousands of years, people have tried to understand the brain. The ancient Greeks thought it was like a radiator to cool the blood. In this century, it has been compared to a switchboard, a computer, and a hologram – and no doubt, it will be likened to any number of machines yet to be invented. But none of these analogues is adequate, for the brain is unique in the universe and unlike anything men have ever made.  The human brain weighs about 1.5kg is the most complex physical structure in the universe. It is the central controlling organ of our nervous system. It controls, watches over, and coordinates nearly all the processes occurring in the body. It collects, evaluates and stores sensory impressions, and effects meaningful responses.   Our brain consists of around 100 billion nerve cells. These are as many as the number of stars in our milky way galaxy. The total length of the nerve fibres in the greater brain(cerebrum) is about 500, 000 km, with some scientists even estimate it to be as much as one million km.  Our ‘command centre’, the brain, would be useless if there were no links to the body. Outside of the brain, the total length of nerve fibres continually carry information and commands to and fro between the brain and all other parts of the body.  In some places, the thickness of the fibres is only one thousandth of a milimetre, but messages travel along them at a speed of about 40metres per second or 144 km/h. This is equal to the speed of a hurricane-force wind. (force12)  The optic nerve, the ‘information connection’ from the eye to the brain, is only 2mm thick, but contains more than one million optic nerves, all insulated from one another. Even in our modern age of optic glass fibre connections. Communications engineers can only dream of having a ‘cable’ with such high0tech capabilities.  We can normally distinguish between around 10, 000 varios smells, but even this remarkable ability can be greatly enhanced with practice, as in the case of professional wine and coffee tasters.  Your heart beats 10,000 times in a day, and pumps enough blood in your lifetime to fill a huge skyscraper. In every drop of blood, here are 250 million red blood cells; the number of these calls in all the blood in your body is an unimaginable 250,000,000,000,000!  This entire marvelous body is kept in operation by a small fist-sized pump, the heart which beats 100,000 times a day and transport nourishment throughout the entire body by means of 5 litres of blood. The volume of air passing through our lungs during the course of the day is 20000 litres. This provides the necessary oxygen, and the unwanted gases are exhaled at the same time.  Eyes in different creatures are designed to meet their differing needs. Humans need good resolution and detail, whereas a fly needs speed. We see a fluorescent lamp as flickering at 10 Hz (*cycles per second) but it looks stable to us at 20 Hz, so a normal movie would look like a slide show! This simple act of walking into a room and immediately recognizing all the objects in it requires more computing power than a dozen of the world’s top supercomputers put together.  We echo the words of Psalm 139:14, which David expressed his conviction that his entire being was fashioned by God. To clone a human being is to move from procreation to manufacture of human life. If human beings are special and truly sacred, then we must not do evil to bring about good. Human cloning will probably upset God’s creative work and we will be the ultimate losers for it.

      FACING DISCOURAGEMENT IN LIFE (By Preacher Ho Chee Lai) “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows” [Matthew 10:29-31]  Have you face discouragement lately?  For those of you who are studying, maybe you have studied hard but did not get the results you expected.  Instead, you may have failed some papers along the way.  Or, for those who are working, you may feel dejected that there seems to be reward in your career although you have worked very hard in your job.  Or you realized that your name is the next on the retrenchment list.  Or, for perhaps you have faced discouragement in your relationship with others.  Or it could be of any reasons, that this week, you faced discouragement that no one seems to understand.  The burden on your shoulders is too heavy for you to bear.  You felt like giving everything up, and wondered why life is such a discouragement.  Do not despair, my friends. Our Lord Jesus Christ must have felt totally discouraged too.  Imagine spending three to four years training up the twelve, and one of them betrayed Him.  Not only day, when Christ was put into the hands of the religious leaders, all the rest of the disciples fled from Him.  Can you understand the disappointment faced by our Lord?  Yet, our Lord knows how to face up to such severe situation.  He knew how to draw strength from the Lord.  In the garden of Gethsemane, He prayed for the strength to go through the most severe trials in His human body.  The Bible says, “And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him” (Luke 22:43).  Even as our Lord needs strengthening from an angel, more so for us that we may learn to find encouragement in the Lord for our discouragement. David knew this divine principle very well.  After all, who is more persecuted than him, under the hands of King Saul?  A major part of his life was fleeing from the hands of King Saul, who desired his death.  Because of that, David fled even into the parts of the territories of the enemies, the Philistine.  He and his men also had to humble themselves as subjects to Achish, one of the Philistine princes.  When called to fight against his own people, David and his men raided the Amalekites instead in the pretext of fighting against the Israelites.  When David and his men left Ziklag, their place of abode in the Philistine territories, to join the Philistine’s armies, the Amalekites took revenge and sacked the city and captured away all the women and children and burned the city with fire.  David and his men wept and mourned, until, as the Bible says, “until they had no more power to weep” (1Sam 30:4).  The Bible further stresses, “And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters” (1Sam 30:6).  What should David, the leader of the people do in such a discouraging situation?  He had not only lost his family to the enemies, but his loyal men wanted to stone him for their own losses too.  Only in such a dim and grave situation, the faith of the one who was called “a man after mine [God’s] own heart” shone brightest.  The Bible describes for us what David did, “but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God” (1Sam 30:6). How should you encourage yourself in the Lord in times of discouragement?  Firstly, understand that discouragement is part and parcel of our walk with God.  Nothing happens by chance but by the providence of God.  It is God’s loving care and grace that will be able to sustain us in our discouragement.  Does not the Lord promise, “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows” (Matt 10:29-31)?  If the Lord even bothers about the “cheap” sparrows, will He not be more concern for us in our situation?  Let us learn to uphold the promise that God cares for us as our encouragement. Secondly, learn to see the higher hand of God in your life.  The Bible say, “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose” (Rom 8:28).  We must know that God always has a higher purpose for us.  However, this in itself is not good enough.  We also need to learn to submit ourselves to the higher purpose of God.  Many Christians understand that God has a purpose for all things in accordance to Romans 8:28.  But what they lacked is a submission to this purpose of God.  They find no encouragement because they fail in surrendering their will in submission to the Almighty.  The patriarch Joseph understood this divine principle.  When he was betrayed and sold by his own brethren as a slave unto the Egyptians, he could see the higher purpose of God and learnt to submit to it.  He did not put the blame on his brethren.  Instead he testified, “But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive” (Gen 50:20)? Finally, learn to strengthen yourself with the presence of God.  Know that we are not alone as we walk the long and dusty road.  Although our friends are not with us, and nobody seems to understand or care, but be sure of this, God’s presence is constantly abiding with us.  He has promised to all those who loved Him, “Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness” (Isa 41:10).  God’s presence is the best present.  With Him, all things are possible.  My friends, be encouraged!  God is with us.  May the lyrics of this song uplift the hearts of those who are weary and who are discouraged: Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely? And long for heav’n and home? When Jesus is my portion, My constant Friend is He: His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. His eye is on the sparrow, And I know He watches me. I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free For His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
