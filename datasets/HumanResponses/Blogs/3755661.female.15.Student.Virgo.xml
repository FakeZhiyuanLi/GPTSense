      Well, I think the title explains it all. Really. Its really early in the morning. and I did not just get up. I'm still up.  I'm 15, an insomniac, a hopeless romantic, a loser who's friends are drifting away, and just plain old crazy.  Call me crazy. Wasn't that the title of a song or something? I think it was.  I like to write, and take pictures. And for some reason I'd like to be a psycologist when I do the whole career thing. Yeah. The crazy helping the crazy.  My favorite is "Insert favorite something here."

      I just spent all of last week at Crystal Lake Church Camp, and I think I can say with no objections of any sort by any person, that place is beautiful. Once I find my transfer cable I put up a pic of the lake and such.  It is truely one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen in my life.  Too bad I take it for granted so much eh? Today I won my first game of hearts while playing against the computer.  I really did, I only had 40 something points and I was the first place person!! Yaya!! thats cool to me, especially since I've been without a computer for the past week and a half. I feel very computer and internet deprived.  I still have to write my essay for honours english too.  Topic: Discuss the presence of Forbidden Love in the novels "The Scarlett Letter" and "Ethan Frome." both of which are good books. I think I'll probably be the only person in my english class that didn't hate reading "The Scarlett Letter".  I really like the book and was happy to read it. I began this post with many things set in my mind to write about, but they seem to have left, so if I remember I'll come back and put them up.    Farewell.  Brie

      I had a good laugh this week, it was a decent laugh that has lasted me from tuesday so far.  I'm still chuckling at it.  I was getting dressed on Tuesday morning and I had all my clean clothes in a heap on my top bunk (stupid bunk beds, I figured that I would have outgrown them by now, but I can't say I don't love them).  My normal school clothes are as follows: blue jeans and a t-shirt My normal summer clothes are as follows: blue jeans rolled up to the knee and a t-shirt with the sleeves and neck cut out. I have soooo much variety.  I love it. I find myself entirely and utterly amusing.  If that makes me egotistical then so be it, I could use a little self esteem.  I don't know what I would do if I didn't have myself to amuse me all of the time.  Don't get your knickers in a twist now, for fear not, I am not off my rocker.  It just gets lonely being an extrovert in a family of introverts.  They all like their 'alone time' (as do I at times) but I need at least some human contact during the day. I had another good laugh at myself this morning.  I dreamed that my mom was yelling "Brielan (what a cumbersome name, tis my full name though, pronounced bree-linn) get your butt out of bed!!"  What made it so funny was that she had left for work a couple hours before and I was sleeping.  It was at the exact moment that my mother at work said to herself "brie's dad is going to be pounding on the door and she's going to be sound asleep, I hope she wakes up."  I certainly thought it was my mom yelling at me (that is how she wakes me up in the mornings for school, I don't believe in alarm clocks. Though the case is really that I have yet to find one that will wake me up.) I was up and out of bed in an instant.  then I laughed because it was just a dream.  I wonder if they have Jones Soda all over the world.  It would be a shame if they didn't.  Fufu berry is my favourite flavor. I have a soft spot for the creme soda though, tis wonderful.  How could a person not love Jones Soda?  In the mornings when my dad comes in with my newspaper I just sit and drink my soda and read my politics.   Amazingly I have no political knowledge on the subject of politics even though I read dutifully about them everyday.  Maybe I've picked something up without even realizing it. All I know is that Bush is the first president since 1911 to actually visit the UP.  And he makes good jokes about Kerry and Edwards.  But then I'm always reading in my democratic newspaper about how wonderful Kerry is, then I pick up my republican newspaper and read about Bush's wonderfullness.  One of my favourite things in the world to do is to find the bias in the writing of others.   When I write essays for school I always trash humans, I don't do it intentionally, its just that you can use the faults of the human race to your advantage in just about anyway imaginable.  speaking of writing for school, I just finished my summer essay this afternoon.  I love the last sentence even though it makes no sense really. "A love forbidden is a love that shakes with its strength, tears with its pain, and escapes the world with lives in its grasp."  Isn't it lovely.  It always stinks writing essays in the summer though, because I haven't met the teacher properly and can't write directly to the teacher.  Thats a benefit of being in school.  You get to know your english teacher and can write exactly what they want to hear. I never mastered that with my honors 2 teacher though.  She just hated everything I wrote, even if it was good and she (albeit, grudgingly) had to give me an A.  I think she disliked me because I didn't respond the way she wanted to a question when I first met her.  She asked me: "If you could be anywhere right now instead of being here, where would you be?"  my response was "A deserted island." She scowled at me and said "Why?" so I said "Because I wouldn't have to deal with the ignorance of my classmates and teachers."  yeah I know it was rude, but I was a rude froshmen at the time.  She had just rueamed me for having a name that wasn't spelled phonetically and I was a little peeved at her. So I was rather quiet, actally silent, when we were introduced to the Honors 3 teacher. I don't want him to hate me. I was in his book club for a couple of weeks in the begining of my soph year, but had to quit because it was too much. I still have one of his books.  Okay, you know how when a car drives by the headlights make funny marks on the walls as they pass. Well theres one thats not moving on the porch.  so my brain says: Theres a car in your driveway that has its lights on. They're gonna come and try to rape you!! So I'm gonna go hide upstairs in my room.  I shouldn't be awake right now anyway.  Rent a foreign film.  Brie

      I want school to start again, no. I just miss school. It was like my one and only true companion. It was there when I needed it, it was there even when I didn't need it, and it will still be there in the fall when I endlessly return to it. Uhg.  Acutally I just really don't feel like writing my essay for honors summer reading right now, and I'm wasting time. I should be writing it. It needs to be postmarked by Thursday, so I figure that I'll whip it out tomorrow, have my mum edit it and then the mailman shall whisk it away. Ah the glories of the ever victorious mailman.   My dogs are uncool. Yes they are cute as your britches, but they are also as smart as monkeys.  They figured out that they can dig straight down and under the electric fence, and not get shocked. Seeing as half the fence was shorted out anyway becuase of mny families lack of interest in using the weed wacker, I'm suprised the dogs didn't figure it out sooner. They really are quite clever beasts. They have out smarted metal poles around the yard, 4 feet under the dirt, three feet of the poles visible (the poles were placed every six inches all the way around the yard. Those blasted dogs have out smarted the cement that we used to fill in the holes that they dug. They have out smarted the underground invisible shocker fence (of that I only have a vague I idea of how they conquered it.) And yet they have been the victor over the chains that we used to tie them up with. The dogs are just too smart. And they love it. Whereas other dogs love being walked and petted, our dogs love out smarting my family and I. Sure they love their walks, and they love being brushed and they love food, and they love attention, but those are all second to making us feel like stupid humans. So to solve our escaping dogs problem we put an electrified fence all around the yard. My brother and I were out repairing it last night and I grabbed it. what fun. There was no shock until I grounded myself with my other hand. Twas exciting indeed.  On Friday I start my summer job. Yeah, it is a little late to start a job for the summer, but hey, better Friday than never.  I shall be the canvas puller for the shakers. I'm willing to bet only .5% of the population of the USA even knows what that means.  My grandparents own a mongo cherry farm and run one of the biggest northern michigan cherry industries.  So lucky for me I get to work with them! Fun. But hey I already have my own bedroom there.  The Gramps decided to go about the cherry season with an old fashioned sense this year. Only family shall bring in the cherry harvest. Usually there are a bunch of migrant workers from mexico that come and do it, but this year the late frost and cold weather killed enough of the cherries that the family would manage it. So I, the unlucky (or lucky considering my situation of owing over two thousand dollars at the moment) granddaughter have been reeled into pulling the canvases under the trees while the big shaker machinery shakes all the cherries off on to the canvases. Delightful really.   I do enjoy cherries though, and maybe I'll work the apple season too, seeing as I need all the money that I can get. (Yes this awesomely huge farm also has apples.) I really prefer the apple season, because I love Macintosh apples, and ida reds, yummy. If you cut out the core of an Ida Red then fill it with brown sugar and nuke it in the microwave for a minute, you'll taste one of my favourite treats. It really is getting dreadfully late now, and I should be fast asleep. or slow asleep, whichever applies at the moment.  Buy a stranger a meal.  brie

      Well, I was going to sign on again last night, but the stupid blog wouldn't let me again.  So I left the rest of my thoughts for today.  I laughed last night when I noticed that I was eating out of an enormous vat of potato salad.  Okay, so it wasn't a "vat" persay, but it was a lot of potato salad.  I ate probably half of the bucket and then took it back downstairs.  A few minutes later I was burping and it smelled so bad that it was hilarious.  (If you haven't noticed, I laugh at myself a hell of a lot.) My cat even thought the burp smelled bad because she woke up and looked at me with her ears all flattened back on her head.  I burped again a few minutes later and I wouldn't be surprised if I woke the neighbors with my horrible giggles.  This was all last night mind you. Today I didn't get up till prolly 2 in the afternoon.  I opened my eyes and looked at the sky out my window.  My bed is perfectly level with the bottom of my window so all I have to do is roll over and I can look right down onto the street.  I looked at the sky and thought it looked about like it was 10 in the morning, then I analyzed how tired I felt and considered it to be about 11 am, then I considered the weather and how that would effect everything (It was all rainy and drizzly out, I positively love this weather), and I came up with the conclusion that it was about 10:30 am.  This was all before I looked at my watch and realized that it was 2 o clock.  I took the hottest shower of my life today.  I turned the water on as hot as it could go and just stood there trying to stay awake.  Oh! My fish died today, or last night, or whenever.  Lois died.  The stupid.  Clark, being the superhero that he is, is still alive and kicking, or flipping, or whatever fish do.  I figured that my cat, Linsey, is Lex Luthor in disguise and killed Clark's lover, Lois, in order to get to Clark, because Clark and Lex are the ultimate nemesises.  Then I laughed some more at the imagination that I have. I was very proud of myself the other day.  Kaitlin, Amanda (who is Kaitlin's 13 year old cousin), and I went downtown at prolly 10 pm, because we had nothing else to do and we were going to go find something to do.  (I was going to stand in front of the map at the clock tower and point at a spot with my eyes closed.)  Instead we made up this imaginary treasure hunt.  I was just picking random numbers and saying that we had to walk that  many steps in that direction.  Then we would look for imaginary clues that would tell us where we need to go next and such.  It was fun.  On our way back to the car we met other people in our grade (We actually saw people we knew during the treasure hunt too, I forgot to put that in.)  It was Kristin and Stephanie, they are the type of girls that worry about what they look like, and who they are going to have sex with next.  My dad says that my description of them is exaggerated, but I don't think so.  But seeing them while we were just ending our wonderful little imaginary treasure hunt made me realize how different Kaitlin and I are from other girls our age.  We just spent over and hour playing a game that most people stopped playing once they discovered puberty.  I was so happy that we maintained at least some level of innocence as we went through, and are going through, adolescence.  I hope I never lose that last little shard of innocence that lets me play games and be young. I was waiting for dad to take me home from Vicki's house last night and I was playing Indiana Jones in the backyard around the car.  I was pretending that the mummies and the zombies and the tomb raiders were going to get me.  I felt stupid, but I knew that nobody could see me, and just had fun for 5 minutes or so.  And I love singing the Indiana Jones theme song. Gotta love the George Lucas.  I just noticed that I am wearing one of my many Star Wars shirts while I hum the Indiana Jones theme song.  Sigh.  John Williams and George Lucas are a filmmaking match made in heaven. I drew a picture today.  It is of Tom Welling.  Once I find my tranfer cable for my digi camera I'll put it up. (the scanner was a no-go, damn thing)  I used a charcoal pencil. I haven't drawn with one of those in a forever.  But yeah. Has you ever read the book "The Westing Game"?  Its sort of a kids' book, but I was looking through my bookcase downstairs while my dad was hooking up the vcr  to tape the news (my aunt and uncle were gonna be on it showing the boats that they make.  Here's their website   urlLink http://www.vmgskiffs.com/   , you should seriously look at these boats.  They're beautiful. Its called the Swift Solo, a one man sail boat) anyway.  I was looking through my downstairs bookcase and I found a bunch of the books that I loved when I was younger so I brought them upstairs to put in one of my bookcases up here.  I have a lot of books.  I read an insane amount of books. no joke.  Anyway, if you ever want a quick fun read, I recommend "The Westing Game" by Ellen Raskin. Super good mystery type thing with a bunch of fun twists, and very clever. Speaking of books has anybody, by chance read "Grapes of Wrath" and want to tel l me about it? I can't seem to get through it. The skin on the insides of my wrists is all smooth and painful from me typing and sliding my hands across the lappy top as I type.  It hurts.  Not a nice feeling. I was playing my guitar earlier this evening.  I love my guitar.  It's so pretty. I'm always surprised at how popular it is too.  I'll be watching MTV and I'll see a guitar identical to mine in several of the bands.  Then I remember that my guitar is one of those super expensive ones that only professional musicians can afford. I'm not whizz at guitars but I know mine is one of the best.  Epiphone Les Paul Custom Flame Top.  I think those are all the words that describe it.  I'm sure you could buy a used one for $1400 on ebay. har har har.  Yeah, it is pretty much a waste for a totally not guitar player such as myself to own one.  What makes it even more ironic is the fact that I got it free, and my brother (who is a super amazing guitar player) had to pay a shit load of money for a non good guitar.  I got it for free because my dad did some networking for some company that had a partnership with Gibson, so my dad used the credit that the company gave him for doing a good job and got the guitar for me with it.  So I guess it wasn't quite free.  But anyway, I'm done basking in my spoiledness now. Have I ever mentioned that my parents think I'm spoiled?  I have only what the next kid has though.  Okay maybe not.  But I truely deserved the surround sound system for my bedroom...not.  I think my dad was trying to buy my love with it, and the guitar, and the snowmobile, and the atv, and the television, and the stereo system, and the dvd player, and the super amp for my guitar, and my car, and my super cool digi camera, and my own phone line, and my cell phone, andand my laptop, and my printer, and the nintendo 64 (that one was a few years back when they were still the latest thing), an pretty much just about anything I wanted.  Sorry about this whole last couple paragraphs.  I just think that everynow and then I need to appreciate what my dad has done.  Sometimes he and I don't get along. so I have to go back and look at all the stuff that he's wasted his money on for me. My mom doesn't believe in wasting her money though. So all this stuff is from dad.  They're divorced by the way.  Anyway.  I feel like a good kid again.  so I'm gonna end this for now, I might write more later.  Who knows.  Take a picture upside down.  Brie  Post script:  I'll put a picture of my guitar up just for fun.

      Okay, so my temper just fizzled out in like two seconds when I saw that it did in fact, publish the post.  I should really try to control my temper more, thats what my mom says.  Or at least thats what she used to say.  Considering that she doesn't say it anymore, I conclude that somewhere along the line I learned to contain my fury.  "Don't be angry at the world, because it has no problems with you."  I think that quote is just wonderful.  It's sarcastic, informative, inspiring, and funny all at once.  Too bad I can't remember who Hilary said said it.  Uhg, now I have two of the same word in a row and I'm too tired to reword the sentence so that predicament doesn't ensue.  bleh.  Brie

      Okay I couldn't resist, I had to put that song up as the title.  I know that it probably went out of style long long ago, but I really do love it.  and the music video is one of the best as well. They just don't make things like they used to.  Okay, so I can't even remember when that song came out, but thats beside the point.  Unfortunately I left the worst of all my summer reading books nearest to the end of my summer.  I worded that sentence funny because there is one other that I have to read but I haven't decided if I'm gonna read it or not.  I read it for fun during the school year, so I was hoping that my memory of the book would do me justice in the classroom.  Ugh, school starts on the 30th of this month.  And band camp starts on the 18th.  What really sucks is that I have to be in band camp on the day of my birthday.  (the 25th, I'll be 16 and well on my way to getting my drivers licsense [I lack the knowledge at this time in the morning to know how to spell that word]) I visited my grandma today in Grayling.  She is one of the littlest women that I know. I bet shes only 4 foot 7.  Really short.  Anyway...I forgot the point in saying that. I had a thought that was going to go along with that statement but I completely forgot it. While I was with my grams we dropped off my step-cousin's birthday card.  I must say (I haven't seen Justin in probably the better part of 2 years) that he has bloomed as a man.  He is my STEP cousin so I'm allowed to say that.  My grams thought it was funny that I was the same height as him.  Have I ever mentioned my height in one of these things before?  Eh...I'm about 5 foot 8 or 9.  So Justin is pretty short for a guy.  Hes a super good artist.  But then, if I do say so myself, I'm not bad.  I can take a pencil to paper and come out with something quite decent looking.  Once I get my scanner hooked up I'll scan some of my sketches and put em up here. I feel incredibly tired.  I'm neglecting grammer every other sentence and it is absolutely driving me nuts. I went with my dad and Vicki to look at a house today in Roscommon.  It was a beautiful house, and Vicki really wanted to buy it.  With Vicki's two kids and me and my dad and Vicki, of course, the house is just about the perfect size.  It's this enormous log cabin on 11 acres with state forest on three sides.  There is a huge barn for horses and the like, another smaller barn for wood and such, and an even smaller barn that would hold a boat and just basic storage.  I called the loft if they do buy it.  I think I got my commitment issues from my dad.  He thinks, even though he won't admit it outloud, that buying a house with Vicki means that he is completely tied into a relationship with her for the next 25 years.  Well yeah, buying a house is a big step and it would take a lot of commitment, but I don't think my dad can do it.  It's not that I don't have faith in him its just that I know the man, and he won't be able to part with $350000 easily.  It would be fun to live in the house though. Ahg, I have this enormous weight looming over me and threatening to crush my head.  Its called a math book.  I'm skipping a year of math, so I'm sort of going over the year I'm skipping during the summer so I'm not behind when I jump into precalc.  Well I'm supposed to be doing math over the summer.  I haven't done a thing yet.  and school starts in like 20 days.  I should really be flipping out right now and not worrying about my stupid blog thing. I was pretty unhappy with this thing earlier.  This stupid woulnd't let me sign on and kept telling me that my password was wrong and that it sent the password to me email and to check it and reset my password so I did all that, and then it asked me to sign in to change my password and I'm like "What the hell?" so I tried again and again and again and again. Yeah you get the picture.   Then my friend Kaitlin suggested that I restart my computer seeing as I've had it online for the past 3 or so days.   Yeah, Kaitlin the genius was right.  So I suppose that's good for anybody that reads this. I remember the point of me bringing up me visiting my grams.  She was telling me that the Princess Di beany babies were selling for a pretty penny on ebay.  I laughed when I remembered that I had one sitting on my desk next to my computer.  my cat likes head butting it. I got two goldfish on....Saturday.  I named them Lois and Clark, yes, they are named after the characters from superman.  Origonally I named them Louis and Clark after the adventurers that hung with Sacagaweah ( I have no idea how to spell her name) but then I kept saying Lois instead of Louis, so the name changed.  They're just a couple of goldfish in a nice shiny bowl.  I bet they think that they are tropical fish.  They hide on the bottom of the bowl like they are cold or something.  I thought they might be so I stuck my finger in the water, and sure enough it was pretty darn cold.  So I sat down at the computer and wondered why the water was so cold for a while.  Then I realized that my toes were freezing.  I mean, hello people, this is summer, its supposed to be 90 degrees right now.  But noooo, it has to be 40.  I suppose thats what I get for living in Michigan.  I love this state, its so perfect.  I love being cold too though, so I shan't complain anymore.  My bedroom window has been open for as long as I can remember so my room is pretty much whatever the temerature is outside.  My cat thinks its too cold too.  She likes burrowing under all the comforters on my bed and dripping her snot all over my blankets.  Its really gross. I had the most horrible dreams last night, and I couldn't wait for the morning to come.  I was dreaming that I was breathing toxins in the air and they were slowly killing me, and I wouldn't live to see the sun the next day.  When I woke up I realized it was because Corky, one of the dogs at Vicki's house, was sitting next to me and she got sprayed by a skunk the other day.  God she stinks.  It hurts my nose and makes my eyes watering whenever I'm around the dog.  Because of this same predicament I discovered that I completely lack any talent whatsoever at putting eyedrops in my left eye.  My eyes hurt so bad that I was loading up on eyedrops to make them better.  So I put some in my right eye successfully on my first try, then I tried my left and completely missed.  I tried again and missed again, after a few unsuccessfull tries and a few jabs in the eye I gave up and submitted to the tears of pain...from one eye.  What a sight.  One eye all red and puffy, and the other a pretty crystal grey. Well...I really ought to get to sleep seeing as I have to start getting back into the school routine here shortly.  Good night, and fare well until next time.  Brie

      I'm watching the Olympics!!! I love the olympics.  So cool. I especially love watching the men's soccer.  They run so fast and the field is so big that their legs look so funny, it makes me laugh everytime a man runs.  (That's a lot)  Their legs look so tiny and then the different colored shin guards running across the grass.  All the contrast in colors just makes it look even funnier. I was cheering for the Iraq soccer team when I saw them play.  Not because they are from a country that hates us and I'm looking down my nose at them, no. I was cheering because the wild card teams rarely do well.  So I was like "WHOOOOO" when they kept scoring. Thats so super. Yuck. my dad made me do some of the dishes today.  So gross. I hate it when I get to the bottom of the pile and they have all the grossness from the dishes on top of them on them.  Okay I know that was probably too much information.  Again I was eating more potato salad today,  because I love potato salad, and I burped again. It smelled so bad. Sooooooo bad.  Unbelievably believable bad. Japaners like hitting home-runs. Japaners still like hitting home-runs. Damn those Japaners.  They've hit like a bazillion home-runs.  Thats cool. I love the Office Depot commercial, I was just telling Kaitlin about it here:  Lank says: I love the office depot commercial out right now Lank says: mom walks in with a computer, daughter says "You bought me a computer? Thank you thank you thank you, you so totally rock!!!" Lank says: then dad walks in and says *sigh* "you bought her a computer? Lank says: " Lank says: then mom hands dad a reciept Lank says: dad says "Thank you thank you thank you you so totally rock!!" Lank says: daughter looks at dad with "whats your problem" look on her face Lank says: dad goes "WHOOOOO"  Its so funny. Last night I completely lost a game of Trivial Pursuit.  I felt so stupid. I never feel stupid, but I did last night.  If you look at my report cards, you'd think that I rock at trivial pursuit. Vicki's daughter Katie, who is 13, even beat me.  dad beat me, vicki beat me.  Oh well, I just didn't get the lucky questions like everybody else.  (i.e. What female boxer is the daughter of [I can't remember the exact words but they were along the lines of: the worlds best boxer]) and I'm like "No fair!!!" the sports question I got after that was "what late superbowl star's ring was found under a college student's couch recently?" [again, I have no talent for remembering exact words] and I'm like "What the hell!!".  It was Walter Peyton. My feet are cold.  I shall write more later, but for now, I shall just put this much up.  I still have my trip to the sand piles to write about!!  Take a picture upside-down.  Brie
