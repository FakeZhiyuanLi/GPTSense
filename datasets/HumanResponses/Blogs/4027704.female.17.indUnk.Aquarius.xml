      It's been a couple of days since i've updated... sorry about that.&nbsp; I've been really busy.&nbsp; Volleyball's finally over!&nbsp; Hopefully tryouts won't be too rough.&nbsp; In the end it doesn't even seem worth it to tryout.&nbsp; Even if I do make it, I know I'll never play.&nbsp; I don't want to be a quitter and quit my senior year, but I really don't want to play.&nbsp; I have no passion for it anymore.&nbsp; Summer league wasn't all that fun, my parents had to like force me to go cuz I never wanted to.&nbsp; Even when I was there I kept thinking, okay only 3 mores games and I can go home- i could have cared less about whether or not we won.&nbsp; It's just not me, I'm used to the competitive side, not the lazy one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh well, only a couple months and it'll all be over for good!&nbsp;   On a different note, I'm about to leave for Wisconsin!!! I'm so excited.&nbsp; We're going 'camping Naperville style'.&nbsp; Basically that means we have cabins and everything and electricity, but we're still out in the woods.&nbsp; There's so much fun stuff to do there according to Angel- a bunch of outdoorsy stuff- which is awesome! I checked the weather up online though and it's supposed to rain 3 of the 4 days :(&nbsp; Hopefully that won't be&nbsp;true.&nbsp; We leave at 10:30, so I have a little bit of time to waste.&nbsp; I'm getting so excited tho, this weekend is going to be so much fun!!!!!!!   Cya Sunday~   Melissa

      Well its about 2 o'clock.. I talked my familiy out of making me go to Iowa with them.&nbsp; I was pretty impressed they caved in.&nbsp; It figures that nobody is home the day that I can do whatever I want to.&nbsp; Everyone is either on vacation, or working, or just not home.&nbsp; It's crap.&nbsp; Anyways,&nbsp;this morning I woke up and came downstairs.&nbsp; There was a baby mouse sitting at the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp; I just assumed it was dead cuz it didn't move for like 2 hours.&nbsp; I didn't really feel like touching it and nobody's home so I figured&nbsp; I'd just leave it there until my parents could take care of it..... Yeah I just came back down and its gone.&nbsp; so basically I have a baby mouse running around my house right now.&nbsp; My cats keep taking off running and it creeps me out cuz I just assume they're chasing the mouse.&nbsp; grosssss.&nbsp; I'm thinking i'm going to go hit up the beach! More later.... Melissa :-*

       Well this is going to be my first entry!&nbsp; I've read people's blog's from time to time so I figured I might as well start my own.&nbsp; I just got off work a little bit ago..... very long night.&nbsp; I think like 20 people came in the whole night so I was so bored!&nbsp;  I guess I have to help my parents move my sister in to her new apartment in Iowa tomorrow.&nbsp; It's going to be one longggg day.&nbsp; I wish I could just stay home- but my parents don't trust me home alone! Figures right?  I don't really have all that much to say.&nbsp; I probably should go to bed soon considering I've got to be up at 5 tomorrow :(&nbsp; Hopefully this wasn't too boring of an entry.&nbsp; I really don't have much on my mind and I basically was home alone all day, so I have no great stories.&nbsp; Hopefully something exciting will happen tomorrow and I'll have something exciting for y'all to read!  Goodnight!!!     &nbsp;   P.S.&nbsp; Everyone should go out and buy the Kenny Chesney CD.... it's amazing!!!!&nbsp; Also, while you're out you might as well pick up the Ashlee Simpson one, because it's pretty quality too.     &nbsp;

      I am bored out of my mind!!!! My mom won't let me go out since I have been sick.  I can't go to volleyball practice because if I did I know I would get sick.  People can come visit me, but only a few have offered and even then its only for a few hours cuz they have plans for the night anyways.  It's just all so boring!!!!  Chris has come to visit me almost every night.  It's been a lot of fun.  His friends are giving him a hard time about it, so he probably won't be stopping by tonight even tho he told me he would.  Angel has stopped by a couple times to watch movies, but she has work tonight so that eliminates that.  Ben stopped by the other day after lifetime.  We had a really good talk.  It looks like things aren't going well with him and Chrissie :( poor kid.  They're having their 'talk' tonight sooooo yeah.  Pat told me he would come visit me but honestly, I know I'd just get bored because I have like no energy and really the only person I want to visit me right now is Chris.    I feel horrible about missing all of these volleyball practices.  It looks so bad.  Honestly tho, I would not be able to handle them.  It's not like I'm just ditching out.  I told Scarpino that I would be back on Monday.  I wanted to try going on Saturday but my mom doesn't like that idea so we agreed on Monday.  I just want to get back to volleyball, back to feeling well, back to going out and having fun and away from all this free time.  I swear I've watched more Olympics than anyone my age because it's basically all that I can do.  It gets boring! I want to go out, I want to feel fine!  School starts on Wednesday. blah. I have no idea what's going on for the first day either.  It's all up in the air.  I know Angel wants to get ready together, but I want to go with Katie and Brenna and them as well so we'll see.  As of Monday my life is pretty much gone.  I have volleyball everyday, probably work every day I don't have volleyball, and then school on the side.  Gross!!    I'm going to go watch some more Olympics. Yessssss

      These last few days have been very intense.  I've been very sick.  I woke up Thursday with a sore throat which my mom gave me some medicine for.  Then I went back to bed and woke up again throwing up and with a high fever.  My mom took me in to the doctor and they said it was probably strep, so I went home with that medicine. Then they called me a few hours later and told me that they think it might be mono or something else, so I had to go in to the hospital and have some throat tests done, and then they took some bloodwork for testing.  It was a really awful day.  I kept throwing up and my temperature reached 104.6, so my mom called the doctor in the night to see what to do.  They made me come in the next morning.  She put me on 2 more medicines, and she wanted me to take some chemo medicine where you stop throwing up so that I could hold my medicine down.  That medicine was really expensive tho so we skipped it.  Basically the last few days I've just been sitting at home, sleeping, watching the olympics, and drinking water lol.  My eyes are bright red.  I broke the blood vessels in them with my high fever, so they're all bloodshot... it's really attractive let me tell ya.    Angel came to visit me the second day.  She brought me a little baby dog beanie baby!  It's so cute.  She's such an awesome friend!!  Then Chris came to visit me yesterday.  We just chilled outside and talked :)  Hopefully he'll stop by again today!  I really like this one!  He's been really nice to me even tho he only met me once before I got sick. :D    Anyways my mom called Coach Scarpino since there's obviously no way I can try out.  She was actually really nice about it.  She told my mom that I'm already on the team so that I just need to come for pictures Thursday and then come back for practices whenever I am able to.  I guess that settles my doubts.  I really wasn't sure if I wanted to try out or even play, but I guess now my mom settled that one for me.  Oh well, no turning back now!  I guess it's not a bad thing.  It'll be fun!  Well time for another nap... lucky me!  <3 Meli

      I blew up at Sean yesterday.... I don't know if I should have, but I was just so mad at the time that it seemed okay to do.  Now I just don't know... I feel so alone.  I don't know why, I just do.  I just hate how the kid uses me like no other.  Not in the way you're all probably thinking.  Sean and I are best friends... well were is probably a better word to use.  But he one by one has tried to get on my friends.  I introduced him to Katie- hooked up with her, Dana- hooked up with her, Meg- went to prom with her, Laura- tried to hook up with her, and now Angel- trying to hook up with her.  It just pisses me off like no other.  It's pretty obvious to me that he just uses my connections to make friends (which is fine) but then to take over and start calling them instead of me.  I mean atleast stay a good friend to me, there's no need to replace me with every girl I introduce u to. grrrr.  It's just frustrating.   I hate this.    I don't even know what I should be doing right now.  It seems like everyone has gone their own separate ways, and nobody bothers to look back.  I think I live too much in the past.  It's funny to see how some people change.. how hypocritical everyone is.  But I think the biggest change that I've experienced the last few months is relationships.  People start getting married to someone and then everything changes, nothing is ever the same.  I don't want to end up like one of them.  I enjoy living the 'single life', but sometimes I see the couples together and I wonder what it's like.  I don't see how they can all just give up their old lives and friends, for one person.  I don't think I could do it.  Unfortunately, they all can, and therefore I'm left here without anyone.  I hate it.  I've watched too many good friends be taken over and too many friendships die because of it. This summer has been the perfect example.  Laura and I used to be best friends.  Her and Anthony started going out and I haven't heard from them since.  Then Angel and Stacey used to be best friends.  Stacey and Blake started going out and Angel hasn't heard from Stacey since.  Now Angel and I are best friends, and the other two are just going to have to deal with it.  But the funny thing is, Laura always commented on how she hated how Kristen let their friendship end because Kristen started dating Justin.  Well Laura, I guess you're the hypocrite now.  I guess that's just how life goes.  Volleyball's coming up, I really am thinking I won't tryout.  I just don't have a passion for it anymore, and it seems like a waste of time... that's just my opinion.    oh the decisions...

        Seth just called me!!!  He can't hang out until Monday.... bummer huh?    Tonight is the going away party for all the college boys :(  I'm going to miss them, especially Sean.  We are so tight!!! He's like my big brother, I love the kid.    Anyways, I gotta wait until Angel gets off work so that we can go together.  I just got back from work like half an hour ago.... I wasn't even supposed to work today but I covered a shift, and then they made me stay an extra 2 hours... grrrrrrr.  It's good for the money tho!    There's nothing all that exciting for me to write about.... Love you all!  -M-

      I just got off work a little bit ago and i'm home for the night.... Work was a lot of fun actually.  I worked with Mike and that's always a good time.   So last night my mom had another talk with me.  Apparently she thinks that I'm very sneaky and that I don't tell her anything.  I on the other hand feel like I tell her too much.  Anyways, she thinks I have low self esteem and that I always need to be the center of attention with guys.  Therefore, she wants to send me to a counselor for help.... right.... that will never happen.  I get so frustrated with her sometimes.  She doesn't trust me at all and she really has no reason not to.  If anything, her questioning me all the time just makes me want to go out there and do all the stuff she accuses me off.  If I'm already getting in trouble for it, I might as well do it.  I can kind of see her point with the guys, but honestly, lots of them are just friends.  Even if I do hook up with a guy, I have limits.  I won't do anything that would put me in danger or that could have a consequence.  I'm not an idiot.  She just doesn't seem to notice that.  I really hate it.   Volleyabll tryouts are coming up still.   Now i've passed the 'i dont want to tryout' stage and am worried about the running part.  It's rough.    Moving on.... the Wisconsin boys called Angel tonight to talk to us.  I was really happy that they called cuz I totally want to see them again, but I was kind of hurt that they called Angel.  We had called them from my phone a couple days ago and left my number, and yet they called back A.  I figured Seth would call me first considering he kissed me and stuff, i don't know.  I just feel like they liked her better, but A told me it's probably just that A is before M in the phone book and they just got to her number first.  It hurts either way.  Maybe my mom is right, maybe I do need to be the center of attention for guys.  This is different tho, Seth and I connected on the trip.  I thought he liked me.  I know he has a gf, but I thought that he still liked me, I mean why wouldn't i think that.  Oh well, here I go stressing over the non-important things again.  Hopefully we can hang out tomorrow and it'll be a good time.  I'd really enjoy that!   I honestly am just so emotional right now I dont' even know what to think.  I'm hurt that they called her, hurt that my mom doesn't trust me, hurt that my Dad was mean to me today so therefore I was mean back to him, anxious to see how tomorrow turns out, nervous to see the boys, hopeful that they'll actually come, jealous of many people, worried about vball...... i am just not in good shape tonight.  I'm at the point that I just dont' know what I want.  I'm just confused.  That should be my hint to go to bed, but I'll probably be up a couple more hours.    Anyways, goodngiht everyone!   much love     -M-

      We're back!!! We got back last night at like 7. The trip was amazing!!!! Angel and I met these guys who live like 45 minutes away. Their names were Mike, Seth, Pat and Ray. They're all 18 and we had so much fun!! I have the biggest crush on Seth. He was the sweetest guy that I think I have ever met! He would carry our stuff for us, and help us down the hills and go buy us drinks and I donno just everything the perfect guy would do! I miss him already and it's only been a day! Ang and I cried when they left lol. Angel had the biggest crush on Mike- he was really hot, but he was an asshole. I felt bad for her! It's okay tho cuz we still had the other 3. Ray was just a cutie. I don't even know how to describe him, he was just funny! I wouldn't change one thing about the trip, it was just amazing. We went canoing, hottubing, ceramics, late night hikes, played poker, played on the slide in the rain, made pies, smores, stayed up till like 3 at the campfire talking, rode bikes, played football, went to an island... everything!!! I'm going to miss it so much. Seth and I kissed too- it was so cute! We were at the campfire on our last night there, and we just kept looking at the stars and pointing out stuff, then when Angel left he leaned over and we just looked at each other for awhile then he kissed me! We exchanged numbers and stuff so hopefully he'll call soon and we can meet up! Angel and I became so much closer after the trip too. I love that girl lol.  Anyways, I came home just to find out that Jack now likes Allie again. I guess it's no big deal, it just kind of hurt. He had made a big deal of finding out if I liked him cuz he liked me and stuff. At first I didnt, but after the trip I had decided that I might give it a shot..... well that's not going to happen, cuz he changed his mind. I hate guys. They're all such assholes (except seth! lol). I think I'm going to listen to my mom and just take a break from guys for a bit. I am always with someone and it never works out. It's just not worth it anymore, I guess I'm not the type of girl that guys date! Oh well!  I have to go to work again at 5.... hopefully they dont' stick me in the dining room again... i'd be pissed.  It's good to be home :)  Melissa
