      So all in all the family vacation was fun.  I have to admit though, not as fun as I'd hoped.  Today was great. Christian came over EARLY and we just did nothing. Panera for lunch, then I had to work at 4.  UGGGHH. I hate work but it doesn't do me any good to bitch about it because I'll never actually get up enough guts to do anything about it. So...  Tonight after work I went to CM's and he gave me a 6 months anniversary present. It's gorgeous. Too gorgeous almost. I can't believe he actually gave it to me. It's a ring and I love it.  I love that no matter what my day is like, or night for that matter (as was the case with work tonight) if I end it by spending time with CM, all that other stuff doesn't seem to matter anymore.  You think that's what they call love?!? =)  Tomorrow is going to be pretty blah!  I have GOT to do laundry and Christian said he'd come over and hang out with me while I did it.  I was thinking about it tonight at work. A year ago this exact same time, the exact DAY to be exact, Austin broke up with me. And I thought that my entire world was ending. And in only a year, I've completely gotten over him, and completely changed the way I think about things...myself for one. It's just strange how we get so used to the way one person makes us feel (or think) and then when it's all said and done and we're forced to think (and feel) for ourselves, it's really nothing like who we were when we were with the other person.  I think thats probably the greatest thing about CM. He doesn't make me feel like I have to think the way he does, or act the way he does, or do the things he does. I can just be me, the person that thinks and feels for myself, and he loves me anyways.  That is a great note to end on.  Till next time...  *whitney*

      All that damn worrying I did last night about Christian was for nothing.  I was going to hang out with Mel today so I got up around 11 to take a shower and be ready by noon so me and Mel could hook up and go shopping.  Well, I since I didn't answer Christian's call last night, I figured I'd call him, see where he was, if he'd even answer.  WELLLLL...if you can believe it, he did answer.  He said he was on his way home from Jorge's (which I was very impressed by--staying the night because he was too drunk to drive home. Most of the time he'll just drive anyways which scares me to death...) and that he was just about to call me. He said he was going to go home and see what his mom needed him to do, and then if she wasnt there or whatever he would come and hang out with me and Mel.  Well, he ended up coming over and Mel called about 1230 and said that we (Me, Christian, her and Mark (her BF)) should all go to lunch. So we went to Chilli's.  Yes AGAIN. I just went there last night and then like not even 12 hours later, I went again. UGH!   It was kinda fun I guess. But Mark doesn't really talk that much, and so me and Mel try to keep conversation flowing. But I do have to give Christian some credit, he talks A LOT more than Mark.  Then we went to the mall, and then me and Christian took Mel and Mark home.  Me and Christian went back to my house and just hung out here for a few hours. We went to Barnes and Nobel cause I wanted to get some books, and then we went to his house and just hung out until mid night when I had to be home.  Which is where I am now.  Tomorrow morning Christian has an interview with FBISD for some afterschool program, and then he's gonna go have breakfast with me before I have to leave for vacation.  I'm not really looking forward to it as much as I was before because tonight my mom acted like a big bitch. Like for the gayest reasons she was getting all pissed at me. She made these chocolate chip cookies for the vacation, and just told me I could have some but that I couldn't have very many. Like one or two.  Well, I'll admit, I had more than one or two. And then today I was upstairs with Christian and I had a bad craving for one. So I went down to the pantry and opened up the container they were in and I remember thinking (seriously--I swear to God I thought this) that someone had been eating them, cause like they were almost all gone.  So I just figured it was my mom and she'd just given up on trying to save them.  So I had like 2 and then went back upstairs. Well then my mom came home and started getting ready for the vacation and she went to pack the cookies and she started SCREAMING at me about how I don't respect her and blah blah.  It was so lame. They were fucking cookies!!  And then if that wasn't enough. She calls me while I'm over at CM's (we left cause I had to get away from her!!) and she starts yelling at me again about the damn cookies. She's like "I'm so pissed that I'm not going to give you any more money from now on. You can't fuck with me Whitney. That's it. I'm not gonna let you treat me like shit anymore."  PSYCHO BITCH!!!  So yeah that was just stupid and lame and it just pissed me off at her even more. Like I really hope its that time of the month for her so that way she atleast has some kind of excuse for getting that upset over some damn cookies.  SO needless to say I dont wanna have to be cooped up with her all weekend. I plan on just taking my new book and keeping to myself. She can go and be gay by herself...if thats even possible..=)  Well it looks like I better be getting to bed now. Tomorrow I have to be ready for the adventure that is breakfact with CM. But I wont be able to update until after I get back from the vacation. But I will when I get home.  Until then....  *whitney*

      Yeah I know, it's kinda like human nature for girls to be bitchy to eachother. But at some point, you go TOO FAR.  Like with all the happenings of this week.  I can really understand Emily being mad because she THOUGHT I was talking crap about her, but then I can't understand why on earth she would go say the stuff she said, even if I HAD been talking about her. Which I wasn't.  Yes yes yes, it was my fault for telling her and Christy, and I know it was wrong. But I can honestly say that I the only reason that I told them was because I never, in a million and one years, thought that it would leave Emily's kitchen.  Which just sucks now because I know I can't trust anyone.   Atleast anyone that gets drunk and then talks about stuff they shouldn't be.  UGH!  And this whole summer I have been constantly dealing with the whole "I know that what Christian is doing isn't right, but I really love him and so I'll over look it." And its kinda to the point now where I dont think about it as much.  But you know what the funny thing is? Christian is so much more funny, so much sweeter, and more attractive, and more sexy to me when he's completely sober. And when he calls me at God knows what time of night, and he's drunk hanging out with his friends, well good for him. But I don't have to pretend that I like talking to him like that.  Cause I don't.  And as much as it kills me to say it, I'm getting so tired of it.  It's like ALL him and his friends do. Like when do they ever get together and just hang out and not get drunk? NEVER!   Maybe I'm the werido who can hang out with my friends and not have to be drinking (or smoking weed for that matter) and still have fun. But it seems to me that most of the drama associated with mine and Christian's relationship revolves around whom he was getting drunk with and what happened while they were drunk.  As was the case with him and jackie when he cheated on me.  As was the case when Emily told jackie all that stuff she shouldn't have.  UGH! Maybe I'm like the odd ball. Cause when i get drunk, I never start drama. Its always about having fun and hanging out. Never about talking shit about people, or making out with random people...  Whatever.   Tomorrow, me and Melanie are going shopping (thank God for finally getting paid), and then I have to pack and what-not for the family vacation.  Oddly enough I'm kidna excited.  For one thing it'll be kinda cool to see everyone again. Two Nick will be there, WITHOUT Kristina which, these days, is pretty amazing. Three we havn't had a vacation in over a year.  So it should prove to be fun.  Today was pretty boring. I got up (finally) at like 1 and Christian came over and then at like 3 we went to lunch. I had to be at work at 5 and then after work (like 1045) me and Theo and Christy and Sam went to Chilli's and then to Walmart.  OK WEIRD.  In wal-mart, me and christy are walking to the bathroom and she goes "Hey whit isn't that Danny V. from work?" and I'm like NO WAY and so we walk over all non-chalant pretending to go to the "bathroom" and walk right by him. AND IT'S HIM.   This wouldn't be that weird if him and Christian weren't like all close and stuff.   Anyways, so 1. I see one of Christian's friends.  Then we're walking to the restroom for real this time, and I do a double take cause I thought (might not have bene though I was pretty sure) I saw Christian's brother's wife. WERID!!!!!  THEN (OH THERE'S MORE) Me and Theo and Christy are over in the CD's and we're walking down the middle isle and I look over and walking out of one of the side isles is CHRISTIANS MOM!!  AHHHH!!!!  It was like they were all out to get me. hahaha!!  So yeah that was weird.  I was kinda angry tonight cause Christian said that me and him were gonna hang out after i got done at work, and then at like 8 he called Old Navy and told me that his friend marc was leaving to go back to school (naval Academy) on Saturday so his friend Jorge was having a party for him at his house. So Christian went there.  Which in reality was fine cause I know that he could see me any day of the week and Marc is leaving so it made sense for him to hang out with them.  I dunno, i was just being stupid.  Anyways so I was kinda mad and so i didn't call him when i got outa work and then he called me at like midnight and the radio in my car was up too loud and i didnt hear it. So when i got home i called him back and he was over at the partay with his friends. He sounded drunk (typical) and it just annoyed me.  So he was being gay talking about how they were all gonna call Jackie and make her feel bad and stuff. Whatever. It was kinda stupid cause he was just drunk-talking. Lame.  He said he call me back, which was fine casue anything that he was saying to me at this point was just bullshit and in-sincere. And I didnt really feel like dealing with it. Or listening to it for that matter.  Well, he just called me and I didn't answer. I don't wanna listen to him say stupid stuff like "Baby I love you.", "Baby I miss you so much.", "baby I wish I was with you right now.". It's all just so lame when he says it when he's drunk. cause it's not even like he's saying it cause he means it. He's saying it because he's drunk.   UGH.  Why can't I just have a normal relationship where I don't have to worry about anything?  But I guess I dont really want that because....well I dont know why exactly.  Well I guess I'm gonna go to sleep now. But tomorrow should be fun.   I'll keep you posted.  *whitney*

      Today was such a great day. Actually all weekend (starting with Thrusday night) has been amazing.  Thursday night me and Mel and CM and Craig partied over at Mel's house. Her parents were outa town.  Friday CM came over to my house all day until I had to go to work at 5. UGHHHH! WORK!! I hate it there. After work CM came back over and we just hung around my house for a while. I was pretty exhausted from work so he went home at like 12:30.  Saturday morning I went to CM's for breakfast, then he went to see Spiderman II with me and Nick and Kristina and my parents. Then we went to the Astro's game. WE WON!! Hell yes. It was all about Biggio. Yeah freaking right. I think I'm gonna have to start dealing with the fact that Biggio isn't so great anymore...*sniff*  After the Astro's game I went to CM's with him and we just hung out.  Today was the 4th of JULY!! My favorite holiday!! I woke up LLLLAAAATTTTEEE. It felt so good to sleep late. My cell phone woke me up. It was Austin and he was just calling to see what I was going to be doing for the fourth. LOOOOSSSSEEERRRR!!!!  CM came over at 2, we went to the store to buy some stuff for him mom. Then we went and had BBQ at his house with his family and then back to my house to eat with mine. UUGGHH!! SOOO FULLL. It's like Thanksgiving all over again. HAHAH! =)  After dinner we went to CM's and bummed, then we went to watch fireworks on top of the Marriott. It was so cool cause you could see fireworks from every single direction. Like every single place in Houston that had fireworks, you could see 'em from up there. It was perfect. Then me and CM came back over here and at mid night he left to go party at Jorge's.  Mel called me today and was mad becasue she said that her dad found a beer can in the fridge from when we partied over there. She made up some story about me and christian bringing them over. Her dad was pissed though.   Whenever me and CM and Mel and Craig were hanging out on thrusday it was pretty cool. Craig isn't so bad. I just dislike the things him and CM do when they are together.   Tomorrow I'm going to sleep late again and then I think I may go up to marshall's and look for some more shorts cause right now I have like 2 pair that I wear. PLUS: Our dryer is broken so I can't wash clothes. Whatever.  Tomorrow I'm on call at work from 5-close. I hope they don;'t use it, but I know they will. Jennifer works tomorrow night until close though, so even if I have to go in it won't be so bad.  Today, me and CM went over to Michael's cause he was having people over for the 4th and Christy was there and she brought Emily. When me and CM walked in we didnt even look at Emily and then as we were leaving, I was like "Bye Mike, Bye Christy." really loud, and didn't say shit to Emily. HAHAH!! Crazy bitch. I hate her so much. All I wanted her to do was acknowledge that what she did was wrong, and apologize. But hell no, she can't even do that.  WHAT-EVER! As we were leaving (me and CM) I got out and poured a diet coke into her gas tank. It was kinda like a spur of the moment thing that we were joking about doing and I didn't think I was really gonna do. It was very liberating though. OOOHHH WELLL! I hope her car breaks. Is that so awful?  I actually wish that I could do worse things to other people, but I wont even get into that anymore. It's over right? I just gotta keep telling myself that. It's over. It's over. It's over.  WELL Ladies and Gents, I'm heading to bed. I'll write more regularly I think from now on. Sweet dreams.  HUTH...OUT. hahahahaha  =)  *whit*

      Today is the first day in July. That means that there is just a little over a month until school starts.  I don't like that one bit.  I didn't write yesterday cause nothing really happened. I spent all day with CM and then came home and read last night.  I started this new book called "The Secert Life of Bees". It's really good.  Cm called me last night and said he was going to Craig's and they were just gonna hang out over at Craig's house. So I told him to call me when he was on his way home.  I fell asleep about 1:45 and then at like 3:45 my cell phone rang and it was Christian.  He said that he was so pissed cause he went to Razoo's (after he told me he wasn't going to go there. He said he went to meet Craig...not sure if I believe that or not.)and Jackie was there and then they left Razoo's and went to some bar and then CM and Craig went back to Craigs and this guy named Ivan (HAHA-Like in Theatre I, Ivan the great!)wanted to start a fight with Christian cause Jackie told Ivan that CM was talking shit about him. Whatever.  Turns out that Jackie told this guy that Christian was talking mess when in reality Christian didn't say anything and he thought that him and this Ivan guy were cool. But then they almost got into a fight and then CM found out it was Jackie talking mess and so they let it go and Christian went to confront Jackie and she ran inside her house so that they couldn't talk.  UUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH. It's all so much fucking drama. I hate it. It's the stupidest thing ever. I just want her to go away and ruin someone else's life for a little while. Christian says that he's not going to be her friend anymore, but I find that very hard to believe. Everytime something like this happens, he always says "I'm done with her. She's a psycho bitch...blah blah." But then he always ends up being friends with her again.  Like the other night, I got home from vacation and I went over to his house. Well while I was there, jackie called him. And as far as I knew, he wasn't talking to jackie. Turns out that he hung out with her and Craig while I was gone on vacation. And he didn't tell me because, as he said, he was affraid I was going to get mad. THATS SUCH BULLSHIT. Did he think it was a better idea for me to find out this way than for him to just tell me in the first place. GOD! Its like nothing that involves Jackie is ever easy, or completely without alternative motives.   It just sucks thats all. And I'm getting so tired of it. ITS OLD!  Whatever. Well, Christian is supposed to be here any minute (I actually exapected him long before now) but I guess I will let you go.  I'll try my hardest to write tonight if anything worth write about happens.  *whitney*
