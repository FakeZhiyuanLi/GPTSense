      june 19, 2004 2:19pm   Current Mood:  frustrated, stressed  have you ever been mad at someone that you don't want to be mad at? i hate being angry with the ones i love. it's something i can't help and it annoys me more than anything. my mood swings... the smarter part of me always goes "kara, quit that. you know you love them. no reason to be angry" and then the angry part of me is like "cut off all ties! you don't need this shit! this is what you've trained yourself to do!" -_-  *slaps self* maybe it'll finally all end when i get finished with this move. i'll be able to blow off some steam later this afternoon when we go horseback riding... it's been so long. i need to have an equine underneath me again, it's like, the only place that seems right for me. when i'm riding, or when i'm with horses, the puzzle seems to finally fit and everything else vanishes. god, i've needed this for so long.

      june 19, 2004 10:02am   Current Mood:  errgh... *has just woken up*  *stumbles over things* pfft. that was strange. did i write a song last night to piano and guitar? yeah... yeah... and it was called "one last time". my, was it pretty. how did it go again...?   the time has come for me to go to take another dreamy road i won't forget the things you told me  childhood's such a happy thing but lonely birds won't always sing let's play a game of hide and seek  one last time one last time (a lullaby for you and me) this is a bridge i thought i'd never cross (please stay a minute more for me)   and i guess that's as far as i got... i s'pose i wrote it for nayeli and denise. yeah. i'm gonna miss them. but we're definately keeping in touch and all... visiting several times a year... i'm going to have a job so i'll be able to afford a plane ticket, yadda yadda. anyway i'll continue writing "one last time" later on. so weird... it must've been REALLY late last night... oh that'd be cool if i actually dreamed it all. yaaaa.  what a great way to get your feelings across. writing songs is a way for me to vent as well as tell a story or emotion, it's perfect... whenever i'm bored or upset i sit down to write a song which both helps me, and sometimes produces a very pretty song. if i manage to land myself in a band in colorado, i'll show some of these to them, see if they like it.  andy told me that i shouldn't drastically change myself... i agree with him. as always. he said that sometimes, changing your outer appearance can sometimes... i don't know... cause you to either change your inside or at least want to make you mask it. i like who i am, and i don't plan on changing into some kind of sinister moody person... i just really need a new look ^-^ i'd also like to take a step back and look things over... perhaps, if i change at all, to become more of a listener than a talker. anywho i luv you andy... if there's anyone out there who can accept who i am, it's basically eve, nayeli, or you. i'm glad to have ya'll around. you only need a few good friends, and i'm glad i've got some.  *looks at calendar* four more months until winter. four more months until snowboarding...!

      june 18, 2004 11:30pm   Current Mood:  Helpful, dark, curious  i can't seem to find an alternative rock band that's quite like evanescence... and evanescence is cool and all, but so overrated nowadays. i mean, even my mormon friend stacie likes them. i looked up nightwish, which i'll try and find some music clips of because i really like their lyrics, it tells a story. mushroomhead i found a little bit scary. seether was totally and completly depressing ("kill me. kill me. kill me."). gah! i'll continue looking. can't wait to get my OWN band started.  so i'm still here listening to my beloved evanescence cd. i suppose i'll have to continue being content with them. i was lookin' at some clothes off hot topic... my my, how i wish i could get my paws on those. i will, someday.  itch itch... it's an itch i'll never be able to scratch as long as i live here, i reckon. i'm talking about family. sheesh... it's like, either my sister or my mom is always here with their sticks up their asses, bothering me to do this or do that. of course my harry potter addict sister always wants to get online to fill her brain with the oh-so-exciting fanfictions about how this teenage wizard continues to out-wit and out-perform everybody. it never ends. and today, my loving mother came and sat her fat ass down on the couch, literally pried the remote control from my hands, and switched the channel to her pathetic soap-opera movie channels. and then, she took my apple. itch itch. itch. i hate her. i had some pretty dark thoughts about her in my book of shadows... looking back on the entry, it sort of scares me. it's like it wasn't me that wrote those curses on those sheets of paper. it was an alter-me, my darker side that i usually keep under the covers.  today i used some dark eyeshadow around my eyelids, and below my bottom lashes. it was quite pretty. my dad was like "what's with the heavy make-up?" though it wasn't really heavy... i didn't think so, anyway. i'll wear it just like that when i get to colorado.  there's this black and red corset-looking tank top at hot topic that i've got my eye on. so pretty. and there's the dickies pinstripe pants that were the original ones i fell in love with. gotta get a pair of those too... oh! now i'm excited... i'll be able to afford it one i get my job. horray!   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ she had endured twelve winters and commited fifty sins  to play it safe is to lose but the bloody knife ...wins. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

       Current Mood:  Hang-over from hyperness  dude, the things i say when i'm hyper. heh. well i've switched to blogger now because it's BETTER... and i found a better nickname for myself (NOT xol... as cool as that was, it just wasn't me). from now on, i shall be kara. and when i am not kara, i shall be ruby blair. ruby - my birthstone. blair - just cool.  i find myself just remodeling all my things to darker colors (as opposed to the blues and greys of clay aiken). -_- change is good. don't get me wrong, i still need my clay music, but damn... did i really have to have everything with his face on it? that's... that's creepy, man! i really don't need to become one of those rabid claymates. those poor, lost souls. hey, clay could be god if he wanted to. that's a scary, scary thought.  why do i start to panic when i haven't received an email from andy in two days? *rubs temples*  well i'll just continue surfing around www.emilystrange.com, wishing i could have all that merchandise...

      2004-06-18 - 12:19 a.m.   Current Mood:  Strange and hyper  is xol a good enough nickname for me? we'll see how it turns out. xol. xxooooll. i think i like how it sounds... myeh.  it's time for change, you know? let's go staple some boiled eggs onto my bedroom walls. wait... if you can make that possible, i'll send you twenty bucks. i promise. anyhow since everything around me is changing anyway, i've got this opportunity flagging itself around in my face. kara! you don't have to be preppy anymore! it's time to wear black and pink! but more black. myeh. i tried it once this whole damn year... wore dark make-up, dark clothes. got so many good comments, it was crazy. jon told me that if i'd been wearing fishnets, he would have banged me right then and there. of course that had me backing away slowly but in the back of my mind there was that voice... "he thinks you're sexy! they all think your sexy! HOLD ONTO THAT!" pfft. now's my chance.  eve had mentioned sommat about a character called "emily strange" and i was kinda curious. well, i ran into the site, www.emilystrange.com , and my my. i like it lots, quite quite my new style, so to speak. i wish i had four black cats like that... instead i've got a blue one. but he's cute. *hugs piccolo close* my partner in crime! he'd follow me right into hell.  anywhoozles, maybe i should dump all these clay aiken cd's out. *looks around cautiously* umm... or i could just... keep them in a secret place... and take them out at night. *can't get to sleep without clay aiken music* goddammit.  gotta find something funky to do with the hair. i'm definately not dying it... tch! that would be trying too hard. besides i like the color of my hair, it contrasts my eyes well. i think just a bit of eyeliner and some dark clothing will do it. oh! and the personality... i'll just stay quiet, because it's not like thats NOT me...  i wonder what andy will say? eh he'll think i'm hot no matter what. er, he'd better. *clips leash onto andy* i'll try not to change... TOO much.  i want a fucking donkey. ugh. mom! get me a donkey!

      june 20, 2004 12:28am   Current Mood:  perky, cheerful, loving   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~ she had endured twelve winters and commited fifty sins  to play it safe is to lose but the bloody knife ...wins. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~   jus' a little something that i wrote up a couple of days ago, out of sheer boredom and weirdness. i think it's kinda nifty, so it's got a new home here in my blog, 'stead of my neopets user lookup. *innocent grin* so anyways, i showed "one last time" to nayeli and denise and... well... i kinda got the usual reaction. they said nothing, myeh. well i for one think the song is beautiful.  methinks andy is a little bit worried about me... it's made me calm down about these decisions i'm planning to make. sure, i've got a taste for black and red (and... hot pink) but i think i have to let him know that i don't want to get all creepy on him... -_- yes, i'll tell him. i can tell andy anything, and i usually do. i know he's concerned about me and that warms me up even more towards him... i'll email him right now. goddess, this boy is such a blessing in my life.

      june 27, 2004 10:44am  CURRENT MOOD: loving, creative  ugh, i hate plane rides. it was horrid, and i was nervous, and i almost got sick. but it's over now and thank goodness it was only roughly an hour and a half long. denver to phoenix.  on a brighter side, i'm falling more in love with andy every single day. it's crazy. distance sucks. damn you, boy, for being so far away! ach, curses.  eve is feeling better lately i believe... it's nice to hear from her, with a voice in her writing that's just more pleasant. i miss the old sarcastic humor of hers... maybe it's finally returning! ehe. good times, good times.  *reads over andy's last email* a house on the beach, with him? if only. that would be absolutely  perfect .
