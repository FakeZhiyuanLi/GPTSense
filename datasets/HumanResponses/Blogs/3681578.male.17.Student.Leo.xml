      today is wednesday and I'm writing about yesterday...one of my most dreaded hours this semester...  its about Filipino 11...a very dull boring time of the day...good thing its only twice a week...:-)  Salazar milks the most out these bugtongs and salawikains...yes, they may have culture and literature behind them but do I care...  I actually slept during his lecture-discussion of the poem "Kung Tag-Ani"...when he was discussing the last two stanzas I just couldn't resist and let my eyes droop into stupor...It was the first time a teacher made me sleep this sem...hehehe...  I'm gonna maintain two blogs now...I will be having another one setup on livejournal...just click this link if you want to visit it...http://www.livejournal.com/~easternoracle/  no doc mara next week and for the next next week...well, we will have "one of his colleagues" as ma 21 teacher so I think its nice having a change, I do hope he/she is fine though...anyway, nadelay na din ang long test namin and he'll be giving out sample exams daw...  um...this is all folks!!!

      I am posting again...mainly cause I am bored of the usual school work and kinda tired to read because of last night's stupid debut practice...   I have an early first class tomorrow so I might not post later...I have to get enough sleep so I can wake up early (without being grumpy)...and eventually commute to ateneo, reaching CTC by 7:15 am with just enough time to drop by gonzaga for a drink...   Come to think of it...I'm somewhat bored of having to go through the same process of commuting everyday...well, not as bored as I can be...mainly because I am only required to go early on Mondays and Tuesdays (I have 7:30 classes)...the rest? oh, Wednesday is 9:30, Thursday is 10:30 and Friday (with Intac) is 8:30...not much pressure but I usually arrive early at school and just do my homework at the library, I'm less distracted by temptations there unlike in home where there is pc that needs to be opened and a blog entry that needs to be posted...   Hmmm...the library is now somewhat a place of respite for me...there is now a "Physics Block" spot in the lib where we usually stay when we go inside the lib...wala lang...   And there's something else that is boggling me...well, not really boggle...   well...its just how people (my riscianthirdbatch people) are doing? are they fine? ok? wala lang...  btw, I do hope their ok...  I still haven't finished the readings for Hulagpos...but at least I have braced myself for the worst in my english and literature classes...  and I'm still thinking about Intac...like what is happening there? wala lang...I have this very shrewd idea, we will be asked to memorize the blue babble cheers and the alma mater song (ito parang mas relevant) and then our test will be fill in the blanks (or worse...write the cheers and/or lyrics)...  and for practicum, we are required to yell with the crowd in a UAAP game...hehehe...lol...  anyway...I'll try to post tomorrow na lang!   mwah!

      hay...grabe the week that was...(um, sounds startalk?!)  anyway, a ton of reading...literally, cayanan gave us this two stories to read in lit plus a couple of pages on the character...he might even give us a surprise quiz on monday, something I prepared for...hopefully, its another 10-item objective-type quiz...  back to readings...pesigan of english on the other hand gave this reading which I could not find in the handouts...well, actually...I just overlooked it, it WAS there...  anyway, and this joseph salazar guy made us read all the poems in hulagpos under the part Panitikang Tradisyunal...  {side note: last year in high school, my very favorite (note the sarcasm) book was THE HAMAKA...hehehe...it was in Filipino and guess what? my teacher was one of those who wrote it...a good reason why she keeps on blabbing plagiarism all year round...}  well, now in college...I have a new favorite book (again, note the sarcasm)...and its titled HULAGPOS: experimental na edisyon...  note the use of the word "experimental"...when I was in high school, I got into a LOT of trouble just for saying the word "experimental"...but I won't talk about that...  anyway...the dreaded July 5 is nearing...so I have to read/review for it...I have to get a decent mark in that test...well, I want to...and I need to...and its all that matters...  anyway...I do hope kindergarten is exciting next monday...I mean, its not supposed to be exciting but at least fun...only prince is having fun right?  I do hope THE prince doesn't read this entry or he might strangle me...hehehe...oh well...  I hate Filipino!!!  super...and I have this bad vibes that I will be put in Basic Filipino...wahahaha, an additional sem of filipino...shit! fuck! damn!  anyway...on the brighter side, no Salazar!!! hurray! anyway, I'm not even sure...I'll find out on friday...  anyway...I'm medyo sleepy...bye!

      Gosh...its our first quiz in math later...  I do hope I do well...kasi now I'm wondering why I took the CEP to get into the advance math class...  I mean, yeah, I know calculus alright pero the proving is just a shave to hard/confusing for me...  Well, I did prepare for last night and I do hope I go along fine...   Anyway, I haven't finished the 18-page reading for Filipino...oh shucks, its a LOT of poems...really...and its too damn boring for me...  And later I have homework for lit and english...hmmm...And I'm actually hungry but can't eat because of math...

      typically...I had my first ever puyatan last night...well, not exactly puyatan because I just slept at 12.30 am last night, I usuallt sleep at 1 or 2 am...  its just because I had a ton of work that needed doing...homework in math 21, two outlines in english (to be formed out of what should be a radical thesis statement), readings in Lit 13 (ah...di ko talaga magets masyado yung Aliens) and what else...yung 18-page reading sa Fil...  I'm starting to hate Fil all over again...mainly because I don't like panitikang pinoy...those ugly poems, boring stories, dull plays does not ensnare me and my reading senses whenever I read this...like many others who hate Fil...I just say that it is a big lump of useless words...  Another thing about me hating Fil is because of our Fil teacher in high school who bored the hell out of us whenever her period is up...we actually call her HAMAKA, from the title of the book she wrote and she is proud of...actually, its not even nice...being a Fil textbook and all...anyway, she was sooooo boring...sobra, to the max...with her stupid routines like..."o, magpangkatan na kayo" and "Tayo nang maglagom, bumuo tayo ng sintesis batay sa mga ulat ninyo"...when she gets angry she can go like, "Wag niyo akong subukan ha, magpapasensyahan na lang tayo" (Our section was IV-Patience) and "Hindi porket kabisado niyo na ang Pisiks Wan, ang Kemistri..." (She was referring to me...being the science wiz of the class and all...but tell you what, I haven't memorized Pisiks Wan and Kemistri up to date...)  And I still remember me sucking at her recitation about that damned El Fili, she was ranting on like, "O, batay sa teksto...Ano ang nilalaman ng telegrama sa wakas ng kwento?"...shucks, patay-patay na...most (if not all) of our class haven't read the thing...i was like nanghuhula na lang...and it was totally a fiasco even though me seatmates were coaching me with whispers...no one just seemed to know the answer...  Up to now, the content of that "telegrama" is still unknown to me...just like the fact that Pisiks Wan and Kemistri can be memorized...hehehe...  My English and Lit classes are next na so...this will be the end...  :-)

      Well...honestly, I do hope Cayanan doesn't give his surprise quiz on Monday...well, he just asked us to read two stories and two pages all THE Plot...  I finished all three readings but can't really contemplate on what the stories meant...well, I did absorb the whole plot thing but what about his quiz...do we get to explain the stuff about THE Plot or something...its a question about what to expect...so...wala lang...this IS my OC side...  And shocks...I forgot (but just remembered)...I have a CAD class on Monday so there is a great possibility that I may have to hurry to Berchmanns Hall if Arthur gives us an activity na...oh well, at least not from CTC to Bel...or Comm to SocSci...hehehe...  Oh well...

      hmmm...today is a weekend but I find myself still fussing over some school work...  1. Doc Mara (the dearest ancient wizard on the magic of numbers and functions) gave us homework...which, humility aside, I found quite easy... I still have to prepare for the dreaded July 5 though, the day when first stringent test in his field of numerology will happen...I do mean prepare...  2. Mark Cayanan (our witch-like warlock on the literature) gave us two stories to read plus a reading on the plot for monday...he even hinted on the possibility of having a surprise quiz...  and still more ka-OC-han on my other subjects...

      Upon reaching home I felt so damn fucked up...  I just found out that if I can not make it next Saturday for my "Erya"...I am out of GABAY...Tsk! Tsk! Then I'll be like David, a bum, org-less, I do hope he is not reading this...hehehe...  So there...Three Erya Absences and you are a goner...I already have one (last Saturday: Guidance Thingy) and I am gonna have another tomorrow (going to the movies with some old friends/my birthday celeb with them)...So I MUST not be absent next time...  There...plus upon reaching home my burden grew heavier...I have to do this collage-thingy for my little sister who will be badgering me till I finish it...and the thing is I can not tell her..."Why don't you do it? So you'll learn how to!"...shit! fuck! ok lang but I have a TON of work to do plus the fact that I am going out tomorrow leaving me just one day to do all my work...  Lets enumerate...  1. Lit 13 Paper on Sugar Coated Dreams...half-done...deadline-Monday  2. En 11 Paper on Paper Proposal...to be started from scratch...deadline-Monday lest I let Gimo thrust me into hell...  3. Ma 21 Long Test Revisions...hmmm...highly needed and must be squeezed in between school work and vacant periods...deadline-The Long Test is on Thursday...  4. Fil 11 Readings...hmmm...I haven't read much, maybe just a couple of poems and a couple of stories...deadline-there is no deadline but the next Fil class is on Tuesday and I MUST not come unprepared for class...  There...  I was kinda satisfied with Math kanina since I was successful in solving all the problems he discussed plus I even pointed out (to Dianne and Raj) more "elegant" alternatives to Doc Mara's solutions...  ***** is so obnoxious, so David says...pacute-pacute effect...anyway, change topic...  I just read Raj's LJ and Val's LJ...and I wish Val would indicate the Jerome she is mentioning in her blog...wala lang, just so people know...  Its my birthday on Sunday but unlike my previous birthdays I am not actually anticipating it...mainly because I can now get a "better" picture of what life is, being a college student and all that crap...  I have this new idea for this blog that I cannot put in to action mainly because I am too tired and exhausted to do it...  Come to think of it, commuting is sucking the life out of me...going to home is not as difficult as commuting to Manila as there is more heavy traffic flow there...but the distance does matter...  Several times I had thoughts like boarding, renting a small place/apartment, etc. In short, living near Ateneo...But I just can not imagine me waking up early alone...alarm clocks do not work on me...so I am actually handicapped in that sense (I can not wake myself up...shit!)...  oh well...   --Logged Out--

      Math kanina was not as bad as usual...I managed to figure out solutions for the Problems Plus questions Doc Mara discussed in class...I would even dare say that my solutions are more "elegant" than his...  I have two papers to do for the weekend, my Lit paper about the play Sugar Coated Dreams and my En paper about my revised proposal and thesis statement...  However, I would have to cram them on Sunday (my birthday) as we (meaning to say me and my old high school friends) will be celebrating my birthday tomorrow...  So there...I do hope I do well plus there is of course the burden of doing exercises in our calculus book in preparation for the dreaded second long test in Math 21...  I do hope everything goes on fine though...  There...

      I just had a terrific tuesday...  I started of my day leaving my house at 6 and eventually making the decision to ride the jeepney over the fx mainly because there were no fx-s at that time...upon reaching ateneo, my clock struck 7:15...yikes! I only had a small time to go/half-run to faura hall (F-320 to be exact) and there I only found Jim-Jim and a closed workshop, meaning I was not late at all...  I even had enough time to run off to Berchmans and arrange my locker and going there...I met Ms. Fritz, our ECE 21 teacher...I half-run/walked back to Faura and found the rest of class still arranging their stuff...  We continued doing our exercise, a metal case with 3 rows of drilled holes and a small box hole for a switch...I already finished mine after 3 hours of hardwork but I still have some minor finishings to do, I have to continue my A-streak there...  There, Ms. Lopez also released the results of the last 3 exercises we did on soldering, decoding resistors/capacitors and layouting of components...I got full marks for the first two while I got one mistake on the latter...All the same, an A class standing...  That was just the only class I am quite pleased...  Enter Schmitt Hall (C-109)...Math 21 class with Doc Mara, I found what he discusses quite easy (as always) mainly because I am quite able to follow him and predict the next steps of the solution...However, I am quite uncomfortable with the fact that our next long test will be on next thursday, though I still have a lot of days to prepare...  I just find his exams difficult but hopefully I'll score better in this one since the topic is easier for me, derivatives...So there, I think I'll just have a go on some of the problem sets at the book and maybe answer some sample examinations...  The day ended with me in Fil 11 class with Joseph Salazar...The class now proceeded to "Panitikang Moderno" so we have a new set of elements and concepts to extract in the next articles or so that we will read...plus I got a 9 out of 10 in the recent essay quiz which I was thinking of flunking...  So there...  I have a paper in Lit to start and an outline in Eng to finish...  So...    --Logged Out--

      We, meaning to say me and my English block and some other English blocks, just watched “Shoot Me with Your Sugar-Coated Dreams and I’ll Linger”, a play in Sharky’s bar in Timog Ave. It was kinda nice but it consisted of only several “dramatic monologues” done by two actors (a guy and a girl) with acoustic music in between…  The actors were great, shifting characters and all that but the story was just bursting with angst, frustrations and bitterness…The whole point, may be, is to expose and imitate what reality is now…full of angst and stuff…  So there…I also received the results of my dreaded first long test in Math 21. I was kinda happy in getting a C+ though a lot of other people got B, B+ and A. The 72/100 is already a nice start, I just can’t score lower than that to get something more decent…  I was kinda sad as well because I didn’t get full marks in the IVT question (10 points)…well, it was not that difficult, I actually found it easy and it was in that question that I had the most plausible solution…yet, Doc Mara only gave me 5 points in it…too bad! I would have been happier if I got a C and full marks in that question…all the same…it was not as bad as it could have been…just more efforts to get a B/B+/A…  I had more “fine revisions” in my thesis statement for English…Gimo apparently remembered to further correct out thesis statements…The thing about his class is you are so unlucky if you get to be the “Example of The Day”…luckily, I have already been chosen so maybe I will not be chosen again…just maybe…  We are doing the outline for the full 10-page term paper in English and though there are no classes for English on Wednesday, we are supposed to pass the papers to the beadle…  Cayanan, on the other hand, discussed and wrapped up The Summer Solstice by Nick Joaquin kanina…It was a nice story, nice in the most literary sense…It had a lot of ideologies behind it and it has a lot of good qualities…  We are supposed to have a debate-thingy next Wednesday and the winning group gets 20 points worth of quiz while the losing group gets whatever the two other English faculty members Mark will invite will give them.  So there…I do hope Raj did/is doing our Filipino project nicely…I mean, I could have helped but I can not, owing to the fact that the CD can not be opened…hence, no pictures…  So that’s probably it…  --Logged Out--

      Hmmm...  yesterday, we had this ultimately boring guidance workshop, it was nice at one point because I got to find out the results and interpretation of the guidance test we took, however, the activities were really sorta boring...  so there...I have no AutoCAD class tomorrow (free cut???) so I can go to school early and like do stuff...our Filipino project has not yet taken any decent form, we only have pictures, a few of which are really nice pictures (with technical value)...and we haven't actually figured how to lay it out and stuff...we are in the process of cutting it and stuff and I do hope we finish it at school...  ...for one thing, I have a new and relatively faster CPU now, the problem is that I can't use my scanner just yet because the installer won't work plus the floppy disk drive is not doing well...however, I this works faster and better so there...I also haven't figured out how to transfer my old files here...  I'm editting my friendster account, something I haven't done for quite a while and I'm gonna do stuff with this blog...  So there...sleep tight!  --Logged Out-

      I was sick for the past three days...Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...  But I managed to breeze through all the stuff, including the physically exhausting taekwondo...and I had to go to class to save my cuts for future use...  So there...the next long test in Math 21 is now  postponed until next week and Doc Mara is now back his normal usual lecture-like self...  I can't even see him letting us use Scientific Workplace...maybe he thinks that it makes Math 21 way too easy for us, so he wants the more...er..."didactic" mode of teaching...hehehe...  I'm starting to get a feel of Joseph Salazar now...not just because he gave me a 9/10 in our recent quiz but because I now know how he behaves in class...  He does not discuss the "literature" of the text at hand but the ideologies embodied in it...in away, I don't like him (feeling Philo no?!) but come to think of it...maybe that is what we are supposed to discuss...but subdues the act of reading the text into only a stepping stone, a platform for class discussion, an mere element for the construction of the idea of what tradition is...  Also...engineering workshop (ECE 21) is now slowly turning into three hours of hard work...I came late last Tuesday and I regret coming at all...I mean, I should have rested at home na lang...though if I did not come, I would have to do make-up work next meeting so I'll be sorta behind so all the same...there...  PE was so unfun mainly because I'm sick...I didn't tell the instructor last Monday that I'm sick and just went on doing the kicks and stuff...but yesterday I told Jobet and he ignored me...He didn't personally ignore me, madami lang nakikisabat so he totally forgot about me telling him that I am sick. Period  So yun...I'll write more later when I'm in Ateneo na!

      	I'm sick and yet I have to go to class tomorrow, unless I allow myself to be thrust by Gimo into the eternal fires of hell�By the way, I haven't mentioned this book I just read�its pretty nice and gives a nice introduction some of the most interesting concepts in Physics�its entitled Seeking Ultimates: An Intuitive Guide to Physics by Peter Landsberg�I didn't have time to scan the front of the book so be contented with the title.  	Anyway, I'm not joining ADS anymore, mainly because I'm too sick to do the interview tomorrow and because of several "signs" telling me not to join�too bad, sayang ang one hundred bucks but anyway, I've already made my mind up�not to join, besides ADS might consume a lot of my time and its good to keep my life simple�I have Gabay naman eh�  	There�I'm actually glad that Ateneo is doing well in the UAAP, not that I am actually interested in basketball or anything but I keeps my spirit high�hehehe�parang it gives us, Ateneans, bragging rights�hehehe�  	Also, I'm actually regretting the fact that I went home early from my cousin's debut yesterday�*this was not in my previous post*�kasi I didn't make the most out of the party�for me "making the most" out of something is enjoying it to best extent possible�siguro it was because I was with my mother and sister and it felt kinda awkward if I do the stuff I do in most parties I attend�although, they were sitting at the tables area and I was at the landing of the stairs near the dance floor�  	I do hope BJ already uploaded and sent me the pictures of the party so I can have some nice stuff to put on my website�I have no means of checking as I can not open the Yahoo WAP site using GPRS, damn it! So I can only check my mail on the pc�anyway, there�I have a lot of reasons to be pissed off�plus I am sick and I don't know what format Gimo wants for citing online sources�  	I do hope that MLA stuff can be found in the net, otherwise, I'll be going to class with a wrongly formatted bibliography�kasi naman, Gimo made us look for that "MLA Handbook" in the library where anyone could have taken it�well, it could not be taken home as it was in the reference section but anyone has access to it so I don't think many people from my English class got hold of it�maybe Rina or someone else from my English class who is industrious enough got it�well, maybe no one did�  	The way I write now is actually very similar to how Jerome David Salinger narrates in the Catcher in the Rye using Holden Caulfield's first person point of view�hehehe�I'm anticipating a Lit quiz tomorrow�I do hope I do fine though�My two quizzes each a rated a 9/10 (B+) and a 5/10 (D) so my class standing is somewhere in between, maybe a C+ and I have to get something higher than that�  	I also hope that I did fine with our recent AutoCAD exercise�the last mark I got was an 8/10 (B)�not bad but I could have gotten something higher�I do hope I do well in the next exercises�so there�  	On shifting, I was kinda thinking about shifting to the Physics-Materials Science and Engineering program instead of staying at my Physics-Applied Computer Systems program�well, basically�I'm considering it thinking that programming stuff is hard, and judging from my performance in AutoCAD, I might not do that well�but if I shift to the materials science and engineering program, which is more of chemistry and physics stuff�I stand a better chance of scoring good marks�its not actually paranoia or ka-OC-han in my part�I just want to be assured�that's all�  	Anyway, the two programs are still Physics courses�um, magkaiba lang ng flavor�so there�pero thinking of the job opportunities, Physics-ACS is better�"big bucks"�according to Patrick E�hehehe  	So I've come to this conclusion, I will shift only after the basic course in programming (CE 21)�if I find it nice and easy, I will stay�if I find it kinda difficult, I will shift in to Physics-MSE�  	So there�  	--Logged Out--

      hehehe...wala akong maisip na title...so yun...  Kanina was the debut of Lenin, my cousin, and moi was part of it, of course...I was part of the so-called 18 Man Dance...who are roughly 18 guys who were pinilit to join and wear this blue polo thingy and dance with Lenin...  It was kinda fun...throughout the process...i.e. weekend nights of practice...I got to know people, basically they are all connected to Lenin...there's of course some neighbors, Lenin's former classmates, Ninel's (Lenin's brother) classmates/friends...etc.  so there...the debut was fun kanina and Lenin and I had to do the script thingy for the hosts, just last night, and since we were both bangag, we were really exagerrating stuff...  I'm sleepy but I have to write some more...  On another note, Doc Pes gave us another paper and, in my case and that of others, some minor revisions on my thesis statement...which I am planning to do tomorrow...  Still, I'd rather try and do the A-problems in our Calculus book...and I have some stuff to arrange pa tomorrow...man, I have a lot in my plate...sobra, college life is fun, but there are so much responsibilities to handle...shit! It makes me freak out, and time IS wasted in me travelling for at most an hour...if I'm not gonna stop at the mall...  I wish I was a dormer...then, again...I absolutely can not wake myself up...I wish we lived near Ateneo, yeah, that is better...Hah...I have a ton of stuff to do, and I have this feeling that our next long test in Math 21 will be on Thursday...Doc Mara will arrive on Tuesday...  there...now are you happy? I hope you are...me, at this point I am...but there are just a plenty of things to do...shit! fuck! damn!  ...what a closing...

      Hay...about my ADS interview...  I first signed up for a friday interview but then I realized that it had conflict with my INTACT class so I re-signed up, thinking that I signed up for a thursday interview...  ...then came the ADS interview week...John P told me that we had consecutive interview slots...I, thinking that it was a Thursday interview, ok...I'll just think about what I'm gonna say...  ...along came Thursday...man, I was freaked because the morning came and I haven't actually thought of what to say...enter Math class...I was thinking of Illegal Drugs while Ms. Aberin ranted on Implicit Differentiation...I went out of C-109 without a thing in my mind on the drugs since I was reviewing my Differentiation from my memory...  ...then Thursday lunch, John P just came up and told me that our interviews are indeed consecutive but on Friday, meaning the day after that...so I was like, yes! Meaning our interviews were postponed...  ...enter Friday, today, before INTACT class...I just finalized my arguments about illegal drugs stuff and just after lit (my last class after the supposed interview)...I was thinking of my intro with Mennold...since we had a half-cut in lit, we went to caf early and settled at caf up...  I relieved myself of tension by trying to teach Raj and others Bridge that I just learned from GABAY...Then, enter 1200...my supposed time of interview, I had to like hurry to SS Consulation Room...when I reached the Faura-Dela Costa benches...I met Anna and John P...so we altogether went to the ADS Interview Room...  We, according to a sign on the door, have to knock upon arrival and someone had to admit us...he was a rather fat man...so there...we settled, all three of us and he just said that my interview, and John P's, was postponed since at least three people yata dapat ang manood sa amin...I was not really like, yes!, as the last time my interview was move but I was kinda thinking it was a sign...maybe it is a sign...  So there, my new ADS Interview Sked is on Monday...just before Math Class...I do hope it goes well na...  There...

      I haven't bothered to post about tuesday and I am too tired to um...post about yesterday...  I have this theory that taekwondo is actually a tiring activity that upon reaching home...I just sleep and not do any work at all...I don't know pero this past days, I haven't actually done a lot of work as I should have been when I am at home...  So here I am...I wanna do the bibliography thing for Doc Pes now...as in now pero I'm so damn tired...later na lang...  GA with GABAY yesterday was quite so-so, and I have to finish this sig sheet pa...and I'm meeting with my angel (Ate Gema) later so she can help me out...there... And I have this interview pa with ADS...its actually not an interview, we are supposed to give a 5-minute speech on what is supposed to be a "very debatable" issue...there...I haven't actually thought about what to say...Man, I might ruin my chances of getting in...and I didn't submit the Guidon Web requirements na yesterday because I was...er...tired to it...  And its a sign, the Flash MX I installed in my fucking pc didn't work, meaning I shouldn't apply for Guidon Web, maybe next sem? or the other? but not now...  I'm actually freaked out at my ADS speech later...I have to...er...tie myself up during math in order  to um...do it properly...   And I got a new quote from pier...Never expect to much! The more you expect, the greater the pain! Thats quite nice...  Um...sige, I'll post emails pa...  --Logged Out--

      last monday was a blast, well, not really...  getting an 8 out of 10 in the previous exercise in Computer-Aided Design was not bad but neither enlightening, especially when others got 8.5-9.5...all the same, there is room for improvement...  we were given another set of exercises to do...with a little difficulty, I was able to finish the first one...the other, I wasn't able to finish owing to the fact that I wasted time entering wrong commands and in doing the previous figure...  then at English, I was given a chance to feel the...er...eternal fires of hell of Gimo...I just found myself there blank and had to scour my brain for answers when my mind was kinda wondering away...I had all the answers in me, I just did not get them out...hehehe, anyway...it was not that nasty...he made me realize some points through the experience though and gave us R17 folks a ton of work to do...which is mainly writing parts of the research paper...  at Lit, I, as usual, fairly enjoyed the class with a shade of participation...maybe it was because I was not at all pissed off at the things that I was able to focus on The Hitchhiking Game by Milan Kunder which Mark was able to round and tie off during the meeting...we'll be doing A Rose for Emily next, according to my blockmates, Emily is kinda necrophilic...in "rough" terms, she has the tendency to have sex with a corpse...talk about obnoxious...  I'd better prepare for Mark's usual "start of topic" Surprise Quiz...hehehe...on maybe Point of View...  After Lit, I was not able to join my block for lunch owing to my need to deposit in a bank (my stipend)...so there, I had to hurry without lunch to SEC Lecture Hall C...I was not late at all, Ms. Aberin just caught me nibbling cookies from my bag...she even said "pasimple pa, huling-huli naman" but she was not angry or anything...  Later, she made me solve a problem on maximum velocity (note my "delight " at the thought of answering a physics problem)...well, it was an application of derivatives in physics and was actually easy...her examples are easy, contrary to Doc Mara's examples...which are exceedingly tough!  So anyway, she also gave us a quiz (two items) on derivatives pa rin, just to know if we understood how to plug stuff in the differentiation formulas...it was not bad...just long actually...  Afterwards came the tiring taekwondo session where we were asked to practice the first basic form with groups...our group did nice though not really nice-nice...um, just so-so  So there, Kindergarten was fun where someone discussed Implicit Function Theorem...it was actually nice because we had Reina and Patrick explaining (and/or subduing) the concepts in our math (just enough calculus to know what continuity and derivatives mean)...In my opinion, the theorem he presented was actually very evident...also, knowing topology was nice...of course there were the munchkins we were munching while the speaker was writing on the board...  So yun...after that medyo tiring day, I was not able to do work...  I'll post about this day later...

      woohoo! nice headline? anyway, it was nice...well, the next best thing to being in THE GAME...Ateneo won! Woohoo!  Wala lang...I'm kinda thinking of improving my blog a lot...though, I have ideas, I don't really have the time...plus the fact that I can't use Flash in this damn PC...  hehehe...I'm also worked on my writing stuff...i.e. continuing my past compositions, sketches, biographies, versions, other stuff that I do whenever I get too damn bored...  now, I'm working on poetry...yes, my dear old dreaded friend...poetry...wala lang, I'm really planning to compose a song, well, a part of the song...I'm kinda rusty about guitars na cause the little I know has sank away into the unexplored and untapped realms of my brain, deposited there with integrals, derivatives, vectors, projectiles, waves and the like on top...hehehe...  so back to composing, my hs classmate Caren and I had this sorta bargain in composing the song, she'll do the music part by adapting it on what I wrote...and if I remember, uy, we also planned on one song about ____...ok change topic [sana natatandaan mo pa yung ibig kong sabihin Caren]...  and we just had this really stupid though fun debut practice...at least, I found some new acquaintances from my cousin's (the debutante) friends...hehehe...  I just don't want to sleep yet...I've finished my paper for Gimo (I hope it goes well) and practiced a little of basic form 1 for PE...what else to do, Guidon requirements I think?! but I'm not really thinking of doing that anymore...  um, there...so basta, I'll try to get sleep na before I wake up at 3:30 to do exercises in Math, then off for a bath and I'm heading off to school for my first class in CTC...hehehe...sorry if this is just nonsense, its just that I'm so bored...   *yawn*

      I'm now sorta developing this thing that I call Sunday Syndrome...  er...it is characterized by an entanglement of emotions due to the close proximity of another school week (i.e. Monday is now approaching)...  well, maybe that's the OC fraction of me pero I just feel like nervous, happy, excited, angsty and doomed all at the same time...  Lets see what I have for tomorrow...  ECE 12-AutoCAD stuff with soon-to-be Engr. Arthur Gerona...um, not much about this...I do think he will just give that routinary discussion of stuff in the AutoCAD Manual without much exercise...  English 11-Writing stuff with Dr. Pesigan (dubbed as Gimo or Doc Pest)...um, he assigned this "research kit" thingy where we should be placing all papers and the like about the "full-blown" research paper we are doing...well, I'll just have to buy a bunch of stuff like index cards and folders on Monday sa Caf to shut him up...Oh, and I have another revision for my thesis statement and theoretical-conceptual framework...I hate this stuff, reminds me of Booty (our Research teacher in High School...or should I say Research Facilitator)...who doesn't teach a thing contrary to Gimo who rants about stuff about writing...i.e. specificity, passion and  zeitgeist...uy, word of the day...zeitgeist (spirit of the times)...and synchronicity and diachronicity...and stuff...  Literature 13-Fiction stuff with bitchy Mark Cayanan who, as the class discovered last Friday, sometimes feels the need to trot of to the Xavier-Berchmans Pocket Garden to smoke, hehehe...we haven't finished Hitchhiking Game yet so we are doing that, I presume...its a kinda stupid story where...oh well, you are not interested are you...  Block Lunch in Manang's? Well, its kinda like a block thingy na so maybe we can establish this stuff...though I'm planning to deposit some stuff na at BPI Katipunan during lunch time, kasi naman they close up at 3 something and my class ends at 3...so I have to do it at lunch...  Math 21-Differentiation Techniques with Aberin, Doc Mara's sub, who luckily only gave us practice work...  PE 131-Taekwondo, oh, I have to pratice form 1 pa pala...wala lang...  ok, since that is that, I'll do stuff na and luckily finish before um, 7 pm, because we will be practicing in Scrapyard Resort at 7 for my cousin's debut so there...  --tsk! tsk!--

      Ooh...damn it...  Since I last posted here I felt like too angsty...  Friday was fine, or at least it went fine for me...Math class was nice since I knew what Aberin was ranting about...Differentiation Techniques and stuff...English and Literature classes were so-so...  Dr. Pesigan gave as some work for our "research kit" in English...he who gets an F in the research paper automatically gets an F in his final grade...so be cautious...  Mark's discussion, to his disgust, was interrupted by the bell so we didn't have homework except to read the new readings on Point of View and A Rose for Emily...pero according to my calculations, we'll be doing that on lets say wednesday pa...owing to our need to extend our discussion of The Hitchhiking Game...  Ow...and I forgot Intact...it was totally boring with our two "facilitators"...well, its not that boring but it was not so-so...we had to do GDs and stuff according to their will...and do lectures and stuff, hell, they might even want papers...oh, and I'm also the Physics Group Beadle while Pendix is the CS Group Beadle...so we had to prepared the directory stuff for our groups...its nice having Val do it [thanks Val]...so there...  Hmmm...Saturday was kinda fun...I went to a UAAP Game and Opening Ceremonies...  I had to wait for an hour for Ancar and Caren to turn up so I spent it reading a new acquisition from the library...its nice reading...um, I'll post it next time...When we finally met, we were like talking about stuff and comparing stuff and all...until we reached Araneta...  Upon reaching Cubao, we got my ticket and went to meet Ancar's friends who has their tickets...so we entered na and settled ourselves in the UP Crowd...we had to relocate about three times in order to be sure that we are in the UP side of the stadium...  It was kinda nice being part of the UP crowd...a crowd who is famous for their cheers (and not for their players...hehehe)...The Atenean block was super empty...owing to the fact that Ateneo has a game against La Salle today...today...as in today...which, on my regret, I can not watch...  So there...and I also found out that all schools [I think] raise their right fists and all when singing their respective Alma Mater Songs...[I thought only Ateneans do THAT for Song of Mary...di pala?!]  Tapos yun...When I went home I felt very much angry at that Express Teller terminal in Angono...It just kept saying transaction cancelled...so I couldn't withdraw money (which my mother was asking for)...damn!  Due to her mandate, I called up BPI and reported and stuff and even asked her what was the nearest branch and where was the next terminal and so on...However, my mother insisted (after I ended the call) that should have had pressed more on the operator for immediate action...right, like they could swoop down instantly to our terminal and fix the whole stuff...  Then, my father made me buy stuff, again to my repulsion, because I was doing school stuff, no kidding...  To add more to my angst, my mother did not allow me to watch the UAAP Game...Ateneo vs La Salle...which was one of the most awaited games...oooooh, damn!  even more anticipated than the finals...I'm actually praying now that Ateneo and La Salle both make it to the finals (which is not exactly plausible) so that I can watch their clash...  She even brought up the idea of me asking for permission to go out again the second time on the weekend...yeah right...there's not much to do...[well, there is a lot to do but only unimportant stuff]...  Oh shit...and to add to that...the Flash MX I installed in this damn stupid fucking PC is not working...bullshit! How can I work on my Guidon requirements without Flash MX...nothing to impress them...  On the brighter side, Guidon might actually just consume my time if I become accepted so its fine that I don't get accepted (I just lost a hundred bucks)...oh well...  So there...I'm thinking of posting pa later...I haven't ran out of anst just yet...

      hehehe...  I'm not actually gonna talk about ORGASM...as in the orgasm...  I'm talking of ORGanization Affinity SyndroMe...gets?! (Sorry kung corny...lol)  Well...change topic...ayaw ko na ng orgs...  About kanina...the play Enemy of the People...[note disclaimers ahead...]  It was not as bad as I thought it would have been...talk about sarcastic huh?!...anyway, it was kinda nice...ok, I'd dare say I enjoyed it...It was not terri-terrific...but it was nice...  The thing about it that I like was the way TA adapted the play...the roles were well-played, I'm impressed actually...nice set and props...nice lighting and effects...  I just didn't like the way the setups were planted...I mean, they could have done it better...like making the actors seem like audience by lining up and not having to place special chairs for them...that way made it kinda scripted...too-scripted that it was not nice...but overall...the play went fine...  I do hope I can watch the opening game on sunday if and only if there are still tickets...  So there...I'd better sleep...I have INTACT on Bel-311 tomorrow...and my friends say its just GD...as in GD...as in GD...   ZzZzZzZz

      Today is thursday...  I'll be watching "Enemy of the People" by Tangahalang Ateneo...mainly because Dr. Pes required us to do so...I do hope its fun...well, I don't expect it to be fun but I hope it is, even slightly...  Um...I only have two 90-minute classes today...Math 21 with Ms. Aberin, Doc Mara's substitute, at Schmitt Hall (C-109)...and Fil 11 with that damn Joseph Salazar at Kostka Hall (K-301)...  I'm actually enjoying classes in Math with Ms. Aberin mainly because she does not follow Doc Mara's...er..."Methods" of Teaching...she is active and likes response from the crowd she is teaching...  Joby, Clark and another math classmate of mine will be leaving today supposedly for IMO...I do hope what Joby said comes true...that we are going to have free cuts in Math for the whole next week...hehehe...  Filipino is so damn din...I forgot to tell you that last time, he gave me a 6 out of 10 for an essay quiz for which I expected full marks...kasi he didn't tell us that he was looking for the "kabalintunaan" in the poem, he just asked us this and I gave him that and even cited from the text...anyway, I'm not fuzzy about that anymore...  I have a paper for English that I'll be doing this night and I have a whole lot of work for the weekend that I may not be able to watch the UAAP Opening Game with my classmates...  Its not the game I'm fuzzy about...Its about maintaining bonds with my classmates which getting more and more difficult by the moment...tight schedules, organizations, school life, etc. There are just to many hindrances...  However, I want to push myself to go to UP on friday kasi I told my friends I'll do so...the next available moment...  So there...  I'll be discussing ORGASM with you next time...    Until that horny moment...    Mwah!

      so there...eto na yung mas tragic na part...  I was sorta liking Mark Anthony Cayanan na...as a teacher...  But it really felt bad that he gave me a 5/10 in our Literature Quiz...well, its just a quiz...but I really felt...um...demoralized [yeah right!]...so there...I wasn't expecting full marks, I would have been so shocked if I did...I'm not as smart in English/Literature as Rina Alfonso or Ms. Lasang is (I don't know if I spelled Ms. Lasang's surname right?! I don't know her first name.)...  But that 5/10 which has the equivalent of D was like telling me that I WAS STUPID...so stupid not to recognize the motivation of characters, the rationale behind the action phases, the conflict hidden amidst those lines...its true that I was not a literary afficionado before I stepped in Ateneo but when in here...It gives me a different perspective...that there are enjoyable forms of literature aside from the popular books and bestsellers that I have read...  So I was thinking that I may not be the expert in these stuff pero I know how to appreciate them na...so if that means that I'm only merit a D, then I have a whole lot of work to do pa pala...well, its not actually Mark's fault...its more of mine pero I was just so pissed off that I didn't speak/recite in his class as I usually do...by throwing off a few lines...  Its just that I thought I deserve more than the mediocre, the mere pass, the D...but if not...I'll have to accept the reality...like many of my classmates in my english block...I'm not that smart...all I can do to these stuff is appreciate them from different vantage points...depending on my mood or feeling...or on how I connect with the discussion...  David is right...not speaking in class does not mean you don't understand a thing...it only means you don't feel like speaking...the things my classmates answers in an English/Literature discussion...I normally have them in my head...I just didn't felt like speaking up or if I did feel like reciting, someone has already said what I ought to have to...  So there...I still like Cayanan as a Lit prof...Its just that I didn't merit a D kanina in our past quiz...pero how stupid of me...  Hehehe...

      hay...two major events already happened since I last posted here...  one...our first long test in math where I am in a flip-flop stage...pwedeng D or C or C+...  two...kanina when Cayanan (that bitch) gave me a 5/10 in a Lit Quiz...  I'll go through them one by one...  The Long Test in Math 21-Block A (AP) that is being taught by Dr. Jose A. Marasigan ang is now being handled temporarily by Ms. Aberin...  Um...it was not as bad as it ought to be...though I was not able to prepare for it much...  Well...it consisted of 7 questions plus 1 bonus item...the bonus item is time consuming and can be answered by moi in 30 minutes...the alloted time was 90 minutes...  I was able to go through all of the questions...1-7...1 being composed of 5 subitems where we had to compute for limits...it was nice...and the epsilon-delta proof part was not that bad, though according to David...my proof is wrong...anyway, I was able to answer all of them, though some of them were carelessly answered but as for the bigger picture...it was fine...  I thought my score was already merited me at least a D or a C, a C+ is not impossible though a B, B+ and A ARE impossible...I just think I am in the flip-flop because my solutions for all the items might not merit me full marks...I do hope it does and that he is lenient...  To get a D means to get at least 50 points out of the 100 total points...I wasn't able to use the proper solution for the bonus item because I only had 20 more minutes to answer it...literally, the time was inadequate to complete all test items...at least bonus lang yung na-miss ko...anyway, I made up shorter solution for the bonus item that will yield a different result pero that was the only way I could answer it without making up all sorts of number...I had to derive din the half-angle formulas pa...since I already forgot them...  So yun...so much for my long test...lets go to the more tragic Lit 13 quiz...

<post>

	 
      um...here I go again...  typing useless nonsense stuff...  anyway, I finished the homework in Lit 13 na about The Hitchhiking Game by Milan Kundera...its a...er...nice story...well, its about two people, a guy and his girlfriend who sort of plays this game as if they didn't know each other...the girl pretends to be hitchhiker, unknown to the guy, whose main purpose is to seduce him...the guy plays the role of the driver, whom is ignorant of the girl...and just plays along with her as if she was a whore...it was nice for me in the sense that there was s lot of psychological and sociological interplay between the two of them...I can't wait till we discuss it in class...not that I'm anticipating it...its just that Lit class is a LOT better than Pinoy...  Fil 11...sucks...well, last time it didn't really...siguro because we had a faster pace in the discussion of poems...okay, I'll go Filipino...um, tula...and I exerted an effort to answer his questions a lot of times...talk about active participation...kasi the thing about Salazar I hate is when he tries to extract all the aspects of panitikang tradisyunal from the tula at hand...like trying to get the monarchical power distribution from the tula Para sa may mga Anak na Dalaga...I mean oh come on...yes, the economic, catholic, and other structures are there but like trying to get orange juice from grapes...  Anyway...Risci feels kinda stupid now we are not there...Booty (our former Research teacher) is still the research teacher of seniors...However, the juniors have a new research teacher...Aragoza, I'd daresay Keith's favorite panelist...*note the hint of sarcasm*...anyway...there...  Oh and there is a new system for research na rin...um, the junior had to defend um, three titles and the panelists had to choose the best title from the three...talk of stupid...unlike in the first three batches of Risci graduates where there was diversity in topics...all researches that I saw now are about cream for ganyan ganyan sakit...remedy/cure for this...endless applications of garlic to human health...oh come on...talk about improvement huh?!  at least during those times, there were researches in physics, chemistry, materials science and others...ok, its not that deep...but at least there is the effort to...you get the point...  I do hope that some Riscians stumble upon my blog...they will find it nice reading...  Um...I'll try to wrap up my ADS essay na ok? so...  bye!  mwah!

      Um...  I really have no idea what to right now but maybe I'll eventually stumble on something to type as I continue punching the keys of my keyboards...  Um...  Ok...here goes...I just found out the Guidon OrSem and the STOA Fusion are at the same time, Wednesday-430-630 so its obvious that I can't attend both...  Wait...you don't know what STOA and Guidon are right?! A little briefing, there's this thing in Atenean Life called "Rec Week"...short for recruitment week...its like a small fair at colayco pav where orgs setup booths to give info to freshmen about their orgs and eventually ask them to sign up na rin, if their interested, for a price...um, maximum of a hundred bucks per org...  Basically, I signed up for three orgs...Guidon, which is the official student publication in Ateneo...Ateneo Debate Society (ADS), one of what I consider prestigious orgs...with them being Asian Champions, National Champions, etc. in debating...even with UP aroung...mind you, their tag line was..."Give us an award or contest in debate, we probably got it..."...well I joined for two things, one-the prestige and two-the oral training even if I have no debate experience (thanks to my good and nice school!)...anyway and last is GABAY, the org of scholars and is also a socially-oriented orgs that helps out little kids and teaches them and all sorts of nice things...  but there is no assurance that you'll get accepted for all orgs you've signed up for...so basically, they narrow down the applicants into the best they can have...unless their object is to train them...  I have an ADS essay to finish pa...and I'm not quite in the mood to right about politics...i.e. federalization of the philippines which is my chosen topic...I was supposedly going for the science topic but my view was different from what I expected my view  was...gets?! um...nevermind...ok...  Talk about school work...Cayanan gave us homework on Lit about The Hitchhiking Game...something like summarizing stuff or whatever...basta I haven't done it...might as well scribble it down tomorrow...and Doc Pest gave us about three readings yata...which, luckily, I have finished earlier...and I have this Math Long Test, which, hopefully, I will pass...though I have to try everything I can to scrape that passing score...If I'm lucky, I might even scoop a C+ or B...  So as I was saying...I have this conflict with Guidon OrSem and STOA Fusion...STOA is an org of DOST Scholars where I belong...It is pressingly important that I attend that, however, I still want to join Guidon...urgh sana di na lang ako nagsign-up dun...I saved a hundred bucks pa...anyway, I do hope I can untangle that knot tomorrow...  And ow shucks...film showing again tomorrow...and I do hope Raj is able to buy the protoboard for ECE 21...otherwise, I may have to skip the film and go to Cubao, Farmers to be specific, to buy that PCB 201 for soldering on Tuesday...  And I have to review pa...um...shucks...loads of things to do...I'd better just sleep...     ...ZzZzZzZz...

      yesterday, I returned to Risci, my old school, to get some stuff of mine...mainly my AJSS diploma and certificate, which was so damn important to me...  It was kinda nice having to see the place again after what 2-3 months...anyway, people there were not as I expected them...they were not really that shocked about having a visitor, at least one of my batchmates dropped by each day...so I was the "flavor of the day"...I spent my time mostly with Ms. Jenny who is celebrating here birthday today...and with Engr. dela Rosa, our ultimately the best physics teacher...anyway, so that was it...Ms. Rain was still the same Ms. Rain...weird, eccentric, nice, and um...nothing more...  Oh and wait, I had a conversation with Roda pa pala...she was our former batchmate of mine...former in the sense that she got a scholarship for singapore amidst our third year life which she took...last year though, after her school year there she went back for vacation...she however was not allowed to go back due to health problems...so she has to take senior high school here and behind us by a year...she told me she is now planning to take up AB Political Science...  she is also in IV-Patience, my former section, and I think under the ehem...advisory of Ms. Rain din...  One thing nice about my visit in Risci though was that Mrs. Aguila/Weng/Baby Factory was on leave so I didn't have to see her...anyway, If I did see her...I wouldn't even care to say hi or wave or flinch my head a bit...Hell, I might even dare say "f*ck y**" to her...just for the heck of having the freedom to say those things to a former teacher...  Mind you, she is not my idea of a teacher since a teacher is someone who "teaches"...not someone who is paid to give you exercises alone...someone who should intensively scrutinize our essays and term papers...not someone who gives only 90s and 75s...someone who should show the correct format of writing letters...not someone who publishes a wrongly done promissory note in her periodical test...um, someone who knows the difference between a course in Technical Writing (for sophomores in our school) and English IV...the hell! Isn't it obvious that I like her *note the sarcasm*?!  Anyway, so there...I even made an excuse to go home early...that I was going to UP or going to watch spiderman...mind you both didn't happen because I had decided not to go anymore since I had to prepare for that dreaded tuesday (long test in math) and that ADS essay...  so that's it isn't it...  um...   mwah!

      well...tomorrow is a no class day here in Ateneo...its Faculty Day...  well, I sorta mapped what will happen na tomorrow, I'll go back to Risci to get some stuff then onwards to two choices: one is to watch spiderman with some of my high school classmates...the other is to go visit my other high school classmates in up-diliman...  I prefer the latter cause wala lang...I just feel like doing so...And I can watch spiderman 2 with my people naman sa weekends...  The day of our long test in math was moved, thank God! Well, it means I have more time to review and focus on Limits...still, proving using epsilon-delta is sorta not my stuff...I'd rather compute...anyway, the fact is it is moved...  doc mara will be leaving over the week end and our class is assured of two mara-free weeks...well, we will still have classes but under one of his "colleagues"...hehehe  well, its filipino again tomorrow and I try my best (just as last time) not to sleep in front of Joseph Salazar...I do hope I succeed this time...  anyway, I still have to read some stuff in Hulagpos and go to Schmitt for Math 21...so bye!   Mwah!

      Subtitled: The Art of Making Note Cards   I was preoccupied by the progress report that was due tomorrow for English 11 regarding our research papers...  Basically, I fabricated progress so that I have progress to report in my progress report...Gets?  I will be consulting with Dr. Pesigan tomorrow. Period. I have to tell him about my research paper and stuff. Period. Do I have to sell myself out? Nope, absolutely not. I just want him to reach out to me.  I still have to do more of my "desperate measures" plus my Literature 13 report needs attention so I will have to end this post right here...at this very spot!

      I am quite fed up with panitikang moderno...which is basically half of what we discussed in the first half of the term in Filipino...  But siguro it is not all that bad...the poems here (not all...mind you) are quite great and good reading...you see the drama in them that I never saw before in our high school Filipino readings which was basically centered on Hamaka...plus the plays (though long they are) are actually nice...well, Paraisong Parisukat was too damn...but they were...unlike Duplo (way back in panitikang tradisyunal)...  Then I thought and re-thought about my Lit paper which was due on Wednesday...the only story I have not read is Araby and it is too damn long that I decided to settle myself with Graffiti by Julio Cortazar and The Walk by Joy Dayrit (which I chose over The Virgin by Kerima Polotan)...  The Graffiti is a unique story, mainly because it uses the second-person point of view...since the mode of narration is different, it creates this certain "excitement" in the readers (well, to me at least) and makes them go for more...  I still have not though about our report though, sorry Group 1...I'll just ask them for the stuff...  I have to go read some stories pa...I just hope that Salazar will just ask us to write stuff about the stories (panitikan) in general and not as specific stories...(conflict between kolektibong identidad and personal na identidad)...  And the thing about eroticism is it dramatizes the modern concept of sex (read: modern...postmodern is different in terms of critical theory)...  Damn! I am a Physics major and yet I find a growing interest in this stuff...hehehe...   --Pulotgata ni Danton Remoto--

      I just started reading (and rereading) Hulagpos all over again and I actually chose this (plus quite a handful of other tasks) over spending the day with my old high school people back at our dear old school or going with the AJSS people to eastwood...  It sucks when you have to cram a ton of work that you could have done earlier but you did not do just for you to have time to do more enjoyable tasks, not exactly worthless tasks like talking and talking in the Physics Block Bench, but doing or practicing or reading other stuff for the other (more enjoyable) aspects of your academic life...  At least I have solitude later, peace and serenity, as my sister and mother will be going somewhere...Yipee! I have all the place to myself...  I have not yet bought the ECE Power Supply Kit and I have absolutely no idea how to buy it...I mean, maybe on Monday...just maybe...or maybe I can ask someone else to buy it for me...  There...Shit! We have a report in Lit, War by Luigi Pirandello, and my mind can not make anything much out of the story...  Um, I should actually spend my time more productively now so I might just solve some math problems along side reading the whole of Hulagpos along side writing note cards and the stupid progress report for my research paper in English...   --Logged Out--

      I am back...I have this great urge to blog and blog some more anyway...I got the idea from Raj...indirectly...so thanks...  1. Anna Santos is our new block representative and she just started what I will refer to as her "reign" kanina in Bombita when she was bitching THE MA21 TRIO about not coming early because she reserved daw the whole line for the block pero other people already seated themselves in that row because we were not yet there or something like that...I do hope Anna reads this...  2. Our Filipino Project just got the highest marks in the class, together with Aira's Group...A B+ plus the honor of being recognized by Salazar for our craft and for David, a D class standing in Filipino...Still, an A in Filipino is still out of reach lest I have an A paper on Bombita which I am targeting to do this weekend so as to let some others read it so I can improve it...  3. I have not yet read three stories of the four that I have to read for my Lit paper...actually, we are only supposed to choose two from the four but if I want to get an A paper here as well, I have to read all stories and choose the two which I found were the best...I have not yet decided what option to take (Sir Mark gave us two options...one, choose the prominent element of fiction in both stories and explain how integral it is to the development of the story...or two, what is the similar thread of the stories and explain)...plus he said that we have to cite textual evidence...  4. I just had a conversation with Patrick E kanina about Physics stuff and I found out that us, Ma 21 peeps get to take Ma 22 plus another 3-unit core subject next sem...although I was like Yipee! I thought of the drawbacks especially getting a History subject in a semester when I am studying Filipino, English, Literature, Ballroom Dancing, Calculus and Calculus-based Physics...  5. I am trying to convince most of block V to take ballroom dancing next semester and so far, only Val and I have the initiative to do so...well, as Anna says...it all depends on the schedule...  So there...Time to do work...   --If f'(x)=g'(x)...--

      I am so exhausted with a TON of work to do...  Still, the burden of service hours are futher lessened as I just did 6 hours kanina...so technically I have only an hour more to go but I decided to spend the bulk of my free time with COMELEC na rin so I have extra service hours...  It was kinda easy...you just sit there and assist...  Anyway, I am gonna flunk another math quiz...mainly because I was too tired to do homework yesterday...now, Doc Mara gave us a written homework so I have to do that...  There...I watched Bombita kanina and it was a smart and nice play...really...  I have two papers to draft over the weekend and I am gonna ask Sir Mark stuff about my paper for Lit tomorrow...  There...    --Logged Out--

      Hay...guess what...  Math Long Test results were out kanina and I got a 69/100 (C+) and I am currently feeling bad about it...mainly because I am at the mediocrity level in Math 21...  Of course, upon reaching home, the paranoid side of me got the calculator and started punching the figures and I have a class standing of about 71% (still C+) and even if I ace all the other long tests and quizzes...the highest point my final grade can reach is B (using Doc Mara's grading system in the syllabus)...so there...  However, he said in class that if we improve in the course for the next half of the term, he might give a greater weight to the better half...plus, my lowest long test will be cancelled so I still have chances...to score higher...but still not an A...  So there...I just billed in 2 (or maybe 3) service hours so great, I have 7 (or 6) to go...plus I can finish all of that with my volunteer work tomorrow (still as a COMELEC Volunteer) by sacrificing all my breaks...  So there...the COMELEC people were nice naman and the work was easy...well, exciting actually...me and another real volunteer just went and brought a karaoke machine in the CSR tapos I just had to time the speeches of the candidates and stuff, which was the fun part cause I got to watch the "miting de avance" and I made some of the candidates extra scares whenever I flash the "30 minutes left!" sign at their faces from my seat...hehehe...  We just did more hard work in ECE yesterday and we are now working in our final project, a power supply, which is 50% of our final grade...  There...we did "mock promotions" in PE kanina and it was not actually fun...kinda boring na rin I'd daresay...  Sige...I have several pages worth of Hulagpos to read before the midterms so there...    -ZzZzZzZzZz-

      I just felt so accomplished today...  1. I was able to complete a template (complete with borders and title block) in ECE 12-AutoCAD kanina with nice remarks from Sir...  2. I was able to cross the dreaded raging river we call midterms though, in my opinion, I was not actually able to satisfy the items of the test fully because of lack of time...I do hope to get a C+ or higher as I have (according to the work Mark has already released) a C+ standing and a higher standing is actually better...  3. I was able to sign-up for volunteer work in the COMELEC for Freshman Elections on Thursday-Friday and if I am going to complete all my shifts there (meaning spending ALL my break times at the polling station)...I have already completed my required service hours...so I my burden has now lightened...  However, I still have a ton of work in my plate...that will require more rigorous chewing and tearing before I achieve the required results...  1. Research Paper in English--meaning interviews to be conducted, related literature to be read, and so forth...  2. Quiz in English--damn! we have a quiz on wednesday? on fallacies...we are now discussing logic and critical thinking and its kinda nice having Gimo utter these latin phrases such as petitio principii and ignoratio elenchi...  3. Report in Literature--War by Luigi Pirandello and I can not make anything out of the story, really...oh well...  4. Report in Filipino--Di Ko Masilip ang Langit ni Benjamin Pascual and this will happen tomorrow and we (meaning to say TEAM ABUSO) are not that prepared but we have the ideas and stuff...and that is important...  5. Midterms in Filipino--I have to read a ton of stories in Hulagpos that I have not read before...*sigh*  6. Paper on the Short Story for Literature--well, I have not read the selections yet and I better start doing it if I want to get something as decent as B+ or higher...  7. Quiz in Math--oh...this is tomorrow, helpless...I'll just use my time for other stuff...hehehe...on second thought...I am now focusing on Extrema...  So there...happy??? I sure was but not anymore...   --Work, Work, Work--

      I forgot to tell YOU...last friday, a part of the block had their second trip to the LST (Loyola School of Theology) Caf...an extremely cheap place to eat with wonderful food and refillable drinks...  Look what I got for 47 bucks...A serving of spicy pork something, veggie side dish, rice, gulaman (that is not so fun) plus this extremely delicious turon that I am craving for...  Now I promise to eat there at least once a week for their extremely good turon...although it is actually kinda far...it is located far beyond the Comm Building and Manang's...  Plus I have two other cravings...well, not-so crave-able food but I find them nice for their prices...Waffle Combos from Wafflers at 35 bucks per combo, good for breakfast especially before English during Wednesdays and INTACT during Fridays...  The other is Wraps by Healthy Kitchen, Chicken or Crabstick Wrap that is so good as well...with a healthy serving of nice crisp veggies, nice dressing and er...nice stuff...although its much more expensive at 45 bucks each...  There...I am now in the process of rereading and reanalyzing our stories in Lit as practice...  I find the next pair of stories for Lit nice..."Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" {yes...this is a fairy tale} and "Snow, Glass and Apples" {uh...no disclaimers just yet}...its so nice...I actually can not explain what "nice" means without saying disclaimers so I would not...ok?!   --Bye!--

      I had my first "erya" in Gabay kanina...  It was hard, trying to explain what the types of nouns are and how to add fractions with different denominators to section 9 grade 6 students...it was kinda fun though...not really...maybe so-so...but it was not great...  TinTin and I were "first-timers" so we really felt kinda stupid at first...then, we were actually "section-less" but we soon figured out with the help of Arvie that I belong to section 9 and that TinTin could replace someone from that section as well...so we started...  First, Arvie gave his kids break and I would have followed suit but Kuya someone told me that we were not supposed to have breaks...I was actually very hungry at that time and so were my students...  It was also kinda stupid because I was not able to prepare much since me and TinTin did not have "lesson plans"...I promised my kids that I would give whoever got the highest scores in the test reward...  However, I soon found out that what the right things to do were...I kinda thought everything was lame at that point...but Kuya someone had a point...but I agree with Arvie...there is this dilemma...all Gabay people are supposed to do "erya" every week but some do not attend...like me and TinTin...we are allowed 3 absences yata and beyond that, you are knocked out of Gabay...but if that rule will be imposed, there will be fewer "tutors" for the "tutees" and so the remaining tutors will have to shoulder the responsibilities...  After the erya, I went back to Ateneo to return a book in the lib and borrow another one...then I went to other places to get stuff...  Now I am supposed to reread the stories and get a strong grasp of the Elements of Fiction for my midterms on monday plus I will do my version of our report outline for Filipino which is due on Monday...  By now I feel nice about my teachers save Dr. Pesigan and Dr. Marasigan...I actually like Salazar now...I definitely liked Mark Cayanan, Arthur Gerona and I found Fritz to be very nice...  There...I'll try to do work now...  --Logged Out--

      the test kanina was so freaky...  there were 8 questions (last test, there were 7) plus a bonus question which neither David nor Raj, I think, was able to solve...  so there...I am in a flip-flop stance again...I just wish I will score more than what I am expecting...a C at least...please please please...  I was pissed off at the related rates question...I was already so panicky that I solved using the rather longer method...  My mind was not functioning well so I forgot the so-called "Law of Cosines" so I solved the related rates problem using simple trigonometry...  More nerdy talk...I got a quadratic equation that works two ways...you can solve it using a variable in terms of the other and vice versa...  I solved it, and it was quite long, for one variable...just before I took the derivative...I realized I should have solved it for the other and so I had to repeat the quadratic formula all over again...  Add that to the time I consumed solving it using normal trigonometry when I could have used the cosine law...shit!  Anyway, Life goes on...I still have a lot in my plate...  1. First Quiz in English on Fallacies...  2. Literature Report for Next Week??? on War by Luigi Pirandello (a not so nice story)  3. Filipino Report for Some Other Time??? on Di Masilip ang Langit (a so-so modernong panitikan story)  4. Midterms in Literature on next Monday...  5. Midterms in Filipino on next next Tuesday...  6. Service Hours as Comelec Volunteer on Thursday-Friday next week???   There...  I am actually feeling fine and comfortable in Filipino class now... (Good for me!) and so much so in Literature...    --Logged Out--

      hehehe...  midterms in Lit 13 and Fil 11 are now approaching...  long test in Math 21 now showing on thursday...  research stuff (interviews, library work, participant observation) to be done for our research paper in En 11...  reports in this month for both Lit 13 and Fil 11...  template for ECE 12 to be analyzed for Monday...  GABAY Erya this Saturday...  Service Hours to be done...  pcb layout for ECE 21 for Tuesday...  shit! a lot (or rather a TON) of stuff to do...  yet I can't manage to cram reviewing in math...  everytime I arrive home I feel so battered...I just have to pick up a book ang lie down in bed...and then, uncontrollably, I fall asleep...  I wake up at 3 am next morning do stuff that really needs to be done and take a bath by 5 am and leave home by 6 am...  Go to school, pass stuff, speak up in class, try to do lib work, play cards, eat, tell stories...in short...be unproductive...  Shit! I need to get on...I have to gain the momentum I had at first...plus I haven't had any major subjects yet...I have to this...  I must...so I have to stop this and grab myself and try to solve review questions in Math...  so there...  --logged out--

      Hehehe...I (or rather we) actually ended up going out kanina...  However I was able to do two out of my four set tasks...my two papers in Lit and Eng...  Believe it or not, I just watched Spider Man 2 kanina and Catwoman yesterday...they were both nice movies...  I found Spider Man 2 nicer than the first mainly because I was able to grasp the introduction of the storyline more...maybe because I am now more "mature" in a sense...  Anyway...I have to get sleep na as I have a 730 class tomorrow at CTC so there...  Just went online to check mail and stuff...   --ZzZzZzZz--

      its my birthday today...happy birthday to me! happy birthday to me! (sounds like harry potter?...Hi Harry! Belated Happy Birthday din!)  it is, as always, fun to receive messages, calls, email from people wishing me a happy birthday...  however, unlike my previous birthdays, I am not actually happy that it is my birthday...  for one, even if I want to celebrate it today...I cannot...not because I already went out yesterday but simply because I have school work to do...which I already enumerated last post...  Hmmm...I can not finish my Lit paper, I do not know why but I find it hard continuing it...siguro because it is my birthday...after all...  there are also things I am looking forward to this week (my birthday week)...  1. a lunch date with my good old monster friend...  2. a long test in math (not actually anticipated...its more of dreaded)  3. nice comments from Joseph Salazar about our photo essay, it may noy be as good as Anna-Val-Omi's group but at least its nice...  4. a nice decent class standing in ECE 21...  there...  I might post later...I just might...
