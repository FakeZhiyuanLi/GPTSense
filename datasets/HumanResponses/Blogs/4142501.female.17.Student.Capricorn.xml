      Hello everyone ok so let me tell you why I'm finially happy. Today I went to someones house and wasn't childish, immature, or stubborn. Ok I was sttubborn but that is who I am. I wasn't stubborn to be stubborn. I feel like today was the first day I was able to talk to this person in a very long time with out being weird or not real. Honestly today was the first time I really was real. Today I proved to myself that I have indeed grown up. I thank this person for giving me a chance,, and I feel that today I proved myself to this person. I love you and my feelings for you will never change. Anyways I got to go. Hopefully I'll be on again before next weekend. Later  RJ

      Thursday, August 12, 2004  Ok so here is my schedule..  Med Term   Litke, D Math 3      Barnett, D Eng 4     Quam,R Eng 3    Davis, K No 5th                        Ok so thats my first tri. So for the first 3 weeks of school I'm still going to be lifeguarding. But that's good 'cause it gives me something to do after school each day  US Govt  Peterson, N Eng 4  Cook,  H Math 3   Barnett, D No 4th No 5th                       So that's my second  tri. So tell me if this makes any since.. I took math4 last tri. But my schedule say's that I'm taking Math3 right. Well that's because they couldn't move me foward,, so they move me back. But anyways.  Hist 111    Litke, D Hist 111  Litke,  D Eco-Fe    Lowry, B No 4th No 5th               So that's my year. I'm hoping to get a job at the Pecan Plantation Club House this school year after I get finished working at the Pecan Plantation Pool. But that's all as far as my year goes basicially.      So lets talk about life ok.... So I'm really hoping that the person that is at Northwood University is having fun and doing well,, My younger sister just turned 13 today!! Yeppie!! I'm a bit worried about her but that will be on another days blog!! I've had a new life choice thrown at me lately.. I could be a police office and only have to go to college for two years or I could go with my life long dream to become a nurse. But I'll figure it out. This Medical Termnology class could do either screw me over or actually help me. I thought if I wanted to be a nurse it'd be a good idea to take this class. I'm highly aware that it will be harder than shit for me but I'm superwoman and I plan on sticking with my saying.. Don't be scurd, Be purpered,,!! Anyways that's all for now. Later. Love to everyone who has delt with me this summer. I realize I took some of my anger out on soe of you that I'm friends with or am in love with. But I'm sorry and I'm trying to go back to being able to get into my shell while at the same time say whats on my mind and what I want. Later
