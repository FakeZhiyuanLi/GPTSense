						   It has been one eventful day, for sure. First off, Natalie gets bitchy about me not liking Mike, and a bitch fest ensues, ending up with me blocking her. We argued all over a damn thread, then I blocked and deleted her and Mike from MSN. Friendship over, it seems. Whatever. Now she can free up her time and devote even more of it to Mike. Mike isn't even all that good looking anyway. I've seen much better.  After that, Ali tells me that she loves me. This was a shock..she said she loved me for a while, but didn't say anything because I was with Nikki. Ali ends up winning me over.......

						   I'm so tired of misdirected feelings..I'm tired of loving "her". I can't get rid of my feelings for her, no matter how hard I try. I won't ever lose the hope that her and her lover will break up and I'll have my chance at her..I'm so stupid. Why can't I just forget...it was something never meant to be.

						   It's fucking hot in my room and my PS2 broke...oh, the inhumanity! Arguing with Justin about how he's changed didn't help cool me down either. He's a bit too stupid about his looks these days.  Well anyways, it's getting real late, and Mandy is my only entertainment. Sleep now, hehe

						   I think that I am becoming my best friend Natalie. I'm GROWING into her. XD Both my blonde moments and typos have been much more frequent than ever before, which is a sure danger sign. I believe I am developing *gasp* St.Louis Stenographic Syndrome, as Justin so eloquently put it. I fear for myself. O_________O

						   Below, is why I hate two of my oldest romantic interests.  Well, Sana faked being in a coma to see how much I'd care for her. Yeah...what a great friend. Not only that, she became a bitch about how DPKT is run, and suggested that she'd tell Invision about this board so it would be deleted. Yeah...and she became a bitch about the forums AFTER she cheated on her boyfriend with me. And on top of that...she's an immature, incompetent dumbass.  As for Hikari...gee, where to start? She got into a lustful relationship with me by telling me that she loved me when she really didn't, and kept begging me to screw her everytime she posted. When she got mad at me about anything, she pretended to be her friend Caitlin so she could cuss me out. When I figured out it was Hikki (which was easy, since the real Caitlin told me it was Hikki all along), both Hikki and Caitlin denied that anything had ever happened. I KNOW THAT I WAS GETTING BITCHED AT, KTHX. I'M NOT THAT STUPID. I really don't care if she ever talks to me, since she's on her, what, second boyfriend since I broke up with her. Yeah...love forever my ass.

						   My first post in my new blog...now onto my incoherent ramblings, yes? ^_^  School's kinda getting me depressed. In order to pass my Finals, I have to get good grades on everything (including Algebra...ewww), and they're forcing me to type up some long report AND 24 creative writing assignments! Jebus, why can't it be easier to pass? ;_;  I started feeling better when I got home though. Today was my girlfriend Nicolai's birthday, but unfortunately I did not have the time or money to send her something. However, proclamations of love and romance, and a beautiful poem was able to suffice. ^_^

						   I'm officially single ladies...and now you'll keep your legs closed from now on, then. >_>  Yup...Colleen broke up with me...seems like she only liked me as a friend..which was weird, because the day before she told me she was in love with me. I wish she had her feelings sorted out before telling  me she liked me. Oh well...another failed "relationship." I run through girls toooooo quickly. It's really sad. >_>  There's been some romance sparking between Stephanie and I. :O I really don't want to date anyone though...I'd rather just stay single and flirt with her. That would be better in the long run, and would prevent needless heartbreak.   And I've started liking Sana again for the last month or so...yea............................................................................ god help me. -_-

						   "If you cyber with a girl while you're in an online relationship, then you're cheating."  Is that right? >_>  Well, I suppose I cheated on Colleen if you ant to look at it that way. I was really horny, and Steph, who I used to have the hugest crush on, told me she wanted me. @_@  So yeah...I took the opportunity without thinking of the consequences (as usual) and did it...SOMEHOW Justin knew I had done it and he and Nat started arguing with me over whether it was cheating or not..and at one point Nat said that I was classless and was no good to women. And of course Mike had to say it again. Newsflash: HAVING MIKE SAY ANYTHING TO ME DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. >_>  So I'm just going to have to talk to Colleen and hope she doesn't hate my guts afterwards. >>  Also, I got to see a new picture of Sana. Oh my lord is that girl hot. Just....wow.   Anyways, yea. Summer school starts on Monday, as well. Reallllllly not a good weekend. -_-

						   Seems like things turned out all right after all. Colleen and I stayed up until about four in the morning talking (XD), and there was actually some serious talking going on. :O  Even though Sensui/Sesshomaru kept trying to persuade Colleen into thinking I'm a bad boyfriend by saying I abused Hikki, Nat, blah, blah, Colleen thankfully didn't listen to that jealous bastard. ^_^  It was kinda romantic, hehe. I made a topic in the Love House forum at ADG about how much I care for her..then she told me she loved me and wanted to be my girlfriend. I'm finally happy, hehe.

						   I've got such an empty feeling in my stomach. Yesterday Colleen told me that she thought me and her were closer when we were just friends..and she told me she still isn't over Artem yet. She only wants to be friends. I didn't act all moody and angsty towards her, and supported her decision..but I've just got this huge emptiness of a feeling inside me. :S

						   Today's been a weird day, haha. It started off boring as usual, but around the afternoon, Nat called me! ^_^ OMG, she has such this sweet and wonderful voice that definently lives up to her moniker as the Sexed-Up Schoolgirl. We talked for exactly 1 hour, 20 minutes, and 19 seconds, which was a long phone call for me. XD  And that brings me to the suckiest part of today: Nat and I's argument with Marcelle. I told Mar that I was talking to Nat on the phone (hence my "On The Phone" status on MSN), and she asks "Are you two having phone sex?" I told Nat, and us three got into a major bitch fest. This seriously made me realize that Mar is a lying whore. I mean c'mon, she even TOLD ME that she was my whore, then denied it when Nat was in the conversation. And she said some mean-hearted, scornful comments to Nat. >_> All in all, I am so glad that I chose Colleen over Marcelle.

						   Well, I totally went against my prior idealogy, and started dating again as of today. Apparently Nat knew that I was going to ask Marcelle out. Well, I guess she was right. I ended up asking Marcelle out. Of course, she obliged readily. She's been wanting to date me for months now. @_@ It doesn't really help that I also still have a crush on Colleen. X_X

						   I have *finally* figured out what my problem is when it comes to relationships. About time.  You see, I've had quite a few girlfriends in not much of a span of time, and I know why. I truely loved Nat, and when she turned me away, I tried to recapture that feeling of love I've felt for her. Often emotions would get in the way, and I'd get into a bunch of quick relationships that end in heartbreak. That's exactly what it is. I want to actually, honestly love a girl, like I've loved Nat.   I've been hurting every day about this, and really haven't said anything. Just keeping quiet except for a few times, usually looking for a new girl to rush into a relationship with, in hopes of finally falling in love again. I swear love is a drug, and it's something I've been addicted to since I fell for Nat.  As soon as I met Nat, I became this romantic, always writing romance stories and everything about love...I always wanted to live out those stories but it's impossible.  Nat says my biggest mistake is me going with all these girls..but she's the reason why I'm doing it. I swear to God I wouldn't be going through girls like this or being so attached if I had never been in love before. So it's a never ending cycle until I find a girl to love....but I ALWAYS rush things, because I want to feel love as quickly as possible.  Basically, I'm screwed. I can't get love out of my head, and I'm just going to keep hurting, and hurting, and hurting...nice to know that my first love ended up being the biggest mistake of my love life.

						   I'm not doing too well..Ali broke up with me...and she's yet to give me a reason why. She was fine yesterday..so what happened? I SWEAR I can't get a girl who won't hurt me....I just need to back away from relationships period. If I'm going to get into another one, I hope it's a long time from now..that's all I can hope for.

						   Ali's parents think Ali should go to the hospital. They fear that she's dying..but of course, Ali's rebellious self says she doesn't want to go and is going to run away if she has to go to the hospital. I think this is bullshit. She NEEDS to go to the hospital, what with her throwing up blood everyday. She doesn't want to go and is going to run away? What the hell? Doesn't she even care about what happens to her? Or what I'll do to myself if she ends up dying! I mean god...doesn't she take anyone else's feelings into account? I do not want her to die, yet she's rushing her death by staying up 109 hours straight, walking out on the road by herself in the middle of the night and then getting raped, not eating, and avoiding hospital visits. She won't even listen to me...she just keeps saying that she doesn't want to go to the hospital and she'll just run away...I'm powerless basically...she won't even listen to her lover. I just don't know what to do anymore...

						   Today's been kind of good, I suppose, which is a big plus. Whoo.  Nathander came back, and that was definently good. We talked about lots of things, like what's he's been doing these past few weeks, Chobits, relationships, the tie of the Gnotism religion and FFX, everything. I'm certainly having fun talking with him, and my conversation goes on with him, as of this writing.   And I got to talk with Ali late last night, which was really good..I had spent about two days without talking to her, unless you count her text message convos which only lasted a few minutes. It was so fun talking to her..and a bit romantic, hehe.

						   I've been pretty depressed all day..for about three reasons. Let's see...  I am getting REAL depressed about my outer looks. I see nothing good looking about me, I really don't. I don't know if it's just normal teenage Linkin Park-esque angst, but I really do think I'm ugly. Nat and Mike's lil threeway about the subject didn't help much either. If I actually was good looking as they claim, girls wouldn't run away from me, laugh in my face, or flirt with me all school year out of sympathy.   Okay...I REALLY miss Ali...I have only been able to talk to her for a few minutes over the last two days..and I miss her so much. Of course I'm worried about her too...what with her illness and what happened to her a few nights ago. And I'm across the country, unable to be by her side. -_-  Thirdly, I must begin Summer school in a month or two. *major collective groan* And I must do Algebra..and if I don't pass it, I must repeat the ninth grade. >_> Not how I wish to spend Summer. Not only that, if Ali can indeed make it over here this Summer, I have no way of meeting up with her without telling my parents about her. ...they don't even like me talking to people on MSN or AIM, let alone meeting girls I met online who I might possibly have sex with. They'll kill me. X_X

						   Sigh..I'm not having much fun, hehe. I wanted to see that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie, but I have no money and had to watch my annoying lil brothers, so no go. Kyray kept going on about how it sucked and how the Dementors looked like umbrellas...XD. But whatever. I'll see it eventually. My fangirlishness depends on it. XD  On another note, I really miss Ali. I haven't been able to talk to her since yesterday night, and she's the only thing I've been thinking about all day..either I'm worrying about what's happening with her, or I'm thinking of all the romantic things I want to do with her...either way, I couldn't get her out of my mind. Mary suggests that I may indeed be in love with Ali...hmm..only time will tell on this case.

						   I don't know what is wrong with this site and my computer..haven't been able to create a new post in days. Well, whatever. ^^"  I *love* my new hair. Those pictures I posted at FC can't do justice to it.  It really looks that awesome. When I looked in the mirror, I for once actually liked seeing my reflection. I can tell I'm going to be a picture whore when I get my digital camera, hehe.   In unrelated news, my feelings for Sana have been lessening and my affection for Steph has been increasing, which is really, really good. I've recently started having dreams about Steph, so I know where my affection lies. ^^"

						   Wow, been so long since I've posted in this thing...crazy, hahahahaha. Well, since I'm bored, I may as well do a run down on my thoughts.  Ahh...school begins September 2nd. I dunno whether to be excited or downright nervous. I moved from such a small lil Christian private school (which started with only 3 students XD), all the way up to I think the biggest high school in my city. More than 1500 students. @_@ I'm going to dread having to go up to the board to solve a math equation I don't get, especially since I'll be looking like an idiot in front of so  many people. Gaaaaaaaaah. -_-  Let's see...Summerslam is coming from the Air Canada Centre (I think that's the arena) in Toronto, Canada, and is only a couple short weeks away. Yay. I'm looking forward to the Randy Orton - Chris Benoit match for Benoit's World title. I'm pretty sure Orton will come out on top and become the youngest World champion in the titles's illustrious history. :D  Hmm...things are going really, really well with me and Marcelle. We're in love, hehe. And our one month anniversary will be on August 18th. :O :O :O
