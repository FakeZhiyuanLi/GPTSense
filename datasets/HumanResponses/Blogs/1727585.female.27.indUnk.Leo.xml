      i'm happy for bryce that his interview went well today but i will be mightily pissed off if he up and tried to leave before i do. it's hard enough to work at this place when he's arround! i did take the giant leap of committing to school though. finally had a chance to speak with the lady who runs the program and the final words is no way in hell will i be able to make the city center campus for this term. my options have all of a sudden been reduced to millwoods or ipsos and i categorically refuse to work here any longer than is absolutely nescessarry.  saw daniel today. he shaved his head. he's an odd little man but i miss him sometimes.  and the party on saturday is moving ahead nicely - rick and vaness won't make it what with the big race in cowtown and all but peaches and matthew, mena, bryce and danielle, sky... have all confirmed. should be a shindig but geeze i hope the kids can all play nice together or it's going to suck hard.  think it's time for me to have my daily ration of kettle corn

      graaaaaaaaaaaaah !!  i am so insanely frustrated!! i serriously want to cry but that will harldy improve the situation now will it? my husband calls me just as he's getting off work and he tells me that he didn't have a verry good day. immediately the warning bells go off - with his track record i just get so damned nervous whenever he mentions even the slightest thing about work not being fantastic.  apparently today circled arround a complaint from one of his fellow operators that he was laying down on the job while the boss was away. and apparently this is the second such complaint in as many days.

      geeze louise i feel so bad!   my partner and his cauc bitch (there's a story there) gave me a lift home tonight which was cool cause a) i'm lazy and b) they're just really great to hang with but shortly after they dropped me off they just about t-boned some dude up at the end of my street so naturally my knickers are in a twist the second he called me to let me know. i feel like somehow i'm responsible for that dillhole that turned in front of them (yes, against the light)   feh, i serriously need to unclench! they're both totally fine, just a little shaken  in other news - had a big pow-wow with the elders at work today. worlds of fun, oi. to be fair it could have been alot more painful but really all this meeting accomplished was to cement my confidance in my decision to 'pursue other opportunities'. the role of corporate shill has never sat particularily well with me and so it is that it's become harder and harder for me to work with a straight face. i can't be bothered to give a damn about a single, solitary thing in the place and truely, as a purported leader, that's a problem. oh hell, i know that's not true - i still care about people and things that happen at work and i wouldn't  really  want to wreck everything before i leave... that's the real problem for me: having to reconcile my burning desire to be fully completely apathetic towards everyone and everything with my inherent mother-hennery.  one with some sort of mental health backgroud would likely ask me if it would be easier if i just didn't give a shit - hell yeah it would! and that's why i  try  but still the little angel on the other shoulder says...  honesty - that's where it's at folks but how do we get there? i know i have trouble telling myself the truth with alarming frequency. but really, lying, denying, defying... doesn't get you any further, doesn't make you feel any better in the long run so what's the attraction?  to heavy for me tonight but something i'll likely think about for some time comming.

      isn't this a hoot? i've wanted to put pen to paper (or fingers to keys) for some time now but somehow i just haven't gotten there yet. and, as is so often the case, now that i'm here i haven't the foggiest notion of what to do. the whole personal biography thing is great and all but that's not what i'm after, i'm looking for catharsis and retyping my life resumee isn't going to get me that.  song lyrics are always a pretty good jumping off point. or my day at the office. or my husband. or my cats. so what's the issue? just pick one!!  my husband: fascinating story. he farted in the shower this morning. and not just a wee little poot, no this was the gastric emission to end all gastric emissions. you have no idea how brutal it was. he's no bed of roses when he lets fly at the best of times ( honestly, who is?) and a hot and steamy shower is NOT the best of times. disgusting i know but it's like the stench becomes trapped! you can't breathe and you start to gag... serriously i had to get out of the shower, out of the bathroom altogether lest i yak all over my clean self.  my day at the office: naturally i shared this heartwarming tale with my partner at work (great guy, incidentally - i'll really miss him when i'm gone) and so it went, we started talking about spousal shower contact then miguel chimes in with his shower story. apparently he had often wondered, you know - since the water in the shower is hot and all, if his woman would notice if he peed on her while they were in the shower. long story short the answer was no. from anyone else i would think he was jerkin our chain but this one... not too sure.  and the song lyric of the day is : " i'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright, i carry them with me today" sophie b hawkins

      time for the post-party analysis!  for the most part i was pretty happy with how the evening went. i wish i hadn't appeared to be such a space-case but that's really okay, these people had fun and so did i. pissed right off about the pictures though - grrrr... friggin panoramics. and this is why i don't take pictures very often. *sigh* i am proud of my home and all the work i did on it yesterday, veryone left well fed and with enough behind to keep us in smoothies for months should we so choose.  tonight though, was dinner with my mom. it was really great although i know tha she had expected to be out and about a whole lot sooner than we were but i really needed the sleep- i slept from about 10:30 or 11 to 3 o'clock - at that point it made just as much sense to wait for paul to come home. so we did and recycling will have to happen another day. at dinner though, i saw pictures of not one but two new babies - tamie had hers friday i think and nadine's boy was born the day before i had to get my d&c. while i was still at the table i was fine but shortly thereafter we popped by to pick up my pictures from london drugs and became unaccountably pissed off about them costing what they did and being total junk anyway.   it wasn't till we got home that i put the pieces together and cried. it's funny how it still sneaks up on me - i mean it's been over two months and i thought i was doing okay but ... well it passed more quickly then it did in the begining. it's not as fresh i suppose, but it's just as deep as ever.   i worry that i'll never be able to carry to term and have to have this feeling every day for the rest of my life. i know i should feel joy for maya (maia? miah? mayah? miyah?) and connor as well as their parents but what stands out most in my mind is that they aren't mine, i can't or don't have them. and it doesn't feel fair.  if i hadn't miscarried i would be close to 6 months right about now. to see someone who's come to the end of that particular road is really searing. darija and melinda are both out to there and hard to deal with in their own way but i think that somehow i'm looking arround that more - not so much seeing them as they are going to have babies but seeing them as just pregnant and hell, even  i  can do that one. it's the follow-through that  dropped the ball on and i just avoid thinking of them in that way.  i'm likely not making a huge amount of sense but that's because i'm thinking in circles, as i am wont to do when i'm upset. how cruel is that? when i most need to figgure something out i spend hours chasing my tail.  i think i should start a story on here. maybe put down something i allready have on file. like my whitestone story. it bears consideration. i could use the typing practise at the very least. i've gotten a little rusty and what with only a month before school starts i could stand to be a bit better than i currently am.

      and another thing  I'M UNEMPLOYED !!   i realize full-well that i'm going back to school right away and that this is fair and logical to be unemployed but geeze it's scarry. to have voluntarily pulled myself out of a safe situation to essentially throw myself into the whole school thing when i have no real notion as to wether or not i can do it...   to be sure, i needed a change and i really had to get out of ipsos. too long in one place had made me more than a little complacent and that's never a good thing. i'm going to miss that joint though, so many people and experiences that i never would have encountered in the outside world. not to mention the steady paycheque.   the money is a big thing, ever since paul and i have been together i've been the breadwinner. he's been the bread eater. and that's the way it is. not anymore. now i will serriously depend on him to keep the candle burning because even with a student loan it's not like i'm actually making money here. it's a subsistence loan, not a lifestyle-to-which-you-have-become-accustomed loan. bills are going to be beyond tight for a little bit but at the end of the (10 month) tunnel i should be able to put everything back on track. i just hope the shitstorm can be subdued that long.  i'll have to work anyway, i know i will but i can't get into that right away. i plan on giving it about a month if at all possible. there will be quite a few things for me to get used to what with school and all so i'd prefer to have a little time to ease myself into things. then i figgure i'll go call centre again, likely advanis because the pay is fantastic as parttime work goes. one catch with that is that the student loan people seem to feel that my award will be affected should i earn more than 200 $ a month. bah! that would equate with approximately 24 hours in a month assuming advanis @ 10$/hour. not likely that i'll be able to work such short shifts and so few of them but i'll call the nice people at student finace and see. now that i'm really thinking about it i didn't get the full amount of loan i applied for since as a student i am expected to contribute to my own education. perhaps then, they will allow me to work more than that to overcome the shortfall.  either way, i'll leave off it until the end of september when i'll have settled into my school routine and gotten a handle on the transportation aspect. by my troth, i think that's going to be the sticky wicket but then again it's not like i've never travelled extensively on ets before and for the most part i'll be riding against the major traffic so i should be okay. tomorrow is the test though, first day of school and i need to be there by 8 am. my bus will have me there by 7:54 but when i get there i really have no idea where to go. besides i'm deffinately going to want a smoke before i go in to a different and somewhat scarry place.  the upshot is that it's an english class. i consider myself pretty fluent (you may not) and i expect i should do fine in the course. now if only i knew what textbook was required of me...

      holy dinah, it's almost been a month since i put anything down!  colour me wretched!  but to be frank and honest - things have been a little hectic lately between school and work and shopping for both. yesterday spent a good part of the day @ ikea spending the gift i got from my team (100$ gift certificate) the key things were the dressers, one each for me and paul but aside from that i bought a collection of plants and pots for them, garbage cans, toilet brush, corkscrew - you know, typicall ikea shopping.   good thing my mom was there though, because paul certainly wasn't doing much to entertain me. from the minute he woke up yesterday he's been acting like he's got a burr under his saddle. and arrogant? don't get me started !! i think the overall mood was petulant child and god did he embarass the hell outta me. i mean serriously, grow the hell up allready! just because we don't agree on something does not give you the right to stomp off and pout. and while we're on it, conceding a point every now and again will not cause the world to think less of you so you can bloody well suck it up and admit when you're wrong, goddamnit!   the worst part was that he always seems to treat me like shit arround my mom. she can't think too much of either of us for that, or maybe she can but i would have alot of diffuculty with that if i were her. if a really step back and analyze the picture i see that this is an ongoing thing with him, this treating me particularily poorly arround my mom. it's a problem and it's been a problem since we first moved into oliver place.

      i have this idea now that i need to make a list of all the things i want to do every day and actually do them every day. stuff like make the bed, do the dishes etc. an unchanging list that starts again every day. thing is... not sure where to start - consistancy is not my forte. i think what it is is my quest to establish some sort of routine because that seems to be 'normal' and 'acceptable' whereas, by extension, my life often is not.  i've been tossing arround a temporary plan of attack all day and i think i have a jump-off point.  1. brush teeth  simple, basic, happens every day and it's easy to stick to.  2. clear off kitchen and bathroom counters  sounds low-grade but actually it will take some getting used to, i'm much more accustomed to letting things pile up unmanageably.  3. collect interest on neopoints.  well i've gotta throw in at least one enjoyable thing  aside from that i'd like to have about ten items that rotate through the week like vaccuuming and other household chores, writing email to friends, working on crafty things like sewing  and clearing out this multitude of mixed boxes.  so that's the plan but who's to say where it will go from there. i'm all about the planning stage but i have great difficulty following through   and speaking of planning, i've decided to post a list of broad goals to accomplish. some will be broader than others but i think it will be good for me to acctually commit them to the internet instead of knocking them arround in my head  without further ado...  1* set up scanner 2* finish flash cards for next term 3* work out budget (finance and time) 4* establish balance 5* get a job  6* get rid of excess clothing 7* formulate a list of staples and a system to maintain them 8* discover what i want in a house 9* resort bookshelves  10* find a more appealing way of displaying my treasures   and of course there's the long range business - i'd like to develop a 5 year plan ... or would i?  no maybe not but i really feel it would be appropriate. that way i could feel like i was actually heading somewhere even if we were to change course a dozen or so times. i'll mull it over with my husband  speaking of whom... i love him. i know that shouldn't seem so odd, i mean i married him for cryin out loud but sometimes it just sneaks up on me. today, i was watching him watch the italian job (remake) and he just struck me as so attractive. he was wearing the pyjamas he got from my mom for christmas and he looked just the way i'd imagined my husband to look. funny though, i had no idea what i'd imagined my husband to look like but when i saw him today i knew that was exactly it.  makes me feel so much better to get those little confirmations from time to time.  a la prochaine

      i just did this quiz at lifenetwork here's what is said  " Life is not going to live itself  It's a proven scientific fact that putting things off just makes them one-thousand times worse. Get off of your butt and do something. And while you're at it, use that God-given spine. Sign up for a dance class, learn that language that you always wanted to, change the sheets on your bed for once. Do anything that could be considered even mildly ambitious before the rigor mortis kicks in. You need a hug. "  i've never been more accurately nailed down.   and today's adventure? well i saw the shrink. he was friendly and professional, didn't dig any deeper than was nescessarry and obligingly gave me a month's perscription for zoloft. i babbled and lost my words and confused even myself - how verry moi...  one salient point that has come to me and i believe to be the crux of my dilema is such: exactly how many of my neuroses are traceable to some real definable medical or chemical imbalance in my brain and what can be written off as simple (???) charecter flaws? i'm guessing there's alot of grey area there.  love peace and chicken grease

      i can't remember the last time i drank so heartily. of course, following that i was pretty sure i was going to barff pretty heartily too but actually, aside from the rushing and booming in my head i'm remarkably allright.  such a good time to be had, going out with friends to places like the roost. actually, mostly specifically to the roost. it just has this atmosphere where even i feel comfortable. of course the gents (tony and bryce) were anything but... they went though. and good for them.  my husband, on the other hand, saw fit to embarass the hell out of me by making some typical  homophobic comments. by typical though, i mean to society at large. as for him i've not known him to be such a big jerk-face before. but shit, i've never been so ashamed of him in my life. and bryce and danielle just sat there, jaws scraping the table.  did i hear him right? did he actually say he'd go in there with a grenade launcher? did he actually say he'd be waiting outside to beat people up? and did he actually excuse his behaviour  by saying that he had said no three times and then wanted to change the subject? he did. disgusting.  part of what frustrates me in such a big way is that he is, in a lot of ways, an idiot. he's been so indoctrinated into this 'truth' that he can hardly see anything else. but then sometimes i think it's not that, that the rest of his family doesn't suffer with things like this so he may just be a big stupid jerk and, that being the case, what the hell have i done here?  ahem, as i was saying, because he doesn't get what i throw at him, he just argues back with no real input from the logic center of his brain. nothing i say has yet been able to penetrate this sort of cumulative shield he has of arrogance, ignorance and impatience.  i love him, i suppose. but there are more and more times when i sure don't like him verra much.  i need to go for a smoke. i suppose you'll be here when i get back?   good on ya! cheers

      so my term is finally over, said term having accounted for the gap in this here blog.  well i came out allright, i suppose. no As but two A-, varrious grades of B and a lone dissenting D (ugh!) i seem to think a bit more of myself than i acctually should; i thought this program would be a cakewalk. cakewalks don't end in D.  but i'm through so all i can do is perhaps devote some sort of marginal effort to my second term in the hopes that it will improve.  in other news, my goddamned cyst reared (tee hee) it's prurulent head again this week. 3 in 8 months means that i'm now looking forward to having the whole damned thing excised. won't that make me the popular girl!! maybe they can take an extra 20 lbs off my ass, you know while i'm there. i'm sure our publicly-funded system has plenty of free time for just such procedures!  flipped out on my husband again today. we got a registered letter from the insurance company saying that our insurance would be cut off 04 jan. i had a right fit over it and called danielle (from paul's cell, our land-line having been disconected as promised). well she talked to the company and got back to us and as long as we make the payment plus the next month's payment plus the nsf fee and it's certified or something of that nature we should be fine. thing is, we looked up paul's banking history and lo and behold, it shows not one but two withdrawls for that very date. i think the insurance company just got confused somehow and actually it appears that their error ended up causing my nervous break-dance.  either way, i explained to paul that i really can't handle shit like this anymore. i really need to have some kind of stability and balance and security in my life. frivolous things i know but whatcha gonna do? i is what i is.  as always he forgives me. he doesn't say as much but he treats me as though he has benevolently decided to extend himself to cover my shortcommings. it makes me cringe in a way but on the other hand, it's a damn sight easier than trying to reason it out with him.  he's at work now, he got his eval this afternoon and i'm hoping with all my heart that it went really well for him. he's lasted out just over six months so i think he deserves this. i only hope that he's behaving appropriately at work. sometimes i think his adult self goes into a coma whenever i'm arround which is one thing, but i worry that it's never coming back too.   i suppose i should go play more neopets games or write out my flashcards for next term or something. i feel really unproductive durring catharsis.  g'bi

      so today i learned some hard stuff.  a) my anxiety is merely confused and repressed anger b) my husband is a petulant child who will never grow up so long as i keep treating him as such. c) my goal right now needs to be finishing school, no matter what the cost d) if i keep going the way i am i'll never go anywhere  i think the bit about my husband gets the award for 'thing that i'm most aware of but least willing to deal with'   i saw my counsellor today and she really put the screws to this whole notion i have of taking care of him as though he is a child. she explained to me that from my perception (what i had told her) my husband was a child, taking a free ride, not worrying about the consequences and not respecting me or taking me serriously. of course i've known that for quite some time, but still... it's easier to think that there's something i can fix in him.   but that's not how it's gonna be. no, she told me that if i continue to try and fix him i'll just ignore my own needs and neither of us will ever get out of the vicious circle. aside from which, i'm this simmering, seething ball of resentment and letting him treat me the way he does only adds fuel to my fire.  which ties in nicely with the anxiousness, actually. since the more i burn, the less i can actually release. lacking an appropriate anger outlet, i convert anger into anxiety/panic/stress, call it what you will, it's all produced right here, in my brain.  which raises some more interesting questions concerning what else might be going on or not in my life. the eating thing? yeah that has absolutely got to stop. i can hardly stand the sight of myself anymore, even though i have no idea what i look like. wonder if that's normal. i see a picture of myself and i feel like a stranger, grotesque, phony, unstopable.  so i got the atkins books, two of em, should be enough to get me started. at least then i won't have food as a crutch to lean on when i don't feel like coping in any sort of healthy manner. too, i think it will help me to feel in control of myself and that, i'm sure, will go a long way towards making me feel more... alive.  next up... REALITY: is it really real?

       truely, i couldn't be more thrilled with myself.&nbsp; apparently i did so well on the interview that melissa decided to offer me a full time position&nbsp; instead of a casual one!!! this is unreal, i thought it would be at least a year before i pulled of this mystical feat but apparently i'm all that.    &nbsp;  irony of ironies though, of course telus got back to me today.&nbsp; i would have almost taken the position too, if i had been awake when the call came.&nbsp; i'm glad at the way things ended up working out though.    &nbsp;  ella enchanted is a lovely, sunny, feel good bit of fluff - can't go wrong with realistic ogre buttcracks.     &nbsp;  so much to do!!

       so today i'm thinking about all the people who have fallen out of my life in the past however long.&nbsp; so many people that i've dismissed but maybe that wasn't it. maybe they've passed me by.&nbsp; not all of them i suppose.&nbsp; and maybe the more telling thing is the people who have stayed arround.&nbsp; it can't be v. easy putting up with me when i get in high dudgeon, which isn't rare. either way, i've decided to compose a list. heeeeeeeeeeeeerreee we go, no. 10     &nbsp;   the posse: matt, darnell, vaness, mena    remaining: mena     &nbsp;   tim's days:&nbsp; jodi, cathleener    remaining: none     &nbsp;   school days:&nbsp; mena,&nbsp; jessie,&nbsp; shanda, susan, natalie, katherine    remaining: mena     &nbsp;   ipsos people:&nbsp; angela and&nbsp;sandy, daniel, tabitha, mo, christine, ronnie... too many to count    remaining: well rachelle got custody of sandy and angela and the rest, idk     &nbsp;   others: old boyfriends, old work friends, old school friends, just fell out of touch     &nbsp;   well this has been a pretty good exercise in self-depressive introspection.&nbsp; i think i'll stop now     &nbsp;   buh-bye     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       never did finish that last post... my legions of loyal fans will just have to figgure it out on their own. my public does so much appreciate a good mystery.   aaaaaaannnnyyyywhoooo... this have been quite busy this past week.&nbsp; had a had a bunch of interviews, i think both the alex and telus will end up calling me back - i'm just cocky that way.&nbsp; dunno what i should do though. i mean the unit clerk thing is what i set myself up for with my schooling but the sticky wicket will be the hours.&nbsp; on the other hand, telus pays a little less and is not what i dreamed of anyway but the hours are more reliable.&nbsp; we shall see.     &nbsp;  either way, i think i shall hang on to this temping thing, i'm really enjoying it.&nbsp; i recognize that the company i'm currently working for is by no means typical but i still like the idea of being in and out like that.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  but no matter what happens the wardrobe is going to need a little bit of jazz.&nbsp; i need clothes that fit, that are comfortable, and that look presentable.&nbsp; if i were to be perfectly honest, i would say all i really need to do is iron more often.&nbsp; but i'm not.&nbsp; i'm full of shit.&nbsp; ergo, i need more clothes.    &nbsp;   i think that i have not much else to say for now.

       Wow. Yesterday was some day.    &nbsp;  Started off with an interview and testing thing at Telus.&nbsp; That ran me three hours and I feel reasonable confident in what i put forward, other than that I failed to complete the French segment of the program but after three hours of testing I just don't think I was running on on all 8 cylinders.&nbsp; So whatever, this part of my day ends before noon.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Then Paul picks me up and i decided that I would deserve a treat for doing so well.&nbsp; I thought I McDonald's sundae would be nice but no, he wants a whole meal.&nbsp; And he figures he'll pay but what he doesn't realize is that the insurance is due and his account is NSF - he feels that trying the same card twice may change this but it doesn't. So I pay - I have no choice, the food is on the tray in front of us.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  And just when the money situation is so dark we're tossing arround ideas for who we could go live with, his final cheque from his old job appears like mannah from the postman.&nbsp; and what's more it's close to 500$ more than I thought he'd be getting. So it looks like our asses are pulled out of the fire one more time.&nbsp;   &nbsp; Flash forward to the p.m. for the longstanding Traditional Friday Night Gathering.&nbsp; Sky's parents are out of town on a bike tour and Danielle would like for us all to avail ourselves of their pool.&nbsp; This is fine with Sky and everyone else even though I am a little sketchy a) about being in a bathing suit and b) about the whole snarky colon thing.&nbsp; So I concede but not to the swimming.&nbsp; I figgured I'd just dip my toes in.&nbsp; After much tribulation, we arrive at the site over half an hour late and thank god Danielle has&nbsp;only just&nbsp;arrived. &nbsp; To tell the god's-honest, I'm more than a little tired of the typing right now.&nbsp; I really hope I remember to come back here and finish this post cause this is one of those nights that you really want to remember. &nbsp;    Splish splash

      Visualization  it's a very important part of things, isn't it? (write that down, timmy.)  I can visualize myself as a non-smoker, I can visualize myself at a healthy weight, I can visualize myself happy and fulfilled.  All of those things help me make it through the day but none of which, all by its onesie, has the power to change anything. Id est, thinking healthy isn't enough; concrete physical changes need to occur.  But i think the more a person's thoughts return to a specified ideal, the more likely it is that they will muster up the juice to take the requisite steps.  Which means that probably all my little daydreams about how I think things should be will help me to eventually achieve those things.  The temptation is entirely too strong to just let it slide and figure that it will come out in the wash.  You know what keeds? It WON'T come out in the wash, not without some elbow grease anyway.  And although I am babbling and making verra little sense, even unto myself, I can 't  help but feel this is progress.  Big interview comming up on Friday.  Hope my mind/body cooperate.  I don't think I should have too many issues but you never can tell right? Okay, that's bullshit.  In my heart of hearts I truely believe that I will sail through all the little tests they've got with flying colours and get a 30, 000$/yr job and be well liked and respected by all for my professionalism and sparkling wit.  This, of course, is not bloody likely but my inside voices don't much care for the petty details.  Paul had his testing and interview today.  He seems cautiously optimistic.  Tough to tell though; we aren't the most frank of couples, though work is continually in progress.  Funny thing about that... I keep wanting him to 'open up', 'share his feelings'.  Him, not so much.  He doesn't like to talk about stuff like this so he either clams up all together or gets insanely defensive.  I gotta say it really makes me mental when he flips over my questions, sentiments or  *gasp!* criticism back on to me.  In the history of recorded time has there ever been a man who died from giving a straight answer?!?!?!  From what I can tell there must have been a great many and they must have suffered unspeakably horrible deaths to have scared the rest of the lot away from it.  love, peace and chicken grease

      well well well...  so paul's first day at his new job didn't go quite as well as planned.  he slept all day sunday then was up all night monday, despite my repeated nagging.  he got to work on time but apparently it al went downhill from there.  he found the work hard on him physically and no doubt he was pretty exhausted as well and he ended up shooting himself though the finger with a nail gun. following this he puked several times and blacked out.  he was home shortly after 1:00.  so now we're both unemployed and up the creek as it were.    of course there was discussion about it tonight and of course when he came home i cried.  i patched him up as best i could but all i could think was "this is your fault" which isn't verra helpfull.    i'm trying pretty hard not to accuse him and not to flip out all together and just let go of my tenuous grip but it ain't easy.  i like to believe that one day things will be better, maybe even good but that day is not today.  oh yes, and my colon apparently hates me again.  i just don't know what i'm going to do .

      today we saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Lovely film but quite a bit different than what I had remembered from the book.  V.interesting to see the developping personalities of our young heroes though, to me it's played out much more vividly on film.  Which is not to say that it is in any way lacking in the books, it's just a lot more subtle.    and on the crap side of the coin, my husband, who quit his job yesterday to take a new job in construction, just found out that the new job in construction isn't the sure bet it initially appeared to be.  not only has the guy hedged on giving him an accurate wage (he told me 10-12 but he wrote down 8-12) but now he's telling paul that he may have overhired and what with the rains and all... well fuck.  where would that leave us?!?!? i know i'm still not working yet.  i was really hoping to hear back from the hospital today but i guess not so tomorrow it's no more bullshit.  no more waiting arround for mannah from heaven. it's time to go full bore on the resumee warpath.  submit submit submit to every place who'll take one.  as many as i can online then bat clean up by doing cold calls in the am and seeing what I can't see from there.    the sad reality of our situation is we have exhausted not only our reserves but those of our familes as well.  our government is no help whatsoever.  apparently since i just went to school they're not worried and despite the fact that paul is only bringing in somewhere in the 950$/mo range (well below the poverty line) we're apparently too rich for social assistance.  i can't collect EI because i haven't made 700 hours since my last claim and paul may or may not be able to but even if he can that's only 55% of the 950 he was making before and will not take effect for two weeks or possibly even three.  what a fuckaroo...

      well colour me enlightened.  looking at the pictures that other people have collected in shoeboxes and what have you, i notice that I'm not there.  I never was there and I don't know these people.  Who are they?  They look like my family but they can't be.  They don't know me and I don't know them.  Do I want to know them?  Sometimes but not always.  Sometimes I want them to know me.  But mostly I just want everyone to go away and let me live in my little brown box under a tree.    I am so full of shit.  I don't want that at all but (3 guesses keeds...) I'm scared.  What if they did know me and didn't like me?  What if they liked me and I did something retarded to fuck it up?  What if what if what if?  And SO WHAT if??? What could I possibly have to lose?   Yeah, well that's easy for you to say but you're not me.   Or am I?   Ever get the feeling like you're living in a Stephen King book and all of a sudden you're Johnny Depp burning down your own house?   Me too.  Allllllll the time.   Well not always Johnny Depp but always not me.  Someone else who lives in my skin and doesn't know their way arround so well.  It's not pretty, itellyouwut.
