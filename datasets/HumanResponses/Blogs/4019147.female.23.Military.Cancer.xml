       urlLink       Also from the Red corner, Krisso, Also Known as The Nerd Next Door. Hailing from Byron bay this dood certainly does know how to get pissed. As an official member of TEAM P.I.S.S he more than deserves a place right here at home with fellow&nbsp;drunken idiots (most of which he will probably never meet)

       urlLink      Aliera     urlLink    And in the red corner.......... Mezzabee, aka Aliera. In her spare time she likes sleeping, drinking and listening to farking cool music. This weeks new picks are the new StaticX cd, and Butterfingers. Yay for Birthday Treats. Enjoys: Getting really drunk and making a complete dick of herself, and friends. Talking lots, bagging out pretty much anything that she can turn into a&nbsp;joke, because she really is, herself, quite a joke. She is also the mastermind behind the now infamous Goonordial. (Goon + Cordial)Shes the one at a party who always has a camera.&nbsp;Uh-Oh Sgbhetti'O.

       urlLink      Also emerging from the Blue corner, Jordana. One of the few dood chicks in the crew.     In her spare time she enjoys bringing everybody together for baked dinners, and goon.     She is the mother duck in the group who keeps us all under control. We do as Jordy says.     Jordy tells it like it is.... *fart*... *fart*... [erruption of giggles and laughter] "um, I think I need to do a Poo"     All in all, Jordy is a fucking cool chick, who has everyones respect.

       urlLink      Standing in the Blue corner also, Nathan, also Known as just simply Nate.     Nate is simply very Rock. He enjoys playing guitar but also convincing people he's shit at it. Has a habit of loosing items of fair importance such as ID, house Keys etc.     Nate is a total Dood, who could probably be mistaken as a bum, especially if seen walking alongside Trav.     He&nbsp;has a knack for&nbsp;finding wicked&nbsp;stuff at Vinnies.     And like the rest of us enjoys the odd beverage of the alcoholic variety.&nbsp;    urlLink

       urlLink      Belonging to the Red corner,   and also residing in Byron bay,&nbsp; recently&nbsp;returned from&nbsp;Canada (jet lagged as seen in pic)is Andrew, known as a whole catalouge of nick names But to me he's always gonna be Shrek (picture's coming soon)     Also an official member of TEAM P.I.S.S knows like all of us the art of getting hammered. He learnt from some of the best also for those that know of them (his Dad Chris, Shep and Billy)     Famous for being the guy in the singlet and pluggers, but not being a bogan and having a remarkable resemblence to Ryan Dunn form Jackass...       &nbsp;

       urlLink   &nbsp;  &nbsp; urlLink     Ok, Hailing technically from the Red corner, as He is&nbsp;origionally from Aliera's crew, I think&nbsp;I will give him a corner of his own for his side of the extended family of post-teen misfits. So he can&nbsp;have the Black corner, as you'll all agree is an appropriate choice of colour.      Pete, also Known online as Vampyr Boy  &nbsp;   is the newest addition to the gang.      He enjoys listening to all varieties of metal and hard rock, .  urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/vampyrboy/ &nbsp;8)       In his spare time he Jamms with different people and their instruments, adding the much needed vocal element to the common garage band. Just the week he has joined forces with Ben, Nathan and Daniel. The results of which I'm yet to witness.        drinking is also His game... all varieties except red wine I believe...

       urlLink       The captain of the Blue corner,&nbsp;And probably the inspiration behind the need for this site,&nbsp; Captain Obvious, previously from the Hammertime files. Benjamin is the clever funny guy. The one to make EVERYONE laugh. Ben enjoys getting rather intoxicated, making wise cracks, playing bass, and stating the obvious. Suffers from violent hangovers, and I believe dubbed himself once as Captain vOmit....&nbsp; Times have since changed with age I believe...    urlLink http://random.y11.net

       urlLink       recently introduced by Peetor, is Daniel, But since the evening of Introduction, will always be known as Dogwater boy. Not much is known of this lad, except that he will do almost anything for $7 and 3 VB tinnies, Including drinking Dogade. (fizzy meat flavoured drink for dogs)      He is another drummer with a kickarse makeshift double kit. (sorry, I dont know drumming jargon)      We are likely to see more of this young stuntman in the future im sure.        &nbsp;
