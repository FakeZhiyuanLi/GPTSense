      Tonight is supposed to be Anna's orgasm night. However she only gets one tonight and it's going to be over quick. Before she does though, she's going to get something else that she has had coming for a very long time. A special punishment.  I never had any desire to punish Anna over Erik like she thought I had done the day before I told her I knew. It never entered my mind. In fact, I have as of yet to punish her over a matter of heartfelt conviction until tonight. I've punished her for odd and end things, but tonight is special. Tonight Anna gets punished for something she truly deserves. How she talks about herself.  For Years she has refused to hear me when I have told her how beautiful and lovely she is. All she has ever wanted to do is have that selfish little pity party with her Cosmo magazine and comparing herself to those wretched cosmo models. Holding herself to not only an unreasonable standard, but rejecting the very standard I chose her for.  Anna has never understood. But tonight, we will begin to show her the way. Tonight, it's 10 hairbrush strokes followed by 200 sentences on the board. I regret it's only 10. In fact, I wish it was the Pain Stick instead of the brush (it WILL be next time!) But even if it was 1000 strokes, it wouldn't be enough to show her how much she has hurt herself and me with her insistent self downtrodden talk all this time. Time and again she has broken my heart with that crap. I'll be warming her up over a small matter of the kitchen sink. And after...She will probably need to stand up the rest of the night.  She's getting off easy. After it's over, all is forgiven and I'll hold her close and hopefully watch a new self esteem blossom from the tears and ashes. Submissive tend to feel well loved when they are disciplined with corporal punishment for something they know is wrong. Tonight, Anna will feel very loved indeed.

      I posted about last Friday the 21st and backdated it so it is further down the page, if you want to read about it.  I'm going to get Saturday and Sunday up tonight and then post about this weekend in one post and hopefully stay up to date after that, no more backdating.    My Doms, if I leave out any details or if you want to post your perspective on an event, please do.  I'd love to hear your side of things.  I know this is "my" little project, but I love it when you two contribute.

      Thursday I was very tired and very sore all over, I think I mentioned that in the previous post.  I warned Dom that I was planning to claim "immunity" for the day.  He gave me a dog tag to wear when I needed a break.  Either just some space or if I make a genuine mistake that is punishable but I dont think I can handle the punishment.  When he gave it to me and told me what it meant I was very grateful because I didn't think I would be able to express those needs.  But like I told him last night, he has turned on my spigot and I can't seem to keep from telling him what I want or what I need or answering his questions honestly.  I told him he would probably end up sorry of it too.  I've already told him something I didn't really intend to, a little snippet of a fantasy.  More like just something I thought would be intensely hot.  He drove me to work, a special treat because the employee parking lots are a fair walking distance to the building.  When he picked me up after work and took me home I put on the dog tag even though I had told him what I needed.  He had supper ready so we ate and watched a movie together.  I did some web surfing while he watched the rest of the movie and after the movie he had a special treat for me.  He had bought some arnica gel to rub on my bruises and sore muscles.  He wound up covering most of my body, getting both.  Then he brushed my hair for me.  I love to have my hair brushed and would have purred if I could have.  He spent quite a while brushing my hair and then we cuddled and talked some.    After we got back up I got online and spoke with Erik briefly but he had a date so I didn't get to talk to him long.  I got in bed at a reasonable hour for a change, about 11.  We cuddled some more and I drifted to sleep in Dom's arms.  Very nice.  Today was truly a day off, unlike Sunday and Monday's attempts.  I didn't even talk to Erik at work.  But that was kind of a have to thing, I have spent so much time totally focused on my new life that I haven't been getting my work done and I was afraid of getting in trouble.  By the end of the day I felt really refreshed and was looking forward to getting back to submitting.  Unfortunately, Dom is going to be out of town for the weekend.  I'm sure Erik can keep me busy though.

      I had been looking forward to this for days.  I'm supposed to keep this updated with my exploits but I'm a lazy so and so, I've got a lot of catching up to do to get it up to date and I'm going to do something I hope I don't get in trouble for.  I'm going to copy most of an email I sent to Erik describing the days events.  With a little editing of course.  Orgasm Day almost started at midnight, but we were both pretty wrung out from Tuesday evening's events, in spite of the nap we took.  So we just went to bed.  We started something but it wasn't working and I told him I'd just as soon wait until in the morning.   He asked me to call in for Wednesday Tuesday night late and at first I told him I couldn't, that I had too much to do including a class to teach.  But I could tell he really wanted me to and after I thought about it I decided I could skip one day.  And I only had one person signed up for the class so it wasn't like I was going to be inconviencing a bunch of people.  So when I woke up Wed. morning I called and just said I had some personal things I had to take care of and apologized for such short notice.  I did my 3 minutes for Erik (don't know if I've mentioned it, but one of my daily tasks is to spend 3 minutes every morning before work teasing myself and thinking about Erik.  But I'm normally not allowed to come.) but didn't come because at that point I hadn't got his message saying I could.     I took a shower and when I came out hubby handed me a vibrating egg and told me to go for it.  I had a couple of nice orgasms.  We got dressed and went to the adult bookstore and found a replacement for the egg, a gag, a dolphin vibe, 2 kinds of lube and another desensitizing one, a bumper sticker that says Naughty Girl for me and probably something else I'm not thinking of.  We stopped at a tack store on the way back to town but couldn't find any nice collars there.  He took me to Burger King for lunch because we were both ready to get home.  But we had to stop at walmart first.  Just got some misc. junk and picked out a collar for me.  We split up to get done faster and I had trouble finding some of my things because the store has been remodeled and stuff has been moved.  So he was waiting for me when I went to pets to meet him.   When we got home he had me get on the massage table to assume my position.  He spanked me for making him wait even though it wasn't entirely my fault.  We retired to the bedroom for a little sex and I had two very long, very hard orgasms with him fucking me and me using one of my new toys.  These were much better than the ones I had that morning.   After that we both just did our own thing for a while until it was time for Enterprise which we watched together.  After Enterprise he had me kneel in front of him.  He opened a bottle of pink champagne and we shared one glass.  Then he told me he wanted me to do something for him, something submissive.  He poured half the remaining champagne into a bowl and put it in the floor in front of me and told me to have another drink.  It was very hard to make myself, but I bent over and drank from the bowl.  I think I got as much on my nose as I did in my mouth, but I made the effort.     After that I don't remember how exactly it came up, but I made some comment about a champagne enema.  He offered it but I said I'd rather drink the champagne.  So he went and got the other bottle of wine he bought that afternoon and used it to give me an enema.  He gave it to me right in the living room which felt weird and it didn't take very long at all before I started feeling the effects of the wine.  I got very giggly.  I usually get either a little more talkative or affectionate, not silly.  When I said I needed to go he made me crawl to the bathroom and then told me not to let it go until he said I could.  He made me hold it for a couple more minutes before he said I could go and he left the room when I asked him to.   After that he took me to the bedroom and used his new favorite toy, a very slim wand vibrating egg.  He was touching it right on my clit and it made me sob every time he touched me there.  I don't usually use such direct stimulation.  It felt like a shock and I came for him.  He tried to get me to come again but I couldn't.  When he turned it off I could still feel myself vibrating.   After I got off the computer from talking with Erik I told him I wanted him to fuck my ass and that I could come after he did, even if it was after midnight.  So he got me ready pretty quick using the desensitizing stuff we got.  I asked him to spit in me, like Erik had told me to.  He did it several times and I really didn't like it, it felt really nasty.  When I was loosened up I sat down on him, facing him.  He slid right in with little problem but I couldn't move very well.  My legs were (and still are) very tired and sore from all the use they've had the last few days.  We wound up having to turn me over with him behind me.  I asked if I could come before he did so I could come with him still fucking me and he let me.  That orgasm was pretty intense and very long.  He says I had 2 separate ones, I disagree.  That brought my total for the day to either 8 or 9 depending on how you count that last one.  He told me I didn't ask for 2 of them for the day, but I don't remember not asking.  He didn't say what or if he was going to do about it.   I had a really good day, but the next day I was tired because it was 1 before I got to sleep.  And sore all over.  My breasts are sore.  My wrists and arms from handcuffs and supporting myself so much.  My abs from all the sex and orgasms.  My legs from the squats monday and all the other activity.  And my knees are quite sore.    I was informed while chatting with Erik that I'm not going to be allowed to come until Memorial Day.  Sounds like I'll be having an extra special holiday.

      You know what I said about not being able to wait to see what Dom had planned for me?  It didn't exactly work out that way.  I came home, greeted him briefly and was told to go in the bedroom.  He had a surprise for me, a poster of my rules and punishments for breaking them.  A poster.  Not a sheet of notebook paper.  A poster.  I paniced.  Not because there was that much new, there were a couple new things.  Not even because of the punishments being spelled out, although some were pretty harsh.  I just saw the size of the list and felt smothered.    Dom asked me why, made me think about it.  It's been so much easier to think clearly and answer honestly the last few days.  So I thought about it.  And decided I was afraid of resenting the rules when I didn't feel submissive.  Like I didn't feel submissive last night.  And then I told him I needed him to make me submit more.  I know, I know.  Make up my mind, right?  I'm still very confused.  Unsure of what I want or need.  A little scared.  And still just a tad haunted by our last efforts at D/s when I felt like I let him down.  So he informs me he is going to punish me for that guilt.  To help me let it go.  All he would say was he was going to punish me so I  felt  punished.  And wouldn't tell me what he was going to do.  Then he made me sit and watch the movie I rented and stew about what was coming.  I managed to work up a good head of fear by the time the movie was over.  He bound my breasts and tied them over my head to the power rack in the gym.  Then made a crotch rope, just for stimulation I think because I don't think that was attached and cuffed my hands behind my back.  He used this little leather slapper on my breasts.  Very sting-y.  And then he used a small rubber flogger.  And the riding crop some.  Then he put clothes pins on my nipples and used the flogger a little more.  I was in tears, but not letting go of much at this point.  He took me down and had me stretch out on the massage table and cuffed my hands in front of me.  He talked to me for several minutes and I started crying again, blurting out some junk from my past.  Just feelings, how I felt about my relationship with my mom and how it made me feel.  And that I didn't want to be her.  He told me I was on my way to being like her.  He couldn't have said anything more painful.  A little more talk and he stood up and moved behind me.  He used the crop on my ass and in no time (it seemed) I was sobbing hard.  At one point I was sobbing so hard I couldn't feel the crop.  I mean, I could, I could feel it touching me, but it didn't hurt.  All my focus was inward.  I've never experienced that before, not even with the hairbrushing.  I did feel punished when it was over.  And I felt clean.  Later when we were in bed cuddling I told him it was gross, but I felt like a big nasty wound that was very infected.  And when he punished me, it was like draining the wound.  Painful but necessary and much better afterwards.  He told me that was how it was supposed to feel, that I was doing just right.  And that eventually, after we worked out a lot of my fears and resentments and other poisons, I would still crave the punishments and still feel the release but for it's own sake.  I guess I probably will, as much as I am looking forward to the next one already.

      You can sense it when you talk to Precious now.  She has taken to the role of sub pain slut with the same ferver that someone that converted religions has.  In many ways it is the same.  Her body is the temple.  The uses that it is put to, religious services.  The doms, pastors that guide their flock to enlightenment.  The pain, the bondage, the sex, all form of worship that put her mind in the place she needs to seek enlightenment.    I have sacramental wine for you Precious.  Today is her first Orgasm day.  She has been in denial for 5 days now.  I hope she uses her time wisely, and apreciates quality over quanity.  Orgasm day ends at midnight.  I do belive it will be at least another week before she gets to have another.

      Just a quick post this morning.  Last night was a "vanilla" night for us.  Even so, I was still expected to provide a proper greeting for my Dom.  While waiting for him to come home I worked out.  I was almost finished when he got there and he told me to go ahead and finish before greeting him.  For his greeting he wanted me to assume the position.  So I stripped off quickly and kneeled in front of him with my back to him, bent over at the waist and put my forehead on my hands which were on the floor.  This position gets me in a very submissive mindset very fast, it is so open and vulnerable and since he is behind me I can't see what he is doing.  I can feel his eyes touching me and am nearly breathless, waiting for his physical touch.  Last night he teased the tight little rosebud of my ass with his tongue.  I love and hate this.  I love the sensation but hate that I love it, it feels so dirty.  This time though, I just loved it.    When he finished teasing me we showered together, washing each other's hair.  Then we tried a trick I had read about, I put a couple of Altoids in my mouth and sucked his cock.  He said it felt tingly, but didn't seem terribly impressed.  He was impressed with my oral skills and praised me for them.  I've been practicing a lot lately.  I put on my red lace teddy, per Erik's instructions.  I blogged a little while I ate and my Dom watched a little t.v.  When we got done eating we retired to the bedroom for a massage and some lovemaking.  Not fucking, lovemaking.  He brushed my hair for me too.  I really love that, it feels so good anyway, but when he did it I felt spoiled and pampered and very loved.  The lovemaking was sweet, got a little more intense than he intended I think.  I asked to be made love to with him on top, makes me feel very safe and loved.  And a little submissive.  This morning I woke up about 5 and had to use the bathroom.  I thought to myself, I really hope he keeps his fingers to himself this morning, I am not in the mood.  Almost 2 hours later, right before my alarm was set to go off, he started petting my bottom.  Rubbing his finger between my cheeks.  When the tip of his finger started prodding my hole I just instinctively relaxed it and he slid right in.  I didn't realize I was moaning so, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  He stopped too soon, leaving me wanting more.  I was very wet and my 3 minutes teasing myself for Erik went by entirely too quickly.    I left for work only a little horny.  But thinking about it again and chatting with Erik has left me wet and aching, feeling submissive.  I can't wait for the work day to be over, to go home and strip naked and see what my Dom has planned for me.  Even knowing I can't have an orgasm until tomorrow, I'm squirmy with anticipation.

      I felt good driving to work. I felt a little bad for tormenting and using Anna so last night. But after waking her up by fingering her asshole, and fucking her mind while she did the required playing with herself without orgasm that Erik has her do each morning, and listning to her moan like a whore, I felt good. Good and vicious.  I stopped by a horse and tackle store on my way to work to look for somehitng nice to give to Anna. I know as well as Erik that after several days of teasing and our demanded chastity of her, she's ripe for pleasure. She's almost to the place that she will do anything, try anything, endure anything, to achieve that permission to orgasm.  While I was browsing a young guy walked up and asked if he could help me find something. I was in my mode, dark and firm and I flatly told him "No thank you." Now I don't know if he was suspicious of me being a shoplifter, or a pervert, but he had to push and find out so he asked me "Are you looking for somehting for a horse?" Never looking back at him I replied in a firm and confidnet tone, "No." immediately he went away....  But I noticed someone else in my periferal vision, at the opposite endcap where the dog food is. I turned my head to find an older, well seasoned looking woman staring at me. She had on the typical white trash cut offs and T shirts that prevail here and looked like an old shoe from too much suntanning. That and the fact she was a stick gave me no cause for a second glance.  I finished and moved on to leave. I bought a soda with this woman in line behind me, then following me out into the parking lot. I could feel her staring so I tured to face her with one of my patented "hard looks", expecting to see her looking at me like I was a freak (I get that a lot, it's a look I foster). Instead, to my surprise I find her with this look that says something closer to "Please take me with you."  Interesting. And novel.

      I've been roused from my slumber to review the last few days, and the laid plans for the future. These are exciting times.  Erik has laid down an opening volley of rules on Anna. Rules designed to touch every aspect of her life with the grace of domination. This is what I anticipated waiting on.  In our situation, Erik makes the ideal administrator, I make the ideal enforcer. It would be all too easy to overburden our little toy with strict regiments of rules and requirements. In that, I have kept daily "expected" tasks to a minimum, and designed them with the end of allowing Anna to express her submission, or her rebellion, at her whim.  She is required to greet me properly when we gather for the day. She is required to obey the order to "Assume the Position" and today I will teach her the order to "Remember Your Place." Beyond that are smaller rules that she can use as forms of open communication.  Erik provides solid ground on which to rest her submissive Yin. My job, in order to compliment, rather than confuse and overwhelm, her is to be fluid.  Like hot magma, to flow fast and hard into the gaps, cracks and crevices of Anna. To ensure Anna's focus stays where it should, and that her thinking remains correct.  I'm not eager to set up too structured a lifestyle with her. I have far too many ideas and experiments to try on her mind and body before I limit what I do to her by too many sets of rules.

      Since both of my Doms have now weighed in I guess I will take a turn.  I'm going to go back and make posts for every day since this started which will go back to Wednesday.  For simplicities sake I will back date them with the appropriate date.  That will keep from making one big post that would be hard to read.  So I guess you should read those first for this to make a lot of sense.  I'll try to get those up as quickly as possible.  Today was supposed to be a day off for me.  Mostly because it has been so intense and all consuming from the beginning that I've barely had time to catch a breath.  But like the naughty sub I am, I couldn't leave well enough alone.  This morning before I was even out of bed I confessed that I was curious how a spanking on my still sore and very bruised ass would feel.  After making me ask for it (still something hard for me) Eben indulged me.  And just in case it's not obvious, Eben is my husband.  (Really sweetheart?  Eben?)  What I found was that it got very intense very quickly and I cried uncle pretty soon.  Eben had to leave shortly after to go work a few hours.  My plan was to shower and go find a couple of movies to lounge with for the day.  Instead I got this blog set up and sent invites to my Doms.  And sent Erik a nasty picture from last nights festivities that he instigated.  He replied back and told me a day of rest sounded like a good idea to him too.  Only he suggested a bath instead of a shower.  Before I could do a shower or bath Eben called to check on me.  And once again, I had to push.  And bring up some insecurities.  He didn't say a whole lot about what I brought up, other than to reassure me.  Then the cruel man told me to play with myself and answer some questions.  What's cruel about that?  I'm not allowed to have an orgasm until Wednesday.  And after last night's mistake I certainly want to obey that order.  When he finally let me stop I was in tears of frustration so he stayed on the phone with me a few minutes more until I was ready to get in the shower.  Since Erik told me to take a bath I ran one and soaked for a few minutes.  That felt really good on all my sore muscles.  (Of course, I had to stand up to wash my hair anyway so I got both bath and shower)  It was mid-afternoon by this time and I knew I had to run to get my errands done and be back before Eben.  I found a couple of movies and got a pizza for us.  He called shortly after I got back home and told me to read my email and do what it said.  Basically he called bullshit on my insecurities from this morning.  And said if that was true, I was going to be punished for not being trusting enough.  Well, after I thought about it I realized he was probably right and I did deserve punishment.  But I certainly dreaded it.  I'm still sore and bruised all over.  I pleaded my case after he got home and I had greeted him properly.  He decided since he was at least half right I got the punishment.  A few stinging slaps on my poor abused pussy and tender nipples later and all was forgiven.  Then he had to tease me again by using my sore pussy to get himself off.  But I didn't get to come.  I had to really concentrate on not coming and I confess I was in a bratty mood afterwards.  I'm lucky he was in such a good mood from his own orgasm, I only got scolded for it this time.  We watched a movie together and now I'm spending some time online.  I have to work tomorrow, but tomorrow evening is my makeup free time.  If I don't push again.

      The mind is an amazing tool and an even more incredible weapon. We see in ourselves and in others exactly what we expect to see. Worse, we often close doors and dismiss thoughts, ideas, and passions that have the capacity to make us very happy. We can be unhappy, but because we will not allow ourselves to see the full of our potentials, because we have given ourselves to doubt, or to be tainted by the poor judgments or decisions of others, we cannot make ourselves happy again.  These are the principles of the way (Tao) and the Tsing. They can make us, or they can damn us.   Erik has shown Anna the way. And she is happier than she has ever been. Even in fits of frustration at the invisible bonds we have put on her. I can see the light in her eyes that at long last she has found the path meant for her.  The way of some is to lead, the way of some is to conquer. For the balance of tsing to be complete there must be those meant to submit. She still yet struggles with that. But she is beginning to see the sadness and futility of refusing to hear the call inside of her.  In only a few days Anna has advanced from barely being self aware of her desires to being immersed at a depth and level that has surprised us both. Years of frustration grinding her soul spurs her now to passions beyond her wildest expectations. She is wild and insatiable, yet as fragile as a flower. She fears that the velocity and intensity of her pleasures means that her experience will be short lived. Almost child like, she huddles fearing a monster (tsing) in the dark will come and snatch away her newfound way. It is amazing to see the pendulum swing from ravenous appetite to concerns of suffocation and loss of freedom. The concerns are rooted in insecurity, and a delicate pact of trust who's weight has yet to be fully tested.  It will indeed be an interesting journey.

      We exchanged so many emails back and forth after she noticed my blog.   Emails where she was in control, and emails where she was not.  The reaction to the ones where she was not opened a window that let me know her.  I revealed to her what I saw.  That in her a large part of her needed to submit.  She resisted at first.  But the first time we talked via messenger it was obvious.  Even she will confess as soon as she sees my icon indicating I am present her legs spread wide to display her shorn cunny even if fully clothed at work.  She embraces my commands with ferver of a convert, and fills my heart with joy doing so.  This will be an interesting journey.

      Friday morning I got on IM and chatted with Erik.  Not the best use of my work time, but I couldn't help myself.  We chatted for entirely too long and he gave me a couple of assignments for the day.  At two different times I was to go to the ladies room and play with myself for 10 minutes but not come.  The first time was right after I signed off IM with him.  I went to the public restroom so I wouldn't have to worry about taking so long.  The cool metal of the stall dividers felt good against my hot bottom.  I was pretty sore from the previous night's spanking.  The 10 minutes passed quickly and I washed my hands and left for my desk.  As I was coming out of the restroom I heard my name paged overhead.  Not unheard of, but not all that common either.  As I came around the corner to the operator's desk I saw why I was being paged, my husband was there.  I felt a small flash of guilt but walked up and greeted him like nothing was amiss.  He had some flowers and a gift for me along with a card.  He likes to do things like that for no reason and when he has a reason he tends to go overboard.  The gift was a heavy silver bracelet that he fastened on my wrist himself.  Standing in a busy hallway like we were we didn't say much but did exchange a meaningful look.  I carried my goodies back to my desk and sat down carefully to read the card.  The card carried some instructions for me to follow, informing me of a clip in the bag with the flowers.  I was to take the clip to the bathroom with me at some point in the day and put it on my nipple, leaving it on for at least 1 minute but preferably 2.  Then put the clip on my clit for a minute.  I was going to have a very busy day with all the running to the ladies room I was going to do.  I took the clip with me and left it on my right nipple for 2 minutes.  It was difficult to leave it on that long and I broke out in a sweat.  But I did it.  Then I put it around my clit and left it for a minute.  Later in the afternoon I did my second 10 minutes for Erik.  By the time I left for the day I was more than a little aroused and in a fairly submissive state of mind.  After work Dom greeted me and offered me a glass of wine.  Pretty much insisted on it in fact.  I thought it was a bit odd, but rolled with it.  When I finished the wine he had me undress and led me into the gym where he had a chair with a pillow on it in the middle of the room.  Seating me he cuffed my hands to the chair with two sets of cuffs then blindfolded and gagged me, using a strip of duct tape for a gag.  I was very comfortable and very curious as to what was coming next.  What came next was he plugged up a work light that is very bright and quite hot.  I couldn't see the bright, but I could feel the heat and realized what it was.  Even with the air conditioner at my back I got hot in a hurry.    He sat down to my left and started talking.  Telling me he knew about Erik and that he wasn't as dumb as he obviously looked.  Explaining that he had figured out I had an online relationship of some sort and it was my carelessness in leaving something logged in that led him to the who of it.  He went on to describe how he had read Erik's blog (know your enemy stuff) and that he had even spoke with him on IM that morning.  Apparently at the same time I was talking to him.  He told me it wasn't the fact of the relationship that shocked and hurt him, it was the nature of the relationship.  That I was letting someone else dom me instead of coming to him with those desires.  This whole time he is talking my mind is racing, trying to see where this was going.  I have to say honestly that in spite of my position I wasn't all that scared.  I probably should have been, but I wasn't.  I wasn't particularly relieved either.  Just wondering what was going to come of it.  I didn't think he was going to throw me out but I couldn't be sure.  I briefly entertained the thought that maybe this was why the spanking got so intense last night, maybe he was punishing me in advance.  I was pretty resigned to the idea that I was going to have to give Erik up and had already entertained the idea myself.  I had thought that if our relationship was going to move in this direction that maybe I owed it to us to give it my whole attention, put all of myself into it.  So you can imagine my shock when he revealed he wanted to not only keep domming me himself, but he wanted me to continue submitting to Erik.  He asked me a bunch of yes/no questions I could answer by nodding or shaking my head.  Then he took the gag off and asked more questions.  Things like, when I was with him doing something Erik had instructed me to do, was I with him or with Erik.  I truthfully told him I was doing it because Erik said to, but I was with him.  I also told him that it just sort of came about, that I didn't go looking for even a relationship, much less a Dom.  And that I had denied the submissive in myself right up until we started chatting the first of the week.  I got a laugh out of him when I said that if it was any consolation I had fought Erik as hard as I had fought him on the few previous occasions when he tried to dom me.  He said thank god for Erik for getting me over that so he didn't have to.  I also told him I was still very confused by this person I apparently had inside me and that I didn't have a clue what she wanted or needed.  But that I was open to finding out.  I was told that if Erik wanted to share and continue our online relationship that I had to obey him and that he would punish me if I didn't.  I didn't get to talk to Erik until the next morning but obviously he did want to continue.  This wouldn't be my 2 Doms otherwise.  Before he let me go he jerked off into my mouth, using my mouth as nothing but a cum receptacle, not even letting me pleasure him.  We had sex that evening, not lovemaking.  He fucked me very hard and made me come several times.  I had to ask for each orgasm and wait until I was given permission.  Afterwards we talked some more.  Sharing some bad feelings, resentments and such.  I broke down and told him I couldn't keep being in so much control of everything, that I needed help.  I guess that is where some of this need for submission came from.  But not all of it.  And that can't explain the need and delight I take in the pain.  That's just part of who I am.

      Thursday evening we had plans to go to dinner with my parents, so I wasn't expecting anything until after we got home and I had watched the t.v. show I wanted to see.  So I was a little surprised when Dom led me into the hallway outside our bathroom and informed me I was going to give him a shower.  (for the sake of simplicity I'll call my husband Dom and Erik I'll call Erik, unless he tells me to call him something else)  I helped him undress and got in the shower with him and gave him a good scrubbing.  I offered to wash his hair but he said no and instead turned us so I was facing him and he had his back to the water.  He told me to suck his cock while he washed his hair.  When we got out and dried off he had me continue while he shaved with his electric razor.  Then he took me to the bedroom and had me kneel on the edge of the bed and teased me by fucking me but not letting me come.  When he stopped we only had 10 minutes for me to get dressed and ready to go before my parents were expected.  So I jumped up and started scrambling but he took away my panties and wouldn't let me wear them.  Dinner was a little boring, for obvious reasons.  When we got back I watched my show and he gamed a little.  Promptly at 9 I turned off the t.v. and went in the bedroom to strip and wait.  He came in and sat on the bed, pulling me over his lap.  He started out slow, using his hand and petting me a lot.  I felt a little frission of unease when he stopped to lean over and tell me my safe word.  I'll probably never forget it, it was California.  I knew something was up because we had not used safe words for my other spankings.  He started smacking me harder and when he had me nice and warm he picked up the hairbrush.  Starting slow again, he built up to some pretty stinging blows.  Petting me a couple times, but not as often as the other spankings.  I just remembered, sitting here writing about it, but at one point he used the handle of the brush to fuck me.  I was pretty shameless about it too, moaning and pushing against it.    He smacked me so long his arm got tired and I was pretty squirmy by now too.  So he had me turn around the other way on his lap.  He asked me if I wanted to stop and I did, but I didn't want it to end either.  He finally said lay down and when I did he really tore into me.  I started crying pretty quickly and was wiggling hard, trying to get away.  I was begging him to stop but he didn't even slow down.  I was crying so hard I could hardly breath and he finally stopped for a minute to speak to me.  I couldn't tell you what he said, all I remember is how soft his voice was and how he petted my hair.  I couldn't really answer him very well I was crying so much.  He finally asked if I wanted any more and I shook my head.  He made me say my safeword, which I remember sobbing out.  He immediately dropped the brush and pulled me into his arms, holding me, rocking me, petting me and whispering nonsense to me.  Just letting me cry.  It felt so good to cry like that.  Cleansing, but I didn't understand why at the time.  He asked if I wanted to be held or make love after I stopped crying and I wanted both.  So I got both, he held me until I felt like more.  I told him I wanted to suck him first.  I loved doing that, I felt so good just laying there sucking his cock, giving him pleasure.  I wanted to make him come that way, but I wanted to have him inside me too.  So he made love to me.  Afterwards I asked him to rub lotion my bottom while I got myself off again with one of my toys.  He fingered my ass a little while I was getting off and that made it even better.  Shameless, I know.  I don't remember talking that night, I'm sure we did but I don't recall what was said.  I just remember falling asleep exhausted and very satisfied and a little confused.  I didn't expect what happened, wouldn't have sought it out and if asked, would have said I didn't want it.  But once I realized where he was taking it, I wanted to see how much I could take.  To see if I could get the release I read about so much.  That I had seen him achieve when I dommed him.  I didn't know if I could do it, if I could let go enough.  Boy did I.  But the big surprise was still to come.

      After a couple of lengthy IM chats with Erik Monday and Tuesday I was very aroused and more than a little confused.  Mixed in with the usual cyber-sex back and forth was a lot of demands for my submission.  And that made me really hot.  But I was still denying that I was a sub.    Wednesday Eben came home from out of town family business.  I barely greeted him and he immediately got into his games and I got online to look for trouble.  You see, I had been exchanging emails and fantasies with Erik for about a month and a half but never chatted with him before Monday night.  And even though I felt guilty, I had to see if he was online.  I needed to talk to him.  I needed him to get in my head.  I still couldn't admit why, but I needed him in the worst way.  Bad enough I was willing to risk getting caught and to lie when I did get caught.  I said I was chatting with my brother.  I'm ashamed of that now.  At the time, I didn't care.  All I could think about was Erik and what he did to me.  But tonight he gave me a different kind of instruction.  Something to do for him in real life.  He wanted me to go to bed with Eben and tell him I wanted to suck his cock.  And then suck his cock.  I was doing it for Erik, because he told me to.  But when I was doing it, it was Eben's cock in my mouth, for real and in my mind.  I was especially aggressive and didn't stop until I had a mouth full of come.  Which I swallowed for the second time in my life.    Afterwards Eben and I talked for a very long time.  I told him I really enjoyed the playful spankings he had given me lately and would like more.  But that I was afraid to ask for it because we had played with D/s, S/M, B/D and a few other things before.  I dommed Eben and was able to really get into it, while in a scene.  But I had a really hard time living that way all the time and had pretty much been the cause of ending it.  More than one time.  So I was reluctant to ask for what I couldn't easily give.  He reassured me he held no resentment for it and was more than willing to play with me, however and to whatever extent I wanted.  So we made a date for Thursday night for a spanking.  By this time Eben was ready for round two and made love to me.  He made me ask for what I wanted.  I had to tell him I wanted to be fucked.  Kind of different for us.  But it made us both hot.    I had no idea what was coming.  No sense of foreshadowing, no dread, no fear.  I didn't know what I was in for Thursday night.  Or Friday night.  I had no clue my world was about to be turned upside down and inside out.  I was willing to admit I might have a few sub tendencies, but I figured they could be satisfied with an occasional spanking and maybe a little light bondage.  At this point I was not a sub (in my stubborn mind) and all I was expecting was a little sexy spanking.  I was about to be enlightened.

      Well I certainly didn't mean to go a week between posts, but I've done it again anyway.  It seems like this week just disappeared from under me-it was very full and very emotional and the time just flew.  Last Sunday the flogging went very well.  We had to experiment a bit to find the right tool and the right stroke.  But once he found one that made me go "mmm" instead of "ow" he knew he had me.  I was tied and blindfolded so I have no idea how long he flogged me.  I got into subspace pretty easily once he found the right rhythm and found another emotional release from the sensations.  I really didn't expect to, especially after the spanking earlier that afternoon and the flood of emotion that let loose.  I guess I just had more to let out.  Turns out what I like is the flogger kind of like  urlLink this  one.  I like it best because it is more thuddy than stingy, especially with a medium blow.    Monday was an off day, just acting vanilla.  I didn't greet him or anything.  Actually, I didn't realize I hadn't until he posted about it.  That should tell you how much I needed the downtime I guess.  That and work Monday was pretty bad, it was Monday all day long.  Tuesday was even worse.  I woke up with a headache and it went downhill from there.  I tried 3 different meds to get rid of it and none of them worked.  Plus it was another Monday at work.  I was mean to everybody and didn't even speak to some of my friends. (well, work friends.  you know the kind.  you talk at work, maybe even go to lunch together.  but don't hang out after work)  When I got home I greeted Dom, determined to try and be a good sub even if it killed me.  He could tell I was troubled but not ready to open up about it.  He asked me if I had been a good girl which is supposed to be a way for me to let him know I need attention.  If I say I've been bad I can let him know I want a spanking or something like that without having to say "will you spank me?"  But I couldn't even do that.  So he just sat there, petting my hair for a few minutes before asking again.  I was finally able to say that I had been mean to my coworkers and he coaxed me into saying I had been bad and admitting I needed a spanking.    I think it is so hard for me to just say I've been a bad girl because I've spent my whole life striving to be a good girl.  The perfect daughter, the perfect student, the perfect girlfriend, the perfect employee, the perfect wife.  It's all part of that fix-it-all and be quiet and don't draw attention to yourself baggage I have in my head.  Growing up with an alcoholic parent really warps your thinking on some things.  I'm not going to go into  that  any more though, so don't run screaming.  He put me over his lap and very lovingly started spanking me.  It took me a little while, but I finally got into it and got very turned on.  After a bit he started using a leather belt.  His leather belt, that made it even more special to me.  He gave me a vibrating egg and said let's see how much you are liking this.  I got so close to an orgasm, but just couldn't quite come.  I asked him to spank my pussy so he got the riding crop with a big leather end and used that.  Then I was able to come.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  I'm such a slut.  Afterwards I felt sooo much better.  Calmer.  Happier.  The woes of the day (and my headache) were just gone.  I still have a hard time accepting in my mind that this is what I need.  But I think the results speak for themselves.  Wednesday night I had an IM date with Erik.  This one was a little less frantic than the last one and I slid right into subspace with him.  We connected so well and I really could feel his touch.  He's right, when it works, it's magic.  I wanted nothing more than to climb through the computer lines and lay myself at his feet.  He made me want to submit my whole being, not just my body.  And that's not someplace I get very often.  More so the last week but it still doesn't happen every time.  It carried over after we signed off and I went to bed with Dom.  I was supposed to ask for something while I sucked his cock a little.  As usual when faced with a hard cock in my mouth I got a little carried away.  I didn't stop until I had a mouthful of cum.  Dom told me later he liked how submissive my attitude was, that night and other times during the week.  After the experiences of the week and especially the spanking Tuesday, I just felt more submissive.  Softer.  Wanting to please.  I told him I think I need regular spankings to keep my mindset there.  He's more than willing to help out there he told me.  Thursday I was supposed to wear a skirt to work (which I almost never do) and no panties.  I woke up with cramps and figured I was going to start my period that day so I lay in bed for a long time, agonizing over what I should do.  I finally told Dom about it and he told me to hold off and do it next week after my period.  I sent Erik an email and told him what happened and that I didn't wear a skirt.  I also told him that whatever punishment he thought was fitting I would accept for not following his instructions.  He told me the agony I put myself through was punishment enough.  I know I can ask to be excused from things that would cause me serious problems.  But I just have a hard time asking for things.  Especially in this case.  I mean, I don't normally talk about my period problems with anybody.  Not my mom or my girlfriends.  I would only ever tell Dom that I was having it and that was the end of it.  And now I'm in a situation where my body's functions are vital info to two different men.  Pretty big adjustment to make.  Enough squick.  Thursday night I was supposed to get another flogging.  Dom tied me to the massage table and started working on me.  I just couldn't get into it so he stopped and cuddled me.  I was feeling bad.  Cramps and killer pms.  Some of the worst I've ever had.  My emotions were so screwed up and I felt so bad about myself.  I have low self esteem at the best of times.  Add pms and I'm a basket case.  He talked to me, petted me, let me cry on him a little.  I didn't feel a lot better and felt bad for stopping the play time.  But it's like that sometimes.  Friday I felt low all day, I just couldn't shake it.  We were supposed to play with some toys Friday night and when we got naked and in bed he wanted me to tell him a fantasy.  I couldn't think of anything so he told me one.  I finally told him a little snippet of one, but I couldn't relax and he could tell I wasn't getting into it.  Again.  So he held me.  Petted me.  Lather rinse repeat from night before.  Went to bed early.    One thing he did that helped me was hold me while I fell asleep.  We discovered that Wednesday night I think.  I've always liked it when he would spoon up behind me but Wed. night he held my wrists in his hands too.  I love that.  Makes me feel so secure and safe.  And loved.  Every night since then that's what we do until one of us crashes.  Haven't been able to sleep like that because I usually can't sleep when I'm held.  Except for naps.  I may have to try that soon.  I can sleep with him holding me when we nap together.  Hmm. I feel a Sunday afternoon nap coming on.  After we got up and around Saturday he asked me what I needed to feel better.  I suspect he already knew the answer but wanted me to say it.  So I did.  I told him I needed a hand spanking.  (by that I meant him using his hand)  You can read the physical details in the previous post.  I'll add that I found a little bit of release, but couldn't totally let go like I usually can.  I needed more.  He offered to get something to use, like the hairbrush or crop.  But my bottom was on fire and I didn't feel like that was what I needed more of.  He finished with his hand when I used my safeword.  He sat me up and looked me in the eye and asked me what I needed, cautioning me to be honest.    I thought about it for a minute, listening to the options he offered.  I chose a little nipple play.  Clothespins to be exact.  If you put them on in just the right spot, they don't hurt at first.  It just feels like someone sucking really hard.  But the longer they stay on, the more they start to hurt.  At first he just loomed over me, holding me hands to the bed.  But when I began to whimper and squirm a little he moved over on top of me and started fucking me.  Everything was more intense.  The feel of his cock sliding in and out of me.  The sting of my nipples.  He would flick at the clothespins.  Lick my nipple under them.  One time he squeezed them a little.  I finally asked him to take them off and he said I knew how to get them off.  I don't know why, but it didn't occur to me to use my safeword.  So I waited a little longer, hating to admit defeat.  I finally said my safeword and he took them off.  I screamed.  I mean, screamed loud.  More than once.  And started crying in earnest.  I think I even hit him.  This went beyond a little erotic pain into genuine agony.  For a couple of minutes I couldn't feel anything but the fire at the end of my breasts, not his cock in me or his hands on my wrists.    Eventually I became aware of the world around me again.  He leaned down and licked my nipple, very gently.  It felt like he was rubbing it with something burning cold.  It was cold, but burned at the same time, like fire.  I knew he really got turned on by my pain.  He told me later he almost came when I screamed.  I could tell it got to him at the time though.  His breathing got faster and he got a little erratic with his thrusts.  I think this knowledge more than the actual sensations made me want to come.  He gave me a toy and kept thrusting into me.  That's how I have my best orgasms.  With him fucking me and me buzzing my clit with one toy or another.  I had 3 orgasms before he came.  He collapsed beside me and held me.  He told me that right then I was prettier than I had been all week.  I don't see how, I had no makeup on, my hair was all sweaty and matted and I was covered in sweat.  But he insisted the peaceful face and smile I had was beautiful to him.  I did feel better than I had all week.  The rest of the day I floated in a haze of submissive feelings and love for him.  It's amazing how he can give me what I need.  Understand it and love it even when I can't.  He keeps fussing that I want a mind reader and he isn't one.  But he is.  Sometimes he knows what I want before I do.  He can tell what I need, even when I can't ask for it.  It's scary.  It still scares the hell out of me.  How he can read me.  How he can hurt me.  How he gets off on hurting me.  How I get off on being hurt.  But the more we do it the more I crave it.  I want to push a little more, try new things.  I can barely look at him or admit it, but I want to be with another man.  And maybe even have him watch.  I want to do what we are planning this afternoon.  I want him to fuck me while I'm on my period.  I may decide I don't like it.  He may not like it.  But I want to know.  And believe it or not, this seems pretty kinky right now.  Because it's so taboo and we've never done it.  Not in 15 years of sleeping together.  Never even discussed it.  And I have a tremble of excitement in my stomach thinking about it.  Maybe it's just the idea of doing something previously so forbidden.  Of being so open and honest about my body and what I want.  Don't know but hopefully I'll find out in a little bit.  Last night we watched a movie together and I wore a collar for him.  He didn't want me to undress, just wear the collar.  After we sat down and started the dvd player, he brought out a leash and clipped it to the collar.  Two weeks ago I would have rolled my eyes and squirmed and fussed until he got frustrated with me and took it off.  Last night I loved it.  Loved feeling held and possessed.  Scary.  But exhilarating at the same time.  That's all he did.  Just hold the leash.  But it was very effective at making me feel owned.  Today we are taking the day off.  He's gaming and I'm blogging.  In a little bit we'll take our nap and get our freak on.  I expect it to be pretty messy so I'll offer to wash him off afterward, a shower if he needs it.  Might even try sleeping in his arms if we wear each other out.  I'm going to do his nails later, but that's all we have planned as far as D/s goes for today.  And I've typed so much I can't think anymore.  I'm not going to comb over this post for grammar and logic like I usually do.  You'll just have to take an off the cuff post for once.

      Anna got another hand spanking today. I had been curious as to how many times I actually brought my hands down on her when we did an OTK, so I counted. When I spank Anna for giving her release rather than punishment, I'm very casual about warm up and progression. I watch her carefully and increase the strokes rate and intensity based on the feedback she gives me. This experience is for her pleasure after all. The first 300 I barely struck her at all, after that I alternated between hitting her progressively harder and faster. When I had her turn around so I could spank her left handed, I was able to hit her as hard as I could without a ramp up. After about 900 or so I was really laying into her reaching way back and coming down hard with a follow through type stroke. I kept that intensity til the end only changing the rate. Slowing down to let her feel the full sting of each one, then speeding up so she wiggled under the intensity. She gave me her safe word at stroke 1576. Knock off the warmup strokes, and she still gets a decent spanking. She began to sob and cry once I put her under my left hand so she cried through about 400 strokes. Not bad for her at all. She really needed this one. Punishment spankings are really different. There is no warm up or ramp up, I just lay into her and she cries out after about 10. But today was about love. Giving her my love and approval in a way and means that translates into love in her heart and in her soul. After it's over, the relaxed facial muscles and slight grin on her lips makes the whole experience a wonderful joy. She has said she feel she needs them more, and more often. I hope that is the case, but I do need to get back in the gym and do some arm curls.

      Had a long talk with Precious on the IM tonight.  Talking with her on the IM has an associated phenomina when its right and good.  The touch I am telling her, to make, its my hand and I can feel it.  I know she feels my kiss on the back of her neck.  When can sync up like that there is no doubt to me that we can make things work.  Despite scheduals and time constraints and the fact that we dont physically touch.  But what we do have we use very very well.

      I found a blooger I can at least partially relate to. Claire of the blog  urlLink Cliffnotes  seems to have some of the feeling toward her dom in the entry Status Quo that I do toward Anna. The primary difference is Claire sees her bratty behavior as a cry of attention. Anna either doesn't, or is still in denial. Her worries about her dom seem valid to me. I have the same worries about Anna.  We took the day off again yesterday. Not even as much as a greeting. We were both still tired and I'm still trying to shake the effects of a night terror I woke to Sunday morning. I haven't had one in a couple of years so it took me by surprise and bit me really hard. Unless you've had them for a long time like I have, it's hard to understand.  Anna showed some interest in being wrapped in the big roll of plastic I have tonight. I've been looking forward to seeing the effects of sensory deprivation and bondage on her. Especially after a stressful day at work. Something to look forward to. I feel like it will touch her in a way that will put her in touch with her submissive side than other methods we have tried. Guess we'll see.  She stayed up late last night, then right when she was going to come lay down with me, work called. The end result was getting in bed super late and waking up grouchy and sullen. Not the best way for a brat to start the day. Maybe she won't have as bad a day as she thinks. Maybe if she does she won't run screaming from the very thing that might help her sublimate. Ah, you have to love all the ironies of this kind of life.

      I've been struggling lately.  Not with the physical side of things.  That's great.  It's the mental domination that I've been fighting so hard.  As a woman working in a man's field, I have to work extra hard to be taken seriously.  And having been the one who's job has provided our health insurance for about 9 years now, I take keeping that job very much to heart also.  Plus, just being a woman living in the South makes it automatically more difficult to not be overlooked or dismissed.  So I've worked at being in control of myself.  Not depending on others to take care of me, at work or in my personal life.  Making my own decisions is very important to me.  I know Dom would say I am terrible at making decisions, but I'm not at work.    So letting go, giving up control and letting someone else make decisions for me, especially a  man , is excruciatingly difficult for me.  At times it feels like I'm being asked to just give up everything I've spent the last 12 years working to accomplish.  I know, in my mind, that it's not like that.  But that's how it feels.  And I resist.  I read on a  urlLink site  recently that usually when a sub resists it is due to fear of loss.  Loss of control, loss of self, loss of independence.  And that is very true.  I resist being submissive outside of a "scene" because I want to be able to still be myself.  To have some mental privacy.  And occasionally a little body privacy.  I want to be able to continue to pursue my interests.  Reading, surfing the internet, blogging, working out.  All the things I like to fill my time with.    But at the same time, I enjoy it when I kneel at Dom's feet and lay my head in his lap.  And he strokes my hair and shoulders and calls me his good girl.  And I like chatting with Erik, feeling his will imposed on my actions.  I love being ravished and taken and brought to a violent, shattering orgasm.  So hard that I literally do shatter into helpless, wracking tears.  Like I did Friday night.  And last Monday.    I love being spanked slowly, the intensity building until I'm squirming and moaning and my sex is dripping wet and all I can think about is having my Dom's hard cock inside me.  I love being spanked with a hairbrush until the pain overwhelms me, overflowing me and washing away my emotions on a tide of tears.  Leaving me cleansed and calm and feeling loved and safe.  I even love being punished.  Like a little while back when I confessed to breaking a rule and asked for my punishment.  And like this afternoon.  Last night we had a terrible misunderstanding that left Dom frustrated and angry with me.  And disappointed he said today.  I won't go into the what or how.  But he did what he thought I wanted, what I had just got through telling him I wanted.  And I pulled away, pushed him strongly away and said no, I can't.    We had a long talk afterward, he delved into my mind, helping me find why I keep doing this.  Rejecting what I want, what I need.  It traces back (mostly) to an incident when I was in jr. high.  I was humiliatingly rejected by my peers, by the boys in my class.  More than once and very publicly.  My self esteem has never gotten over it, really.  Even when I'm doing better, feeling pretty and sexy, it's always there.  Lurking underneath, telling me that I'm not really pretty and that no man could really want me.  If one says he does, it's just to get something from me.  After all, most men will fuck anything that holds still long enough, even if they aren't attracted to her.  Right?  So he shared some thoughts on how to deal with that little girl who lingers in my brain.  Poisoning my happiness with her pain and doubt.  It won't be easy.  It won't go away overnight.  But if I can change my thinking, my perception of what is happening when she speaks up, maybe I can truly overcome her anguish.  This morning, he said he had forgiven me, but I could tell things still weren't right with us.  He was closed off to me, sad or angry.  And even though he said he forgave me, I still felt terrible about what had happened.  I thought about asking him to punish me for it, but didn't know if he would.  Plus we were taking my Dad out for Father's Day and I didn't think we had time.  Fortunately he mentioned it himself when I got out of the shower.  He put me over his knee and talked to me while stroking my back and bottom and legs.  We agreed that I shouldn't be allowed my safe word so that I would truly feel punished and that when it was over we would both move past it and not let it interfere any longer.  He spanked me pretty hard with his hand, I was in tears rather quickly, more from the emotions so close to the surface than the pain.  I apologized and accepted his forgiveness.  Then he said it was good I was feeling it before he started my punishment for real and picked up the hairbrush.  He really lit into me.  I welcomed the pain though, it set me free and let me release the hurt and guilt I felt for what had happened.  Pretty quickly I was sobbing so hard I thought for a minute I was going to throw up and I had tears and snot all over the bed under me.  At one point I cried out I'm sorry and he stopped.  Petted me a little and said I was going to get 10 more and they were my absolution.  Those were 10 of the hardest I think he's ever given me and they really really hurt.  But it worked.  Afterwards I felt clean and forgiven and loved.  I could feel love from him again instead of the disappointment I'd felt all day.  Tonight I'm looking forward to being tied up to the power rack in the gym and feeling a little flogging.  I've been intensely curious about it since he used a couple in a punishment near the beginning of this.  So I asked for it.  This will be completely different from the earlier punishment.  This will be for fun, for the new sensations on the new places of my body.  I wanted to mention Monday while I'm blogging tonight, before the emotions are completely gone.  Monday night we chatted on IM for a good little while.  It may seem funny to some, seeing as we are in the same room on our respective computers.  But sometimes it is easier to admit things and talk about them this way.  I'm still not good at communicating and will probably need a lot more practice before I am. We talked about a lot of things, one of them being my interest in other partners.  We discussed the logistics of it and I was very surprised that he felt like it was something we might one day pursue.  I had always gotten the impression, and he had said a couple of times, that he wouldn't share me.  So this was a bit of a shock.  He even offered to contact someone at work that I am attracted to, to feel him out about something between us.  I politely declined.  Mostly because I don't think he is attracted to me and would absolutely die if he rejected the idea.  He isn't someone I see everyday, but I do work with him closely at times and it would be very awkward for me if he wasn't interested.  Not to mention that I don't know if my ego or esteem could stand the blow.  So when we go to the bedroom, I thought to rub lotion on my bottom, he gets all caveman on me.  Pushing me onto the bed and arranging me the way he wants me.  Not speaking.  Using my hair to move me around some.  And he takes me.  Hard.  Fast.  Rough.  And when I come, I come so hard.  And almost immediately, before the aftershocks have faded, start crying.  Just as hard.  And I cry until he finishes, which he does without a comforting word or gesture.  At one point the tears started slowing but my brain started kicking in and they came back in force.  I was thinking to myself, this proves I really am a masochist, that I need to submit, that I want it rough like this.  I don't want gentle, respectful love.  I want to be taken and used.  And I wondered to myself why I couldn't be normal.  Not even in this, I can't be normal.    I slammed face first into a wall that I had been ignoring.  A wall that I was either going to have to climb over, into this acceptance of who and what I was.  Or let that wall stop me.  And keep me from being happy.  From feeling passion and feeling truly alive.  I've felt more alive, felt more, in the last month than I have in probably the last 8 or 9 years.  I've let myself feel again.  And realized that in order to feel the pleasure, I have to feel the pain.  (I want the pain, love the pain, but you can't have the pleasure, can't really experience it, without the pain).  I realized that I can't feel true happiness without feeling the sadness and anger and loneliness.  I've been protecting myself from the loneliness, anger, pain, hate.  I've done such a good job that I've protected myself from feeling the good things too.  It's easier to not feel anything at all.  That way, happiness can't be taken away or turned into disappointment.    After he finished using my body, he tied my hands behind my back and turned me around on the bed and moved up behind me.  By this time I had pulled my walls back around me, protecting myself while I thought.  I had to come to a decision, was I going to go forward, accept who I was, what I was and experience the breathtaking pleasure, feel alive again.  Or was I going to play it safe and stop the whole thing.  I had to admit to myself, truly confess it, that I was a masochist.  That I wanted to be used.  That I wanted to be hurt.  That I wanted to be controlled.  That I wanted to feel these things, this intensely.  And that this was the way to do it.  I had to think about that, decide if I could live with myself like that.  Or if I could live without ever experiencing those feelings and sensations again.  Dom said later that he felt me pull into my shell.  That he saw what I was doing.  All night, I slept very little, mostly dozing.  The next morning I leapt out of bed as soon as possible and left for work as quickly as I was ready.  All day at work it was never far from my mind.  After work we went out.  I was very grateful, I couldn't have been at home with him yet.  On the way to the closest mall (a 25-30 minute drive) we started talking.  Slowly I told him what had been on my mind and what I thought.  I apologized for hurting him with my withdrawal, but explained that I had to.  I had come up to the place where I had a life altering decision to make and I couldn't handle any outside stimulation or input.  When we got to the mall we sat in the parking lot for a long time, talking it out.  I told him I was still committed to giving this lifestyle 30 days of complete devotion.  I told him a little of what I had felt the night before and some of what I was thinking.  We were still good, better after I opened up and shared what was going on with me.    I still have some reservations about part of this, obviously from last night.  But I am making every effort to give myself to it, find what works for me and us and what doesn't.  I think when our 30 days are over we may have something to work with in negotiating how we will live this.  At least, that's why I'm doing it.  Dom is waiting for me to come play so that's all for now.  I'm off to the floggers...

      The trend among blog talk seems to be leaning toward non sexual submission. See   urlLink THE BIG HUSH  And  urlLink BLIATZ  for example.  So far, all I have seen is a submissive POV (point of view). Naturally I can't speak for any dominant besides myself. But I can describe what I'm looking for and what I get out of non sexual acts from Anna as a submissive.  First of all, I am a person, not just a mindless dominating machine. I get things out of the relationship just like Anna does. While the focus of the matter centers around her needs, like to submit, and to feel the nurturing that comes from being submissive i.e. feeling loved, wanted, cared for, ect. And the need to have new experiences with sex, with pain, and so on, I do have certain desires of my own that I like to see fulfilled in this sexual arena. Don't let anyone fool you. Being a Dom is hard work. We don't call it work, we call it a joy to do of course, and that is absolutely true. I can never recall having the kinds of pleasures I have had since beginning to Dom Anna. Still, there is considerable effort put out by all your Dom's out there whether they will admit it or not. Obviously there is the physical labor, planning and setting up scenes, being able to change those plans 'on the fly' when things go wrong (like a leaking enema bag) and the plain physical effort that it is to do what needs doing in real life and still be able to spank your submissive beautiful bottom long after your arms ache because they just entered the magic space inside themselves.  Now, before any submissive gets the wrong idea, and any Dom's get mad at me, let me make it clear. If you find yourself thinking "Oh GOD! I'm making my Dominant have to work on something they don't want to do! I have to quit,  I'm a failure, (Insert pity-party mantra of your choice here) Just QUIT! Quit thinking that right now! Bad Submissive! Your Dom loves you and does what they do because it makes you BOTH happy. Period, paragraph, end of notes. Got it?  There is also the mental discipline involved in being a Dominant. Especially a male dominant if you get my drift, and that's all I'll say on that. But other disciplines include trying to get inside the submissive head and find what little fires of passion are burning in there at the particular moment (they can change instantly it seems) There is the disciple of focus and attention. Watching for the tale tell signs of too much or too little stimulation. For example, when I use a hairbrush to spank Anna, I watch her very closely. I want to just lay into her and watch her bottom wiggle and turn red. I want to make her writhe while I hold her down and force her to take more. I want to hear her cry out, and cry tears. Oh God, I want that. Instead, I focus, and watch her. I try very hard to spank her hard enough that she gets right on the razors' edge of stimulation. It hurts, almost too much, but not quite. So she moans and wiggles just a little and most importantly, she feels alive! I want her in my lap thinking how good it feels, yet how she almost can't take it. I want her to feel that moment of truth when she wants it to stop, but she doesn't. Where she's thinking her safeword really loud, but isn't saying it.  I well imagine for the experienced Dom, it's easier They have the skills. For me, it takes all my focus and mental discipline, and a bit of luck. But when I get her there, it's so moving, I sometimes would like to cry with her.  Now don't get lost in the shuffle, we are still talking about non sexual acts and submissives so don't get worked up. Breathe....That's it. Relax.  Ok so being a dominant is a lot of effort. But when it works it is more than well worth it. Hence, a dominant wants a good return on their efforts. No one invests a heap of anything hoping to get a stingy return. That is the beginning of where non sexual acts come into play.  While it is a lot of fun to beat and sexually service Anna, at the same time I am a very visual and tactile person. (I like to look at her, I like to touch her) I get a lot out of seeing her dressed for me in a certain way. I get a lot out of certain body motions that she makes, that cannot be consciously duplicated. (I wonder how many people realize this about themselves.) I like to touch her in certain places and ways. And, I like to have her touch me, look at me, and express certain body language at me. All of these things that I dearly enjoy are not afforded merely within the confines of a sexual encounter whether it's vanilla sex or kinky. My desire to see and touch her in these ways I find so attractive are a part of getting a holistic, sum total experience of Anna's body. Her beauty, her grace. None of us look or move the same. We all have bodies, we all move, we all have body language. But no two people use the same combination of these things. That is a large part of what makes us exactly who we are. (How many people realize that?) This is why you can just "feel" it when you hit it off with someone. Your reading every combination motion that they are making. The interface of body and soul, and you are able to perceive that you like what you see of them.  I would suspect that a submissive (especially in a relationship) that finds themselves asked or required to do things that make no sense, while they are scrutinized by their Doms very carefully, are in a situation where they are very attractive to their partner. If you have read my post "Does She Know" then you know how I perceive Anna when she is doing things for me. These favors that I get form her have nothing to do with what is going on. I'm not trying to change her thinking all that much when I have her write sentences, I'm not looking for a sexy maid if I have her pick up around the house in the nude (I have not asked this of her btw it is an example) I am not trying to humiliate her when I have her assume positions and pose, or tell her I want her to workout, or play Dance Dance Revolution for me wearing nothing but socks and my collar. These are all excuses. And poor ones I might add, for the truth. And the truth is... (Big breath before sticking my head in the noose)  Being able to relax and not have to worry about what I'm doing, or saying, while she does those things, and just watch her move, feel her skin on mine, and enjoy her body and her fluid movements is an incredible turn on for me. And If I can get her to do it long enough, I begin to feel an incredible warmth of love and passion inside of me. Kin to subspace itself I'm sure, I begin to feel like I must be a pretty special person myself to be treated and given to in such a way. It is inspiring. Awe inspiring. And it gives me strength, confidence, and will. Yes it is a power thing. But not the kind of power thing most submissives assume it is. It is an EMpowering thing. I don't know why this is so obscure. Maybe Dom's are unwilling or unable to admit this. Maybe they don't realize it themselves, or maybe I have just given away a secret that is not supposed to be revealed under pain of death and leather clad executioners are on their way to my house to kill me as you read this.  Anyway. That's a peak at me. For what it's worth. (which is nothing in chat rooms) And NO, Anna, this is not a play to get you to do more. I won't ask you for any more of different now that I have made this public. I really am responding to the other blogs I have read. I am not manipulating you. (I hear a collective "Yeah Right" out there) but judge me by my fruit would you?

      In the continuing effort to educate and better myself in this new lifestyle, I thought perhaps I would search the many chat rooms that I have heard about over the years. Now I know lees about chat rooms than I do the art of domination, and I have found that, the reverse is true with the members of chat rooms. I chose the chat room "SAFE Haven D/s Discussion" on the Yahoo servers because of the name. Knowing little like I did I thought I would be able to post my questions and express my concerns to intelligent, knowledgeable people of like minds. What I found was a haven of stupidity, mockery, and namecalling. After posting one question and watching the chat line take what I said out of context, I began to explain the question in more direct terms. The result was an argument about the tangent that the group had gotten off on. I was told I was a liar, I was told I didn't know anything (which really perplexed me because I was there to ask questions) and that I was an insincere fake. The following is an example archive of one individual who even "followed" me out of the chat room when I had to close it out over a privacy issue:  darkknight35us (4:09:53 PM): your story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese  verge1_0 (4:10:56 PM): No. You just don't have the whole story and would rather argue than reason  darkknight35us (4:12:58 PM): I've seen many many players and liars on here the funny thing is you believe the shit you write but I and other see right through it but its ok no skin off my nose keep perpatrating the lie and maybe it will come true BW  darkknight35us (4:17:36 PM): that's good coming from you as Ive seen how much knowledge you have darkknight35us (4:17:41 PM): nota darkknight35us (4:17:48 PM): as I said be well  verge1_0 (4:18:34 PM): That is exactly what I have claimed to have. I came to your pitiful little band hoping for a bit of understanding and education. What I get I guess    darkknight35us (4:18:34 PM): and by the way I am an OPEN BOOK   So my advice for anyone who is trying to learn anything in this kind of lifestyle is don't go to chat rooms. You will only be mocked, ridiculed, and not taken seriously.

      Sun Tzu teaches:  "It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war that can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on." and "The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply-wagons loaded more than twice."  While to the layman this will appear to be irrelevant and make no sense to a relationship. If you have studied tactics and logistics as much as I it means something rather valuable. Combine this with the important advice that you find in every major BDSM information gathering about the importance of understanding what you are doing and educating yourself I come to one steadfast conclusion.  Be Prepared  Naturally, I am taking ridicule for it. From within my own circles and without. However I stand by what I do, and have done. For me to do less than gather every nut and bolt that I can about this kind of life, to learn everything I can of how to, when to, why to, and to finally find out the very hearts of desire in my own submissive, would be foolish and hypocritical.  "Know yourself, know your enemy, know the terrain."  I had gathered intelligence about this situation in secret for so long, I had hoped that my zeal to learn in the open would be taken as a positive sign. What it has resulted in is words like suffocating and obsessed. So be it. I forget sometimes that I am still seen as the antagonist in this situation, not a loving participant. And as a result, my desires, and opinions (Like on big girls) are not welcome. Again so be it.  "The general who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth;"  I will recede. Until I become more Bulwark.

      I'm still around, I haven't been tied up and left in a closet somewhere :-)  I've just been really busy the past week.  A business trip and a lot of soul searching hasn't left me with much time to post.  And I have been very deliberate in staying out of the "big girls" flame war.  For one simple reason.  I don't agree with my Dom's opinions and I'm trying to be respectful.  Well, two reasons.  I'm not comfortable with my own size and I don't particularly care to talk about it.  And if I talk  bad  about myself, I get in big trouble with my Doms.  So there isn't much I could add and not get myself in trouble.  I'm glad to see people responding to us though.  That's very flattering to know that others are reading our efforts and are interested in our journey.  I have a date with Erik tonight but I'm supposed to have some free time before then and I'll try to post some of my thoughts on what's been happening the last few days.

      It's amazing how one simple bit of information can completely alter the perception of a scene. We did a scene yesterday and in the closing minutes of it, I tried to make the context of it sexual (That is what Anna is into.) When she told me I was the "cuddlingest thing" I had a clue that several hours later I have now realized that has caused a fundamental shift in the way I should do scenes. Cuddling does not equal something sexual to her. Sounds simple, but it's a breakthrough to me. I had no clue. Now I know, next time I know more how to end a scene. Day by Day, inch by inch I learn.

      I had a short conversation with Precious this eve after a breakthru recovery with Eben.  The spanking she recieved reminded her of the place she wished to be.  I have told her I feel at times more a council than else.  Tonight she needed to be mentally cuddled a bit.  Have tried to explain to her that more than anything else she is a brat.  Equal to all in all manners save for her sex.  There she needs a strong hand to force her submission that she may experience all that she can at her most free.  She doesn't understand yet but she will.  Her side of the scene with Eben was exstatic save for one thing, she felt an overlong pause needed a new warm up session.  Her concern was rewarded by Eben.  One of her rewards was to watch her favorite tv programs uninterupted as long as she remained unclothed.  Upon listening to her side and hearing most of his, I gave her instructions to perform for me during this 'Reflectory' period.  To enjoy her tv program but during the comercial breaks to take his cock into her mouth.  Not a blow job, not a suckle, no suction or swallowing, simply to hold it in her wet warm mouth for the duration of the comercial.  A fitting way of reminding him of warmth deprived and the thought of teasing him so seemed to give her much thrill.  I hope to hear soon how the evening progressed.

      This weekend has been a see-saw battle. Last night I started out scene with a catnip enema for Anna. While the effects were good, the bag had a malfunction which stressed out the scene in the opening bell. I didn't think it was going to go off, but it did. After, I tied her spreadeagle to the bed, with a crotchrope, blindfold, and gag. I put vibrating eggs in her and on her clitty. I told her I was going to leave her tied alone in the dark like that for half an hour but she was not allowed to come. She grunted and protested this, but I just turned out the light.  She probably figured it out, but I never left the room. Light from the outside was just enough to let me see her light form on the dark bed. I stood where I was for the entire time mezmorized by her condition, her figure, and her squirming and sighing. It was a beautiful thing. As much or more than the day she wrote sentences. Her bound and helpless form swinging between trying to lie perfectly still, and the desire to struggle against her bonds and the buzzing between her legs. Gasps and moans let me know a couple of times she almost lost her self control. Truth is I'm disappointed that she didn't. I wanted her to come in that position. To cry out into the dark against her merciless bonds and torment, only to have it not end there until her entire time was up. I of course would be left with the (sigh) hard duty of punishing her for the infraction. Oh well. Wasn't to be. When the time was up, I didn't let her go, instead I cut the crotchrope and stimulated her most sensitive spots with a certain egg I use. She squirmed, and bucked, begged and pleaded. But I allowed her no right to orgasm. Finally exhausted, she slumped in her bonds. I told her this was a set up for tomorrow's orgasm. But that was little comfort at the time.  When I let her go, in the aftercare she told me the scene wasn't what I had led her to believe it would be. While it was true I did enjoy seeing her body, she didn't pick up on that. She also mentioned that I had said that I would mark her, but we ran out of time for that really. I felt a lot like Thomas Edison must have, when trying to invent a working light bulb, and had failed the 1000th time. Seems like everything I have tried lately has been flawed. Inexperience, and having to be a Dom of experimentation.  This morning found us cuddling and she suggested I could look and touch her better from the massage table (hint hint) Glad for her effort to speak her desires (especially after the days I've had) I told her to get on the table. I massaged her body front and back for a full two hours. Drinking in every inch of her skin, every line and curve. Every sweet breath and moan. Time flew like crazy. I only knew I had been there so long by the cramps in my hands. When I was done she told me I had missed a spot and directed me to her slippery sex. Not one to squander such an opportunity, I worked my fingers into her and tried to bring her to a frenzy. When she seemed really hot I got her toy and told her I wanted her to come on the table while I watch. In no time she was moaning passionately into my mouth as I kissed her through her orgasm. After I took her to bed and I got my second "make up" orgasm. I allowed her 2 more for good measure.  After we had to leave the house to go on a visit. When we got back it was time for her promised marking. She greeted me properly, and we retired to the bedroom. One more time I had her assume the position so I could take in the treasure that is the sight and touch of her body. After I laid her down to spank. I warmed her up for a long time, so I thought, then began to spank her working my way up in intensity. However, as usual I was in the wrong as far as her headspace. She called yellow once or twice and I was happy because I thought she was communicating. Then she called red without and of the usual positive signals that I see form her. Bad news. I went ahead and began aftercare and had hopes that I could get from her what went wrong after the fact. My heart sank but I didn't want it to show. Soon she asked "Can I tell you something?" Please do was my response. She opened up and began to tell me how she liked to be spanked for pleasure! RAPTURE! The Vulcan has spoken! We tried again this time using her parameters and getting feedback from her I got calibrated to her needs. The next time she called red, she has squirmed and moaned, and now, she was not dry! I told her I was so proud of her opening up to me I insisted on her having an another orgasm. She had a rather hefty explosion and again, I cuddled her. After the massage and this, I feel encouraged and energized again about being able to care for her in this relationship. I'm learning a lot. I'm not practicing everything I shuold yet, like keeping my mouth shut, but I'm trying. Hopefully she has learned a lesson this weekend to.

      I told Anna I wanted to make up for how much I missed her this last week. The things most important to me in her. The sight of her, to touch her, and to have power over her. I also told her I wanted 3 orgasms this weekend. One oral, one anal, and one from her sex. I told her she could choose the first way and she chose oral. She laid on top of me giving access to her pussy and asshole for a time. I licked and fingered with glee. I really love to lick her twat, but I don't get to very often. Her taste was sweet and exciting. I got so lost in what I was doing when she rolled off of me she wondered if I was distracted, or disinterested. I was enjoying her body so much I forgot about mine. She quickly fixed that as she laid at my side and focused on the rhythmic pumping and sucking that she does so well. It was no time before I felt a huge orgasm build up and detonate in her mouth. All those days without her had left me with a load for her. To much in fact, she missed a bit as I exploded between her lips.  She said she wanted time to blog and to watch tv today. I told her I wanted to tie her up tonight. I'm going to tie her spread eagle on our bed and I am going to ravage every inch of her that I can. Toes to head I want every part of her under my hands, under my tongue, or under the toys of pain and pleasure I love to inflict on her squirming perfections. This will be the first time I have tied her this way in years. Using the pink coils of rope I bought the day she fell at work, I hope to secure her to that bed and make her feel all the love and excitement I have for her built up inside of me.

      After the slow week we have had, and a couple of egregious errors that I have made this week, Anna told me she wanted to negotiate. She said she wanted to try the lifestyle, but have more of a concrete understanding of what to expect and what was expected. How to handle reality when it interfered and downtime. She also said she wanted to know what my needs were.  When we got together, this is what Anna wanted:  Play time is limited to 2 hours on weeknights that we play. She plans on making significant use of the "Immunity" necklace.  She did not make it clear if weekends would be more lifestyle, or just larger blocks of time, I'll have to nail that down.  We changed the greeting to more easily help her slip into the mindframe she needs.  She wants simpler scenes, and has safeworded certain kinds of scenes and bondage.  She agreed that while we were in our timeblocks of play that she would agree to be mine to use and play with in the manners that please me. And she believes that the "House Rules" can be kept and still used effectively.  She wants to carry out this plan for 30 days then decide if she wants to continue or not. So this agreement will expire July 12.  I've published this for benefit of Erik and myself so we have a clear guideline to follow. Hopefully, Anna will have the time and space she needs to decide for herself if she wants this kind of life or not.

      It's been a slow week on the surface, but minds have been racing. It's not what you call on subject but I do have a bit of a rant.   I was chatting with a friend of mine in California today when she told me of an incident where some brats yelled at her from a moving car, "Hey, try Jenny Craig!" I told her that this is why God invented the rocket launcher. Now she takes things in good stride, and she says that she only gets down on herself occasionally, but there are many many more that are not so fortunate. They take things like that to heart, and into relationships, and to bed. And that is where I begin to take it personally.  It's never been made really clear here but I don't mind putting it bluntly, if a woman weighs less than 200lbs, she probably isn't even going to catch my eye. Now before you go off with your comments and snickering e mails I have one thing to say; fuck you.  I not only have a brain in my head, I know how to use it enough to make up my mind about what I consider attractive and what I don't. I don't need Cosmo, or Hollywood, or joe lunchbucket standing next to me in line at the store to tell me this is attractive and that is not. Most of the clowns I know that complain about the weight of their wives just use that as an excuse to one, be lazy in their relationship and not bother to make an effort to keep it hot, and two they would rather lust after some other little number because she don't know what kind of limp dicked dead fuck they are.  Skinny chicks (IMHO of course) are by majority, unattractive. They are bony and weak and have the look of the starved, beaten dog you see in the street. They hide the truth from others and themselves with lingerie (that big girls don't need) and by using this mysterious social advantage they have to the hilt. That's it. They have no other assets. Breasts are inadequate to please, even if sufficiently sized if they are alone on a plain flat dull surface. It's like serving lobster on a paper plate. An ass that you can fully grasp with one hand is nothing to play with and enjoy. I could never spank a little girl. No pleasure in it. Nothing to look at. I could never have a skinny girl to hold. I'd always be afraid of breaking them in half. Even if they have decent tits, so what? Nothing to back them up with. You can't rest your head on them anywhere. You get poked with bones rubbing their back is a disgusting proposition who want to caress someone's spine? Someone might say sex is better with a little girl. How? Number of positions, or access maybe? Bullshit! When it comes down to it, pussy is pussy and the difference is in the PC muscle.  If you like skinny chicks, good for you, you can have them. You can have them all. But don't make fun of what you don't understand. You mindless, brainless drones are victims of someone thinking for you and I think your the idiots here not I.

      Monday I had an accident at work so Monday night and last night I wasn't up to much fun.  I tripped and fell on a printer and managed to split both lips and acquire many little cuts and bruises all over.  Nothing too serious, but I have been pretty sore.  And this morning I am going out of town on a business trip until Thursday night.  So no fun stories from me til the weekend I'm afraid.

      Im'ed with Precious and Eben a bit today.  Its surprising to me just how in synch they are without knowing what the other person is thinking.  Told Precious that I was feeling a little bit like a BDSM marriage councilor to which she told me I am doing a great job.  My observation of them is that they are both planners, but Precious decides a date and throws herself in like child hurtling down the boat dock tword a lake that a week before had ice on it.  Eben will let the situation unfold then strike like a musketeer with his 'so fine rapier blade'.  The result?  They arrive at the place they want to be but both of them are confused as to how.  Me?  I feel like the king of Siam, watching his favorite concubine dance to a tune played by a raw but powerful musician.  The talk I had with Eben this morning was about rules.  I suggested three be recorded for all to know.  Rule 1, Precious must let her Dom's know her wants and needs.  Obvious I know but you would be surprised how many sub's act as if the mere admission they are sub should be all the indication of what they want at all times.  Rule 2, its Precious's duty to use stop, slow, or go words as needed.  Again obvious, but hard as well.  Precious has incredible endurance, much like any other pain slut I have ever encountered.  She has to be observed constantly because she will literally hold her breath till she's almost blue rather than say 'hey that's the 50'th wack and I am needing to be held.'  Rule 3, If Precious feels the need she can request a day dedicated to her.  This often gets overlooked in live in relationships.  Things get over the top.  There are times that you need to say I want to be a normal person again without all the yes sirs, asking permission to go to the bathroom, waiting for doors to be opened for me.  I want to be independent for a day so I can cherish what I have all that much more.  As a group I would say dom's are very observant of this, but face it, even the female ones have more than a few male stereotypes.  We aren't mind readers, we can say the wrong thing at the right time, no mater how much we hate to admit it their are nanoseconds of time where while we might not be wrong, we may surely be less than 100 percent accurate.  The flip side is true, we are observant, we know what we want, and despite appearances to those outside of the community, we actually want the pleasure of our partner more than our own pleasure, even if we have them in orgasm denial.   A very good friend said something to me about observing someone pick the candies out of a bulk bag that their lover disliked.  I was casual in a test of Eben this morning, ya hes getting picked on, but its a compliment so all yall can put up with it.  Eben knows her favorite flower, her favorite candy, her dress size now, and the dress size she wants to be.  When he had a chance to blow mad money on himself, he got her a fancy hair cut instead because it would make her happy.  She's as lucky to have him as he is to have her.  I hope this little experiment brings them as close as they deserve to be.

      I woke up this morning to a cuddly husband.  While I did my morning 3 minutes of teasing myself for Erik he scooted over to watch, as usual.  This morning found me getting more aroused than usual though.  When I stopped playing with myself, Dom picked up where I left off, telling me to show him how to do it the way I liked.  I guided his fingers to the best spot and he teased me for several minutes.  I told him that Erik had said the night before that I deserved to come at least once today, because of something that happened between he and I.  He seemed amenable to that.  Then he rolled over on top of me and wanted me to show him how to fuck me.  That was a lot more difficult to do.  Because I have a hard time saying what I want or need.  He was patient up to a point, trying different things, different positions and speeds, asking how this or that was.  I was having trouble giving him more than just answers to his questions.  He finally got frustrated with me and moved back to his side of the bed.  I lay there for a few minutes, struggling to come up with the words he wanted.  I finally moved over next to him and started giving him some specifics of what I liked.    I would tell him someplace I liked to be touched and how I liked it and he would do it, asking if that was it.  It got easier the more we did it that way and he returned the favor, showing me a couple of particularly sensitive spots of his own.  I got my orgasm this morning and instead of announcing that I was coming like I usually do, I had to say thank you Erik.  Seemed fair since he was the one who said I deserved it.  It was nearly 1:30 by the time we got out of bed.  Good thing it was Sunday.  We were both starving and somebody had a craving for ice cream.  So I made him an offer, I would fix us a nice lunch if he would go get his ice cream.  I went all out, fixing steaks, au gratin potatoes and garlic bread and he brought back salad to go with it all.  After we ate we played school with him being the schoolmaster, of course.  We went over some basics of submission.  I felt like it was information I needed because of my lack of experience and the problems we've had this past week.  Some of it was a bit daunting but when I brought that up he pointed out that each relationship is different and once I had the basics down we could take what worked for us and leave the rest.  That helped some.    We got some ice cream and sat down to talk for a little bit, going over some things that had come up in the class.  We set some limits that I think will help me be more comfortable with this.  Things like when we are at home I might be subject to punishment or correction for things I do that displease Dom, even if it's not a written rule between us.  I'm not sure about this one but told him I wanted to try it out and see how it worked.  The reason I agreed to try it was because I got a little aroused thinking about the possibilities and I decided to let that guide me.  What I did next was very hard and very scary.  But also very exciting.  I sat in his lap so I could cuddle up into his neck and talk to him without having to look at him.  That made it a little easier.  I told him it would help me if he would give me the punishment for breaking one of the rules that he hadn't given me.  Then I confessed that I had broken that rule another time he didn't know about.  In case you are curious, the rule was I am supposed to ask permission before using the bathroom while I'm at home.  Friday morning I flagrantly broke it and told him to put the penalty on my tab.  Then Saturday morning he got up before me and closed the bedroom door so as to not disturb me and it was easy to sneak to the bathroom without him knowing.  I could have gotten away with that one and honestly, I didn't feel all that guilty.  It wasn't like the transgression was weighing on me.  But I wanted the punishment.  When I told him I needed to be punished he asked me if my heart was pounding.  It was.  He asked me if I was excited and I admitted I was.  He told me to get undressed and go arrange myself on the bed, on hands and knees if I wasn't too sore from yesterday's workout and if I was too sore I could lie flat.  I did and he came in shortly.  He leaned over me to tell me how proud he was of me for confessing and that I was a good girl for that but it wasn't going to lessen my punishment.  The penalty for breaking that rule is 10 licks with his belt, so I had 20 coming.  He didn't warm me up and he put some power into them.  I know he didn't hit me as hard as he could have, but it was hard enough that I was crying before he was done.  He held me and petted me a little while I cried.  Then he surprised me by telling me he was so proud of me that he wanted to reward me.  I could have my choice of another orgasm or some more belt.  I thought about it for a few minutes, knowing which one I wanted but having a hard time saying it.  I asked which I would get if I didn't decide and he said neither.  So after a few more minutes I asked if I chose the belt if he would start a little slower this time.  He assured me he would, that this time would be out of love instead of a punishment so it would be a slow build up into it.  This time I got flat on the bed and he sat beside me, starting out with little smacks.  Working up to stronger blows that made me squirm and moan.  He stopped a time or two to rub my bottom, giving me a break before starting again.  When he had moved on to harder blows I relaxed my muscles and that acceptance seemed to be the key to letting me fly.  It wasn't long before I was sobbing hard and after about another minute I cried out my safeword.  I cried much harder this time, probably harder than I did Friday night.    After I cried myself out in his arms and blew my nose so I could breath I started rubbing his cock through his jeans.  I asked him, teasingly, if it gave him a stiffy to beat me so he showed me that it did.  I slid down in the bed and took him in my mouth, sucking him back to a nice hard erection.  Not to brag, but I'm pretty good at sucking cock so I had him moaning in short order.  I didn't stop until he came in my mouth and when he did I sucked him dry, licking him clean.  I have discovered that I love to do that and have done so on many occasions lately.  I slid back up to cuddle in his arms again and asked if that was an adequate thank you for my belting.  He agreed that it was.  I told him I felt very loved and cared for and very special.  I wasn't trying to get anything else for being a good girl, but I did want him to know how I was feeling so I took his hand and put it between my legs so he could feel how wet I was.  He seemed impressed, telling me it would be a shame to waste that and proceeded to start teasing me, rubbing my clit and sliding his fingers inside me.  He got up after a couple of minutes and got one of my toys, handing it to me and telling me he wanted to look in my eyes when I came.  I started using it but before I got very close to my orgasm he informed me he had another erection and we decided it would be a shame to waste  that .  He told me to turn over so he could take me from behind (my favorite position, I admit) and I could use my vibe to get off.  It wasn't long before I felt my orgasm build up and I asked permission to come, obeying one of my rules.  I had to beg but he finally said yes and when I let go I had a long, hard orgasm.  I thought it was going to last forever.  I came so hard I started crying again.  Afterwards we cuddled for just a few minutes before he sent me to blog about it while it was still fresh.  He brought me a glass of champagne and we toasted our relationship.  He told me my actions screamed so loud he couldn't hear my words, referring to my reservations about being submissive.  And that brings me to right now and I'm going to go watch a little t.v.

      Saturday night I finally caught up with Erik on IM.  I had not talked to him much since Tuesday night's episode and was missing him.  We chatted for a bit, he asked me how I was.  I tried to play it off, but he wouldn't let me.  He knew from husband Dom's posts and from chatting with him that I was struggling.  I told him about Friday night and a little about Saturday morning.  I thought I had distracted him but I hadn't.  He came back to asking what was troubling me.  He finally dragged out of me that I was just still having trouble trusting the situation or myself.  I don't know what I want or can't let myself have it.  The same old fuh fuhs I've been fighting since I went back to work after that first roller coaster weekend.  He's good, to not just know something still troubled me but to get it out of me online.  I don't know if I could hold my own against him in person. He would probably have me bent to his will before I finished saying 'Nice to meet you.'  Anyway, we talked a little more, I told him I was pretty sore from the morning's romp (see Dom's post.  yeah, I'm a slut.  I didn't expect what happened to happen either.  but I sure enjoyed it.)  And mentioned my throat was a little sore.  So I was dismayed when he told me to go get my buttplug and some desensitizing lube.  I sat there for a minute and started to type ok.  Then I erased that and typed I don't know if I can handle it tonight.  Then I erased that and typed 'can I ask not to tonight?  will you be mad?' and sent that.  I took over 2 1/2 minutes to respond and send that message but he answered back almost immediately, telling me I was a good girl and that he was proud of me.  He went on to say he knew I wasn't up to it but wanted to see if I had learned anything about communication.  I was so relieved I nearly cried.  I thanked him for not being mad and admitted I really struggled with saying I didn't want to.  Then he told me he would tell Dom to make sure I came at least once on Sunday as a reward.  It was very difficult, more than you would think, to say no to Erik.  Or ask if I could say no, more accurately.  Even though some might say, why? He's just a presence on the other end of the internet.  But he is more than that.  He is my Dom and I've agreed to submit to him so it's my duty to do as he says and to try my best to please him.  In some ways it is easier to submit to him than to my husband.  I have a history with my husband, along with some baggage, that gets in the way sometimes.  Plus I have to look at him when I submit.  That is very hard for me.  It is easier when I'm blindfolded or can close my eyes.  But he knows this I think because he is constantly telling me to look at him.  Usually that is the hardest part of whatever he is telling me to do.  With Erik, I don't worry about how I look to him.  Erik has to rely on his imagination to picture what I look like following his commands.  It is easier in that regard, but it makes it so tempting to cheat.  Not do the things I don't want to do.  So far I haven't done it, but I've been very tempted sometimes.  Like Tuesday night.  Tuesday we played and Dom was home.  In the same room gaming.  That's the first time we've played with him home since this started.  Of course Dom got curious and wanted to watch when I started getting toys and clothespins to play with.  Erik said he didn't mind him watching but wouldn't let him help.  I had to carry out his instructions myself.  I did for as long as I could but I got to the point that I couldn't do it any more.  I really don't know why, I wasn't really doing anything I hadn't either done in front of him before or had him do to me.  I think it might be because I wasn't expecting it and wasn't mentally prepared.  Which is kind of odd because I have a bit of an exhibitionist streak in me, or so I thought.  And I have fantasized about being with two guys at the same time.  But that's different, I wouldn't be performing for both of them like I was this time.  Then again, more than once when I've tried to act out a fantasy it blew up in my face so this one might too.  I got pretty upset and basically told Erik that I had to stop and left the room after he told me to apologize to Dom.  Erik had wanted him to watch and had plans for it that I messed up.  I did apologize and we talked a bit.  He is a man above men for not kicking me out when he found out about Erik and truly incredible for wanting me to keep my relationship with Erik.  But he still struggles with it himself sometimes.  He apologized for making me uncomfortable by watching and told me he wouldn't do it again.  This is an odd situation and we don't have any role models to look to, we have to figure it out for ourselves.  Making this work, finding our own niche, not stepping on anybody else's toes-it gets tricky sometimes.  But as long as we all want it to work, and I think we do, we'll find a way to make it happen.

      I let Anna sleep in this morning to about 11:00. Bless her heart, she would sleep all day if I let her. I had wanted to wake her early with a coffee enema, but maybe tomorrow. Today I felt she had earned her cozy slumber. However, I am a mischievous imp and I do love her body. When it was time to wake her I crept into the bedroom, lube and Vasoline in hand, and climbed in bed to finger that incredible ass of hers. Now this isn't the first time I've done this mind you. Ever since these....Possibilities...."Opened" up to me, I have dove into it like a Honey Badger at a bees hive. I love to wake her up early before work that way. Even when she thinks she hasn't wanted it, she has accepted it and then enjoyed it (see her post).  Today I woke her with one finger, then two, then three. I really only expected her to enjoy one, then roll over into my arms for a post scene cuddle. But last nights missed orgasm was telling on her. She rolled all the way over on her back and spread her legs a little wider.  When she did this Sun Tzu's rule of moving when it is to your advantage came to bear. I quickly moved behind her to gleefully take her. She asked for an orgasm, and I agreed. We got her a toy and it didn't work. She had a bit of a tantrum and threw it across the room while I retrieved another. Now I am not unsympathetic to sexual frustration, but that part was a little out of line, and I don't think Erik or anyone can fault me for explaining that one to her already bruised tail a little later (Strike one).  But I digress. Anna is a slut. I mean a serious slut. I discovered early she was a pain slut, much to mine and Erik's delight. Now I have to conclude that she is an ass slut as well. For the second time this week, she has been begging me to let her come before I've even got a good pumping rhythm fucking her ass. I chided her for being such a slut and agreed. Then she wanted another. I've been down on her having more than one lately so I encouraged it. Then she wanted a third, and a fourth. Well I guess I've been to soft until today. She was overstimulated and couldn't get the 4th one off despite me telling her to (Strike 2). So now I'm making a hard and fast rule about it. No more than 3. This will be a lot of fun because she will know the cutoff is 3 but she will beg anyway. But all she's going to hear is "no" Naturally I reserve the right to say she only gets 2 or 1 or none. But 3 is now a hard limit. We agreed we needed to shower and I told her to go ahead and get a head start. So what does she do? Goes and sits at the damn computer and surfs! (STRIKE 3! YOU ARE OUT!) I didn't say anything, but I have been way too soft until now. Little brat already has it coming again. Hard to keep such a super slut under control.

      The scene went off, but not without it's hitches. Just as I got into the swing of my preparations, including dinner, the power went out and stayed out. I know that living here in the south I should be grateful that we have power, and indoor plumbing, at all. But the timing was aggravating. However I was undaunted. I simply made a call to a pizza parlor and made arrangements for a pickup. Anna and I took our meal to a local park. The weather was nice and I wanted to be good and sure I had lights when I returned. We talked and had a good time. After coming home we began to play, but my off timing that began with the brown out stayed with me. I made several on the fly decisions that gave our scene a rough edge to it. It just didn't feel like a well prepared set up. This is a disappointment to me that I can only blame on myself and fate. Anna was a trooper all the way through. Anna took far more enema water than she ever has before and held it for me a rewarding long time. I was extremely proud of her. Even in her suffering she had a playful attitude. In the scene, we agreed on a marking quality spanking for her, a bonus I did not count on. But again, fate and timing tried to play havoc. We have 2 hairbrushes, a short straight one, and a crooked handle, longer, lollipop type. I tried the latter this time, believing it would be the better of the two. Anna's new training and the trust she has in me shined through as she found a way to communicate that the other brush was better for her. Again, she pleased me in her acceptance and expression. As far as timing. All of you experienced spankers know that after the warm up, but before you really lay into your submissive to mark them, there is a point you can pause at and let the endorphins and excitement in the brain, catch up with the body. Pause at the right time, and for long enough, your Submissive will fly straight to the moon when you resume the spanking. I told Anna that was what I was doing the 1st time with the wrong brush, but I had to do it again after changing. I tried changing her position to finish the spanking and, again, she effectively and rightfully communicated her concerns with me. She humbly mentioned that I had not done what I said I was going to do in "Busting her ass" I told her she was right. (This was the perfect que I needed for I had planned top delay longer than she needed by a teasing before returning to her ass) And I took up the brush in the new position and began again. This time I finally hit the mark and she slipped deeply away into subspace. I got caught in another dilemma right away, and I have to confess I acted selfishly. She began to cry. The very special cry that she has when she has reached that point of magic inside herself. I wanted to keep spanking her, adjust the pace so that she would stay at that point just as long as she could stand it. I also wanted to see her beautiful face. In those watery eyes, and streaming tears there is a face that she never shows. I've never seen that look on her before just a couple of weeks ago, but that look is the one that melts my heart. It is the look of open honesty. Vulnerability. Without defense or defiance. Her soul is laid naked before me in those eyes and she needs me to cover her. I whisper to her to let it out, and she does. She cries and cries tears that have nothing to do with the data of the nerve endings in her bottom. She weeps what she weeps for in the awe of pure, unabashed freedom to express what no words can utter. It is a face I would long to look upon every day. If only her bottom could take it. So I act selfishly. I lean in and study her face. I can tell she is a little disappointed by her body language. But in the state she is in, it's a small point. I study that face, those eyes, her tears and the sounds she makes. They are sights and music that I try to keep an echo of in my head for as long as I possibly can. I don't delay too long. I want her to get all she can from this. I begin to spank her hard again. Again she moves to a peak of tearful expression, but she can't hold it. She soon says her safeword and I take her into my arms, as best I can with her hands lashed to the bed.  At this point I'm back to my original plan And guesswork on implementation. I planned to tie her to the bed and slowly tease her with various sensations to ecstasy. But this was before all the delays, and the pleasurable sidetrack of a harsh hairbrushing, it isn't to be. The night has become to long, and the sensations of her spanking have left her senses far too shorted to enjoy more subtle essences. I choose a couple of items. Headache cold presses that I put on her bottom, and a fur mit I rub her all over with. She gives only half toned signals of interest in sex. My guess now, looking back, is that is was a form of assurance she needed, if I was reading her right at all, and she did indeed want it. I put on a lubed up condom and took her from behind for a while. When I rolled her over I could see that it wasn't working. A gentler approach was what was called for. I made a mental note of this for next time. There was no way she could peak again after all she had done. She asked me to stop, which I was about to do anyway based on what I saw in her. She got a little upset. She knew I wanted her to have an orgasm, but it wasn't in her, even with the offer of her best toy. It was easy to see and understand. All the stimulation had simply blown her up. She muttered about my orgasm and I asked her how she felt. She told me that she felt loved and cared for. I told her that was all that mattered. I meant it to. Having her like this is a treasure far beyond a mere getting off. And as long as she felt as loved as she conveyed, her orgasm can be made up anytime. Getting off is one of the smallest elements of this game. Any fool can buck-thrust cum out of themselves, and usually do. But the privilege of pursuing the deepest reaches of one's emotions and soul, is a place few will take the bother, the study, the pain, and the willingness to put ego aside, and go to. These are the things I seek in Anna, and in myself. Mistakes in the scene? You bet. Several. But I have noted what I've seen. I have high hopes Anna will "Monday morning quarterback" with me, if I can assure her there are no personal feelings of self esteem invested in her critique. My esteem is driven by what I'm doing as a whole a Dom. And who I am becoming by doing it. I find that I myself have been hidden behind masks. Something I promised myself 8 years ago I wouldn't do. Ah well, grace is most kind to me that events have fallen the way they have. I am in love all over again with an incredible woman who is blooming like a plume of flame from a phoenix at night. And I don't feel so bad about myself as much either.

      I spent the morning cutting and coiling out lengths of soft rope. 6 ft., 12.ft, taping the ends. I've given my drawer of personal knick knacks the boot and filled it with the tools and toys of this "dark" art that I'm looking to ply. I've equipped the bed with nylon strapping, rings, and fastening points. I've made a spreader bar, all for the pleasure of having Anna tied, stripped, and writhing for me. The thought alone is delightful. I spent the mid morning with Anna's dad. I acquired his services in repairing the massage table that I broke the weekend before. We talked and worked until now it is sure to hold her well for pleasures of massage, and pleasures of play. This afternoon I've secured what I'm going to serve for dinner. I'm about to prep for the scene that I have planned out the last few days. I'm excited. A little nervous after some miscommunication have been confronted, but the feeling is fueling my desires. I am confident of the scene. Anna knows a scene is coming and with luck the anticipation is working on her as I write. Time will soon tell.

      I'm finding I don't have enough time to keep this as current as I would like.  I'm kept so busy with everything-real life, work, submitting-that I'll suddenly find I haven't written anything for several days.  I'm going to quit stressing over it and just write when I have the time, or when I can steal a few minutes.  Let's catch up here.  Tonight Dom had to work and I haven't seen Erik online so I've just surfed the net and caught up my vanilla blog.    Last night I had an online session with Erik that got a little too intense.  Dom was home and became interested in what I was doing.  And came over to watch.  It's kind of unusual for Erik and I to play like that when Dom is home.  I have to confess that instead of being exciting it was distracting.  Maybe because I wasn't mentally prepared for both of them.  Maybe because I still feel a tinge of guilt over Erik.  Maybe because of half a dozen other things, I'm not really sure.  All I know is I couldn't get into or stay in my headspace like I usually can and had to call a halt to things.  I regret it, but I just kept getting more upset and finally asked to stop.  My evening ended in tears and an apology to Erik and one to Dom because Erik  wanted  him to watch and actually had plans for that.  *sigh*  Next time, maybe.  Tuesday afternoon was very enlightening.  After greeting Dom he brushed my hair and petted me a bit.  I felt restless, needy, but didn't know what I wanted.  I finally asked him to do something, anything he wanted, to make me feel like I was his.  I didn't mean to make it a test but I think that's how he saw it.  He tied me up in a modified hogtie and left to get something.  Coming back he told me not to move and put something on my back.  Because of the position I was in and my curviness, he had trouble finding a flat enough surface.  He finally did find one and he asked if I knew what it was.  I said I didn't but suspected it was either a candle or a glass of water.  Turns out it was a glass but it was empty.  Nice psych though.  He got the riding crop and teased me with it and then the phone rang.  It was my mom and he talked to her while fingering my ass.  It was a little difficult to keep quiet, especially when he handed me the phone with instructions to get rid of her and went back to enthusiastically stretching my ass.  I got off the phone quickly and was soon begging him to fuck my ass.  He was quite generous and let me have a toy to enjoy my missed orgasm (the one I didn't get Monday).  After begging for the toy of course.  And begging to come.  It was a very intense orgasm but I only got the one so I was left wanting more.  Which I'm sure was the point.  In any case, I did feel very much owned after that and quite submissive.  I don't think I was even as bratty as usual after an orgasm.  I'm sure Dom will correct me if I'm mistaken.  Monday night's punishment.  It was quite effective in getting my attention and definitely made me resolve to watch my tongue around my Doms.  But honestly it didn't have quite the intended results.  Not at first at least.  I had to cut short writing my lines because our power went out and when we went to bed Dom told me he was disappointed I didn't get to blog about the experience, that he was curious to see what I would write.  The next morning I got up and was still fuming so I decided that as soon as I got a chance at work, I would put down a post about it, but not what he wanted.  I knew what he wanted, he wanted to know how it made me feel and if I thought any differently.  Well I was going to be a brat and just write the details of what happened, with no mention of how I reacted to it.  Or maybe just say that yes, my attitude was different but no, my thinking wasn't.    I really couldn't say why I was so infuriated by it all.  Possibly because I'm not used to being punished for my failures.  I try so hard not to fail at anything and when I ever do slip up, I work extremely hard to fix it or make up for it.  In this case, that wasn't an option.  I know I didn't appreciate being punished for an opinion, I still don't know if I like that part of it or not.  And to make it all just a little more fun, I started my period Monday and was feeling really crappy.  We had lunch together and talked about how or if the little matter of my biology asserting itself was going to affect our play.  We decided to more or less do the same thing we are with most of this, play it by ear and see what felt right.  Dealing with cramps and the aftermath of my punishment, I passed on my chance to have an orgasm, even with the understanding that it might be several more days before I got another opportunity.  I just knew I wouldn't enjoy it.  I was too humiliated, too angry and too determined to be a brat.  Until I read what Dom  urlLink posted  about the evening.  It very nearly moved me to tears and did more to soften my thinking than the spanking or writing the lines did.  To see myself through his eyes like that was breath-taking.  It's something I am very rarely able to do, see myself as others do instead of in my own warped mirror.  I felt beautiful after reading that.  I may have to print it out and keep it posted close by (maybe next to the mirror) to read when I'm feeling unattractive.  Re-living the experience after reading that and Erik's comments both on here and to me personally I have a different post to write.  I understand how much love and frustration went into that spanking and how important it is to my Doms for me to have a better opinion of myself.  I feel gorgeous and cherished and very very loved and cared for, by two wonderful men.  I also owe them (and myself) an apology for dissing my looks. So to Dom and to Erik, I'm sorry for not appreciating your compliments and not taking them to heart.  And to Anna, I'm sorry for not loving you for your own uniqueness.  Sunday started off with a bit of a fright.  Dom had been out of town and I wasn't expecting him home until the early afternoon.  I had just got back into bed and dozed off after getting up to go to the bathroom.  I also undid the deadbolt, just in case.  He had told me the night before that if he could get an early start he might slip in and surprise me.  But I really didn't expect him to, certainly not as early as he did.  So I was dozing with a cat curled up beside me when all of a sudden there was a hand over my mouth and a body behind me.  It gave me a big start.  He had slipped into the house completely silently and had a stocking over his head.  He then proceeded to "rape" me.  Tying my hands behind my back with a curtain tieback was a nice touch.  He wore a condom like a good rapist, leaving no evidence behind, and used his leather belt on me when I struggled.  It was exciting and I think I can look forward to a more intense repeat in the future.    Sunday afternoon we went shopping and bought me some feminine things to lounge around the house in instead of my usual tee shirts and shorts.  I bought a couple of camisoles and a lace trimmed tank top and some sheer cheeky panties and lacy ones to match the tops.  I tried on one last night, a hot pink cami and black sheer panties with hot pink polka dots and trim.  Dom was quite impressed and I did feel pretty in it.   We went to Hot Topic at the mall too and got a few accessories.  These  urlLink bracelets  really make me feel like I belong to somebody when I wear them.  I like.  I picked out a wristband for Dom that looked appropriate to me.  Couldn't find a pic of it though.  Saturday was more or less a day to myself.  Went and splurged on a pedicure and manicure and treated myself to my favorite lunch.  Dom was out of town and I didn't catch up with Erik.  Saturday evening I spoke with Dom on the phone but we kept getting interrupted so we didn't get to do a phone scene like he wanted.  Friday night I had a pretty intense session with Erik via IM.  He is amazingly good at controlling me thru the computer.  He makes me want to do whatever he tells me to do, just because he wants it.  I guess that's what a good Dom does though, huh?

      I was really tickled to find Anna letting me know what she needed after our greeting and me dotting over her being a good girl by brushing her hair and massaging her body. It took a little more probing to find just the thing to make her feel like a submissive treasure. But it was extremely encouraging and fun to find the just right hot spot. I rewarded her, and made up for her missed allowed day with an orgasm. She is blooming quickly now and rapidly becoming a glorious submissive to play with.

      Anna was crying by the time the brush stokes were done. The final count was 11. One did not land to suit me. I had her raise up and I kissed the tears coming out of her eyes. I love to see her cry this way, out of this kind of pain, rather than the other. She has an entirely different posture and look. I gently nip at one of her lips that are wrapped around her ball gag. I give her only a moment to sit still in the glow of her spanking before I have her up doing the sentences. I want that chemical cocktail in her to help make an impression on her brain about what she is writing.  I'm not a big fan of television. I rarely watch it unless I'm doing something else to go along with it. Maybe a meal, house chores, and the like. I'm not much on being a passive watcher. However, watching Anna write on the white board last night, line after line after line, was a sight that was most impressive and stimulating. She was nude of course except for her collar and bracelets. I kept the ball gag in her until she was dried up from crying. For the most of that time, I studied her face. That beautiful, flushed, tear stained face. How she can look in the mirror into that face and see anything less than striking is beyond me. Especially considering what there is here to compare it to.  After that I changed position and watched Anna's whole body as she worked. Every shift of her weight off one foot to the other translated into an erotic dance. She was goddess-like gorgeous. I carefully watched the bright red splotches fade off of her bottom, drinking in the vision of that lovely ass. Even this morning the vision of it in my head is still clear and arousing. When she would shift her feet I would look at them. They are petite and perfectly proportioned. I envy this myself because I have these abnormally long toes that I could wrap around someone's neck if I chose. But her brightly painted, pedicured toes only accent a symmetrical shape, a perfect arch and a mouth watering form.  Up her calves and thighs, that show the tale tell signs of weight training, I pause to look forward to seeing what those thigh backs are going to look like red and striped from discipline. Back to her now pale bottom. I knew 10 would never be enough. I placed them as well as I could but she should have marks to show this occasion to remind her that she is a well loved beauty. Ah well. I have plans to mark her later in the week anyhow. I should be finished with my stencil today or tomorrow.  The rest of the two hours she spent at the board I watched her back and upper body. It was a real tease show. As she would move and turn with the advancing sentences on the board, her back would sway and dance and give me little peeks at the beauty that was facing the board. Occasionally, her face would peak out from her hair and shine for just a glimpse, like a star on a cloudy-windy night. Likewise would her breasts and her belly. Twice I had to reach in my pants and idly pinch my frenum to keep my seat and not rush her in my arms to kiss her deep and throw her in my bed. I'd have those thoughts, then I would remember why she was in this position to begin with; in her mind she has been unworthy of such attentions and affections. It boggles the mind. Further, I mused if her keeping such a tight lid on her submissive side was all part of this. That she hid it feeling somehow unworthy of such things. I know the truth is she believed I would not understand. But still, a passion as deep as hers comes from a long held desire of the soul. She could not advance so far so fast without a burning in her heart to match and exceed the expressions of submission she is able to give.  This is not over. Not by a long shot. The power went out and we called the evening short. I had her come to bed, and I didn't say anything. I've been running off at the mouth lately. Picking her brain, talking dirty to her, and trying to express my appreciation of her. I figured it was about time to shut the fuck up and let what is, be. But she soon began to cry in my arms. At first she didn't want to tell me what she was feeling. What I coaxed out of her was a concern that the positions we put her in and things we had her do made her look ridiculous. That kind of clashed against how she has told me "assuming the position" has made her feel in the past, so I'm not sure what she was referring to. I do know she began her monthly cycle today and had expressed concern over lunch, but wanted to see how she felt trying things anyway. I'm not sure if it was that, or if the punishment for her self dissing had brought it out. Maybe she misunderstood a gesture of appreciation while in a submissive pose, I'm not sure. But I talked to her at length about how her submissiveness and her body are the single most beautiful things I have ever seen. Her beauty is serious business to me. Her seeing it in herself, even more so.

      This is an official sleepless night. The reasons for it to be sleepless are so numerous and overwhelming I was a fool to lie there for this long.  I guess I'll take events in reverse chronological order. Maybe half an hour ago Anna had a dream of "some" variety that made her call out in her sleep. I've grown to expect her to snore some nights like tonight, but not call out names. A name that is neither mine nor Erik's. But rather the name of a co-worker she had a crush on for some time. They make cow-eyes at each other and are shameless in their flirting. Beyond that, I know nothing of anything physical they have shared. But I do know that there is something in there that feeds Anna. A nutrient of the soul she finds...Addictive. I make a supreme and conscious effort to stay out of her "affairs" in this matter, if you'll pardon the pun. I've told her she could keep her crush and that I encouraged her fantasy life provided she looked to me for a physical outlet. But I'd love to know what the element is in that crush that feeds her desire for it even when she's getting more sex, attention,  and  affection than she can handle.   Reason number two for the lack of shuteye is the fact that I did what is called "jerking a nut" a painful condition of the testicles. I did that during reason #3 so keep reading.  Nuff said.  Reason number three is I jerked my brain from it's mooring. The plan was to watch a movie while I held a leash attached to her new collar.  But she wanted to offer me a late greeting right before.  She had made ZERO effort to be submissive up to that point since coming home, and had been very flirty about how horny she was. I chided her about it and she balked a bit. I told her I couldn't pamper her all the time to which she replied "Why not?" While she "Assumed the position" I got the idea that this might be one of those times to just roughly  have her. Erik recommends this treatment more often than I hand it out, but the moment seemed right. I greased a finger with Vasoline and applied it to her back rosebud. I had told her she was off orgasms so I wasn't about to take her the other way. Besides, this seemed right. I mounted her and took her. HARD. Hard enough she cried a bit. At one point she made an observation that made me stop, but then said it was o.k. so I finished. Her crying made me want to stop. But I had told her I was not going to stop things unless I heard her safeword, which she did not utter. After it was over. I gently and lovingly cleaned her. I could tell from her body language she was embarrassed or humiliated. She is very sensitive to those kinds of things and she often projects it on to me. I, however, am not the least bit sensitive to the things that make her self conscious and think nothing of it. So in order to be a comfort, I whistled a tune and made nothing of what I was doing. I applied a little pain relief ointment to her and she drifted away. At first I thought subspace. But she went really away...Too far away.  As I began to try to probe her body language, her breathing, and her muscle tension to find where she was, it hit me. THE flashback. In the Spring of 1976, as a 3rd grader I was molested at school by a high school senior. I've long since put the event behind me, yet now the memory came back on me so strong that I could hear the sounds, smell the smells, and feel the pain as if was happening all over again. Wrestling for control of my senses, I questioned myself "why this? Why now?" and the answer that came back to me very nearly caused me to be sick right on the bed: "You have become what you hate." Tears were already flowing from the memory, now comes a sick feeling I care never to experience again.  Anna's stillness and  distance only seems to confirm that I have indeed violated her in a way that was not my intent. The room spins and almost goes away completely. But I am experienced with this kind of event. In years past I would feel it almost daily and have trained my mind over time to regain control. I began to reason with myself in a mantra that would save me from making this worse.  In the end, Anna told me she knew I was having problems, but she said she could do nothing about it at the time. This I understand. But she never did tell me what she was experiencing. This tells me she was processing trauma, not subspace. But she hasn't confirmed. And it is that aspect that troubles me the most. When she returned to herself she offered up a fantasy which we immediately played, but with results less than I would have hoped for. After she asked to watch TV, then it was to bed for me and she stayed up a bit to blog.  The silence about her take on the event is deafening. I know I Pearl Harbored her and I now see the value in not doing that. Far better to stick to plans made. Lesson learned I swear.  As for me, I think my "moment of truth" is actually the turning of a personal page in the book. I've had a couple of experiences  like this where something I did to Anna, caused me to let go of something in myself. But nothing like this, and not on this scale. For this it would have been a sleepless night anyway even if I hadn't been hurting in the nethers, and hearing another man's name called out in my bed.  But it's Anna, her feelings and her emotional well being that really drives me from settling into slumber. All I can do is think of her.

      Yes, yes.  It's the Icee Hot post.  Hope it lives up to the buildup I've given it, don't you?  I'll start with the beginning of that day and work up to it.  Last Saturday I was awakened around 4ish by Dom pulling my legs out from under the covers and putting socks and tennis shoes on my feet.  He pulls me up, discards my nightshirt and pushes me out the door.  I grumble a bit but go, I'm still too asleep to form a coherent protest.  Stepping out the back door he stops me at the bottom of the steps and sprays bug spray all over my naked body.  This stuff is freaking cold and it wakes me completely up.  And I'm mad.  Not just mad, I'm MAD.  You see, I'm not a morning person.  And while most people would consider this still the middle of the night, when I don't get enough sleep, I make a grizzly bear seem friendly.  Waking me up in the middle of the night when I got to bed late is somewhat like disturbing a hibernating bear.  Not a good thing.  So I don't say anything, I just glare.  He leads me to an old clothesline post in the back yard (which he has thoughtfully wrapped with plastic wrap to protect me from rust, sharp edges and creepy crawlies).  Stretching my arms out he ties them to the top post and ties my feet to the bottom of the post.  Honestly, I couldn't tell you if he tied me around the middle or not.  I was so mad I barely noticed anything.  When he stood up I refused to look at him.  Taking my chin he forced my head up and I let him have my glare with both barrels, still not saying a word.  I could see the disappointment in his face and figured he would let me go.    I was so wrong.  Instead he left me to stew.  I didn't have my glasses on so I'm not sure what he did, wander around the yard I guess.  He walked by a couple of times, not saying anything, just checking on me.  At some point he asked me a question or told me to do something.  I ignored him so he swatted my legs with a switch.  What did he want of me?  Don't know.  I was still fuming.  After letting me simmer for about thirty minutes I started to get tired.  I wasn't really softening, but I was too tired to stand up so rigidly.  I kind of slumped a little and relaxed my posture.  I had figured out I was going to be there a while so I tried to get comfortable.  He noticed and came over to check on me.  My hands were falling asleep by now but I refused to tell him.  However he noticed me clenching and unclenching and shaking my fingers and realized the problem.  He let my arms down only to retie my hands behind my back.  Then he tied my breasts.  Tighter than he ever had before, any of the times we'd played.  And starting teasing them rather cruelly.  In spite of myself I started getting aroused.  Dom seemed pleased.  At least I assume that's why he brought out a toy and started teasing my clit.  He got me right on the edge of orgasm, even told me I could have one.  And the damn toy sputtered and died.  ARGGGHHHH!!!!  Of course, not anticipating this particular problem, he didn't have a spare and had to go inside to get one.  I would have been happy to go with, but he left me at my "post".  He was only gone a couple of minutes, but I started feeling sick at my stomach.  I honestly don't know if it was the bug spray (I'm very sensitive to such things, but I'd been wearing it for a while and usually if I'm going to have a reaction it happens pretty much immediately), the early hour, the sudden drop of arousal or if it was some internal defense coming up (the Brat, maybe?).  By the time he came back I begged to be released so I could lay down.  I would have laid in the grass but he led me inside.  I didn't even make it to my side of the bed, just falling across the end.  The nausea subsided after a few minutes and Dom seem determined to give me that orgasm.  So we tried again with another toy and I had one.  Small, not terribly satisfying, but an orgasm none the less.  He sat beside me and petted me while telling me not to apologize for ruining things and that I wasn't in control of the scene.  Yeah, I figured that one out on my own.  I really expected him to cut me down and send me back inside in anger when I wouldn't cooperate.  But I'm glad he didn't.  I needed him not to.  I wasn't consciously testing him, but looking back that is what I was doing.  I crawled back into bed and slept for several hours.  The rest of the day?  We went to the next town (that has a mall) and went shopping after stopping for a bite to eat.  We bought several things and made a stop at the Dollar Tree.  I don't know if this is a southern phenomena or not, but I love these stores.  They have all kinds of junk and everything is just $1.  Sometimes you can find a real bargain, the rest of the time it's stuff that would cost around a dollar at WalMart and some of it is real trash.  But it's like a treasure hunt because you never know which it will be.  Anyway, we picked up a bag full of goodies, including a jar of icee hot.  Now, the thing about this that filled me with dread was, Erik had told me a couple of days earlier to put some on my clit before I went to work one morning so I would burn for him.  I told him I would, if we had any.  Fortunately for me, we didn't have any.  Or if we did, I couldn't find it.  I'm pretty sure I'd told Dom about it and I wonder if Erik had mentioned it to, prompting his purchase.  It didn't take a mind reader to figure out what  that  little blue jar was for.  We spent the evening in more vanilla pursuits, surfing the net and chatting.  Somewhere later in the evening Dom brought it up, trying to persuade me to willingly submit to it.  He could have just tied me up and then brought it out, but either he was a little wary after the morning's incident or he just wanted me to submit.  I'm not sure and I haven't asked.  We went back and forth and I reluctantly agreed, with provisions.  I wasn't being a brat, I was negotiating.  That's what you are supposed to do with big scenes, things you've never done before.  Right?  My conditions were, one-he had to promise to untie me the second I said my safe word so I could clean it off.  And two-he had to promise to be extra careful not to get any inside of me.  Scented lotion burns me like the devil if we ever use it for lube so I could only imagine what this stuff would be like.  Hummph.  He agreed to my terms and led me to the bedroom after making his preparations.  Stretching me out on the bed he handcuffed me to a spreader bar and tied my ankles to another one.  I was surprisingly comfortable.  I had dreaded the spreader bars but now they are one of my favorite bondage toys.  At my request he blindfolded me but didn't gag me.  He started out by teasing me, stroking my body, playing with me.  We had bought a couple of snakebite kits while we were out and he put them to good use, on my nipples and clit.  He got me really aroused before bringing out the icee hot.  Just to be clear, the plan was to use it on my clit and surrounding area.  At first it was very slick and cold.  As he rubbed it in it started warming up.  I started whimpering and moving around before it got really hot.  Truthfully, it was uncomfortable, but not nearly as bad as I expected.  At first.    One thing you may not know about us is that we use scenes as healing episodes at times.  Dom has punished me a couple of times to help me let go of guilt or bad feelings that interfere with our relationship.  It's better than therapy.  Sometimes these things come out when it isn't our intent, it just happens with very intense scenes.  Mostly I just have a very cleansing, deep crying session.  Other times I cry and rail about things.  I'm not really ready to get into details other than to say I have issues that depress me at times and have affected my self image and self esteem.  Dom already knew from when we had played before in reversed roles and from all of his research how this can happen.  And he knows about most of my issues, so he is taking advantage of it to help me deal with things.  I don't know if it's these episodes in particular or our relationship in general, but I'm starting to put a few things behind me.  A couple of them have popped back up and I'm sure others will too.  But it's helping.  It's also doing amazing things for my self esteem.  I say all that to say that Dom wanted to make this session one of those kind of sessions.  He felt like I was holding on to some stuff that I needed to let go of.  The only thing I really felt that way about was that morning's scene so I mentioned it when he started questioning me.  At his relentless probing I came up with a few more things I'd had regrets about.  When he applied the icee hot was when he started talking and questioning me about this.  It wasn't as much what he said as how he said it.  What he said was important, but it was his tone that I really responded to.  I started crying a little.  This apparently told him to pursue it and he kept talking to me.  When I had my list of regrets or guilts out, he told me he was going to apply some more, punish me for these things.  He warned me he was going to be more generous with it this time and really rub it in.  (as a side note, he isn't punishing me for whatever I'm feeling bad about doing/not doing.  he is punishing me for holding onto them, not forgiving myself and letting it go.  it's a subtle distinction, but an extremely important one.)  True to his word he slathered on a huge gob and rubbed it in hard.  This time it really burned and I squirmed and cried in earnest.  He talked to me while rubbing it in and got more at least one more time.  He rubbed hard, it would have been uncomfortable even without the icee hot.  The icee hot made it agony.  At some point, I let go.  Accepted the pain and the absolution it offered me.  And flew.  I was deep into subspace and asked for more through my tears.  I even asked him to put his fingers inside me.  I really cried when he did, but my sobs were a mixture of pleasure and pain.  I undulated my hips, raising my pussy and abused clit for more.  I was sore, super sensitive.  And flying high.  Dom brought out a little egg toy and buzzed my poor clit, wringing another small orgasm from me.  He released me and held me for a bit, petting me and loving me.  When I finally got up to use the bathroom he warned me not to wash it away with water as long as it still tingled.  For once I listened to him and merely wiped as much away with toilet paper as I could.  I crashed into bed shortly after and slept late Sunday.  I already told about Sunday night's spanking so I won't go into that again or the rough afternoon we had.  Dom told me, after reading my post about Monday, that he didn't give me the collar to help me or push me over my hurdles.  He said he did it because he felt I was ready and because he trusted me to make the commitment.  Pretty humbling.    That seems like a good place to stop for now.

      And yes, I'm writing about the Icee Hot incident.  And about this evening.  I'm still floating on a cloud right now though.  Erik wants me to write it so I will.  I'm glad somebody else wants to hear it too.

      Just an fyi...I love comments.  I wish everybody who stopped by would leave one.  If you don't have a blogger account or don't want to log in you can leave one anonymously.  I'm looking at adding an alternate commenting option, if I can do it and keep the comments we've received.  I'm a little too lazy to copy them all and create new ones but it might take that.  If it does, I don't know if I'll bother. Anybody else have an opinion on Blogger comments?

      The first day of our new union...(deep breath of the fresh air)....And gag coughing.   Anna woke up in Brat OVERDRIVE I was actually glad when she left to go to work, which is highly unusual for me. Ah well I immediately began to plan the evening based on it. Some writing sentences based on some affirmations I made to help her self esteem, some time in the corner and the world would be right again. I had some other surprise goodies, but seeing how it went "not quite to plan" I'll save those for later.   My search for a job came to a head when a prospect required an interview at a time that I was scheduled to work my current job.&nbsp; Job is less the word for it. They are starving me to death not giving hours. I confronted them about this yesterday and they gave me attitude. So today when I go in and explain developments to them, they hit the roof. Seem&nbsp;like they could not understand why I would give up their generous 18 hour a week schedules for a chance at a&nbsp;40 hour position somewhere else. I tried to be diplomatic, and it got ugly.   Now anyone who knows me, knows I am a confrontational person. I'll fight you. I'll fight you just for kicks. You can walk up to me and say "Hey, want to fight?" and I'm good to go. I love the sensation. The adrenaline, the fear. I live for it. (CAVEAT: &nbsp;as long as it has no significant emotional attachment)&nbsp; But today I had already been kicked twice. My morning had not been smooth at all, and my job search had lead me out of town, in blazing heat, and taken hours only to produce the need for a second two hour interview that was sure to cost me....This blow to my esteem; I turned my back and walked away, rather than facing off and getting smart back.  I don't know for the life of me why. Exhaustion maybe. But by all rights I should have laid into her instead of getting in my car and driving away, only to feel like a complete sap a mile down the road.   Anyway, I stifle it. I've got bigger fish to fry, and I'm bound to get that new and much better job.  (insert hard swallow here) I've got Anna the Brat to deal with. I stop by the drug store and pick up a decent enema bag. I go home and ply my creative skills to my new trade and set up the scene, brew&nbsp;a catnip tea solution for the enema, set up the sentence writing board in the punishment corner. Get the affirmations I want written set, set up the massage table under the power rack and hang the bag,&nbsp; get the plug for the retention time at the ready, and pick up.   Before I can even get my shower she's home! On time for once. I sit and wait for her to walk in, giddy for a chance to get this day going in the right direction. She hits the door. Falls to her knees beside me on on the couch. I look in her eyes and....   She's in pain. Terrible pain. It seems her cycle has kicked off a week early and she's in a bad way.  Right away it's a change of plan. I tell her to get some medicine in her, and I get her to lay down.  I lie down with her and I talk to her, soothe her as best I can while we wait for the relief to take hold. When she gets&nbsp;up to sit I fix us something to eat and I massage and stroke her hair while we wait. After dinner, I watch a bit of TV with her. In the evening she says she wants to do something to take her mind off it, so I set the enema back up and administer it, just not quite to plan. Very slowly, and the entire time massaging and stroking her. Once it's in I don't plug her, I just tell her to hold it as long as comfortable, but not to crap. She has enough of that going on. I play with her hair and try to be as soothing to her as I can be. When she mentions something that sounded like regret I told her that a good Dom was also a friend, and right now that was what she needed the most.   She crashed immediately after voiding. Exhaustion from the previous nights combining with&nbsp;the strong herbs, and hopefully, my love and caregiving to give her some rest.   While this may not seem like the dominant thing to do to some of you, it was the most loving thing to do for Anna. The corner and white board&nbsp;will be there, the Brat will diffidently be back.

      I know, it was cruel to tease like that.  I'm like that though, a bit of a tease.  And a lot of a slut.  So Monday evening I went to a salon at the mall for a haircut.  After the haircut, Dom led me to one of those aqua massage tables set up in the mall.  I had 10 minutes in that thing and I believe I could have stayed all evening.  It was wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone.  It feels like a dozen hands massaging you.  Afterwards we sat on a bench outside the the place and I commented that I must have been a really good girl.  Dom said maybe he was just buttering me up for something.  Well I didn't have a clue what was coming.  He told me to turn around and close my eyes.  He put a collar around my neck, sitting there in the middle of the mall!  I nearly swallowed my tongue!  Unfortunately, the one he picked out was too tight so we had to trade it for a different one.  He was pissed because it ruined his surprise but I was in shock and barely noticed.  Shocked he would do this in public and shocked I was going to let him.  I even tried on the new one he picked out at the import store.  So he puts the new one on me and makes me walk downstairs and wait for him while he does something else.  And I wore it home.  I wore it until we were ready to eat supper and took it off because I wanted a picture of my new haircut without the collar on.  After we ate he had me come and kneel at his feet.  He said he had one more thing for me.  He had already told me the collaring at the mall was a test, to see if or how much I balked.  I guess he decided since I didn't that I was ready for the next step.  A day collar is what he called it.  A nice heavy silver chain that matched the bracelet he gave me when we first started playing.  I asked him if that wasn't what the bracelet meant and he said this was different.  He wanted me to give myself completely over to him when we were at home together.  This means asking to do things like watch tv or play on the internet, whatever, instead of just to go to the bathroom.  Did I mention he took away all my rules a couple of weeks ago?  No?  I'll get to that later.  I think it's putting it mildly to say I was a bit freaked out.  I mean, the public thing pushed me, but this.  This was a serious commitment that I wasn't sure I was ready for.  He thinks this will help me over that last hurdle of being able to submit more freely.  I tend to get real bratty when he initiates a scene I don't want to do.  I suspect this won't change overnight.  I accepted the collar and what he wanted for it to mean.  It was a lot easier when he said he wanted to try it til the end of the month and see how things were going.  He promised we could back off if I needed to.  When I sat up and raised up on my knees I got very light headed, felt like I was going to faint.  That's never happened from kneeling before.  Both Dom and Erik think it was the emotional impact of what I had just agreed to.  I'm not so sure because I got light headed when I stood up after my massage at the mall.  But I'm not discounting the possibility.  I'm also not entirely discounting the possibility that the reason I started spotting last night was because of the collar at the mall and my overwhelming reaction to that and not just the fact that my hormones are completely screwed up right now.  Later in the evening I was chatting with Erik and he pointed out how this was like renewing our wedding vows.  I told him I hadn't thought of it that way and when I told Dom he said he had and he wished he had said it at the time.  Erik said I should thank Dom for reminding me to love honor and obey and I was quick to point out that I had most definitely, deliberately NOT said obey when we got married.  He quickly took the wind out of my sails by saying that "said or not you have been living it haven't you?"  I have to admit I can see a lot of things in myself, a lot of my behaviors were submissive.  Now that my eyes have been opened.  I have to say that none of this would have been possible without Erik.  He saw the submissive in me and he drew her out.  And when confronted by her husband, he was willing to share her with him.  He has acted as a go between for us on more than one occasion, shedding a little insight for the other of us.  And I certainly can't downplay our relationship.  He is my cyber knight in shining armour.  Hopefully one day I'll get the chance to thank him in person.  For now I have to content myself with chat and email.  I'm still trying to get up my courage to call him.  I have a feeling that his voice will be just as seductive as his written word.  I'm afraid he'll have me doing a lot more than wearing my collar in public before I realize what I'm doing, just because he wants me to.  (and please don't get any ideas guys, I'm not ready to take this public in my home town yet)  I'm still scared.  Nervous.  Excited.  But also strangely calm.  My collar is a lot heavier chain than I usually wear yet it feels so natural I've forgotten I was wearing it for most of the day.  It seems like it's always been there.    I've spent most of my internet time the last few days perusing a  urlLink website  that is loaded with cuffs and collars and costumes and toys.  Making a wish list.  I am trying to be realistic and only put on it things I really think I would wear or use.  I've still found 3 different collars.  One is attached to a breast binder set, the other is very functional and has matching wrist and ankle cuffs.  Looking at this set I started imagining how easy it would be to tie me up.  All the different ways, all the different places.  Made me hot.  The other set is a more discreet leather choker with matching wristbands.  It definitely looks kinky, but it's not so bold you couldn't get away with it in public without more than a couple of looks.  Especially clubbing or hanging out with the freaks.  And that doesn't even touch on the toys I'd like.  *sigh*  I did put one flogger on my list because it looks very similar to the one Mike of  urlLink Sweetness Follows  bought recently.  I've been intensely curious and a little jealous of their stories about this magical flogger.  Especially the teasing uses.  Should I detail some of the spankings, scenes gone wrong and floods of tears since the last post?  Should I tell about the Icee Hot incident?  The last couple of weeks have honestly been a blur.  I couldn't even tell you when what happened without looking back at IMs with Erik and questioning Dom.  I hope it's just the emotions of it all and not my memory going on the fritz.  Just a few little quick vignettes and then I'm off to bed.  Like I said, we have talked more than we have in years.  Honest open discussions that sometimes hurt.  And it goes both ways.  I've cried so much I have boxes of kleenex in nearly every room now.  It's been hard but I think it was necessary, very cleansing.  We discussed mistakes, unmet expectations and hurt feelings a lot.  Just days before the end of our 30 day time trial Dom said he was taking away all the rules.  Like that, it was all gone.  It was up to me to come to him with any needs.  Be it a spanking, bondage or just the need to be dominated.  I had to ask for it.  That hurt.  Mostly because he just arbitrarily decided to do that.  After him and Erik both preaching at me how important communication and negotiation was.  I was devastated.  And what made me break down, made me beg was the one rule that I despised the most.  The bathroom rule.  The rule was I had to ask if I could go whenever we were at home.  It was appreciated if I did when we were out, but not required.  So yes, I begged to have at least that much back.  And he gave it to me but with a much stiffer penalty for disobedience.  25 unwarmed up strokes with the hairbrush.  Needless to say I haven't forgotten yet.  I guess to anybody else, this right here should have been a giant red flag.  That I was a sub through and through and I did want to be dominated.  But we both just pushed on, trying to muddle through.  My inner brat continued to make things nearly impossible for Dom and she kept me from getting what I wanted too.  I couldn't even tell you how many times she ruined a scene.  How frustrated and hurt she made Dom.  She even kept me from Erik.  Dom found an  urlLink article  that he felt described me to a T.  I have to agree.  As much as it spooks me to see myself described so accurately by someone who doesn't know me.  There are a couple of small things that aren't exactly me.  But I'd say it's 95 to 98% me.   I've had several spankings, including one Sunday night that started out as just me wanting to be held.  I wanted to be across his lap because that's where I feel safe and subby.  He knew I wanted more than just to be held but made me ask for it.  I wound up asking for a taste of the hairbrush and did cry a bit.  But it wasn't a good hard cleansing cry.  I hadn't been able to do that for several days.  While he was holding me afterwards I kind of chuckled and when he asked why I told him I guess that counted as the 20 swats Erik said I deserved for using the word begone in a sentence.  When Dom said oh no it didn't I protested that I thought he was just meaning a little light hearted swatting, not a beating, and besides.  I had just had a lot more than 20.  Dom wasn't buying it and told me to get on my hands and knees.  I did, still protesting and not expecting what I got.  20 really hard licks with the leather paddle.  I was crying so hard I could barely call out the required I'm sorry after each lick before he was half way done.  It hurt so bad and when he was done I just collapsed.  When he said something about me testing him to see if he would still love me after punishing me (or something, I really am not sure, I was crying too hard) I literally squeaked out that I wasn't testing him.  It was all I could do to squeak.  He assured me that I was, whether I realized it or not.  I got my cleansing cry and he held me for a few minutes til I stopped crying.  Then he rolled over, just a few inches away.  After a couple of minutes I started crying again.  I felt lonely and abandoned.  I told him I felt abandoned when he asked what that was, what was that new feeling.  He is so good at reading me that I don't know how he can say he isn't a mind reader.  For some reason this made him so proud.  He says I'm developing that ability to read him, that connection.  Because he was just thinking, right when I kind of gasped and started shaking and crying again, that he really should get up and go in the other room.  He says that is what you are supposed to do after a punishment.  Give the punishee a little separation, a chance to think about the punishment and why it was given.  I have to admit, if that really is what he was thinking right then, that's darn spooky.  Not that I doubt him.  It's just, weird.  God.  I'm rambling.  That's what 5 hours of sleep last night and 2 whiskey and Cokes gets me.    If anybody, just one person, is interested enough in hearing about the Icee Hot incident to email me or leave a comment, I'll tell it.  Otherwise I'll just pick up with new stories when I have another to share.

      If you ever wonder why Anna seems so confused sometimes, look no further than me.  I've been hooked on Darvacet for years. A year ago after a severe accident I got access to not only more Davacet, but Lortab as well. And I got hooked on mixing them.  When all this came out about Anna. I swore to quit. I have to be the best man I can be for her. And that means being there for her. Especially when she wants someone's love. No way I can be doped up in those moments for her anymore. I weaned myself as best I could and then it's been cold turkey. It's hell. And it has become hell on both of us. I've been able to manage the body pain, the shaky feeling and the cravings. But the place I have been losing this battle is the most important one. In my mind.   When I go into withdrawals, I get really paranoid. I say things I don't mean or think. I do things I don't mean to do. I break my word. This inconsistently is hurting my relationship to Anna, it's hurting her budding self esteem as A SUBMISSIVE, and it's hurting the chances I have of winning her love again. It has to come to a screeching halt. Now. NOW goddammit now.  I've shut down my other blog. I'm going to focus on this undistracted. And the biggest part of that focus must be to shut the hell up. I've got some new herbs to use to help ease the symptoms. I have a new plan for at home, and I have a new job to help keep me busy. I'm going to beat this. Nothing is more important to me than Anna. Nothing. And I am going to become the man she wants and needs no matter how much discomfort the changes make in me.  What kills me is that Anna put a whole new level of trust in me. So much so I had to go hide and shed a tear of joy, then this comes up and I talk trash for 3 hours in the middle of the night. Shame? You bet. Guilt? Truckloads? Giving up? NOT ON YOUR SOUL!  I'm going to beat this. But I'm not going to be one for much talking until I do. I've needed help. I've wanted to talk to other dom's and sub's and get to learn things to make me a better man suited for Anna. But no one ever responded to the emails I sent. Like the Titanic, my s.o.s has gone unheard, and I did not sink.  Now I have this hurdle to cross, and I will not sink. I will win. But don't expect to hear much from me about it. At least not until it's over but good.

      Instead of a chronicle of all the depravity I've enjoyed this week I thought I might try something different.  Trying to write about feelings.  Specifically my feelings.  I've hinted and danced around the edges of them occasionally.  Inferred things.  But I rarely come right out and bare my soul.  If this gets too difficult I'll stop.  Or divulge my perversions.  I thought I would try though.  I've been suffering the last week.  Feeling really bad about myself and not able to enjoy the new sensations and relationships I've been exploring.  I think it started with a medical problem, was exacerbated by pms and fed by my own unwillingness to stop the pity party.  You see, as painful as it is for me to admit, it's easy and comfortable to feel sorry for myself.  I've had a hard life dammit and everybody should feel sorry for me.  But no one does.    Instead I've got a husband, an online lover, a work crush and an email friend telling me how wonderful I am.  How passionate.  How beautiful.  How brave and daring and erotic.  Only I didn't want to hear it.  I wanted to wallow in my own flaws and shortcomings and not see or acknowledge these other things.    I couldn't see my beauty for the extra weight I carry.  And yet I'm constantly told by those few (count them on one hand few) who know my weight that I don't look that heavy and that I carry my weight beautifully.  We're talking healthcare people.  Professionals who see women of all shapes and sizes and know women's bodies more intimately than most lovers.  The last time I got on the scales at the doctor's office the nurse thought the scales were broken because she said "I don't think this is right, you don't weigh this do you?"  But instead of remembering that and being encouraged by the progress my exercising has brought me (I'm starting to get my waist back again.  I have curves now) all I could do was compare myself to unrealistic and unattainable standards set by people who don't know me or care about me.  I couldn't accept the love these men were trying to give me, each in their own way, because I didn't feel worthy of it.  I didn't feel like I deserved to be loved or desired and couldn't understand how or why any man would want me.  In fact I began to suspect their sanity.  Well, maybe not sanity.  But there must be something wrong with them, for them to want me.  As Groucho Marx put it, "I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member."  I couldn't accept pleasure.  Nothing tasted good, sensual touches left me cold.  Even the pain I have come to crave left me numb.  I wanted to climb into my little hole and shut out the world to keep myself safe from disappointment and rejection.  Pretty pathetic huh?  This morning started on a very sour note.  But I have to give props where they are due.  Instead of just retreating after I shut him out (his usual defense), Dom confronted me.  I broke down and cried, admitting I didn't feel worthy of his love and efforts.  He decided we needed to get out of the house and talk some more.  After a long impassioned talk in the park with Dom, some honest looking at myself in between talking and riding to the next town, and about 3 hours sifting through Books A Million, looking for the self help book that would inspire me, I'm feeling better.  Open, raw, exposed.  But better.  And hopeful.  I know it's not going to be all better, just like that.  However I also know that the decision to make a change, the desire to change, is more than half the battle.    I found 4 books that spoke to me on some level.  One on communication that I hope Dom will read with me.  One on the Womanly Arts of Pleasure-how to find pleasure in yourself and your world and how to use that to get what you want.  One on body acceptance.  And one on breaking the addiction to misery.  I'm not sure I'm addicted to misery, but a random sampling of the text found more than one passage that hit so close to home it moved me to tears.  So I took that as a sign I could benefit from the book.    I'm going to read and re-read.  Highlight and underline.  I've already started writing out index cards with quotes and affirmations.  I intend to use these tools to springboard to self love and confidence.  The conventional wisdom is that you can't love another or accept love from another until you love yourself.  And I want to be loved.  And wanted.  And accepted.  And celebrated.  I crave these things.  Now I'm searching for the path to getting them.  What does all this have to do with being submissive?  A lot I think.  All this muck got stirred up when I began exploring my submissive side.  I've dealt with it before, worked on my esteem.  But not enough.  I didn't pursue it well enough or long enough to find true self love and respect.  You can't submit yourself to another if you don't feel you are good enough.  When you feel like garbage, it shows.  And nobody wants garbage.  Nobody wants to dominate a worthless person.  Not anybody that has any business doing it anyway.  A Dom who uses a sub's lack of self respect, who manipulates that sub and wrings their submission from them based on their feelings of self hate, is a true bastard.  Regardless of sex.  Male or female.  I think it's very likely that any submissive feelings I have had in the past got shoved down along with the other things I've suppressed for so long.  I didn't recognize them for what they were but I didn't try to explore them either.  So it makes sense that when I tried to tap into the submissiveness I stirred up the other things.  The self esteem issues and self hate.  And it looks like I'm going to have to deal with them before I can go much further with the explorations of submission.  Now for a little fun stuff.    Last Sunday's experimentation.  After I posted we retired to the bed to see how we liked having sex while I was on my period.  Something we never tried before but I was intensely curious about.  We put down a towel and got down to business.  Plain vanilla sex, but speaking for myself, I was aroused to try something so different.  Until we got into things.  One thing I didn't even consider and really wasn't prepared for was odor.  Blood has a very distinctive smell and since I was bleeding fairly good, I could smell my blood.  I have rarely been exposed to this odor and in this setting it was a bit unsettling.  I couldn't help but be a little turned off and wonder if Dom was too.  I guess I should have thought about it, but most of my periods are spent keeping blood from ever seeing the light of day so I just wasn't prepared.  We still managed to have good sex, orgasms all around.  Hopefully it was just bad timing, my painkiller wearing off and not the activity itself, but my cramps came back with a vengeance right after.  I wasn't inspired to want to spend the afternoon this way, but I'm certainly not crossing it off my list for the future.  This month was particularly horrible and other months I have been hornier than a goat.  So I predict this will become part of our stable of tricks.   Tuesday evening I worked out in the nude for Dom.  Lifted weights for him to be exact and since I have been doing aerobic workouts lately and neglecting this routine, it hurt.  Not that night but the next few days.  I'm just now able to walk without hobbling.  He really really liked this performance.  I did it because I knew he wanted me to and because I really needed the workout.  Trying here.  I'm trying to do things he likes to express my submission even when I don't love doing it.  It's hard but in this case it was gratifying.  Wednesday we went to the river and watched a rain shower go over while we talked.  This is where the esteem thing got brought up again and Dom told me, without coming out and saying the words, that he thought this was why I couldn't get aroused or get into my headspace.  Much more was said, many tears shed.  But I felt good afterwards.  He put thumbcuffs on me for the ride back to town.  That was, different.  I guess the best word I could come up with for the way it made me feel is reassured.  Thursday was a royal screwup that I won't go into, other than to say there were hurt feelings on both sides but we came to a little better understanding of where I am right now.  Last night.  Last night we tried something I've been wanting for a while but we haven't been able to find the time.  We did this once or twice a long time ago and I really enjoyed it.  Which doesn't make sense because I'm a tad claustrophobic.  I was wrapped up in plastic wrap from shoulders to ankles, blindfolded and had on sound blocking headphones.  Dom got me set up and laid out on the bed and said he'd check on me in 30 minutes.  Those 30 minutes seemed like 5.  I was flying so high and my mind was racing, thinking about things that I've recently experienced, things I want, I couldn't even tell you what my thoughts were.  My feet were unwrapped and hanging off the end of the bed and this with the tightness of the wrap made me feel like I was literally floating in space.  When he checked on me my blindfold got knocked aside.  He misunderstood my problem, thinking I could see too much with the blindfold on and put a bandana around my eyes.  I couldn't communicate for the duct tape gag and tell him all I wanted was the blindfold pulled back into place.  The messing around my head tensed me up and it took a few minutes to get back to where I was.  But I did and floated again until he checked on me again.  This time I tried to communicate that I was ready to stop but he misunderstood and left me.  I thought he was getting things ready to release me when instead he was getting the baby monitor set up so he could go in the other room.  I finally used my safe word signal and got released.  It was an intense situation but no harm was done.  I didn't really panic and enjoyed the whole thing immensely.  I'm looking forward to the next trip.  Tomorrow is family time, going to a family reunion with my folks.  I'm taking off Monday and we have tentative plans for a marking.  He thinks my butt is too pale I guess.  He said last night I was overdue for one.  And that's where I am right now.  Still trying.  Still struggling.  But now that I've been honest with myself and have named my enemy, my self hate instead of myself or my husband, I have hope.  Hope that I'll become worthy of the love and attention the men in my life seem determined to shower me with.  Hope that I'll become the flirty, sexy, confident woman I know I can be.  Hope.

      I have another blog where I cronicle most of what I consider the important events of my life.  As a result it tends to revolve around my pursuite of sex.  It is responcible for my meeting Precious.  I try to respond to everyone that leaves a coment with an email, to thank them for letting me know they are reading my thoughts memories and experiences.  This blog is responcible for my meeting Precious online.  She left a comment to which I responded and she responded to my responce.  The thing you become imediately aware of when you exchange email with Precious is her intellegence.  Her imagaination is the thing that strikes you next.  Shes got a heart as big as you can imagine.  I find her compelling in ways that are hard to describe.  She hasn't been feeling well, and that wears on all of us.  I was talking to one of the woman I am involved with and it reflected to something with Precious.  This woman calls me Daddy while we play.  I was putting her thru a very rough scene, and I asked her if she remembered her safe word.  She told me yes, her safe word was Daddy.  She trusted me to know her better than she knows herself.  The very first time Precious and I played I realized that she trusted the same way. That trust is why I call her Precious.  Sometimes I just need someone else to put it into words.

      My favorite read right now is a blog called  urlLink A Slave's Journey . This woman has an incredible ability to express thoughts and feelings that I find absolutely erotic and exciting.  So naturally I got upset when I read this post:  "~~~I really, really hate it when someone reads this journal and then links it to one of their entries where they then proceed to proclaim how disgusting this is and how I have no self-esteem and blah, blah, blah. But I hate it even more when I realize the person's only 13 1/2."  Boy that steams me. That kid needs to be parentally disciplined first of all for being where he has no business. But his parents are like most I see around here and don't care.  Now not only is young woman a beautiful writer, she is a beautiful woman. If you have read my posts as all, (See 'Don't Knock the Big Girls') Then you know my type. I have no shame in that and I hope she has no embarrassment by it. I think she is very pretty, and the combination of her looks and writing brings me back to her blog over and over.  I really hated to see that she's ended her blog, especially on such a bad note. I have high hopes she can start again, or another one sometime soon. In the meantime, I'm still trying to catch up on all her other entries.  I wanted to make this post because 1) I've been planning to plug this  urlLink blog  for over a week, and haven't had the time and 2) I HATE to see someone get kicked when they are down, I don't care who they are, but especially someone as talented and gifted, and passionate as this blogger is. Good luck girl! You do have a cheering section!

      Anna finally said she was ready to get the punishment she had coming. 25 strokes with a hairbrush.  Had I been in a charitable mood I might have warmed her up just a bit, I tend to do that even for punishment situations. I wasn't in a charitable mood however. I laid into her without mercy, even going as far as to flick my wrist for that maximum "POP" you get with hardwood on soft tissue. She squirmed and cried but I did not relent.  When it was over I reminded her what it was for. How hurt I had been over the infraction, and told her all well again and that she was a good girl. I also reminded against carrying excess guilt around of things that have been past forgiven. I stroked her a few minutes and sent her on her way.  As of this posting she hasn't looked at me or spoken to me. I'm either really good or really bad at what I do, I figure.

      This actually happened nearly 2 weeks ago.  But it was a wonderful experience that I felt like sharing.  Since I don't feel like talking about anything else right now.  It was Monday the 26th of July.  I don't recall why, if there was a reason.  But I asked to be flogged.  And I wanted to test a theory about butt plugs and subspace.  It seemed like the simple act of inserting a butt plug could push me into or very near subspace.  I had asked for one while I watched t.v. a few days before, just for something different.  When I knelt on the bed and Dom prepared me and put it in, I was transfixed.  Couldn't move, could only respond in monosyllables.  It was very odd and a little unsettling.  It happened again the previous Saturday night, turning what was supposed to be simple vanilla sex into something else.  Back to the story.  At dusk Dom took me into the gym and had me bend over the massage table so he could do the plug.  Then tying a wide strip of leather over my eyes, he guides me to the corner post of the power rack.  Instead of tying my hands to the bar across the top he ties them together in front of me, but around the post.  I'm restrained but much more comfortable than if I was tied with my hands over my head.  Laying a larger piece of leather around my neck to protect it and not restraining my feet he tells me what I'm to do when I need a break or want to stop.  Instead of my usual safewords he tells me to say Please Master, have mercy.  In my mind I scoff, thinking it sounds cheesy.  But I commit the words to memory nonetheless.  Taking my favorite flogger, a leather one with wide falls, he begins teasingly flipping it against my back.  Slowly, back and forth, starting at my shoulders and going in equal rows down my back, across my bottom, down my thighs to nearly my knees.  Then back up, the same methodical way.  Each pass gets a little harder.  He does a remarkable job keeping the blows spaced out and not hitting the same place over and over.    Before long I hear the rain start, striking the window air conditioner.  The room is dark with only the street light from across the street coming in the window and a light from another part of the house alleviating the worst of the shadows.  Even blindfolded I'm aware of the amount of ambient light.  It's very hard to block out all light with an ordinary blindfold so I could see around the bottom of it a little.  The only way to completely block out all light with a blindfold is to put pads over closed eyes and then the blindfold.  I can't tolerate that myself, nor can I handle even the thought of a full hood.  I'm a tad claustrophobic and even thinking about it makes me queasy.    I say all that to say that I am aware of the lightning when it starts, even before we can hear the thunder.  The rain is steady, not terribly hard, but hard enough to hear over the air conditioner.  The thunder draws close, not savage and frightful.  Just rumbly.  Reassuring.  A typical southern summer thunderstorm.  But it adds the perfect embellishment to the scene taking place inside.  I feel cocooned inside the rain and thunder.  It helps draw me deeper and deeper inside myself, into the delicious pain of the flogger thudding rhythmically on my back and legs.  I sway into it when he changes position, seeking it when it's withdrawn for a moment.  Moaning with the pleasure/pain of it.  Even when he starts putting some muscle into his blows and I am clutching the post I'm not moving too far away from the flogger's caress.  I grind my forehead into the post as a brace.  (No bruise showed up but my forehead was sore for days)  I didn't expect to take as much as I did, this wasn't about punishment or cleansing my soul.  It was about sensation.  Pain.  Love from my Dom.  But everything combines perfectly to keep me in place until suddenly the pain becomes a burning.  My whole back especially and to a lesser degree my bottom and legs, feel like they are on fire.  And I can't take anymore.  I break into tears.  Sobbing, I speak the words, begging my Master for mercy.  Only when I say it, it doesn't feel cheesy.  It feels right.  At that moment he is my Master, in a way I haven't felt before.  He drops the flogger immediately and steps behind me, surrounding me with his arms and his body and gently guides me to my feet.  I had slid down the post, nearly to the floor by this point.  Holding me close and murmuring to me he unties my hands and guides me down the hall to the bed.  I collapse across the end of it and curl into him when he joins me, crying long and hard.  He holds me, pets me, soothes me with quiet words.  I couldn't tell you what he said.  Likely it was words of love and pride, telling me I was his good girl.  That's what he usually says at times like that.  When the storm of tears passes I ask him to take the plug out and he does; it hurts coming out.  I curl up on his side of the bed, close to the window so I can listen to the rain a little longer.  That's my flogging story, hope you enjoy it.

      Instead of trying to come up with different words to describe my reaction to the events discussed in Violated, I'm going to post part of an email I sent Dom the day after it happened. I told him I needed some time to process what happened and decide how I felt about it all. I didn't realize when I said it how that sounded to him. I didn't realize the anxiety my silence was causing. It's just my way. I rarely react to something right away. I have to process, think, let it settle into my mind and see where it goes. I know he thinks I  think  too much sometimes. And I do, sometimes. But it's just how I am.  Here's the email I sent him (with a little editing and his permission, btw)...    To Dom 7/28/04 Ok. I'll tell you what I've sorted out so far. A large chunk of it was me being embarassed. Humiliated is actually the better word. And so wrung out I couldn't move to take care of myself much less you and I couldn't stop you from caring for me. That in itself is hard for me to handle but when you consider what you were doing for me, well. It was difficult to say the least. I have never had to have someone clean me up like that since I was a very young child. Even when I had my surgeries and burned my hand I managed that by myself.  Anal sex is very emotionally charged for me for that reason and because it makes me feel so vulnerable and helpless. You know I've always been that way about it and that's a big part of why I didn't want to do it for so long. Just every once in a great while when the need would become overwhelming. I guess that was my submissiveness needing to be fed, even though I had it so completely surpressed, it still was a part of me and still expressed itself.  And to be honest, it was rough and a little painful. I felt used and discarded. Like a sex toy or an object. It didn't really feel like rape and I didn't think that word until you said what you did about coming so hard from raping my ass. I think that may have pushed me into subspace.  When you finished and moved so quickly to clean up I got deeply embarassed. I revere your cock. Because it is part of you and you are my Dom, my Master. I want to worship it, not shit on it. And because you got up so fast I figured it was a real mess and you couldn't wait to get clean. That pushed me further into my headspace.  Then my damned old brain kicked in and I started thinking about what had happened and I'm sure that made me seem distant. If I felt raped. I don't know if there is truly a difference other than in just semantics, but I felt used and a little violated and discarded. But not raped. Even though yes, it did hurt a little and I know that even without intent you could hurt me much more back there than you could during normal sex (not that you couldn't hurt me that way too, but it would be different). I wasn't really afraid of being hurt.  And I started thinking about how I felt about being used like that. My first thought was NO! I don't like it at all. But then I turned off my higher brain and listened to my feelings. And catalogued my body and how it had reacted. I felt more like your possession than I have ever felt. Ever. And I noticed that the dull little ache in my lower belly was still there. Stronger in fact. My cunt was throbbing again.  The little snippet of a fantasy came about a few minutes later. When I guided your hand to see how wet I still was. Or again. If I had truly felt raped or violated in a bad way I would not have done that. I certainly wouldn't have shared my desire and asked you to act it out. Do you really think I could have let you spank me that hard if I felt you had done me wrongly? I might have not stopped the scene if I was afraid of you (which is NOT the case, I'm just saying that is a much more likely possibility) but I would never have submitted myself to more pain from you.  I don't think this is something I could handle on a very regular basis. I still struggle with giving up control and this is the ultimate in losing control. I still have a hard time thinking of myself as yours, your possession to use. Last night stretched my limits, a lot. That's not necessarily a bad thing. But after Monday night it was a bit overwhelming.  Frankly, I don't think I could have handled it, maybe not at all but certainly not as well as I have, if I hadn't had Monday night. I know I haven't said a lot about it but it was pretty amazing. I didn't think I could take that much, not yet. And I'm kind of proud of myself. The buttplug helped, I think, but I was in subspace most of the time and when I asked you to stop I genuinely felt the words I said. They sounded silly when you told me to use them but I felt like you were my master and I wanted to beg for your mercy when I did it. So thank you. It made me feel very submissive and very much yours. That made what happened Tuesday night easier to handle.      Now, as to the other part of the post. The name called out. *sigh* If I dreamed, I don't recall it. Which is too bad, really. Yes, the crush does feed some need in me. Deep inside, I'm a very needy little girl, always looking for male approval. As an adult, this approval comes in the form of attraction, sexual interest, flirting. Sometimes it's as simple as an admiring second glance.  When it was pointed out to me that a certain person had more than an occasional second glance for me, it turned my head. It made me look at him with new eyes. It made me feel good, feel feminine and attractive. At a time when things were troubled at home. And even now, since we are working on our relationship, it still gives me good feelings. Ones that I'm not ready to give up, selfish as that is.  I'm still unsure of myself in my new role and our relationship isn't completely patched up yet. So I cling to the "crush" and the feelings he inspires. I don't fantasize about him much anymore. My physical hunger for him has abated somewhat. More because of the intrusion of reality than anything else. He hasn't done anything untoward, made no passes, not told any leading, off-color jokes that could lead to a provocative discussion or encouraged me in any blatant way.  But his reaction to Dom's appearance at work one day was rather telling. Indicating the presence of some kind of inappropriate feelings or at least thoughts. You don't act as guilty as he did without reason. In fact, his reaction made Dom wonder if we had actually  had  something physical. Of course we haven't. I suspect it would take a very direct move on my part for that to happen. And even then, well, I don't totally believe he would take me up on it. He has a lot to lose if we got caught or things went badly between us. More than I do.  Maybe that's why he keeps things as they are. Maybe it's because he doesn't want me, he just feels affection for me. Maybe he does want me but is too much of a gentleman to ask me to risk my marriage. Maybe he doesn't want to risk his own. I suspect I'll never know the truth. But that's ok too. For now, his attention is enough to fulfill that need in me. Maybe someday, when I'm more self assured, more confident in my submission or just able to love myself, maybe then I won't need his attention and his implied approval it brings. Maybe.

      Spose about a lot of things.  Lot of people I think wonder about the relationship that the three of us must be developing.  Hard to explaine and make sense.  But I am going to try.  First you have to look at the relationship that both Eben and I have with Anna.  Thought about it long and hard and boiled it down to a single word.  Cherish.  Not the sort of cherish like your great aunts china.  The sort of cherish where two grown and dominate men can find time and enough in common in order to help someone grow.  Anna and Eben are talking about their collaring experiment now.  Renegotiating as it were.  There have been many triumphs and many minor victories.  To my mind nothing has defeated them as a couple, or us as a poly.  For my view, I hope that they decide not to have Anna wear the collar full time.  I do hope that they can sit down and calender out a schedual of scene's that are hot and leave Anna the strength to blog about it.  (Thats the real reason for the lack of posts lately to my mind.  By the time she recovers Eben's ready to swing the flogger again.)  I find myself wrapped up between the two of them, friend and lover to Anna, friend and coconspiritor to Eben, and always acting as D/s Marriage Councilor.  I know that they are both happier than they have been in years despite the ups and downs that they have had in the last few months.  Espcially when they remember that their souls are much more fragile to words than their bodies are to a little slap and tickle.  Sometimes I think I should step aside and that I am an unfair influence in their lives.   Then one or the other will reach out to me, unsure needing advice, or more often someone that will listen.  There have been times in the past I have reached out to one or the other for their moral support.  I know members of my family would scowl that I can turn to these people that I have never met.  Thats the thing though, I know with out a doubt that I can count on them for a good and nonjudgemental word because that is what I offer as well.  Hoping that that makes the sence out of it I feel cause after a long sober time thinking about it thats the best I can come up with.
