      Put your arms around her waist and whisper in her ear Make her feel wanted every chance you get  Hold her close when she's cold  When you are alone hold her close and kiss her Kiss her on the tip of her nose  (it will give her the hint that you want to kiss them)  While in the movie, put your arm around her  and then she will automatically put her head on your shoulder,  then lean in and tilt her chin and kiss her lightly  When she complains that her neck/ shoulders hurts massage it for her  When people diss her stand up for her  Look deep into her eyes and tell her you love her Lay down under the stars and out her head on your chest so she can listen to the steady beat of your heart,  Link your fingers together while you whisper to her  as she rests her eyes and listeHey guys, this is how you should treat your girlfriends...
