      Is the internet the truest democracy we've seen?    I listened to a group of students a few months back argue that the internet should be UNmonitored, based on the idea that the net constitutes a true democracy. Alas, as much as their position struck a chord with my quasi-idealistic side, their argument was partially flawed.    Yes, seemingly, lepers, Palestinians, Israelis, the transgendered, children, the disabled, high school nerds and prom queens and kings are all equal on the net, so yes, the net is a powerful equalizer, yet, if we hope to continue to use the internet productively, it cannot be left entirely to its own devices.  Someone must attend to the practical matters of assigning domain names, which is done somewhat democratically, albeit mysteriously, as far as I know.  And while at first glance the internet may seem anarchic, it is becoming more governed by the day.  Interestingly, in part by the  urlLink Internet Society , a transparent and democratic organization.  Yes, you too, can have your say regarding the inner workings of the internet.  I just joined the Society (couldn't someone have come up with a better name?).  It's free.    Of course, we all know that while democracy is a beautiful thing, it's implementation is usually imperfect.  Some argue that democracy is not always a good thing for any country at any given time.  Initially, as an American, I was baffled by this viewpoint, which is trumpted by  urlLink Dr. Fareed Zakaria  in his book The Future of Freedom (if you get the audio book version, I recommend skipping cd one, at least if you're driving and planning to stay awake - luckily, the book progressively improves).    I guess what I'm pondering here is just how democratic a thing is the internet?  And will the net's democratic nature hinder it as its user population, a population with greatly divergent paradigms, grows?

      People + Technology = [insert buzzword of choice].  Nothing new there.  Yes, yes, bring on the cadre of platitudes.  Think like the end user.  Design with the user in mind.  Simplicity.  Minimalism.      Okay, yes, these are important, and often harped, concepts.  But do we really know how the end user thinks?  Or, perhaps more importantly, why the end user thinks in the manner that he or she does?  And, putting on your future thinking cap for just a moment, consider the multitudes of "types" of users gaining access to computers and the internet for the first time.  Tech companies may soon find need to woo additional cultures and markets in order to keep their books in the black.   The internet is the major engine enabling globalization, but what will globalization do to the internet?  429 million people are online globally.  That's only 6% of the world's population.  41% of those 429M are in the US and Canada.  As more Chinese and more Liberians come online, how will the fabric of the internet change?  As cultures gain "usage parity" how will internet norms concerning social and business transactions change discussion boards and ecommerce?  How will government policy toward commerce and free speech impact the internet?  And what will Google do?         How drastically do GUI usability concepts vary from culture to culture?  Is it possible to compare and contrast interface usability concepts of sophisticated users with those of non-computer-literate peoples in the developing world?   Does lack of access to the internet constitute a new type of informational poverty? How can folks who cannot read learn to use computers and the web?  How can technology be ethically and responsibly introduced to the populations of developing countries?  A fortune cookie I once enjoyed told me, "You are what you think about."  I guess I'm mainly part ether, part human and part keyboard, among sundry other things.  Obviously, I don't have answers to all the above questions/ponderings.  And I imagine trying to discern those answers should keep me occupied for quite a time.

      Just read a Blogger note - entitled "So Farsi So Good" on the blogger dashoard/log-in page - to the effect that blogging gives Iranian women an outlet:   "'Take one exasperated Iranian woman. Add a computer. Hook it up to the internet. "And you have a voice in a country where it's very hard to be heard ..."' Nice! Maybe that should be in our tour."   The idea is so interesting and profound.  Will Iraqi women soon be blogging, er, when they have electricity?  So, I checked out the  urlLink article   posted on a Persian website.  Feeling dumb tonight, so I won't attempt to write anything on the article, save that it's interesting.  Below is one excerpt that is on topic:   "Thousands of Iranian blogs have cropped up since late 2001 when an Iranian emigre in Canada devised an easy way to use the free blogging service Blogger.com in Farsi. Though several English blogs outside Iran are read by Iranians, the most popular ones are in Farsi and operated inside the country."  The question that initially popped into my mind after seeing the article's title was how secure these women feel in their anonimity when publishing blogs.  I also thought about the effect that the ability to effortlessly publish political fare on the net will have on government.    One last reflection for tonight.  Would it not be lovely to live in a world in which customer self-service credit/debit card processors (the grocercy store and deparment store variety) were standarized?  Ah, to automatically push the correct button and swipe my card in the correct direction - and in the correct order - without thinking!

      Can blogs be copyrighted?  Which browsers are people using to access the internet?  How do browsers shape the way people experience the internet and interact with others?  How do browsers shape the way we access and think about information?    Is the internet propelling the expansion of a global subculture - one that is equally foreign to all of us?  The skill with which one Uses the internet varies based on multiple factors (what are those factors?).  How does one identify different user groups (seems as if the matrices of location, sex, age are inadequent?)?  And how does one go about tackling the concept of user groups?  Some of the reasons why the interent is more intuitive to some groups (comp sci majors, for instance) are are obvious, but what about the less obvious reasons?    How predominate is the English language among internet and software pioneers?    Who defined usability norms?      Why does everyone in the world, seemingly, interact with computers by means of a just a handful of user interfaces (and keyboards)?  Okay, one standard design is cheaper to produce and maintain, but what about minor design modifications that would, ostensibly, open up larger markets to software companies?  Pros, cons?     Where can I do Ph.D. that will start to address these questions?    Will I ever readjust to EST?

      IE sucks.  Would someone please come up with a way to retrieve, post-crash, text that has been entered in fields?  - Mandarian characters - are they more ardous to input? - ramifications for the ditigal divide - will the web make English even more ubiquitous?  - mental proccesses - difference in writing Mandarian for the web and in transferring print Mandarian to web Madarian  - bermuda ebusiness (a file on the site had a virus, Norton aborted it taking with it my blog entry, fueling my tech rage and resulting in this abbreviated entry in outline format) - further reaching implications for business on the web - changing corporate structures and physical locations  In short, my trip to China was phenomenal     (some of my pics are on webshots  urlLink http://community.webshots.com/user/merebartlett ).  The more I learned about China, the more questions were raised in my mind.  It's a fascinating place - even more so as it is in the throws of sweeping change.  I didn't have much time to learn about how the Chinese use computers and the internet.

        Forgive the political roll I'm on lately. Politics are so closely related to tech that it would be almost impossible to manipulate millions of people without tech!     Joe Trippi is back blogging at his site,    urlLink   http://www.joetrippi.com/     , though he hasn't updated  urlLink his personal blog  for a couple of weeks.      I laughed, I cried and I probably twitched a bit, too, watching the raw, behind the scenes look at the Dean campaign CNN aired this past winter. Actually, it was one of the best pieces of journalism I've  ever  witnessed.  I remember Joe downing lots of Diet Coke.      Well, there on his site is a bit about OpenCola. Open source food. I like it! I can't get opencola.org to come up (probably getting major hits right now), but I think, after reading the English translation of the  urlLink Japanese OpenCola  write-up, I prefer anyway:          Making soft drinks is not for the faint of heart, nor the dirty of finger. It is a solemn enterprise not to be entered into lightly, as with marriage or buying used farm machinery...   No one's putting a gun to your head, so don't bother if you can't boil water. Improper use of cola might result in blunt trauma, puncture wounds, physical illness, mental illness, caffeine dependency, dental necrosis, acid reflux, death, devastation, and random tax audits.        Actually, I think openCOLA is a search engine company that fell into some financial trouble.

         Just a couple of thoughts relating to the DNC convention I'm half-watching tonight (will be watching attentively when Kerry takes the stage, though).     Say, how is it that Madeline Albright has managed to look exactly the same for more than ten years?       I'm very tempted to call into C-Span and ask them why they haven't talked with any of the DNC bloggers (here are two related sites:  urlLink ConventionBloggers.com  and  urlLink CyberJournalist.net )   or at least I haven't seen blog coverage from C-Span. Will there ever be a day when C-Span links us to the blogs of politicos? It seems worthy of at least a mention, right? Or do they think that bloggers are threatening their turf?     Some bloggers are distressed by big media congloms entering the blogosphere.  I say it's a free world  . I understand that this breed of handsomely paid, media-celebs-cum-bloggers are stealing the thunder of bloggers. Yes, the very essence of blogging is having an independent voice, a voice outside the banalities and slantedness of established media outlets, but there's room for all kinds of bloggers.  There are 120 bloggers with credentials at the DNC.   There's even a  urlLink blogger  covering all the blogging.       CNN   is blogging the DNC.  Greta Van Susteren at  urlLink Fox  is also blogging.

        [opted for courier today, given the subversive yellow-journalism-esque content]    Did you know...      You can donate gmail invitations to American troops serving overseas?  This is legit.  Check out  urlLink http://www.isipp.com/gmail4troops/    .     You can search for books (great for textbooks!) by price at   Chambal.com  .  This search engine compares prices from all major, as well as some of the lesser known, online bookstores.        There are some google and gmail haters out there. Since google is the darling of the internet, as well as its most popular global gateway, everything about google, from it's corporate motto of "Don't Do Evil" to it's algorithm, is worthy of zealous inspection. Come to think of it, google must know more about me than my mother. As we all know, most anytime you sign up for something free, there's a catch. Apparently google can keep your gmails on file until the end of internet time. Does that also apply to incoming email? I would guess that they can keep incoming emails, too. And although I don't know much about this, they have some sort of weird cookie thing that has been causing quite a stir. I understand why people, wiser than me, would raise objections.       However, I find that some of the objectors are more "spooky" (which is the preferred parlance of the objectors when discussing how gmail matches email content with advertising) than gmail's happy-go-lucky (non)privacy policy. For instance, check out this   denunciation of gmail   at gmail-is-too-creepy.com (note the .com istead of .org).  Now check out their   creepy staff page  .  They gotta be working for ping-happy MSN.    I think one of the better commentaries on the subject comes from Brad Templeton, who has worked as a consultant for google, collects revenue from google's Adsense program and is a Chairman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.      urlLink His Privacy Subtleties of Gmail  is fair and balanced (a phrase I now hesitate to use).    I wandered upon another google doodad this week,  urlLink Google Compute , which is google's way of encouraging distributed computing for a scientific cause. Compute allows users to install an application that works on a complex project, currently Stanford Uni's  urlLink Folding@home  project, which is trying to answer the question "What are proteins and why do they 'fold'?"        In my feeble head, this seems a worthy cause, plus you get this cool double helix icon on your toolbar (IE only, nuts). Maybe google really is just a do-gooder looking to pick up some mega bucks along the way. If I ever had a company with potential, I would want the same. Of course, I'm kinda unusual that way.     NB: It stikes me that google/Google is doing something else to English... corroding accepted assumptions about capitalization. I don't think this is necessarily evil, but I do find it interesting.

        I spend a lot of time at a cafe in town that has wi-fi, in fact, I'm writing from there right now.  I'm at this place so frequently that it might as well be my office.     I frequented here before they got wi-fi, but now I'm here daily.   A year or so ago, I saw some regulars, but nothing close to the number of familiar faces I now see daily.  So it turns out I'm not the only one who can't work from home.  This place is addictive.  All the coffee you can drink.  All the bandwidth, as far as I know, you'll ever really need.     I don't live in a large city.  This place is far from Silicon Valley, and tech companies are few and far between.  Granted it is a college town, and it has a large medical center, large pharm company and a sizable percentage of international residents, so I suppose it has many of the right elements - meaning that a good chunk of the population is likely to be transient and/or has few familiar ties to this place.         It's started to get a little crowded for my liking.  Seeing the same faces day after day is a bit odd; it's almost like belonging to a club that I never volunteered to join.  My guess is that most of them, like me, are students.  I wonder how packed this place is going to be once the fall term rolls around.    I've read of businesses that rent out cubes to people such as me and provide all the espresso you can drink.  It's an interesting concept, and I imagine it's possible that they make money on the extras such as printing and copying services.  I wonder how soon, or even if, these places will see a profit.  And I wonder if cafes such as this one make money on serial customers who hold tables hostage for hours at a time.  I know they make lots of money off me.  I'd say the true economic impact is difficult to measure, as you would have to determine whether non-lingering customers get feed up with serial customers and stop frequenting places that permit lingerers.

        My exboyfriend is a notorious downloader of     illegal     MP3's. He won't shell out 99 cents for a song but he'll drop 800 bucks on a blazer; he wants to be Tucker Carlson. After we broke up, his father registered the family's pirated (    or of otherwise dubious origins)     software in my name and made sure the computer tumid with stolen tunes was in my name. Well, I suppose if I get busted I could barter my freedom by providing info about [BLEEP].     NB: Turns out my ex reads is a reader. He was not so thrilled about this post, and, in the end, I caved. It's worth it to always have a place to stay when I'm in New York.  Interestingly, he enjoyed be compared to Tucker Carlson and soon plans to invest in a few select bowties.

       Just how usable is the usability literature available on the web, a logical medium for such writings I would think?     urlLink Wikipedia's HCI page  provides a brief intro for the newbie, but I'm looking for an indepth source.  I can't seem to find an exhaustive, yet mildly readable, explanation of how HCI-related ideas, and their respective fields, fit together. I've also searched for a history of usability, only to be told by various  urlLink Google Group Users  that such a volume does not exist.  Cliff   Notes, apparently, doesn't do usability.    If I could find a history, or even survey, of usability, would it be a quick read or a tome? I also checked MIT's Open Course Ware page, where I found some courses that touched upon HCI, but no course entirely geared towards the subject available for public consumption.     There's always the  urlLink ACM library , though it intimidates me, someone who is merely on the periphery of computing (forgive the pun).    It's funny that ACM (still) uses the acronym CHI, in contrast with HCI. Isn't putting the computer first the problem, now that computer time is cheaper than people time?    NB:  I've been compiling a makeshift  urlLink HCI page , with an anthropological focus, on my site.

      "Would you like fries with that?"    Go ahead, laugh, my silly former college comrades.      Anthropology has shaped my thinking.  In fact, my professors taught me how to think, inquisitively and logically.  The discipline taught me how to articulate questions and how to go about answering them.  "So, where are you running off to dig up bones?"    A background in anthropology led to a solid marketing (interlude) career for me, complete with a nice paycheck.  The business stats course I took was a breeze... but I got sick of marketing - sick of selling the services of lawyers.      But, I have to admit, as an anthro undergrad I felt a bit lost.  Academically, I believed there were two questions I needed to answer in order to go on as a student of anthropology, and I did not light upon the answer to either until a few years later.  First off, I didn't know what genre of anthropologist I wanted to be; I didn't know whom or what I wanted to study.  The other question was related to my obsession with usefulness.  What purpose would I be serving as an anthropologist, an outside observer who snooped and then snitched on her subjects?  I desperately needed to have a purpose, one that made sense for me as much as it made sense for the world at large.  In addition to my ethical concerns particular to the field (Chagnon, What did you do?), I had concerns about the long-term viability of anthropology.  The more ethnographies I read, the tighter the knot in my stomach clinched.           The answer to my concerns came by way of a one-word answer:  technology.  Perhaps I'm a late bloomer, as I'm just now awe-struck with my ponderings concerning transcendence of cultures across virtual boundaries.  Or perhaps I'm too early, for when I eagerly expound upon the wonders of the nascent, marvelous internet, colleagues arch eyebrows, dismissing me as another technological determinist, surely poised to lose my shirt on the latest Silicon Valley IPO.    I have but one nagging worry - Will not many anthropologists be forced to become historians quite soon?  And am I not guilty of contributing to this culture-opoly.

      Why did I start this itty bitty blog?    Out of sheer selfish and laziness.    As I suppose is common, I am a visual learner.  I find it deliciously simple to keep track of my files and thoughts online.  And blogging is sort of akin to jotting down notes, but, wait! - look! - like magic, my notes become ordered reverse chronologically.  And, yes (it's too good to be true), they are now readable (as they're not spilled across the pages of multiple pocket-sized notebooks in my schizophrenic scrawl!).    Another reason I blog is that I want some sort of artifact - an active learning document to keep track of my thoughts.  Who knows, there may be an off chance that I would need to retrieve them someday.  Better yet, I don't have to pay to host my thoughts.    I suppose, somewhere in the cobwebby recesses of my mind, I entertained the idea, only for a moment, that I might actually use this silly e-journal to communicate with other people who were interested in similar topics.    I'm not sure that's a main motive.  It would be delightful, but connectivity is not necessary for me in this context.  Some blog for glory, for RSS, for advertising revenue, but not me.  Hmmm... does that make me a prude, then?  Oh right, I was delusional there for a moment, fantasizing that I was popular.  Anyway, you see, I grew up in a small town and have since moved, I believe, 24 times.  'Tis the way of life of a professional student, at least for one who believes you must travel to get a real education, richly experiencing life, savoring exotic tastes and earthy smells.  So, taking into consideration the small town upbringing and the rather apathetic, tight-lipped university where I did my undergrad, somewhere along the way I created this sort of inner life - this constant streaming dialogue with myself (and now I could conceivably be sharing my ramblings with the entire world - strange, eh?).  A lot of people do the same, I mean, lead inner intellectual lives.  No matter how many friends you have, or how head-over-heels in love you are, aren't you alone with your thoughts at the end of the day?  I think the trick is to relish them - to figure out what makes you tick and pursue your inner life with reckless abandon.  And, as a bonus, it's highly unlikely you'll pick up something unsavory, like a std or something, that way.  Life is actually enjoyable when you're content with your person and your thoughts, I think.      Okay, okay... so maybe I started blogging to belong.  Isn't everone else doing it?   P.S.  Strange the words blog and blogging can't be found in blogger's spell check gizmo.

      I have a (bad) habit of googling myself.  It's not that I'm popular by any stretch of the imagination, according to google's all-knowing algorithm, but I do it more to check the pulse of the internet.   And I'm frequently surprised.  I've not scientifically looked at this, mind you, but when I google myself every month or so, I find that the number of pages related to my name have multiplied exponentially - and the sites have nothing to do with me.  Usually, I explain away the jump using my last name, which resides in the gray area of commonality -- common enough that those put-your-family-name-on-a-satchel catalogs periodically show up in my mother's mailbox and uncommon enough to still be mangled by the increasingly rare telemarketer.

      I've been browsing the sites of various usability gurus and their consulting companies over the last couple of months and I've noticed a trend.  Visually-speaking, most of the sites are distressingly dull.  Where's the color?  The marketing savvy?  What's the point of making my commercial site usable if the site isn't the least bit sticky?    I'm dismayed by this.  We've all labored through sites that are visually pleasing at the cost of functionality and vice-versa.  But I expected more from folks who make their living by being usability prophets.  Perhaps some could use a crash-course in marketing. Frumpiness is not necessitated by usability.  Surely there's middle ground between usability and style.    Style is subjective and, though to a lesser extent, so is usability.  Logic tells me there's room for improvement, and, yes, that there is a common ground... now only to find it.

      A couple weeks back I had this idea.  It was not a particularly brilliant idea, but it had some merit.  After updating my unwieldy amazon.com wishlist (btw, is there anything that serves as a better barometer of character?  watch out match.com here comes amazon.com wishlist dating!  i would be in for a serious romantic mishap.), I thought about how handy it would be for everyone to have wishlists.  No more brooding over what to buy friends for birthdays!  I'd just log on to their wishlist.  Viola!    Someone beat me to it.  And that's the case time and time again.  Knowing I'll never have an original idea again is bad enough (the odds are not in my favor -  urlLink 6,442,575,514 people as of 6:33 pm  ), but searching the internet in the hope that perhaps no one has yet put the pen to the paper is usually done in vain.  Inevitably, you discover your unoriginal idea in its full commercialized glory.  The internet serves to remind me, time and time again of my ignorance and gross naivete.  It's not easy claiming residency in cyberland.

      This week, ensconced in a layer of thick humidity sandwiched beneath an emerald canopy and above a mossy carpet, my grandparents started philosophizing about photography.    My grandmother lamented that the photos she was taking would not accurately depict the waterfalls that we were slowing drinking up with our eyes (we were deliberately loafing, considering the steepness and length of the stairway we had to climb to get out of the valley and back to our cars).  My grandfather agreed, but said that sometimes photos can make places appear more grand than they truly are.  It was a delicious moment; and me, the uber dork, took advantage of it and started explaining virtual reality to my grandparents.  I mused that soon we'd be able to (almost) fully experience the sights, sounds, smells and feels of far off places.  I think they got it, but I don't think they much cared.    Of course, I guess I don't much care about my grandparents' work (other than it's relevant to their lives).  And it makes me sad, as sometimes I wish I was interested in something that they could teach me.  It would no doubt mean a great deal to them - to pass some skill or knowledge on to me, but I have no interest in becoming a homemaker like gran nor becoming a math teacher like my grandfather.  And I think they feel useless, knowing that I'm interested in this "new-fangled and mighty expensive" pursuit of technology.    Of course, this little vignette is representative of a larger societal change.  As the old are not as useful to us as they used to be (I know that sounds harsh, but isn't it true?).  It makes me think of the Chinese and how they so revere their elders, presumably, in part, because they believe that they can learn so much from them.  As the Chinese modernize at a dizzying pace, will their traditions stick?       There is a reverse (in regard to age, and thus experience) of the traditional teacher-student (mentor-apprentice or boss/peon) relationship in our society.  What will this mean for our corporate compensation system (in part it means that unqualified but entrenched workers get jobs they have no business getting)?  Certainly we've seen a bzillion start-ups created by young workers.  I think of my own discontent with 9-5 life, and the bureaucratic stupidity that often accompanied it, and I wonder if the traditional Dilbert office worker will soon be an forgotten icon of this generation (we can only hope).   Or perhaps Dilbert will be shipped off to Mauritius?   Here's a dismal related thought - as medicine improves, what happens as our bodies hold out longer?  Will our brains be able to keep pace, or will we walk around like fit and trim, though mindless, vegetables?     P.S.  When I misspell bureaucratic, as I inevitably do, the suggested spelling I'm presented with is "backwards."

      I can't tell you how many times I've thought, "Damn, if only I could find that article about [whatever]."  So, here's my hopelessly impractical idea - an RFID scanner for reading material with a built-in searchable database.    As I've given up the quest for normalcy and have given into my eclectic-clutter-friendly-newspaper-clipping-absent-minded-inner professor, I could really use a personal RFID device for reading materials and notes and such.  Of course, this would require  coding a good chunk of the planet, including internet pages (which might not be such a bad idea).            How long will it be until we (as in humans) are all RFID-friendly?  How does RFID work anyway?  I mean, will we ever run out of workable radio spectrum if RFID becomes as prevalent as our techie determinists say it will?

      just for kicks, thought i'd share my microsoft recommendations.  Leverage Suitable Trends, Contacts & Partnerships    1)  Sell, service and support Linux and Linux-based products.     2)  Allow companies to lease software off-site, hosted and supported 		       	                by Microsoft.    3)  Continue talks with Hollywood studios to provide technology that will curb        movie pirating over the internet.   4)  Continue research into wearable computing products, including the use of          holographic displays.     Reassess Profitability of Segments    1)  Decide whether its too late for MSN to compete with Google (July 1, 2004,        MSN released a new search technology in an effort to compete).  Microsoft        needs to evaluate its cash outlays in this field, although many of the        search utilities that Microsoft develops under the auspices of MSN may        have a second internal life in-house.   2)  Continue to invest heavily in R&D.     3)  Explore expanding consulting business, including entering traditional IT          consulting markets, specifically opportunities that may emerge from the        outsourcing of corporate or governmental IT departments.    Reexamine Marketing Goals & Expenditures   1)  Sales functions seem to be doing well, despite dull marketing.  Reinvigorate brand        image (and revamp images associated with working at Microsoft, i.e. a start-up that no        longer can act like a start-up) and brand with a global, mildly edgy advertising        campaign (the MSN Butterfly campaign is a start).  Marketing department seems to lack        focus, i.e. the brands are controlling the marketers instead of vice versa.   Pay Attention to Global Strategy    1)   Develop better software localization and human-centered design strategies 	   2)   Microsoft must think globally and devise global solutions both for its own         operations and for its customers, now more than ever (perhaps offer global  		       outsourcing of IT functions and global IT consulting) 	   3)   Continue to pressure China and other countries with lackadaisical IP laws         (perhaps pledge to help the Chinese implement the laws for a fee).  Tweak People Practices     1)  Microsoft seems to be doing a good job in regard to its HR functions,            although making the Microsoft brand a bit less stodgy could help attract the           best and brightest technical talent.      2)  Microsoft should implement cross-disciple teams in its R&D efforts (guessing it does,         but not drawing heavily enough on people from the social sciences) and then         reward those who receive patents & inventions by team rather than by individual.           3)  Microsoft should stop being so secretive and promote R&D stars in the press to         generate buzz.     4)  Microsoft should have a clear succession plan in place for when Bill Gates          and Steve Ballmer retire.

      So I find out that blogs can be copyrighted, or at least somewhat copyrighted.  I'll have to do a bit more digging into this.  Wanting to see what the gov has to say, naturally, I visited the U.S. Copyright Office's site and conducted a search for "blog."  I get one hit - a pdf document commenting on a case involving DVD's and CSS.  Not quite what I was looking for.  Seems to be a bit of a time lag between the real world, the government, and, lastly, government-affiliated webpages - shocking.  So then I started thinking about the  Creative Commons logo I saw the other day on a witty, informative blog,  urlLink LawGeek   , and quite a while back on  urlLink Lawrence Lessig's blog  (I actually cited the LawGeek blog in a management paper I wrote today!  That was an enjoyable first.)  I knew a bit about the  urlLink Creative Commons  from  urlLink EFF , though I don't know much at all about IP issues.  After doing some marketing work for two law firms, I developed a severe disinterest in the law.  Still, that doesn't excuse me from being an informed cyber citizen.  I wish I had more time, and I wish I remembered what I read and where I read it.          But the information overload rant is for yet another post.

      In one of my pots a few days/weeks back I complained about IE.  And yesterday, IE's security shortcomings became media fare.  Having quite enough, I went shopping for a new browser.  Enter  urlLink Mozilla's Firefox .  Life will never be the same.  With Firefox's tabs, I can have a seemingly limitless number of pages open at the same time!  I believe this has been the highlight of my week.  I must get out more.  So where's all this anti-Microsoft sentiment coming from?  Actually, I'm not anti-Microsoft.  I think it's going to be great fun to kick back and watch Microsoft squirm.  I had to do an analysis, and a rather pathetic one, of Mr. Softy this week in order to wrap up yet another management course, so I've had open source on the brain for the last week.    I'm a tech idiot (I'm learning, but it's slow going), but I'm seriously thinking about putting  urlLink OpenOffice  and, gasp!, running Linux on my next laptop.  I think there's some significance here - we may be approaching one tipping point (sorry to have to go and through that antiquated buzzword out) for the open source movement.  Given the recent IE news, I imagine others like me, the mildly-tech-inclined, will be throwing in the towel and looking for alternatives.  I'd always know of Mozilla, and a few years ago I think I briefly used a Mozilla browser, but the company's browsers never seemed like a viable alternative for me b/c I always thought I was too stupid to use them.      And, anthropologically speaking, I have recently become fascinated by the open source movement.  Not to get all mushy, but it gives me, almost, hope for the world.  It's really unprecedented, such large groups working together.  How does it all work?  And why does it work?

         urlLink BlogShares:  Fantasy Blog Shares Market   Ha!  I made the list.  Of course, I don't know exactly what kind of list I've managed to make.  All I know is that  urlLink anthrotech  has been holding steady at $1,000 and it's P/E is 1.0.   Buy!  Buy!  Welcome to the world of   BlogShares, which has escaped my attention until just now.  BlogShares is    "a simulated, fantasy stock market for weblogs where players invest fictional money to buy stocks and bonds in an artificial economy where attention is the commodity and weblogs are the companies. ...blogs... are valued by their incoming links from other known blogs. In effect, links become the business deals in the simulation and players speculate on the fortunes of thousands of blogs by buying and selling shares. A whole host of options exist for advanced play including gifting shares, leveraged buy-outs, stock splits, additional share issues, market and player bonds."   Maybe I'll sign up in order to promote anthrotech. It's free, plus I automatically get stock in my own blog (which is nice, yet strangely disconcerting).  I just have two questions.  What constitutes insider trading?  And where is Elliot Spitzer?

        Musings on techlife:  I have started to associate my friends' IM fonts and colors with their personalities. George will eternally be associated with comic sans. I think of Ro and I find her gaudy hot pink AOL background floods my conscious.  I haven't purchased stamps for months.  I very rarely hit print; instead, I am bookmark happy.  Yet my office is far from paperless.  I judge a book by it's Amazon.com page. It takes a leap of faith for me to do business with a company that doesn't have a domain and matching email accounts.  I tried to order pizza online last week, but, surprise!, the outlet in my town was not equipped to handle online orders.  I drive across town to get coffee at a wi-fi enable cafe.  As I was scanning a 12-pack of Diet Coke at a local supermaket, the store customer service walked by and told me that she hated automatic scanners because they take away jobs. I didn't know how to respond, as I never come face-to-face with those losing their jobs.  I have cell phone service when hiking in the mountains.  I refuse to install a home voice line.  I no longer get excited about Sex In the City.  Now I think pervasive computing is sexy.  My mother is on match.com.

         urlLink Great publicity stunt  for these guys' emarketing company, as well as their other related companies, which are sponsors. Can't find anything about this on the Segway corporate site; wonder how Dean feels about this. The "America at 10 mph" team writes that Segway supports them emotionally and has donated some Segway batteries.  Still, traveling from Seattle to Boston, their route is 4300 miles, from August 5 - Oct 18... on a Segway. They'll be known to antiquity as "those crazy Segway guys." Perhaps Po Bronson will write something up about them.

        Came across an irreverent IT news site (see it's tagline above) out of the UK called  urlLink The Register .  It has two U.S. cronies; one in San Fran and the other in Washington (D.C., I presume).   I haven't quite figured the site out yet. It's a little bit more off the cuff than simply a Wired-cum-CNet. Not quite the Drudge Report gone techy, either. The content, while perhaps not zealously fact-checked, is fresh and the titles are catchy and good for a laugh. For instance, take  urlLink "Blogging 'cruelty' allegations rock post-DNC calm"  and  urlLink "Yahoo! Offers! Local! Search!"  and  urlLink "The Merry Bloggers Set Out on 'Segway Across America' Trek."   Of course, some of the content is a little more than out there, such as the BOFH saga (Sidenote:  For fun looked up BOFH at  urlLink dictionary.com , which automatically fetched and served up the definition from  urlLink FOLDOC, the Free OnLine Dictionary of Computing ).

         'Tis the Season,     a  Design Desk article   from  urlLink Poynter Online , a journalistic web presence, hits the nail on the head.  The writer,  urlLink Anne Conneen,  suggests that when choosing visual elements to accompany election stories media outlets should toss out the blase bunting and cartoonish ballot boxes. She would prefer design desks opt for images that are informative.  She asks:  "Are     people conditioned to recognize election coverage by seeing these traditional, patriotic symbols? Are they necessary? Or, are they more decoration than information?"             One of the firms I used to work with was notorious for proudly flying the stars and stripes across otherwise usable brochure space. There is nothing worse than branding your company's website with banal stock images (even though it tends to be common practice in some industries)  .     Of course the flag is wonderful, but as Ms. Conneen suggests, let's keep it on the pole.

        Internet addiction can be considered a medical condition in Finland, a country which requires males serve a six month stint in the military. You see where this is headed. Apparently, Finnish doctors are excusing computer addicts from service citing medical reasons.  urlLink Here's a Reuters article on the topic.

        Blogging is often not the best way to share information, particularly among workers, still a recent  urlLink article  posted on TMCnet by Pete Quintas, who is CTO of SilkRoad technology, a developer of content management and web collaboration software, recently made some valid points about workplace blogging (yes, it was a sales pitch, but it was a readable sales pitch).  But I can't get behind the concept of workplace blogging. I understand that it makes sense for a handful of unique companies, but it does not make sense for the majority of corporations. When it comes to preserving worker knowledge, I tend to think that searchable, categorized databases are much better.  Quintas writes that blogs empower employees. I suppose I had never really thought about corporate blogospheres for all or most employees (though I think personal intranet pages are brilliant!). I think the approach used by Shell Oil Company is more productive ( urlLink see the Business 2.0 article on Shell ).  In 1989, Shell began a private web bulletin board, which cost $1 million     to construct but saves the company an estimated $200 million a year. In a company as large as Shell, it's sometimes difficult to know who to ask for what information, so an informal, company-wide archiving database seemed the way to go.  Shell kept the technology end simple and paid attention to the human relations end of the project. Shell recruited well-respected employees to be the board's initial posters and shepherds, if you will. These employees helped to get the online conversations rolling, which, in turn, gave the board credibility among other employess while giving them a reason to go there. Soon thousands of employees were using the board.        Shell did not categorize the board's topic areas based on rank or location or even strickly on functional area; instead, the company created 12 communities grouped by area of interest. For each category, three moderators were appointed and national promoters were appointed in every country. Soon, Shell employees across disciplines and across the globe were searching for answers on the database, as well as contributing. Shell archives board discussions, thus creating an informal answer database.  I'm not sure how empowered Shell's employees feel each time they use the database. I would imagine not so very, but I'm not sure how much empowerment matters in such a situation. It's liberating and efficient, as employees do not have to find, contact and wait on the Shell employee who possesses the key knowledge.  Employee empowerment is best when it orginates in a different way.  Empowerment, while it can mean access to information, is perhaps more about trust and decision making, at least in the corporate setting. For instance, if a subordinate uses a corporate database to track down an answer, the subordinate will feel utterly powerless if his boss will not allow him to act based upon this new-found knowledge. Empowerment is about pushing decision-making further down the line.  Blogs, too, are a tool of empowerment, but an empowerment of a different kind. I would think that keeping an internal blog on company time is not cost-effective for the vast majority of employees (there are, of course, numerous exceptions). Blogging, however, is a good way to vent. And venting is important, but it can be counterproductive if done in a subversive way (I write this with a company that is a good corporate citizen in mind).  Blogs are more powerful when they are composed by insiders and viewed by outsiders. Take CEOs and politicians that blog; they are empowering their customers, employees and constituents.

        I downloaded  urlLink Skype , and enthusiastically sent the Skype link to friends, thinking they, too, would surely love free phone calls over the internet. Not quite the case. Why don't I have any tech-loving friends?  I'm staying with my mother this weekend in rural West Virginia. The DSL is speedy but try to find a Sunday New York Times. I phoned the closest/only Wal-mart, about 25 minutes away, to inquire as to whether they carried the Times.  I knew it was a risky gamble.  The lady on the phone said she'd flip through the local Sunday paper, the Charleston Gazette, to see if she could find the "New York Times section" inside. I politely thanked her and told her not to waste her time. Sadly, I'm not kidding.  I'm addicted to the Sunday New York Times in print. And books in print. I get almost all my news and info electronically, but I wonder if I will ever make the switch to ebooks.

          Culture counts.      Take a look at Volkswagen ("the peoples' car"), which has been making inroads in China for the last 20 years. Most every taxi in China is a VW. The Chinese are very familiar with VW, and it will be interesting to see how that familiarity will play for VW when the company unleashes its luxury Phaeton model into the Chinese market.      [VW is already playing up its designation as the official auto of the 2008 Beijing Olympic games (the 2008 Olympic logo is fabulous, btw). And, interestingly, when you want to translate the  urlLink site's  Chinese characters into English, you click on a British flag. Wonder if any sites ever use American flags to designate English? The site refers to the Phaeton as a "saloon," which is British for a sedan; I had to look that Britism up. The "saloon" is built in an angular, transparent  urlLink German factory  that resembles a Frank Gehry rather than a plant/factory. VW is touting the place as a "mobility infotainment center" and offers the chance for a Phaeton purchaser to watch, in the flesh, his/her car being built/born. Interesting, indeed.]      The fleet of new Chinese car owners have been limited in their brand choice up until now, but that does not mean that the Chinese nuevo riche are not brand savvy (though perhaps not brand nuanced). The Chinese, I'm generalizing here, love logos - big, bold ostentatious logos.  Wouldn't you, if you were a citizen emerging from communism?         Enter VW's luxurious  urlLink Phaeton .    VW has had some rough times lately, with dismal sales in North America in 2003. But the Phaeton, which has done rather poorly in      America      may have a future in China.     [The     $64,600-a-pop     Phaeton V8 was released in the U.S. in November 2003.      The ultra luxurious Phaeton W12 starts at a whopping $94,600.  I can't find a price for Phaeton models available in China.]     First, the Phaeton is not made in China, so it automatically gets a "thumbs up." Second, as branding is a recently new phenomenon in China, it seems that Chinese are not as deeply entrenched in their branding paradigms as are Americans and Europeans. Granted you see several high end fashion houses in Shanghai and Beijing, but it seems that many American and European brands do well in China, even those brands that are not uber-jet-set.  In other words, I'm not sure if pedestrian is such a horrible thing when it comes to cars in China.  If it's a stylish and expensive car, it might not matter that it's a VW.  For example, Buick, of all brands, makes a killing in Shanghai. It's an odd feeling, being in Shanghai, surrounded by Buicks. Yet these are not your grandfather's Buicks. My friend Chris, on seeing a Shanghainese friend's car from a distance, remarked, "That's a nice car. Hey, that's a... a Buick???"  When Americans think   VW, they think functional, trendy, well-engineered cars. Americans will not, at least within the next year, make the leap and associate VW with luxury simply based on the Phaeton, or even the knowledge that Audi is VW's sister company (for what it's worth, Audi will soon roll out a less expensive scaled-down Audi dubbed the A3), though the Toureg may have a future.  But the Chinese may very well start to associate WV with luxury - in some ways, they have been doing so for 20 years.
