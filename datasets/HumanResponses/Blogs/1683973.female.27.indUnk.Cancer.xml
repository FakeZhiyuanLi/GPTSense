      Althoug its only 3:20 in the morning it is none-the-less New Year's Eve... *sigh*  There really aren't a lot of words going on tonight - could be the onset of exhaustion knocking on my door...  Michael O'Connor.  I am so going to set myself up to be hurt again this time.  He admits he's bad at relationships because he just loves women - "I love to love love".  But in the end, could it work?  Could there be ANYTHING?  Tonight will be lonely - a new year and still no one to kiss.  Ah.  I don't know yet what the day is going to bring to me, so there is no point in pondering pending yuckiness.  When he sings he just grabs me - I'd even dare use the word kismet on this one...  I think I have already.  Isn't there some rule about this - and if not shouldn't there be?  Why can't someone dig me first?  Why not this beautiful man?  Why not this time - something, ANYTHING.  That word haunts me as I am trying to find me.  It's time - way past due.  Who am I, and am I really worth much of anything to anyone until I know that secret answer?  Faith... got to have faith faith faith... and so on.  I'm in here - peeking around the corner - shy?  WHO is shy to themselves?  Self-modesty.  Shit.  "A decade ago I never thought at 23 I'd be on the verge of spontaneous combustion".  I know that I am a very desireable person - why can't I show that.  DAMN IT!  WHy did I turn my cheek when he kissed me tonight?  Why didn't I just kiss him last night?  Next time - there will always be a next time - or a next year... which one will come first?  Lame.

      Things are starting to fall into place - finally something is going right and in my favor.  This afternoon I'm going to fill out my apartment application at Camelot.  I can't believe that I'm going to be moving again.  I thought, well hoped, this place would work out, but sometimes friendships just aren't meant to be this close.  I asked Bob if he could help, and he actually said that he woudl - color me suprised!!  I hope this move will help me bring some closure and peace to my life.  Honestly, with so much changing for me and things going crazy, what is one more move?  One more change?  I often wonder who is in charge of pulling the strings of my life.  Ultimately I realize that it is me, and I am at least fortunate enough to know that much!  I've just decided that although it would be incredibly nice to have someone to share all of this with - I should be grateful for those that I do have.  My family loves me and I have a few good friends, what more is really important?  My life is more together than I had thought - I'm VERY happy about that.  I know things could be a lot worse, and lets never hope for that.  I never want to be one of those people that lets life's burdens rule them.  It's not worth it to suffer for attention.  I've been down, most likely I'll be down again, but remembering that every down has to come up is very important to keep myself breathing.

      And here we go - moving yet again.  I hope this time it will work out good - I'll be alone again, and I can see that is definitely a positive decision.  I didn't want to move again, ever, as if that was possible.  I'm pretty excited all at the same time though.  I'm going to have a dishwasher and a sliding glass door... and stuff and things.  It's weird, but I think I'm actually beginning to find some faith again - but I feel like a poser now believing that I can believe in God.  Isn't it supposed to be something you know without thinking?  Anyway - another friendship is coming to an end - tragic?  Probably not.  I have spent nearly the last 20 years defending Marie just to have it end like this.  Lame.  I suppose I should feel bad or something, but really, I've let her hurt me repeatedly since we were kids - it never mattered if she was pitting me against someone or sleeping with some guy I was into.  I'm not sure if she was always just jealous of me - can't help but wonder if she still is.  I know she would have traded childhoods with me in a heart beat... but isn't she supposed to be the happy one getting married, having another baby, finding a house???  Sometimes things don't make any sense, and  maybe those things that trouble us the most should be the things that trouble us the least.  *sigh*

      So tonight I decided it was going to be stupid night at the big party in my head.  I knew that he wouldn't share my feelings - how many times has Shawn told me that he doesn't want any relationships right now?  Why do I have to be such a moron?  Somehow I thought it would be a good thing to get this all out in the open - but always realizing that rejection was going to be ultimate.  The only good thing that can happen at this point is the fact that Shawn is completely capable of acting like I never said anything in the first place.  I just don't want to be like all the other girls that are "so in love" with him - I don't want to be seen that way.  I'd like to think I'm above all that.  I have this desire to see Shawn all the time - I feel like me when I'm with him.  I'm finally comfortable with someone else - like maybe someone can really understand me ans where I'm coming from.  I feel like this is important for me.  I need to be needed - isn't it just my nature?  I do think that if someone would help show me that I'm a good person, then I could possibly believe it myself.  Despite all this, I am (yes really) human.  He has the hands - the working/fixing hands.  Why now?  Why him?  I heard this morning a sermon about how we only seem to ask God for things around Christmas... and it's sad, but true, at least in my life.  Here I am, asking for help to find some better life and love - and what have I really given to God in my life?  I would like to understand - because for whatever it might be worth, He more than likely understands me.

      So another year has passed by...  I think I am beginning to reach that age where it doesn't seem possible time has gone by so fast.  I'm approaching 24... alone.  My problem is the people I set my heart on.  I have strange feelings for my best friend, Shawn... even though I can't even explain to myself what the are exactly.  I have normal "crushes"... but nothing ever comes of them.  God -- I'm 23 and my journal sounds just like one I would have kept at 16...  I'm full of broken and unfinished thoughts.  Perhaps I should just start speaking my mind - going for what I want.  But is it worth the pain and most likely the heart break?  Ugh.  I've now realized that I was just in love with the idea of being in love with Bob - honestly, if Glenna makes him happier than I did, then I should, can and will be happy for him for that.  I will most likely never respect his carelessness for his friends feelings, but I guess he has done what he needs to do for him at this moment.  I do thank him VERY MUCH for helping me realize that Mark truely is my past - something that I think I knew for a long time before I was willing to openly admit it.  It's funny when you actually reaize how many days have passed without even thinking about someone you always thought would haunt your mind.  So much is changing in and around my life right now that i am completely amazed at how well I have kept myself together.  To some I may seem completely off - but I'm the one who knows how much closer to the edge I could be with all this.  I love the holiday season, but it is so much nicer with someone to hold hands with in the snow and wrap your arms around for warmth.  This will be my second in a row alone.  Please God, don't let me become the crazy cat lady... please... is that asking too much?

      I can say with some level of certainty that Michael O'Connor is finished being my friend.  Am I really this much of a sociopath?  I don't know exactly what my problem is - I'm obsessed?  I thought this time I was cool... but then that whole "rule" thing.  New rule -  NO   MORE   RULES !!!  I like Melissa - I would just like her more if it wasn't such a "serious" thing with her and Michael.  They met on a blind date - go figure.  For the first time in  so  long i asserted myself, and that made me happy, but most likely I pushed too damn hard and now I'm trapped behind my own fucking creation - MY FIREWALL!   SHIT !  I've got to stop and just be a normal person for a while.  Last night was so much fun - and oddly, as much as I want to know Michael, as much as I fantasize about him wanting to know me, hanging out last night in the hot tub I  did   not  plot ways to make him mine over hers.  They fit together - I'm the odd puzzle piece.  What else is new?  Ask Bob.  Ask Mark.  I guess you could ask anyone.

      And the new year has come and gone in the slightest blink.  Where will this year take me?  Why can't I keep Michael off my mind for just 10 minutes?  Why - because he absolutely fascinates me.  I just want to know everything there is to know about this man - but do I have the guts for the rejection?  I need to convince myself that failure is not my only option in all of this.  After all - he did call - and he did say he liked talking to me (said I was hip).  So what am I so afraid of?  Maybe I'm just afraid that he really is as bad at relationships as he says he is - or maybe I'm afraid that I am.  In my life I've only had 2 1/2 "serious" boyfriends.  Patrick left me for someone else, but didn't he try to hold on to me just a little longer?  Mark tore me up, but only after I ripped him a few new assholes.  Bob said I wasn't ready for what he wanted - or was I, but just not with him?  There is someone who will push all my buttons right and keep me on track.  Could it  be  that Michael is that one guy?  Shit.  I'm late for my date with Nick.  I hope I can put Michael on the back shelf for a while.  What am I doing to myself?

      I may wonder some day why I can't seem to keep a journal, most likely I'm lazy - or perhaps I can't even explain myself to myself.  Maybe it's because I've once again found myself completely into the unavailable Charlie Hoffman - not only is he taken, he's also only 19.  I loved 19 - I never wanted to leave - I only hope I come across as half as smart as Charlie does.  I just love talking to him - it's real conversation, about real things - I miss that  so  much.  I told him how I felt abotu things - about having a "crush" on him, and most likely he already knew, I'm sure I'm even more obvious than I think I am.  I just want to drop everything just to spend time with hiim.  Other than this newest turmoil...  Slept with Bob Chaffer (fate coming true?), slept with Jason Rosso, slept with Ben (again).  Maybe I'm a slut, maybe Tom and Kris are right - maybe that is my destiny.   FUCK   ME .  Anyway - I'm going to smoke 7 more minutes off my life, and maybe go suck down 10 more cups of coffee - I'm good with all that after all.  I need to think, need to clear my head.  And besides - maybe I'll run into Charlie...  *sigh*  I WAS RIGHT :^}

      I'm not sure if its really the 26th... pretty sure though.  Just talked to Charlie - this is the longest crush I've had running for quite some time.  But, I don't know why since it isn't going anywhere, and that is just about the same as nowhere fast.  He's in Montreal right now - although he is coming home a day early - I should be so lucky to think it was because he kind of misses me...  Most likely no, but it kind of makes me happy to hope for all that.  And what else...  Oh yeah, Bob is  talking  about breaking up with Glenna - but all he ever does is talk... and talk... and talk.  I'd have sex with him - not one doubt in my mind.  Life is a crazy thing - I'm not sure I'm as of yet equipped to deal with it all very well...  I'm as fucked up and fucked over as everyone else - but its so much easier to think no one else can understand.  April is almost here - planning some changes.  1/2 pack a day and weight loss - am I asking too much of myself all at once?  Maybe then I would feel better about myself - afterall, we all make our own destinies.  But nasty fate always puts her evil hand in the deck.  Anyway - tonight I sleep and think of Charlie, wonder about Bob and never figure out me.

      Four years ago today I started my job at the UofR - thankfully, that chapter ended last year.  Maybe it wasn't the best decision at that time, but ultimately it was for the best.  Why can't I keep Charlie off my mind -  that  is a lost cause.  I just love that this person wants to talk about real things - not just stereotypical "guy things"!  We talk about government, and last night he even asked me what my biggest fear was...  I'm not sure  anyone  has ever cared enough to ask me that.  But that girlfriend of his... is it Nikki or Nicky...  Where was she last night?  She is supposed to be home this weekend.  I met her last week, I can't say I was impressed - she didn't say anything but "hello" to me.  Oh well, next fall Charlie is off to Potsdam - with his girl...  i wonder (at this moment anyway) if he will miss me even half as much as I will potentially miss him.  As it would turn out - Charlie is everything I never knew I always wanted.

      Ask me what has not happened since last entry...  Everything continues to fall apart - but I believe this may be the never-ending story of my life...  Oh well, it must be what keeps me normal and "sane".  Still smoking, still gaining weight.  Had sex with Bob, fucked things up worse with Bob.  He's not for me - I think I'm beginning to realize all of this.  He's worth the fight - just most likely not worth mine.  He broke up with Glenna - she's still always around though so sometimes it's hard to believe.  Basically he now has his license back to fuck whoever he wants and keep messing people up.  More than likely he's still fucking Glenna too - it's his breakup pattern.  But I broke up with him - right?  I'm the one who wanted out...  Not exactly how I remember things.  But, life is a continuous journey and these are the lessons I have to learn and the crosses I have to bear.  Started another new job at Thompson this past Monday - here's hoping I'm good at it and enjoy it.  So far, no major problems with co-workers, 4 days later that is to say.  Time for a deep breath yet?  Falling farther and farther behind financially... will I always have to have 2 jobs?  Where's my shining prince with the big wallet?  Anyway - it doesn't matter much - trying to find me as always - it's healthy right?  Thought for the day: We were not asked to be born, and just like our parents we will spend our entire lives trying to figure out who we are and what we're doing here.  Why not make the most of it all and seize the moment, right?

      Another piece of my life in writing - I'm not very good at this journal thing - perhaps I'm just too internal.  So much has happened/changed over the last 4 months that I cannot possibly put it all down in words.l  The major happening is Britt Bounds.  We are connected - he just hasn't caught up as of yet - and just might never.  I seem to have this continuous pattern of being into everyone who is not into me.  Sure - he's got a girlfriend now, will they last?  Will I still be a part of his big picture when they don't?  Am I even willing to wait and find out?  I never talk to Bob anymore.  Or Shawn.  Charlie left for Potsdam without even saying goodbye.  I never hear from Nikki anymore either.  Maybe I've just become completely self-absorbed.  Maybe that's a good thing.  I need to find love - badly.  Not family love, friend love or self love.   REAL  LOVE.  I try to stay cool, I try to sound cool at the very least - but am I trying so hard I come across as lame?  Who values me besides my cat?  Ah...  I'm really too torn up to think about me right now.  Tonight I will fall asleep thinking once more about how I ruined things with Mark, how I gave up everything with Bob, how I miss Charlie too much and how it will never connect with Britt.

      Who am I?  What am I doing to these wonderful people around me?  Why did I have to go and make things awkward between me and Jeff?  Am I really this stupid?  I'm totally falling for Chris Ruscio - but I'm holding on to this guy staying at my house for some seemingly indeterminible amount of time...  Am I fucking with him - or me?  But that's just it... there is no fucking - just MIND fucking - and I'm the only one playing this hand of fool's cards.  I know I've put this wall between us, and sadly enough I'm kind of having fun doing it.  Perhaps it's just because I know someday he'll just be gone - like everyone else.  Which is also why I don't know why I'm trying to fool myself into thinking anything will ever happen with Chris - don't they always say things only happen when you least expect them to?  And in an even more twisted reality of what I'm doing to Jeff - the thought of him reciprocating is almost terrifying...  So why would I let him believe that is what I want - when what I really want is this guy who lives in a shit hole and will most likely never want me...  How does that work anyway?  How does anything work - my brain most definitely is not working...  Sleep... and just let the bed bugs bite me so hard I can't come back to this really stupid reality I'm forcing my hand into.  AMEN.

      I love these people living with me - Jeff Cole and Stelia Nappi mean a lot to me - even if they are no longer together.  In my mind they are and always will be.  I wouldn't trade the experiences they've helped to provide.  If I could do more for them I would, but my hands are completely tied.  I lend my ear every time I can, to either of them - without bias or prejudice to the other one.  I have internalized most of their pain within myself in my struggle to figure things out.  Maybe its more about me finding me - understanding human pain.  Maybe I just like them so i give.  Maybe I was always jealous... maybe I still am.  They are still happy to be with each other, if not awkward.  Why am I not able to hang out with former lovers and boyfriends?  Most likely I'm not as hip as I wish I was.  I know I'm neurotic - but I thought I was pretty good at hiding it most of the time anyway.  Someone needs to blow one of those party favors in my head to set off the right electrodes or fire some synapses in the right direction...  Or maybe I'll just keep living vicariously through those around me...

      Tonight I finally made contact with my newest and brightest - Chris Ruscio - most likely won't go anywhere - hell he even said he was happy being single, not having to answer to anyone...  Ah well - the dreaming is nice.  He's crazy with energy and so beautiful to look at.  Here's the thing though...  Britt stopped over tonight too...  I can say with some certainty that I'm not over that one yet either.  Of course not - that would make this all too easy.  I'm always afraid I'm giving up a good thing.  Well, as far as good things go - Britt doesn't even think twice about me - but why would he?  And then I ask myself, why would Chris?  I'm beginning to think no one will see the beauty that is me - the beauty of gray.  I know I have a lot to offer, but the right person has to come along at the right time... and be receptive.  But this one...  I'm not sure anyone can tame his energy - let alone me.

      Hardly a day goes by that I don't somewhat reflect on what fate has brought me to - and even though I realize this is where I'm supposed to be, it's not where I want to be.  They say I'm the only one with the power to change things - so who the HELL keeps turning off my circuit breaker?  I live with Abby now - not so horrible as of yet, but still I'd rather be sharing this space with someone I loved...  I guess we all make do and get by.  He's out there - why can't I feel his energy?  24...  Where will I be when I'm 58?  Still watching syndicated reruns of Dawson's Creek and thinking of good cat names?  I'm really feeling lonely - although earlier tonight I had a fleeting good minute where I knew I was too fucked up for a relationship and I was actually  happy  about it.  But wouldn't this all be easier if I had someone to say good night to and hold during the night?  And so it goes.  My parents have taken me over financially - which is an enormous weight off my shoulders - but now I will owe them the rest of their lives... *sigh*  I need something, if I even cared about sex I'd say that was it...  But I need more.  I feel myself smiling through my depression more and more each day - where is my cowboy to take me away?  Who wants to be with a fat and depressed chick though?  Somewhere...  That's me, always finding the wrong aura...  I think my internal mood ring will be black for quite a while.

      It's interesting to go back and read all the stupid things I've written over the last year - right now it's laughable what I said about Jeff.  I've fallen in love with this man who harbours enormous amounts of childhood pain...  It's not my fault - and I let him explode on me...  But I want him here - here in my bed, in my life, in my heart.  For two months now he has been near to me - in waking hours and sleep - but tonight he slept on the couch...  Tonight he swore he didn't care about me... he wants nothing from me - not my love, not my home...  I know myself well enough to know I need to be needed, and most likely to be wanted.  I don't believe he doesn't care about me - or even that he doesn't love me.  The hardest thing to believe, though, is  I   LOVE   JEFFREY   DAVID   COLE !!!  DAMMIT!  I don't want to be in love - I don't want this hurt - I don't want... this rejection.  Love love love love love.  Training myself to say this word and feel this word.  I do mean it, and I do feel it...  Why?  Why now?  Why him?  Why me...  Love love love....

      How can you fall so much in love for someone who so much does not want you there?  How can you ache so much to say the right thing and more importantly take back the wrong thing?  How can you love when you thought all your love was gone?  How can you not start a new year, let alone a new day, without wondering how it is that you've gone so far just to see you're really still on square one with everything you've learned still sitting just a finger length away?  How can you not expect to be compared and compare people to others in and from your life?  How can you know so much, but have so little to go on?  How can you want to do wonderful sweet things for someone who just tried to carve out your heart?  How can you wish someone who can't stand your face was lying next to you?  How can someone love and hate you in one breath - and how can that same someone say they're leaving and still be so there?  How can you say you just don't care anymore, when everything about you craves to care and be cared for?  How can you end an argument that has no collective beginning - an argument that began in two separate pasts?  How can you begin to understand anyone who is not your direct clone?  How can you close doors and maybe never reopen them?  How do you not tread on painfully familiar territory with someone you never wanted to walk that path with?  How can you be called beautiful when you hate yourself for giving up?  How can any of these questions ever or never be answered?

      Oh Jeff -  What a mess - I must confess...  A letter that will never be written, a poem never heard, a song never sung.  I thought I could do this - thought I could outlast this stark reality that I never even wanted.  I can't come home like this - this is a mess - MY mess...  I still love him, even while he hates me, even while this all falls apart around me more and more with every breath I exhale.  I can't stand hearing him laugh with Abby while I sit beside the ugly green-eyed monster.  I can't explain this without causing a fight - a further rift between two people already so far apart.  I wanted to be the first to move on, but when he doesn't even care that I'm standing still, what's the point?  It's time to admit that I just can't do this - I'm failing out, dropping out... falling off.  I don't want to be the forgotten "princess" in someone else's limelight.  I don't want to be the outsider, the third wheel in  my house !  I built here, let people in, made it theirs... and I still know its mine - but now I can't take it back.  Another mess I've made, uncleanable, unimaginable...  PAINFUL - and I'm alone in  this  misery...

      New beginning?  Blank page?  Just a journal with no real soul to call it's own.  Worn out recording.  I  still  love him - can't stand to see or feel his hurting anymore.  Why can't he need me and let me in?  Why can't I figure out how to reach him?  Why can't I just let go?  It's not a " fear " of lonliness - I'm lonely day in and day out.  It's anguish - tormenting pain.  I don't feel psychic - I definitely don't come across that way...  Energy fields just push their way past my boundaries.  Oh well, someone needs to feel the blunt of hurt for those that cannot carry it.  I'm just so tired.  ALL I REALLY WANT IS SOME PEACE, MAN  So much to do - never any time.  Ah - let's kick out our ya-ya's and slam the door.  Blahbedy-blah.  I think it's my brain twitching this time.

      "Quarter Life Crisis".  I've stopped going along with the crowd and started to comprehend that there are many things about myself that I didn't know and really don't like.  I've started feeling vulnerable, wondering where I'll be in a year or two.  Then I get anxious, because I don't even know where I am right now.  I started realizing that most people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that I thought were so close aren't exactly the greatest people I've ever met, and the people I've lost touch with are some of the most significant.  I look at my job... it's not even neighboring what I thought I would be doing.  I know that I'm going to have to start at the bottom - and that  really  scares me.  My opinions have gotten stronger.  I see what others are doing and find myself judging more because suddenly I realize that I have certain boundaries in my life, I'm constantly adding to my list of what is agreeable and what isn't.  One minute I'm insecure, and then the next... "secure".  I smile and weep with the greatest forces in my life.  I feel detached and intimidated and doubtful.  Suddenly, change is the antagonist and I'm trying to adhere to the past for dear life.  But the past is wandering further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where I am or move forward.  I get my heart broken and wonder how someone I loved could do so much damage to me.  I  know  that I'm not a bad person.  I go through the same emotions and questions over and over.  I talk to my friends about the same old topics because I cannot seem to find a resolution.  I worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for myself...  And, while winning the race would be fantastic, right now, I'd just like to be a contender.

      Maybe I thought this was over - then again there was a point when I thought  we  were over.  He left me in February to pursue his dreams and get away from our mess...  But in May he wanted to come back - made promises that I should have known better than to believe...  And here we are in June - my front door has been kicked off the hinges, my bathroom door punched off its frame and so many large and small personal items broken in hit path.  He said and says he loves me - but I can't avoid the thought that above all that he hates me with some deep rooted and malevolent persistence.  But I love him.  I love me.  Where is the line, how do I somehow keep stepping right over it?  Love - that's how.  There is nothing I can do for him - nothing he wants done.  he doesn't even care enough about me  OR  himself to do anything to help.  This has to be the end of this - I can't stand to watch him killing himself every day - because I'm not dumb and I love us both too much.

      "It's always all about you!!!"  Does it only become all about you when someone else tells you it is?? My theory is that people only say it's all about you when they realize it's really all about themselves. I find that it's mostly said to me just before being told to get out of their face, because they don't feel like talking or resolving whatever the issue is that is causing you to act as though it's "all about you"... So, who is it really all about then?  When two people are involved, can it even ever really be about one or the other? Don't we always consider the other person, even if it is not in a kind light?  I locked the door when I left, not because I didn't care about the other person without a key, but because I didn't want them to be there when I returned... and in that simple thought alone, wasn't I thinking and caring about what the other person would or would not do? And, just as an aside, I would have been very hurt if that person wasn't sitting outside of the locked door when I did get back.  As it stands now we are both being all about ourselves... I'm sitting in the computer room typing this, and the other person is in the living room watching a movie for the millionth time. I know in my heart that the other person is just trying to avoid dealing, but I won't say that. I don't want them to feel that I think it's always about them.

      And so time moves on... and we move on... He's back, all of his stuff is back, we're back. It's nice talking baby talk in the privacy of OUR home, it's nice eating cold pizza and watching art films together, it's nice knowing he's coming home to me after work. It's just really nice to know that he is mine.

      Just when you think things may be going better than you thought... He left this morning in my car and took all of his stuff too. Sometimes it hurts to love someone. I guess I shouldn't have believed things were alright when we went to bed last night, I guess I shouldn't have believed that he would stay.  By the end of the night last night we were laughing and holding each other on the couch... Maybe if I had gone to bed at the same time he did. Maybe if I had gone downstairs and made him all that fried food crap he wanted. Maybe.  How hard do you have to fight for someone for someone to realize that you need them? How hard is it to admit that someone fought as hard for you as you for them?

      A new year - a new page - but the same old story to tell.  I'm not happy - and this is definitely  not  new.  For two years I've held my tumultuous love to Jeff - that has definitely  not  changed.  My music is all played out - the soundtrack to my life is on pause.  Maybe it's just skipping at a slow tempo.  It's been two weeks since he left (this time)...  I don't sleep.  I don't eat.  I obsess about how to help him - how to give him help he never asked for or wanted.  This time it was just too much, too far.  "I can't promise that I'll grow those wings, or get this tarnished halo shining.  But I'll never betray your trust, angel mine."  Man.  I can't even think - let alone express myself - even to myself.  What am I going to do now?  I'll bet he's going to be hard to get over.  Get over?  I can barely move, let alone breathe.  Maybe it was never right - but for more than two years he's been my world - my  universe !  For all of the names he called me, the nasty comments, grabbing me, throwing me... why does his exit hurt so much?  I guess I just want to know that hate is not his final association with me.  I have tried to convince myself that it really was me being a bitch - but I can't.  I guess I never knew the right thing to say or do.  But, I'll be damned if I didn't always know when his anger was coming.  Somehow I always had something wrong to say that pushed it over.  Please, someone - open the door... I don't think I can stay here anymore.  I've loved - I've lost, and it really fucking hurts.  Although he has left me three or four times before - this is real.  He doesn't call - he even asked me not to take his phone calls - or take him back.  When this all started I thought it was just for fun - nothing serious.  Here was this man, fresh out of a reoccuring relationship... and he really seemed to want me.  Even then I thought he would leave and leave me - I just never thought two and a half years later he would take so much of me with him when he did leave.  I wish I could say I didn't even notice he was gone - but there is so much still here, here in the wake he left.  The wake that is loving Jeff Cole.  I feel his touch, his arms, his lips.  I hear his laughter, his heart, his soul.  Mixed in with all of this is the feeling of fear.  I was afraid of him leaving.  Afraid of him not loving me.  Afraid I was saying the wrong thing.  Afraid I wasn't lavishing enough of myself on him.  How could I even think I was ever what he wanted, much less needed?  I'm not even what I needed.  All I needed was SILENCE!  My own silence.  Not one imposed by Jeff and his sidekick "Anger".  I needed release - from me and my life.  I  wanted  someone I could share with - not be afraid of his response.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I love him.  Time.  Just time.  We both need to heal and grow.  And then, if time permits and all forces are aligned, maybe then it will be time.  Until then this will be my onus.  Until that time passes and I start to heal.  It's so hard to deal with believing this is the final end, the last goodbye.  I cannot follow him on his dreams and I most certainly will never be the one to make them come true.  Right now I just hope that someday, some way, somehow, someone will bring Jeff back to me - My Jeff...  God dammit.  He is as limitless as the cosmos.  As unconfined as the universe.  Boundless as the milky way.  But... Small enough to touch  my  world,  my  life and  my  heart.  Jeff has so much to offer - I just hope he can find a way to tame his heart long enough to share it.  "It wears me out.  But if I could be who you wanted all the time."

      Funny how sitting around doing nothing can lead to doing so much.  Krista stopped by last night, and although I was playing hookie from work we went out in search of food -- not an easy task on a Sunday night.  We went to some little dive called Neptunes in Honeoye, but of course, the restaurant was closed -- had a drink and headed to MacGregors in Canandaigua.  I ran into Victoria Roberts and Carrie Stocks -- they were both so trashed I doubt they even remember it today.  I haven't seen them in like 7 years or so... strange.  Krista ran into an old friend too -- Arend (strange but very cool name).  I like this guy.  He's not my Weezer-geeky guy, and he's spoken for as well (what else is new anyway).  He's smart...  I dig that a lot.  I'm ready to make all those life changes I've been promising myself I will make for years...  I just hope I have the energy to do it.  Shawn Fenner actually sent me birthday wishes (although 2 days late) yesterday.  It was nice of him to do so, since he's taken on the junior high role of dissed boyfriend as of late (hard to believe he's 31).  Ralph still hasn't called, and he's still fucking Gina so who realy gives a shit anyway?  Yes... 27... I'm 27.  Yuck.

      Pleasure or partnership?  My best friend has been married for almost two years -- and his wife just told him three weeks ago that she wanted a divorce.  She didn't want to talk about it, or seek counselling -- she was done, and had felt that way for the past six months.  Keeping in mind they are both in the Navy, and have both been on and off shore for the past year and a half -- he had no idea this was coming -- she completely blindsided him.  I really liked his wife too.  But I really like him more.  You see -- this best friend of mine has always met the qualifications of my ideal mate -- he's good looking, honest, hard working, loyal and we have the same kind of background (it happens when you grow up together).  I wouldn't necessarily say I've had a crush on him, but the thought did entertain my mind a few years ago, but it didn't work out then, and life ticked on.  When he got married to this girl that he had only known for about seven months, my heart did break just a little, even though I was involved in a relationship that ended up lasting a year and half after he got married.  One more truely great guy off the market.  As I have said, I really did like his wife.  And then a couple weeks ago he called to tell me she was leaving him -- perhaps he thought I could sympathize, as I had ended the forementioned relationship a few months back.  He then came home a week later -- after a night of (some) drinking and (a lot) laughing and (even more) reminiscing -- we had sex.  He knew I felt a little guilty, but as he said: "I feel a whole lot guiltier than you".  So, if we both felt guilty -- why did it happen?  Since we have both said there were no regrets -- yeah, sure.  This is not the first time I have been the lucky recipient of just-out-of-a-relationship sex, and dare I hope it be the last?  I have yet to meet that guy that can end a relationship (be it serious or casual), and not seek out new sexual endeavors.  I'm not like that, none of my close female friends are like that.  I can end a relationship and go over a year without getting laid -- or even wanting to for that matter.  I've been out of a relationship for over seven months, and until the time I slept with my friend I have turned down more than one proposal of sex -- because I didn't WANT to have sex!  I think it just felt alright to do it with my best friend of years and years -- and the fact that I felt it was all I could give him in my sympathies for his situation.  So where does the line between pleasure and partnership fall?  I don't have casual sex, I'm down with committed relationships.  But I do like to be touched, although not by strangers or people I just met that night.  Thoughts? Comments? Concerns?
