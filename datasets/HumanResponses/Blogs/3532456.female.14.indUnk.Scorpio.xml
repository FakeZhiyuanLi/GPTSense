      Haven't gone out of the house for two consecutive days, Rather like the feeling. Without anyone to be in the house, with all windows closed,just me , myself and God. I will probably become a lazy bum or a bit zi pi if I continue like this...hehe...haven't been studying really...spent less than half the day...so guilty...spent most of the time watching TV or surfing the net...was watching 'Wan Quan Yu Le' todae and they were PK-ing sign language....so funny and lame...Wang Renfu's action very over(as usual). Laughing all the way...and the sign language techer herself oso so funny....a bit act cute lah...but anywayz I think it's quite amazing how God can use every part of the body to show even if u can't talk... Mell...so sian gotta go school tmr...lazy to get out of the house...haha....I am alreadi a lazy bum....Bummer.

      A bright Sunday morning spoilt by one comment, shan't reveal what. Went to church feeling a little disappointed that I can't enjoy the church camp...got everybody to try the smoothie but got sum good and bad comments. Alicia and Victoria, thanks for ur encouragement but as for the guys, I've got nothing to say except to resign to fate that it tastes like medicine to you....hehe!! Promise to improve on it... Feeling veri bored now...nothing to do...dun feel like doing homework though I've got loads of it..taking some tests online...checking my mail...feeling thoroughly bored. That's life...period.

      I woke up reluctantly this morning, contemplating on whether to go to school or not, but in the end, I decided to open my droopy eyes. I can't afford to pon choir...hehe. My voice was terrible....sounded totally flat.....I guess it's partly the lethargy that is getting to me and my muscles are aching. It shows that I realli stretched for dance practice....hehe !!! Lynn. are u happi???? haha.... But anywayz....I had so much fun going for dance practice yesterday, we learned the second verse and I mastered the breakdance move !!! YEAH !!! KFC for dinner was okay except the fact that it came after 1-and-a-half hours later...I was starving by then!! HEHE....felt a strong sense of satisfaction becos I was the first one to alight from the train!!! Quite lame but anywayz....the youths were going to camp at Denice's place...too bad I can't go for the ice-skating todae !!! Would have hurt myself quite a bit to live up to my accident-prone status....hehe !!! Gotta finish my work...I am saying this everyday but the work just dun seem to finish up...Oh Lord HELP !!!

The bad thing is that i haven't finished my homework....sighz....I better go and do it now....

      Hmmm....things were certainly not going my way yesterday....hehe...it strikes me now that I am always blogging the event the day after.....but never mind. Had a bad day at choir...  Bad incident no.1 : I had to wake up at like 5.30 am in the morning to get ready to school cos I had to reach school by 7.30 am.. was alreadi veri tired out by the last few days. Bad incident no.2 : Attendance was quite okay but there were still sum hiccups wif ppl not cuming. Bad incident no.3 : We completely disappointed our conductors by singing badly for the second half+ musical(first half was fantastic though) Bad incident no.4 : conductors decided to cut down our final song that we hoped so much to sing(but it's realli our own fault.) Bad incident no.4 : practically every girl started shedding tears Bad incident no.5 : ppl think playin the blaming game...they almost started a huge quarrel(I kept quiet cos I felt no need to add in and was alreadi utterly disppointed...juz walked away. period) Bad incident no.6: continued to lose my appetite....skipped lunch and went back home with a throbbing headache.  well....I couldn't take the lethargy so I plopped onto my mum's comfortable queen-sized bed and fell asleep after taking a shower..didn't realli fall asleep but was glad to keep my eyes shut. still felt quite weak after waking up...had the sudden craving for vegetable rice...probably becos I haven't touched a single bit of rice since tuesday. spent the whole night doing the rest of my homework while watching TV...started talking and talking...probably juz to vent the hurt in my heart.  that's it. period.

      Lethargy has taken its toll on me.....and I am to last until next Tuesday when it's all over !!!! It's not exactly that I dun want to perform for the concert...but I am realli, realli tired of the attendance that the choir is giving me. Can't even get full attendance for just one day....excuses after excuses....I am realli tired out by this concert.. I actually broke down and juz cried when our practice was cut short on tuesday by unforeseen circumstances. I felt like giving up totally at tat point in time. I have to constantly remind myself to depend on God and not on my own strength....now what I can do is to lift everything up to Him !! I guess God put everyone to sum trials and tribulations to make everyone a stronger person. So I will not cry more and be defeated by the devil....juz like that !!!   We dun need the devil cos the devil is a liar !!!!  As for now,I need sum recharging before starting again....and dance practice....yipee !!! A great way to de-stress....

Worship Ministry was put next to Youth Ministry so Vic, Lynn and me were like crossovers....jumping from here to there!!! haha...was wearing the agogo costume(got shot for this,-_-thanks a lot, chris...hehe) and high heels...I seriously dun noe how Jud can survive in such high heels, my feet was aching at the end of the day !!! haha...probably I am more 'man' so cannot survive...hehe !!! I think the Sunday school's booth was the nicest or maybe 'cutest'...hehe....seeing all those past photos of everyone made me realise we have realli grown so much through the years !!!! Getting on with age....hehe..  Had dance practice after that....muscles were aching like siao but I had a fun time trying to learn the second verse and I succeeded...haha !!!  Some things I have learned after yesterday : 1. Have a willing heart 2. Have a tolerant mind 3. Be a healthy soul 4. Do things with all your strength 5. Unity is the best policy

      'O' Level listening Comprehension. I woke up feeling sianz half cos it was so early in the morning and I was feeling super lethargic becos of my flu...anywayz the exam went smoothly and we were rather amused that the passages were broadcast on Symphony 92.4FM...so interesting !!! Was enjoying the classical music...actually more of lying on the table lar...haha !!!  The exam ended at 9.30 am...and it's like where am I going to spend the rest of the time before going to church at 2.30 pm? Finally decided to go to heartland mall...made a point to walk veri slowly so that can waste time...in the end I reached there at 10.30 am !!! Went to buy 'Zi Jin Zi Dian' which is 'Top on the Forbidden City' in chinese at TS. I thought it was a 5566 ou xiang ju but in the end it's K ONE. so disappointing....but I still bought cos I liked one of the songs that 5566 + K One sang together.... I am so angry though...didn't see music junction at the other side so when I checked out the price at mj when I spotted it...it's actually cheaper than in TS....so angry with myself...grrr!!! Popped by Yoshinoya for lunch and had a box of muah chee thereafter....I toured heartland mall in circles until I couldn't take it anywayz...I took bus 80 to church and time check was 12.00 pm...nobody was there thus I was sitting outside No.20.... At 12.45 pm....I couldn't stand the boredom....so I made a trip back to heartland mall yet AGAIN !!!! Toured the whole shopping mall in detail...finally bought a phone sock in Mini Toons....killing time all the way !!! Went back to church at 1.30 pm...sat there till everyone came...was trying to cure boredom by listening to the CD and learning the words...haha!!! Dance prac was fun but I felt veri weak actually...almost wanted to puke but made it !!! Went home dragging my feet...met chris when I got on the bus and he got off...haha... Now...I am feeling veri tired totally...gotta go do my work...  Long and bored account. period.

      Feeling a bit dizzy now....I was struck with high fever in the wee hours of the morning so didn't go to school todae....I didn't even noe I had fever until my mum took my temperature...probably the fever left me in a delirious state.  Yesterday's concert was totally smashing...people said we sang well...quite happy that it turned out well...at least all our efforts didn't go to waste. All of us were very focused cos we are afraid that we will make our conductors unhappy. VJ and I were so nervous being the emcees and I want to thank Miss Wynne Lee for the encouragement that she gave us !!! And one more thing...it's the first time I felt we were so enthu abt our school cheer....we shouted like so loudly...haha...not forgetting our 'ai hui jie' and 'zhi hong ge' cheer at the end...it was so funny !!! I think Miss Lim and Mr Yong were a bit shocked and amused at the same time!!! Hehe....I went back home with a heavy load of stuff and aching legs...I was practically stoning when I bathed while trying to remove the gunk on my hair.... I am so glad that it's all over...one huge burden off my shoulders....dun haf to shout at them again !!!  Happy...sha la la la.....

      I am finally blogging an event that happened juz a few hours ago. Today is finally the BIG day...ANDnovators Fair and our veri own Andersonian Idol !!!! Stayed over at Puay Fen's house yesterday..... we reached home at onli 8.30 pm cos we had to help clear up the ice-cream mess and incoming sales....  Well, as I was saying...the BIG Day todae....I was in-charge of the Andersonian Idol together wif Agnes....didn't noe what to expect realli but was quite surprised that the audience group was quite big.... I almost had a heart attack gathering all the contestants...all of them run here and there cannot find...but in the end everything fell into place.  Sum of the contestants were rather out of tune...they were probably very nervous Amos totally roxs lor...he sang Robbie William's "Better Man" and played the guitar so well...and he sounded like a professional star...I dare say he sounded on par with Robbie Williams maybe even better...so cool lorx !!!! He is obviously our Andersonian Idol !!!! Our Ultimate Group was taken by 19th Plunge, Nizar's and Hashir's group...they composed a song about snoopy.... it was so funny but they sounded good with their instruments !!! I think the groups were rather desperate to win the most popular title.... some of them like spent $50 to $100 dollars on voting for themselves and oso getting their friends to vote for them. So Extreme.. Our food bazaar was also very good....a lot of people came to buy food cos we had no competition.  TOTAL EARNINGS : Around $2000 we were all so shell-shocked by the success...we din expect so much and it is the first time I have seen such a huge stack of notes....haha !!! That means more money for the DS ppl...rock on !!!!  Tmr is church funfair...two funfairs ina row...bow wow !!! Hope that people will buy my smoothies...I will make it is drinkable and nice...haha.....not like the last time !!!!

      This few days have been a killer and I actually feel like sleeping now.... My IPW group have been veri busy cos we are holding our veri own Anderson Idol this cuming Sat and we are oso manning a food bazaar so as to raise more funds for charity. So co-ordination was number one on the list which was rather difficult to get. Wednesday was a visit to the Down Syndrome Association or DSA for short...their facilities are actually rather nice and I got to meet sum of the 'clients' as they name the DS people...I find that they have a type of innocence that is veri rare in normal people and they live a veri contented life. How nice if we could be like them...to take a step back in life !!!! Today was normal hectic day...we had lessons until 4.30 pm...almost wanted to 'peng' on the table but managed to keep my composure. Had sum misunderstanding which fortunately cleared when I came back...this shows that we should have good communication between each other...sighz.  Gotta write my reflections for the DSA visit....

      hmmm.....I am once again blogging the event the day after.... Yesterday was Celebration Sunday. I woke up on a bad note cos my throat hurts like nobody's business. The service was at 5 pm so there was nothing to worry....first time going to church so late...haha !!! Anywayz...I reached church at abt 12.30 pm to discuss abt the funfair...but in the end we were all slacking away and crapping...in the meantime getting my nails painted by Wenshan...Theodore, Marcus and Chang Yuh brought fish and it was quite sad seeing a fish floating in the container after a while. Life is so vulnerable. I tried the chilli expt on Wenhao and once again I got smeared back...haiz...bad positioning but good thing it was onli on the hand !!!! Went to The People's Bible Church at around 3.30 pm.....put on make-up and tie my hair up in braids...stuff stuff....prepared for the dance....looked a bit like small girl but I think Lynn looks more like it...haha !!!! Finally...after hours of awaiting...the service started and we were the first item on the list !!! I juz danced and didn't care abt anything....I felt joyous thruout the whole service...indeed Celebration Sunday !!! Helped to clear up after the whole service....Theodore, vic and I were so clumsy vacuuming the floor that we have to stop after every few steps...so funny !!!! Reached home at 9.30 pm feeling rather tired but oso excited becos of Euro 2004 !!! Time check: 2.00 am....I woke up feeling so high and hungry !!!! Puay Fen called and we spent the whole time discussing abt the match and she, as usual checking out the cute guys.(she said the Greek goalkeeper was quite shuai...but anywayz I beg to differ...haha!) I had no favourite team to root for but in the end I decided to root for Portugal. It was so infuriating that they lost so many chances to score a goal. Oh, Figo, where were you when we needed you??? haha.... Sadly Greece won the match....I did not feel anything lar cos I wasn't realli that crazy abt Portugal or Greece. I'm sorry Denice, but I still think Christiano Ronaldo look so gay with his scotch-taped ear...and it's a bit of his fault that they lost(he missed a few goal-scoring chances)...sighx....Scolari must be so sad...... That's abt all I will blog for now....nothing to write abt todae....

      Hanging up my 'sick' sign once again, I had a terrible tummyache and couldn't go to school. In actual fact, I went to school cos I thought it was just like last week's pain where it wasn't tat bad. I was proven wrong. Terrible spasms in my stomach and the feeling of wanting to puke came&nbsp;this time and I almost fainted on the street but I told myself I had to get to school.&nbsp;Ok, well I got to school and&nbsp;started revising for my maths but the pain just wun go away. I had to restrict myself from trying to puke. Puay Fen came in and saw my face....asked me to go home...so after sum thots...I decided to to catch a cab to go home. Reached home feeling dizzy,&nbsp;reached for the phone to call mum, went to see a doctor. Doctor said it was a bit of indigestion and no strenuous work for the weekend. And I was still thinking of going to Wild Wild Wet !! What a disappointment... Came home and&nbsp;slept for 2 whole hours cos the medicine knocked me out&nbsp;and here I am now, blogging...haha!!! Gotta go do sum work since I have the free time !!!!

      Todae was a 'after-effect' day....I exerted too much energy at the funfair yesterday that I almost fell asleep during Geography lesson. Right...the funfair!!! I had so much fun at the funfair !!!! My smoothies din work out cos I was too slow and panicky.... After failed attempt no. 4, we decided to drop the idea and turned to selling ice-cream, the result turned out to be not bad although the ice-cream was Mr. Softee !!! haha..... At around 2 plus, almost everything was sold out except the milk, thus wenhao and I decided to drink the milk. Bad choice...I ended up having a bloated stomach for quite a while. In the end, we managed to sell everything, from orange squash to iced milo...thanks to melvin and wenhao who thot of it first !!!! We worked till 6...and I was so tired when I went back and this resulted in todae being tired...haha!!!!  Well, todae was o level chinese oral....I was so nervous that I kept stumbling in front of the invilgators...and they all from China some more....I have to count on my paper to get my A1 !!!! sighx. And I realli have to work on my chinese vocab...big time !!! Feeling sianz now..so tired..dun feel like doing anything.

      Hmm....I have no idea why my blog posts become like tat...bear with it for a while peeps...I will fix it soon. Anywayz, yesterday was Racial Harmony Day. Ehh...no...actually it was Wednesday but our school arranged to celebrate it yesterday. Setting all my unhappiness aside, I went to school with a super light bag for the first time !! Haha..... Changed into my ethnic costume which was a Chinese 'shamfoo' (at least I think it is spelled like that). Everybody that saw me said I&nbsp;looked like 'little girl'. Haha....probably becos I tied my hair in two plaits. We had a super long assembly, I&nbsp;was wondering why there is a pledge and theme song this year. Hmm....probably&nbsp;religious issues are very sensitive this days. We had this 'Colours of Harmony' performance that my class was involved in. We were actually sort of forced into&nbsp;this cos we thot it was compulsory. In the end, we were the onli upper sec class performing. Haha.... But it was quite fun lah...haha After assembly, I went&nbsp;around eating kah-ciam-pu-teh and exploring the different booths in the school. I had a&nbsp;shot at&nbsp;jumping on the skipping rope, so nice to relive my childhood days&nbsp;! We had our fire drill outside the school. I think it was quite stupid cos everybody was stuck at the stairs and it was totally uncomfortable standing under the big hot sun! We would be burned to death by then if there was a real fire.  We had our NAPFA test(5 items)&nbsp;at 3&nbsp;pm, Quite satisfied with my results.&nbsp;B for sit-n-reach,&nbsp;A for inclined pull-ups,&nbsp;A for shuttle run,&nbsp;A for sit-ups and&nbsp;A for standing broad jump. So now I am hoping&nbsp;for at least a C for my 2.4 km run. My stamina is getting worse but it is easier to run&nbsp;in the stadium than outside the school. After NAPFA, 15 of us, namely Puay Fen, Yating,Vivan, Zhengrong, Teng&nbsp;Kiat, Kok Yeow, Boon Hong, Xue&nbsp;Lin, Chengyi, Edmund,Teck Beng, Chee Sheng, Zuo Jie&nbsp;Jason&nbsp;and me went for dinner at McDonalds'....so much for physical fitness !!!! I didn't noe&nbsp;McDonalds' service was so efficient, the employee actually came to our table to take our orders !!! Probably he saw us as alarge group.&nbsp;I have never seen so much fast food&nbsp;in my entire&nbsp;life !!! There were about 6 full trays + 1 tray of sauces !!!! Haha..... Went to Singapore Expo for rehearsal for the MRMR nite...crapped all the way there. We had so much fun laughing away. Edmund was swooning over sum Eurasian girl there and he is realli afraid of radiation from handphones&nbsp;cos he is scared that he will be impotent !!!

      Emotions, one thing that is most difficult to control. Many thots came to my mind as I&nbsp;was making&nbsp;my way home todae.&nbsp;I am so tired of trying to control my true feelings as I feel so hypocritical. I may appear as a very cheerful and crazy girl on the surface but in actual fact I am a&nbsp;vulnerable and unhappy person inside.&nbsp;I used to be able to express my thots and feelings to people, but now, I tend to keep everything to myself.&nbsp;I realli cannot find anyone that I can confide in except God and sumtimes, God seems distant. It always seem that it is onli myself. I dun talk much unless needed, even people have noticed the change in me. I may be misunderstood as being too laidback and having an attitude. I feel that people around me seem to be more and more annoyed with me and it is totally disheartening. In actual fact, I also hate myself like that, being all cooped up. I am so afraid, realli afraid. Nothing can fill the emptiness in my heart.  I am such a failure. With my schoolwork. In my church ministry. With my life. With my family. With my friends. With almost everything.  What on earth am I here for?

        Ballet shoes- beautiful, graceful, and creative, you enjoy dancing writing and music.&nbsp; You are often very poetic and sometimes dramatic.&nbsp; Even if dancing isn't your thing, you are still very creative. You keep to yourself aside from a few close friends that you can relate to. You find your own ways to express yourself and don't have a need to br surrounded by tons of people. A small group of friends is fine. [please vote! thank you! :)]    urlLink  What Kind of Shoe Are You?(new and updated results!!)    brought to you by  urlLink

      Todae was quite normal.I went to church in the morning and it's the first time we're resuming our Sunday School, a bit strange after 7 weeks of service only...haha !!! Anywayz we learnt abt Psalms todae and I think it is a very beautiful book although it is long. It is my favourite book of the Bible. Sharon explained to us the basics abt Psalms and then&nbsp;we were asked to write a letter to God. As I sat in my corner to write, emotions overwhelmed me and I just kept writing and writing all I could pour out to God&nbsp;and also thank Him for giving me strength to go through all these in my life. Did not have the guts to let Sharon read my letter out...found it too personal. Onli&nbsp;Vic had the guts and I realli admire her sumtimes for her 'enthu'ness !!! And here's to Vic: Dun worry so much abt what people think abt you,&nbsp;all it matters is what God thinks ! It may hurt big time when people wear u down, but take that as a lesson to make u&nbsp;a stronger person. Gotta go do my work....so many tests next week!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

      You can guess from my title, yep I am sick once again ! Probably becos I had not enough sleep from the MRMR Nite, so I started sneezing from Sunday. My nose hurts from all the abrasion from tissue paper. It's amazing how&nbsp;I can use so much tissue paper in such a short time, 4 packets in like about 5 hours !!!! Haha..... Anywayz, apart from sneezing, it's school, school and still school. How boring can that be? But what can I do, I need to slog for my results !!! So many tests are cuming up.....sighx. Besides studying, I have noticed&nbsp;a few&nbsp;trends these few days....  Trend 1:&nbsp;The 'in' hairstyle in my school nowadays is&nbsp;e 'punkish' look. Many girls have their hair cut till super short and I think they look quite cool.&nbsp;I will probably&nbsp;cut like that after my 'o' levels. I still want long hair for prom.....haha !!! Or they will cut a fringe.....  Trend&nbsp;2:&nbsp;Many people seem to be talking in codes although I noe what they talking abt.  Life is still rather okay. And I just found out that my sis has a blog and she is using the same template as me...haha !!! And she is using MSN messenger....to think that she was scolding me for using it...haha !!!  Well, that's abt all for now.

      Yesterday's MRMR Nite was totally smashing !!! Reached school at 4.30 pm...had a little frenzy with Yating's sari cos it was so totally intricate and difficult to wrap !! I seriously admire Indian women.... Reached Singapore Expo at around 5.30 pm, nothing much to do cos there's no need to practise holding placards....haha !!!! Yep...we went for this just to hold placards at the finale...a bit stupid rite? Trooped down to Coffee Bean for a short break...oohh...mocha !!! Vegetarian dinner started at around 7 pm (yep, it's vegetarian), the first few dishes were still all rite but as the others came along, we got so sick of "mock" chicken and stuff that we had to play "zhong ji mi ma" to finish the food !!! We never realli finished it....our stomaches were so bloated !!! Performances were okay.....as usual teasing Edmund with the Eurasian girl !!! Cracked a lot of corny jokes... Joke of the Year: This particular waitress poured tea into Edmund's cup of plain water and could still say she was performing magic !!! We laughed till we were almost rolling on the floor.... Another one was this waiter who poured water into Yong Chun' cup till like its brim...practically full till spillage point !!! Haha....  Well....reached home at around 11.10 pm. Still totally zonked out at the moment.

      Finally found sumthing to blog about todae... Hmm..... Took my height and weight on Tuesday(shan't reveal) and I am still a fat pig !!! Sighx... Still look veri inproportionate for nuts !!!! Haha.....I am going to LOSE weight !!!! Although God loves every boy and girl, whether short or tall, rich or poor, fat or thin...there is still a tinge of dissatisfaction that I do not look or feel the way I want. Took a run around the estate juz a while ago and I am kinda pumped up now....getting into the 'healthy' mode !!!!  My killer history test is finally over. I am so HAPPY !!!! It gives a great sense of relief and I kinda feel that all my tests are over although I still have my three sciences and social studies !!! Self-denial...haha !!!  I am yearning to go swimming... "Juz keep swimming, juz keep swimming, juz keep swimming, swimming, swimming." I am dying to go to Wild Wild Wet and get a spin on the tubes but one thing that puts me off is the long distance. And when I say long, it's realli LONG !!! Sighx.... A long break at the right time...yipeee !!!! Why am i saying everything 'long'...haha !!!!

      Well, I promised to blog about NDP but it's like three days ago......never mind !!!! I personally thought that NDP was very vibrant this year. There were more colours and the fireworks were spectacular !!! It would have been better to see the real thing, but since I do not have the chance, I shall settle for sumthing smaller. The performances , what can I say, totally NORMAL as of the past years but I really 'wowed' at every coordination. Theme song was "Home" once again, it was very soothing hearing Kit Chan sing that song once again. Only she has the voice to carry that song well, other versions were a bit weird...like JJ's hip-hop version, it sounded okay but a bit funny as well....haha !!!! NDP ended on a patriotic note with the usual songs like 'Count On Me Singapore'. Always end with the same song.....haha !!!! Next up was Singapore Idol !!! I was so totally looking forward to it....    A few significant contestants:   1. The Lemon Tree guy was totally hilarious. Well....I do agree that he's better than William Hung...at least his movements weren't retarded !!! My sis and I were practically rolling on the floor when watching that !!!  2. The eyebrow plucker guy was so totally 'out' ! The striptease was totally uncalled for !! Senseless realli.....  3. The soft voice guy was another funny guy who insisted on comments. Weird when the judges couldn't even hear his voice.  4. The opera guy's voice is good but as what the judges have said, he is suitable for Opera Idol !!! Should have known that they are looking for popstars !!!  Well, about all I will blog for now !!! Till next time....I am Deborah, signing off !!!

         For all Singaporeans out there, Happy 39th Birthday Singapore !!!     It is quite an irony sumtimes for us Singaporeans as we onli feel the patriotism during National Day, which is like onli once a year !!! So sad realli... We are a totally 'rojak' country with so many races and religions, resulting in no distinct culture like Japan or Korea...but I guess it is a good thing in a way, at least we get all the good things, I still want my mee rebus and roti prata !!! Haha..... Well, let me review what I have been doing over these long weekend !!!     Fri:    We had our usual National Day celebrations and as usual Andersonians are to be innovative, we had the very first Anderson'Yeah' T-shirt !!! The idea of 'Yeah' is rather lame but it's quite cool seeing everybody wearing the same T-shirt and I am starting to like wearing it cos it's quite 'cooling'...Hehe !!! Went to be a garang guni for a few hours as we went along collecting old newspapers. Sighx...the result is so disappointing cos my group onli managed to collect from one house. Pathetic rite ? The rest of the residents either refuse to open the door, think we are salesmen or they are not even at home, considering that it is a fri morning and they do not have the luxury to have a half-day off at work.... Slacked all the way till choir in the late afternoon and the rest is period.     Sat:     Nothing much to blog realli cos I spent the whole day at home, slogging for my tests. Probably the idea of a long weekend got into my head and I din realli do as much as I expected...haha !!!  Watched a bit of TV at nite and there was this "Idol" show on Ch U which realli showed the difference btw the beautiful and ugly !!! There was the particular girl who was veri sweet-looking, it is understandable why she got thru the first round cos she's pretty and got the X-factor. But I dun understand why she can get thru the second round. She totally can't hold a tune !!! She started out quite okay, acceptable to the ears but when she got to the more difficult parts where she have to hit the powerful notes, she totally screeched !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To think no one from the audience voted her out, so biased !!! Sighx. The power of beauty...... Thus she went to Taiwan with two other girls who can hold a better tune than her !!! Their first task was to do a recording of a song on the spot and the judge was Lin Zi Liang !!!! Bad taste totally....never liked his voice realli...sound too airy and as u may have guessed, he chose the girl when the other two could sing better !!! Double sighx. Once again the power of beauty, should not have gotten a male judge !!!! Haha...... Therefore, she ended up being the "Idol of the Week" which in sum way she deserves it and in sum way she does not !!! Hehe...no offense !!!  Sun: Went to church as usual...everybody was kinda relaxed cos it's the hols !!! Sermon was on PROBLEMS. It's realli amazing how everything in our lives can be closely related to what the Bible says..... Mission trip....I am so looking forward to it, I will continue praying for it !!!!  As for now, I shall blog tmr abt NDP !!!! Haha...     Once again, Happy Birthday Singapore !!!!!
