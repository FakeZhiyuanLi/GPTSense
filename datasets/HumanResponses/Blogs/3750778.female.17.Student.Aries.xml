      Taking senior portraits was a blast!! The photographers where so nice,they made me laugh a lot! They had music playing and I was dancing around and stuff. I got some pics taken with my french horn and stuff but my favorites were the outside pictures. There were horses in the field next to the place and the guy(Bill Miller) said that they were ornery and most people didn't get to take pictures with them, but guess what... I did! aha Miller was like now feed her, but don't feed her, and look at the camera, now don't let her get the grass yet, but look at the camera! I was like ook you're trying to get my finger bit off! Anyhow Micheal Hill came in right after I did and then Lee did his.. but I think overall they are going to be some good pictures(expecially the ones outside!!). So now I'm tired and I'm gunna take a nap!!

      I am sitting here all made up waiting to go for my senior pics, and I'm thinking to myself 'why do we put ourselves through this'? I have come to the conclusion that people are generally just plain stupid, and that is why we have to look our best and take pictures to show it off(not like mine are gunna be any good or anything). So while I wait I am gunna rant about how superficial people generally are. Why do we have to look good? I have no problem looking like a slob and going out in public, I do it all the time. But to some people if they see someone looking grundgy they think that that person is poor or stupid or something. Just because I don't feel like taking 30 minutes out of my day to fix my hair or put on make-up or pick out cute clothes doesn't mean I am poor and it doesn't mean that I don't care about myself. It just means that I don't care what other people think and maybe I just don't feel like it! hmm I feel better now. Hee, well I am off the see the wizard, wish me luck!

But anyhow, it is really hard for me to type right now because me cat is sitting on my hands. EW and her butt is in my face! She likes to help me type. Good kitty *stab*.   So today Micah and I went to church with Matt. They had this big Extravaganza with singing and a comedian and all kinds of kids games(I didn't get to play though). I just got done coloring Micah's hair... but it's ok I think it's pretty. It's really red.. I hope her momma doesn't freak out.  I guess that's all, I need to go do some work on getting this blog set up.. hmm dangit!

      I don't feel like I am any better than you, or anyone else, but I feel like I can't lie to myself anymore. I still want to be your friend but there are things that I am responsible for now.&nbsp; And about being offline so much, well that's because I have been spending so much time online that I put off the things God wanted me to do. He is more important to me. I hope you understand that I love y'all very very much and you all are my best friends. So much love, and see you when school starts.

      OOOO I got so stoned, so high, so jacked up this week. I have never felt so good in my life. But I have never felt so much pain, so much sorrow. O God I wish you could understand! I didn't get messed up on drugs or other popular things, I didn't go partying, I went to church! and I don't mean the kind of church where you sit in your pew and sing hymes. I mean the kind of church where you actually praise God! Think about 2000 teenagers jammin out , worshiping God! God has been so good to me. He has forgivin me and anointed me with his fire! I will never be the same!   This generation that we were born into is a generation of EXTREMES. The way we do our hair, the way we dress, the loud music we love. We are not satisfied with just sitting in church and listening to some old man talking about the same old thing! We are not satisfied with sitting around singing the same old hymes. We want more! We want a more ETREME JESUS! The time is now! We are all called but few are chosen! And I am chosen! and I am willing to do whatever it takes! I am willing to sacrifice everything that I have, all friends, all relationships, all extra corricular activities!   This is me stepping out in faith. The world doesn't believe in God because they have never really seen someone who does, someone who really follows him and does his will. Now I take up the cloak of old evangilists, raticalists, and preachers. There is no stopping God. This is the generation that will change the world! The generation that will Overturn this country!  We are hungry for something, but most of us don't even know what! I have found the only thing that can satisfy. I have found the living water, the bread of life. and I know without a shadow of a doubt that this is the only way the life!   I won't be online much for the rest of the summer, or the school year... or better yet I wont be on for the rest of my life..   There is nothing I can do about this, my life is not my own.&nbsp; I have given everything I have to God and I can not turn back! IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE CHANGES I HAVE MADE, SORRY, I'LL MISS YOU, BYE.   PLEASE HEAR ME, I AM YOUR FRIEND, AND I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE YOU HAVE REAL LIFE!   Awaken O sleeper! It is time to get up and praise the Lord!

      Have you ever been so excited and so calm all at the same time? Well right now I am extremely excited because tomorrow we leave for Florida! But I'm also just as calm as can be... pretty strange actually. Usually I get so excited before going somewhere that I get sick to my stomach and everything, but not this time. I don't know why, maybe because I know what to expect mostly. But on the other hand, I have greater expectations of what God is going to do! OOO I wish you could all come with us!!  Micah, Megan, Lisa, and I went and saw Sleepover tonight! It is so funny! We were the only ones in the theater so we were all loud and stuff. Afterwards Lisa's daddy took us to his printshop(I guess that's what you would call it..) and he made us new T-shirts for our trip! They are cute! We'll I better go, my momma said my online/phone curfew was 9 o'clock. So if she catches me(even though she's already in bed) I'm going to be in deep doodoo!   YAY FLORIDA TOMORROW!!! I'm gunna miss yall!!

      I finally finished packing.. ok well there is still some stuff but it's in the dirty clothes(a reminder to myself). I am so extremely bored! And I'm so lonely..*sigh*.. oh well at least I have Rick...hmm well whatever...aha. If you can't tell I'm posting for postings sake. I really have nothing to say once again. That's the thing about summer in Anniston, nothing really ever happens. At least I get to go to Branded by Fire! It is the most awsome youth conference ever!! And God is actually there! And we get to dance and scream and just be happy! OOO I can't wait! I want to go and get my heart changed! I hope it is 10 times better than last year!! hmm ok ahaha enough of my hoping, I need to go do something...

      OOO have I got to tell y'all something!! We(just guess who) went and saw Spiderman 2 tonight!! It is great!! Much better than the first one. The only problem I had with it was that they used digital enhancements way too much! It ruined the effect, I would much rather see real people hanging from wires than digital images floating throught the air wouldn't you? aha But it's still a great movie!  wow leaving for Florida 3 days.... w00t!

      I feel pain for people who do not know the reality of Jesus Christ, because only he can save us from the lies of Satan. God warns that Satan's ways may seem appealing and often may even seem to be morally right, but he is like a theif or a con-man who only wants to steal and destroy. Jesus, not Satan, loved people so much that he died for us. Jesus alone offers true peace, love, and joy. And he offers it to everyone.

      Last night I was sitting on the front porch watching the storms that seemed to be going all around us. I love summer storms, everything about them makes me smile. The intensity of the thunder and lightening just demands your attention, there is no way to really escape it. Before it started raining I was standing outside watching the wind blow the trees, and feeling the cool breeze against my face. You can just feel the storm in the wind. What I love most about summer storms is the smell of it all. As I see it, the rain always brings out the best in everything, and it gives everything a new perspective. So I was quite content last night and slept very well thank you.

      Oh my goodness!! I hate walmart!! Everytime I try to write an entry it kicks me offline!! That's why I haven't told you about the biggest booboo I have ever had...  Yesterday I went to a gathering at Pastor Danny's house, pretty much everyone from church was there. We ate and swam (in-ground pool w00t) and just had a good ole' time. Well it all started when Lee said to push him off the diving board. Me and Megan were climbing up the ladder at the same time and when I went to get off I stepped off at the side of the ladder so megan could get off through the middle. You following me? Ok so you know those plastic coverings for the filter thing, well I didn't see it and when I stepped off the ladder I stepped right on it and it broke and my foot went in the hole.   CAUTION: WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ MY CONTAIN GRAPHIC MATERIAL. IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACHE I ADVISE YOU NOT TO READ ON.  When I stepped into the hole my shin hit the corner of it and somehow it gashed my leg and pushed all the stuff under my skin up and left a big knot of tissue. It was like you see on those surgery shows, kinda cool actually. So I had to push all the stuff back down so it wouldn't look so funny, it wasn't bleeding very badly though. I swear it hurt so bad I thought I was going to throw up. But I was a big girl and didn't cry (if I would have cried I would have thrown up). It turned into a big knot on my leg, it was turnin black and swelling up pretty big, and I had to walk around all afternoon at someonelses house with tissue hanging from my gash.  When I got home my momma practically freaked out and said I had to go to the emergency room. Um I don't do emercency rooms, so here I am not knowing if I will be able to jump at church Wednesday, or if it will be well enough for me to run around at the beach (We're leaving Sunday). This morning when I woke up it wasn't swollen hardly at all and the bruising was fairly minute, which kinda scared me but oh well, I'm not going to let it bother me... If it hurts it hurts, pain isn't that much of a big deal. As long as I don't have to go to the hosipital or have some kind of cast thing... It'll be ooook...

I ended up coming home from Micah's with much more than a sunburn.... OO but he is soo cute... his name is Christian(I'll tell you the story later..or its probably on  urlLink Micah's joural )...o yea and he's my new kitty... he's soo cute! Right now he is sleeping behind my monitor, hiding from Nakomie(my princess kitty). It's ok I would hide too...

      Happiness is just a word to me And it might have meant a thing or two If I'd known the difference  Emptiness, a lonely parody And my life, another smokin' gun A sign of my indifference  Always keepin' safe inside Where no one ever had a chance To penetrate a break in  Let me tell you some have tried But I would slam the door so tight That they could never get in  Kept my cool under lock and key And I never shed a tear Another sign of my condidtion  Fear of love or bitter vanity That kept me on the run The main events at my confession  I kept a chain upon my door That would shake the shame of Cain Into a blind submission  The burning ghost without a name Was still calling all the same But I just wouldn't listen  The longer I'd stall The further I'd crawl The further I'd crawl The harder I'd fall I was crawlin' into the fire  The more that I saw The further I'd fall The further I'd fall The lower I'd crawl I kept fallin' into the fire  Into the fire Into the fire   Suddenly it occurred to me The reason for the run and hide Had totaled my existence  Everything left on the other side Could never be much worse that this But could I go the distance  I faced the door and all my shame Tearin' off each piece of chain Until they all were broken  But no matter how I tried The other side was locked so tight The door it wouldn't open  Gave it all that I got And started to knock Shouted for someone To open the lock I just gotta get through the door  And the more that I knocked The hotter I got The hotter I got The harder I'd knock I just gotta break through the door  Gotta knock a little harder Gotta knock a little harder Gotta knock a little harder Break through the door  Break down the door

       Tomorrow is our 4th of july bar-b-q...joy. Every year it's the same thing, all we're missing is the monkeys. It starts around 8 in the morning, Dad and 1 or 2 of his brothers(there are 8) start up the 4 or 5 grills that they bring together and cook enough food to feed a medium sized army(that's about what my family is). My aunts bring  a bunch  of food(good stuff)too, and everybody starts arriving around 11. Our driveway becomes a giant traffic jam 3 or 4 cars wide, and even overflows to the neighbors yard. But the he highlight of the party is my uncle Joey and his vehicle. Parked beside the barn in the very back corner of our yard so my momma wont get mad, Joey brakes out the beer and entertains my uncles(horse shoes just isn't the same without someone drunk playing). Noone every gets too extremely drunk, but joey usually has to leave his car here and catch a ride home with someone(the car usually stays in my yard for a month or so because he forgets where he left it). I have such a big family and such a small house that by the time they leave I am just ready to kill them!! Oh the joys of family time....  Branded By Fire in 8 days!!!

      The comment I got on the last entry made me smile, though I was a little worried that they thought I had lost my fire, but I haven't, I am gaurding this flame with all my strength...I was just bored and tired...I am just glad Someone actually feels the same way I do! The thing is, last year we went to the same conference and got all hyped up on Jesus, but the passion only lasted about 2 weeks, which was just pitifull. We didn't understand that we couldn't just go on doing everything the same old way. And we pretty much just ignored God when we found something more interesting. After our Fire died, we tried our best to act like it was ok, but there was no denying the fact that we just didn't have that passion. This year we went with expectations that we would be changed from the inside out. That we would get so consumed by God, that there would be no turning back. and that is just what happened. Now all I want to do is just bask in him, and love on him, and just be with him in everything I do. OO If I could express to you what God has done for me maybe, just maybe you could get a glimpse of why I feel so strongly about Him. I have given Him complete control over everything that I am. God isn't about religion, he is about a personal relationship with his people. That is why our church is non-denominational, we don't believe that the Church that the bible talks about is seperated into baptist, methodist, and blahblah, we believe that it is a united body of "God Chasers" who want nothing more than to glorify the Lord.  heehee okie thats all.... for now.... aha  *Hinds Feet on High Places is a really really good book*

      So... Who should we invite?  Should we just invite everyone we know - or should we be mean about it? (I love being mean) We can't have everyone writing - ( then there would be no one left to read )  lol.  I think that we should maybe vote on people... Okay, so lets get some rules here:  [rules are subject to editing] 1. Member should post once a week. 2. Play nice.  [doesn't mean no cussing - just keep it professional] 3. Individual will not be invited if there is a problem with a current member (IE: if they just don't get along)  4. If two members don't get along - a vote will be held - one might get booted.  ... (this is starting to sound fun...) lol 5. Let's try and invite someone who brings positive energy to the group.  6. Let's invite people that will actually  write .  (I don't know about Jill, but I don't want to go through the trouble of sending them an invite only to have them be quite and never write anything.)  That's all I can think of.  eh.  (don't post a new entry to comment (let's actually use the comments below :P)

      A hip young man goes out and buys the best car available: A brand new Ferrari GTO. He takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. &nbsp;An old man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man looks over at the sleek, shiny car and asks, "What kind of car ya' got there sonny?" &nbsp;The young man replies, "A Ferrari GTO. &nbsp;It cost half a million dollars!" &nbsp;"That's a lot of money," says the old man." Why does it cost so much?" &nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!" states the young dude proudly. &nbsp;The moped driver asks, "Mind if I take a look inside?" &nbsp;"No problem," replies the owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Then, sitting back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!" &nbsp;&nbsp;Just then the light changes, so the guy decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! &nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly, &nbsp;&nbsp;WHOOOOOOSSSSSHHH! Something whips by him, going much faster! &nbsp;&nbsp;"What on earth could be going faster than my Ferrari?" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. &nbsp;Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. &nbsp;WHOOOOOOOSHHHHH! He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Astounded by the speed of this old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not 10 seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! The Ferrari is flat out, and there's nothing he can do! &nbsp;Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. &nbsp;The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive! He runs up to the mangled old man and says, "Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?" &nbsp;The old man whispers with his dying breath... "Unhook... my...suspenders... from... your... side-view mirror."

       Not  going to orientation.  Fat Granny is going to phone in my schedule changes/requests.  I  DARE  someone to screw it up.  I'm also going to see if I can  reserve  a parking spot/locker (i'll  GIVE THEM THE MONEY THEY SO CRAVE  via Alesha)  I feel that they could at least extend me that curtousy seeing my parking spot was un-avalible to me half of last year becuase of someone parking in it. :P  Also, my locker didn't have 'hooks' in it, dammit.

      OKAY.  "Orientation is July 27-seniors at 9, juniors at 10 and so on! and  lockers went up to $15  and  parking perments are $20!  Plus you have to pay any unpaid fees before you get your new scheduales!! "  Info. stolen from  urlLink Rachel .    Sigh, I really hate comming back to Anniston.  I'm just comming for the orientation and then i'm comming back. [PCB,FL] *giggles* Bringing Alesha back with me.  As Rachel found out when she came down with her church, sometimes I get extremely lonely.  Especially during the day when Fat Granny is at work. -_-

This is the best entry I've seen ~~~~   Things I am looking forward to, Matt:  *in order* urlLink Fullsail , turning 21 and getting completly drunk for the first time, getting laid, taking over the planet, etc. etc.  Things I live for: My family, my friends, coffee, coffee-flavored ice cream,  reading  urlLink bill's  weblog, argueing with idiots,  like you , on the internet,  etc. etc.  So don't say I've got nothing to live for, I have  plenty  of things/people to live for.  So go outside and hump a goat or whatever it is you do in your spare time...

      The heaviest element known to science is Managerium.  This element has no protons or electrons, but has a nucleus made up of 1 neutron, 2 vice-neutrons, 5 junior vice-neutrons, 25 assistant vice-neutrons, and 125 junior assistant vice-neutrons all going round in circles.  Managerium has a half-life of three years, at which time it does not decay but institutes a series of reviews leading to reorganization.  Its molecules are held together by means of the exchange of tiny particles known as morons.

      Look why dont yall just leave Micah alone? Yall know that I am undecided about all this stuff but still. Micah you came on to strong and yall dont down her religion... She said her piece and yall said yalls now can we go back to one happy blogger team!?!? Please! I respect what everyone said considering the circumstances but still It is just way to touchy of a subject to be goin on about... it can ruin friendships... believe me i know! But yeah.. thats all im gonna say about that subject! Oh and does anyone know what day orientation is? Id appretiate (sp?!) it if yall told me.... cuz i dont ever go by the school to see... love yall! -Me

        Ok, this needs to be said. Everyone shut up about the religious bullshit and keep your opinions to yourself. I'm tired of coming on here and religious arguements is all I see. Everyone believes in different things.  Everyone  thinks they are right.&nbsp; No one knows for sure. No one, Micah. Christianity is no different from other religions in terms of belief. Do you not think other religions have holy sacred documents and shit too? I could sit here and argue about my truths, and what I believe in.. But I won't. There is no point. No one is going to change from one of our rants, so we might as well waste time on something else.&nbsp;So did you catch my drift? If not, here it is, condensed: Shut the hell up about your stupid religions, no one wants to hear it.

      i meant to mention this....ppl are soo decieved b/c they think that sayin a prayer will get them to Heaven...its not about the prayer...its about surrendering your whole life to God...i mean he gave it to you....so give it back to him....i am not saying you cant have fun..hey i am all about having some fun...just understand that God is looking for a generation to stand up for him...to love him...he just wants to come and dwell with his ppl..but we have shut him out...dont shut him out no more..its time to kick off the coffin top and get outta that grave.....God isnt boring he doesnt want us to sit in a pew and stand up and sing your fav. song then sit down then the pastor preach the same message....he wants us to be radical..if yall could have just been there...if you coulda seen how all 2000 teenagers were responding to God...i mean screaming, dancing, singing, crying, lifting their hands..it was awesome...worship is the only way to defeat the Devil..it makes him tremble....he knows what kinda worship God wants....remember the Devil use to be the worship leader in Heaven but he wanted to be greater than God he wanted worship so he was sent to hell and&nbsp;he pulled that worship outta Heaven and perverted it...as you see on MTV.  &nbsp; Dancing was made to worship God....how can you be at a football game or watching a concert by Britteny Spears...and scream your head off and dance and jump up and down...and then come to church and sit in a pew and just sing a little song and sit down....God wants you to worship him and love him with all your heart...please understand that....and if you dont or if you have any questions feel free to ask me...i want to help you....i love you with alllll my heart and soul........

PLEASE!! I am begging you....dont let the world control you..i know you dont think it is but think of this....if your not serving God then who are you serving? Yourself? The World? The Devil?? Well if you said yes to any of these...then your serving the Devil its one or the other....God or Devil...there is no in between...but God loves you....he sent his ONLY son for you...do you understand what that means....Jesus beared all your sin just so you would have the chance of going to Heaven....he was beat...it says in the Bible that you could even tell he was human...then he was nailed on the cross and hung there for 3 hours and died...his lungs collapes..all for you......he loves you so much....and he just wants you to love him but the Devil, he hates you...he wants you to die and if he could right now he would come outta hell and drag you down there with him....he desipes you..he just wants you to suffer....but its your chose no one else can choose for you....and i am just telling you this so now your blood isnt on my hands....if yall want to know more about God and want to live for him then ask me about it....email me or im me...do something..my email is&nbsp;~~~~>  urlLink crimsongrl08@hotmail.com  but has i said if yall hate me then thats ok too...but i Love you with all i am........

      Okay, by now you have noticed the new posting thingy.  Blogger staff had the following to say about it:  We've just released a new-fangled version of Blogger that'll let you fancify your posts using a feature-rich text editor. Go forth and align, colorify and embolden your words.  But remember, with great power comes great stylistic responsibility.    Notice the part I made bold. :P   Oh, also google bought the picasa company! yay! [The people that make hello]  Anyway, you can now  urlLink get a free copy of picasa .  I haven't tried it...

Can you put pictures on here now without having to use Hello?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, Rick wants me to start posting the comics that I've made. He says they're funny but y'all will probably think otherwise..&nbsp; I'll post some later, I guess. I'm worried about the ACT.. I need to take it.

      I feel compelled to tell you the purpose of this group weblog.  It is a place to share your thoughts, experiences, photos, comics, or poetry in a more mainstream or public environment.  This isn't anything official.  Just a little project that Jill and I started in our spare time over the summer.  I think it will be fun to read after we graduate; well, assuming everyone posts like they should.    The main thing to remember is to share what's on your mind with others.  And, as long as you do that-  you can't be wrong; Because, it's  your  oppinnion.  And, no one can take that from you.

      I just wanted to say thanks for welcoming me in. I'm glad to be part of this which will usher in a new era of boredom and pointless paragraphs.  Really though, this feels important.. Like it's going to be our last piece of communication between eachother before we go off into our own lives. Let this live on. Thank you and goodnight.

      Jill, I think we should just invite everyone for  one  week. (we give them a week of opportunity, to ask for an invite)   then  we can be picky.  I don't think it really should have anything to do with school anymore - although, school will likely be a constant topic.    My week (that I will invite anyone) Starts this  Wednesday, 7th  and it ends on  Wednesday, 14th .  So if you reading this (and it's between those days,  sigh  I will invite you)    ** Note: The only requirments (for me) is that you place a pic on your profile.  And, that you  urlLink follow these rules .    ***  urlLink Rick, shut up and let me ask for an invite...

      No, no, and no! Well just for now. We are trying to figure out what exactly this site is going to be used for, and when we figure it out we'll let you know. I don't want to add people and then find out that they have nothing to say, or that they make oodles of grammatical errors (I would have to kill you!). All that I know is that I want something with substance, we don't want to know every detail of your day! So if that’s all you have to say, don’t even think about asking… I want students (or former students) to be able to express themselves...is that so much to ask?!!

      I've been thinking.  To hell with it.   No , I won't be adding anyone until school starts.  (if I add anyone then - ...probably will)  If you ask me, your barking up the wrong tree.  Been getting a couple of requests for membership to the blog.  The thing is:  ( being brutally honest here )    "You might not write the kinda stuff we're looking for."   Jill and I haven't even begun to decide who we're letting in - I know one thing, "we sure as hell can't let everyone in." :(  Sorry.    If you don't like how slow we're progressing with this "project".   urlLink Start your own .  Don't ask me for help, tho. >0

      I went and bought my books for my classes this semester... spent almost 300 and only got my books for Music, Psychology (why that class has a set of 3 books I will never understand), my biology lab (and the kit for that too), and... well technically I have my basic stats book, but I just have to pick that up from Debs house. $300!! grr... atleast it wasn't my money. hehe. Other than that, I think we might be hiring soon at work... but don't quote me on it and please don't everyone rush down there for applications! Like ya'll would. Yup. I lead a boring life.

      but this year might not be so bad. Except I have only one class with Danna and none with Meagan. *gr* It's not so bad really. My lunch class is ok and in music appreciation we might study about the Renaissance eventually and stuff like that interests me a great deal. Plus I have Mrs Norton this year, so.. yay.

      Hello. It's Katie (or Jessie Adams's little sister-for those of you who have no earthly idea as to who I am). As you can tell, I received an invite to the blog. *searches for something to say...* Well, I don't think my scheldule would interest any of you since none of the other contributors are in my grade. It has to be changed anyway. They put me in percussion band. *sighs* I just hope they can get it right in less than 2 new scheldules (unlike last year.)  -insert dull silence- ...  Wow, such an interesting post. Hopefully I'll have more to say later.

      What would you do if you woke up in the middle of the night and had to go to the bathroom.  When you get to the bathroom you smell a foul stench.  You open the door and a hairy fat stranger is sitting on your toilet taking a slam, reading your newspaper, and drinking your coffee.  What do you do?

        Well since no one has posted in a while I figured I'd just waste some time.. School is almost here again.. I'm actually looking forward to it.  My schedule looks very easy.. I have a locker next to Kyle.. It's going to be weird without any upper-classmen here.. I'm gonna miss some of the seniors... But hey, they're livin the life now...   Anyway,  Rick, are you back from Florida yet? Wish you would have come to orientation.  Oh well. I'm done wasting time now.  Goodbye.
