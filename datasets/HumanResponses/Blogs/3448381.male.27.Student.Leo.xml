       Wake up and brush the stench of automation from your mouth.  I feel the pain of Walt Liquor in my liver and understand.  No we are not the only pilots of the car, but think of how much further and the interesting places you can visit with a co-pliot that can actually drive...  No time?  Time is relative! Time is all around us!  "Time is on my side...yes it is!" -Rolling Stones  Pierce the matrix and make time.  But we must wake up first Neo.  My pre, during, and post wedding thoughts go un recorded in my beautiful leather bound journal collecting dust in the roach infested bedroom furniture currently being used as my living room furniture.  Ink is drying up and not being scrolled like some ancient manuscripts.  So I figure, let's start our writers club again.  This is a call of transformations...from the carefree "woohoo!"-ers we were to the argumentative, intropsective, interrupting "Ehqumi!" we would like to become again.  Pick a day, any day, and make it yours.  We eagerly await Tuesday's for a bit of Chaunscience or Wednesday's for Dj Meli Mel or whatever...  It's the only way to keep our sanity.   See you next tuesday...  Chaunsee

       They say that the future is built on the past.  All ideas spring foward from old ideas.  Therefore, the more of the past that is accessible the more we can create.  I think it's pretty much understood that creativity makes this world just a bit much more enjoyable.  We escape our mundae lives into different forms of creativity.  Movies, music, books, dancing...each of those creative endeavors builds on past traditions.  So why are multimedia companies trying to destroy the future?  They key element to involved with the distribution and usage of ideas is wrapped up in intellectual property (IP).  When I create an idea, it is my intellectual property.  A song, a poem, a picture...all intellectual property.  Man made laws have been created to protect the creator of these works.  People cannot use your creations without your permission.  Sounds fair doesn't it?  I wouldn't want people claiming they wrote something when in reality I wrote it...or would I?  Maybe if I was the type of guy that thought someone else can improve on what I created, then I wouldn't have a problem with someone else using it.  As long as it grew and became something else.  Taking in something that exists, transforming it, and (re)producing it is the basis for Hiphop conciousness, my first CD "food for thought", my second CD "It aint the coffee in my kitchen", all works based or influnced by past works (basically all art), and a new CD i'm working on tentatively titled "It's the soundtrack to this moment: Monkey Magic".  As I said in the liner notes of "It aint the coffee...", the english language has many words which are reused everyday in different contexts.  Why can't IP be used in the same decontextualized way?    There's so much more to this idea of Intellectual property.  My thoughts are a little sporadic right now and hopefully grad school well help me refine what I'm thinking.  Creativity is being stifled.  For a glimpse at some of the work being done in this area I encourage you to go here:    http://creativecommons.org/  I believe what has prompted me to write a little something about this idea is that I have seriously started thinking about ideas for this new CD.  I would love to make a website for all these CDs, put the tracks up on the web and have people download, distribute, and discuss the ideas and topics.  But I can't because they are completely illegal because they are all sampled based.  I am afraid of the legal reprecussions of using someone's creations without thier permission.  What a shame.  The CD will be made and as with the other CDs, only a few copies will be made and handed out to our friends and family.    More on these ideas in the future...  /Chaunsee

       I am a terrible writer, but I am going to give this a shot.   What does it mean to be a father? Is it important to have a father around?   I once thought fathers were meant to be bad people and that everyone had terrible fathers. Once in a class in college, we were talking about the role of the father in American society and I happened to blurt out "doesn't everyone have bad fathers?" I truly thought at that time, for the last twenty years of my life, that this was normal. I guess I was wrong, because everyone in the class gave me a hard time and talked about how great their fathers were.  I always reflect on that day when I am thinking about my father. I see how I have grown from being jealous of the people with good dads to finally accepting my childhood with my dad. As I am get older and more settled with my wonderful husband, I understand more how hard it is to be a father. I will never completely understand the pressures that fathers face. However, what I do know is that I have to accept my father for who he is in order for me to accept myself for who I am.   Thanks for allowing me this opportunity to write.

       "I suspect my place would be a bit of a culture shock to you any way, as it sits on 100 acres and you can't see another house from mine.  Also, you have to drive past 3 trailers that epitomize "Appalachia" with cars up on blocks, confederate flag flying, etc." -Lady I emailed about renting her house in Blacksburg, Virginia.  This is a direct quote from an email I just received not too long ago and so it occurred to me that I wanted to ponder on "this here move" to Virginia (bad grammar intended).    I do have all the stereotypes in my head of barefooted, overall-wearing, strawhat-wearing, no teeth-having, inbred, southern drawl, racist, huckleberry finns named bubba.  Or debutantes named Peggy Sue with golden curls in a pink dress sipping on lemonade on a swinging bench on her daddy's porch which is at the front of the house that used to be the master's quarters of a plantation.  However, I think I lean more to the hillbilly vision because we are close to the Appalachian mountains.  "Dares gold in dem dare hills!!"  Then my logical mind says that this of course is a stereotype and that people won't actually be that way.  But being on the other end of stereotypes, I can tell you that they come from somewhere. There is truth behind it.  So while most people won't be that way, I am sure to run into buba at some point.    My other fear is the opposite.  I also vision the campus of VTech to be filled with young peple from many different places.  Open minds and eager to learn.  Where in the hell did I get that vision?  Do I not remember college?  My fear is I'll be at a party at Hemingway or Mass Ave all over again.  Retard college kids pounding drinks and yelling at the top of thier lungs.  That, inded, is what college is all about.  However, I am on a mission.  I'll probably try and segregate myself from that community which leaves just a grad community where we go to each other's houses with our spouses and have wine instead of beer.  We talk of post-modernism and smoke fine cigars.  But after a while I'll probably want to make cock jokes and chug a beer with some one who understands about HipHop and Platanos.  So I'll segregate myself again.  Maybe at the end of my stay, it'll boil down to just me, Jose, and Leroy enjoying some Buffalo wings and some beer while we watch the George Lopez Show followed by Dave Chapelle.    And what about my studies?  On my way to work today I found myself remembering the times I would sit in the NU library, ready to get some serious work done and then taking a "ten minute" nap to really feel refreshed.  How wrong was that?  Then, during the middle of a really tough calculus 4 problem (which I took twice), I would stop to day dream.  Looking out the window and day dream.  Wondering why this problem was so relevant to my life.  Why wasn't I doing something that I actually cared about.  I didn't care about gradients.  That's what this whole move is about.  Non-gradient, non derivative, non boolean work.    Once while I was drunk at one of the Senior Banquets, I spoke to one of our professor's and he said watching TV is like eating McDonald's, while doing his academic work was like eating Filet Mignon.  I'm tired of my McDonald's diet.  This whole thing is about Love. Knowledge. And Everything in Between.  Peace,  Chaunsee

       The thought for the day: I hate working!  "I don't really like working any more. I guess I need a change. But I also don't know what I should do instead. I thought of becoming a writer - than I could work while lying on the beach ;-) but I guess my prospects of success aren't that good!? " --- The Great Drunken German  It is not that I hate my job.  I just hate working.  I hate the idea of having to get up every morning and walk the path of the commuter.  Every day I look down the road and see a mass of people leaving buses, trains, cars, etc. all on a mission, a final destination.  I usually get the image of the Lady in Red scene in the first Matrix movie where you see one big mass flowing together as one.  I swear it is an entity all on its own.    The road trip for this mass ends at a desk behind a computer where they grow old and fat but in the process learn a good number of tax codes and regulations.    Do not get me wrong.  I do use the word hate rather loosely but in this case, I really assign a strong intention behind.  When I think of the success that my German counterpart talks about, I don’t think about the accomplishments gained behind my work laptop or the promotion I may be up for this coming fall.    Today is not the first time I’ve had this feeling.  It goes and comes.  Some days are better than others.  I think it’s more of my mind and body reacting to the system, rejecting its grip.  I don’t think I’m alone.  Especially since I know that most of you have your employers on your “Fuck You” list.  Shit, a German half way around the world feels the same way I do.  I think we all just haven’t found the alternative.  For some odd reason, I figure that working behind a desk is not the way to live, that's not the way to grow old and fat!  But the real question, the billion-trillion-quadrillion dollar question is: What is the "right" way to live?  Is it behind a desk, where the pockets are sure to grow but the soul withers?  Or is it on my German friend’s beach?  What would we do if we didn't have to work?   I asked a co-worker yesterday if he had all living expense paid and $500 a month in spending money for the rest of his life, would he be happy.  In other words, if given the chance not to work, would he take it?  His response: I think I’d be bored.  I wrestle with this question every day, every time I stare at that river of workers flowing down the sidewalk.  I’m closely approaching my one year anniversary of the commencement of my Euro hippie adventures.  I’ll tell you one thing, I’ve never felt so alive as I did on those trails.  Ask anyone who’s walked that path and they’ll quickly tell you what I’m talking about.  The interesting aspect of the trip was that I didn’t have a damn thing to do while I was there.  I had neither a sole reason nor a purpose aside from finding food and a place to sleep for the night.  There were definitely some ups and downs on the emotional scale but the truth is I accomplished far more personal growth while on those trips than in the last nine months I’ve been taking an active part in the “real” world.   So what the hell keeps me behind this desk?  What keeps me from living a simple life in a small hut in Thailand?  Maybe it's just that my balls aren't big enough.  It did take some balls to walk the streets of Europe and I probably wouldn’t have done it if Danny didn’t kick me in the balls with his graduation present but I’m sure glad I took on the challenge.  I think next time I see a spam email in my junk folder that reads:  "Want bigger balls?" I may just buy the stupid pills. Maybe then I'll make a real move in my life and stop writing these types of journal entries.  Peace  Waltliquor

       "We all got to have, a place where we come from This place that we come from is called home We set out on our travels, we do the best we can We travel this big earth as we roam  We all got to have, a place where we come from This place that we come from is called home And even though we may love, this place on the map Said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at"  -Mos Def  As DJ Meli Mel would sing every time we get into the car, "On the Road Again!". Thugs have bum rushed us like Neno Brown in New Jack City, stripped us naked, and held a shotgun under our mouths in the rain while they showed the world how intimidated we were of them in order to control the "Carter Building".    While these thugs were not the savage drug dealing bastards of New Jack City, they are just as dangerous.  Roaches, ladies and gentlemen, are truly the scum of the earth...right along side Aubin International and Transamerica.  What a pathetic existense the three entitities lead.  While I can philosophize with the buddhist dudes all day, I can never look at a roach and say it's one with the universe.  It's something other and therefore our duty to kill it as soon as possible.  They ran us out.  The fight to keep the apartment would have taken too long and our safety could never be garaunteed.  So we packed like Felix Unger and left, showing up to our Oscar Madison (Sarah) like political refugees.  Just one stop on the refugee trail.  Our next stop is Edith's.  While I am sad that we had to leave our place, I am happy to be back at sarah's and my dream of living with Edith one last time will come true.  A blessing in disguise maybe?  I know Meli is not the biggest fan of the situation because deep down she wants to feel like she is settled.  A little stability in these tumultous times would be nice but it's also exhilirating to be a wanderer.  No matter where we go, we are always where we are, and together we make our family in that place.  So I do see her point on not separating "just for a little bit".  A family sticks together.    But family also helps out.  They support.  And "6 pack friday's" at sarah's and "casita" at edith's is support.  As for those other cock-a-roaches, Aubin and Transamerica...if i could Raid them I would.  If I could Boric Acid them I would.  If I could step on them, pick them up with a tissue, give the tissue a little pinch to squish them and make sure they were dead, then flush them down the toilet so they're carcasses would join the rest of New york city's shit and piss...I would.  Suing them is out of the question.  So here is my official list that I send a big "fuck you" to:  1. Mayonaise 2. Pigeons 3. Cockroaches 4. Aubin International 5. Transamerica  Peace,  /Chaunsee

       Today is my day.  Not because it’s Thursday nor because of any particular meaning this day brings with it, but because today is my day to write.  It’s approximately 8:30 in the morning and while my work begins to pile up in my cube, the desire to delve into the stack seems rather irrelevant.  What does appeal me is throwing a wrinkle into the cycle, breaking the habit of sitting in my cube and pumping out tax files.    The last true attempt at creating a writer’s club focused around the meaning of happiness and success.  So why not pick up where we left off.  Sure, during those days, we managed to bring a sense of definition to the words but we are no longer within the confines of those definitions.  Thus, our new environments, roles, and experiences compel us to form new methods at analyzing the issues.    My recollection leads me to believe that our focus in the past revolved around coining the actual definition.  Although such a finding is necessary, other aspects of the quest merit our attention.  Since the need to break a habit brings me to the writing table, habits will be today’s consideration.    I often find myself engrossed within the habits of life.  I pick one aspect and bam! I’m in it till the finish.  I frequently receive jokes at work for the time spent working.  I usually get, “Man, you’re like a machine!”  Usually, the only force stopping me while I’m consumed is realizing the loss of contact with the outside world and the discomfort brought along with it.  I like to think that we are all somehow connected and where I spend too much time alone I feel disconnected.  Once realizing this disconnect ness, the next step in my process is to find ways to crack the shell, break the habit.  It may take months before I embark on this next step, which may entail picking up a new book, perhaps writing a bit, or taking a long walk or drive.  It may even occur while lying in bed staring at the ceiling.   As was the case last night while my wife lay peacefully asleep, I drifted off.  During these exercises, the mind begins to wander giving moments that free me from the boundaries of life’s routine.   I find myself purposefully (but often unknowingly) getting lost, loosing myself not because of purpose, in search of anything, but more so to see where the thought may lead, letting the imagination run loose.    Through asking certain questions during these episodes of wandering, I often stumble across certain details revolving our existence.  One of which is that if habits are directly correlated with success/happiness, than shouldn’t behavior, as habit’s instrument, influence our degree of success/happiness?  Behavior results from two components: the way we think and how we experience.  By experience, I mean how we allow our senses to dictate our experience.  On the surface, it seems the two are on opposing ends of the spectrum.  How can you truly experience if your mind is rapped in thought?  Reason and thought are linear where as experience is circular.  When you reason, you begin at a certain point and through a process end at another.  As with your IT genius, reasoning leads you in search of the “On” button.  When the senses guide, as often was the case on my travels through Europe, you may end up right where you started.  While I dance, especially during a performance, most of the fun comes from not thinking about the routine but by feeling the music.  But how can you get to the point of being able to feel the music without first having an understanding of the routine, thinking through the various steps it involves?  There must be a balance between the two.  Can we experience without negating our innate ability to reason, that which separates us from all other species?  How can I still ask the questions; search for truth yet accept that there are no answers and if found, only through spiritual forms, which rely on faith in what we’ve experienced.  I can say life is a cycle but just as easily say that it is linear.  The truth is the truth, regardless of how interpreted.  Then again, is truth multidimensional; giving form in two or more contradictory statements?  On the other hand, are we the ones making the one truth into a two-headed monster?  How can we view experience objectively when in the end it is subjective?  We receive joy from realizing a presumed truth while also simply experiencing a moment.  Can we really ignore the natural ability to reason, to think, to engross ourselves in thought?  What keeps me dancing is the joy felt on the dance floor, where thought has no place, where thought diminishes the joy, the formation of it and the eminence of it.  Yet what keeps me at work is the thought process involved in deciphering shoddy accounting records.  Equally, using my “problem solving skills” to fill out a tax form is what makes me unhappy at work.  This may not be far from your frustration of having to deal with switching the “On” button when you rather be in Virginia.

       My call went unheard last week, however I will continue this venture with the idea of "You'll see the light".  Today which was properly aligned with the first of the month I told my job I was resigning and will be going to graduate school in August.  They took it pretty well and an event I thought I would enjoy over this past year met me with nervousness.  I'm not exactly sure why.  However, I could share some moments that made me want to storm in and either quit on the spot or only give them 2 weeks notice (I gave them a month's notice).    Off the top of my head and the most recent was the case of the stupid computer user.  Now I despise most people for various reasons and I guess in classic IT form, I hate most of the users I work with.  However, I usually snap out of that and enjoy working with most of the people at my job.  I never thought I would run into a situation that you would only read in an email forward.    I got the call that the computer was not working.  I went to see what the problem was and indeed to my surprise the computer was off.  Not broken, simply turned off.  Next to the monitor, the CPU tower sits next to it.  Over the front of the case is a sheet with information on it that covers the "on" button.  Above this sheet, there is a Zip disk drive that is used all the time by the user.  When asked why the user didn't turn it on, she replied,"I didn't know where it was."  This is what I must get away from.  My mind tells me not to cal these people idiots and that I am not better than them but you can't help but feel that indeed they are idiots.  Only because they don't have the resoning skills to look at thier environment and solve the problems in front of them.  I believe this is a skill that should be taught to all children.  Problem solving.  Even if you don't know the subject you are confronted with, if you have problem solving skills, you can at least make an attempt.  The simplicity of looking 4 inches to the right, deciphering that underneathe the sheet is a CPU, lifting the sheet, and turning on the computer escaped this poor soul's low mental abilities.    The scary thing is that this person is one of the technicians in charge of scanning patients with a CT machine.  I think I would rather have a pigeon covered in mayonaise scan me before that low level of living.  But I look towards the sky and I see the sun smiling at me.  I know there is a place where I will be soon that will allow my mind, body, and soul thrive...Virginia.   Peace  Chaunsee
