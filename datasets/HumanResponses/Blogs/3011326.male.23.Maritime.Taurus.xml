       And Don't Forget to Feel Good About Yourself.   David Brooks takes another swing at hyper-competitive students, what he calls "project kids," in an  urlLink Op-Ed  in yesterday's Times.  The overall message of the piece is a good one: that high school students shouldn't be obsessed with getting into the "top" college, or be overly burdened by the test scores, grades, and extracurricular activities that are prerequisite at a lot of these places.  But in making this plea, Brooks writes a lot of things are misleading or simply not true, and the average reader who take his advice to heart and actually act on it are setting themselves up for disappointment and failure.   First, Brooks, as only he can, makes generalizations like "[y]ou are being judged according to criteria that you would never use to judge another person and which will never again be applied to you once you leave higher ed." This would be true, if you plan to being a subsistence fisherman in Bermuda or a porn star after graduation. For the rest of us, each step in our professional lives after college will involve being judged and (someday, hopefully) judging others along similar criteria. Sure, no one will care whether you were an officer in your school government; instead you will be asked equally meaningless and even more determinitive questions about your "leadership" experience at your last job.   Second, Brooks makes the outrageous claim that measures like tests scores and GPA will never again be relevant in your life. That's not even true in the narrowest and most trivial sense of the statement, because you will be evaulated by your LSAT, or MCAT, or (at least partly) GRE scores. Not to mention your undergraduate GPA, not to mention your performance evaluations at work, given out by bosses who are, as hard as it may be to believe, a whole lot worse at objective evaluation than your teachers. It is this kind of sovereign disregard for reality that leads to statements like: "Once you reach adulthood, the key to success will not be demonstrating teach-pleasing competence across fields." Right, the key will be demonstrating boss-pleasing competence across competely arbitrary fields (e.g. "is this guy a team-player," or "goal-oriented," whatever those mean).  The last two problems are due to a sanguine view of the adult world, perhaps understandably so from someone as professionally successful and as well educated as Brooks himself. More troubling, however, is Brooks' characterization of liberal arts education.  Brooks writes that it's a travesty that high school students are forced to read things "that are intrinsically boring to [them]," and that the entire system of general education causes students to "stop thinking about which subjects are boring and which exciting," such that "each class [becomes] a hoop you must jump through on your way to a first-class university. You learn[] to thrive in adult-supervised settings." The result of this process for these over-achieving students, Brooks believes, is that they will be "whittle[d]...down into a bland, complaisant achievement machine."   I gather his preferred alternative is that we all become either creative, passionate geniuses or ignorant, incurious slobs (or fishermen or porn stars). Because the purpose of a liberal arts education is to give students the exposure to subjects they may not have considered "intrinsically interesting" simply because they'd never had sufficient knowledge of them.   There is certainly a subset of the high school population out there which should take this advice to heart. But I suspect that those students who are completely sure of what they want to do, and already possess the skills, discipline, and tenacity to achieve their self-discovered goals have enough of a clue not to get derailed by the competitive college-admissions environment in the first place.  But most students, including this one, were largely clueless about most things in high school and for most of college (if not afterwards as well). For us, I think the "achievement machine" is a hedge against the formation of or changes to future goals, precisely because it is undifferentiated in the skills it imparts on those willing to learn, and precisely because it gives us the generic credentials (GPA, LSAT, empty extracurriculars) that will be needed in the place of genuine passion that simpy may not be there. It would be wonderful if finding careers were like finding love, an experience that hits us suddenly so that we know we've found "the one." But I also suspect that most people don't really care that deeply about   any  career, and couldn't give a monkey as long and what he ends up doing satisfies a few basic criteria (pays enough to live on, at least occassionally interesting, etc.). For those us, it is perhaps best to stack up our credentials, because when two (and there will certainly be more) equally disinterested people apply for the same job, guess who has a better shot of getting it?  It's great to send optimistic messages like "the [admissions] letters you get over the next few weeks don't determine anything." But before we decide that our glass is half-full, we better make sure we have a glass, and a way to get some liquid into it.

       Readings on Terror  of the law firm variety.   I came across this  urlLink site  , while reading  urlLink And What Thanks Do We Get , which is a weblog that (we think) is written by a couple of partners are a smallish sounding firm.   But the anonymous writer of the first blog claims to be a hiring partner at a "large firm in a major city," and sounds pretty credible, not that I can really tell. It could be a total sham, just some associate or law student making a joke, but the whole thing does sound oddly sincere at points.  In any event, some of the posts are really funny, but mostly the site is pretty sobering - about the long hours and client demands, and this guy is a partner! But the hiring story in the very first entry is worth citing in length:  My favorite interviewing story is the time I made the law student totally break down. He was a law review kid, from either Columbia or NYU, I think. He asked me what my favorite thing about the firm was. I told him it was the way everyone was so nice to me after my nervous breakdown.   "I explained that I'd been in the office for a week straight, doing due diligence on a really important case, as a first-year associate, and the partner I was working for came in and just started screaming at me, throwing things, telling me he was going to throw me right through the window if I didn't get my act together and start earning my salary. So I started crying, and he took the picture frame from my desk, and slammed it into the ground, and glass went everywhere, and I just lost it, and had to be sent away to the hospital to recover for a few days. But when I got back, I explained, everyone was really nice about it. They only made me work 6 days that week, and even let me grab a quick lunch that Friday.   "So I could tell this kid didn't want to believe anything I was saying, but I kept a straight face through it all. And he asked if I was telling the truth, and I told him I could show him the picture frame to prove it -- that I had the broken picture frame in my drawer, all this time. And I reached for the drawer, to open it, and he quickly said of course he believed me, and wanted to know if things were really that bad.   "I was the last interview before he went out to lunch with two associates, and when they filed their reports they said he was a mess, couldn't stop shaking and fidgeting, asked all these lifestyle questions, and went to the bathroom right after the main course, and they thought he might have vomited it all up. This is power. Making law students vomit. This is why I like being a lawyer.  There are a few other posts that end with comments like "and that's why I like being a lawyer," including one about how he could have made some paralegal copy a stack of papers just because.  This reminds me, I should get an early start at Career Services looking for DOJ jobs.

       "Covering My Life"   I was, and still am, in the middle of eating the worst tuna sandwich I've ever had, when I received an e-mail asking about the URL of my blog. I excitedly wrote back only to find out that the soliciter was really only interested in a friend's blog that's linked on my page - try to guess which, it's not hard.  I indignantly wrote back, and the offender responded that my blog doesn't cover the events of my life. So I thought about posting about how bad my tuna fish sandwich is, but that might be interpreted as too "theoretical."  Other goings-on: I'm flying down to Atlanta Wednesday for the remainder of the week, and will also be there for next week. I get to stay at the swanky W Hotel for most of the time this trip, which should be really neat, even though Lauren said that the place is a little JAPy.   This scheduling change does mean that I'll have to miss the law school reception on Wednesday, which is definitely a shame. I'd really wanted to meet Dean Kagan, if just so I can tell her that her little brother was my favorite teacher in high school. What a small world. Also, there are suppose to be a bunch of young alumni at the event, at least some of whom are probably junior associates (those that can escape for a part of an evening) and it would have been pretty useful to ask them about career stuff.   In baseball news: I dropped LeCroy for Mauer in one of my leagues, which may or may not have been a good move. On the one hand there is all this hype about Mauer and he will be the starting catcher. One the other hand, it takes Yahoo! forever to update players' positions (Chipper Jones was at third base all of last year), and LeCroy will be the DH, so he'll still be putting up decent numbers in my catcher's position.   I'm also trying to compile some semblance of a reading list for the month of May. Columbia's PhD program in political theory has a pretty useful reading list, and I think I'll start with the following:  Tocqueville's   Democracy in America , because it always sounds insightful when people refer to it, and I've never read it.  Freud's   Civilization and Its Discontens . I have no idea what this is about, but I like reading about discontent; and I guess Civilization is... pretty cool too?  Plato's   Gorgias , because it has a funny title.  Now, I have to talk about this tuna sandwich. It's called a "spa" sandwich and it's suppose to be healthy, so they use carrots instead of celery and nothing instead of mayo. And it tastes just awful. Don't ever buy it. Ok, I'm done. Hopefully something more substantive and "theoretical" later today.

       What's in a Name  Staring at several hours of proof reading ahead of me. The material itself is not too torturous, thankfully. Case in point: I came across this guy named Nicholas Economides, who wrote this article entitled  The Economics of Networks . Talk about coincidence, that a guy with a name like that became an economist. I wonder if he comes from a long line of economists. They should totally start their own consulting firm; but people would probably think they changed their names for that purpose, and that would damage their credibility.

       Fantasy Baseball  I did another fantasy baseball draft this Friday, and I thought I drafted a pretty good team, but they it looks really weak based on last year's stats. I think it's because the majority of my guys had years cut short by injury, or are still on their way up as players. So hopefully they will outperform their stats this year.  Anyway, here's my team: C:   LeCroy 1B: Sweeney 2B: Castillo 3B: Lowell SS: Jeter OF: Guerrero OF: Abreu OF: Pierre Util: Baldelli BN: Dunn BN: Ensberg BN: Kearns  SP: Millwood SP: Pedro SP: Brandon Webb SP: Harden SP: Penny SP: Myers CL: Rhodes CL: Percival CL: MacDougal  So, I think I should have the steals market cornered with Castillo, Pierre, Abreu, Baldelli, and Jeter. Hopefully Baldelli will hit for more power this year. And Dunn and Keanrs could give me great years too. We'll see. Another thing, Joe Mauer is still undrafted in my league, as is Shawn Chacon I think. I'd think about picking them up, but don't know who to drop on my team.  Thoughts?

       Before This Blog Gets Outsourced  Thought I'd post something not about the law for a change: a pretty well-argued essay,  urlLink The Outsourcing Bogeyman  by Daniel W. Drezner in Foreign Affairs, on why the flow of white-collar jobs from the U.S. to countries like India is not a bad thing.   One major complaint these days about outsourcing is that too many American jobs are being lost o overseas labor. The loss of white-collar jobs like computer programming and data analysis this time mirrors the loss of manufacturing jobs that started in the 1980s and accelorated in te 1990s. Drezner offers two responses to critics of outsourcing and proponents of protectionism. First, he argues that the claims of the number of jobs lost are often exaggerated for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that the baseline numbers used are often inflated 2000 bubble-economy numbers, or that the rate of outsourcing now is as much due to a management fad as to the long-term strategies of companies. So, the result in the near future is that the gross job loss will not be as high as people predict now.  The second argument is that the  net  loss of jobs will actually be negative, meaning that the flow of certain jobs abroad will lead to more and higher-paying jobs created at home. Drezner uses as his support for this argument both historical evidence and economic dogma. He observes that we are currently undergoing a structural shift in the economy, so that job growth will naturally lag a bit, just as it did during the last such shift in the early 1990s. The result of that shift was the rise of the information economy of which the United States was the undisputed leader. [On a side note,  I just recently read somewhere the use of the term silicon capitalism, which is I gather a variant of or a successor to finance capitalism.] Thus, the current "jobless recovery" is a natural growing pain that accompanies such shifts.   Overall I'm inclined to buy his argument up to this point. I do see a few problems though. First, Drezner, like just about every other free trade advocate I've heard or read, is very vague about exactly the kind of jobs that will replace the jobs lost to overseas labor. He asserts that they will be more numberous, higher-paying, and require more sophisticated skills and training. But what kinds of jobs these might be is unclear. His only concrete examples are jobs that require geographic proximity, like sales and marketing, and the kind of jobs that are likely not be outsources at all, like "retail and restaurants...and personal care." It's hard to believe that any of these jobs are the high-paying, high added-value jobs that Drezner prophesied.  The other problem is not so much a shortcoming in Drezner argument as it is a problem (as I see it, with my near-nonexistent knowledge of the subject) with economic theory. Drezner claims that under ideal conditions, countries would behave much like individual firms do, and produce only those things at which they have a competitive advantage. This way, the economy operates at its most efficient level, and the total wealth of the world is at its peak. But the current trend of job creation and destruction in the United States suggests that, if this continues, the U.S.'s competitive advantage will be in the following areas: Executive Management, Advance Technology, Burger-flipping, and Bed pan-emptying. Now it's great that Americans will have a ton of jobs available to them in the first two industries, but it's really terrible for the people in this country who can't and don't want to jobs in those industries, because then, short of moving abroad, they're left with only the McJobs.   Specialization by firms work for people at large because if I'm bad at or despise one kind of work, I can go to another firm and find a new career. Most people switch careers in their lives at least once. Very few people switch countries. But if the trend towards country-specialization continues, the reasoning seems to me, switching careers may entail switching countries, and that is neither possible nor desirable for the vast majority of people.   Lastly, while Drezner's arguments are designed to counter the claims of people who oppose outsourcing for fear of domestic job loss, it completely ignores the other half of the interest group against the globalization of jobs, namely those who are concerned about the labor enviroment in the countries to which U.S. jobs are moving. It is no wonder why so many companies are outsourcing their jobs abroad - cheap labor. And while there exists economic reasons too complicated for me to understand that explain  why  workers in other country earn three pennies to the dollar of U.S. workers, there is also the simple reason that there are often fewer if any regulations in these other countries, allowing companies to exploit workers to a degree they could not possibly do (at least not all the time) in the U.S.  This last concern could just be economic naivete; it is arguable that the kind of governmental regulations and maket conditions cannot arise without there first being an impetus in the form of mass exploitation. Job growth and exploitation may be a necessary factor in the development of a strong labor market and worker-friendly laws, but surely it is not a sufficient factor. Without a hospitable political environment, there will unlikely ever be the kinds of regulations upon companies that will make the lives of workers significantly better in the long run. Also, governments that are not responsive to the needs of the people are strengthened by the growth of local and multinational elites at the expense of the rest of the population, since a strong middle-class is what authoritarian governments fear most. Job growth alone will not spur the political change that is also necessary for better jobs and living conditions. To think that would be political naivete.

       Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP?  I came across this " urlLink Report of the Task Force on Lawyers' Quality of Life " by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, a fine organzation where I did my "community service" hours in high school - nothing spells community like a bunch of New York lawyers.   As expected, the report was at once vacuous and difficult to read. It dispenses advise ranging from the merely usesless, like "[t]he Task Force recommends that firms endevour to create an environment that recognizes that junior associates lack knowledge in substantive practial areas and are enetitled to seek appropriate guidance while assuming appropriate levels of responsibility," while also chewing appropriate sticks of gum and blowing appropriate sized bubbles - while walking - should those activities conform to the firm's core values, to the suicidal, to the useless and trivial, like analyzing the optimal proportion of paralegals/associates/partners assigned to each secretary.   When I started reading the report I guess I was expecting to actually learn something useful, and in fact I did. I noticed that there seem to be a lot of commonalities between the language of law firms and the language of Communists. What do I mean by this?  For starters there is the propensity to form committees for everything: Executive committees, compensation committees, diversity committees, ethics committees, finance committees, library committees, space allocation committees, sexual harassment committees, morale committees (because nothing improves morale more than the recommendations of a committees, except maybe serving on such a committee) and so on and so on. Compare these committees to ye olde committees on iron ore production and on newspaper propaganda, and of course, to the Politburo, and the Standing Members thereof (which I guess would be the same thing as the Managing Partners...).   Then there is the idea of "lock-step compensation" - paying classes of associates the same salary without regard to job performance - as a disincentive to work hard. Sounds familiar? One of the arguments against the command economy is that without market forces adjusting wages, workers and managers would have no incentive to do more since they get paid the same salary whether they produce the same minimum or three times the minimum.  Also, 64% of large New York firms included in the survey had associates' committees, which I guess is kind of the like firm equivalent of the Communist Youth Leagues, the training group for future apparachiks.   Finally, like communists states, firms are ruled largely by the personalities of a few Great Men; and at this point I think the analogy breaks down, but I still rather like it, so I'll go on for a bit longer. I'd imagine that the "About Us" page on the web site of Stalin, Mao, Honecker & Pol Pot LLP (or just Stalin Mao, as they'd be known) would look something like this:  Josef Stalin:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., magna cum laude (1918); Law Review: Agitation Editor; Order of the Sickle  Josef Stalin is one of the senior partners at the firm. Before forming Stalin Mao, he was a founding partner at Stalin & Associates (formerly Lenin, Trotsky & Stalin), where during his tenure he was an international trail-blazer in the practice area of Gulag law. Stalin's experience include representing plaintiffs in  Collectivizers v. Peasants , which resulted in a verdict of mass starvation, and  In re Great Patriotic War .   Mao Zedong:  Education: Revolutionary University, LL.B., summa cum laude (1921); Law Review: Propaganda Editor; Order of the Sickle  Mao Zedong is one of the industry's top rainmakers in corporate and population re-structuring law. He was formerly the managing partner at the most populous law firm/communist state in the world before joining Stalin Mao. There he oversaw the complex process of deindustrializing an entire country and engineering the stavation of some 30 million people. Mao also holds an adjunct position at Revolution University Law School and regularly teaches a course on Law and Cultural Revolution.   Erich Honecker:   Education: Die Revolutionare Universitat (1969); Law Review: Secret Police Editor; Yale Law School, LL.M. (1971);  Erich Honecker is the lead partner in the firm's M&A practice group. Among his major transactions is the acqusition of his former firm by its arch-rival and westernly neighbor.    Pol Pot:  Education: (Self Taught)  Pol Pot heads the Education Law practice group at Stalin Mao, and is one of the most recognized scholars writing and acting on the subject. He authored the seminal article on the relationship between communism and intellectuals, entitled  Why The Part Needs to Kill Everyone Who's Had More Than An Elementary-School Education  25 Duq. L.J. 317 (1974). Unlike most scholars, Pol Pot was also able to carry out the reforms proposed in his article. In addition to his role at the firm, Pol Pot is also the chairman of the CLE committee at the state bar association.

       Murphy's Law  Left work at 3 AM last night, which itself isn't so bad. What's worse is that (1) poor Russell has been doing this for the last four nights, (2) we're in no better shape for it this morning with the work that needed to get done.  Needless to say disasters tend to happen when you're least equipped to handle them. So this morning we'll have to figure out some way to insert about 1400 pages into the 14 velo bound volumes, and get all of that down to DC in time to file.  On top of all that, when we finally got everything in New York ready to go down to D.C., the only litigation case large enough to carry all of the files had a broken lock, so we couldn't close it.

       Readings on SEX(ual harassment)  Laura Kipnis at Slate has an amusing  urlLink essay  on the Naomi Wolf story. Her basic point is that sexual advances made by co-workers aren't necessarily always threatening and disempowering, sometimes they're just absurdly funny and rather empowering, since it gives these (almost always) women the awesome power of the rejection. Of course, when that co-worker is also a boss, the issue becomes slightly less funny. Kipnis also proposes the idea that men who make these advances, even though they occupy positions of power and prestige, often do so out of insecurity and a need for validation rather than as an exercise in some phallic expression of dominance. The case she picked seems to support her point.   Wolf recently made public her experience of being hit on by her intellectual hero and mentor, the (apparently, I don't know who he is) eminent Harold Bloom, an experience so revolting that she threw up after being propositioned. Wolf, who is now a (apparently, I don't know who she is) famous and respected authority in her field (of something or the other), claims that she is still haunted by the experience.   It is in making this claim that Kipnis thinks is going too far. After all, given Wolf's current position none of the potential harms associated with an unwanted sexual advance exist, and all of the potentially empowering and humorous effects still do. Kipnis advises that situations like this one are not necessarily so uncommon, and that we should not always think about workplace chat-ups as "damsels-in-distress narratives." She closes: "[t]he power actually doesn't flow in only one direction in these encounters, nor does the vulnerability, even when the professional roles are—gasp!—asymmetrical. Sisters are powerful too, even more so when armed with a sense of humor."   Also, an  urlLink article  on a case on the Supreme Court's docket about whether an employer should be held strictly liable for sexual harassment when an employee quits (as oppose to being fired) because of an intolerably hostile work environment. I post this because of the unfortunate name of "constructive discharge" given to the act of quitting because of a hostile environment.

       Even more  on Lawyer dissatisfaction, from Justice O'Connor,  urlLink here .  The anecdote she relates from Stanford is troubling. My stereotyped impression of California and Californians is that people there are pretty laid back in school and on the job scene, at least compared to NY-DC-Boston, but I guess not if the "vast majority" of people she asked about making the same decision all over again said that they would not go to law school.

       And they expect me to pay  how  much in tuition??  It seems that CEO's and Baseball players named Rodriguez aren't the only ones making a killing these days. Harvard University announced recently that it is putting a cap on the compensation paid out to the managers of its endowment investments. Yes, Harvard has by far the largest endowment in the country and one that has grown at an extraordinary pace in the last ten years, but that hardly justifies the compensation these glorified stock-jockies were getting.  The combined compensation for the six highest paid employees of the management company last year exceeded $100 million, with Maruice Samuels earning $35.1 million, David Mittelman earning $34.1 million, and Barry Larson earned a lowly $17.3 million, which was apparently so pathetic that Mr. Larson is leaving along with a dozen or so other Havard Management Co. employees to found their own hedge fund. But don't worry, the money will be following them, as the university has agreed to invest $700 million of its assets with the new company.  I hate being just another student whining about the cost of law school, but these numbers are totally outrageous.

       Suggestions?  I have a reception next Wedneday for all of the incoming first-years to the law school. I definiely want to go, but I'm kind of embarassed by what I'm doing this year (paralegal) because it's so lame generally and particularly unoriginal for law students. So, I've been trying to invent a fictional occupation for myself for this past year, something that's interesting but also implausible enough not to be taken literally. I also would feel really bad lying about doing things that I think are really pretty worthy, i.e. teaching elementary school or anything else socially valuable.   So I was thinking that I would pretend to be the apprentice of the guy who captains the barge that brings garbage from all of New York City to the dump on Staten Island every day (it's a very large, slow-moving boat filled with lots and lots of garbage, cool huh?). But I remembered that the dump closed a few years ago and is not taking in garbage anything. So, I need something new, in  the same vein as my disqualified idea.

       Sights  On my walk from the subway back home today I saw this man, he must have been in his 50's, riding a tiny little bicycle. The bike had a detached car radio stuck on the to handles, and the radio was connected to a small boombox, with which he played loud salsa music as he cruised down the street. I wonder if he needed the car radio because the boombox's radio was broken, but then why couldn't he just get smaller speakers to play the car radio? It was probably a fashion thing; fifty year-old Spanish guys are always the trend setters.   What's next, their own cable cooking show?  The Times Sunday Magazine has a short  urlLink article  about a  urlLink philosophy professor at CCNY  who has his own counseling practice (over which he's currently in litigation against his own university). The guy's claim, which is somewhat plausible, is that many if not most of the problems people go or contemplate going to see a psychiartrist or clinical psychologist about are really philosophical problems that can be solved with the help of a trained socratic interlocutor, i.e. philosophy professors. Lots of times our problems arise from faulty logic or muddled and confused values. Everyone at some point or another has questions about ethics, the meaning of life and happiness, what's truly valuable, and so forth. Philosophers are really best trained to handle these problems, and can do so in less time and at less expensee than medical doctors.   The mental health profession, of course, strongly opposes the idea of philosophers dispensing advice. Their claim, also plausible, is that people who really may need medical help will not be getting it by going to philosophers waxing on and on about Plato or Aquinas or Kierkegaard. One never knows if a philosopher would prescribe Sarte for a suicidal despressive or Nietzsche for a paranoid schizophrenic.  This actually reminds me of an amazingly similar scheme a friend in college had (he's probably not going to read this since he's in Hondurar with the Peace Corps.). His service was called "Justify Your Wrong-Doing," and provides, well, pretty much what it advertises. Say that your conscience was bothering you because you made up some bogus excuse in turning in your paper late, or that you cheated on your taxes or something. Just call and explain your situation, and my friend would explain why your actions were, after all, perfectly justifiable if not affirmatively virtuous. He rates were 50 cents for minor sins, and a 1 dollar for major sins. Considering that, accoridng to the article, executives at companies like IBM and GE have made philosophers tens of thousands of dollars for fancied-up versions of the same thing, I'm very surprised that he never had any customers.   I was thinking though, that head-shrinking is not the only option available to philosophers who want to "practice." So, in no particular, here are 11 promising careers fit for the professional philosopher:  11. Career-counselor. For those philosophers, like Aristotle (who, since he's one of the few philosopher I know, will figrue largely in this list), have a teleology, career-counseling is a fantastic option. So many young people today are completely lost in the wide array of choice available to them that a philosophical exploration into what they're meant to become would definitely be in demand. Philosophers would have this market cornered in no time with advice like "Being a medical orderly is fulfilling your true destiny." Probably only soft determinists or compatibilists should try out for these jobs - see #7 below...  10. Information Technology Manager. For philosophers of mind, this is a perfect opportunity to work all the time with the latest computers to see if they are or can become intelligent beings. Unless you work for a university, in which case you'll have four-year-old technology.  9. Investment manager. For Midieval philosophers. This job normally entails explaining to lots of people why all of their money is gone even though they invested in "hot" stocks like Enron and Worldcom and bubbleEconomy.com. The people with degrees in economics offer explanations like "this is just a market correction," or "the fundamentals of the company are strong, never mind the lack of assets or a business plan," or "I didn't know the officers were all crooks." But only philosophers can tell the straight story, that this is simply all the work of Fortuna, on whose wheel all of us spin from the pinnacle to the nadir. Instead of reading Warren Buffet (I don't know if he even writes anything...), the philosopher investment manager would direct his clients to read  urlLink Boethius' The Consolation of Philosophy .  8. Military Communications Officer. For all philosophers. The military uses a lot of jargon totally incomprehensible to outsiders for every little thing. So do philosophers. This is a perfect match, and you get the added credibility of a Ph.D.  7. Fortune-teller, for the hard determinists, those philosophers who do not believe in free will. All mental functions are caused by chemical reactions in the brain, and these chemical reactions follow the laws of physics. In any physical system, or at least those at the scale of neurotransmitter activity, if we know the current positions and velocity of each particle, we could theoretically calculate their positions into the indefinite future. So, given enough information and calculating power, these philosophers could tell you who you're going to marry, whether you'll make Law Review, and whether you'll ever get rid of that weird looking growth. But the marketing will probably be pretty hard without the crystal ball and all those weird playing cards.  6. Match-maker. For any philosopher who did his or her dissertation on Books VIII and IX of the  Nicomachean Ethics  on friendship. They will know which people are truly meant to be together for life, probably; I don't know, I've never read the  Ethics .   5. Stand up comedian, er, philosopher. This idea was from Mel Brook's hilarious  urlLink History of the World Part I . Philosophers of language would do well in this gig. After all, so many jokes really just exploit the vague areas of meaning and language. "And what's the deal with the demonstrative pronoun? I mean, it's suppose to refer to physical objects, but it's just a signifier for other words! What genius thought of this one?" I think I'd be more worried if that last joke were actually funny...  4. Interior Decorator. Actually, I think phenomenologists have a lot of options for practice, pretty much anything that deals with qualia, or the  experience  of experiencing, that are too vague or complicated for normal people to be want to assess on their own. Restaurant critics would be a pretty good job for phenomenologists. But  feng shui  seems to be all the rage these days, and that's all about the most ineffable of qualia.  3. Fashion Designer. For philosopher of aethetics. This is related to #4. I originally thought that aethetics would be good for interior design since it's nominally concerned with beauty and all that. But actually, just like fashion designers with their weird runway shows, philsophers of beauty seem more concerned with conceptual questions rather than practical ones. Philsophers be ideal for this job, since they can design outfits that no one will ever wear, and still make a good argument as to the value of making them(something about the intrinsic value of beautiful things, like the distant-plant example. E-mail me if you don't know what I'm talking about, or e-mail me if you do know what I'm talking about because I probably don't know what I'm talking about).  2. Taxidermist. Philosphers would make great quality control experts in a taxidermy practice. "Is this elephant stuffed? Is it stuffed now that I've taken out one grain of sand? After two? After three? After four?.... I've just removed the last grain of sand, is it still stuffed? No? Then you better go and stuff it."  1. Lawyer.  Haha, no, just kidding. Thanks for reading the rest of the list though.

       Has the Fear already gripped me?   I report to first-year orientation for law school in 164 days. I won't be allowed to even try to apply for first-year summer jobs for another 92 days on top of that, and I likely will not have to make any meaningful decision about whether and which firm summer job to accept until the winter of my  second  year, or 164+90+365+... well you get the idea.  But I'm already starting to do something that can be called a sorry excuse for research into my employment prospects. I started a spread sheet a few weeks ago, and have been slowly trying to fill in the data points, as if these numbers and boolean values mean anything. Example fields include raw data from the  urlLink NALP  like:   starting salary (which turns out to be the least helpful since they're all mostly the same),  bonus criteria,  partnership length and structure,  salary divided by weekly-hours-worked, associates-to-partners-ratio, summer hiring numbers, size of dinner allowance for all those late nights at the office  and also a myriad of indices, based on surveys from sources like  urlLink this , and  urlLink this :  Family friendliness, Quality of work assigned, Self-esteem, How satisfying work is,  urlLink NYLawyer.com  Misery-Index number [oh if only there were such a thing!]  I noticed that nowhere is my spreadsheet is there a column for the firms' practice area, which, one might think is an important piece of information to assimilate. I think part of the reason is that this type of data is not Excel-friendly, or at least I don't know how to make it Excel-friendly. But it's also because I have no idea what these practice areas mean much less any idea of whether or not I want to practice in them. So, short of finding a firm (or even a partner, really) that specializes in "sitting around discussing stuff that's interesting and kind of related to the law but probably is not profitable for any of our clients, oh wait we don't have any anymore," I don't think listing all of the practice groups will help me at this point.  Not that listing gathering any of this data helps, really. But I think my total indifference to and non-participation in the undergraduate recruiting process, and the resulting clueless job-search for this year has made me acutely fearful of being unprepared when the time does arrive. It also doesn't help that so many people I know, save those who are already locked-in the professional or grad-school track, are having the same if not worse problems with finding a good, satifsying job that could maybe translate into a good, satisfying career.   This is largely just due to my characteristic risk-aversion. [On a side note that's sort of related to risk, I've discovered that Slinkies make excellent spill-guards on one's desk. I'm putting my soft drink cans in the slinky so that I won't accidentally knock them over and spill Diet Coke all over original documents... again.] But a lot of it is also, I think, attributable to the mood of the legal profession and beyond. The attitude among so many intelligent, highly educated, and idealistic people in and out of law school is that money (and the associated security, comfort, and in many cases familial and filial duty) and fulfillment (of intellect and of conscience) necessarily or at least often contingently are trade-offs. Given this trade off, any decision you make will make you either a sell-out, possibly content but probably unhappy , or a pauper, possibly good-doing but probably ineffectual. How to decide!  Of course, the prospects are not really this grim. But I also don't believe that the path beyond this trade-off lies in banal refrains like "just do what you want and what interests you." It's surely a lot more complicated than just an act of will. And I think what drives people into jobs they hate is not just a fear of failure, but a fear of complexity as well. So for those of us who lack Zarathustrian will, a little information-gathering might not be such a bad idea.

       But they're very manly flowers   I dropped off a few shirts at the laundromat this morning, and when the woman working there took a look at one of the shirt I had, she asked if it were a "lady's shirt." Now, in fairness, it does have sort of a floral pattern by the collar and on the inside of the sleeves.  But I wonder what her reaction and thought process would have been had I said, "yes, it is a lady's shirt, and it's mine."   If you've been in the laundromat business for a while, just like if you've been in the photo-developing business, you must have seen some pretty weird stuff that people bring in. I must live in a pretty boring neighborhood if my floral shirt is enough to raise an eyebrow.   The tenure review committee back home won't like this   A really bizarre  urlLink story  out of  urlLink Claremont McKenna College . A visiting assistant professor of psychology reported a few days ago that her car had been vandalized with some pretty venomous racial slurs (she is white). This understandibly caused an uproard on the McKenna and affiliated Claremont campuses. But it turns out after a police investigation that two eyewitnesses positively identified the alleged victim herself as the one who vandalized her own car. So now this woman is in hot water with both the local police and with the school. As far as I've read the professor has not come out to vehemently profess her innocence, which is probably, hopefully, just a legal strategy and not an indication of something else.  What on Earth would possess a person to do this? Did she actually think that this stunt would help the cause against offensive speech on college campuses? But all that's happened is that she's done more to discredit that cause now than  urlLink people like these  could ever hope to do.

       Readings   In the New York Review of Books, Jared Diamond, of  urlLink Guns, Germs, and Steel  fame,  urlLink writes  about two recent books on Easter Island. The story of Eastern Island is amazing in two aspects. First, there are those mysterious giant heads that everyone's heard about. But what is even more interesting is the rise and fall of the civilization that build those giant heads.   It must take both a highly organized society and an island abundant in natural sources (for Easter Island is the most geographically remote place on Earth, so all of the raw materials must have been indigenous) to make possible the quarrying, transporting, and building of these statues. But Eastern Island today is uninhabited and void of trees taller than seven feet. When Europeans happened upon the island they found the inhabitants to be "small, lean, timid, and miserable." What the explorers did not know at the time was that the population of the island declined drastically in the century or so before their arrival, accompanying the general collapse of the island's human civilzation and natural wealth.   Experts on the subject seem to agree that Easter Island is a natural example of the nightmare scenarios projected by environmentalists if humans continue to strip the Earth of natural resources with our present disregard. Diamond wonders if, like we do today, the Easter Islanders thought that technological innovation would save the day before all of their natural resources run out? Sadly, it didn't.   Incidently, I've been seeing all of these ads in the New York subways from BP, about how the company is investigating new energy technologies and so on. And the ads all say "beyond petroleum" like they want you to think that that's what BP stands for. It is, of course, the merged non-representational acronym for British Petroleum (ah,  that's  what BP stands for) and Amoco, the world's silver medalist in oil conglomeration.   And I just realized that I've pretty much summed up an article that is itself a not-too-long book review... I feel like such a bottom-feeder. In my defense, Diamond does refer to the two books in the review -  The Enigmas of Easter Island  by John Flenley and Paul Bahn, and  Among Stone Giants  by Jo Anne Van Tilburg - as "difficult."

       I'm not an grad student; grad students go to meetings....  A very funny piece of what an AA meeting might sound like if it were  urlLink "Grad. Students Anonymous"  instead. That it was written by two tenured professors at Amherst College lends, I think, a bit of credibility to it - we can see that even people who have "made it" went through this kind of crippling angst.  It seems that everything I read about the life of grad students and young phd's is a lot like what I hear about young associates, an endless stream of complaints, regrets, and warnings. But surely  some  abd's and phd's must lead fulfilling lives. Maybe it's selection bias. After all, the  urlLink Chronicle of Higher Education  seems to be a repository of bitching and moaning from humanities students and part-time faculty, presumably because the science grad students and full time faculty have better things to do with their times. The possibility of careers in industy is like a valve that takes some of the pressure out of the academic pipeline for science phd's, but I imagine that physicists, mathematicians, and everyone else interested in basic research are competing for very few spots in academia also. Maybe it's something about the temperment of those drawn to graduate programs in philosophy, history, and the granddaddy of them all, English, that leads to all this agonizing.   Or maybe it is just the reality of the phd program and the job market. One thing I hear a lot about is the pressure to write about the most esoteric and irrelevant topics for your dissertation because it is only on the extreme margins that a lowly grad student with limited funds and time can hope to contribute something new enough to qualify as original research. My favorite professor from college is writing about some really interesting and at least somewhat topical stuff now, but did his dissertation on "hermeneutics" or some other such word that I can neither spell nor define.   Still, I'm indulging my ivory-tower fantasies for the time being. I'm taking the GRE's at the end of May, and am preparing to apply to the PhD program in political science at Harvard during my 1L year at the law school.   With a some luck and hard work, who knows, I may emerge from school a little older, a little more cynical, a lot more debt-ridden, and a lot less employable. Cheers to me!

       Readings   I'm a Democrat. I'm a liberal. And I've been thinking a lot about the shift in the American electorate to the right. One of the most puzzling questions for many liberals is why, since the economic bubble burst, do so many Americans whose economic interests should and have historically aligned with the Democrats continue to support George Bush and the Republicans in increasing numbers. An examination of both present conditions and the explicit economic philosophy of the GOP, or at the very least one's own bank account, should lead people who've suffered because of corporate scandals, de-regulation, job flight, de-industrialization, and regressive taxes to vote Republicans out of office. Instead, the majority of "Red" Americans (as oppose to "Blue" Americans), a shorthand for those living in states that went GOP in 2000, love Bush and despise Democrats.  There is quite a bit of literature on this phenomenon. The latest addition is Thomas Frank's article in April issue of  urlLink Harper's ,  Lie Down for America: How the Republican party Sows Ruin on the Great Plains . Frank tells the by now familiar stories of low-income Americans in the heartland "converting" to the Republican Party from families with long ties to the Democrats dating back to FDR and the New Deal. Like others, including David Brooks in his  urlLink Atlantic  essay from January, 2001, Frank attributes these conversions to cultural rather than economic causes. Red Americans (alas, to think that that term a generation ago invoked something so completely different...) simply "got sick of being scolded for eating meat or for wearing clothes emblazoned with the State U's Indian mascot." The liberals, they think to themselves, have gone too far. America needs to go back to its roots, and the people to take here there will be the Red Americans from the heartland, where the traditional values or humility, patriotism, courteousness, and diligence still prevail.   Their response, or backlash, to use Frank's word, was to vote for the socially conservative (instead of progressive), unpretentious (instead of critical) Republicans, whose Platonic Ideal is given human form in George W. Bush.  The tragedy of this response, however, is that these same Republicans haven't delivered on the culture war front. What have done over and over again, is roll back all of the economic controls put in place over the last 60 years, causing the wealth gap to widen to a chasm unprecedented "in our lifetimes."   Frank suggests, though does not state outright, that Republicans are merely using the Values talk as a politically potent way to sneak in their economic reforms: "[t]he leaders of the backlash may talk Christ, but they walk corporate." I don't think this is all a whole lot of hot air. I believe the conservatives try and thankfully fail on the major social issues, in large part thanks to the Court (Gratz v. Bollinger, Lawrence v. Texas, the decision reaffirming Roe whose name I can't be bothered to look up), or at least to four laudable Justices and the odd straggler. The result for Red Americans voting their temper and emotions, however, remains the same: "[v]ote to stop abortion; receive rollback in capital-gains taxes. Vote to make country strong again; receive deindustrialization. [and my favorite!] Vote to screw those politically correct college professors; receive electricity deregulation [and blackouts....]" And so on and so on.  At this point in the article, I'm  totally  stoked to find out what Frank thinks is causing so many Americans to continue to vote against their own best interests, because, let's remember, they're getting screwed economically and they're  not  getting to stick it to those latte-drinking, veggie-eating, tree-hugging, fag-loving, baby-killing, Jesus-hating, graduate-degree-earning Blue Americans.  Sadly, what Frank actually writes is a well crafted deconstruction of the "myth" of places like Kansas being somehow "authentically" American. A   deconstruction!!   Well, at least Frank got his Ph.D. at  just  the University of Chicago instead of one of those snobby elite northeastern schools you hear so much about. Fine, so the stereotype of Red Americans as wholesome hard working stiffs is exploded, in part with words like "vituperate," and the French  affaire  instead of scandal. I bet you learn words like that in graduate school.  And then Frank moves on to some anecdotal examples of just how the free market has screwed over Kansasians, and we're still left with same question we started with: why are these people voting against their own interests? No, sorry, we're also left knowing that Kansas is, after all, not the mythological place populated with hearty, honest, hard-working Americans who long for honest presidents like Herbert Hoover, or maybe still think they live under Herbert Hoover. But I think few of us believed that to begin with. Yet, I'm no closer to understanding what is causing the radical shift of this country to the right, and all the article left me feeling is a sense of helplessness and inevitability. Indeed, Frank closes his piece with a sentence alluding to a cosmic mandate for the status quo. "All Kansas asks today is a little help nailing itself to that cross of gold."   So, I feel pretty sucky after reading this article, as I often do actually after reading anything Harper's, or, for that matter, anything in  urlLink Mother Jones , and much of the rest of the liberal intellectual literature. Of course, I agree with most of what these authors stand for in their politics, but it's still really depressing to be constantly told that there is so much injustice in the world, and worse, that its all here today, because the problems run too deep and the good guys are all too weak and marginalized. Racial inequality in education is so bad that aggressive across the board affirmative action at universities for a whole generation is not enough, and may never be enough. Racism in the use of police power is so pervasive that we as a society cannot be tough on crime without unjustly imprisoning African-Americans. Sexism is so harmful in the workplace that the most casual remarks can lead to a multimillion dollar law suit. Poverty is so crushing that healthy people on welfare can't go back to work full time to "earn" their pay checks. And the Holy Grail of Helplessness for the intellectual Left: every time you think you're trying to solve a problem you're really actually acting out of some of sub-conscious motivation which is itself shaped by an all-powerful morally agnostic force like Capitalism.  As much as I believe in criticizing what is wrong with the world, and as much as I believe that the statements above are true, too often I get the feeling that its all a lot of shrill whining. Imagine what someone who disagrees the substantive politics must think of liberals!   I agree with Frank that a lot of people probably get turned off by liberals criticizing their lifestyles and beliefs. But maybe it also has to do with the psychologically empowering message being broadcasted by the conservatives: This is your America and it's just fine thank you very much! The only problem we have is all you hyper-critical self-hating liberals going around saying that the sky is falling down.   So let's all forget about our problems, keep the Chicken Littles out of power, and buy bigger bombs with our dwindling pay checks to and drop them people in other countries. See, now they have more problems than we do.

       News   An interesting  urlLink article  in this morning's Times about language and identity in China and Japan. Apparently in Japan there is a law that list the permitted words that parents can use as children's names, presumably so that you don't get the Japanese equivalents of names like  Final , or  Boat , or  [Father's Name] 2.0  (these are real).   The the article also notes that foreign nationals of Japanese ancestry, upon their return to Japan, receive names in the Japanese alphabet reserved for foreign words. This leaves an indelible mark on the identity of overseas- Japanese that adds to their existing though lessening social ostracism in Japan. The author goes on to contrast this phenomenon with the more accepting character of the Chinese to their overseas brethren.   A few thoughts. I wonder what this comparison says about the strength, stability, and cohesion of identity and culture generally for populations in diaspora. It seems like it could go both ways. One can argue that Chinese culture has a stronger sense of Volk because the bonds that hold individuals together survive geographic and generational distance, so that a fourth generation Chinese-American would still be considered "Chinese" when he goes back to the old country, while a second generation Japanese-Peruvian would instead be considered "from that country over there."  But one can also argue that Chinese identity, because it is so malleable and accepting, becomes vacuous or at least significantly diluted for those who were born and have lived abroad. I think the problem of form over substance is particularly acute for the Chinese, who largely do not have the benefits of a home-grown religion or secular equivalent that would serve as a common tradition and set of practices. This absence also make overseas Chinese more susceptible to religious or secular conversion that would further dilute the substance of Chinese culture. Still, it seems that as long as one of the two conditions, ethnicity and geography, is true, then one is considered Chinese.  The bond of soil and identity in the case of the Japanese is more restrictive. Here is a case where culture (or nation, to use a more old-fashioned word) and state do not merely overlap but also seem to define one another. One can be fully Japanese only if one lives in Japan, and one can fully live in Japan (in the psychological sense) only if one were ethnically Japanese.   At the other end of the extreme is the least restrictive bond between identity and geography for citizens of states that are multicultural born and bred - the U.S. and Canada being examples, as oppose to multicultural states that were cobbled together by history - Belgium and Bosnia Herzegovina (and also China) being examples. In the case of the former, identity is contingent upon  neither  ethnicity nor geography. These cultures are far more vulnerable if removed from the mother country precisely because they are so fluid.   It's easy to overlook this aspect now for two related reasons. First, Anglo-American culture is so ubiquitous that one can pretty much find an outpost of it or elements thereof anywhere in the world. Second, the English-speaking countries, of the New World at least, are still very very attractive places to live. But suppose at some point in the future America and Canada become net emigrant countries, and the dominance of McCulture ebbs. By what will the members of an American diaspora define themselves? Language is one possibility; but at the present rate at which English mutates and spreads throughout the world it will likely soon become an even more bastardized tongue than it already is, making it very difficult for "native" speaks to carve out a strong, discrete identity for themselves based on nuances of language alone.  Political theorists have suggested that liberal civic and political values are sufficient to form the substance of an culture. Jeremy Waldron (25 U. Mich. Law Rev. 757 (1992)) also argues that, in the liberal democracies, there is the advent of a distinct cosmopolitan culture that is more than a shallow overlap of existing cultures and indeed, takes on an identity all to its own.  But cultures by these definitions have serious survivability problems, as they both depend on very fertile sociopolitical environments to exist. (Ironically, Waldron uses his example of the cosmopolitan culture as an argument against state protections of and exemptions for minority cultures, when in fact a cosmopolitan culture is probably the least self-sufficient culture imaginable - try being [to paraphrase Waldron] an English-speaking Aussie who eat Thai food and listens to German opera if everyone around you speaks only Portuguese, has never heard of music with string instruments, and doesn't know what Thai food is.) They require states that are, well, liberal and/or cosmopolitan.   Perhaps the most important function of a culture is to provide meaning and social support for a person, or rather a people of sufficient critical mass, regardless of the external social or political circumstances, provided that they are not overtly and aggressively hostile. It doesn't seem to me that a liberal or cosmopolitan "culture" is able to provide these things under any but the most ideal conditions.   Everyone can feel a little Irish on St. Patrick's Day when there's an enormous parade marching down 5th Avenue a block from one's office. But one would probably have to  be  Irish to get that same feeling on some dusty bomb-ridden road outside Tikrit.

       Impatiently Waiting   I have about 6 weeks left before I leave my job, hopefully. There are bunch of things to do between now and then, not the least of which is finding someone to take over my apartment. Then there is summer, which I'm very excited about. I also spend a lot of time thinking about starting law school in the Fall, and as lame as it is to say, I can't wait to go.  I've heard a lot of different things about law school. Most of the evaluations range from ambivalence  to downright despair, except from those who are already out and practicing; for them law school was an idyllic time, but I guess that reflects more on being a lawyer than on being a law student. Thoughts about the profession also trouble me, but that's a whole different story.  Despite what I've heard though I'm genuinely looking forward to school. Maybe it's the occasional light-hearted anecdote, like when one young associate at the firm told me about "Gunner Bingo" tournaments. She made law school sound much less overwhelming than what I've heard form a lot of places, and her refrain "you go to class, you do the reading, you get a B. It's not heavy lifting" is reassuring. It's also the chance to back on a campus, which offers so many other intellectual and quality of life benefits not found on the outside, very few of them having to do with actual course work, naturally. I want to have time to read again, and to discuss ideas with people who are reading the same things I am. I want to write again, and have topics that interest me and the resources and guidance to help me along. And I want to learn to play squash, and not at a place that has the words "Yale" and "Club" in its name.  But I worry too. There are so many people who are a whole lot sharper than I am, and a bunch of others who are probably reading through their 1L course outlines now while still in college, and who will be asking their friends for old exams during the summer - I bet I could guess who these people are from my school. I worry I won't be competitive for all the thing that law-type people go after, like Law Review and appellate clerkships and so on, and I worry that I'll be complacent and just settle on the grades, on the job. I don't think I'd have trouble putting in the work in school, but for every little bit I do a bunch of other people are surely doing a lot more, especially with a class of more than 500 students.   So I'm trying to prepare as much as I can before school, psychologically, and, for lack of a better term I'll call administratively, a.k.a. getting my shit together, (almost) literally. I figure it's best to go in ready to  start all the academic work and not worry about the adjustment and career-related distractions.    But I am going to remain doggedly ignorant of what is actually taught in law school. I don't want to on the wrong side of Gunner Bingo; I want to win those prizes.

       Readings   Lawrence Lessig has a disenchanting  urlLink essay  this month about his personal experience with Supreme Court advocacy. In it he writes about how the Court completely ignored what seems like pretty solid reasoning, and voted based on entrenched property interests. It's not a whining piece though; Lessig concludes that he should have played up the political aspects of the case rather than harp only on the legal minutiae during oral arguments.   In other news , Ulster County in upstate New York has  urlLink charged  a Unitarian minister for performing gay marriages, alleging that he solemnized marriages without licenses. The major of New Paltz, NY was also charged for doing the same.   It's unclear to me why prosecution is a necessary or even effective deterrent in this case. If a state does not recognize gay marriages, then whether or not the clergy perform ceremonies, whether or not they considered the ceremonies "civil," as the Unitarian minister apparently did in this case. The civil effects of the ceremony are nonexistent, and no one is going to mistakenly think that all of a sudden gay marriages are legal in the State of New York.    Still, the prosecution probably thought that the whole thing would result in a plea bargain guilty plea, followed by a slap on the wrist. The clergy walk away, and blackletter law triumphs. But, as one might expect, both defendants are planning to litigate the case and probably appeal and appeal when they lose at the trial level, resulting in a repeat in New York of the California gay marriage cases from these past few weeks. This strikes me as a needless waste of court resources and a gratuitous salvo in the culture wars - then again that's probably what the prosecutors were trying to do in the first place.  This case also potentially raises some freedom of religion concerns, since the person performing the ceremonies was not a city employee, as was the case in California and in New Paltz, but a minister. I don't think that there is much of a debate here though, since the minister in this particular instance was clearly performing these ceremonies in the capacity of a public official, as an act of civil disobedience. I can understand the state wanting to reign in its own employees for flouting the law, but that it would go out of its way to harass clergymen (Unitarian no less!) evidences some malicious intent behind the act.

       News   David Brooks's  urlLink Op-ed  in today's Times charges the Spanish electorate with appeasing terrorist the world over by voting the Socialists in to power in Sunday's elections. While Brooks concedes the possibility that unrelated domestic factors actually determined the election, he unambiguously believes that the  perception  of the vote will be that of Spaniards capitulating to terrorists exacting retribution for Spain's support of the United States.  All of this seems at first like egocentric American hysteria. The Popular Party is a right-of-center party, which has traditionally not been in power in Spain's post-Franco history. The government had also fallen out of favor with the electorate as early as a year ago, when there were massive protests against Spain's sending troops to Iraq. One can conclude that the Spanish electorate had plenty of other reasons to be pissed-off with the current government, and that its ousting was an overdetermined event.   Moreover, there is the idea particularly on the Left, that the attacks themselves had nothing to do with Spain's relationship with the United States. One increasingly-incredible view is that ETA was, after all, behind the attacks, and that the Al-Qaeda link is some paranoid American conspiracy theory. Another more nuanced position is that various North African Islamist groups have their own long-standing beef with the Spanish government, which though it may haven been aggravated by the Iraq war, was certainly not predicated on it.  Thus, although these groups may be behind the attacks in Madrid, Americans are wrong to lump the people and motives behind them together with those of Al-Qaeda and its sympathizers.  A couple of things give me pause about these latter two views. The evidence coming in suggest strongly against ETA being the culprit in the attacks. So even if the Al-Qaeda link is a conspiracy theory, it is not a merely American conspiracy theory. In fact, a Socialist  urlLink Deputy  says that the voters were angry with the  government  for trying to blame the ETA for the attacks. The same Financial Times article reports that Spanish political analysts are saying that had ETA been responsible for the attacks, then the Popular Party would have easily won the election, as the polls all along showed they would.   The inference to draw from this information is that, rather than being an overdetermined event, the Socialist victory was a direct and proximate result of the terrorist attacks, believed to be perpetrated by groups linked or sympathetic to Al-Qaeda. So, the Spanish people became, overnight, massively more dissatisfied with their government's foreign and security policy, but why? It seems unlikely that the motivation is simply capitulation out of fear. Rather, one can take the position that Spain's involvement in Iraq is a distraction from the broader fight against extremism and terrorism, and so the Socialists' vocal platform against a continued Spanish presence there would be a stronger rather than weaker stance against terrorism.   But Brooks's argument about perception is still a persuasive one. Even if the people who actually attacked Spain couldn't give a monkey about the United States, Iraq, or for the sake of argument, Islam, it is still true that the correlation of events looks very encouraging to future terrorists, even if (or especially if) their interpretation of the events, like Brooks', mine, and the Spanish electorate's, were totally wrong.   One hopes terrorists are more perceptive and sophisticated.

      Since graduating last June I've noticed I haven't really been thinking or writing at all. In the interest of being less-grossly-unprepared for returning to school in the Fall, I'm trying to write down some of my thoughts on interesting articles, ideas and (less often) experiences.

       Do I Really Want to Read 448 Pages on This?   Alan Wolfe writes a  urlLink review  of Sam Huntington's new book    Who Are We?  in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs.  Apparently, Huntington is now worried not so much about civilizations clashing but rather sneaking across the border and threatening the nice little Anglo-Protestant thing we've got going on in this country. Wolfe's summary of the basic argument is that the new waves of immigration, particularly from non-European countries, is threatening the cultural make-up of the United States with alarming sociopolitical implications. Specifically, the cultural traditions that gave birth to and nurished a dynamic republic that values individual rights and democratic procedures, and to a citizenry that is active in the preservation and extension of these rights and procedures, is jeopardized by a growing population that is at best indifferent and at best apathetic and at worst hostile to these traditions. Moreover, the new waves of immigrants are, unlike their counterparts from generations past, increasingly less susceptible to cultural and political assimilation. The end result of this trend is that the citizens of this country will become less and less patriotic, liberal, and democratic.  Huntington's is not a new argument. Wolfe writes that the sentiments (and indeed they are just that, sentiments, not    reasons   or   data  ) are eerily similar to the nativist bellyaching last heard in the Nineteenth Century. Indeed, Huntington writes that nativism will likely return in force if the immigration trend continues, and especially if the economic downturn continues as well. There are two planks of the nativist argument, one more convincing than the other, but both ultimately flawed.  The first argument is unabashedly selfish. Its premises are that (1) a wealthy country's economy can sustain a certain (comfortable) standard of living for only so many people, (2) people who are already in a country have the right to exclude   all  those who are not already there. What is the justification for the second premise? Is it something as simple as "I was here first?" This position sounds intutive, and is in line with the Anglo-Protestant tradition mentioned by Huntington. Bruce Ackerman writes what I think is a well-crafted (and funny) response to this position in his   Social Justice and the Liberal State   (1981). Ackerman's point is that unless we reduce a country to be the   private  property of its first inhabiters, a position I don't think even the staunchest of nativists advocate, there can be no justification for excluding immigrants on the basis of who got there first. If timing were really the only justification, then we'd arrive at the perverse conclusion that the children of citizens are in no more favorable position to be granted citizenship than immigrants, since they arguably "arrive" later than do adult immigrants.  Speaking of which, the last episode of this season's South Park does a very clever take on the whole immigration thing. In the episode, South Park is flooded with "immigrants" from the future. This is not a techno-savy, Star Trekkie future, but rather a poverty-stricken, labor-glutted, modern-day-developing-country resembling future. These immigrants are quite literally the progeny of the current generation of South Park citizens. In the episode, the citizens of South Park protest against the new immigrants from the future driving down wages and taking every one's jobs. (With this comes the catch-phrase "They took ahr jahbs!" inspired surely by the now immortal Cartman "Respect my Ah-thor-eh-Tah!" from the show's early years.") The irony in this episode is that the people of South Park are trying to exclude like foreign immigrants the very same people that navtivists claim to be saving the country for, their own future generations. The characters' ultimate solution to their problem is to try to prevent the future peoples from ever coming into existence. How they try to make this happen is much to profane (and hilarious) to write about here.  The second variant of the nativist argument is more clever is more insidious. It holds that what sets, say, Americans apart from others and what gives current Americans and their children rights to exclude others is not who got here first. Rather, it is the values they hold and the principles they support. The first premise of this argument is that liberal democratic countries are worth preserving and that liberal democratic citizens are preferable to non-liberal, non-democratic citizens for that task. Sounds fine, no argument from me, or from most other liberal I suspect. The second premise is that liberal democracies are dependent on certain values that exist in some but not all cultural traditions, and that these values must be perpetually present in order for the continued existence of liberal democracy. This premise is explicitly opposed to the idea of the Founding Fathers that a virtuous system of government does not need virtuous citizens in order to survive (and the converse that virtuous citizens need not a virtuous system of government). I think most liberals would grant this premise up to a certain point, namely that you'd probably need citizens who were not all overtly and committedtly hostile to ideas like democracy and individual rights. But short of that, people who are not culturally familiar with liberal principles should be fairly easily convinced of liberalism's virtues once they have lived, gone to school, and worked in the United States for some years, and certainly after a generation.  "Ah ha," the Nativist might say, "these new immigrants don't associate with the rest of America. They stay in their own linguistic communities wherein the the important values and principles of Anglo-Protestantism can't penetrate." Part of this is surely true. Now, as before, many immigrants tend to move to little cultural enclaves and live amongst others who share their language, traditions, dress, cuisine and so forth. And this is important and valuable for other peoples as well, for without the critical of distinct cultural communities the broader liberal society would not be able to enjoy the cosmopolitan lifestyle so many claim to cherish.   The phenonmenon of cultural enclaves in the cities and towns of America is certainly not a historical novelty of the late Twentieth Century. Waves of immigrants in the past settled first in the little ethnic neighborhoods in cities like New York, and slowly over the years and generations moved away from the city and into the suburbs (or uptown) where homogeneity is no longer in terms of language or religion but rather by income bracket and motor-vehicle preference.   Moreover, we should consider that all of the previous generations of immigrants assimilated politico-culturally to this country before the availability of the 24-hour news cycle, a dozen cable news stations, and hundreds of Internet sites devoted to civic-ish stuff. The saturation of media in society is at a significantly higher level than it had been at any time in the past, and the invisible walls that separate the enthnic neighborhoods from the broader society are no match for the trumpets of an all-pervasive American Culture.  Without any data beyond some skimpy ones cited by Wolfe on hand, I cannot say that immigrants today are in fact assimilating culturally at a comparable rate as had those in the past. But if in fact Huntington is right, and peoples immigrating to America are less likely to adopt and internalize the important civic virtues that previous generations had, I would submit that perhaps it is not due to some changes in the quantity or quality of those who are seeking a new life here, but rather due to changes in American culture itself.  To list one possible contributing cause, I would observe that media explosion in the last generation has done a great deal to fragment the American identity and American culture. Not only are Americans spending more and more time in front of the television, the video game console, and the computer than they'd ever had in the past, they are also no longer sharing the same experience while doing so. With hundreds of cable channels and scores of websites and newgroups for every possible interest, lifestyle, and viewpoint, each person can now construct a "community" of sorts that suits his pre-existing values, rather than negotiate these values with a geographically defined and confined community. One effect of this phenonmenon might be that individuals become more self-absorbed and less interested in even listening to the other side, since they have always at their fingertips an existing group who agrees with them. The less exchange there is between groups with different values and opinions, the more tenuous the link between citizens who do not share pre-existing agreement on their conceptions of the good life.  Another possible contributing cause may simply be that the quality of the media has reached a new nadir. Every generation no doubt critcizes its own popular culture when comparing it to some nostalgically conceived impression of popular culture that wasn't so crude and inane. But come on! What passes for news now is pure bullocks. The news media sounds so partisan that it reminds me of what I read about the Federalist and Jeffersonian pamphleteers from the early days of the Republic spewing invectives back and forth. On the right there is jingoistic and moralizing hysteria and on the left there is incoherent paranoid whining. Furthermore, whatever "serious" news that do vie for our attention along with the Playstation, TiVO, and NASCAR fall into the categories of fear-mongering or cultural wars. It is no wonder that people new to America do not learn to appreciate the true value of American political culture, since this culture seems to manifest itself in only Great Debates over gay marriage and celebrity criminal trials.   So, maybe it's not that immigrants are no longer receptive to American political values, but rather that they took those values all too well to heart: Myself above all others, to hell with   your  beliefs, and entertainment for all!

       Last Day of Work   Got back from Atlanta last night so I could come in today to wrap things up at work, which amounts to piling a bunch of files into boxes and labeling the boxes... so pretty much like what I've been doing for the past month down South.   It is good to know that things are finishing up in Atlanta right now too; I'd hate to have left in the middle of it since that meant other people would have more to do. I've met some really nice people on this trip (and some not so nice... more on this later), and all in all it was a great way to wrap up my 8-month stint on the job. The dreaded Second Request wasn't so bad after all, at least not for those of us who don't have to   review  these documents; that's gotta be painful.  Another thing I've noticed from this trip in working with other firms is how down-to-earth our lawyers are compared to those from some of the big firms. There was one attorney who was perfectly nice and easy-going, but clearly came from serious money. Granted, the sum of my evidence for this claim is his sailing stories at dinner on Wednesday, but then again these were sailing stories set in Newport, RI and the Manhattan Yacht Club. Hmmm. Then there's the one lawyer from L.A. (figures) who brought her little Chihuahua to Atlanta in his own little monographed bag, and then to   dinner   with her firm. She apparently brings this dog to work with her back at the office too.   There was only one lawyer who was actually unpleasant. I don't want to say which firm, but it rhymes with "Growel & Boring." Maybe she was so nasty because she's Of Counsel and had to come pitch in at a document pull, something that is from what I can tell reserved for first year associates and peons like myself. But that doesn't excuse a generally rude demeanor and comments like "I don't care about paralegals," even in the context of joking with another (in-house) lawyer, and especially when there   is   a paralegal in the same room. To be fair, this little incident is pure hearsay to me, but I trust the source and the attibution to this one particular lawyer does not suprise me.   As for my job in New York, I'm glad to be done to be going back home. Though I know I'm going to have trouble disciplining myself, I'm going to try to spent the vast majority of my free time in May reading, writing, prepping for the GRE's, and excercising. I already have a couple of neat books that I'm aching to start, and a few others I really should finish. There's a strong temptation to go visit all sorts of people in the next month, but I really do want to try to reign in that urge and get some stuff done at home. Ask me how it went when June rolls around.

       Atlanta  I've been in Atlanta for work since last Thurday (with the weekend in between spent in Cambridge), and I should have been writing stuff all along, but have not had time. And it's a shame too, since being in a new environment makes for some good material. But, it's getting kind of late and I'm writing on the hotel's computer, so I'll just make a list of some thought I've had during the week in Powerpointese:  -  If you're ever travelling (-ling?) anywhere on someone else's dollar, stay at W Hotels. They are super-duper nice, if you can get over the whole dance-club/lounge style they've got going on.  - Despite being a fairly large and vibrant metropolis, Atlanta is still oh so very conservative compared to the North. I just noticed that the TV in the break area of the floor we're working on at the client site is always on Fox News. At first I thought people were just too lazy or didn't know how to change the channel; but it's only recently occurred to me that they actually   agree  with the nonsense spewed forth from the mouths of Fox's anchormen.  - NBA basketball is a lot slower in person. For some reason, the television makes the court look really large compared to the players, or it could be that you don't get a sense of how large the players really are on TV, but the court looks puny live. For context, I had really good searts to the Hawks-Sixers game last night, courtesy of the client, and for a meaningless game between two less-than-mediocre teams it was suprisingly competitive towards the end. The game was decided in overtime on the final shot, which was, albeit, a miss.  - There's a whole lot of gender segregation in the law business. And I guess this should come as no surprise to me, and I did notice it when I first started working at the firm I'm with now, but being here with two other much larger firms really highlights this point. Of the ten 12 support staff working on this matter between the three firms I am one of three guys, and the other two are both senior to the majority of the women, who make up the bulk of the peon-workforce, it seems. And I guess this makes sense in a twisted sort of way, since men are invariably more comfortable giving direction to women than to other men (except in a military setting, I suppose...).   - I've also noticed, now that I have some method of comparison, how efficient my firm is compared to some other, not-unprestigious places. They have a lot of expertise we don't, I think, but in terms of personnel, we have so many fewer inefficiencies, in part because we simply have fewer people, but also because we don't seem to have the kind of people who are really shirkers. This is particularly true when it comes to support staff, and I imagine at large firms it's almost always the case that some support workers get hammered with time, and other seem to get away with doing nothing most of the time; but I guess this is true in every kind of office. Somehow, though, the deadwood do things to try to seem useful, like wasting 45 minutes of everyone's time with a meeting spent drawing diagrams and coming up with acronyms for things like "desk" and "credenza" and "rear desk."   - I finished a short monograph on the work of Alistair MacIntyre, which actually helped a lot for my understanding of some of his major ideas. What I'm not so clear on, and on which I think the author did a poor job, was with both the criticism of MacIntyre work and the responses to them. I'd write something here to make this little tidbit at least somewhat useful, but I felt bad about writing comments in the margins of a library book, and so I forgot much of what I thought when I was reading it.  - It's really pretty tough to find good conversation even when one is surrounded by not-unintelligent people. The problem might be that a lot of people are relucant to have discussions that smack of intellecutualism because it comes off as pretentious, or for fear that it offends someone's political or religious or whatever sensibilities. Still, I'm looking forward to going back to school if just to have a forum where people can talk about ideas without worrying about these matters of manners as much.  Will write more stuff tomorrow, unless I go to the baseball game, gotta love the corporate seats.

       Road Trip and Wildlife   I'm en route to North Carolina (again) today, after having driven up to Cambridge from Long Island on Friday and then back down yesterday.   It's really nice to be in warm weather again, and I kept telling myself throughout this past winter that I will move to some warmer climate in the future. But the return of summer has also brought the return of bugs, and I do not react well immunologically to bug bites; specifically, I develop enormous, painful welts from the most ordinary of bites. So, I think I may have to reconsider the benefits of living in colder climates, where Nature in its parasitic glory isn't so prominent.  I'm starting to get a trickle of pictures in from my digital camera, so hopefully I will figure out how to post pictures online. I'm fairly certain that my ISP, Earthlink, has a reasonable amount of FTP storage space that I can use to link from this page.

       "Who Took My Flag?!"   I'm going to a wedding at the end of August; my first wedding ever, and it also happens to be my first lesbian wedding ever. It'll take place in a suburb of Boston, and it's of two middle-aged women who've been together for the past decade. They lived together for some years, although only one partner's name is on the deed of the house, and without marriage the other would not have any survivor's rights. Similarly, neither one can leave their jobs to explore other career opportunities because other cannot include her on a company health insurance plan. These material benefits, plus the psychological though perhaps more important benefits of recognition, will be available to them finally in just a few short weeks. Luckily for them, they are residents of Massachusetts. The countless other same-sex couples who wish to get married in their home state cannot do so, and, thanks to Governor Mitt Romney's decision to dig up an anti-miscegenation law from 1913, cannot do so in Massachusetts either. Never mind that the law's blindingly obvious intent was to enforce the martial Jim Crow laws of the southern states. Apparently this reprise of legislative hideousness doesn't phase the governor one bit.  The thing that surprises me about the zealousness of the opposition to same-sex marriage is exactly the lack of zealousness about   anything else   in most of its members. Were the entirety of the lobby made up of the staunch Christian Right, who are also vocally and politically pro-life, anti-death penalty, anti-divorce, anti-single parenting, anti-sex, and anti-puppies, then this whole thing would make sense. After all, it is understandable that some people have certain fundamental principles, no matter how unpleasant they may be, whose violation they will not tolerate. But the majority of Americans, thankfully, do not fall into this category. Sure, it seems likely that these days the majority of the country, or at least of the voting electorate, are leaning right instead of left. Yet there is a huge gap between people who are sympathetic to the (fruit)basket of conservative policies and those who would bring about political mayhem in all three branches of government, just to prevent ten percent of the population from using a word to describe their romantic relationships. (Polls consistently show that the majority of the country support full legal rights for same-sex civil unions, as long as those unions do not involve the word "marriage").   What on earth makes this issue so important to so many in this country? What interest can heterosexual individuals possibly have in preventing their homosexual countrymen from marrying one another? The only interest that has been articulated, and I hesitate to use that word, is some half-baked notion about how same-sex marriages will erode the idea, and as a result, the practice of the "traditional" family - presumably a husband, a wife, 2.5, 1.8 mistresses, a cat, a dog, and a  mortgage problem. But this argument is so nonsensical and inane that I find it hard to believe that people actually buy it. Yet it's understandable that people continue to spout it. One can hardly think of a more frightful impact than the dissolution of the American Family, and with it the end of procreation, because either everyone will "turn gay," or the children raised by weird non-traditional families will be dangerously antisocial anyway (because, alas, they won't have dad's alcoholic fits and mom's passive-aggressive sabotages from which to learn proper behavior). There is a certain percentage of the country that believes this story. In their minds, they have a real stake in this matter, because if they lose, then, well, the world might as well end. But they can't possibly make up the majority. There is also a large contingent of much more reasonable individuals out there who oppose same-sex marriage, even though they have no interest, so to speak, in that matter.  Why are these people, these slightly right of middle Americans, so opposed to a policy change than hurts no one and helps so many? Ariel made the interesting point that many of these individuals do in fact have a personal stake in preventing same-sex couples from the same kind of recognition afforded to heterosexuals. Were same-sex marriages to be recognized in this country, people quickly see that the world will not end as a result, and that homosexuals are different from heterosexuals in only superficial and politically and morally irrelevant ways. With this dawning realization, the still extant and often crushing stigma attached to being gay will slowly begin to lift. And then guess what happens? A whole lot of fathers, mothers, grandparents, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, cousins, daughters, and, gasp!, sons will begin to come out of the closet. An then won't it be humiliating for all those who now see homosexuality as at best something gross and weak, and at worse a mortal sin. So it is the fear of exposure, and the fear of the resulting embarrassment and ostracism that motivates those who have no other interest in opposing same-sex marriage to take their stance. This motive is much more base than those who motivate the true believers mentioned above. Those people do what they do because they believe it is a matter of right and wrong or life and death. These people are merely afraid of being shamed, in their own eyes and  in the eyes of their social cliques.  At first I thought that the fear motivation didn't make any sense, because it is a self-denying prophecy. If it came to be that same-sex marriages were recognized throughout the country, and homosexuality sheds all of its remaining social handicaps, then there would be nothing left to be embarrassed about even if one's son or mother finally comes out of the closet. In other words, the sequence of events leading to the negative result to happen necessitate the results to become no longer negative. But then it occurred to me that while this process may be true at the level of national popular sentiment, it is not true for each individuals. An interesting thing about major shifts in popular sentiment, especially those concerning taboo issues, is that people rarely think beforehand that they will be part of those who change their minds. As a result, people in the obstinate majority can't ever imagine that they (or people like them) will change their own minds, but they can very well imagine that other people (and isn't the "liberal elite" the ultimate "other" in American cultural politics?) will change their minds and bring about the catastrophic result. Hence the siege mentality, and hence the fervor in their opposition to same-sex marriage.   The couple whose wedding I am attending had for some time now an American flag with the rainbow colors hanging from the front of their house. A few nights ago, some people, kids presumably, stole the flag. It doesn't take a lengthy and rambling argument to explain their behavior. They were simply immature kids - jerks and bullies, who liked to pick on those who are different, and socially less powerful than they are. Maybe I've been thinking too hard about a rational explanation for the rabid and senseless bigotry against same-sex marriage. It could just be the case that the people who thoughtlessly oppose it just get a kick out of being bullies and jerks.   Don't we all want to be young again?

       Back from the Beach   I spent the last few days on the Outer Banks, in North Carolina, a very nice little area a few miles out in the Atlantic, full of summer homes and sand and stuff. I flew down on Monday after my GRE's.  The exam itself went pretty poorly. The test was much harder than any of the practice tests I did on both paper and computer from the GRE's own prep software. The issues essay topic was its usual banal statement; but the argument essay was pretty interesting, a mini-debate about environmental policy. The experimental section was a math section, that was super hard. The scored math section was more reasonable. The verbal was what did me in, the vocab itself wasn't hard in the sense of being words I'd never heard of, but rather just plain difficult in the logic between the words (in the case of analogies) and the specific usages (in the cases of antonyms). I guess this is the way they would ideally give the test, so that people are tested partially on their dictionary-understanding of vocabulary, but mostly on their ability to understand the use the words in their vocabulary, which I didn't do so well.   In any event, the test is over now, and the applications await. I can hope only that my writing scores will be good, because I scored much lower on the verbal than I did on the math, not so good when one is applying to a social science grad program. To be fair, the graduate admissions process bears barely a family resemblance to the undergraduate and law school processes. A high GRE, unlike a high LSAT, would not really help my chances. But I'm not certain that a low GRE won't   hurt   my chances. I should get the writing score in a week or so. Will revisit this subject on the blog at that point.

       This Post is Not Very Professional   "Two professionals in their 20s seek professional M or F roommate in his or her 20s for 3BR share."  I remember seeing a bunch of ads like this when I looked for an apartment last year, and again when I looked to rent my place last month. As a matter a fact, I posted something very similar to that in my own  urlLink Craigslist  ad. It seemed that every other post used the word "professional" to describe either the current inhabitants or the desired additions. But what exactly is a professional?  I always thought that, when used as a noun, professional refers to a person employed in, well, a profession. And it used to be that there were about as many recognized professions as you can count on your hand. There were the doctors, the engineers, the lawyers, the, uh... embalmers, and, well, the contract killers. In order to be a professional, you had to have been traded in these practices, went to some sort of school, and earned some kind of degree. Are teachers professionals? Traditionally I think they have been excluded, but I saw on the local news last night an interview at an elementary school with some woman whose title was "paraprofessional." The implication of this designation is that the teachers themselves are professionals. In any event, teachers are closer to the narrow definition of the term than investment bankers, consultants, and managers. But now it seems that in order to be a professional, you just need to be employed as anything higher up the workplace food chain than a corner spotter for the local crack deal (the crack dealer himself is, of course, a professional). So I guess we should probably call the spotter a paraprofessional.  Another use of the word that kind of strikes me happens in sentences like this one, "Tie your shoes and get rid of that mustard stain on your shirt; you want to look professional." I'm not sure if this is a sufficiency or necessity statement. Does having tied shoes make one a professional? Or does having untied shoes make one not a professional. Obviously what the statement is trying to communicate is the importance of looking like you're serious about whatever business situation your entering, so as not to give the other side the impression that they're dealing with some careless or dirty person. But I don't see why the word professional got impressed into the doing the shorthand work in this instance. What is needed is a word that conveys the meaning of looking like something within the broad range of "impressive" to "passable."   After all, that is how we use it all the time now. "Make this presentation look more professional." (Translation: "Make it prettier, with darker colors and fancy marble-patterned designs.") It's a PowerPoint presentation. You don't need professional training to make or understand powerpoint; and if you had it, you'd probably lose it from making mind-numbing slides anyway. "You should act more professionally at meetings." (Translation: "Don't use non-standard English associated with ethnic minorities. Don't gesticulate like you're pistol-whipping someone. Wear a suit, preferably one without any logos on the lapels.")   I suppose the meaning of the word professional is well-understood enough, even if it is so vague as to approach meaninglessness. Still it kind of bothers me that so many people are encroaching on the word. I'm going to complain to my Member of Parliament, or maybe just write a letter to  urlLink Barbara Wallraff  and she what she says.

       Historical Materialism and the Long Island Rail Road   I don't even know what that title means, but I thought some Marxist jargon would be a good way to start off a post about economic and social injustice - sort of. I took the LIRR home today after picking up my visas from the Chinese consulate in New York (more on this in a bit). There was a little pamphlet on every seat which looks like it's some sort of newsletter from the railroad. On the back there is a little table called "On-Time Monthly Performance," showing the percentage of trains that run on time, defined as arriving within 6 minutes of the scheduled time, for each of the LIRR's 11 commuter lines.  Something about the table was interesting. The Port Washington line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the fairly well-off to very well-off range, ran on time 94.5 percent of the time. The Ronkonkoma line, which carries passengers to and from suburbs that can be categorized in the not-so-well-off range, arrived on time only 87.8 percent of the time. Now, in fairness, the Ronkonkoma line is a much longer line, so there are arguably more stops along the way at which delays could arise. But surely the railroad takes this factor into account when it builds the time table, and add in the buffer minutes accordingly. So I would guess that the delays are above and beyond the already budgeted delay times.   Still, Ronkonkoma is much father to go from New York than Port Washington. So I looked at the performance for the Montaulk line, which runs from Penn Station all the way out to the end of the southern fork of Long Island, much farther east then Ronkonkoma. It also happens that the Hamptons lie along the Montaulk line, so one can imagine the clientele for this service. Surprise, surprise, the Montaulk line arrived on time 94.03 percent of the time.   It seems that working class folks living en route to Ronkonkoma are 7 percent more likely to spend needless time waiting for the train than the upper-middle class folks living en route to Port Washington, or the super wealthy people playing en route to Montaulk. But that's ok, because those people's time are worth less anyway, so they might well spend it sitting in a train, or standing on an open-air platform in the middle of winter.   Now the Communists, for all they did wrong, at least they made the trains run on time. Wait, that's the what the Italians said of the fascists. But if there were trains delays under communism, at least they would be equal for all the people.  Speaking of the train to the Hamptons, the newsletter I found today also has a section about the special "Hampton Reserve" trains that run during the summer. These are special Friday afternoon trains that, apparently, take reservations, and have attendants who "serve[] beverages and snacks during your trip to the Hamptons/Montaulk." I don't know if you've ever taken the LIRR, but I've never had an attendant serve me anything, except the occasional surely attitude (no, I'm kidding; they're all in fact exceptionally nice). But, I suppose if you have to suffer through a train ride to the Hamptons instead of a nice jet or chopper ride, you might as well have people wait on you during the trip.   Maybe if the people on the Ronkonkoma line had people serving them drinks and snacks, they wouldn't mind the extra delays.

       Rubbish in Real Time II  5 more days until the exam, and I want to do at least two more essays. So I'll start the clock on this one at 10:30AM.   Issue Essay: "To truly understand your own culture - no matter how you define it - requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture, one that is distinctly different from your own."   The term culture encompasses a set of values, rituals, and codes of behavior shared by a particular group of people. Within this group, these aspects make up one's entire life experience from birth to death, such that they become routine. Culture includes the language we speak and when and how it is spoken; it includes a set of religious or non-theistic ethical principles that governs our daily lives, and it includes the rules guiding all social interactions. We can practice our culture without being aware that there could be other ways of living our lives, since it could be the only thing we've ever known. Thus, in order for each person to truly understand his own culture, he needs to have personal knowledge of at least one other culture whose rituals, codes, and values are distinctly different from those of his own.  To understand something requires at the very least some knowledge about what that thing is, how it has come to be, and why it is that instead of something else. When applied to culture, understanding requires knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast the basic elements of each. Without knowledge of another culture, we would not even know that ours is, in fact, a culture that is one of a set of many different and distinct cultures. Similarly, if we had no knowledge of other celestial bodies we would not know that the earth is but one of many objects in the universe, and thus not have an understanding of what the earth truly is.   Secondly, knowing another culture allows us to understand the origins of our own culture. Origins in this case does not mean the founding myths of a culture, which surely every one has. Rather, it means the historical conditions which gave rise to the parricular set of ideas, practices, and values that made up this culture instead of another one. For example, an island nation in tropics will likely have developed a different type of culture than a land-locked nation in the desert. In order to understand how one's own culture originated, one has to know about the origins of another culture in order to think about how differing conditions and circumstances impacted the development of each. It is only with this knowledge that culture are shaped by causal factors, and are not simply how things are naturally done, that we can understand our own culture.  Thirdly, and perhaps most important, one needs to know about another culture in order to appreciate what is valuable in his own culture. Without knowledge of how one's own culture could be different and what that experience might be like, one cannot really understand the experience of living in one's own culture. For example, a person growing up in a culture that values individualism and personal expression would not truly know why those two qualities of the culture are valuable, as that person has never experienced living in a culture that supressed or outright rejected those qualities. Knowledge of another culture's values and practices offers a different perspective from which one can learn to appreciate certain aspects of one's own culture. Conversely, knowledge of another culture's practices allows each person to see what might more preferable in that other culture. To reuse the earlier example, someone from an individualistic society might find beneficial the emphasis on social cooperation and mutual assistance in another culture. Knowledge of a different way of living life forms the impetus for us to change what we do not like in our own ways of living.   Lastly, the knowledge one has to have of another culture, unlike the knowledge one might have about other plants, needs to be personal knowledge. Personal knowledge is necessary for two reasons. First, we each experience our own culture in slightly different ways, so that it is crucial that we can compare our own interpretation of our culture with another. Thus the comparison requires personal knowledge. Second, the same observations of a different culture will result in different opinions and understandings in each different person. When we look through a telescope, we all see the same Juipter. Such is not the case when examining another culture. One cannot rely on someone else's knowledge of a different culture in order to compare and contrast, just as one cannot rely on someone's else's experience of one's own culture in order to do the same.  Culture and its component values, rituals, and codes of behavior guide almost every aspect of our lives. Since it is omnipresent in any given cultural group, one needs personal knowledge of another, distinct culture, in order to gain a prospective from which one can begin to understand one's own culture. It is through this knowledge of how life could be lived differently, that one can come to understand what it means to live life that way one does.   Argument Essay  The newsletter to investors contains one main conclusion based on two supporting conclusions. The main conclusion is that investors who own the stock should sell their shares of Old Dairy Industries, and that investors who do not own the stock should not buy it. This advice is based on two conclusions: first, that results of a recent survey reflect an actual trend that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods in favor of lower fat and cholesterol varieties; second, that as a result of this possible shift in behavior, Old Dairy Industries' profits will decline. The author's faulty analysis of the information given and his neglect of possible contradicting information both undermine the main conclusion of the argument.  The cited survey results indicate only what the surveyed consumers said they would do. The author does not indicate the source of the survey nor the selection process of the respondents. It could be the case that the survey was given as part of a medical research process examining patients with heart disease, in which case there would be a strong sample bias against high fat and cholesterol foods, and would not reflect what consumers in general want to do. Moreover, the survey results indicate only what the respondents said they would "desire" to do, not what they actually have begun to do. There is no empirical evidence showing a downturn in the sales of high fat and high cholesterol foods, without which it is premature to believe that consumers will actually behave differently when they are shopping. Given these two analytical flaws, one should not conclude that the survey results are reflective of actual, broad-based consumer behavior.  The author's second supporting conclusion is also problematic. It infers from the questionable conclusion that consumers will buy less high fat and cholesterol foods to conclude that the sales and profits of Old Dairy Industries will "diminish greatly," because that company markets many products that are high in fat and cholesterol. However, before one can soundly make that inference, one needs several other pieces of information, which the author of the newsletter does not provide.  First, it is necessary to know whether or not Old Dairy Industries also markets other, low fat and cholesterol foods. If it does, then there is reason to believe that a shift in consumer behavior will not hurt, and will possibly help, the company's bottom line, since those who stop buying one product from the company will start buying another.   Second, there is no information whatsoever provided on what types of high fat and cholesterol foods the consumers will actually stop buying. Not all high fat and cholesterol foods are created equal. Some, like potato chips and other processed foods, provide no nutritional benefits and can probably be readily replaced in a person's diet. Others, like milk, are essential to many people's diets and will be more difficult to replace even if it contains high far and cholesterol. If the kinds of products that Old Dariy Industries markets are more like the latter kind, then even a general decline in the sales of high fat and cholesterol foods are unlikely to greatly impact this particular company's sales.  The newsletter's advice is that investors should sell and avoid stock in Old Dairy Industries. This advice, however, is given based on unsound conclusions drawn from sketchy data and faulty inferences. One should not conclude from an unnamed survey that the respondents' answer, in the absence of supporting data, will reflect general consumer behavior. Furthermore, one should not conclude that a shift in general consumer purchase patterns away from high far and cholesterol foods will hurt Old Dairy Industries. There is no information on the types of high fat and cholesterol products it makets, nor on what other types of products it markets. Both these factors could allow Old Dairy Industries to protect itself against, if not even profit from, a possible change in consumer purchasing behavior.

       Rubbish in Real Time   The GRE exam as of last year added a new section called "analytical writing," which includes an issues essay and an argument essay. The issues essay reminds me of the SAT II Writing essay component, where the exam makes some cliche and you're suppose to write about that somehow. Like, "The squeaky wheel gets the grease," or "there are too many specialists in society today at the cost of more generalists." The latter was the sample issue given by the GRE people. Since you're allowed to interpret the issue in any way, I thought about writing on how relievers in baseball are becoming too specialized to do one thing, like get some specific player out. But then I realized that was stupid. The argument essay sounds more interesting. That's where the exam presents certain facts and then draws a conclusion from these facts through a series of inferences, some valid, others not so much. We're suppose to write an essay assessing the strength of the argument, and I imagine that in 99.999% of the cases, the test-taker is suppose to attack the argument.   Since the exam is in exactly 7 days, I thought I should start writing some practice essays, even though I always hate doing that. Practice questions, I'll do a ton, but the essays are just so boring to write. So, to make the practice experience a bit more real for myself, I thought I'd write the on the blog, in real time, and post the results without any more editing than I would have at exam time (not that I ever edit any of the stuff that's on here).   So, it is now 1:05PM, I will begin my first essay when it hits 1:07.   Issue Essay: All students should be required to take courses in the sciences, even if they have no interest in science.   The purpose of an education is to impart knowledge on students that they should have, both so that they can function properly in society, and so they can appreciate the value and meaning of their own lives. Often times, this education will include subjects that at first appear esoteric and irrelevant to daily life, especially to younger children. Nonetheless, it is precisely when children are at that earlier age that they are most receptive to new knowledge, even if they do not realize or appreciate that at the time. Therefore, school curricula should focus on teaching what the students what is important regardless of the students professed interest in the topic. One such topic is the body of knowledge about the natural world collectively called the sciences: physics, chemistry, and biology. It is particularly important that students are educated in the sciences during elementary and high school. Once at the college level, students, if they have received a quality science eduationa already, should be allowed to choose their own classes. Although even at that level, there should be broad distributive categories, one of which needs to be science, and within which they need to take one or a few classes.  There are two main ways in which a science education is important and indeed essential for students. The first is in terms of the content they learn through such an education. This content itself can be divided into practical knowledge and aesthetic knowledge. Science is about understanding the world around us, but it can also be in certain cases about manipulating or controlling it. To build a car requires an understanding of physics and the interaction of forces; to invent medicine requires an understanding of human and molecular biology and the interaction of chemicals. All of technology, and the improvement is has on our lives, would be impossible within the basic science that grounds it. Just as science allows us to control our world, it also allows and compels us to protect it. Without an understanding of biology and geology among others, we would not appreciate the importance of preserving the environment around us, or even if we did, we would not know how to protect that environment. Thus, in order to continue to maintain and expand our practical and technological use of science, we should as a society ensure that our students are educated in those sciences.   Beyond its practical uses, the content of scientific knoweldge is also valuable in an aesthetic way. To know how the world works offers us not only the ability to shape it to our uses, but also to marvel at its beauty and elegance. The bulk of scientific research has always been directed at knowledge for its own sake rather than for ways we can exploit it for technological innovation. Students should be taught the sciences so that they can continue in this tradition, and so that they themselves can appreciate the wonders of our earth and of our universe.   The second main way in which a scientic education benefits students is how it shapes our practice of acquiring knowledge. Students in high school and particularly in elementary school are just beginning to learn how we learn things, and what is the proper way to learn things. The scientific method and its focus on evidence and logic impart and enforce lessons on learning itself. Without an education in the sciences, students will not know what it means for a fact to be true, and we risk losing them to superstituions and pseudo-science. Science also teaches students to think for themselves and no simply accept what others tell them as the truth. One of the main requirements of the scientific method is that all experiments be readily replicable, so that people can always go back and test any claim or theory. A science education teaches students how they can themsevles acquire and create knowledge for the rest of their lives.   Once students have graduated from high school with a solid grounding in the sciences, they should have some latitude in choosing their own courses in college. At the college level, most students have some idea of what it is they are interested in studying, and so the cost of extra classes in the sciences is time they do not have for other classes. Moreover, to force students to take many classes in sciences, particularly sciences in which they have no interest, encourages students not to take those classes seriously. However, some flexible distributive requirement should be in place that allows students to choose one science class from a variety. That way, students can take classes on what they want to continue to learn in college.   Argument Essay  The argument made by the author of the newspaper article is threefold: first, that the fitness level of the citizens of Corpora have actually gone down compared to that of tweny years ago; second, that computers are definitively not the cause of that downturn; and third, that the decline in the economy is most likely the cause. However, all three of the authors claims rest on faulty logic and questionable assumptions, and the state of the health of Coropora's citizens is likely much more complex.  First, the author uses the fact that only a quarter of the citizens meet the national advisory board's standard in physical fitness today compared to half of the population twenty years ago, we do not know if the standards used by the national advisory board is the same now as it was then. If in fact the standards have changed, then it is very possible that the citizens are just as fit today as they were tweny years ago, even though more of them no longer measure up to the news standards.  Second, the author draws a questionable inference from the fact the computer ownership level is highest where the fitness level is also highest to eliminate computer use as a possible cause of lower fitness levels. There could be other factors in the lives of those people that make them more fit than others. For example, ownership of computers suggests higher education and possibly higher income than non-ownership. Perhaps some other aspect  of the lifestyles of the segment of the population that has high computer ownership levels affect their fitness level. In that case, the amount of time spent in front of a computer can have direct impacts on one's fitness level., People have computers but not sufficient income will receive the negative effects of usage, and they would not have the means or time to exercise or eat well to counteract those effects.  Regardless of the relationship between computers and fitness, there is no reason to believe, as the author claims, that there is any relationship between the economy and spending on fitness products and services on the one hand, and the level of fitness in the population on the other hand. One's fitness is something that changes slowly over the course of years, and a decrease in spending on equipment or services for one year is unlikely to cause a large percentage of the population to become less healthy. Many types of fitness-related products are long lasting, like a pair of running shoes or a basketball, which are unlikely to be rendered useless by a temporary slump in the economy. Furthermore, the article mentions only that the fitness level this year is low, and not when it became this low. Thus, we do not know if the fitness level of the population changed during the downturn in the economy.  Finally, the author fails to consider several possible long-term changes that could have impacted the overall fitness-level of the population. The comparison is made, after all, between the level from tweny years ago and those from today. Much can change in the population in an entire generation. For example, we do not know if the economy of Corpora has changed dramatically from, say, an agricultural one to an industrial one. Such a change could certainly have a  negative impact on the fitness-level of Corpora's citizens. There could also have been changes in the population density, moving a less dense setting with space for exercise and better air quality to a more dense setting with less space and worse air. Changes in the daily habits of the population beyond computer-use are much more likely to affect that population's fitness level than temporary changes in the economy. If people started eating less healthy food or drove more to work instead of walked, the fitness level would decrease, and neither of these causes has much to do with the recent economic changes.

       Links Are Back   Apparently when I added in the "About Me" feature in the template Blogger got rid of all of my edits, which amounted to all of my links. It seems that most of the hand full of people who look at this site do so in order to get the page to one of the bloggers in my links section - I'll let you guess who runs the most popular site here... - so in the interest of not deterring viewers I've put the links back.

       Book Review   I just finished Donald Antrim's novella,  urlLink Elect Mr. Robinson for a Better World , and I quite liked it. The story is set over the course of a few days in what would seem like an ordinary suburb in some tropical coastal part of the United States. But readers quickly finds out that the town has descended into a Hobbesian chaos of fear and violence, started by what we learn was the ex-mayor's launching of should-held Stinger missiles in the park, which results in the death of several civilians and ultimately in the mayor's drawing and quartering by a fleet of mid-range sedans.   The rest of the story is equally saturated with violence, from neighborhood blood-feuds fought out in a land-mined park to lethal home defense systems surrounding every house. Yet, the mood of all of the characters in the story is probably best described as ordinary. The only problem that seems to bother people is the recent demise of the town school system, which the narrator, Pete Robinson, is trying to salvage in the form of a home school in his own house. Pete, a former history teacher with a fascination with medieval torture devices, oversees a grim disaster on the first day of classes in his new school, near the end of the book.  A very thin but omnipresent veneer of civility covers all the adult characters in the book. Despite the madness going on around them, the citizens of this town seem stuck in suburban bourgeois behavior and interaction modes. Though we are privy to the thoughts of only Pete Robinson, it is likely that the other adults share the same kind inner monologue that, though it does not ignore the reality, mold it into recognizable stories of causes and effects.   The children, on the other hand, adapt much more completely and openly to the new environment of a suburban jungle (and the jungle imagery appears repeatedly in the form of the no-man's-land of a park). An older child and former A-student Ben Weber devolves into Rambo-like warriors living only to avenge the death of his father, killed by the hated Benson clan. And Pete's best response to Ben's state is to invite him to guest teach at the new school on outdoor survival strategies. The younger children were, until the end of the book, sheltered from this reality in their own homes behind the moats and death pits. The irony is that it is with the opening of the brand new school, with all of its promise of teaching kids to make the town more civil (the mantra of the new school was "Diversity, Tolerance!"), is what actually lead the kids to emulate the most horrific act of violence in the entire book.   I'm not sure what this book is commentary on, if it is a commentary on anything. Some reviewers on Amazon.com have expressed with displease that it is merely rehashing the by-now banal point that suburbia sucks. I don't think it's just about the effects of suburban life. The story would have been equally absurd and effective if it had taken place in an urban setting (indeed within a single apartment building). What is interesting is the sub-plot in the story that seems totally extraneous, namely the strange self-hypnosis technique that allow people to live briefly as if they were some kind of animal, an animal each person apparently just find himself to be. Most of the characters in the book are sea creatures; Pete seems to be the exception as a plains Buffalo. That, combined with the setting of the story (near the beach) and the constant physical reminders of the ocean (Pete's wife Meredith's shell necklace) surely have something to do with the social anarchy of the town. I don't know what this connection is. Maybe it's the author drawing a parallel between the return to primitive society in the town and the psychological return to existence as the most primitive organisms on earth, those that lived in the ocean. Who knows.   But regardless of its weirdness and possible depth (or maybe it's in spite of? or because of?), the book is a very comical if macabre read. And quick too, just the way I like 'em.  Speaking of a funny, macabre, and quick read, I would strongly recommend  urlLink Death and the Penguin , by Andrey Kurkov. This book is not so violent at all, and is a very charming and indeed sweet story about friendship... with a penguin, named Misha.

       Funny List    urlLink Harper's Magazine  has a collection of random funny media clippings each month in a section called "Readings." The June issue has a list taken from a post on armywives.com about the things you can do to feel like you were actually deployed on the Front. It is very, very funny, but I couldn't find the original posting on the web site, so I'll  urlLink link  to another blog whose author has taken the time to transcribe most of the list.  My favorite from the list:  "Go to the most crime-infested place you can find, heavily armed, wearing a flak jacket and a Kevlar helmet. Set up shop in a tent in a vacant lot. Announce to the residents that you are there to help them.  The rest of it list are clever but fairly mundane pokes at the various follies of military bureaucracy and at the harsh and often irrational inconveniences of life on the Front. But the one above makes it seem that the person who wrote it has a more fundamental problem with the overall mission in Iraq, and not just with ther operational stupidities of the military. The idea that an armed occupation is good for building civility and self sufficiency seems all the more ludicrous when reduced to the reality of entailing groups of armed men to stare warily at one another. I wonder who posted the list in the first place. Armywives.com itself looks like something cobbled together by, well, army wives. It's mood is, as one may expect, heavily patriotic. But it's good to know there is a healthy amount of dissent in the military caste.

       Let's All Go Out to the Movies   Just got back from seeing "Troy" at the theatre nearest here, which is actually about 10 miles away. Overall I thought it was a good movie, kinda like "Gladiator" in terms of production value and feel; but "Gladiator" had a much stronger cast, I thought. The producers changed a great deal in adapting the screenplay from the  Iliad  , and instead of ending with the burial of Hector, the film ends with the fall of the eponymous city. I never read the Iliad, nor am I that familiar with the Greek stories, but I suspect that there are plenty of allusions that I didn't get throughout the film to works other writers who had chronicled the Trojan War. The one allusion I did get was towards the end, when Paris gives a sword to a teenager named Aeneas who is  escaping the city, and tells him to found a new Troy. So, people who know more than I do about classis will probably get a little more out of the film than I did.  Tonight was also the first time in a very long while that I've been to the movies on the weekend night, and the first time that I've ever done so in a suburban mall. I don't think I've ever seen so many high school students at the movies, or at anything else besides school; it was really quite a sight.   Also, the new template for this blog doesn't seem to be legible on my old PC with a pretty old version of Netscape, and I wonder if this problem happens on other computers. If it does, post a comment about it.     No More Raven Burgers for Me...?   Recent  urlLink research into animal cognition  suggests that some birds may have a more advanced "theory of mind," or knowledge of the existence of other minds, than we'd previously thought. This short Economist story summarizes the findings of two researchs' work on Ravens, including a test of the birds' ability to follow the gaze of a human, and their ability to learn to deceive one another.  I don't think this means that birds are now substantially smarter than we thought they were, and I do recall something from the behaviorist section of my Psych 1 class talking about some B.F. Skinner experiments from the 50's that showed birds learning to deceive each other. Apparently their success confirmed Skinner's theory that all of cognition and seemingly complex social beharior was really just conditioned rule-following, and that even birds can be conditioned to follow scaled-down but recognizable "scripts" of human interaction.  I wished I'd paid more attention in that class.

       Three Pieces of Unrelated News   In general, I don't keep abreast of current events, and shamefully I try hard to keep it that way. News often depresses me. Not the kind of random murder-rape-and-rampage nonsense you get on the local news, but "real" news about national and international political and economic developments. That kind of news depresses me even more, often because reading it just fills me with a sense of helplessness in a willfully unjust world. If you'll excuse the oxymoron, it feels like kind of a secular theodicy.  But, since I spent an hour and half upgrading my weblog last night, or about 75 minutes more than what it would have taken a gifted Rhesus monkey, I figured I'd post about three random tidbits in the news.   Imagine if you could double bill at *this* rate   Plaintiffs' counsel Townsend & Townsend & Crew (San Francisco) is  urlLink seeking   $258m in legal fees from Microsoft for their work in a settlement of a California class action suit against the software company. This proposed figure works out to $3,000 an hour billed for about 6,100 hours spent settling the case. The legal fees would be tacked on to the settlement figure of $1.1 billion. Other firms involved in the case are seeking fees up to $2,000 per hour for lawyers' time, and $1,000 per hour for support staff time.  Microsoft is arguing that these rates are excessive (the stingy bastards!). But plaintiffs' lawyers say that the rate is fair because of all the work that went into settling this case. Yes, I'm sure they worked very hard, and I'm sure every single one of those 6,100 hours was miserable and made every person who had to endure it wish for an early death (or more like for $3,000). And actually, I just browsed over to the firm's web page and clicked on some random lawyers' pages; and there apparently a ton of lawyers at this firm with doctorates - real ones, not J"D"s. So I guess charging five-fold the customary rate per hour is justified because....    (a) these people have more student loans to pay back; 5 times more.  (b) (b)it's necessary to recoup the costs of putting all those extra letters behind people's names on business cards; and they cost 5 times as much.  (c) the cost of living in SF is *really* 5 times as high as everywhere else. Really.  (d) hookers and cocaine to celebrate the settlement; 5 times as many as usual  It'll be interesting to see what the judge rules on this. Actually, I take that back, it won't be in the least interesting. This is why I don't read the news. And this is why people hate lawyers.   The Sun is Going Out?   Strange but apparently true. A  urlLink story  in the Science Times about a trend in the last half century of decreasing sunlight reaching the Earth's surface. Scientists around the world have apparently noticed this phenomenon for some twenty years now, but it's been like the pink elephant in the room until now. Still, the magnitude and longevity of the trend is unclear, according to some people quoted in the article, and there is evidence that as air pollution has decreased in some parts of the world in the last decade, the amount of sun getting through has also increased. So it looks like we're not on our way to a slow nuclear winter, and that reversing our environmentally ruinous behavior does have appreciable impact on the economy.  Speaking of which, I decided to drive 2 blocks earlier today just to drop off some dry cleaning and buy a pack of index cards. But in my defense, the streets around here are practically uncrossable, since no one ever walks outside. The times were I do walk to the strip mall from the subdivision, I'm always the only pedestrian in sight.   Tom Delay   Is an asshole. This isn't really news per se, since it's pretty universally acknowledged. But I was reading something over the  urlLink AP  about a screening of new, even more graphic photos taken in Abu Ghraib prison. Delay was quoted saying that he thought that "some people are overreacting" to the photos, and that "the people who are against the war are using this to their political ends." Interesting, that Mr. Delay would use this opportunity with the media to take a stab at his political opponents, castigation them for their callous use of such horrible material. I'd like to hear some Democrat or sane Republican come back and accuse Delay of being an opportunism, for exploiting the nature of these photos to get back at *his* opponents for *their* use, and so on, back and forth. Kind of like that episode of   Friends   where Joey and Chandler go back and forth pretending to be hurt by the other's joke about Joey missing his audition because of Chandler. It'd be great.  Anyhow, what's interesting to me is the way politicians say things like "so and so is using issue x for political ends," as if that ipso facto discredits that politician's position. In this particular instant, Delay seems to be saying that it's wrong to use an glaring example of the failure of the Administration's overall policy in this war to attack that policy. What is, after all, a political end? I can think of a couple possibilities here. 1. The end is to draw public attention to an issue important to the country. 2. It is to undermine the personalities within the Administration. 3. It is to garner support for some other issue that is important to the politician making the attacks. 4. It is for the personal aggrandizement of that politician.  Option 4 strikes me as unlikely in most cases (except Al Sharpton), and even if it were partially true for most people (I suspect it is) it strikes me as a acceptable price to pay if the platform of that politician is something worth supporting (like Al Sharpton). Option 1 seems like the ideal function of a political opposition in government. Option 2 would be a less than ideal function if those in power were otherwise decent leaders; but in the current situation, there needs to be personal accountability at at least the cabinet level for the magnitude of the mess in Iraq. Plus, when a scandal happens which, when examined in isolation and out of context seems not terribly serious (Watergate), can bring down truly awful executives, it is truly a virtue of the system. Option 3 is one that can and has been important to gather momentum for many important political changes, even though these changes may not be related to the scandal itself. For example, if by highlighting prison abuses, opposition politicians can mobilize public support for, say, closing the wealth gap, that would be totally great.  There is nothing wrong with using something that gets people's attention to draw that attention to important issues. This is how our minds work. When we see something that really sucks, there is a tendency, I think, to get into the mode of thinking "this sucks, this ought to change or at least never happen again." And once we start thinking that way about one thing, we start thinking that way about other, unrelated things, and we shed a general complacency that's been over this country for years, one that this Administration works very hard to keep over it. It is, however, wrong to take undeserved political credit for something, like Bush does in his 9/11 ads about ordinary people's heroic responses. That is "using" an event for "political ends" in the dirty, callous, and self-serving way.

       When Does It Stop?   I read this  urlLink essay  this morning in the Chronicle of Higher Education. It's written by an English (what else!) Professor about the endless competition of privileged students in high school, college, grad school, and finally in academe. The walk-away point is that academics all too often are where they are and do what they do because a deep-seated need for intellectual validation keeps driving them. Of course, many if not most professors simply love their work and the lifestyle that tenure provides. But I would not be surprised if the author's assertion is correct, that many people go on to grad schools, finish their dissertations, publish ceaselessly, and behave like pompous know-it-alls because those are ways to "compensate[] for a perceived shortcoming."  The author of the essay begins with a personal anecdote about competing to get into the best colleges while in high school. My high school class has its first reunion coming up in June, and this article made me think about the competition for college admissions that existed there.  I went to what by most accounts is a pretty good  urlLink high school . It was a laboratory school run by the City University of New York system, and accepted students at three different times, 30 for pre-Kindergarten, 30 more for First Grade, and about 200 in Seventh Grade. The graduating class size is usually somewhere around 200, since there are always some students who leave in ninth grade for another high school. I was one of the junior high kids, and I always believed that we were all part of the "control" group for the experimental teaching methods they employed on the Elementary kids.   Unlike most schools of it caliber, mine did not charge tuition, and wasn't full of kids from the rarefied tiers of New York society. We were a mixed group; there were many children of professional parents, but probably more of teachers, government bureaucrats, and various other members of the petit bourgeoisie. I would also conservatively estimate that 15 to 20 percent of the students were first generation Americans or were themselves immigrants. The atmosphere was a competitive one, but not detrimentally so, not at least from my experience. Students unknowingly peer pressured one another to excel academically, but I've never know of any instances of sabotage or purposeful undermining of one student by another.   Still the atmosphere weighed heavily with academic over achievement, particularly when it came to the college admissions process. Every September the school newspaper publishes the colleges that the previous year's seniors attended, and the number that went to each. Although I don't have the numbers for my class, I remember that they were pretty consistent the with classes before me. Working from memory, I would estimate that a full third of my graduating class went to an Ivy League School, another 12-15 or so went to the other universities that made up the top ten of the U.S. News and World Report's from that year. Add to that another 10-12 that went to Swarthmore, Williams, and Amherst, the liberal-arts-college entente to the Harvard-Yale-Princeton axis. The other half of the class all went to a predictable list of colleges and universities in the top 50 of both categories listed in U.S. News, and less than a handful each year didn't go on to a four year program.   It wasn't until I reached college that these placement numbers became anything but ordinary. The cliche that many students enter Dartmouth as one of the smartest in their high school (possibly in many years) find themselves to be in the middle of the pack didn't at all apply to me. If anything, the cliche was inverted. Still, for three years of college I had little appreciation for the deep impact that high school left on my perception of relative academic accomplishment. To this day, I still tend to think of my going to Dartmouth as grudgingly accepting a silver metal (some days I think it's actually the bronze)  because I couldn't get the gold. But it was hard not to think this way when the chatter in the hallways was always about the HYP schools and how the other five were just the "ghetto ivies," (Brown is for intellectual light-weights, Dartmouth is for alcoholics, Cornell is mixed in with a bunch of state schools, Penn is so not-selective that it might as well be a state school, and Columbia is quasi-respectable only because it's in New York) or how one would have to be a total slacker to "end up" in one of the State University of New York campuses.   It was more of a trophy-hunting attitude than anything else. One friend of mine went to Columbia, but that was ok because he turned down Caltech for quality-of-life reasons, so that partly mitigates his not getting into MIT. The only thing that prevented each of us from applying to thirty-something colleges (like they do at a lot of competitive high schools) was a cap imposed by the guidance counselors at 5 private schools per student.   I think this attitude stayed with me through my law school application process. I applied to 15 law schools in all. I told myself it was so I could hedge my bet, but in actuality it was totally senseless. Even the number of applications itself was decided on for worse than arbitrary reasons: I applied to one "safety" outside of the top 15, and I didn't apply to #15 because it was in Texas, and because 16 isn't as nice a number as 15 (seriously!). In reality, it was very very unlikely that I would even consider going to more than half of the schools on the list. But I did it anyway in part out of fear, but also in part because I felt like each additional Top 15 school that accepted me somehow further proves my merit, just in case one or two acceptances were due to some kind of fluke or clerical error.   Sometimes I think that this kind of hollow competitiveness will end in law school. But now I worry that if anything it will get worse, because there are things like law review, and appellate clerkships, and then who knows, maybe the process will start all over again with graduate school applications and tenure-track job searches on law faculties. And then it never ends; it becomes publishing the most and in the best journals, attending conferences wearing the name of the most respected university in the field on one's name tag (and I hear from reliable sources that professors are particularly snobbish when it comes to those name tags). Once I've gotten used to defining success and failure based on these criteria, it is hard to switch to a different way of thinking about what accomplishments are meaningful in life - sure, *anyone* can have a loving family and be a pillar of the community, but you need a *degree* and $150,000 in student loans to do what I do... and so on and so forth.   And who knows what I'll do. But that's another question for another entry, probably prompted by another introspective rant from another professor on the Chronicle.

       Further Proof That Rupert Murdoch is Evil   I just read a very thoughtful  urlLink essay  from the Columbia Journalism Review by Brent Cunningham,   Across the Great Divide   . The authors writes about how print journalism has, over the past generation, increaingly lost touch with the working class and the poor in America. As the profession itself became more bourgeois, it has also gravitated to culturally and socially elitist views and interests, most notibly in the way it treats poverty as a one-dimensional problem, and how it all buy ignores truly working class Americans.  In telling this story, Cunningham helpfully makes a digression to define the terms "working class," contrasting it to what we normally think of as "middle class" or "capitalist class." Class, according to economist Michael Zweig, ought properly be based on power and control over one's own economic well-being. However, we now tend to think of it as related exclusively to income, or to education, both of which though likely to impact one's class, hardly define it. Using Zweig's definition of class, we find that many more Americans are actually working class, some sixty-two percent of the workforce in fact.   And in fact most working adults do see themselves as working class, and respond as such when given the option in polls. But the national consciousness at the level of those who record (or arguably make) reality - namely, the press - still associates working class with the labor unions of the industrial age. The reality now is that the working class is composed of workers without unions and the benefits of union representation. They are instead powerless service workers with low skill jobs and even lower pay and non-existent benefit packages. It is this group that, according to Cunningham, most desperately needs and had traditionally receieved, the help of the press to publicize their concerns and tell their stories. Yet journalists today focus more on the extremes ends of the bell-curve of class in this country, the capitalist class and the poor (albeit in a problematic way).  Cunningham argues that changes in the profession of journalism, and in the journalists themselves, are largely responsible for this lacuna in the middle. Two related trends beginning in the 1960s are the corportization of the press and the professionalization of its journalists. Fewer and fewer journalists now come from working class backgrounds, and more and more voices in the press are under the control of "corporate behemoths." Cunningham notes that as recently as 1976, the   New York Post   made its "last stab at bottom-up journalism" before being acquired by Rupert Murdoch. Journalists themselves started to become more homogenously members of the professional or capitalist classes, even while they became more "superficially" diverse with the addition of women and racial minorities to the newsrooms.   The last third of the essay focuses on the problems in the way the press covers poverty and those living in it. But what interests me for the moment is why the press, particularly papers that have influence on the professional and capitalist classes, has shyed away from highlighting issues affecting so many working class Americans. What makes me think about this issue is the cover article in last month's  urlLink The Atlantic , an apologia by Howell Raines, the former Executive Editor at the New York   Times  , who was forced out after the Jayson Blair scandal.   One of his goals as the head of the   Times  , writes Raines, was to make the paper's weaker sections stronger so that the paper would appeal to more national readers who fit the demographic profiles of   Times   readers - i.e. the professionals and executives of America. The sections that Raines mentioned as the weakest were Business, Arts & Culture, and the Book Review, among other "soft" sections. "Soft" is, of course, thinly veiled code for sections, like Circuits, Travel, and the recently added Escapes, which appeal to people with plenty of discretionary income. Obviously, there is no reason to believe that strengthening these sections necessarily weakens sections that are relatively more in tune with the interests of the working class, such as the Metro Section. But what is important here is that the motivation behind Raines' moves is not the idea that it is essential for people to know about the best critic think about the latest opera at the Met, but that people   want   to know these things and they are looking elsewhere for that information when they should be looking at the   Times  . Readers are looking to the   Wall Street Journal   for news about the markets, to   New Yorker   for the arts, to the   New York Review of Books   for literature, to   USA Today   for Sports and rubbish about "lifestyle." In other words, what motivated Raines was not a committment to reporting what is important, but rather a concern for the bottom line of the New York Times Company. So much for "All the News That's Fit to Print."   The   Times   isn't really at fault, for it is just following the trend in order to survive as a business. Still, I am bothered by the pandering of the press to the interests of the wealthy. People rely on newspapers, particularly ones like the   Times  , to tell us what is actually important in our society and in the world, which all too often is not the same thing as what we want to know and want to read about. Raines writes in his article that he doesn't want people to pick up a newspaper with the attitude of "I'm going to read this sonofabitch if it kills me!" but that attitude is far preferable to "I'm going to read only things that I want to know and damn everything else!" I think I've written elsewhere on this blog about how media saturation and fragmentation has made it much easier for every one to filter out all information that does not relate to their own interest or confirm their own pre-existing beliefs. It would be sad if the press were no longer to act as the moral compass and motivator of the people with power in this country, but instead succomb to the their solipsistic self-indulgence.

       Slow Day   I just finished reading a few papers from a recent conference at Syracuse University on Citizenship, and will hopefully have something to write about soon(must get brain to work...). One thing right of the bat though, of the three papers I read, one was from a philospher, another from a political theorist, and a the third from a sociologist. While the first two are properly part of the humanities discipline, the last is at least in a name a social "scientist." So, one might expect that the prose of the scientist would be the most clear, jargon-free, and supported by empirical evidence. But what I found was the that philosopher and political theorist's essays were vastly more lucid than that of the sociologist, which was bogged down by jargon; poorly constructed, vague sentences; and hopelessly generalized and trite assertions. Here's a gem from the essay:        More broadly, the destabilizing of national state-centered hierarchies of       legitimate power and allegiances has enabled a multiplication of non-      formalized or only partly formalized political dynamics and actors. These      signal a deterritorializating of citizenship practices and identities, and of      discourses about loyalty and allegiance.  By the way, once I figured out what the hell these senteces mean, I also found that there was no evidence whatsoever to support these, as they turned out to be, rather outlandish statements.  Anyhow, here's a  urlLink story  that really tugs at the hear strings and shows how the little people always get screwed over by the (Swiss) Man. A federal jury recently ruled for Swiss Reinsurance, and against the developer of the World Trade Center, who sued to make the insurance company pay twice for the destruction of the towers because he claims they should be considered separate events. Swiss Re's victory is the latest in a series of law suits against a group of insurance companies that had insured the Trade Center, for a total worth of $3.5 billion. The developer (represented, incidently, by Wachtell) argued that the total should be doubled to $7 billion, but now it seems that he has to settle for the three and a half.   I suppose that one can look beyond the haggling over this monstrous event and think about the intellectual question of how we cognitively separate or conjoin events in our memories and in the stories we pass down through time. What defines the boundaries of one event: is it temporal or spatial? do we look at the consequences or the intent of the agents? But actually, I really just think this whole thing is kind of disgusting. Yes, I understand that life needs to go on and business needs to continue and that insurance exists so we can hedge against unimaginable events and that arriving at an efficient distribution of funds in the insurance settlement is best for the economy and so on and so forth. Still, the dirty part of this business is still bothersome for some reason that I can't fully articulate, especially because it seems that the lawyers involved in this case see it (as they do everything else) as a game between the two opposing counsels. These games involve huge sums of money, and the difference between winning and losing seems to be whether rich people become stinking rich or merely filthy rich - the presumption here is that to be stinking, one probably has to be   so   filthy as to start radiating an odor, but I welcome comments on my usage here.  Speaking of usage, I've never seen so many different ways of  urlLink calling someone stupid . The target, is of course, the president of these united states. But the novelty of this article is that, instead of being a "well-meaning dolt," Bush is actually someone who chose stupidity as a philosophy of life, thus making him far more dangerous (and also much less sympathetic) than the idealistic fool that even his supporters paint him to be.   And the voters still put him ahead in polls... Some day, someone is going to write a political treatise on the virue of the rule of the dumb; it'll be like a Plato's   Republic   for an idiocracy.

       How I Spent My Summer Vacation, Day 1: A Lesson in Statutory Interpretation  Note: I wrote all of the following down on paper last week, but haven't had a chance to post it. My life isn't that exciting, I'm just lazy.  I quit my job at the end of April so that I would have time to read, write, and study for the GRE's. With my job went my health insurance, and I'm not getting on the law school's health plan until August 1. For those in my position, the federal COBRA program is the simplest though most expensive way to continue on my old job's group plan. Essentially, I could opt to stay on that plan for a maximum duration of 18 months, but I would be paying the cost of the premium in its entirety, or some $468.59, or approximately Much More Than I Could Dream of Affording.  Fortunately, or so I'd thought, there is a state mandate in New York called Healthy NY, which provides subsidized health insurance through private HMOs to the working poor. At first I didn't think I'd qualify, since I'm no longer working, but one is also eligible for the program if one has lost one's health insurance for any of a list of acceptable reasons as long as one has worked within the last twelve months. The two reasons that concerned my case were (1) "Loss of Employment," and (2) "Termination or Cancelation of COBRA" coverage. I thought that I would qualify for Healthy NY since I am no longer working, I have, in sense, "lost" my employment. Just to make sure, I called Aetna before quitting and explained my situation to see if I'd qualify. A very nice but obviously clueless man over the phone said that I would be covered. It seemed that I'd won the day.  I called Aetna on Monday to sign up for the program, only to find out that it and every other HMO decided to narrowly interpret "loss of employment" as exluding voluntarily leaving one's job, even though no such condition is specified on the New York State application form for Healthy NY.  This interpretation along with the text strikes me as horribly misleading. Plenty of people leave their jobs all the time for reasons much more compelling than my own, including those who do so in cases of "constructive discharge." It seems to me that if one is not working, for whatever reason, one should be able to buy into a group plan, especially since the program has a proviso stating that one must have had a job within the last twelve months, so people can't just stay on state-subsidized health care forever (because if we ever did that, then the terrorists would have won).   But I'd also read somewhere that the first test of statutory interpretation is to look at the "plain meaning" of the text. Supposing that there is such a thing as plain meaning, I guess that I'm not exactly eligible under the loss of employment criteria, since I didn't so much lose my job as bring it back to the store with a gift receipt. It also makes sense that the text would not make me eligible, since the program seems intended for people who lost their own health insurance through acts not of their own volition, like getting fired or laid off.  The other eligibility criterion that applies to me (sort of) is the Termination/Cancelation of COBRA. Here is where it gets interesting. The only way that COBRA can terminate is if it were to run out after the elapse of the 18-month period. The only way to cancel it is if one does so oneself. This is an interesting point, because now it seems that onecan qualify for Healthy NY even if the qualifying event was something of one's own choosing, namely deciding to cancel one's own COBRA coverage. But if I can choose to end COBRA (for whatever reason, it's too expensive, I don't like my HMO, etc.) and go on Healthy NY, why can't I choose to leave my job and do the same?  I posed this question to the customer service people and a few supervisors at the various HMO's I'd spent all morning calling. Not surprisingly, I didn't get a good answer out of any of them. The best answer was from one supervisor at I think CIGNA, who said that Healthy NY covers people who can't afford their own COBRA coverage. "Ah ha!" I said, so it shouldn't matter   how   it came to be that I am no longer employed, only that I can no longer afford to COBRA myself; and since I can't afford it, I should be eligible, right? Wrong. The criterion states "termination or cancelation," and since I was never on COBRA to begin with, I can't make myself qualify by canceling it. "You can't cancel something you were never on in the first place," the supervisor avered in a triumphant exercise of verbal reasoning.   That's   why she's the supervisor!  And, considering the plain meaning of the text, she's right too. If the qualifying event is the ending of COBRA per se, then I don't qualify, even if the reason I can't end COBRA is that I can't afford to get on it in the first instance. But that doesn't seem to matter before the sovereign power of Plain Meaning. Nor does it matter that the very existence of the cancelation criterion betrays the program's intent to cover those without the means to go on COBRA.  None of this seemed right to me, so I called the Healthy NY telephone line, which, not surprisingly, was unmanned. Next, I tried to call the New York State Insurance Department's complaints and consumer services division. The voice that picked up announced itself to be a test greeting message, and then hung up on me.  After five hours of trying to find a way to cover myself for the summer, I finally settled on an acceptable if more expensive solution: I would COBRA myself for the month of way, with the intent of canceling by June 1, so that I could apply during May to begin Healthy NY starting June 1. Only one more obstacle lied in the way. In order to get Healthy NY for a given month, one needs to apply before the 20th of the preceding month. The problem is that by the time my COBRA for May ends, it'll be too late to apply for Healthy NY for June. I was told by an HMO that my best bet is to explain in writing that my COBRA was ending at the end of May. Along with this letter I should include a letter from my employer stating that I'm no longer with the firm, a W-2 form to prove that I had been working there within the last twelve months, my driver's licence to prove residency in New York (my license expired on Friday, when they most likely received the application, so I think I have much more fun to come with this), 3 dead frogs, and a picture of the Crown Jewels of the House of Windsor (photocopies acceptable). All this, and I'm still not an inch closer to proving that I currently am not working at all. Amazingly, some guy from Empire Blue Cross actually asked me to demonstrate my unemployed status. How am I suppose to prove something negative? That's why   this   guy isn't a supervisor.  I think some people, Republicans come to mind, would use my tale as a caution against state subsidies for affordable private health insurance, pointing to the various bureaucratic hoops and the inevitable growth of government to facilitate this program. Actually, as I learned, there is no one working at Healthy NY, or none answering the phones anyway, so we won't have to worry about bigger government. The reason my experience has been a mess is precisely because we don't have universal health insurance, whether it is state of federally funded. If we'd had that, I wouldn't have to conduct graduate-level research just to find a new provider every time I switch jobs, or worry about taking a job because it has a such-and-such deductible in their plan with only so-and-so many doctors in their HMO network. Nor, for that matter, would I need to worry about textual analysis or speculate on the legislators' intent because I wouldn't need to fill out application forms for temporary coverage.  But no, that would be too complaiced and economically inefficient (and, lest we forget, the terrorists would win). Instead, relatively healthy people like me, who've taken out less from their insurance in their lifetimes than they'd put in in one month, should be spending hours just to figure out the paperwork. The people with actual health problems, they should spend hundreds of hours litigating their claims to get their HMOs along with Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, Medi-dee and Medi-dumb to pay up. As for the people without health insurance altogether because they don't have the JD training to figure out the arcane system, they're probably better off pouring Robitussin over their injuries anyhow.

       Truly One of the Worst Ideas I've Ever Had  I decided a few months back that instead of going to Europe two days early and instead of being with Ariel for those extra two days, I would go back up to school for commencement. This decision is, without a doubt, the single stupidest act of social-time management I have ever made. I knew then, as I know now, that this will most likely be the last time I'll be back on campus for a long time to come; I also know that this is a rare chance to see a professor or two that I otherwise would not have. But it simply wasn't worth the effort, expense, and most importantly opportunity cost to do so. I guess it was false sentimentality that led me to plan it this way all the way back in December. But even as early as February, the last time I was here, I'd began to suspect that I wouldn't enjoy visiting as much as I'd thought I would. Sadly, I suppose, there just isn't a whole lot for me to to come back to, and it took this trip for me to fully awaken to that.   I wish I were somewhere else, right now.

       Biting the Hand That Feeds You  An  urlLink article  this morning about Venetians complaining that tourism is destroying their city. The comments from locals invariably compare the tourists, mostly Germans from my experience, to all forms of barbarians and invaders. But rarely do invaders account for 70% of a city's economy. There are definite downsides to such reliance on tourism, sure, such as the lack of small business services geared towards long-term residents (like a supermarket). Yet given Venice's crumbling infrastructure, it's unlikely that the city would be better off trying to attract another industry as a source of income - the entire place is built on rotting wooden beams. It's unfortunate that a whole city is becoming a museum amusement park, and now the mayor is trying to lure businesses back with the argument "if you have to spend 10 hours a day in front of a computer screen, you might as well do it here."    Incidently...  the ad on the top of the page with the Venice article was from  urlLink Emirates Airlines , the luxury airliner based on Dubai. I don't want to presume that they do most of their business with people in or connected with the oil industry, but it's anybody's guess why else a tiny Gulf country living purely off oil would need with a large luxury commercial fleet. Anyway, the thing that struck me both in the ad and on the company's homepage is that the picture of the flight attendants. They're all of gorgeous, radiantly pale blonde women. Just to be sure, I checked with the  urlLink World Factbook , and there is in fact no large Norwegian diaspora in the United Arab Emirates - although 8% of the population is made of Caucasians and East Asian expats, so maybe all of them work as flight attendants.   Generally, it seems that airlines tend to hire people from their home base countries. With the Emirates this is probably impossible, since first, there might be serious social prohibitions against their own women working, particularly jobs like this, and second, no one who is a citizen of that country needs work a day in his life in service jobs, since the state provides for everyone cradle-to-grave with government oil revenue. So, the airline needs to staff the cabins with women form somewhere, but not their own. The next best option, I guess, is to look who your passengers are likely to be, and then find attendants that look like   them  . This is probably how they arrived at the decision to staff up with Ingrid Bergmanns (or at least present the image of doing so).   Still, it's a bit weird, because the flight attendants all weird a head-dress that I can guess only is somehow related to the UAE, for they're certainly not Western. This suggests that the company isn't out to make their staff look entirely like their customers, and that is still wants to present some sort of Emirate characters for the airline itself. Why then, would you choose the puzzling combination of having a Barbie be the face of your airline, yet dress her up in some sort of traditional national costume? (It's Desert Barbie!) There is, I think, a much more cynical interpretation to this choice, but I'm not going to write about that.

       I Should Be Watching "The Simpsons" Now   But instead I'm at the computer, because every channel has seen it fit to broadcast the funeral procession, though not the funeral itself (that   tomorrow's   pre-empting televised special) of Ronald Reagan.   One has nothing but kind words to say about recently departed, especially for someone so darn amiable. Then again I don't remember there being a state funeral, nor even so much as a collective "aww schucks" when Nixon died ten years ago.  The next time Puetro Rico votes on whether to enter the Union as the fifty-first state, it should be careful; what better way to memorialize a guy...

       Bush Can Torture You   I just read  urlLink this story  on the   Times  , about a Justice Department memorandum from March, arguing that the Administration is not bound by either international treaties banning torture, or by domestic federal law prohibiting it. The memo, commissioned by Rumsfeld (there's a surprise), argued that torture is legal if it is approved by the President in his capacity as commander-in-chief (but not in his capacity as nitwit-in-chief), because he has the authority to wield any technique that would protect national security.   Curiously enough, the lawyers also argue that military personnel would be immune from international and domestic laws against torture if there were acting under superior orders,   "except where the conduct goes so far as to be patently unlawful."   Hang on a minute. That statement seems a bit odd. How can any action appear patently unlawful (or "manifestly illegal," as I think the concept is usually called) to a soldier if all actions authorized by the President is ipso facto legal? The "exception" in this case seems to refer to an empty set of circumstances, since no action will be patently illegal if the order originated from the President, or, more likely, from the Defense Secretary.  Another argument in the memo is that military personnel can torture people if they believe that such actions are necessary to avoid a greater harm. I don't have any idea what the necessity doctrine (if there is in fact such a thing) specifies, but the name itself suggests that it is a dubious justification for torture. The reasoning behind the necessity claim seems to be that, if one can avoid a greater harm   only   by torturing someone, then it is justified to do so. Torture is "necessary" because it is the only (not simply easiest) way to avoid a greater harm. But it seems that there should also be the requirement that the torture must very likely enable the torturers to avoid that greater harm, and that this bar for likelihood be set very high. In other words, the information gathered from torture must be sufficient, when combined with other actions, to allow the state to prevent some harmful action. If there are other factors that make such an effective intervention unlikely, and there is always a myriad of other factors, then torture doesn't seem justifiable because it does not produce the only justifying result, namely the prevention of harm. For example, if by torturing some prisoner, the army can obtain detailed plans for some specific attack, including information that would enable it to stop the attack, then the necessity doctrine would be satisfied. Whether that is sufficient to justify torture is, mind you, a whole separate issue. But I don't believe that the necessity doctrine can even be properly invoked in the vast majority of realistic situations, if ever.  Not surprisingly, State Department lawyers dissented from the views of the DOJ. What is interesting is that lawyers representing the Joint Chiefs of Staff also disagreed with the arguments of the memorandum. Surely this is because the dissenting bodies have their own people at risk if other countries decide to follow the US's lead and start torturing captured Americans based on the authorizations of their respective village idiots. Neither DOJ nor DOD have its own people directly exposed to such dangers, so why should they care if other states start reciprocating? People like Wolfowitz and Feith and Perle and Carbone have the comfort and security of being far far away, both in terms of their persons and their bureaus, from the reality of war and torture. All of this is an academic exercise for them, a matter of assessing which "technique" produces the most effective results.   I imagine that somewhere, right now, a bunch of lawyers are working to oppose to new interpretation of the Administration regarding torture, and are preparing to challenge that in court at the first opportune moment. Hopefully the courts will listen to reason, and this interpretation will be ruled illegal. Otherwise, the Administration might start torturing these lawyers, because, well, it is necessary that they stop their work preventing torture, so that the state can torture other people who might have information, so that it can maybe enhance national security.

       When the Tenure Track REALLY Gets Unbearable   TBS and the creator of "The Bachelor" are producing a  urlLink reality version of Gilligan's Island . The premise seems to be that 7 people who are real life versions of the characters in the original show will be castaways on a desert island, and their task is to try to get off the that island. The show is now casting for a real skipper (preferably fat and quick tempered), a real first mate (preferably stringy and goofy), a real couple of elderly millionaires (preferably WASPy - though let's face it, they'll all be WASPy), a real movie start, a real Kansas Farm girl, and a real professor.  It was unclear what kind of professor the Professor was on the show. I suspect some kind of engineering or physical science. The only thing more ludicrous than building a radio and telephone out of coconuts is the idea that a literary theorist or ancient Chinese art historian is the on doing it. What is neat to me is that the show portrayed a professor as not merely a learned scholar, but also a virtuoso in functional know-how. How alien that image seems now (and probably did then, for all I know about the times). Professors these days are more commonly thought of as recluses who spend time and money studying specialties that are recondite at best, and criminally pointless at worst. I wonder what kind of a professor they'll ultimately cast for the role on this show.   For that matter, what kind of "movie star" would do a show like this, on TBS no less? In order for the person to be credible as Ginger, she has to really be a movie star, but I never really knew what caliber a "star" Ginger was. Presumably one does not need million-dollar contracts or Oscar nominations in order to be called a movie star, but would a dozen lines in some poorly reviewed, limited release B-movie be enough?  Also, the idea of the millionaire husband and wife team seems doomed to fail in the reality series (that is, fail more spectacularly than the rest of the show). The whole gimmick of the Howells in the original series was that here are these two stuffy snobs sent careening out of their element, and we're there to watch the hilarity ensue as they haplessly try to adapt to their new situation. After all, the show wouldn't have been nearly as funny if it'd been about a bunch of sailors marooned on an island. Millionaires per se are not hard to find in this country, and probably not that difficult to cast. But millionaires like the Howells would, I think, be impossible to find for the show, because nobody like that would ever do a show like this, and if they did, then their credibility as the stuffy rich guy is instantly destroyed. It's no fun to watch a millionaire struggle if he is pretty much like everyone else, only with more money.  Anyhow, that was way too much thought spent on this show.

       Some Updates   I spent the last week or so in Durham, North Carolina. On Thursday night I went to a Durham Bulls Triple-A baseball game. The ballpark was quite nice, and from the looks of it pretty new too. We sat right behind homeplate on the first base side, and had a good view of the field and the Durham skyline. The largest building in view beyond the park was the Durham county jail, a structure that was at least tweny stories high and occupied an entire city block. It was, incidently, right across the street from the ballpark. It showed up in all of my pictures from the game.   Now why would someone build a baseball park right across the street from a jail? Or, conversely, why would the city put a huge jail right across the street from what is probably the largest and most attractive civic builing in the entire city?  Also, planning for the summer trip is proceeding apace. I just spent a few moments on the phone with a woman at a hotel in Annecy, France, and realized at all the Hollywood renditions of french accents are completely accurate. Either that, or when French people learn English as a second language they learn with the inflection of Hollywood Franglais. You'd figure that people in the hotel industry, especially one that caters to foreign tourists (as oppose to, say, businesses with French contacts), and she did, though with curious vocabulary gaps, like the english word "thirty." (The french is "trent"? what about french for "first," as in "first of July"...?)  I'm always impressed by people who are verbally multilingual, even if it is for limited busines purposes. I had trouble with foreign language classes in school, particularly with the spoken aspects, because I am always so self conscious of my pronounciation. The dread of sounding foolish makes me not want to speak at all, even if i'm in a group of people whose spoken whathaveyou is equally hideous.

       Someone Who Understands Macroeconomics Please Help Me   The market price for a   hostel   room in the capital of Iceland (I can't spell it right now) is $50 per person per night. In other words, a single room for two people per night in one of these glorified homeless shelters costs about as much as a room at a reasonable hotel in almost any city in the United States. So everything is really expensive in Iceland. That makes sense. Consumable natural resources are pretty scarce, and external trade is very costly. This is all intuitive. What I don't understand is how the people there manage such a high standard of living. It seems that if an entire national economy is grounded on such harsh conditions, then things should be expensive but people should be poor. The alternative is that the people are very productive and make all sorts of stuff that they can export for other products and services that thery can't produce at home. The example I'm thinking of is Japan. Stuff there is exoribtantly expensive, and the people there have very high standards of living. But this makes sense to me because Japan is a insanely productive country. What on earth does Iceland produce them that allows them to afford a high standard of living while still making things so expensive???

       I'm Frightened   I just found out that the law review competition is given in a TWELVE-HUNDRED PAGE packet, incuding a twenty-page essay, and a thirty-page Bluebooking paper, all to be done in seven days.   I've also be doing some catching up on a few law student weblogs to read about their summer jobs, and the whole firm thing doesn't sound particularly appealing. Then again, the idea of a career spent writing crappy law journal essays filled with as many pages of vaucuous citations as pages of insipid analysis for which they support doesn't sound much better. The hours are surely lighter, and the people are probably easier to get along with, but a legal academic's life is not sounding too enjoyable at the moment.  Maybe I should stop thinking and enjoy myself this week. But orientation days draws nearer, and I still can't muster a totally positive outlook.
