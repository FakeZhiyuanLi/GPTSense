       Weird How I get home and lay down and I start getting a panic attack. I can't be still... the bed is very uncomfortable. I'm so tired and my feet are killing me. I do not want to lay down. These 10 hours a day is really getting to me. It was only 2 1/2 months ago that I did this real easy. Soon maybe it will be alright. That attack still has me fluttering. I know what I want. i'm getting nervous at work and fumbling. i got to go. love

       I think that Ablify is a scientific miracle. Compared to what my head used to do...this is great. Almost like there is no other "world". But Sunday was really bad. I thhought I must've forgotten to take the med...boy was it bad. But I took a little more. It was like not being on any medicationexcept for the paranoia. It was bad. Abilify has the least side affects and the best outcome but I have side affects. I vomited some blood andmy stomach still hurts. I know it is probably an ulcer. I haven't seen anything on side effects yet...if ya'll see anything let me know. Side effects to me...these things just seem stronger-- Stomache hurts, sleep less..but it seems to suffice, eyes blur.. I mean really blur up. . panic attacks pretty regular... and really strong..I get real scared..like something isn't at least once every 2 days. BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY THIS DRUG HELPS ME. I feel "REAL" again. I don't feel like a whole other world is beating me&nbsp;down all the time. I don't have to protect everyone I love from the voices. Or the hateful, disgustiong, things they say.    I am so tired.... :) I worked 13 hours today. And closed the store on my first day. And I did it. Always knew I could work and be proud&nbsp;again. Ya'll I won't ask Melvin to help me with money much unless I work.&nbsp;Good night.&nbsp;

      I found some info on Abilify, though I am sure you have already researched it. (I always do, when I get a new drug, and I doubt I am the only one that does!) But in case you haven't seen this one. Sounds pretty darn good.

        That people can't really understand unless they live it.&nbsp; Luckily for them, most people don't. I had a great conversation with a woman in an AOL chatroom tonight about DID. First chatroom I've gone in since...well it's been months at least. But she gave me perspective on it and a few ideas of things to read. I get so frustrated not being 'normal'...well, I wouldn't want to be the boring type of 'normal'...but at least normal enough to handle things like doctor appointments without freaking out. I have to go see the urologist on the 28th and he's gonna do that cystoscopy maybe, if I can be persuaded to allow it. There are some holes that simply should not have cameras inserted inside and that's one of them...I don't know if I'll be able to handle the pain. I know when I had a stent in for a kidney stone a couple years ago and they took it out, they said it would be 'a little uncomfortable'. HAH! It was downright painful and I informed them of that fact LOL.&nbsp; I want them to find out what's going on with my left kidney...I can't stay on Vicodin forever, and I can't handle how much it hurts when I have an attack. But I don't want that cystoscopy!&nbsp; It makes me feel invaded...     I saw Paula and Rebekah (and William) today for about 3 hours. I took them to get some boxes of baby cereal for Rebekah and bought Paula some dresses at Goodwill...she's enormously pregnant for 5 months, baby is due...I think she said December 17. It was an ok day but anything involving her involves me falling apart when I'm at home afterward, and tonight was no exception, but I handled it much better than I usually do, so I'm proud of that at least. Anyway, it's after 3 a.m., gotta try to get SOME sleep tonight.

        I chose this background template for a reason. The black part meant Psychological and the dots reminded me of the chemicals neccessary for the brains funtion. But a few dots are not there. Like a chemical imbalance. Cool Huh? I'm getting ready for my new job. It is 2:28 am amd My Mel just asked me if I was coming back to bed. Ain't he sweet. Funny too. I love him. I had a bad day yesterday. I can't really discuss this stuff with anyone else but the blog, they get scared. What about you Lisa?   &nbsp;

       This morning I woke up with an episode. Even with the medicine as good as it is; it has never stopped the waking problem. I still wake up with an arguement started in my head. It is like there are several people that are in my head arguing. I really am trying to get control of these every morning but then it seems like it makes it louder but,&nbsp; it also doesn't last as long as it use to. I remember when this started a few years ago. I woke up with an long constant fight between about 4 people going off in my brain. I never seem to react to it except that it puts me in a bad mood. This is probably why I can still work. Thank God though. Working makes me feel better.    Somtimes it feels like my brain is trying to prove something awful to me. Like...."HA HA HA There are still things I can do to you...Even with the medicine." At least I only take one pill for this or else I might be absolutely humiliated. HEHEHEHEHE Humiliated and then left feeling like there is no hope. That, dears, is the worst thing I think I have ever know. Like something (or it all) was hopeless.     &nbsp;  My definition of Depression:   A slow, thick pit of tar, that seems drag you down into the rotating whirlpool and no matter how hard you try to hold on to something and pull yourself out...it seems to have you and dragging you intensly back in. And no matter howhard you try to get this tar off you .... it won't wash away.    &nbsp;  Don't ever let yourself get that low. Get help. I managed to get out of it once...it had lasted a long time. Years.

       I am on a medication call "ABILIFY" . It has helped me since the first day. I got used to get real sleepy but I'm used to it now. It was explained to me that the brain has receptors or nerve endings that recieve signals from other nerve endings and if they don't maintain the correct levels of "chemicals" the nerve endings don't receive well. This can cause dillusions or psychotic features. usually your brain make these "chemicals" by itself, but if not then it is chemically imbalanced. Pyschotic features are thing such as "voices" and other things&nbsp;"not really there" and sometimes violent features. I'm not violent, Thank You God. I have&nbsp;Thanked Him all day long today. I am finally going back to living. But I will be on this thing every day. Oh yeah...The ABILIFY helps my brain to maintain it's correct levels. AAAAAWWWWW Modern Science is a miracle to me.&nbsp;

       I was thinking today..not sure if that was a good idea -I am just finding out about me. I argued that the "voices" were ruining my relationships for years. Any relationship I had was being "sabotaged" by these people with nasty attitudes and nasty opinions. Now I have to see it for what it is...It's All Psychological.... the "voices" are turning into my insecurities about my relationships. Anything I said wrong to the kids..the "voices" chant worse things. Things I would never say or do but they are things I am scared of or insecure about.&nbsp; I am worried that I will say something wrong and it hurt them. I said something before and I couldn't remember saying it for the life of me. I still don't remember doing it and that scares me to death. So now I realize what it means and I am finding out who I am in the process. I am a schizoprenic woman, 33 years old really finding herself. Since I have found out about the phrenia, I have found my best friend in the computer. And in my family. I hope that I don't scare off. I am accepting myself, but I am handicapped when it comes to relationships and living.    I also know that I scared someone today while I tried to explain something that I had been going through. It scared her so no more talking about it. I just got my first lesson in how much to say...no other way to describe it to someone who doesn't experience it except to call it "voices". Lesson #1 Learned. I am sorry I scared her...I wasn't trying to.

      For the people around us to deal with our problems than it is for us ourselves. Because they're not actually experiencing it, they have to take what we tell them and blend it with what they've read or seen on TV or heard about, and often, that stuff isn't realistic at all. When I first got with Dee, I told her as much as I knew about everything that was wrong with me in as much detail as I could before she even moved in with me. I guess I was afraid that when she found out about my depression and phobias, etc., that she'd realize it is too much for anyone to handle. The only thing I didn't really tell her about was the DID and that's mainly because I didn't really know what it was or why I acted the way I did. But when I did find out, I told her everything that I found out, and sent her some websites to read...and even then, she knew but didn't really know, because not too long after that we watched the movie "Identity" I believe it was, and she was like...'aren't you glad you just have DID and not multiple personalities?'&nbsp; And I sat there for a minute, then took a deep breath and broke the news to her that it is exactly the same thing, just DID is the newer name for it now.&nbsp; She was pretty shocked but pulled it together fast. :)&nbsp; And it gave me a chance to tell her all the things about the movie that weren't accurate, that were overdramatized. So at least it opened discussion.

       I was told that Schizophrenia was hereditary. I was also told that "drugs and alcohol" isn't the cause of it or a trigger. But "drugs and alcohol" do not help anyone. My experience was that it sometimes made it worse and sometimes made it better. It seems to me that someone is doing these things to me...I smell skunk when there is none. I thought someone sent me the smell. Or maybe that is the way my mind perceives it. Probably the only logical explaination is that the smell would have to be there physically so when I can't see it my mind makes up an explanation. I think that I can hear people that I know and also people that I don't know even when they are not there. I think I must truly miss them alot or that they had a big impact on my life...so that any good advice I get from the "voices" seems to come from the paople I care about and love. One time I got a "voice" telling me in my baby girl's voice that I should trust in God. I was in a "could be a dangerous situation" when I heard it. I do believe in God, Life and Science. Love...ehhhh

       I told melvin my feelings this morning and he says it ain't true. But I believe you are right. He is still learning and realising what is going on.&nbsp; He says that I have been leaving the room when he is in there. I hadn't noticed but I guess I am. He has been study after he gets home every night until he goes to bed. Literally. I think I am trying to let him concentrate. Because I am wiggly all the time. So I must be paranoid. OOPS Emotional, too.

       I got frantic about 4 times today. I get real excited then I feel like I'm panicking about things that aren't there. Then I feel real depressed about it.    &nbsp;  I am feeling real upset right now. When the paranoid stuff starts I get real paranoid about stuff that isn't even true. I don't want to lose Melvin but, if I do I can handle it. I lost my whole family before. So today I should try to show him how much I love him and then maybe it'll work out. This is the most wonderful man of all my life that I have ever known and I love him. Buut things haven't been there best since we found out it was Schizophrenia. I guess while we were dating I should have told him about the "voices" but I didn't. Never thought that I would tell anyone. AT ALL    &nbsp;  We have been together just over a year now.

      For all those who don't know...Schizophrenia is when you "see", "hear", "smell" and "taste" things that aren't really there. My boyfriend poor thing, doesn't know what to think. But, I hope we will pull through.&nbsp; I have apparently had this for 9 years but I didn't think that it was "something". Even though I have had this awhile and there is really nothing new..it has gotten worse over the years. I am paranoid of normal things. The restroom happens to be one of them. I am afraid to shower and use the toilet because I think someone is watching me. Of course I do shower everyday but it is&nbsp;terrorizing to me. I "fight" the terror and just do it anyway. Just go on and live anyway. Don't let anything stop ME from living. It's hard but then there are good days. I forget things for small periods at a time. It feels really scary to me to be the only person who really knows what is not a normal thing for&nbsp;me and see it happening every day.  I looked at the doctor who knew what medicine to give me because he has this skill and knowledge for it, and I wanted him to tell me how this happened. But, I was afraid to ask.&nbsp; HAHAHA &nbsp;

       I had a new episode today... yippee. ( sarcasm totally)  Today after being told to stop taking the meds, and then I decided to just take half and come off easy...I had awaken to a more swollen tongue and a few hours later my left side began to shake.  From my neck down. I almost thought it was a seizure. The Benedryl is not working for the swollen tongue. It may not be an allergy. We will see. and then an hour or so later I had another left side spasm. It is Uncontrollable but suddenly in about 2 minutes it stopped. So I get to talk to my doctor a nice loooong conversation. I am going to research more.....

       I was told to stop the meds..Mel says he wishes I wouldn't. He says I am better with them and almost like I was before. I took a half pill yesterday and today. I feel better. But I bought 2 of Dido's songs and feel a little better...she modes me. Into a "get it done" attitude. Off track right then....I am paranoid, I guess, I woke up with my tongue real bad this morning and it was past time for medications. I don't think that this is an allergic reaction anymore. Half a pill and over 24 hours and it got worse. But the medication is still in my blood stream. I hope I am allergic or that it is definately from the medication. I am worried that it might be brain "motor" problems. For 9 years I never said a word about the voices but this last 2 or 3 years it got real bad. Especially the last year...Oh God. My memory... within seconds I couldn't understand what people where saying in front of me. I shake when I think about it. And cry.Out burst happen daily, I wanna go to the hospital. But I see my doctor Tuesday. Stoppped shaking then. Something is wrong with me. I think that if I read anything about "side affects" I will start getting them. I gotta go and be ready for work. 2 more nights.

      I know exactly how it feels to be frustrated by 'testing' meds to find the right one or right combination. I've been on several since my depression was diagnosed back in 1995.  The first was Zoloft and it was a 'miracle pill' to me at first. I remember the day it 'kicked in'. I was in KMart in Merced before they closed it down, and was just wandering around aimlessly killing time before my group appointment (back when I was going to county Mental Health). Then all of a sudden (and it really was that sudden for me) I looked around and noticed that everything had colors and textures and people were doing things and everything just suddenly became interesting and I could hardly make myself leave K-Mart, until I realized it wasn't just there, it was everywhere. After that things were better as far as the depression, though the other stuff wasn't even touched. But I think, looking back, that the beginning of Zoloft was the last step of the end of whatever was left of my marriage because out of all the possible side effects that it can cause, I only had one....the inability to...well I can't think of the way to word it that I'd be comfortable with, let's just say my libido was completely and utterly gone (they shoulda put me on that at 13 LOL). I took Zoloft until 1999 when we filed for bankruptcy and I had to include Mental Health in the bankruptcy, I owed them about 700 which to us back then was a lot of money. Soooooo then I was without meds until I ended up in the Safehouse, when they put me back on Zoloft because they thought they were dealing with depression (actually it was the DID they were dealing with but it still helped a little bit) then when I got on my own and had to go through CalWorks for welfare, and had to deal with people, I got switched to Paxil because the Zoloft wasn't helping anymore. Paxil was a REAL miracle for me, it made it possible, for a short time at least, for me to deal with people almost in a normal  social way. But it didn't last, we raised it as high as it could go and the pressures were just more than I could deal with. Recently I tried a switch to Wellbutrin because it didn't have that one side effect that I mentioned earlier, and Paxil does....and on Wellbutrin for depression and BuSpar for anxiety I got very very sick and couldn't even walk straight. So we switched the BuSpar for Klonopin and then I wasn't sick, but Wellbutrin didn't help my depression at ALL....so after about 6 months of having a sex drive but being too depressed to care, I'm back to Paxil now, and though it doesn't make it where I can function socially and of course it doesn't help the DID, at least I'm not crying all the time for no reason as much anymore, I feel more stable, and it feels like the right choice. That's my story...condensed, of course. Sometimes it's so frustrating that you feel like giving up....hang in there.

       Well, I knew I would have to test medicines before I found the right one. And now it looks like that is gonna happen. I don't really want to have to take several medicines to deal with my schizophrenia. I only want one miracle pill. My tongue kind of had a mind of it's own...muscle spasms and swelling. Like it wanted to arch back. So I was order off the Abilify and on to Benedryl in case of an allergic reaction. One day off the medicine and I can tell the difference. Maybe the next menicine will be the one. this trial thing is not my bag. And the Abilify had the least amount of side effects. I am frustrated, worried and I don't know if I wanna cry or scream. I know what is gonna. I will be on a med that stops the schizophrenia but I will need to take several drugs to counter act the side affects of the medication. I am almost 33 years old and I am already gonna have a "bag" of several meds to go with me where ever I go. What a life. Ain't it grand. Just to live   urlLink  Bull*#it     free. I'm mad and venting.  Even though these medications are great and scientific breakthroughs...they still are very dangerous. I think that any drug that alters your way of thinking or changes levels of brain chemicals could easily work the other way. A change in patterns... or shall I say chemical changes...to the wrong levels could make you very worse...probably could cause seizures easily. BUT I AM NOT A DOCTOR. So do not abuse your meds. These drugs for psychological "difficulties" are for psychotic tendacies. Something bad could really happen. Take them but be aware of your body and the differences and tell your doctor. I did abuse the drug one time. I took a half a pill more of Abilify before and my voices got meaner and louder and I couldn't bare much. I almost screamed. It literally reminded me that I  have psychotic features. I am getting sleepy now Thank God. This day almost over. Ya'll be good. Love

      I called my Therapist and told her about the "tongue thing". She talked to the nurse and the nurse said to stop taking the meds. Since I didn't take one today....okkkkkk. I will have to tell him though. I will call right now...lunch. I will not tell his name for his "safety" since this is on the net. He is good though ...I feel. I think he has complete faith in his workand in science..which is very important to me. No Abilify till I see the doctor. Next Tuesday for me. Love

       From the article Aunt Linda put on the blog.  I don't see anything about seizures or tongue problems. I know that the medicine is doing it, it is the only thing different in my life. But the article list akathisia. And I have looked on the web and still can't find a definition to it. It started about a week ago, my tongue doesn't want to cooperate. Really weird and uncomfortable. Lisa where is your blog or are you on right now?

      I had to have the ultimate icky female exam test today...the dreaded PAP. I was a few years past due, but it's one of those things you hope your doctor won't remember, LOL. But I'd been bleeding nearly two complete months and we figured it was time. I think I might be headed toward a hysterectomy down the road a ways...can't really say I'd mind much. The danged thing causes me so much pain now. She also tested me for a couple other things that I reeeeeeeeally hope come up negative....she says since nothing's showing up on the scans they've done, that the pain I'm having could be a combination of my fibroids, an infection, and scarring from the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease bout that I had when I was 14. She says that they now say that PID is caused by gonorrhea or Chlamydia...so that even though I was treated and it went away, I could have some scarring or damage from it. I was like noooooooooooo, those are just too icky. So I'll find out when the results come back. I'm getting frustrated. And even though this stuff doesn't seem like it belongs on a psychological blog, trust me, it's having an effect on my moods and emotions today. I'm tired of being in pain. And when I stop and add it all up, I've been on this stuff for a very long time. Luckily I don't seem to be building a tolerance for it, I don't require more and more. But I'd like to be off of it, it makes me very queasy all the time. Anyway, just needed to write it all out. It was kinda funny in a sad way, when she asked if I'd ever had either of those diseases I was like NO! And then I mentioned that I'd had PID, she was like 'well then, you probably did have one of them...so I thought about it for a while and said well, my 'boyfriend' at that time had been a 39 year old ex-convict IV drug user. So anything was possible. Jeeeze the stupid things we do when we're young. But on the other hand, I was also trying to survive. So it wasn't as stupid as it sounds looking back. Anyway............ But at least I'm HIV negative.

       It seems to be more common now, like a bout of tonsils that need taken out. So I wonder what they will be able to do with it in the future. Right now, I am having some trouble talking sometimes... like my tongue don't wanna work. Melvin says the change in me is definately better...but I am worried about the tongue "swelling". I go to the Doctor next week and I will list out the problems. and that the "raped" pain...seems to have went down in amount of times during a week but seems to last longer. I don't know if I am worse or better. Over-all I feel better about myself and inside but some things make me feel real sick. At least I am not screaming at nobody anymore. Meds....Great for the most part. :) I am just now able to send Tina her birthday present. I have also notified my lawyer and asked his advice on the lawsuit. This will tell me if he has the heart to do it. Thanks Aunt Linda for the Article...It is a shame that this is so common now...but they have a lot of "better" medicines. Two kinds of medicines for "psychotic features". Anti-psychotic and psychotic. There is a difference. Love.

      Health - Reuters  urlLink   Study: Flu in Pregnancy Linked to Schizophrenia Mon Aug 2, 4:38 PM ET Add  urlLink Health - Reuters  to My Yahoo! CHICAGO (Reuters) - A bout of the flu during the first half of pregnancy may damage the fetal brain and raises the risk of children developing schizophrenia later in life, researchers said on Monday. Yahoo! Health Have questions about your health?Find answers here.   In a small 64-family sample, researchers found the risk of developing the major mental disorder in adult offspring rose seven-fold if the expectant mother had the flu during the first trimester. If the virus struck between the midpoint of the pregnancy's first trimester and the midpoint of the second, the risk rose three-fold. There was no increased risk if the flu occurred in the second half of the pregnancy. "These findings represent the strongest evidence thus far that prenatal exposure to influenza plays a role in schizophrenia," said the study's lead author, Ezra Susser of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. In previous studies establishing a connection between flu in pregnant mothers and schizophrenia in their children, the link was seen in the second and third trimesters, the study said. Unlike those studies, which used estimates of the peaks of flu outbreaks and mothers' memories, this research examined preserved blood samples taken between 1959 and 1966. The research is part of a larger study of schizophrenia examining prenatal infection, nutrition, chemical exposure, paternal age and other factors. Among the people in the study with schizophrenia, one quarter of their mothers had been exposed to influenza compared to one in 10 of the control subjects. Schizophrenia is a general term referring to psychotic disorders that produce delusional or illogical thinking. Initial signs of the disease typically emerge in people in their teens or 20s. The study suggested factors that could damage the fetal brain including the mother's antibodies crossing the placenta and reacting with the fetus' developing immune system, the presence of genetic material from the strain of influenza, and the mother's elevated body temperature. Over-the-counter flu remedies also might cause central nervous system problems, it said. The study's findings may raise questions about routine vaccinations of women because the antibodies generated could damage a fetus. The study was published in the Archives of General Psychiatry

       Reading about this I have come to the realization that the sound "dimensia" I have is from the receptor's in my brain not recieving the information correctly. When I here sounds... on going sounds (like a motor running, or a constant sound like wind blowing from a rolled down window... constantly, my brain hear's the sound but "recieves" it distorted. Such as... you would understand it as...if I said the word "sixty" and you absolutely thought or heard it as "sexty" then it wasn't heard correctly. With me , I hear the central air kick on and it sounds like my voices get louder and twisted. A car passes by while I walk to work or ride the shuttle and it is awful ...at the moment when the car passes by it sounds like somebody is screaming the dumbest things to me. I have been so out of it...I haven't joked around but one day this week. I worked 70 hours so I guess that is the main reason. That will be one great check. I am turning this thing off for awhile.....Love
