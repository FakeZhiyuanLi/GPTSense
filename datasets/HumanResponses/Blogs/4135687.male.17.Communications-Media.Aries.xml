						    Somthing that so many today are missing is a real drive and goal thier life. You might say this is because the majority of the globe is still missing the   one   and   only   life fulfilling element called--GOD! No doubt, this is the real source of the problem, yet even amongst the Christian community there still remains a large body of individuals who lack a passion for life. I believe this is a very destructive and yes, even an unbiblical predicament for our nation, and especially for the Church. Let's pray for a revitalization of our passion for Christ and his word! Also, would you leave a comment on this post to show you support and participation in this goal for America & the Church?        I would ask that you take a few minutes to read the following article by David Jeremiah. Simply put, its an a very enouraging and motivating take on what i was talking about above. I would HIGHLY recommend this article, it definitely inspired me--and i know it will do the same for you.    CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ARTICLE .   Colossians 3:23-24: "And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ."

						   In 1913, the first direct federal-income-tax was imposed upon your pocketbook by Congress. This motion succeeded only after the much debated 16th Amendment had been ratified and accepted by the states. (An action that is now thought to have been unlawfully executed!) Anyhow, the original income tax was INCREDIBLY low---only a mere, yet principally wrong, ONE-PERCENT! Moreover, this tax was only applicable to incomes in excess of $20,000(1913), which calculates out to a little under $400,000 in 2004, after being adjusted for inflation. Suprising? I thought so.  The Founding Fathers had forseen the possibility of Congress instating taxes for essential purposes, yet they were horrified at the suggestion of a Massachusets Senator who implied that Congress may, at one time, abuse the Constitutonal ability to lay taxes(section 8, clause 1) by levying a direct income tax. Additionally, when that Senator suggested that the aforesaid tax could reach levels as high as 20%, he was flaty refuted by Alexander Hamilton who angrily stated that no elected Congress could possibly be so lacking in fairness, justice and patriotism. Nevertheless, we have seen the Feds pulling up SIXTY-FIVE percent of your annual paycheck! (1970's)  So, what all this really means is this: every year, hundreds of millions of Americans citizens are financially plundered by the very governing body they elected to office. Unless you make over 370 grand a year, your filing 1040's that our Founding Fathers would riot over.  Your welcome. Have a great day. :)
