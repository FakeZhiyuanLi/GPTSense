      Hmm, today was pretty boring.  Brianne and I had to wake up and go volunteer at a carnival for alzheimers, yeah that was from 11-1 and VERY boring. We got free food though so it wasn't all bad!  Tonight me Kelsey and Brianne went to Casey's with Nick...and Shahrom and Landon were there as well! That was pretty fun I guess.We sat there bored for awhile then Kelsey got a little tipsy and she was funny, then poor Landon got sick, but I can see why...I mean that kid mixes some weird shit!! Hello vodka and beer in the same container? In the words of Brianne "WHO DOES THAT!"Yeah, it was sad! Then we got bored so we walked on over to Wallace Marine park.....Where we played on the swings!!! Now that is where the fun began...Casey pushed Bree and Nick pushed me. It was fun. It would have been more fun if Kels and Shahrom would have joined, but NO they were busy!!!Then we decided it was getting late and we should proabably head home...so Nick took me Kels and Bree home, and Casey joined. AND the cones on commericial right before you can turn onto Kuebler, yeah Nick almost hit them straight on...you shouldn't let stoned guys drive.Then Brianne saved us.......THANK GOD!!!! My heart effing stopped I swear. Anyway, we got Kelsey home safely.After that we had to decide which way we wanted to go home...the boring way or over orgasm hill, well obviously we picked orgasm hill! Although we had to Pry Brianned fingers of the steering wheel becasue she was too scared!!!! Then Nick kept going straight when the idiot should have turned, and once again Bree saved us. Nick was driving bad because he was busy freaken tickeling Brianne. And on the way up the hill casey wouldn't fucking stop tickeling us, while he was trying to convince me there was ghost's on the side of the road! Haha with Axes, and they wanted to kill me so I covered my eyes!  Overall the day was probably about a 7, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad at all, the end of the night was prbably the most fun!  Okay well I am really tired so I am going to stop writing now, goodnight everyone...sleep tight!

       My internet finally works again!!! YAY!! I am so happy, I can check myspace now!      Oh wow, I haven't written since I was at Larissa's last... and I don't know where to start so I will start with last night!      Okay, so last night I get a phone call...It's Blake telling me to look out my window. And I look out and Brandon and him are out in Brandon's truck waiting for me! So I went out there and me and Blake fought over who had to sit in the back...so we both just sat in the front...so me and him and Brandon all made our way to TACO BELL where they got some food and i watched over the truck. Then on the way to Callie's Brandon's truck ran out of GAS!!! SO we had to pull over into some scary apartment complex and wait for the wonderful Amy to bring us gas! So as we were waiting we decided to listen to music, not realizing that it was running the battery out. So when Amy delivered the gas we were all ready to go then of course the truck wouldn't start...we had run the battery out! So we had to wait for them to come back and jump start the truck...then we were FINALLY ON OUR WAY!! By this time we had to go get Audre and Kristy...   We waited for them for awhile then we deciced to drive over and get them, and Blake and Kristy jumped into the truck quicker than I did... and Brandon drove off not knowing I was only half way in!!! i tried to pull myself up then I fell backwards and hit my head super hard on the concrete, it was bleeding and I have a big ol' bump...not to mention I was spitting Blood when I got home!!!! My sister was scared I was going to die so she woke me up every 2 hours! But anyway......I have never seen Blake and Brandon laugh that hard in my life, it was pretty funny although I was in a shit load of pain. After that we went to callie's to give her money. Then we were off to take me home, and about 20 minutes had passed since I fell and Blake and Brandon were still freaking laughing, it really wasn't THAT funny. But I'm glad I made them laugh? Oh well good times with those boys I guess...      Today, well today was pretty boring...Until now of course!!! My favoritest AND BESTEST friend is here for the night..................BRIANNEY BANANNY!!!!!!!   Her and I are going to sleep in the tent tonight, like I did last night...that is how I didn't get cought if you were wondering! Oh yes and me and her are going to do some reading tonight as well!!

      It's 12:48 pm. And holy shit it's like Friday the 13th! Creepy. Friday the 13th's are bad day's...Brianne was born on Friday the 13th in January of the year 1989. See what I said about it being a bad day? Last night was so fun! Omg. Sean, Harley, Allen, Shahrom and Landon. They are so funny, and I finally got to see Sean...and I hadn't seen him since Like the 31st of last month. It was very nice to see him...Yes indeed. Landon played the bass for us and it was seriously the most amazing this ever.He is really good at it, and it was really fun to watch him play. We just wish we could have got him to sing!Landon had to leave early so it sucked. Sean and Allen left at 12:30. Sean asked for a kiss good-bye. Yeah it definetly made my night. Murray called to ask me how my fat was. And I let him know it was going great. He said I was the ugliest girl he has ever seen but that I was in luck because that person liked ugly people? Yeah it was very odd and unexpected. Kelsey and Shahrom were so cute last night. Like you have no idea. They made me want to be in love, although I do not believe in love. The camping in the tent thing was also very fun. It gets so hot in there though. But hey the Fabulous 4 don't let heat get to them. Haha...I think we are going to make a new name though. Something more unique. Like the FUCKED UP 4. haha. I wonder what's in store for today. Hmm, I hope I get to see Sean again. I think we are going to do something gay and go downtown. And Then tomorrow is the Hoop Jam for my sister and her team. I don't know if I'm going yet. But I am definetly going to the show at the Reed tomorrow. That should be really good. Anyway I am getting bored of this so I'm out. I hope you all have a wonderful day!!! I love you ALL! Well most of you.
