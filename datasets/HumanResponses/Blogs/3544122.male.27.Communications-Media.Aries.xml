      I don't really have an idea for a good post today so I thought I'd post some quick thoughts on random subjects.  1. My daughter, Isabella, is growing up way too fast. That being said, I love this age (15 months) that she is right now. She's saying a few words now "dite (light)," "uh-oh," "hey" or "hi" and the occasional da-da (which is always music to my ears). She started walking kind of late (in my view at least) but now she's really getting around and getting really brave. She has three more teeth coming in, all on the top (two of which are the front two). Raising her is, in a word,  awesome.  It's also a daunting task for my wife Shannon being the stay-at-home mom. I really appreciate that role a lot more than I used to and I think it's one of the most important things parents can do if they are able. I love my two ladies very much.  2. Iraq is now a sovereign nation now. A note passed to Bush had the words "Let Freedom Reign" scribbled on it. I don't know who wrote that but what a historic day for Iraq and what a perfect sentiment. I'm still nervous about this whole thing and I don't know that things are going to get better overnight. I think, in the long run, this is a crossroads for the Middle East. They have two choices: freedom or terror. I pray they choose the former.  3. On another political note, "Fahrenheit 9/11" is coming to our local theater (we have one 8-screen theater in a town of about 13,000) this weekend. I actually thought about seeing it but I really have no use for propaganda films. Michael Moore says the film is an op-ed piece. That's his opinion and he's free to express it. More power to him I say. He will not, however, be getting one red cent of my money via a trip to the theater or on DVD. That's my protest. I always thought that people who protested "The Passion of the Christ" should've just shut up about it and not payed to see it. That probably would've stopped many others from seeing it because once it became a hit, everybody wanted to see it.  4. I watched "School of Rock" (on loan from Mike Weisensteiner-thanks Mike) this past Saturday. Hilarious movie. Jack Black is a little over the top but in a good way. It made me want to pick up my electric guitar after it was over and rock out a bit. That's the sign of a good music movie to me.  5. We also rented "Welcome To Mooseport," "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour" and Disc 2 of Season 3 of "The Sopranos"  this past weekend. "WTM" gets 2 1/2 stars out of four. Funny but not hilarious. "BCCT" gets the same. Maybe I was just too tired but Larry the Cable Guy is funny for about 2 seconds before I lose patience. Jeff Foxworthy is always funny to me. The other two guys, ... eh, whatever. Episodes 5-7 of Season 3 of "The Sopranos" were excellent. (I don't get HBO so I'm renting the seasons on DVD a bit at a time). However, one episode that prominently featured the Bada Bing club and its goings-on disturbed me a bit. Shannon doesn't like the fact that I like this show or mob movies in general. After seeing that episode, I can see why. Still, the writers never glamorize the lives of these people. They show them as they are, warts and all. I still think Tony will die in the last season. You reap what you sow.  6. I got a big picture of Christopher Walken to put in my basement. Shannon thinks it's creepy, I think it's awesome. ;-)  It's a lovely day in southern Indiana and I hope it is wherever you are.

       urlLink    Are you ready to rock? ;-)  On my walks to and from work today, I heard many songs on the old iPod. However, one in particular made me start thinking. Don't laugh, but it was Steelheart's "I'll Never Let You Go." How many of you even remember that song? It's the one hit from those guys. The singer belts out those super high notes in various points throughout the song.   "Angel Eyes, you have angel eyes/Such a smile that lights up my life ...  I'll never let you go/You're always on my mind/You're the only one for me/You're all I see/And I'll never, never let you go."   Anyhow, I got to thinking that of all those 80s hair metal bands, they  all  had their one power ballad it seemed. It was a guaranteed hit because the public ate them up. I goof around on my guitar and have shown some folks my 80s power ballad medley. Every Rose/Heaven/Don't Know what You Got/I Remember You, etc., etc. They all sounded the same but they were all monster hits back in the day. Now, I know you're thinking that the power ballad died when "Smells Like Teen Spirit" hit the airwaves with a vengeance in 1991. You would be oh so wrong my friend. The power ballad only went into hiding for a brief few years. Check out some of the songs I've noticed that were hits in the last few years. These are  all  power ballads. Maybe they don't have the glass-breaking notes of the 80s songs, but they all fit the standard format: begin soft-big chorus-soft again-big chorus again-possible inclusion of a guitar solo and/or string section-big chorus.  "Here Without You" - 3 Doors Down "The Reason" - Hoobastank "Like A Stone" - Audioslave "I Am The Highway" - Audioslave "Hero" - Chad Kroeger & Josey Scott (Spiderman soundtrack) Creed had a whole mess of them ("With Arms Wide Open," "My Sacrifice," "My Own Prison," "One Last Breath") Evanescence - "My Immortal" (at least the radio version was) Fuel - "Hemorrhage (In My Hands)," "Innocent" Lenny Kravitz - "Again" Switchfoot - "Dare You to Move" Seether Featuring Amy Lee - "Broken"   These are just some examples. All of the above were hits in the very recent past or are hits now. In fact, many of today's praise & worship songs for churches are nothing more than power ballads with "Christian" lyrics.   I guess the more things change, the more they stay them same. Just a piece of advice to all the bands out there; if you need a hit, you can't go wrong with a good, solid power ballad. :-)

       urlLink    Satchmo   This is the first post in a (hopefully) regular series of posts on a musical moment I noticed during the day.   Today, after lunch at home, I walked out the door for my walk back to work. As always when I walk, my iPod was right there with me. I stepped out the door and "What A Wonderful World" just happened to start right at that moment.     "I see trees of green/Red roses too/I watch them bloom/For me and you/And I think to myself/What a wonderful world."   At that moment the sky was a radiant blue and to my right, roses were indeed in full bloom in a neighbor's front yard.   Sappy, sure but the mood was right and the world was right as Louis Armstrong sang one of my 'funeral songs' (a song I want played at my funeral) in that gravelly voice that fits the song so well. Absolutely classic.

      Here are some things I'm thankful for today. (In no particular order)  1.) God's grace and faithfulness to me even though I'm not always faithful to Him. 2.) A sunny day in the mid-70s. Another great day to walk to work. Not too hot, not too cold. 3.) Music. My iPod has over 4500 songs on it and I'm in the midst of a 700 song playlist (I'm in the mid-500s) for my walks to work. "Last Goodbye" by Jeff Buckley has been the musical highlight of the day so far. 4.) My family. I got to see my mom, dad, sister and her future husband yesterday. It was a grueling day (5 hours total for a 2-hour mealtime together) but it was worth it. Also, my daughter and my wife are two of the most beautiful creatures God ever made (others may disagree with this but this is  my  blog isn't it?).  ;-) 5.) My job. I may complain about the pay quite a bit but I really couldn't ask for a better job. I kind of fell into designing but I can see how I've been heading toward it for a big portion of my life. I may not get rich,  OK, I  won't  get rich doing this, but the hours are great and I get to be creative every day and hold a product in my hand daily where i can say, 'this is what I did today.'  What are a few things that  you  thankful for right now.

       urlLink      I've currently got the above book checked out from the library. I've heard David Sedaris on NPR's "This American Life" before. I can't say that I agree with his lifestyle choice (he's gay, just for the record) but his musings on life growing up in North Carolina is a riot. The funniest chapter so far is about his brother. In the midst of a family of refined former New Yorkers stuck in (what they think is) Hick-ville, North Carolina, Sedaris' brother is woefully out of place. He is born and raised in Carolina and is Southern to the bone. He calls himself "The Rooster." It's definitely not a book for the faint of heart (again, the lifestyle choice and language are the main pitfalls) but I think it's pretty funny and it makes want to read more by Sedaris. I believe he has three or four more books of essays out there.  So, what book(s) are you reading these days?

I pray this is over sooner rather than later.

      Our church, the  urlLink Christian Church of Jasper,  is in the full Vacation Bible School mode this week. This is only my second year of being involved here after  many  years of attending as a kid myself at Fairview Baptist Church in Paris, TN. A few things are different but mostly, VBS is a pretty constant thing at most churches. This year, I am leading the music (just me and my guitar) with all the kids at the beginning and ending of each night of VBS. Here are a few things I have learned in my stay:  — It's  much  more nerve-racking getting in front of kids to play than adults. The kids don't get my lame, subtle jokes (because, well, they are lame I guess). Lesson learned. Try to think like a kid, not an adult.  — Kids love the action songs. "Father Abraham" is probably the best song ever written in their opinion. For this week, it's my favorite too. If it gets them moving, I'm all for it. It's kind of hard to do arm motions and whatnot while playing the guitar but that perfectly alright with me because I could never do motions without feeling self-conscious. That's why it's best for me just to  play  "Lord, I Lift Your Name On High" and not do the arm motions.  — Kids have great "fake" detectors. they can sense pretty quick when you are really interested in them and when someone is just putting on a show for them.  So, after much apprehension, this week has begun well. I'll be pretty tired by Thursday night but, in the long run, it'll be worth it.

      Recently, our church,  urlLink the Christian Church of Jasper,   wrapped up its  urlLink 40 Days of Purpose.  I'm not big on trends within modern-day Christianity and I initially brushed off Rick Warren's  "The Purpose-Driven Life" as just another fad like Jabez or the prosperity gospel folks. However, when we started talking about doing the 40 Days campaign, I decided to give it a fair shot. I had checked out "The Purpose-Driven Life" from my local library and skimmed through a few chapters and realized that maybe there was a bit more to this than just the latest trend we Christians get so often caught up in.  Here are some things I learned through each one of the purposes. Not all of the things I learned were new, in fact, I have heard all of it before. However, this hit home with me at this stage in my life.  1. Worship: Planned For God's Pleasure - Worship isn't just a service on Sunday morning, it is our whole lives. Me sitting here typing this out should be pleasing to God. This is a difficult thing for many to understand, I believe, because Americans tend to segregate their lives into segments (i.e. this is my work life, I'll go home to my home life, Sunday will be my spiritual life, etc.). Am I making God smile with my actions? Can others see Him in my life?  2. Fellowship: Part Of God's Family - Our spiritual family is to be as close, if not closer, than blood family. I was always a little uneasy with this idea because it smelled of cult-ism to me. I have found the opposite to be true since we moved to Jasper almost 4 years ago. If it had not been for our church family, there's no way we'd be here now and that would've been a shame because God has really blessed us here.  3. Discipleship: To Be Like Christ - Work like you're working for Jesus, count it joy when your face trials ("hello friend" -  a few of you will get that one), seek to be like Christ in your everyday walk. Not much new here but a very solid reenforcement for me. The chapter on defeating temptation blew my mind. I had always though that to overcome temptation, you had to supress the thoughts which led to the tempting. Warren says to defeat temptation, you simply 'change the channel in your mind.' 'Supressing it will cause you to dwell on it more which makes it twice as hard to defeat it.' I had never honestly thought about it that way before.  4. Ministry: Being A Worker For God - God has called us to be more than pew-sitters. He gave us abilities and gifts to use for His sake (insert dc talk's "Time Is" song here: "and just as He's given, He can surely take.") :-)  5. Mission: Evangelism - This one convicted me. I often shrink from conversations about God at work. In the weeks we focused on evangelism, I became very aware of how God was bringing people to me and that I should be talking about things that were of Him instead of avoiding the topic. How many people will go into eternity without Christ because I didn't want them to think I was 'weird?'  All in all, I think the 40 Days of Purpose was well worth everything we put into it as a church. I know Warren has his critics and I won't attempt to answer all criticism here (I have some of my own - nothing major though). It helped solidify in me that I am here for a reason and that reason is not to have the life I want, but to do what HE wants me to do with what He has given me.

       urlLink      What I'm currently listening to: 1. My iPod mix. A bit of everything and everything in between. 2. Third Day: "Wire" The band is getting back to their more rocking sound on this album. It's not my favorite 3D album but it's still pretty good and worth the $10 I spent on it. 3. Jars of Clay: "Who We Are Instead" If you had asked me 7 years ago if I would be listening to Jars of Clay today, I might have spit on you. However, I am older now and the lyrical content of this album is pretty awesome. Musically, I like it. It's dark and kind of mellow and haunting. Cool stuff. 4. Hanson: "Underneath" I hear you laughing out there. These guys never got a fair shake. If you like solid pop/rock songs, you'll like this. "Penny & Me" should be a smash radio single if anything by matchbox twenty is a hit. It won't be though and that's really too bad.  What are  you  listening to these days?  Bonus points to anyone who guesses the name of the song the post's title comes from. (Song and artist). You Thinklings can't play on this one. It's far too easy for you all.

As far as I know, blogspot (who hosts this site) wants this to be done. You can always post as "Anonymous" and leave your name at the end of your comment. Please don't avoid the site because of this. That would make me very sad :-( 2. Hopefully, soon, I can make a little sidebar with some of my favorite links. For now, here are some of my favorite sites:  urlLink Christian Church of Jasper  This is the church where I am a member and part of the worship team.  urlLink The Thinklings Weblog  This is where I got my blogging start. They are great guys so please check that site out.  urlLink Mysterium Tremendum  This is Thinkling Jared's solo blog. Jared is the only Thinkling I have ever met personally. He and I had several religion classes together at Middle Tennessee State University. Jared is a great guy so check his site out too.  urlLink Thunderstruck  "A Truckstop for the soul." This is a site that collects articles from across the Web that (sometimes) relate to Christians making an impact in the culture.  Thanks again for visiting.

      Today didn't start out so good for me. Isabella woke up about an hour and a half earlier than usual so that meant Shannon couldn't get everything done as fast as she usually can because she needed to tend to Isabella. I wrote my tithe check out this morning and got depressed looking at what was left (not a good attitude, I know). I went out to the car to get to band practice before church this morning and the battery was dead. Great.  Just great.   I thought about ripping up that tithe check so that we would have the cash to buy a new battery. Then I said to God, 'I will be faithful and give this money back to you even though I (humanly) can't see how we're gonna do this.' So, we gave our tithe and offering check.  After church, a very dear friend of ours gave Shannon some folded up money. Shannon tried to refuse but our friend was hearing none of it. The new battery cost us almost exactly what she had given us. Some may scoff, but I say God works through faithful people to aid people like us. He humbled me. For that, the provision and our friend, I am  so very  thankful.

      Ronald Reagan died today. He was the first president I remember. In fact, I had a Reagan/Bush bumper sticker on my BMX in the '84 campaign. I'm guessing my dad gave it to me. Reagan, I believe, had a sense of what was right and what was wrong and he stuck to it. Much like W. Bush today, he took a lot of flak for his black & white view of things. For that, I respect him. RIP Mr. Reagan. God Bless you Nancy for your dedication to him through a very slow and painful goodbye.

      My church, the  urlLink Christian Church of Jasper  in Jasper, IN is about to wrap up our 40 Days of Purpose campaign. I found this on  urlLink Christianity Today's Web site  a few weeks back and thought it was pretty funny.  Top 10 Signs 40 Days of Purpose is almost over 10. You can't wait for the sequel, 40 Days of Vacation. 9. You've heard Song of Solomon is being re-released as The Purpose-Driven Sex Life. 8. Your congregation talks about "Pastor Rick" as if he were on staff.  7. You're convinced you'll find your S.H.A.P.E. at the gym. 6. You were planned for God's pleasure. Your spouse was planned for God's pleasure. You just wonder when your pleasure gets addressed. 5. You've bought seven Bible translations quoted in the book and you're looking for more. 4. You're still on Day 11. 3. You've begun writing the next mega-hit, The Purpose Driven Vente No Whip Caramel Machiatto. 2. Your ushers are wearing flowered shirts. 1. You'll be glad you can get back to having no idea what your purpose is—and just watch TV. -Submitted by John Talbert, San Jose, California

      A bit about me & my blog: I might be inconsistent about blogging. I may not ever take this very far. The name Alien Soil is my take on my time on planet earth. I am married with one child. I am a Christian. I am an IMPERFECT person. I am a page designer at a small newspaper. I love my job. Jesus and mama always loved me. :-) (Anyone know the song reference there? - Bonus points if you get it right.) Stay tuned...

      I'll have a busy weekend so here are some links to entertain, inform and generally keep you occupied this weekend.   urlLink Get Religion  has a plethora of topics for those of you interested in the coverage of religion in the media. Here are a few:   urlLink With God, and the Times, on his side (Creeping Fundamentalism XI)   Kristof lashed out at the pop theology of the "Left Behind" novels and, to get specific about it, offer his opinion that its vision of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ was bloody dangerous to the world as the New York Times understands it.    urlLink Nearing end of the road: Christian p()rn, Passion and a digital mystery   Anyone with the nerve to create XXXChurch.com is going to get attention, especially if they keep calling it "the No. 1 Christian P()rn Site."    Speaking of  urlLink xxxchurch.com,  I added a link to their accountability software in my links sidebar to your right. These guys shock a lot of folks but I think they are doing God's work for men (and some women even).  As always, check out  urlLink The Thinklings  and  urlLink Mysterium Tremendum  for some well-written, thought-provoking stuff.   urlLink Jeremy  has added a Bush-ism of the day for those Bush supporters with a sense of humor.   I'll be playing softball and the guitar for much of this weekend. Have a good one.

      I'm not a sappy guy usually but this post is going to be sappy. You've been warned. :-)  Last night's small group lesson and  urlLink this post  over at  urlLink Mysterium Tremendum  made me really ponder something. How would my life have been different had certain people not entered into the picture at a certain time.  The people at  urlLink my church  already know this as I've said it a million and two times, but there's no way we'd still be in the town we are without their friendship. We moved here not knowing a soul and it was so lonely that first year. A  urlLink church family  is something that is very important to us because we don't hit the clubs or do any kind of bar scene and we were several hundred miles from either of our families. Secondly, I took a pay cut from delivering pizzas to becoming a visual journalist (imagine that). So, the money to go do anything that might give us social interaction was tight as well. We found  urlLink CCJ  but still didn't have friends there.  When we were getting ready to try and have a baby, Shannon and I talked at length about whether or not we were going to stay here. We decided to try for the baby and stick it out for (maybe) another year just for insurance reasons if nothing else. I was already involved in our praise band by then and was forming bonds there but, honestly, I still wanted to leave town and get back to Tennessee. When we started our small groups however, things began to turn around in a big way. People started viewing each other as 'family' instead of just 'our group.' After Isabella was born, one friend in particular really went the extra mile for us (as she continues to do). She treated Isabella as if she were her own daughter and treated us as if we were her brother and sister. I can't help but think that this is what was described in the Book of Acts (talking about the early church). I could go on and on but you get the picture. For those Christians who think a church family isn't important, I'd respectfully (and strongly) disagree with you. You  need  these people.  Another friend has been there for me during the most personal of struggles and for that, I can't express enough gratitude. This guy has been the person I shared long talks with about faith, life, love and doubt. I hope nothing but the best for him because he deserves, well, what we all  deserve  but I  want  for him the very best in everything.  I have been blessed by so many friends and I don't have the time to express to each of them how much they have meant to my life. I really believe God puts people in your life for a reason. I hope I have served some reason in the life of my friends because they definitely have in mine.

      I'm the "worship leader" at  urlLink my church.  This means I'm in charge of not only music, but also seeing that things get done in and during the worship services. I am currently looking for a good digital piano. We have a regular piano but we want something that can produce the sounds of a string section or several other effects.  I'm currently considering  urlLink this Korg, or one similar, at Musician's Friend.  i know Korg is supposed to be a good brand as several mega-churches use them frequently. I don't really understand the difference between a digital piano and a workstation though.  Anybody out there got any suggestions? I know we are probably going to have to spend $1500 or more to get a high-quality digital piano.   I'm clueless if it's not a guitar.

       urlLink      Check out  this Newsweek story.  urlLink iPod Nation: In just three years, Apple’s adorable mini music player has gone from gizmo to life-changing cultural icon   I love my iPod. In one of my  urlLink posts,  I referred to my iPod as the most important  material  thing I own. I guess if I was being honest, my car or house would be on that list but I also know that my iPod has changed the way that I listen to music and it has helped my health as well. Let's consider …  Since I got my 20 GB iPod and have put 4,617 songs on it:  — I've started paying for my downloads (this was partially because of my conscience as well) ;-) — I've started walking the 3/4 of a mile to work. That's one trip to work, one trip home for lunch, one trip back to work and a final trip home. That's roughly three miles on a given work day. Because of this, I've shed a few pounds and am starting to feel a little bit better about myself (physically). I'm still no specimen to be envied, but all the same, a few pounds is a few pounds that I didn't need. — I'm not much of an album listener anymore. I don't know if this is a good thing or not, but now, I mostly am a single-song listener who puts together multiple playlists. It's like my own personal radio station for whatever mood I'm in and where every song is one I like.  Very  cool. — The iTrip FM Tansmitter that I bought makes my IPod capable of playing through my home stereo or in my car. No more burning mix CDs in preparation for trips to Tennessee or Georgia. So, I'm not burning as many CDs anymore.  Just make a playlist and let it ride. Shannon and I have combined our favorites for a playlist called, well, "Our Favorites." It's a family affair. (Of course, she thinks I'm a bit too zealous about my iPod but she will still acknowledge that it is a cool gadget.)  I know the iPod is a total luxury item and one that I don't  need  but it is quite fun to have. I highly suggest getting one if you are in the market for a digital music player.

       urlLink      I miss the guitar solo.   I know that I'm biased because I'm a guitar player but I always felt like a good butt-kickin' guitar solo took a song to a whole new level. Notice how "Stairway To Heaven" utilizes Jimmy Page's beautiful solo to kick the song into fifth gear. Classic.  Recently, a guy at work loaned me his copy of  urlLink G3: Live in Concert  featuring Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. A veritable smorgasbord of gutar solos. My friend, Daniel Copeland, and I saw Satriani in concert in 1998 and we left just amazed at the level of technical skill displayed. However, the downside of the guitar solo was also on display that night. It can be too much of a good thing if it's done with no soul. It's hard for Satriani, Vai and the like to achieve the proper amount of soul because their songs are nothing but a big solo. But I digress …  Think about your average '80s glam metal song and there's a good example of a soul-less solo. The solo took the song nowhere and was just an excuse for the guitar player to show his chops (think most any Poison song). Eddie Van Halen kind of started this trend but EVH had a little more soul to his playing than the average knock-off. Slash, of Guns 'n Roses, started to reverse this trend with his more bluesy leads and the way he played for the song instead of playing against it (think November Rain or Sweet Child O' Mine). Then came grunge.   Many think Nirvana et al. eliminated the guitar solo but they really just minimized it it. "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  does  have a guitar solo. Albeit a repeat of the melody line. Pearl Jam had lots of guitar solos, just not in every song and they were always tasteful I thought. Then came the rap-metal phase of rock and guitar solos went the way of the T-Rex. Emphasis was now on groove and riffs. Players with any skill were sidelined and had to be content churning out the riffs. I always liked Creed's guitar player, Mark Tremonti because he came up with some monster riffs. Only on a few occasions did he have the chance to rip off a solo and when he did, it was always a good one. I wonder how many Creed songs could have been improved if Scott Stapp had shut up a little more and let Tremonti play a bit more. I'm hoping his post-Creed band will feature more of his playing and less of the posing that plagued Creed.  This is getting to be more of a ramble than anything so I will end it with a question. What are a few of your your favorite guitar solos? I'll answer mine in the first comment.

      I grew up on baseball. My dad turned me on to it when I was about six years old or so. I've loved it ever since. One of my biggest heartbreaks as a baseball fan was the 1986 World Series when I was pulling for the ever-unlucky Boston Red Sox against the New York Mets. Well … Mookie Wilson, Bill Buckner, etc. etc. Anyway, the Red Sox ace was Roger Clemens. I'm not a die-hard Red Sox fan but they are one of my top three favorite teams. So, naturally I was upset when Clemens went to the Toronto Blue Jays several years later for, you guessed it, more cash. I've always respected Clemens' abilities but never quite got over him leaving Boston to eventually play for the  bleeding Yankees.    Putz.  Now he's with the Houston Astros after "retiring" last season amid all the fanfare and hoopla that goes along with a legend retiring. Tonight, he starts the All-Star game for the National League. I'll pull for the NL anyway.  Read  urlLink An Open Letter to Roger Clemens  for a good chuckle.  Via  urlLink [rough draft]

      There has been (too) much debate in recent years about the style of music used in churches. Many fans of the contemporary approach shun all old songs and many fans of old songs seemingly shun anything written after 1899. As worship leader at my church, I try to do a mix of both. Sometimes we play old hymns in new ways, sometimes we play old hymns in old way and sometimes we play new songs. I think this is the best approach. That's just my opinion though. Today, I was listening to the Passion Worship Band's  Hymns: Ancient and Modern  on my iPod. One song they do is "How Great Thou Art." They arrange it in a new way and it sounds pretty good. (Note to all CCJ folks, I like our band's version  much better . But I digress...) Often, I have heard a song so many times that the meaning is kind of lost on me. I paid attention today though. "How Great Thou Art" may be one of the best praise & worship songs ever.   O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder, Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made; I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy power throughout the universe displayed.   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!   And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing; Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in; That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin.   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!   When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.  Then I shall bow, in humble adoration, And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"   Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art. Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee, How great Thou art, How great Thou art!    Go back and reread those lyrics, especially the second verse. God's grace is great, something I may never understand but I am so thankful that He provided it to me.

      Just FYI for all interested in yet another blog in the blogosphere: I have started a blog for the folks at my church, the  urlLink Christian Church of Jasper.  It is called  urlLink CCJ Freestyle.  There, those interested can discuss all matter of things related or unrelated to the church and Christendom in general. So far, it's going pretty well with 5 people or so accepting invitations to have posting rights. With this many bloggers, there's bound to be some good discussion eventually (shhhh, I'm secretly hoping for some sort of good hearty disagreement soon) ;-) and there are some good posts there already. Ch-Check it out. Comments are welcome from  anyone , church member or not.  This means that I have either posting rights or control in three blogs now.  urlLink The Thinklings,  my blogging start,  urlLink here at Alien Soil  and  urlLink CCJ Freestyle.   I'll do my best to keep up but not at the expense of real life. :-)

      I haven't gotten near enough sleep over the past few nights. It's really only a matter of going to bed earlier. There's always something to keep me up it seems. My eyes are getting heavy sitting in front of this computer at work. Anybody got a good suggestion for waking up (besides drinking coffee - blech!)?  I was in our community's Strassenfest (a town's celebration of its German heritage and an excuse for a lot of people to get really loaded at the beer garden) parade over the weekend. I haven't been in one since I was in Jr. High. Our church band played on a float. It was an outreach-type idea to the community. I think it went over pretty well. We made a lot of noise at least and we got to cover Switchfoot's  Meant to Live  about a half dozen times along the route. As weird as it may sound, it was quite fun. We got some puzzled looks but we got a lot more smiles and head-nodding along with the music and quite a few thumbs-up from the community. I think it was a good idea. Read more about it  urlLink here.   My sister is getting married in a little more than a week down in Nashville. I am supposed to scan in a bunch of photos for a slide show. I was expecting her to send me 20-30 total. I got about 70. I guess I'll be busy on that this week as I've only scanned in about 6 so far. I love Nashville(I lived there for 5 years) and I wish we could stay a little bit longer but this is a wedding-only type trip for the most part. I may be able to see a few people while we are there though. Hopefully.  My 1-year-old daughter is a wildcat. She is going through the 'pull everything out' phase. Everything that isn't bolted down is going to get scattered. I installed some child latches on cabinets the other night. If you ever want to hear me curse, come to my house while I'm doing some sort of home repair. The Super Handyman, I am not. I hate it but I really wish I was better at that type of stuff. I did manage to fix my broken toilet a week back with some assistance from drummer Mike Weisensteiner (tied for fifth on the Bonus Points Board). I was pretty proud of myself for that one.  My wife is now a blonde. She bleached her hair a few weeks back. It took some getting used to but it looks nice I think. I still say she married lower than she could have. ;-)  I read some Flannery O'Conner for the first time over the past few weeks. She's a great storyteller and she often uses the South as a setting, which is nice.  TV sucks in the summer. It's pretty bad when  I would rather watch 4 re-runs of  Everybody Loves Raymond  on TBS than new programming on the other channels.  There are a few new albums out that I want to listen to but, since CD money is not even on the family budget, I'll have to hear about it from you all. Anybody heard the post-Creed group Alter Bridge yet? (No smarmy comments, Copeland) ;-) How about the Nickel Creek/Toad the Wet Sprocket mash-up Mutual Admiration Society?  Hope everyone is healthy, wealthy and wise.

       urlLink This Esquire article  is probably the best, most balanced article I've read concerning George W. Bush. The author is most assuredly no fan of Bush but he's haunted by the notion that Bush may be right about The War on Terror.  I know I say every now and then that I don't want Alien Soil to be a political blog but I really thought this was a good commentary and very balanced (as balanced as it can be when it's written by a person with actual opinions). It is well worth your time no matter who you plan to vote for in the November elections.  A few key graphs:  The people who dislike George W. Bush have convinced themselves that opposition to his presidency is the most compelling moral issue of the day. Well, it's not. The most compelling moral issue of the day is exactly what he says it is, when he's not saying it's gay marriage. The reason he will be difficult to unseat in November—no matter what his approval ratings are in the summer—is that his opponents operate out of the moral certainty that he is the bad guy and needs to be replaced, while he operates out of the moral certainty that terrorists are the bad guys and need to be defeated. The first will always sound merely convenient when compared with the second. Worse, the gulf between the two kinds of certainty lends credence to the conservative notion that liberals have settled for the conviction that Bush is distasteful as a substitute for conviction—because it's easier than conviction.   …  We were attacked three years ago, without warning or predicate event. The attack was not a gesture of heroic resistance nor the offshoot of some bright utopian resolve, but the very flower of a movement that delights in the potential for martyrdom expressed in the squalls of the newly born. It is a movement that is about death—that honors death, that loves death, that fetishizes death, that worships death, that seeks to accomplish death wherever it can, on a scale both intimate and global—and if it does not warrant the expenditure of what the self-important have taken to calling "blood and treasure," then what does? Slavery? Fascism? Genocide? Let's not flatter ourselves: If we do not find it within ourselves to identify the terrorism inspired by radical Islam as an unequivocal evil—and to pronounce ourselves morally superior to it—then we have lost the ability to identify any evil at all, and our democracy is not only diminished, it dissolves into the meaninglessness of privilege.   NOTE: There is some language at the beginning of this commentary for those of you with sensitive eyes.  Via  urlLink Jen

      Check out  this article:   urlLink "My Problem with Fahrenheit 9/11" A military parent takes issue—strongly—with Michael Moore's controversial documentary, especially its portrayal of men and women in uniform. By Frank Schaeffer   I will gladly admit that I haven't seen Michael Moore's, um, "documentary." I have no plans to give the man even a fraction of a cent of my money. i've resited blogging on it because a.) I haven't seen it and b.) talking about it only drives more people to the theaters. However, I feel the hype has died down enough to link to this piece.  My brother, Marine Cpl. Steve Ross, served in Iraq. He saw the movie. He was not happy with Moore's portrayal of the military either.   The key few graphs are:  We never hear about patriotism, let alone loyalty to other soldiers. We never hear about our soldiers who were killed because they hesitated to shoot at enemies hiding behind civilians. Moore shows us the anomalies, not the mainstream. We see exploited African-American youth and white crackers and a few conscientious objector types. What we don't see is the real military majority—typical kids of all ethnic backgrounds who want to give something back to the country they honor.  Moore has every right to say whatever he wants about President Bush, to make him look like a simpering fool. Politics is hardball. He even makes some excellent points about our naive American relationship with the Saudis, and about our staggering lack of adequate response when we sent only 10,000 men to Afghanistan and missed our shot at bin Laden. He also comes close to telling the truth about the hysterical paranoia that leads to grandmothers being frisked in airports while nothing much is done about our real enemies.  But it's hard to take Moore's approach to the pre-invasion Iraq seriously—happy footage of happy children before the Americans bomb them. There is no sign of mass graves or gassed Kurds. Moore makes Saddam's Iraq look like an Islamic Disneyland.    I'm trying to keep politics off of Alien Soil as much as possible. I get my fill of it at work. I did think this was an excellent commentary though.  From  urlLink Christianity Today Movies
