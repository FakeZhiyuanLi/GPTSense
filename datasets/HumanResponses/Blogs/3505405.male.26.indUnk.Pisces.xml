						   I was stuck in traffic this morning on the way home from dropping my wife off at work.  While sitting there, staring at the drivers in the other cars, I got to thinking about the premise of a traffic jam.  Basically what jams traffic is some guy stopped at the front of an ever-growing qeue of cars.  Who is this guy?  What made him decide to set up camp in the middle of a highway?  I can understand when there is construction, but what about when there is absolutely no reason to be stopped.  What makes this person do it?  I've decided now that I want to be a traffic jammer.  My mission is now to be the cause of the gridlock on the highway.  But how to do it?  You see, most highways now have two or three lanes, and to be an effective traffic jammer I would need to block off all of them.  You could just block one, and cause a traffic slowdown by making everyone try to change lanes to go around you, but I don't want to just retard the process, I want to lock it up completely.  Now this is where my plan gets complicated.  It involves a prom limo rental, a vehicle hi-jacking, and an illegal cross-lane parking job on the highway.  Once stopped, I would get out of the vehicle and enjoy a picnic on the gravel shoulder, laughing maniacally at the chaos I've created.    Just as my plan begins to formulate in my mind, the guy in the car behind me starts honking.  Now there is a novel idea.  Maybe the people crammed bumper to bumper just needed a little reminder that they were stopped, and the annoying blare of this Ford Tempo's horn was just the tonic needed to get traffic flowing again.  This man would be heralded a traffic hero, saving us all.  We could have a parade, with animal shaped balloons.  However, no one moves, and the man just becomes an annoyance that makes me want to get out of my car and beat the living crap out of him.  The main problem now is the fact that others believe this man to be a genius, and have joined in, causing a symphony of horns to be blown into the morning air.  Now there are obviously too many people involved for me to deliver an effective beating, so I sit in misery, turning up the radio to try and drown out some of the noise.  It is right at this moment that the four cups of coffee I drank this morning decide to announce their presence in the form of a pressure on my bladder, and even worse, a cramp in my stomache signaling the need for more than just a quick urinal visit, or the ever so popular roadside watering.  Wonderful.  But just when my forced experiment in bladder and bowel pressure tolerances was about to come to a decidely unpleasant end, the traffic started moving again.  Moving rather quickly too, I might add, seeing as there was a complete standstill on this highway mere seconds ago.  Therein lies the mystery.  What caused this long stoppage in traffic flow?  I never did discover what it was that caused me to be locked in my highway jail cell for so long, nor who bailed me out and sent me back into society a free man.  The road was clear the rest of the trip home.  Am I free forever from its grip?  Unlikely. When will it strike again?  I don't know.  But I know that the evil traffic jammer is out there.  Waiting to prey on innocent drivers everywhere.  And who knows, if my plan ever comes to fruition, the elusive jammer could be me.  And just to make sure that I leave no loose ends, I feel it necessary to inform you that I did arrive, in the nick of time I might add, at a bathroom.  All ended well for me, but probably not so well for whoever cleans the stalls in that particular Burger King.  Until next time.......

						   As a worker with benefits I don’t usually think too much about prescriptions.  However, being a jaded, ignorant jerk, I do usually think about the process of getting one filled.  I look at the role of your everyday neighbourhood pharmacist.  I look at the years of schooling, and the degrees these guys need, and then I wonder, what kind of qualifications does this job seriously need?  I mean really?  I have watched pharmacists very closely (while hangin out for the mandatory 20 minute waiting period they enforce before you get your meds) and realize that you could get a trained monkey to do the same job.  How hard is their day?  They show up, decrypt a series of scribbles, take a bunch of pills from a big bottle, put them into a small bottle, then send you on your way.  That is their job.  If you gave me an economy size jar of Tylenol and said "Put 20 of these in this little bottle", I’m pretty sure I’d be up for the challenge.   So why is it that you need schooling for this?   I’m certain that as long as you can read and count you could perform this task pretty admirably.   Best of all, the stores generally give these workers a vantage point a good foot and a half above the average everyday Joe who needs a prescription filled.   This way they get the optimum amount of space required to push pills around.   I know that it would be an insurmountable task if they were on the same level as us.   They have to be a good head taller than those around them to perform at their optimum "pill moving" level.   Are they trying to feel more important?   Are they upset because doctors can make people remove their shirts?   Maybe to make them feel better we give them a spot to look down our shirts instead.   Not as good, but still effective.    I think that doctors don’t like pharmacists too much either.  I mean, they could easily print prescriptions in nice legible handwriting.  Instead, probably just to piss off the almighty pharmacist, they scribble something unintelligible on a scrap of paper and say "Screw you! Try to decode this one, jackass!!! "  Which I guess brings up another obvious question.  How do we know we actually got what we were prescribed?  We are really just taking this guys word for it.  He could be throwing Tic-Tac’s into a bottle and telling us it’s medication.  Who’s going to question him?  He probably can’t read the prescription and says, "Screw it! I don’t care what this guy needs, he’s getting some Altoid’s in a bottle and that’s it! "    But just to leave you with a reversed viewpoint, here’s my final thought.  What if the pharmacists are the real brains of the medical game?   What if the doctors are just scribbling on a paper because they have no idea how to cure anything?   Maybe the pharmacist is the one who really knows what’s going on.   The doctor throws in the towel, and the pharmacist has to figure out what it is that’s really going to cure you.   Kinda makes you wonder about those shady looking doctors.    Anyways, I'm outta here for now.  But beware, I'm on the hunt for my next target.  Piss me off, and it could be you.  Until next time....

						   I went shopping the other day and swung by the Wal-Mart for a few items.  A few items.  This is a term that no longer exists when you step through those doors.  You walk in to buy some Q-tips and walk out with a haircut, new tires, a happy meal and $800 worth of crap. Odds are you don't even get the Q-tips. And what's the deal with that greeter?  You know, that guy who stands by the front door saying "Hello, you need a buggy?"  But not to everyone, of course.  He needs to make sure that he is really selective about who he greets.  A high profile guy like that can't just talk to anyone, you know.  I have never once been greeted.  I've seen it done to others before, but never to myself. Makes a guy feel good.  I'm actually insulted to think that I am being looked down on by the Wal-Mart greeter.  Here's this guy looking like he couldn't even afford to shop there if he didn't work there, who has no education to speak of, who's main qualification for the job is the ability to breathe, and he's shunning me!!!  Very special indeed.  But that doesn't stop me.  I'll show them by shopping there every weekend.  That'll learn 'em who's boss.  Besides, who else will take back all my useless junk?  I mean really?  I return stuff I bought a year ago and they still take it.  Hell, I return stuff I never even bought there.  I walk in with an armload of stuff that I picked up at Zellers ten years ago, and sure enough they'll take it back.   And when did Wal-Mart become the place to beat your kids?  Every time I go in, there's at least one kid getting his ass whupped in there. Kids must be terrified of that place.  I think that's where you take them when they screw up. "Get in the truck, we're going to Wal-Mart". But fear not.  I have found an answer to the evil Wal-Mart corporation.  I want to open a store right next to it called “Mall-Mart”.  We will sell all the same items, but at a slightly lower price.  We will open 15 minutes later than them just to allow time for my employees to go in and check all their prices so we can sell it for 2 cents cheaper.  People will come.  We will provide a special “beating room” so people can go about punishing their kids in a safe a private environment as opposed to in the middle of the Rubbermaid aisle.  There will still be a McDonalds, but the difference will be that the mandatory park bench with the plastic Ronald McDonald sitting there will have a large sign hanging above it that says “Please DO stand on Ronald”  And the best part of it all is that anything we don’t sell we can return to Wal-Mart and get all of our money back.  Hiring soon.

						   A friend of mine is coming home from New Zealand in a couple of weeks and will be taking an excessively long flight to get here.  I don’t know how he can do it, seeing as I have never stepped on a plane before in my life.  I am terrified of flying.  Sure, people will tell me about how safe it is, and about how many people fly each year, or day, or minute.  I don’t really care.  I am doing everything in my power to stay on the ground when I travel.  Well maybe on water also, but only water that’s attached to the ground.  My friends and family try to provide me with statistics on the benefits and safety of flying, but I have some comparison stats of my own.  Well, maybe not concrete statistics, but some pretty good ideas.  For example, people say that there are more car accidents in a year than plane crashes.  Well, that’s obvious.  Especially when you consider the sheer number of cars on the road at any given time as compared to planes in the air.  You never really hear to much about nose to tail air traffic, or about planes smacking into each other on a daily basis while flying around.  Also, while on the topic of car accidents, you don’t get much of a warning when you get into an accident.  You’re driving, singing along with the hot new Britney Spears song on the radio and “BAM!!!!” accident city.   In a plane, you get time to think about it.  You start to descend……..and you start to scream…….and then you run out of air, so you take a deep breath…….then you scream again……..then you get up and go to the bathroom…….you order a drink and some nuts from the stewardess, maybe a pillow too………you get back to your seat in time to grab the oxygen mask that flops down from the ceiling……..you scream a bit more………then you finally crash.  Hmmmm, I think I’ll take the car accident.  Plus, the likelihood of surviving a car crash is much higher than your chances of surviving a plane crash.  You may be horribly disfigured, but alive.  However, the safety of flying makes me consider the salaries of pilots.  They make over $100,000 a year due to “The hazards involved with the profession.”  The hazards?  But we just heard that flying is so ridiculously safe.  Safer than driving a car.  In my opinion if people are going to get a higher salary for job hazards then pilots are seriously overpaid.  They get to travel in the safest method known to man, while us poor shmucks on the ground are driving around in death traps!  The real money should be given to cab drivers, they get into these ticking time bombs every day of their life!!!  Let the reward match the risk, I say.  Now last but not least, let’s talk about the boats.  I don’t have too many figures on boats, but if planes are the safest mode of travel then boats must be lower on the safety totem pole.  I’m thinking that maybe boats sink at a much more alarming rate than planes crash, but once again think of the survival chances.  On boats you can swim away, if you get far enough away before the suction pulls you below water when the boat goes under.  Then you only need to worry about getting tired and drowning, getting attacked by a hungry shark, or worse yet, getting tired and drowning while being attacked by a hungry shark.  Or you may be lucky and get in a lifeboat.  Not everyone gets a chance to ride in one, but your chances are not too bad.  Especially if you a woman or a child apparently.  Lucky for me, I am my mother’s child.  Save me a seat on the boat.  Anyways, I’m out of here.  Take it easy, and I’ll see you next time.
