						   I am never surprised about how far people will go to be so condescending. Today I realized that I have been lied to... Misrepresented, I am appalled that my life and tragedy's have become an open book. When does it stop? How do you ever know when someone is genuine? There is a deep sense of betrayal in me..... There are always two sides to every story. I thought forsure that everyone has good in them. I know differently now.... How do you begin to get over feeling betrayed? What do I believe in? My deepest feelings and life heartaches are being discussed and told as if they knew my pain! I cant understand. I never will. I know better. To love someone unconditionally I guess is to believe what they say.... Love them through hard times and always give benefit of doubt.. That's what I did. That's how I loved. I wanted to be given the chance a thousand time to know the truth.. But I was robbed, of my dignity and spirit. No one has the right to judge. No one knows my heartaches. No one but me. I have learned a lot from this whole ordeal. Trust no one. Be your bestfriend always.. I know I will never let me down.

						   I was just sitting here this weekend thinking..... why people do the things they do? I wonder do we do the things we do because we like to? Have to? Want or should do? I think most people want to make the "right" choice, but who is to say its right if it may not be what you really want? I have heard it said before that we only do things because it "works" .... meaning we get some kind of a payoff... Hmmm. I dont know about that. To me the best way of ever really knowing if its right is if its true. If it feels good. If only we made all choices in life based on those terms.... instead of doing whats "right" by someone elses standards.... I think by doing what feels good sets your own.

						   I am going to start planning for a wine tasting party that I want to have this fall. Its something that I have always wanted to do. My plan is to get a few close friends and family together and have good food and wine. "Eat Drink and Be Merry". Have some fun, listen to good music and have a good memory!!! Its something that I want to have annually. Last year I started a "Pumpkin Carving Party" for the kids, that was a lot of fun. I made little aprons for all the kids to wear so they wouldn't dirty their clothes. It was really cute. I love to entertain. I love my friends and family and any reason to have us all together is a good one I think! SO... I need to start planning this party because the fall is just around the corner and I need to do my research. I found another really good website to help me with the planning www.hosting-a-wine-tasting-party.com.... Fun,Fun Cant wait!!!

						   I found a website that was very interesting to me...www.rivermaya.com. Its all about yoga!!! I ordered a couple of books that they recommend. I  have always been drawn to yoga, I think that its the discipline and technique that pulls me in. I danced 8 yrs for a studio and always loved doing recitals and competitions. I love how with music and dance combined a story is told. Yoga helps me to relax and have a moment that is mine to put things in perspective. Anyway I enjoyed the site, and thought I would share!! urlLink

						   Today is a new day. A better day! What once was ugly and dark is beginning to show signs of light. I am better today than yesterday, smarter, wiser and less nieve. A little tougher but in a good way. Always cautious and aware. Time is a good thing. I am letting go of the anger, its ugly. I am not. I am true, I believed. That's okay. I know better. With time I will see more. Become less nieve, more aware. Love yourself. Trust isn't something you can demand. Love isn't either. With all grief there is a reason. With time good things come. I am big on Karma. I am big on being the better one. I am, no doubt. Always true always real always. Strong and true. People who prey on weakness are weak themselves. It takes more courage to admit fault and be true than coward your way through life. It takes a strong person to make a day there's in a time of pain and betrayal. There will always be "people" who manipulate and look out for themselves no matter the cost. Its the strong who can see it... Its the weak who are blind. Its a lesson that cant be taught only learned.
