      Today I had a dentist appointment. Perfect teeth, once again, but she said I have to brush a certain way to keep from getting plague at the base of my teeth. (Not that your interested)  On another note, we heard about my dad's job situation today....I know some of you are anxious to hear the out come....                                                                  He didn't get it, meaning I'm staying! I'm not quite sure how I feel about it, cause I know he is disappointed.  Seth

      Being that this is my first  official  post in my  official  blog, I think I'll tell you about some recent occurences in my life. Starting in late June...   June  Well nothing much happened in June. I was finishing up school work and stuff. A definite highlight of my summer was going to elementary camp with my church. I was really nice to go cause I was at a point where I was ready to break down with the other church related issues. I'm always running around doing stuff for people and even though I went to camp to work, it was still great to get away for a week. Its so odd how God works...the band left for camp the Sunday because we had to set up and prepare for the arrival of the other churchs monday. On the way up to St. Petersburg, James (our bassist) was making fun of a song that our music pastor was introducing in a couple of weeks. The song, "Trust God", was really simple and had a quality that just seemed stupid; however, our teasing turned out to be rather ironic by the end of the week...  We got to St. Petersburg and everything was going fine till Monday morning. First thing we woke up to was "Some guy took the van our kids are supposed to come up in..." which was then followed by "Lance was in a  major  car accident." As the morning progressed, the problems continued. The leaders at church decided to ditch the van and go for the old school bus. Scott decided to bring up the luggage in his truck with a trailer (which also had Rob's golf cart), but the ball bearings on the trailer gave way and scatter across the road, so he was stuck. Eventually, Scott got up to St. Petersburg (a little after the bus got there). We didn't hear very much about Lance for the rest of the day, as we were all busy welcoming the kids and the band getting ready for the first night. This is what I was told after we had been back from camp: Lance crashed into a flat bed garbage truck and was pronounced  dead  on the scene. He was air lifted and revived (what a miracle). Whats more, the car was completely totaled and everything was crush  except  the area around the drivers side. Lance has made an almost 100% recover and only has a scar on his arm.  Anyways, the week went on at camp. I was worried about Lance, but there wasn't really much I could do...So anyways, like I said, the week went on. Tension was kinda high after a couple days because I was a little upset with Rob because he seemed to be ignored a lot of what I was doing and constantly see what I wasn't doing. We got that sorted out Thursday (the last night) and the rest of the night was awesome. And here comes that song again...James was the band leader at camp, so he was in charge of music during the invitationals. Thursday night, he decided to play "Trust God"...  FRIDAY!!! Oh what an interesting day....All my kids were packed up, the rooms were clean, sign a few shirts, eat breakfast, hop on a bus, and off we go! I was in the van with the rest of the band. The van was carrying the trailer with all our equipment (several $1000 worth). So after we had stopped for lunch, we were on the road again. 1 exit away from Alligator Alley, Ron (the only guy from our group that was behind the van) called and told us the trailer had a huge bubble on it. Needless to say, we got off at the exit, stopped the van, and POP!!!!!! Now the significance: Alligator Alley is a 2 hour drive across the everglades....no exits, gas stations, cities,  anything , but marsh land and animals. If we had gone on to alligator alley with that bubble, not only would we have been stuck there for hours, we would have probably flipped if the bubble had popped. Thats 10 or so lives in danger and several $1000 of equipment destroyed. And there is that song again, in my head... "Trust God, from the bottom of your heart...don't try to figure out, anything on your own..."   After Camp...  Well not much happened after camp...came back to finish up some more school, but a highlight was meeting a "person" I am now "rather fond of..."  Actually, I take that back...A lot happened after camp...I came home and was told that my dad applyed for a job in Tallahasee and there lies my current situation...we have heard nothing about the job since his interview (August 12th)....I guess no news is good news?  With the stress of the job situation and school starting, I've become rather irritated with things at church. The youth group seems to have become less youth centered and I'm actually sick of it. I've considered dropping the band because of it.  Anyways, thats all for tonight.  Seth
