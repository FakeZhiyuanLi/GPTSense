             I graduated from Clemson University in December 2003. I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I loved my time at Clemson, and was sad to see it go, but also very happy it was over. I look forward to my new career and my life. It will be an adventure. Good things will come.     Check out  urlLink Clemson University  Webpage for more info on my school.

         Something im looking into. I checked out Roswell Bicycles a few days ago and was shown this bad boy, Giant NRS 2. Im looking to get into a full suspension ride and becoming more agressive on the trails. I also met someone today at Blankets Creek that recommended the Specialized M4 Stumpjumper.

       urlLink Santa Cruz Bikes     Took another ride at blankets creek today. Very impressed once again. I was able to do the intermediate loop in 23 min. I took a slow ride on the advanced trail. The weather was perfect, mid 80's, no humidity, not a cloud in the sky. Now its off to another week of work :(. I saw a lot of different bikes that I could find myself purchasing. There were quite a few of the Santa Cruz Blurs riding around out there. I Think they might be a little pricey for me...but it looks like a great bike.

      Watched a little bit of the democratic convention tonight.  Saw a couple of things I liked, and a few that I didnt.  First thing was this  urlLink Barack Obama  guy.  Wow, he was an absolute incredible speaker.   He got me believing for a minute that the government should be responsable for all the problems in the world, and in our country.  At least hes passionate, and caring.  He will be good for the democratic party, hes at least positive in his message.  The second speaker I saw was Ron Reagan Jr.  He spoke on stem cell research.  I guess I never really knew what the deal was with this science, but it looks promising.  Im all for it, as long as it is strictly monitored.  I do fear that someone will definatly try to clone themselves, or that we will eventually clone soldiers, but I also fear that millions are suffering every day from diseases that could be cured by this research.  It gives me more to consider.  Ill have some thinking to do now for the next couple of days, but I still think my vote will be  red .

           This is a picture taken a few months ago at Dobbins ARB airshow. The blue angels were in town and it was a great show. I was able to find a grassy spot just off of cobb parkway for a great view. If youve never gotten a chance to go to an airshow I highly recommend that you do. Its absolutely amazing what these machines can do. Its a great feeling to know that these men and women are on our side. I hope all that have done wrong in this world against americans fear the wraith of what is coming, its awesome power. Now, im not a bully, or a war monger, but sometimes push comes to shove. While we are at war with Iraq, and other terror organizations, I will be supportive, until the job is done. God bless our troops, and come home safe.

      Up late at night I always wonder whats waiting out there for me?  Are there things I should be doing differently?  Im looking, but im not finding.  Maybe thats what im supposed to be doing right now, but im not very content doing it.  I am very thankful for the things that I have, and the good fortune that has blessed me.  I just dont feel content yet...and maybe that will take time.  I guess good things come to those who wait.  That is definatly me......

         Ive been working really, really hard to do well in work, stay in shape, find new friends, and be an overall good person.  I think that has been adding a new element of stress to my life that im not used to.    I saw something today that really kinda wrapped up what I think might be happening.  A father and young daughter were at the pool today.  He was trying to teach her to swim.  She was having lots of trouble getting air because she was struggling to swim.  He said, "Honey, relax....do you realize that there are really good swimmers that drown because they panic and try to hard to stay a float?  You have to relax, and go with the flow"  I know, I know, sounds stupid, but it makes sense.  What I realized is that I have to try hard to swim, but if I relax, ill still float...and be ok.

       urlLink Independence Air   Looks like a promising airline.  It flys mainly out of DC, but is connecting all over the east coast.  I can find cheap tickets from Atlanta home to Burlington VT for 240$ round trip.  Not bad at all.

       urlLink Cheap airline tickets, hotels, car rentals, cruises and vacations - Yahoo! Travel   I love using this page to find good deals on airline tickets.  The best option is to leave yourself with lots of options.  I always search with "my dates are flexible" to find the lowest fare.  I can then pick travel times that work best for me.

        Headed up to Nashville late saturday night to hang with my ole college buddy mikey. It was definatly good to get out of ATL for a little while, even if only for a few days. We went out to Demonbruen street SP? Had a few drinks, and heard the worst singer on earth! Yes...worse then me. I got to see Mershawn again too. Too bad she was hurting with a busted up hand...but she was more then a sweetheart to me. Thanks again guys!
