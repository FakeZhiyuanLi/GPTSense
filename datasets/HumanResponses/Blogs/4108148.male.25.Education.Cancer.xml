      I had a good time tonight with D-bo.  We went out for Pizza and saw Jermaine there.  He is tuly the most electrified man in all of the Fredonia Pizza circles!  D-bo and I got talking and ended up on the meaning of the Jar of Flies title to an Alice in Chains Album.  Here's a clip from an interview with AIC former front man Layne Staley with Hit Parader.  HP: First off, where did the title Jar Of Flies come from?   LS: It came from a science experiment (AIC guitarist) Jerry Cantrell did  when he was in the third grade. They gave him two jars full of flies.  One of the jars they overfed, the other jar they underfed. The one they  overfed flourished for a while, then all the flies died from  overpopulation. The one they underfed had most of the flies survive all  year. I guess there's a message in there somewhere. Evidently that  experiment had a big impact on Jerry.

           It seems like today was non stop running, or actually hobbling around in my case.  The high point was grabbing some good Chinese take out for lunch with R at the Holy Wong, which is my favorite take out place in the D + F area.  This afternoon, I bounced between work, the laundromat, and my place trying to get stuff done, so I can feel like I am getting ahead.        I forgot to mention this previously, but I saw a great trailer by V for a doc she is doing about gay and lesbian weddings in the New Paltz area.  If I can find the URL again, I will have to post it.         A couple of interesting things I noticed while going around D + F earlier -   1) The Village Limits neon sign is gone, and now there is a new neon sign that says Valentine's.  It will always be Village Limits to me.  I have so many good memories of that place.  Remember the times we would guess how many mullets we could see in one night?  How about the Fish doing his thing to the Cha Cha slide on the stage?  Could I ever forget the time when Salim hit on two girls that were dancing and he then got invited to their wedding?  ...K-Lo dancing on the bar at her 21st b-day while she was wearing a huge yellow foam cowboy hat that had her address on the side of and said If found please return to.   The great numerous happy hours there for the free food.  I recall the time Gman got yelled out by Junior because he thought G was a Dolphin's fan.  All the times with TJ, Steph, and Mel D were awesome too.  Village - we will remember you!  RIP Village Limits.  2) Arby's In Fredonia no longer offers baked potatos!  This truly bothers me for the fact that Vegetarians should be able to eat unhealthy fast food and suffer the consequences of ill health just like their carniverous counterparts.  I wonder if this is a regional thing or national thing. On the topic of fast food, I am hoping to catch SuperSize Me at the Opera house this weekend.

           Cool!  I just found out K-Lo is going to the same Bills game I am.  Hopefully we'll be able to meet up before the game for some fun tailgate action!   K-lo, if you want to hustle some people in a pickup football game in the parking lot before the game, let me know.        I just got back from getting my Haircut.  Yes, its been about a couple weeks, so it was needed ; ) I did end up going to Charlie's, but I was really considering going back to Famous Hair.  Last week, my ex that manages there stopped by my place to talk.  It was the first we've talked since we split.  Surprisingly, it was a really good time and didn't feel awkward at all.  She said that one of my favorite girls that work there was bothering her to talk to me to get me back there.  I know I will end up going back sometime, because Mary cuts the best hair in town - I should know since I have been to almost every place around.      The mystery of the wildflowers has been solved.  Last week, I saw some flowers left at the door going up to my place.  I wasn't sure if they were for me or one of my neighbors.  It turns out they were for my neighbor.  I'm relieved.  This means no stalker for me!  Yeah!

            After work today, I went to see my Physical Therapist.  The appointment went well.  So far, its just Ultrasound and some shock treatment to work the muscles.  Tony was really surprised how much voltage I was taking with the shocks.  He stood back and looked me up and down in disbelief, as he said my whole leg should be kicking with the amount of electricity going to my foot.  I think this could be an indicator of two things.  Either I can attribute it to my high tolerance for pain, or that I actually did damage nerves more than I thought when I screwed up some of the disks in my spine.  I'm personally hoping more for the high tolerance option.         Not too much else happened tonight.  I grabbed some Subway with a good veggie sub, had some good spaghetti, went to the driving range, and lifted some weights.  Overall, it was a good laidback night.  I didn't do too well at the driving range, but I did manage to hit my last ball at least a couple hundred yards into the darkness with the five iron, so that was a good note to end on.  I also tried calling Mr B, but all the cell phone circuits in Las Vegas must have been busy.

            I've been thinking about blogging it for a while, and after a good cheese calzone I decided this was the day to do it.             Anyways, Its sad to see the weekend dwindling away.  Yesterday, was an awesome time at the movies.  Ielle and I left the Dunkirk/Fredonia realm to venture to the regal to catch a few flicks.  We caught the Village and The Manchurian Candidate.  Both were really good in their own ways, and much better seen in a real Theater, rather than catching them at the local Ghettoplex.  Trying to stay off of my feet because of Tendonitis in my Achilles hasn't been too bad.  If anything, its been encouraging me to get back into my love of watching movies.        On the way back from the movies, we drove by Ralph Wilson Stadium where the Buffalo Bills play their homegames. It reminded me of how I've always wanted to catch a Bills game in person.  After arriving home, I decided to act on the desire and now I know where I will be on Halloween.  Yes, I will watching the Bills from 13 rows back from the field : )

      The title of this posting comes from the wisdom of a fortune cookie.   Okay, I did add the "in Bed" part to the end, but it did actually say "drink to your health" on it.  This fortune definitely ranks up in the top 10 I've ever received.  Yesterday, my folks came into town.  We ended up going to dinner at Kettle and Keg and having the best restaurant made eggplant parm from around the D+F area.   Then, we went to the Opera House and we watched Supersize Me.  It was a really good documentary and my parents both liked it as well as myself.  Afterwards, a feeling of sickness overcame me.  I realized eating out for the past few weeks probably hasn't been one of my healthiest choices.  My new resolution is to get back into cooking and eating healthier.  Today, the rents and I went on a Winery tour.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a fellow Vegetarian that I knew working there.  She gave us an excellent tour and it was good to catch up with her for a bit. I wonder if she noticed that my Mother was wearing one of her PETA T shirts?  My father and I sampled some Vidal Ice Wine and it was really good and really decently priced.  I really should have picked up a bottle of it : (   Other interesting and cool stuff that I would elaborate on, but I am tired and in need of sleep - We stopped at a farm stand and bought some great produce.  My Mother and I made some good Pizzas.  I found out at PT that I am able to take over twice the amount of electricty that an average person can take.  We went and saw Bourne Supremacy, which was fairly good besides some minor technical picky stuff.  D-bo forwarded me an e-mail indicating that some people are interested in buying Barker.

      In the past several of weeks, my work to play ratio has been extremely one sided and not on the side that I would prefer.  I feel good though, as I am accomplishing a ton that will not only help out myself, but will provide a better opportunity for others as well.  I really do feel proud of what I am able to accomplish.  I also value the challenge in everything.  After that all said, I can't wait until early September rolls around.  I need to make up for lost play time : )  Tomorrow, I am looking forward to seeing my parents.  They will be arriving in the evening and then they will departing on Thursday.  I haven't seen my Father since we went to Wrigley Field to see the Cubs in June, and I haven't seen my Mother since June either, so its been a while.  So far on the agenda is some movie watching and other non walking activities.  I am looking forward to it as it should be a good break.  R and I did the pizza challenge today for lunch.  We each bought a large pizza from dominos with Onions, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Pineapple, Jalapenos, and Hot Banana Peppers.  The objective was to see who could consume more of their pizza with the lofty goal of trying to finish the whole thing.  I consider myself a competitive person, but I have to give it to R.  He ended up beating me by a good slice or two

      Today was a good day.  Okay, it was a great day.  I took today off and it felt so good to sleep in, catch up on things around the apartment, get a clean review from the dentist, make some good food, and just lay low.  Its back to the office tomorrow though. I'm gonna bust my tail and hope I can get enough done to have this coming weekend off.    I've been on this weird AM radio kick lately.  It just seems like there are no good call in shows anymore on FM, and that local talk radio is dying for the most part.  I was listening to a show where people would call in with the best life lessons they have. One of the least profound was that some guy called up and said his was "Always keep your beer cold".    I did go to the track today!  Tony wants me to do a bit at a time to build strength and test my tendon to see how it feels.  Track, watch out!  You are going down!

      Last Night, I went out to work on getting some play in the work to play ratio.  I went out with Ms B and her BF, and ielle.  Then, I saw Nothing, R, Enser, Pam, Alan(Happy B-day buddy!), Clint, Jermaine, Tommy, and Chrissy out.  It was a great times.  After working my booty off without much fun time lately, I definitely needed the break.  It was good to catch up with K-lo over the phone too earlier.  With only about a week left of putting in extra time for work, I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  After this, I plan on catching up with everyone more.  It seems like everyone's summer has been crazy and there just hasn't been enough time for everything that everyone wanted to do.    I really believe the older I get the faster time seems to go.  I remember as a kid I would ask my mother how long it would be before dinner or something along that line.  When she responded with an hour I would feel like it would be forever that I would have to wait, and it seemed like the time may never pass.  Now, when I think about something being an hour away, I think what short time I have, and how an hour never seems like enough time to get whatever done before its on to the next thing.  My grandmother tells me that for her the years now pass by as days did when she was a young child.  It makes me feel that we need to slow things down and value what we have.  After all, time is not an endless well.  I've been thinking a lot lately on the concept of lust.  I am inclined to think that something about our society and culture is lust driven.  Maybe, its part of the American myth of being bigger, faster, stronger, newer, and then that trickles down into our daily personal  beliefs.  It just seems like the advertising agencies and other areas take advantage of this.  I could really go off on this, but just think how you lust for fast food, or how people lust for the images of two dimensional characters on the silver screen.  Does this sow the seeds of internal discontent along the masses by making people dissatsified with themselves and their lives?
