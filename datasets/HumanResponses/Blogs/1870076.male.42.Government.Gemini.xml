      While being interviewed on his campaign jet, General Wesley Clark, The Decisive One, became confused when questioned about his position on authorizing the use of force against Iraq.  So, he yelled for Mary, his secretary to give him a hand with the tough questions.  This is a real gem:   "Mary, help!" he called to his press secretary, Mary Jacoby, at the front of the plane, as he faced questions about Iraq. "Come back and listen to this." At one point, Ms. Jacoby interrupted the interview, which included four reporters who were traveling on the general's jet, to make certain that General Clark's views on the original Iraq resolution were clear. "I want to clarify — we're moving quickly here," Ms. Jacoby said. "You said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a U.N.-based solution." "Right," General Clark responded. "Exactly."    urlLink The full article can be found in the  New York Times .

      In spite of the September 10th American’s blind hatred of George Bush, progress in the War on Terrorism will continue, and evidence of Saddam’s support of international terrorism (like we didn’t already have enough) will daily unfold.  While the Left exerts all its devilish energy questioning Bush’s integrity, increasingly being answered is the question, “Where did Saddam steal away his WMD?”  They will be found.  And, God help the country that is storing them.  From  The Federalist :   There are additional intelligence reports this week supporting previous evidence The Federalist reported in November of '02 that Iraq shipped some of its biological and nuclear WMD stores to Syria and the Bekaa Valley. This comes on top of last week's assessment from Israel's Mossad that Syrian strongman Bashar Assad allowed Saddam's primitive nukes (possibly with cores for three) to transit through Syria to a protected site in Lebanon's heavily fortified Bekaa Valley.  Former Iraqi Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad, defense minister under Saddam's Ba'athist regime, surrendered yesterday to Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the 101st Airborne Division. After weeks of negotiations, Ahmad turned himself in on the condition that his name be removed from the U.S. military's "55 most-wanted" list, meaning he will not be subject to indefinite confinement and will possibly be shielded from prosecution. The move to accept the former minister's surrender on these terms is hoped to quell some of the guerilla violence that continues to threaten U.S. troops on the ground in Iraq.  For the record, on Wednesday President George Bush reiterated the administration's position that Saddam Hussein is not known to have directly conspired with al-Qa'ida in the commission of the September 11 terrorist attacks, though the former Iraqi regime's ties with the terrorist group were strong: "We have no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with...September 11," said President Bush, adding, "There's no question that Saddam Hussein had al-Qa'ida ties."    National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice remarked that  the administration has "never claimed that Saddam Hussein had either direction or control of 9/11."  Dr. Rice went on to say, "What we have said is that [Saddam] supported terrorists, helped to train them, but most importantly that this is someone who, with his animus toward the United States, with his penchant for and capability to gain weapons of mass destruction, and his obvious willingness to use them, was a threat in this region that we were not prepared to tolerate."

      The left keeps trotting out the Vietnam analogy with respect to Iraq.  Bozell points out in  urlLink his article  how absurd this is.  I really think Americans are getting tired of this tactic.  Fifty years from now, very few will be left who'll remember Vietnam.  What will the Left do then?

      Is this not incredible?  The 21st century has changed the way we all can keep a journal.  From cave drawings to sheets of paper stored in a desk drawer to a bound journal stored on a shelf to this.  Incredible!  Now the entire world, the entire connected world, can read my musings and ruminations.  Not by happenstance will one stumble upon a torn and tatter, yellow-paged journal located in some musty and dusty attic.  It's right here in Cyberspace for all to see.

      Scandal is in the air, and the Dems are ecstatic.   urlLink This Opinion Journal article  looks at the political agenda driving this non-scandal, which is the removal of Karl Rove.    I am fond of this insightful observation offered at the conclusion of the editorial: "It's especially amusing to see the media whose lifeblood is leaks feigning outrage."  Indeed.  Or this wonderful tidbit:  "They [the Democratic presidential hopefuls] can suddenly posture as great defenders of the CIA and covert operations, though some of them spent the decades before 9/11 assailing both."

      John Kerry and Teresa, ever the average Americans worth billions, treated John Edwards and his wife, ever the average Americans worth millions, to a dinner at Wendy's, an average American restaurant, during a break in their cross-country bus tour.   There, John Kerry, the war hero, spies some guys in uniform having a quiet lunch, until John Kerry, in the words of one of the Marines, "imposed on [them]."  Will they be voting for this self-proclaimed war criminal?  Unlikely.   One of the Marines, a sargeant, said, "I'm 100 percent against [him]."  Go Marines!

      This from MyWay:   NEWBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - John Kerry said Friday he would put Osama bin Laden on trial in U.S. courts rather than an international tribunal to ensure the "fastest, surest route" to a murder conviction if the terrorist mastermind is captured while he is president.     (For the rest of the article, click  urlLink here .)    The "fastest, surest route" to a conviction?  In our courts?  Give me a break.  How many death row convicts have been on death row for years due to appeal after appeal after appeal?  Who would defend Osama?  Johnny Cochran? Al Dershowitz?  This demostrates that the Democrats still, after the unprecedented attact on our a country, consider global terrorism a law enforcement issue.

      This is a great observation from David Frum's Diary&nbsp;on the Clinton speech at the Democratic Convention:     Clinton has a riff about about&nbsp; [sic] &nbsp;how the Republicans are cutting taxes for millionaires like him. This is effective stuff! Who wants to see Bill Clinton get more money? I wonder whether John Kerry will pick up the theme. His family is at least 60 times richer than Bill Clinton’s. Think how much bigger his family’s tax cut would have been – that is, if his family actually paid taxes. Fortunately for them, their money is protected by trusts and careful planning. So the taxes that will actually be raised will fall on people who earn less than Bill Clinton and have far, far less than John Kerry: for instance, you.

         urlLink Kerry Campaign Blasts Cheney Criticism of 'More Sensitive' War Remark     Seems the Kerry campaign is a bit miffed at Cheney's recent response to Kerry's "sensitive war on terror" remark.    "A sensitive war will not destroy the evil men who killed 3,000 Americans," Cheney said in remarks Thursday. "The men who beheaded Daniel Pearl and Paul Johnson will not be impressed by our sensitivity."  "Dick Cheney's desperate misleading attacks now have him criticizing George Bush's own words, who called for America to be 'sensitive about expressing our power and influence,'" said Kerry spokesman Phil Singer in a statement.  "[What] Dick Cheney doesn't understand is that arrogance isn't a virtue, especially when our country is in danger. Alienating allies makes it harder to hunt terrorists and bring them justice. If Dick Cheney learned this lesson instead of spending his time distorting John Kerry's words, this country would be a safer place," Singer added.        The Bush speech to which the Kerry campaign refers can be found  urlLink here . This is the statement in context:     Precisely because America is powerful,  we must be sensitive about expressing our power and influence.   Our goal is to patiently build the momentum of freedom, not create resentment for America itself.  We pursue our goals; we will listen to others; we want strong friends to join us, not weak neighbors to dominate. In all our dealings with other nations, we will display the modesty of true confidence and strength. [Emphasis mine]     We are the world's nonpareil  superpower, sharing, unlike during the Cold War, that title with no one; none come close to match us militarily or economically--a tremendous responsibility for a nation to shoulder. Never has a nation been so positioned as America to dominate the world by force, to establish Pax Americana, to bend nations of the world to our will, if we were so inclined. Instead, we humbly shoulder this incredible responsibility because we are America, because we desire "to patiently build the momentum of freedom." We are sensitve in the use of our power and influence insofar as we appreciate the sovereignty of freedom-loving nations, of those nations aspiring to be free, to build democratic institutions, to be counted among the civilized nations of the world. Those nations need not fear America, as we will be sensitive in the use of that power and influence.  Those nations, however, whose goals are to undermine America's national interests to the detriment, not only of our freedom, but of freedom across the globe, who support international terrorists, financially, logistically, materially, who provide safe haven for terrorists, will not be on the receiving end of an America seeking sensitve ways to express our power and influence. No. They will be on the receiving end of an America radically determined to use our power to vigililantly fight for our survival and, hence, the survival of freedom across the world.

      Unemployment Claims Down     The Department of Labor   urlLink  reported today    that unemployment claims fell last week by 4,000 to 333,000. This drop brings the four-week average down to 339, 250. Levels below 400,000 are widely perceived to reflect a healthy, growing workforce. See   urlLink  this graph    of recent trends in unemployment claims to see how much progress has been made over the past year.    The  urlLink  New York Times  reported today :       Economists saw both the rise in retail sales and a decline of 4,000 in the number of laid-off workers filing for jobless benefits, reported by the government Thursday, as hopeful signs the economy is rebounding from a worrisome pause in activity in the early summer.

      An excerpt from the Jim Geraghty's Kerry Spot:     Kerry's incoherent, sort-of-for, sort-of-against, shapeless gray blobs of linguistic ooze make debating his views impossible, because here's nothing to support or to dispute. Kerry never comes out and clearly and consistently advocates one position that the voters can either endorse or reject. As the public mood shifts, so does he. And he always leaves the wiggle room, the subordinate clause with caveats that nullifies the original statement.      Read the entire article  urlLink here .

      Selective Reduction!  Amy Richards, freelance writer, shares the following in a  New York Times  article:      I found out I was having triplets when I went to my obstetrician. The doctor had just finished telling me I was going to have a low-risk pregnancy. She turned on the sonogram machine. There was a long pause, then she said, ''Are you sure you didn't take fertility drugs?'' I said, ''I'm positive.'' Peter and I were very shocked when she said there were three. ''You know, this changes everything,'' she said. ''You'll have to see a specialist.''

      Lance Armstrong is, undeniably, a great athlete and an inspiring overcomer.  It is unfortunate that this man, this mere mortal of a man, would attribute his success not to God but to mere mortal men and science:    In reply to a question of how his belief in God had helped him as a patient, he replied: "Everyone should believe in something, and I believed in surgery, chemotherapy and my doctors."   Is he, as the author of  urlLink this article  claims, a role model for success?  In a secular, worldly sense, yes he is.  People today, especially the children, are in desperate need of men and women who model persistence, a strong work ethic, and goalsetting.  However, Lance's "positive attitude, his take-charge approach, his refusal to accept defeat -- his desire not only to live but to live victoriously..." are not enough.  It's a start, but it is not enough.  We, as a society, as a culture are in more need of men and women for whom God is the source of their inspiration, for whom a positive attitude is an attitude shaped by God, for whom living victoriously is to live for Christ.   Lance Armstrong is an incredible man who has overcome incredible difficulties and who has performed an incredible feat.  But, he is just a man, a mere mortal, for whom science and technology will offer no hope, for his body or for his soul, when he arrives at the inevitable end of life's journey, when surgery, chemotherapy, or doctors will be of no use.  May Lance Armstrong come know the One from Whom life is given and for Whom life is to be lived.  Then will Lance Armstrong's life be a life worth emulating.

      If, as in previous elections,  urlLink people vote with their pocketbook , which they do even in wartime, President Bush has a very good chance of staying at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Three prominent forecasting models (Macroeconomic Advisers,  urlLink Yale professor Ray Fair , and  urlLink Economy.com ) predict a sizable win for the incumbent. Ray Fair's (author of   urlLink Predicting Presidential Elections and Other Things )  Presidential Vote Equation model, explains the prediction this way:    The predictions of GROWTH, INFLATION, and GOODNEWS for the previous forecast from the US model (February 5, 2004) were 3.0 percent, 1.9 percent, and 3, respectively. The current predictions from the US model (April 29, 2004) are 3.2 percent, 2.0 percent, and 3, respectively. In the previous forecast 2004:1 was predicted to be a GOODNEWS quarter, but it turned out not to be. For the current forecast 2004:2 is predicted to be a GOODNEWS quarter, so the total number of GOODNEWS quarters is the same at 3. The economic predictions thus changed very little. The prediction of GROWTH, the per capita growth rate in the first three quarters of 2004 at an annual rate, has increased to 3.2 from 3.0 for the previous forecast, and the prediction of INFLATION has increased from 1.9 to 2.0. These new economic values give a prediction of 58.74 percent of the two-party vote for President Bush rather than 58.68 percent before. The main message that the equation has been making from the beginning is thus not changed, namely that  President Bush is predicted to win by a sizable margin.

      John Kerry, ever-fructuous in finding a cheap shot, has a few words to say about George Bush's reaction or lack of reaction, on September 11th, 2001, to the news being whispered in his ear by a top aide while the President was sitting before a group of elementary kids in their classroom.     "Had I been reading to children and had my top aide whispered in my ear, 'America is under attack,' I would have told those kids very politely and nicely that the president of the United States had something that he needed to attend to -- and I would have attended to it."    So what did John Kerry do on September 11, 2001? Well,  urlLink National Review Online  brings to us via  urlLink Red State  the following from a Larry King interview:    "...And as I came in [to a meeting in Sen. Daschle's office], Barbara Boxer and Harry Reid were standing there, and we watched the second plane come in to the building. And we shortly thereafter sat down at the table and then we just realized nobody could think, and then boom, right behind us, we saw the cloud of explosion at the Pentagon..."     "Nobody could think"? This man who would be president could not think?   I remember that classroom scene vividly. I remember a journalist asking him a question about the attack, and, in response, the President said, along these lines, "This is not the place for that now." I thought to myself then, "He doesn't want to scare the children. He is staying calm so as not to scare the children."  How fortunate we are to have a President who thinks.

       urlLink National Review Online's Andrew Stuttaford  had some things to say about a  urlLink New York Times editorial  on the terror alerts. It was, as he said, "made up of cheap shots." Consider the following:     The president's credibility on national security issues was gravely wounded by the way he misled Americans, intentionally or not  , about the reasons for invading Iraq - including the suggestion that the war was part of the campaign against Al Qaeda.     Relying on my memory, I do not recall Bush suggesting that the war in Iraq was "part of the campaign against Al Qaeda." I recall him saying that the conflict in Iraq was part of the War on Terrorism, which extends beyond al Qaeda and beyond Iraq. This war we are waging is a war, as Bush promised, that will be carried to those terrorists who would do us harm and to those countries who, in any way, harbor or support those terrorists who would do us harm.

      The Missouri Marriage Amendment wins resoundingly in the Heartland. Seventy-two percent of those going to the polls, mostly Democrats, said, "Enough is enough!"  The  urlLink St. Louis Dispatch  notes that proponents of the gay marriage ban raised only $10,000, compared to $400,000 raised by their seemingly better-organized and obviously better-financed rivals. The anti-family, anti-marriage gay lobby out-raised their opponents 40 to 1! 40 to 1! Yet, they took a severe beating at the polls.   urlLink The Washington Times  , reporting on the Missouri Marriage Amendment, noted that in  urlLink Ohio  and  urlLink North Dakota  the pro-family activists collected enough signatures for the issue to be on the ballot this November. Ohio is a key state this year for Bush. Perhaps this issue will attract not only a heavy turnout of Republicans but a heavy turnout of pro-family Democrats who may, because of his outspoken, pro-family stance, cast their vote for Bush, giving our President the electoral votes vitally needed to ensure victory this Fall.

      Regarding the appearance of George W. at the Knights of Columbus, the following exchange took place a The Corner on National Review:   KERRY AND KoC [Matthew J. Franck] I've now heard two days' worth of NPR's Morning Edition reporting on Bush's speech in Dallas to the Knights of Columbus, and I've read newspaper accounts today in the NY Times, Washington Post, and Washington Times. NPR never mentioned Kerry at all in its reporting, and though two of the newspapers have Kerry spokesman Phil Singer pooh-poohing the warm reception Bush got from this Catholic group, nowhere have I seen or heard any story informing us whether Kerry was also invited to speak to the K of C. Does anyone know whether they invited him? Was he invited and refused? Was he snubbed? It just strikes me that Kerry's non-appearance before the K of C, whatever the reason, is at least as interesting as Bush's non-appearance before the NAACP. More so, since Kerry is nominally a Catholic and claims to be a faithful one. Shouldn't it strike reporters as, well, scandalous that he not speak to the Knights--whether the scandal stems from his refusal or from their non-invitation of him? Either way, the non-curiosity of the media about why he wasn't there too is notable in itself. Of course, had Kerry spoken, he would no doubt not have gotten the warm reception the Knights gave the Protestant Bush. Five will get you ten that knowing this is so is the reason reporters don't even want to ask the questions.       RE: KERRY AND KoC [  urlLink  KJL   ]Matt, a source at the KoC tells me: "The Knights of Columbus invites the President of the United States (and the heads of state of all the other countries where we have members, including Canada, Mexico and the Philippines) every year. Usually, they send a letter extending greetings and that's it. Sometimes, they accept the invitation. Reagan spoke in person at our 1982 convention, and Bush 41 spoke in person at our 1992 convention. We invite heads of state, not candidates for public office. If John Kerry wins in the fall, he'll get an invitation next year because he'll then be a head of state."

      Jenna Bush, daughter of President George and First Lady Laura Bush, was a little playful with the media the other day,  urlLink sticking out her tongue  at a photographer taking her picture during a campaign stop with her father in St. Louis. Her mother,  urlLink talking to her daughter about it later , suggested she work on her impulsivity. When Laura Bush was asked about offering similar advice to Teresa Heinz regarding the latter's recent comments, she said, "It's hard when your husband's running for president. It's hard to be scrutinized and to hear the criticisms, and I think that's really what the fact of the matter is in what she said."  What class!  Four more years!
