           I wish I was like a cool character in a really good book.  Like the ones who are 20 ( but smoke, but I have no intention to smoke) and who has a white teacup with blue designs on it, and who uses it to put cigarette ashes in it.  Someone cool like that.  I mean someone who is cool and carefree, and who has a really cool life.  Sophisticated, intelligent, and who can bake a killer cheesecake. I love the stuff.  And who doesn't want a car, or who doesn't care what she looks like... But looks great anyway.  And who gives and gives and gives, and doesn't care if she gets anything in return... Someone who doesn't have any relationship problems... Who... Who can look at a situation and know exactly what will be right to do. Ah.... Is it my inner self, my inner character?

           I have made a major mistake.  My constants a totally SCREWED up!  The boyfriend, the hobbies,  and my friggen knee. ( I had knee surgery). Anyway, things just keep getting farther and farther away.  Well, not my knee... Because If that was happening, I probably wouldn't be sitting here right now.  I just keep having these nightmares.  But not the kind that are sudden. The kind that are a continuation of what you were thinking about right before you went to bed.  Anyway, I had a horrible one about my boyfriend.  We were all grown up and stuff, and he kept getting farther and farther away, and it really freaked me out.  Well we had two kids, and I got the flu or something, and I was puking in the toilet... And they were just babies.. crying, And he wouldn't help me. He just said that it isn't his fault that I am sick..... Now that.... was scarry.  And a tad bit of reality....

        Girls were not given the fully reliable qualities in life.  It is very sad when all a girl can do is think.  Maybe too much, maybe way too much. Or maybe the girl is a TOTAL flop and can't decide what to think about. It is a rather saddening experience, let me assure you.  So you might have guessed what is wrong with me.  I'm thinking too much.  In fact, WAY TOOO MUCH. I mean, there are only a few things in life that are my constant, and I'm just not sure about them anymore. I suppose that maybe I can do something about it. Something to make me not to be such a shallow person.  But then again, does a shallow person care so much? I don't know.

        I want to know why everything has to be so complicated. Or rather.... why are guys such dicks.  Like Jared for example.... why does he have to act so nice yet be so..... mean.  Ya, I know... GREAT VERBS!!!!  But I guess it doesn't really matter about him. I mean, we're friends and all but. He totallllly doesn't ever... like.....hmmm.  He is just a jerk, that's all. Like with our book for example... he told me that he doesn't want to finish it with me.  Well, screw him. Ah!

          Ran into a mailbox on my bike today.  Have  bruise on my shoulder.  Is it my fault that the citicens of America can not find a good place to... place their belongings on the side of the road.  And surly they do not have to extend to bloody far out into my shoulder!  I have gotten hurt way too much this very summer.  I do not intend to have another part of my body surgically removed.  Ok, so my knee wasn't surgically removed, but. Um. Nevermind.    So, the whole friggen male population seems to think I want too much in life.  I'm not sure about what.  But I thought that I can make it clear to the males out the what I um, "want".  Hmm... Starting from well, now.    1.  I want,  need , to graduate school.   1- 1/2.  Get car. A really really really nice car.   2. I need to graduate from design school.   2- 1/2. Go to Europe with signiffagant other.    3. Move to a city.  Perferrably a big one.   4. Live in the city (with boyfriend/husband or whatever the connection) in a flat. (Perferrably one on the top floor)    4- 1/2.  Possibly and hopefully marry one whom I love and adore, and HOPEFULLY!!!!! ditto for him too.   5. Move to outskirts of city when have kids.( A girl? Named Julia Mae ...whatever?)   6. Not be a soccer mom.   7. Overall be sucessfull and die before I need someone to change my depends.
