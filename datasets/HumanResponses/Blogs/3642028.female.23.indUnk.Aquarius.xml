      Yeah!! i'm finally connected! WhooPppieEee...since i got back, it's been hard to get internet connection since i haven't go apply for any yet...thinking of getting a new pc first...but after intensive calculation n window shopping i've decided that i should stick to my old notebook first...n get internet connection first to save cost...sigh...  There was a blackout at my area lastnite...kinda fun..hehehehe...my first blackout! Whooppiiee doo again! hehehe! It was dark, hot, and i got bitten by mosqitoes...! Ughhh..i just hate those tiny blood suckers...Fortunately, at around 11.30pm i guess the power was back...at least i can go to sleep peacefully n not worrying bout the buzzing mosqitoes around my ears...  well, then...i think that will be all for now...gonna go get a job! im feeling bored staying at home already....ughh..n i really wanna get a new pc!! ugh...! wat i need right now is a cold shower n ice cream!

      Yeap, I had offered to extend my stay but mom said it's ok and not to worry too much...and her advice to me was "don't try to please everybody, do what u think is best" For a moment there, it got me thinking...i think that's the best advice my mom had ever given to me...now i feel better than this morning...much much better...at least my conscience is clear right now...Ahhh...and it feels great to see my baby again..miss him soo soo much...! Cant wait to show him the handphone pouches that i've personally hand stiched them for him...  Tomorrow im gonna meet my grandfather,  yam cha  with him, talk to him and really spend quality time with him... (: Tomorrow will be a GreAt DaY! PeAce OuT!

       Guilt  (glt)  n. : 1) The fact of being responsible for the commission of an offense.   2) Law. Culpability for a crime or lesser breach of regulations that carries a legal penalty.  3) Remorseful awareness of having done something wrong.  4) Self-reproach for supposed inadequacy or wrongdoing.  5) Guilty conduct; sin.   Number 1, 3 & 4 of the above, i think are the most suitably applicable to me.  That's how i feel when i woke up this morning...i'll be leaving Miri flying to Kuching tomorrow morning to visit my grandfather. Will be staying there for a night then flying back to Singapore on Tuesday morning...Mom had been hinting me to postpone my flight...and i took no notice of it..Dammit! She's gonna be so alone in the morning when i fly off tomorrow cos Dad is still in KL (called him this morning to wish him Happy Fathers' Day) n Sis coming back tomorrow afternoon...part of me wants to extend my stay and another part of me wanting so badly to go back to my life! Man, i feel very bad cos next Saturday will be my grandfather's birthday and i'm very close to him...now im thinking whether im worthy of his affection since i'll be missing his bday...Sigh...  I've been staying in Miri for more than a month now...n im feeling so restless, helpless n useless...no life back here at all...my gawd, i sound like im whining now...geezz..feel so "hanging"...i just feel like i wanna get my life back..i wanna go get a job again, make my own dicisions, have my own space...is that so wrong of me? Am i being selfish here? Hmmm...i don't feel so happy bout leaving here rite now...feel bad for mom...i know that she's gonna miss me alot...i bet im gonna get homesick as soon as i get back to S'pore...damn... why life has to be so complicated...  Note to myself : Decide what i'm gonna do next...

      Yay!! It's Saturday!! woke up early today (around 6.30am again...)with stomach cramps ...must be hungry...but the jabbing pain is on the left side of my stomach (ouch)Getting worried because i don't know if it's my appendix or not, hmmm...but that means i don't have to go to the office! YaY!! Heheehe...  After having a plate of " Bihoon " with pig intestine, liver and kidney (yummy) and a cup of Milo, the pain started to subside and i found out that the appendix is actually situated on the right side of your tummy, and not on the left side...silly me. So, that means i was dead hungry that causes me to wake up with stomach pains! Heheehee...Pheww...  Take Note : Better learn more on Appendix pain...   Appendix or Appendicitis Symptoms   What is your appendix and what is appendicitis?  Your appendix is a finger-like projection at the start of your large intestine and resides in the lower right side of your abdomen.  It has no real function as far as digestion goes.  Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix.   Appendix or appendicitis symptoms  1)pain in the abdominal area usually beginning in the navel area and radiating to the lower right side of the body.  2)fever  3)nausea and vomiting - usually only after the pain is felt - distinguishing appendicitis from gastroenteritis.  4)diarrhoea (in some patients), constipation in others.  5)increased frequency of urination or increased urge to urinate.

      I just cant get this song out of my head...i've watched the making of Somewhere I Belong video on MTV this afternoon...n the song has been haunting me...i went to check out the lyrics and i find it very meaningful....   Somewhere I Belong   (When this began) I had nothing to say And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me (I was confused) And I let it all out to find That I’m not the only person with these things in mind (Inside of me) But all that they can see the words revealed Is the only real thing that I’ve got left to feel (Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own  [Chorus] I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long (Erase all the pain till it’s gone) I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m close to something real I wanna find something I’ve wanted all along Somewhere I belong  And I’ve got nothing to say I can’t believe I didn’t fall right down on my face (I was confused) Looking everywhere only to find That it’s not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (So what am I) What do I have but negativity ’Cause I can’t justify the way, everyone is looking at me (Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own  [Repeat Chorus]  I will never know myself until I do this on my own And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed I will never be anything till I break away from me I will break away, I'll find myself today  [Repeat Chorus]  I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m somewhere I belong I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I’m somewhere I belong Somewhere I belong

      Think I had 3 hours of sleep today....(YaWnS)...slept at around 3am after chatting with the birthday boy...sigh...I miss him dearly...wish Im there to celebrate his birthday...  Went out with my mom to have breakfast together as usual n I felt horrible...After that, we're off to the airport to send my maid, Christina off to Labuan. While waiting for Christina to check into the departure hall I met my ex-primary school classmate, Satwan. I was pretty surprise cos he still recognized me! Found out that he's on his way to Sabah cos uni starts on this coming Monday (bummer)...I also found out that his lil brother, Jaswan is currently studying medicine at RUSSIA! Whoa wee!! That's interesting..! Heard from Satwan that the tuition fee there is very cheap...Oh well..I wish I could go to Russia...it would be fun..I guess...hhmmmm...  After breakfast I was feeling drowsy...I need to catch some Zzzzss argghh! I quickly switched on to MTV and hit the sofa once I've got home...MoMo was pawing on my arm wanting me to carry her...man, she stinks...So I decided to sacrifice my nap to bathe her... It took me almost 2 hours to wash her, dry her and comb her fur! I'm exhausted and smelled like a dog...Now it's my turn to take a bathe...  It's almost 2pm when I finally got to get some shut eyes...but then again, after a few minutes of turning and tossing I just couldn't sleep...and I could feel my head aches... must be the dreadful weather...it's do damn humid here....and im too lazy to get up to switch on the aircon...What a day! There are so much things going on in my head, I have to get a job but I haven't even started writing my cover letter, things to buy and I haven't had the chance to down to town since I got back to Miri, friends to meet but I'm just plain lazy to go 'yam cha'...haiz....bills to settle once I get home and wondering what's my baby going to do on his birthday...(dammit) I'm feeling guilty already...wish I could have done something, maybe surprise him with something...sending him cookies or a cake perhaps, perhaps, perhaps...haiz...I better stop thinking too much and go to SLEEP!! My upper right eyelid started to twitch again...it's been twitching since last nite when I was out to have coffee with Jason, Jane, Leanne and Shuk Jon who joined us latter at about 10.30pm after doing O.T. The poor girl...   It's 4.15pm when I woke up. Mom will be home soon! Have to clean the house...swept the floor and folded the clothes and wash my hair! It's been 2 days since I last washed my hair! hehehehhe! Lazy wat....and I'm supposed to meet Faizal for coffee later but I turned him down...U know why? Cos I'm L-A-Z-Y..! heheheee...  Went out to have dinner with my mom...just the 2 of us, dad is in KL for business trip and sis is in Bintulu for some promotion... We were supposed to have vegetarian food cos today is Vagetarian DaY! But at the end we decided to be vegetarian for half a day.. hehehe...We wanted to eat seafood! hehehe....My goodness, my right eye lids started to twitch again...arggghh!! It's making me go bonkerS!! arrrrggghhhhh!!  7pm got home to watch nane nane nane nane nananaaaa (Holland Village) heheheh! And my stupid eyelid just couldn't stop twitching! aaarrggh! I've received 2 missed calls from my dear baby!! YAY!! hehhehe...so happpyy.....

      Just got back from facial today! I finally permmed my lashes!  *Blink*BlinK*  Hehehe! Im so very hungry rite now because i skipped breakfast,. Therefore, i&nbsp;shall be short and sweet.   My facial appointment was at 10am, so woke up at 9am. Picked up my&nbsp;grandad from the   kopitiam   at 9.30am and then rushed all the way&nbsp;down to&nbsp;do my facial.&nbsp;My beautician, Helen, adviced me to change to water-based skin care products&nbsp;for my face because i have&nbsp;oily skin (previously i had combination of oily and dry skin..now&nbsp;its oily...sigh).&nbsp;&nbsp;Im thinking of switching from  Clinique  to  Biotherm ...hmmm gotta go check out the prices once i get back - another item added into my wish list! HEehehee... I&nbsp;felt   pampered   during my facial session with the massages, the relaxing music in the background, the dim lights and all. I even felt asleep   twice  !&nbsp;My session lasted for two and a half hours - including 20mins of permming my lashes.&nbsp; Hehehe... ok better stop now and go   EAT  ! Ciao!

      Had an ugly quarrel with Baby late last nite to 4am this morning. Sigh... Tried to sleep after that because i had to wake up early to send my Dad off to the airport, that means waking up at 6.45am. Had a bad headache from the lack of sleep and didnt have the mood to do pretty much anything. Told my Mom i wasnt feelling well to help out at the office, so i went home and sleep for the whole morning.   Woke up at around&nbsp;noon time and grabbed a quick bite, then&nbsp;went to the office to do some work. Kept checking my phone to see if i have any missed calls from Baby but found none. The argument, though abit fuzzy, kept replying in my head - i imagined what would happen if ... the same problem kept resurfacing ... hmmmm... But the more i think about last night, i began to wonder what's Baby's opinion on this matter... Something tells me that he still cares for me and i shouldn't feel inferior in our relationship - certain things should be kept forgotten.&nbsp;That is best, i hoped...   Tried to be optimistic and think positive thoughts like the happy times in our relationship.... Yes, i can say that im kinda&nbsp;lucky to have such relationship with my Baby. We did have our ups and downs but in the end, we just put our problems aside and just enjoy each other company. Hehehe...  Better dont think so much...gotta get ready to go out later.&nbsp;Chilling&nbsp;out with&nbsp;some friends, Gerald n gf and jason. Gerald will be coming to pick me up at round 9pm, so i better get ready and go change. NiteZ

      Today is our   2nd Anniversary  ! HoorRay!! Hehehe.. I was talking to my Baby on the phone yesterday&nbsp;at around 11pm plus (close to 12pm, i guess) when suddenly in the middle of your conversation, he just said "Happy Anniversary, Baby!!" Hehehee... And the truth is, i was totally caught off guard!!...there was&nbsp;a pause, then i was like "EEeeee u   remembered  !" Hahaha...its not that i've forgotten or anything, i just never realised it's past 12pm and its the 27th already...actually, the   exact time   he wished me was&nbsp;more like at   12.25pm   (yeap, i remember the exact time) Hehehehe.. i was pretty much  touched ...sigh...how i   miss   him now...I felt a little guilty because at that time, i was throwing little tantrums at him...hehehe...  "Thank you, Baby for coping with me for 2 years already! Muah! Love ya to bits!"    &nbsp; I fell in love all over again when i received a sms at 1.48pm, today, from him saying nice stuff to me (not going to reveal the contents of the sms here because im down right selfish now and i wanna keep it all to myself, HA!!)&nbsp;AAwwww....wished we could celebrate our annivesary today... Its&nbsp;a wonder how little things  do  make a&nbsp; huge  difference in ones feelings. You know   that   feeling, when&nbsp;u get all   tingling  &nbsp;all over your body,   that fuzzy wuzzy   feeling... Now, that, my friend, this feeling is called ' chemistry ' ...   Love   is in the   air  ...  Hehehee....I just cant help it but this song by Wet Wet Wet is killing me! Its like playing all over n over n over in my head! I just gotta type out the lyrics! Heehee...    *Love is All Around*       &nbsp;  I feel it in my fingers   I feel it in my toes   Love is all around me   And so the feeling grows    &nbsp;  It’s written on the wind   It’s everywhere I go, oh yes it is   So if you really love me   Come on and let it show    &nbsp;  You know I love you, I always will   My mind’s made up by the   way that I feel   there’s no beginning,   there’ll be no end   ‘cause on my love you can depend    &nbsp;  I see your face before me   as I lay on my bed   I kinda get to thinking   of all the things you said, oh yes I did   You gave your promise to me and I   gave mine to you   I need someone beside me   in everything I do, oh yes I do    &nbsp;  You know I love you, I always will,   my mind’s made up by the   way that I feel   there’s no beginning,   there’ll be no end   ‘cause on my love you can depend    &nbsp;  Got to keep it moving    &nbsp;  Oh It’s written in the wind   oh everywhere I go, yeah, oh well   so if you really love me, love me, love me   come on and let it show   come on and let it show   come on and let it   come on and let it (come and let it show, baby)   come on, come on, come on let it show baby   come on and let it show   come on and let it show, baby   come on and let it show    Aaaaaaahhhh....i feel    loved   .

      I seriously need a new hairdo! I have really thick and coarse hair - end of story. I have had quite a number of nick names&nbsp;during my school days, thanks to my hair. I've been called lion's mane, mushroom head, horse's tail, rabbit's tail, mop head, bush girl n lots more...all thanks to my hair. All i need is a freakin   change  !@&nbsp; Sigh...Im so used to having 2 hairdressers to&nbsp;blow my hair everytime i visit the salon. Im used with comments like "Whoa, u've have really thick hair! People will kill to have hair like yours" .... Thanks but no thanks. I hate my hair.   I REALLY NEED A NEW HAIR STYLE! HELP!     It's either i do it here in Miri - My mom's hairsytlist has been&nbsp;presistantly asked&nbsp;me to go to her salon while i still prefer&nbsp;letting my sis's hairstylist do the job. However, at S'pore, Baby has been persuading me to go to  REDS  at Suntect&nbsp;to do my hair cos he knows the manager but my mom's another hairstylist in&nbsp;S'pore manages  Hairitage &nbsp;at Millenia Walk, whom i really do trust the most cos he's really   that   good but damn expensive. For a freakin hair cut and a wash will set u back  S$100++ at Hairitage !! And&nbsp;all i want is to restyle my hair, colour it, and maybe straigthen it...now how much will that cost me, huh?! I dont think i can afford it, that's for sure. Sigh! Sianz! Dunno lar...maybe tomorrow i'll give my sis's hairstylist a call to make an appointment.   Still has no idea what hair&nbsp;style i want. Think i better browse through the magazines to get some ideas. Ciao and nite nite.&nbsp; Oh yeah, I might be getting my eyelashes permmed instead of having them extended because im just&nbsp;too lazy to put on my contacts. If i wear my glasses, my extended eyelashes will definately touch the lenses. So i better perm it instead. Am i vain or what? Well, at least i know that there are some people more vain than me, like&nbsp;my mom and sis. Heheehhe!

      Yeah man....i feel good...!!&nbsp;It always feels good when u help someone out! Though it's just recommending a site or giving a piece of advice, may it be small or huge but its nice to see them happy and&nbsp;content and appreciate your help. Its   good   to spread some   love   around... God knows the world needs a whole lot of   love  .   Watched   National Geography   yesterday, freaturing   Honour Killings  . It's really sad that cruelty and discrimination againts women still happen in some parts of the world.&nbsp;It's just isnt fair to treat another human being,&nbsp;especially women in particular, as&nbsp;worthless living&nbsp;beings. It's just sad to see your own flesh&nbsp;n blood - father, brothers, mother and husband holding&nbsp;u down and torching you up or beating&nbsp;u up just because u've disobeyed&nbsp;them. It's&nbsp;cruel to see another human being&nbsp;torturing another for the sake of punishment&nbsp;and worst of all,&nbsp;in the name of " Honour ".   Speaking&nbsp;of honour - what honour? Go look up in the dictionary and&nbsp;see for yourself&nbsp;the words use to define   Honour  . Tell me that the definations&nbsp;used&nbsp;to describe Honour are worthy of the actions done by these so-called-Honourable&nbsp;men to their wives and/or sisters. Tell me that these women deserve the beatings, the sufferings&nbsp;and insults being hauled at them&nbsp;for just being viewed as lowly worthless being slightly intelligent than animals. It is   absurd  ! I&nbsp;dont think&nbsp; the word Honour comes even close to describing&nbsp;muderers as honourable. They are after all are just&nbsp;murders technically, right?&nbsp;When one takes another human live is definately with no doubt what so ever is defined as a   muderer  . Eventhough they say that what they&nbsp;did&nbsp;was all&nbsp;in the name of Honour.   Bullshit!   I think these&nbsp;cowardice men are chauvinistic&nbsp;prick who only think between their legs.   Ugh! Men, i can really go on and on and spoil my fine mood. Dont get me wrong here, it's not that i   hate   men. It's just that it's unfair to the women whom are always looked upon as second class or weaklings in majority societies, 21st century or not - it's all the same. Discrimination and predilection against women are everywhere and its happening  24-7 ! Its just so unfair that we have to always prove ourselves in order to gain respect from men! Men! Ugh!  That does it...i better stop before i start pounding on my poor keyboard to death! Better go read or watch the telly. Need to think  happy thoughts ....    "Spread the   love   people!" --&nbsp; Peace OuT!

Popular was having a book sale and everything has to GO! I think i spent around RM170 on really good books! I've bought  Nadia's Song  and  Mosaic , both by Soheir Khashoggi,  Daugther   of Fortune  by Isabel Allende,  Wild Orchids  by Jude Deveraux and finally,  Heroine of the   Dessert  by Donya Al-Nahi. Muahahaha...there goes my trips to the library, wont be visiting it now&nbsp;since i've got my  own  *new*   books to read! Muahahhaha!!  Right now,  Soheir Khashoggi  is my   icon  ! Definately one of the best story&nbsp;writter on discrimination against&nbsp;women in the Middle East. After reading her bestseller,  Mirage , i was totally hooked on her books. She writes about the&nbsp;current&nbsp;situation on discrimination against&nbsp;abused&nbsp;women in the Middle East and also the&nbsp;forbidden love between man and women,&nbsp;the betrayal, the family's honour, the clash of cultures and traditions, the scandals&nbsp;behind it and the woman's struggle&nbsp;just to survive - truly heart warming and definately&nbsp;a page turner.   There are a few other titles that im looking for like the true story of the Legendary Princess of Thieves (can't remember what's her name)...bleh....but i know that&nbsp;Kinokuniya has the book but it's so   bloody   expensive!!. At the meantime, i can't wait to start reading on my new books but which one? Im&nbsp; having dilemma in choosing the first book to read now..hmmm...think i'll start off with Mosaic...the story sounds   more   interesting. Hehehe... Ok now...better stop cos i wanna go read... Nite Nite!

She picked me up from the airport and while driving she was furiously battering her newly extended eye lashes&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;me... *Show Off!* &nbsp;Hhhmmppfff... Cant wait to get mine extended as well!! hehehehe!  &nbsp;  Got home and at first my grandfather couldnt recognised me in the car. Hahaha! Once i hopped out of the car he was shocked! And nagged at my mom for not telling him sooner! Hahahaha! And as for my sweet MoMo, she was just as happy and all hyped up when she saw me! She even hopped out from the chair (which she never does cos she's affraid of heights) and ran to me with that cute lil face she made, an attempt to smile by barring her front teeth...simply adorable! I miss her sooo soo much! She practically followed me everywhere i went... hehehe...and hopping on&nbsp;her hind feet wanting me to carry her... hehehhe...from that i know she misses me alot too...im   so touched  .... (: Just love her! She's soooo soo  CuTe !!  &nbsp;  My sis is in Brunei and will be home after a few days..... Anyways, the grand fanale was (drum rolls) my dad! He still has no idea that i was back...so we waited for him to get&nbsp;home from his golf session at about 6pm... hahaha! I wished that i could have captured the look on his face when he saw me peeking out from the chair! He&nbsp;mistaken me for&nbsp;my sister and he was wondering why my sis hadnt gone up to Brunei.... hahahha! He was really shocked! And of cos he was also glad i was home... Then he complaint to my mom why he wasnt informed that i would be back today...&nbsp;hhehehhee!  &nbsp;  We had dinner at home then went out to my grandfather's favourite   kopitiam   to   yam cha   but ended up ordering a plate of   bihoon   with fried   ikan bilis   .   Heehehehe!!     &nbsp;  Well, that's&nbsp;all for now....im really really very tired..gonna call my Baby before going to sleep..miss him already....Sigh.....Good nite!&nbsp;  &nbsp;   'Another day, another chapter, that's what life is all about...' --- Precious Moments

        16 July 2004 (Friday)    I finally went to   Orhard  ! Sooo Happy!! Till i forgotten to bring my umbrella (cos it started to rain when i got on to the bus) and my watch! Argghh! I was   that   excited! Ooohh boy...  &nbsp;  First, i went down to MAS office to validate my air ticket. Then, my mom called to ask me to buy sausages (yes u heard me right,  sausages ... there are no more delicious and fresher&nbsp;sausages in Miri compared to S'pore) at Centrepoint. Initially i bought the chicken sausages, then i saw these juicy deliciously cooked pork sausages on display and i asked the aunty if i could try a slice of it. And u know what? I was the MosT flavourable juiciest tender pork sausage i've ever tasted! No joke! It was  that  good! So, i ended up buying the pork sausages too...  &nbsp;  Next stop was Takashimaya! Bought Evita hair clip for mom and then went to Shu Emura counter to buy eye liner refills but the sales girl who was busy&nbsp;  re  -applying her heavily made up&nbsp;face said that the next stock will be in next week without even turning her face from the mirror!&nbsp;How vain can she get! Eventhough, the makeup is free but you dont have to over do it! My gawd! I was affraid that if she ever smiles, her faundation is gonna crack! Bhhrrr.... I went to the food&nbsp; department after that...have to buy macadamian nuts! AND its not any macadamian nuts....its ' Abalone ' macadanian nuts....mmmm mmm mmm...nuthing tastes better than Abalone macadamian nuts...i bought 1kg of it and that costed me $48! Ouche ...&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;thought i should drop by Topshop on my way to the bus stop...Afterall, its in the way...browse around the place..saw a few beautifully loud people and patient bfs waiting on their gfs, gfs with their gfs...seemed like the place was packed with people..as usual...Anyways, i bought a pair of black and white&nbsp;pin stripped pants which set me back at&nbsp;$79. Its so perfectly cut that my butt looked   perky   and   small ...  hehehe...! Wanted to buy another white pair of slacks but it was too big n the smaller size were sold out! so sad...  &nbsp;  Called Baby too see hows the cleanning&nbsp;at&nbsp;the NTU Hostel. Supposed to join him and Lawrence, his roomate to clean up the place before they move in their stuff...But at the end i didnt make it to the hostel cos by the time i finish packing my stuff at home n went down to Boonlay Interchange to take a bus to the hostel, Baby said they have finished cleanning. So, ended up at Jurong Point while waiting for Baby to come over. It's been ages since i last stepped foot in Jurong Point! Its so damn crowded! Walk around for about 40minutes then managed to buy a pair of Reebok Running shoes for my sis. It was on offer...Yippe! Another good buy!  &nbsp;  Think i spent quite alot today... luckily didnt go down to Far East! Could haf spent even more... After a black pepper grilled salmon for&nbsp;dinner, we decided to catch King Arthur but we missed the time at GV&nbsp;Jurong Point. So we went all the way to Tiong Bahru&nbsp;to watch the movie. Caught the 9.25pm movie. The movieee....was errrrmmm.... ok.... so so only...All i know was&nbsp;both of us was freezzing our pants off at the cinema! We were in our t shirts n shorts and the blasted aircon was blowing away rite above us!&nbsp;We didnt enjoy the movie much....and try to think&nbsp;that i almost pastered Baby to have a movie marathon by catching the next movie, Sisters which starts at 12.10am... ehhehehe!!&nbsp;Oh oh i almost forgotten!! On my out&nbsp;from the cinema, i heard a *prruuiitt* sound...then a peculiar stench! Some guy had just released his killer bomb! I almost fainted...Ugghhh...some people....Sigh..  &nbsp;  We got the last train back home. Reached home past midnite...i was exhausted as usual...after a loong loong day....while Baby was quite hyper cos he drank Red Bull..hahha..the poor thing...so i went to bed first...&nbsp;

      Yeap, u read it rite! I got called up for a second interview by the company nearby my place! Quite happy about it....think im gonna go buy a nice working bag...hmmm.... hehehehheh!  Anyways, Im totally exhausted.....just finished helping Baby assembled the furniture....had lots of " upper body workout ". We managed to assemble the wall cabinet and the table. We had difficulty in mounting the cabinet onto the wall tho, Baby had to carry the really heavy cabinet while i hammered and screwed in the wall screws. It was pretty cool cos the study looks great rite now...*YawNs* Im too lazy to type in the details.. we've been drilling, hammering, wipping, vacuuming, screwing and sweating our guts out for the entire day....so im pretty much numb rite now...even brain dead...it takes me longer to do anything now....ok then...i gotta go get my beauty sleep...Zzzzzzz...

      Yeap! Just ask me where to find what in IKEA n i can tell u just like *snap fingers* that! I've got IKEA layout rite at the back of my hands! I spent the entire day at IKEA yesterday! Went there with my Baby at around 2.30pm. We felt like we were shopping for our new home so many beautiful furniture to buy!! But the truth was we were only supposed to look for a study table, some shelves and wall cabinets. Oh well, at IKEA, anything is possible...u are allowed to be in tune to your " creative " side...u are allowed to get carried away and are encoraged to daydream even... "Nothing bad ever happens at  IKEA ", that would what Audrey Hepburn's character in 'Breakfast at Tiffany' will say if she knew of IKEA..... Hahhhaaa.... Sigh...  We had dinner at IKEA restaurant. We ordered 6 pieces of chicken wings (which by the way, were delicious...) and Pouched Salmon (my fav)....There were lots of hungry shoppers dinning at the restaurant...All in all, the environment was ok lar. Can't describe much.*Burrpp*   "Attention shoppers, IKEA is about to close in 10 minutes. Kindly, take your purchases to the nearest counters. Thank you." That was when we knew we should rush to the counter n pay up! Baby spent around S$302, which entitles us to IKEA privilage card! Yeah!! heheheheh! That means we can have a reason to go there and shop till our lil heart is content! So happy!!  Today, we're gonna buy paint n get some paint brushes to paint the study room....and Baby is rushing me to go out now! So gotta stop here......Ciao!

      I woke up with a clear head and a blocked nose! Quickly went to the bathroom to blow every mucus out! Hahahaaa...At least its not that greenish now, compared to yesterday. YiPee! Washed my hair after 2 days since my last wash! HA! hehehe... Made a bowl of cereals with milk for breakfast and Passion Fruit tea. Did some reading in this Wonderful weather. AAaaahhhh...what a perfect morning!  In the afternoon, Baby n i went to Tiong Bahru Plaza to collect my new glasses! YAY! Yes, i've found myself the perfect pair of glasses within my budget! So happY! Finally! ehehhhhehee..!  After that, we went to IKEA to check out the furniture for Baby's new study room! There was a huge crowd at IKEA! "Nothing bad ever happens at IKEA" AAAaaahhhh.....i just love going there..! We look at a few tables, cabinets and chairs... We got an idea how's the layout of the study already, so now, what we need is the suitable and affortable furniture to get!  Can't stay long now, cos i'm at Baby's place to check out the study room again. If possible, we're thinking of getting the furniture by today. Baby, is busy clearing the stuff in the study room now, so that we can easily imagine the layout of the study n the placement of the furniture...Heehehe....feel kinda bad now cos im supposed to help him out clearing the room but instead, im hogging his PC to write my blog! hehehhehe!! ok ok ... better go off now! Later!

      I was really sick! Feeling woosieee and feverish! Woke up early, to go see the doctor because the clinic opened at 9am to 12pm (Half day only). So, no choice but to get up, brush my teeth and bathe. My right foot was aching because of the uncomfortable hills i wore for the whole day yesterday. And Firday was a hot day and i havent been drinking alot of water. Plus, i ate frenchfries for lunch and also had fried fish balls! I was definately asking for it!  After seeing the doc, I went down to Baby's place by cab bacause i've promised him that i will help put in decorating his study room. Once i reached there, i felt dreadful! I wanted to go home n sleep! I think i stayed for about an hour then i told baby that i really need to go home n cant accompany him to Ikea to check out the furniture...He sent me home and on the way home bought lunch from the nearby  kopitiam . I ate lunch, took my medicine and went to bed with a full stomach and a bad headache. I think i slept for a full 4 hours straight! Woke up just in time for my medicine. Then ate a bowl of cereals n milk n did some reading and fell asleep before midnite.

      Friday was a buzy day....i had to go to 3 interviews!! First interview was at 10am, second one was at 2pm and the last one was at 5pm! I cant remember much, but all i know was i was  damn  tired! And my feet ached!  My first interview scheduled at 10am was at Bukit Merah Central, it went pretty well eventhough my speech was abit slurred...had a stuffy nose on that morning...Now im just hoping a get shortlisted for the second interview....(cross my fingers!)  The second interview was at Woodlands! Luckily, the building was just about 5mins walk from the MRT! *PheeWww* The interviewer was kinda nice, so that means it went well too...just hoping they will call me next week for the second interview...If i get this job, i will be given a company car to drive!! How cool is that?! (So cross my fingers n toes!@!)  Finally, the last interview was nearby Bugis MRT...It was the funniest interview i ever had. Why? Well, it seemed that the company took Mandarin Laguage very seriously. Answer well underlined when i have to fill in this section of " Laguage Proficiency " section. This is how the section looked like:  ------------------------------------------------------------- English : Spoken (V.Good), Read and Write (V.Good)                 Malay   : Spoken (V.Good), Read and Write (V.good) Mandarin : Spoken (Fair), Read and Write (V.Poor) -------------------------------------------------------------  So, when the in terviewver saw this, they were kinda shocked! (You can tell by the expressions on their face....one of them even laughed!) So, try to imagine the embarrassement! Then one of them asked me in mandarin " Was it hard for you to write your name? ". I said " Errmm..Kind of...hehehe " What they don't know was that i totally do not know how to write my own name in chinese characters! While filling up the form, i secretly hid my IC under the table to copy stroke by stroke of my chinese name! Arghh! A total bummer! So at the end of the interview the interviewer said "Ok, I think that's about it, that we need to know...we will errmmm contact you next week if u're errrmm shortlisted...hehehe" n i was like "Hehehehhe...ok..hehehhehe..".  Hai......At the end of the day, i met up with Baby at Bugis, had dinner there and went home...   By the way, On Thursday Baby and I watched Mean Girls at Tiong Bahru. It was a great movie!! We really enjoyed ourselves... especially Baby! At frist, he was really sceptical when i asked him to accompany me to watch the movie. And he was like "who would pay S$7.50 to watch that kiddish movie?!" Well, trough out the movie, all i knew was that he was laughing out loud along with the crowd in the cinema! I rest my case. I totally recommend this movie! It's the best teenage movie i've ever watched!

      It's been raining since morning...Good weather to ZZzzzzz...But unfortunately, my body wont give me the luxury of sleeping for the entire morning. So, by 10am i was off the bed n feeling very energetic n hyped up, i've decided to vacuum my room and the entire apartment...Now i can say that the place it 98.8% dust free! Hehehehe....  After all that vacuuming, i thought of pampering myself by doin home made spa. So there i was, giving my hair a hydrating treament when this HUMONGOUS centipede crawled its way up from the hole!! It was so  disgusting  till it gave me goose pimples all over my body! I just have to KILL it! Though i wished that my dad or mom was around! They will know what to do, like all parents do! So there it was, happily crawling away in the bathroom... I ran out half naked, quickly grabed the Sheltox n blasted it away at the centipede! I even took a pic of it (dead, of cos) but i havent posted it yet cos it's just too disgusting!   Till now, by just thinking of it crawling, gives me goose pimples! Bhhrrrr... Try imagining it crawling on your very own skin with its sharp tiny lil claws clawing onto your skin................Bhhhrrrrrr....getting goose pimples again... yuck yuck yuck...... Ok ok i better stop here before my imagination runs wild again...let's not spoil this wonderful cool day... Peace OuT.

Arggh!  It's Wednesday (Ladys' Nite)...n im down with a bad flu...Arggh...At least tonite the Amazing Race 90 minutes special will be on TV. Hurray! That's something to look forward to now.   Feel like giving myself a treat. Thinking of getting a large sundae with hot chocolate, hazel nuts toppings and whipped cream! Yummy! ARrgggH! My blocked nose is killing me!!

      My back, shoulders n neck are aching...taken my medication already for my fever n flu...Gargled with salt water again n spitted out another disgusting red-greenish lump. My throat is getting better. I haven't been eating much because i had no appetite for anything...too lazy to cook but managed to boil barley beans. So, i drank the entire barley water n ate the barley beans. Feel like puking. *Bleah* Feeling abit  wooshy  now, must be the lack of sugar in my blood...gotta drink more water n fruit juice. Gotta get that vitamin C...  Above all this physical weakness that have over come my poor poor body...i've managed to send my resume to lots of potential companies that are either nearby my place or offer the job i wanted. Muahahha!! So happy... i also managed to sort out all my documents into files, do my laudry (talking about my laundry, i've completely forgotten to hang them!They're still in the washing machine! Arrggh!), cook barley and clean my room. HA! Im so proud of myself...Now, all i need to do is hang my laundry, go take a bath, take my novel n reeeelaaaxxx..... AAaaaahhhh... OveR n OuT.

      "Gargle with salt water" That's the first thing that came to mind when i opened my eyes early this morning. I dragged myself from bed into the kitchen, poured warm water into my cup n then added salt, gave it a stir n *Garrrrggllee Gerrrrr Gerrrr PUI* Then *Haarrkk Arrrkk Sniff sniff HArkkk PUI* OUT came this lump of flame, red n greenish in colour!! Hehehhe...after that i felt much much better n went to bed to Zzzzzz...  Woke up a 11am, my throat didnt really hurt as much as lastnite but i felt like puking because i can feel the flame building up at the back of my throat! Furthermore, my whole body felt funny...im just not myself today...felt like a 100 years older with mucus trickling down from my nose...gotta eat " clarinase " to kill my running nose..n gargle with more salt water n boil barley later....*Sigh* i want my mommy!! But then again, im a big gurl now n i can take care of myself. So, i better not tell her about my conditions n make her worry over the phone...no sirreee....no ma'am! *sniff*SniFf*  After blogging, im gonna make myself a nice brunch, sort out my papers n documents for the resume, read my novel n drink lots n lots of water n barley water....Pray i will get better by end of the day...

      I think im falling sick...having a bad sorethroat n my whole body aches...i just popped in 2 panadol n hope that with enough sleep, i will feel better tomorrow.  Just got back from IKEA *YiPee* I was with Baby n his Sec shoolmates, Alan with his wife n Derek chatting over dinner...Alan n his wife were moving into a new place of their own so they were looking for some furnitures at IKEA..so nice..! I like....! Hehehe..  Anyways, a quick run through of what Baby n i did today...It was pouring outside for the entire morning, so our plan to go jogging n swimming were cancelled. Once the rain stopped, which was at about 3pm, we were able to go out n have a quick brunch at the  kopitiam  near my block. We decided to go to the library at Westmall because Baby is wearing shorts n t-shirt. He felt that he is ' under dressed ' if we were to go to the library at Orchard. Hehehehe...look who's vain now...n he call me vain...*BleT*   Borrowed 3 books to keep me company when i'm bored of going thru the Recruitment papers or watching TV. At least it will help me keep my mind occupied n not think of something negative like why cant i get the perfect job!@ Ugh...Anyways, im kinda happy because i finally managed to get a book by Julie Garwood that i've never read before... hehehe...it's called  KillJoy ...can't wait to start reading it. The other 2 were a book on Maltese so i can learn more about my lil MoMo n a Java Scrip Bible to refresh my memories...shows that how *BoRed* i am...*SigH*  Argh! Getting a headache now...better go sleep....pray that i feel better tomorrow..if not, then i better go see a doctor...sianz...

So gonna wake him up for a swim or a jog...but the weather today is soooo good for window shopping...But then again....i need to kill the extra kilos from last weekends. Sians....I hate the craving for sweet n salty food...i hate the mood swings...i hate the bloatedness...I just hate P-M-S. Im counting down the days to my next period...

      Yesterday, Baby wasnt feeling well. I think he ate too much till fall sick! haha! Ooppss...the poor baby...guess he didnt drink enough water after consuming all that MSG from the wedding dinner. So he went home to rest and we cancelled our plans to go down to Far East Shopping centre to check out the happening kiddies there.   Nevertheless, Sunday afternoon was an enjoyable day! Went out with Patricea to Quensway Shopping Centre because she wanted to get a pair of gym shoes and sports bra. It's been ages since i've stepped into Queenway where u can get the cheapest sports wear in S'pore (i guess). After hours (3 hours i think) of walking around n trying shoes, bags n clothes, Patricea managed to get a pair of gym shoes, 2 pairs of Nike socks, a pair of Adidas sports bra n a cool funky green blouse... Hehehe.. As for me, i got myself a corn in cup...my fav. *yuMMy* I'm on a tight budget cos i didnt want to spend money on unnecessary stuff. Im so proud of myself! *Smilies* It's time for dinner. We dropped by Anchorpoint Foodcourt n i had my favourite! PENANG LAKSA!! Hehehehee....   Our next stop for another 3 hours was IKEA! "Nothing bad ever happens in Tiffany" Quoted by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast in Tiffany) It's just how we felf at IKEA! I just love the place! I can browse for hours n hours n hours at IKEA...hehhehe.. We had so much fun there! Patricea gotten herself a new wardrobe, 2 rugs and 4 storage boxes. I bought a side table n 1 metre of fabric to match my room. Im making a cupboard project since i've got all the time in the world before i land myself a job...After the IKEA trip, i was supposed to meet Baby at his place to help him organise his cupboard, but it was late n i wanted to catch Message in the Bottle on TV. So Patricea n i went home. Oh yeah, before getting a cabby home, we had IKEA affortable Hotdogs! Just $1.70 for a hotdog + soft drinks! Muahahahaa..!  Reached home at around 9pm. I headed straight for the sofa. Once my butt touched the sofa, every single bone n muscle in my legs ache. I was exhauted! Seriously. I just sat there for an hour not moving...when it's 10pm the movie started airing on tv... hehehe...just nice...After a few minutes into the movie, Patricea n i were having this particular craving.....chicken wings...*drrrooolsss* Hehehe..yeah im guilty! im guilty for influencing her my craving for chicken wings...hahahha...so at the next advertisement, i took $4 rushed all the way down to the nearest kopitiam, went to the Muslim store.."Aunty four chicken wings!" Muahahhaaa!   Smell the aroma, taste the tender meat n the crispy skin, feel the juice trickling down your fingers...Aaahhh...that's the feel of " Perfection " Finally, I'm  content ...  "Perfection consists not in doing extraordinary things, but in doing ordinary things extraordinarily well."  --- Angelique Arnauld

      Aaaaahhhh....i feel bloated! Must be my PMS... Waiting for Baby to come back from his friend's wedding dinner at  The Regent Hotel...uuuu...Baby came back slightly after midnite and he said that the 8 course dinner was delicious. I need to get out of the house for a breather. Been staying at home for the entire day! Nope, i did not go to Orchard cos at the last minute i didnt feel like going out.  Wanted to go to 7 Eleven to buy some snacks. But then again I just have this craving for chicken wings!! I know it's past midnite but i just cant get the craving out of my head! I NEED my chicken wings!! So Baby n i went out to the  kopitiam  (at Holland V) to try out the chicken wings there...but when we reached there the shop is close. *BlaH* So disappointed! Why open a shop past midnite when all the food stalls are closed! So ridiculars! We did not give up after making that disapointing trip. We then went to the  kopitiam  near my block cos we knew that the Muslim shop closes at around 2am and they sell delicious BBQ chicken wings. Once there, we saw the aunty packing up. Two shots straight to the heart! *Ugh* Then in the end we headed up to 7 Eleven. Cant decide what to eat. So end up buying Myoyo Tom Yam Noodle in Cup and a carton of Fruitree Apple n Aloe Vera juice. *Blah*  Went home watched Volcano High VCD while eating my Noodle in cup and Baby pigging out on IceCream. Halfway thru the movie i felt sleepy n so does baby...i think i felt asleep on the sofa till Baby have to wake me up n drag me to bed...ZZzzzzzzzzz...

      I woke up at exactly 4.30am today...Dont know why...my eyelids just sprang open and have no intentions in shutting my red swollen eye balls! Argh.....Finally, at around 6am i am able to get some sleep...feeling so stressed out with nothing to do....  Haiyaaa..another day of job hunting. Woke up at 12pm...Yesterday my interview with the company far far away went really well...but one  tiny  problem...they offered me a pretty low salary...but it was much higher than my previous salary but low for the position im applying for...i felt offended cos they have under estimated me...thinking that i didnt do my research on the market salary for that position....sianz.... So, at around 1.35pm i called the HR manager up and rejected their offer. She sounded kinda shocked n wanted to know my reasons for rejecting...i said that the salary was kinda low for that particular position n i said thanks for the offer but no thanks. *SiGh* Now, im secretly hoping that she has realised that she has made a mistake and calls me back to negotiate on the salary...(cross my fingers n toes)  At the meantime, is hit the road Jack, i meant hit the recruitment papers Jack...hehehe.. Lame joke... Gosh, what am i going to do today?? Waiting for my baby to buy rojak for me and then wat? HHhhmmmm....maybe go to the library to get some books. Then walk around Orchard or something...hmmm...that would be good....get to look at the young and the beautiful people strolling along Orchard road...yeah...that would be " interesting " God, i need to shop! i really need to get myself something nice! ARggh! OveR n OuT.

      I just got back from an interview nearby my place...(very near...as in i can reach the company within 15minutes of bus ride or 7minutes in a cabby) but fortunately, it sux! i dont think it went well anyway...i'm kinda reliefed cos when i reached there, it just reminded me of my old workplace...maybe even worst...brrrhhrr...just gives me the chills... so weird... i cant imagine myself working in that kind of environment...so stressss....  Minutes later, i got a job offer from another company far far away....it will take me about an hour to reach there (by bus AND MRT, so its really far far away...) But im kinda happy...tee hee hee..Just imagine that i only started sending out my resumes to 4 companies on the 30th June and ive got shortlisted for an interview with 2 out of 4 companies so fast...Whoopee!! What a morale booster!! So later im going down for a second interview to discuss my job scope n salary... hehehe..wish me luck! Hopefully i get paid well...tee hee hee...

      Went to Sim Lim late this morning with Baby to buy his keyboard. At about 12pm Baby and i had a   HuGe  bowl of Katong Laksa  right outside of OG. After that, we walk around Sim Lim to hunt for the best deal we could grab for keyboard and mouse set. Baby managed to snag a very very very good deal where he gotten a  50% discount  from the already  discounted  price!! Hehehhee!! Both of us was practically gloating all the way from Sim Lim to Ikea!! Where on earth can you get  $13  for a A4Tech multimedia keyboard and optical mouse set?!? HEhehehhe!  And yes, we went to  IKEA  again! This time Baby wanted to a standing light for his hostel because the place was really dark, therefore, he needed something to brighten up the place. When i stepped into Ikea, the very  first  thing that came to my mind was  Ikea's juicy   chicken wings ! Muahahhaha!! The time was around 3pm and my stomach was still   full   from the Laksa! But i just cant resist the chicken wings! I kinda   shocked   Baby when i told him that i wanted to eat chicken wings! Hehehhe! So, we ended up at the Ikea's restaurant eating 2 pieces  of chicken wings  and a plate of  Today's Special, Mee Goreng ! Muahahha! We were totally stuffed after our delicious meal! And i actually left     sleepy   after that.  Baby sent me home after buying the standing lamp light. He stayed for awhile at my place to help me and Patricea to removed the old oven. It was a damn heavy oven! I was sweating like a  pig  after moving the darn thing out and down   2 filghts of stairs  !! After that, Baby had to go back to his hostel and i had to fix the shelves and clean the apartment - i was trying to burn some extra calories from the 2 fattening meals i had... Hehehhe!  When everything was in order and squeaky clean, i left like eating  ice cream !!! I have a box of  Vanilla  and a box of  Chocolate ice cream ! ARRGGHH!! And it was around 6pm! ARGGHH! I tried to   fight   the cravings by bathing and washing my hair! After all that cleaning and moping, i was really in need of a  good  scrubing and washing! But all that didnt do any good. So i opted for a   healthier   choice, a slice of  lapis cake  and one  whole guava ! And you know what? I had just finished my guava while blogging!! HAHAHA! ARGGH! Oh no! I feel like eating something again!! Think i better drink more water! At least it will contribute   ZERO   calories to my ever increasing body calories intake! Ciao!

I had a kinda cool feeling when going to  NTU  - like im going to school again...so nice... AAhh....My time will come  soon  enough... I havent made any decisions yet - if i should go to  NTU  or  SMU ...hmm... still have the entire year to figure it out!  Anyways, as i was feeling bored n restless because i have the sudden craving for   kopi peng   (aised coffee) in the middle of the night!! Hehehehe... So, i was like a walking Zombie at home...really restless... Then, i decided to browse on some  tatoo designs  on the net. I can say that saw quite alot of weird, scarry,   interesting  tatoos  on various   interesting parts   of the body... Hehehheh ... and some really neat ones. Posted a few here, which i think are the  simpler  ones, that i thought of sharing with u people... So, enjoy!Ciao!

      Yes...  de ja vu   with a twist, of cos. That was what i was experiencing today. Felt like i was single again - going out in the weekend all  by myself , doing things all  by myself , as planned. Aahhh...so weird i left. And here's the story...  Had a quarrel with Baby today! We were supposed to get up early this morning to run some errands - i was to go to the temple and Baby to buy his keyboard and mouse at  Sim Lim . But before i continue on with the story, this morning i was supposed to meet a friend,  Zhenquan  whom i havent met for a very very long time. We have so much to catch up! Our plan was to have breakfast and chill out till 2pm, when, he had to meet   someone   (i presumed is a   girl  ... hehehhhe) and i was to catch a movie and then register my library premium membership. Anyways, last night, Baby said he wanted to go to  Sim Lim  to get his keyboard and mouse and asked me to acompany him. So, wanting to spend time with him, i've agreed to postpone my meeting with  Zhenquan  at the last minute! And in the end what i got was a quarrel with Baby! UUGGHh!! Guys! Well, it wasnt a quarrel actually, more like a   disagreement   and i was really very mad with him!!!  After all i've done! Like i said we were    supposed    to wake up early to do our things and Baby was also   supposed   to help me to remove the old oven out from my apartment. I really hate it when things didnt fall according to plan. We were to wake up at around  11.15am . I was, on the other hand, was waaay awake by  9am ! Baby was still deep in  LaLa Land  then and only woke up after freakin  12pm !! He even had the nerve to get angry and said  "Well, im not going out then!"  ARGGHHH!! That was   IT  ! That sentence had really gotten me to my  boiling point ! I just completely ignore him then. I was so angry till i wanted to cry! But i managed to control my anger, sucked in my tears and prepaired to enjoy myself!  I went to watch  The Village  (finally...) I was quite surprised to see many single people in the cinema... like me, i really love going to the cinema alone! No obligations and i get to have the huge popcorn combo all to   myself  !! Muahahha... tho i didnt order it because i was still full from my cereals with milk i had this morning and i wanted to save some money. Hehehe. I lose myself into the movie. I really did enjoy the1 hour and 48 minutes movie, thought it wasnt as scary as i anparticipated. Its more like a  love story  with a   twist  , i guess...  "The things people do   to protect their love ones from any harm and the consenquences they suffer from their action in   doing so" . Yes, i think that pretty much described the entire movie. Hehehe...  After the movie, i was feeling better than i had this morning...more   in control  . My next stop was at the  Esplanade . Once at  City Link , i realised that it's been months since i last walked at City Link. Hehehhee...nothing much has changed, its still the same. i took the underpass to Esplanade, lost of people were stoping in front of the exhibits and actually appreciating them. That's a change. The few pieces on dislay were quite entriging.  Note to myself : Should try to spend more time at the Eaplanade.   On my way to the library i bought 2 pieces of  strawberries dipped in chocolate  - my fav. Quite expensive, though. For one small piece costed $1 each and the bigger strawberry costed $2 per piece!! Of course with my tight budget, i bought the 2 smaller ones which set me back $2! Haiyaa...it was worth it lar...have to enjoy life! Hehehe...  There were lots of people flocking into the library especially the  DVDs section . I registered my  premium membership  which set me back another $21 and also paid for my overdued book another $1.80. (Sigh, kept telling myself it's worth it) The membership will last for a year. Thats good because i have the privilage to borrow 4 books plus, another additional 4 items, may it be books, CDs, DVDs, or VCDs. Not bad for $21 worth of money. I borrowed 4 DVDs of movies i've missed. They are  Pay It Forward ,  Audrey Hepburn Story ,  Paris When It Sizzles  and  Amilie .  After having done all this, it was close to 6pm.   Dinner time  . I was  dead hungry  in the bus on my way home. I only had a mere cup of cereals with milk and 2 tiny pieces of strawberries dipped in chocolate for the whole day! Whoa! So i definately need to treat myself again for completing my errands as planned - Mission Acomplished! Call me a freak, i dont care! HAhaha! All i wanted was my   BBQ Chicken WINGS  !! Yeah!! *DrooLs*DrooLs* Hahaha! Ended up buying  4 pieces  of BBQ chicken wings and coeslaw which again set me back another $6!! Argghh!! Tomorrow plan is to go out to the temple in the morning, buy my shampoo and staying at home for the whole day to do some long-negleted house chores!! Hehehehhe!!  Baby called just now and trying to be funny... hmmm... I was trying to stay mad at him but it was kinda hard to stay that way for long and i knew it! Must work on it next time! So, wont let him take my feeling for granted!! Okie now...My stomach is bloated and it's that time of the month again!  PMS !! Now it explains alot on my  rollercoster mood swings ! Another week to go and my  "bestest friend"  will be here! Arrgghh! Better start controlling my cravings!! Chicken wings...potato chips...ice creams...chocolates....Arrrrrggghhh......

Best of all, they costed me  $19.90 !! Whoo hoo! There i go spending my 1 week lunch money to a pair of shoes! Uggh! Now i really have to be stingy when ordering lunch! Hehehehe...I can't spend more than $3 on a meal! Well look on the bright side, I can take this chance to lost weight! I know its unhealhty but as long im getting positive results, then who cares!!! Aalll i wanna do is have some fun - Chery Crow's song playing in my head... Hahaha..!  I getting very lazy now....
