      it's been abt 3 mths since i turned 17... "why doesn't it seem as special, or even more, than when i turned 16?" i ask myself this often. haha! oh, the sweet age of sixteen... i miss those young innocent days, filled with high-hoped dreams. have i lost my innocence then? just the other day, i was walking thru the park back home when i realised, i was growing up... i was actually growing up. leaving behind the girlish fantasies and quickly entering the world of womanhood. sometimes, thinking of it gives me a kind of pleasure; and then the more i think of it, it scares me. time is a curse...  i remember my 16th birthday. i remember it well. i think i layed plans for tt day my whole life! when clara and i were still best of friends, so long ago, i told her,"when i turn 16, i wanna fall in love and maybe have my first boyfriend! such a romantic age..." of course b4 all tt, there was henry. for 4 yrs i pledged my heart to him. and then one day i woke up to find it was all a dream. just a passing in the wind. it's almost funny now, how the young heart can have so much passion! and yet no wisdom at all...  the funny thing is... tt's when it all began. yasitha. tt was his name. he was from my church but i met him at my aunt's place... somewhere close to christmas last yr. i remember, my brother introduced him to me. he stuck out his hand to me as i told him my name. and he didn't let go for a full minute. 'til i became quite flushed and stared at my hand in his. and my sister and cousin didn't help one bit either! wat with all the giggling and the whispering... it was my sister who pointed out to me tt every time he spoke to me, he would tug on his shirt like a shy boy... and all this coming from a 21 yr old! it must have been a sight to behold... but it didn't last. sadly.  he wrote me a letter, thru my bro, saying tt he wasn't ready for such committments and tt i was too young for him... tt we could still be frenz but i shouldn't make it so obvious tt i like him... ttlast line was hilarious i tell u. the only words i ever managed to get past him were, 'hi' and 'hello'... i was upset, but i didn't bother wasting any tears on him... imagine, a 21 yr old, acting tt childish. besides' no one ever stopped to think tt he was too old for me!  there were a few others. i mean, i have this funny aura ard me tt sends across a msg tt 'if u touch me, i will break like shattered glass!' but there was tt occasional 1 or 2 who saw thru tt cover. one of them was this 19 yr old from M.I... during my 1st 3 mths there, on valentine's day, he got his friend to ask me for my no. haha! wat a day... he was from the schl's soccer team and he was damn gd looking! but as it happ, i didn't give him my no, and neither did he pursue it. sometimes i wonder if should've given it to him. sometimes. the other times, i'm glad tt i didn't. cos i wouldn't have met him.  oh. haha! i forgot to tell u who he is. only the very guy who i fell in love with. it's funny though, i wanted to fall in love with someone when i turned 16. and i did. the day b4 my 17th birthday, i met siva. i guess, dreams do come true!
