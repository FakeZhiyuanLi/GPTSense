      I was chatting with a friend of mine and the topic of SPM came out. I was telling her about the pressure I feel to face the exam on 4th december when she suddenly slap my hand! "4th december??? are u crazy or what?" that's what she said. and guess what... then I realized that the exam is not on 4th december ... but it's on 4th november!!!! how could I forgot the real date??I must be crazy.. it's an important exam. She laughed histerically ( so histerically that I hope she's not my friend at that time... ppl starred at us that's why) she said that she  just couldn't accept me being that ignorant on the date... hmmm.. this thursday I'll be sitting for history. GOD, give me strength.. I HATE history!!  okay.. I need to continue my study (history... arggghh!!)

      been a few days with no new entry. I guess I'm feeling different today so I decided to write. Okay... my TRIAL SPM exam will start this thursday and I'm NOT finish studying yet! 2004 is a tiring year for me. test, test, test,test,test, test and the real exam. I'm feeling nervous now. Start this thursday, and a week break start from saturday and then the exam will continue after that, is it tiring? of course it is! The trial will end on 17th Sept. and then I'll be facing the real SPM exam in november. ah wait... not november...my subject start on 4th december to be exact. but my friends who takes extra subjects will start earlier than me and that will be in november. Remember, 4th December 2004 will be my suffering day!! *broken*  I'm buying V6 concerts from a seller from singapore. Before, I think I've been ripped off, that she don't reply my 5 e-mails. And guess what,at last she replied! *wink* apologizing for replying a bit late and told me that she's going to give me a gift bcos of that.. woot :hehe: couldn't wait for it to arrive. I wonder how's the arashi poster that I sent to Liss is 'doing' . I posted that one the same day I posted the payment to the V6 seller.. oh wait she is in S'pore while liss is in Canada.. it takes time, I know :broken again: .I hope it'll be safely receive by liss *finger cross*

      I don't know what's getting in teenagers nowadays. It's really sad. And they're from a boarding school, and they're not that stupid to do something like this. If not much, they still have brains!     On March 28, a Form Four student of a school in Ampangan was found lying motienless in the dormitory. He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival.     The boy has been beated, kicked - causing his death only because of a small things. I really pity his parents. My parents want my lil brother to go to a boarding school since he is so lazy and get bad results. But I don't want him to go there since I don't really trust boarding school after many cases of gangsterisme that happened in boarding school. I don't want my brother to be the next Farid. A kettle is the price of his life. Okay... the eight boys don't wish to kill him, I can accept that. But they shouldn't do that to their junior... it's so cruel!! However I do pity them, growing up with this memory of killing someone is sure hurtful. If a real murder, they won't feel anything. But it's not the same with this eight boys. They kicked and beated Farid without a wish of killing him... but ... he.. d.i.e.d. They never wished to be a killer but now they ARE killers. And they can't do anything about it now that he's dead. Before doing something, try to think of the consequences.  Their age saved them however. Here is the stinging words from the judge for the students.  "ikut nafsu,lesu;ikut rasa binasa (english- u reap what u sow), In Islam, at this age, u are considered an akil baligh(adults) who know the do's and the don'ts. However on the civil law, u're still underaged, and therefore u can't be sentenced to death. Your age has saved u and u are very fortunate. Think about what u've done and repent. Hopefully, this will serve as a lesson to all of u."   The eight boys who had just been convicted of murder were being led to the police lock-up when their paths crossed with Farid's father. A few of them looked at him and said, " we're sorry, uncle". He could only offer a stony stare. He loves his son very much. They are like friends and very fond of each other... so we can imagine how is his feeling losing someone he loves.  I hope that this will not serve a lesson only to the students involved but also to other students outside there so they won't be doing the same things. I hope this will not happen again.   On a side note, I'm feeling better now. I love u panadols.. muah.. thankie

      Mood:    Yesterday, I went to the National Library.. of course with my sis, who is a year younger than me.My parents is so overprotective that it's hard for me to go out. I'm 17 yrs old! Okay... because my sis agree to go there with me, that's why I ended at the library  I ask u guys, if we are in a library, what should we do??? Pick the books and read in peace! I went to the library to study because I knew if I was stucked at home, I won't be studying at all: u know there are TV and COMP .. a wise person will choose both insted of studying and I'm a wise person!  and besides, my house can be very noisy with the existence of two naughty boys.. yups, my younger brothers.  So I was there expecting to read in peace, P.E.A.C.E . There was a couple of Lovebirds sitting at a table in front of ours. The girl is qute beautiful but the guy is so  ... (what should I call it? YUCKY perhaps). Did they knew this is a library and they should shut their mouth?? I was trying to study.. but I can't since their voice is all over my ears!!! 'nak bercinta pegi la tpt lain woi!' I wish I could say that. I decided to stare at him ( we were opposite each other ) and I do think that he realize my sharp eyes but he did nothing with it... still talking with the girl. OH.. PLEASE DON"T MAKE ME BURST INTO ANGER.. that sentence kept flying in my oh-so-full-with-anger mind.   And it cotinued until they were gone from the library. Yeah, I don't do anything  I just let it be... I think I need help on this. Counseling or something to build up my courage. My sis tried to calm me down at that time although I know she herself was having a burning heart.     I love u sis

I was eating when the phone suddenly ringing. I left my food and went to get the phone. And there's nobody on the other line.And then it rang again.. and there was a guy voice. The conversation is something like this  fool: er..er..er ( what's with this er..er??) can I speak to Faizal? me: Faizal? who? sorry, there's no faizal here. Wrong number. fool: so whose house is this? me: whose house? who are u? fool: Erm... what's your name? me: which school are u from? fool: Which school? I'm asking your name. me: I've no name. I won't give my name to ppl I don't know. fool: Ermm.. can I know u? me: What? u said u want to speak to faizal? Why don't u call him? fool: Now that I've dialed a wrong number, I don't think it's wrong for me to befriend with u. ( He's annoying!! From here.. I've known that this is a prank.. I don't think he dialed a wrong number... stupid reason wanted to speak with oh-so-called faizal) me: I got to go now. My father don't like me talking with stranger. fool: I called u later.I hope....... (I hanged up)  I tried to speak with a nice tone with this guy but I was sure annoyed by him. don't u think he is a fool.. at first wanting to speak with faizal.. and then want to befriend... he makes himself looks so stupid   hmmm...this guy has no life

Guess I'll learn to design a nice layout after my independence day ( yup... that's when my real SPM exam ended ) so for now, I'll just use this simple layout... better simple that none at all:D
