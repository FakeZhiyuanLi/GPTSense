      Ya know what, my job is not to make people fell alll warm and fuzzy about their products, my job is tell you to deal with it yourself crybaby and move on with life!  Later... Let me clarify here. I think the publics perception of customer service is severly warped. There are legitimate complaints that a company needs to discuss and resolve with a customer. Then unfortuneately there are a large population of idiots who are too dumb to find their ass in the dark with both hands and a flashlight.  There are also a large number of people who want a whole lot of something for nothing. Then you have those that really deseve something but because the afore mentioned people have exhausted the system and the company's services those services are no longer being offered.  Is this just in my company? NO!This is nationwide people from mom and pops places to corporate america. Here's a bit of truth, we all think at one time or another were entitled to something more for whatever reason, well guess what ? Regardless of whether you, I, or whoever feels they are entitled to more doesn't mean  you're always gonna get  it. Honestly sometimes I take perverse pleasure in shutting these people down cold. There is some joy in customer service after all.

      4 people in the last hour hr asked to speak to my supervisor. Interesting!! I think there's something to this... I may track how many people say they are going to write a letter in after talking to me too.  Later....... Upto 7 now requesting my supervisor and 6 people writing a letter!

      I am going to count how many times today a customer says " I want to talk to your supervisor!". Keep in mind here people this is after they have already talked with two different levels of customer service representatives and they got to me by requesting the highest avail supervisor. Hello dumb ass if you requested the highest available supervisor then I am it and you won't be transferred any further. Heres a news flash for all you would be ladder climbers. Where I work, I am the top rung and those above me don't give a flying hoot about your complaint and arent going to do didley squat  more for you than what I've already told you. MUAHAHAHAHAHAH...........ahhh the power............kind of corrupting yet satisfying! Like David Spade in that commercial where he's the phone operator saying "no, NO, nO, No, oh let me check with my supervisor.............NO! Hahahahaha!

At one time I had my own blog on my own site and all tricked out to my hearts little delight but honestly it took much too long to keep up so I quit.
