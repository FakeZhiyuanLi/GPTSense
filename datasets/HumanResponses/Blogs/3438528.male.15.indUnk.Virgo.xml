      Today has completly sucked! I had an English exam in the morning that was 1hr and 45 mins long and i think that i did ok. When i got out of the exam i meet all ma friends out the front of the skewl and waited for ash who we l8r realised was not at skewl. Chiraag said that he did the test wrong and every1 laffed at him, but i did not and i was the only one that shew ne concern towards the problem. L8r when i was having a good chat with chiraag on da net he suddenly started shouting at me for no reason and said that i was a bad friend and a load of other shit. I then threw my fone across the room after going offline, it is now broken and i cnt contact robyn :(. I then went back online and gave chiraag some shit bck cos i was so mad, i said that he had "fucked up the last 2 yrs of ma life" which is total crap cos i know tht i cldnt survive with ppl like him around me. I am now rly scared cos i dnt think i can get him bck and he has bloked me :(.i am now crien cos i wnt 2 b friends with him cos i love him 2 bits as a friend. I am now derpresed and pissed of with maself cos i must have done something to make him angry but i cnt think of wat it was, aand i rly wanna say sorry :(. so CHIRAAG I AM REALLY SORRY ABOUT EARLIER I WANT YOU BACK AS A FRIEND :D

L8r a couple of other friends came around and we ate some food. Raju then had to go and so Ash and Chiraag went to school with him while i read the Parcel.      When i opened I saw redness he he and it was all soft. I pulled it out and it was this really cool cushion in the shape of a heart :D I then read the letter and it was really sweet and it mad me c a bit, there was also a really kewl little book wit things that cheered me up in. Ma friends then arrived bck and we played 4 a little longer and then they went homzies. I am now chattin to ma Sexy gf on da net and havin fun ;)

      WOOOOOOOO, i have decided to bring back my blog due to popular demand by my friends, he he he, so here it is. Well 2day was the first day of study leave at school (i am currently doing my GCSE's), yea this means that I am supposed to use this time well to study in..... ur havin a laff aint ya, if there is sun i am gna b there, if i am able to be with my girlfriend i will be there. Oh yea by the way, whilst i have been away, i got a girlfriend and i love her very much, the only problem is that we live 150 miles apart :-(.    Today was also my first exam, it was spanish listening and i found it quite easy, it was foundation so i think that i have probably got around a C on it so YAY!! The exam lasted for half an hour and that is all i had to go to school for, however i stayed to keep my good friend Mr Ashley Nibloe company whilst he finished his ict coursework.   Wen i got home the sun was out so i thought that I would go and bathe outside, just as i had finsihed putting on some sun cream the bloody sun went in and it has been cloudy since. However you can thank the clouds for my blog being back because other wise I would have been outside lol. Well that all I got for now so i will give u some more info 2moz, c'yall l8r, peace out, love ya all xxxxxxx

      Saturday was a very good day because i went with chiraag and Raju to Ipswich and Watched Harry Potter and we almost got kicked out and there was loads of mess around, but i was gtn realy pissed of with chiraag cos he would not shut up and him and raju started fighting and i was in between of them lol, that was fun though.   We then went to Mcd's (for the 2nd time) By this time i was getting realy pissed of with chiraag cos he ws backstabin every1 and saying that he could not trust me and Raju, cos we were trying to get im to tell us something, and i dont keep anything from any of ma mates and they no that so i was really pissed of. So i said that if he did not shut up bout every1 being bad friends and backstabin eva1 then i would walk out, and he continued so me and Raju both walked out on him HAHA he realy diserved that.  Him and Raju are now friends again but he wont even let me talk to him to tell him y so i aint going to bother cos i can do without friends like that. AND SO WHAT IF I ONLY HAVE ABOUT 5 FRIENDS THAT I LIVE NEHERE NEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!   HEHE last night i was all messed up though cos i thought that if chiraag h8ted me then all my other friends would go aswell cos he always gets his way and he will say stuff bout me to them probs aload of bull. But oh well i have other friends on the net that i can socialise with but that aint realy enough.  Right anywayz i gtg so byeeeeee xxxxxxx love all u faithfuls and friends etc well just every1 realy hehe byes

I foned Robyn a while ago at work and there was some twat tht tlkd to me and said that i sounded gay, he sounded like fat drunkn tossa so he cnt rly say owt bout me lol. He also kept sayin tht robyn was good in bed, i choose to ignore this lol, so i think he is a propa lad thn (some1 tht goes gts drunk all the time and thinks tht they are realy hard and are big headed and will shag ne gal even if they just met her, but i like to think of them as complete losers hehe)     I am gonna go down the town soon to get part of Robyns bday prezi and a card or 2 4 fun lol.

I think that he wants sex or summat and gtn moody cos vanessa wont have it with him lol. And Emma she was trien to tell Dan tht she wsnt thik and she said that she liked JADE GOODIER lol its Jade Goody derrrrr lol. Even i know tht and i am blonde lmao hehe  YAY the song of the moment is on the radio, Mario Whinins or howeva it is splt, i think it is class but not as good as my personal favorite at the mo which is Candy J tht kicks ass.  Yday Rob was showing of the nu fone tht he is got it is also a very good fone and i like it, its the Samsung E710 its gr8 especially the noise it makes wen u flip it open and closed. he got it on contract with Vodafone with 1000 evening and weekend mins and 250 txts.

      Right ok 1st things 1st, i am sorry for the rather large gap between the posts but i have been rather bussy.  Next it looks like i am turning into a complete faliure lol, i am doing realy shit in ma exams, and my mock results will be much better when they should b the other way around. Yesturday i completly failed ma geography xam no. 2 and every1 else came out saying that they found it soooo easy and i was da only one that f**ked up. Also this week my fear of spiders has got much worse and i sometimes feel like i am going to be sick when i see one, lol i know it sounds dramatic but it is true and i am realy terrified of spiders. 2day i have been revising for my R.E exam that i have very soon, I think that i shall do better in this exam then i did in the mock as i got a G in the mock and i have actually learnt some stuff that i need to know now so that is good. I recieved a parcel from my gf Robyn the other day and it had this really sweet bear in that i thought was a pig cos i thought it had a snout oops lol, a keyring that said nick loves robyn on the front and on the back that our love will last forever whcich i hope is true, also a england key ring, they are made from wood and are decorated by wood burning they are wicked! :D. The parcel also had to copied cds in that have some kewl songs on but some of them are too rocky for me but most of them i like :D. That was mainly for rob as he asked me yday wot i got lol.  any way that about all i got to say for now, oh xcept rob kindly lent me his old fone so that i cld put ma sim in as my fone is broken and i shld b gtn a new fone this weekend if any1 will go to ipswich with me :D bye xxxxxxxxxxxx
