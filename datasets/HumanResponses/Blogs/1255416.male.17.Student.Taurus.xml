      Well, just started this today, dunno exactly why, jsut figured I might ned a place to put my thoughts and examine them later, maybe even let some people in on it...  It's only 4:45 right now, might add some more later, might just never use this again, who knows...  Ohh, three lines, auspicious beginning..i'll get back to this later probably...

      Jesus....long day.  I've just gotten done with my homework.  I wrote a terrible essay describing my grandmother's apartment, trying to show through her possessions that she has a dynamic personality, that she's an interesting person..but the three page limit kinda kept me from going into enough detail to get that across.  I guess I understand the compulsion to write a novel, it's hard to get enough detail on a few pages to get a decent idea across without out and out saying it.  Anyway, Nadia said hi to me today after not talking to me for a little while.  I guess Stephanie convinced to ignore cause she didn't like me for whatever reason.  It's a good thing cause I didn't really like her all that much, though Nadia's cool.  Have you ever felt really really tired, but only mentally?  Like, a feeling of being drained, as if the frontal lobe of your brain could get fatigued.  I got that today...I could barely think for 3 or 4 hours, it's a terrible feeling.  Never actually had that before, it makes me feel really really stupid, like when I was high, absolutely drained and slow.  I guess that's what it feels like to be stupid and try and concentrate on a difficult concept, it just can't be done.  I hope I keep this thing updated..and I actually read through it later, I read through old e-mail now and it makes no sense, so many allusions that I can't remember.  This seems more stable and permanent, you know?  Maybe I won't be able to lose my junior year in the same way I've lost the rest of my life.  Crappy form of immortality, but it's the only one we's gots.  hmm, well, I'd better get to sleep, talk to you later blog!

      Wow, well, I guess i never used it, nice job Nathan!  And of all dates to get back here, September 11th.  The sad thing is, that unless I concentrate, all meaning has been sucked out of the date, it's just a random collection of alphanumeric symbols at this point.  When I concentrate though....quite depressing.  Well, right now it's 6:40 in the morning and i have to get to school in 5 minutes, I'll leave this page on, though, so i don't forget about this thing's existence again, thank you Slashdot and Google for reminding me.  See everyone, (or is it no one?) later.

      Yay, spring break, weeeeee  Spent most of the past few days at charlie dando's house, actually, it was pretty fun times, especially last night, staying up form like 11:00 to 4:00 in the morning talking about random crap is always nice, that and seeing charlie piss on campus drive...wait, that's gross.  Thank god i don't drive that way.  Reading an excellent new Rand book called "The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution"  About the "new" left of the 60's and 70's.  I love Rand's style and I love the fact that man is this just chock full of anthro answers, pragmatism answers, i knwo for a fact that i'm gonna be running so many objectivism k's next year it won't even be funny.  Trying to get a game to work and postpone sleep, but it's being a little bastard, which does suck, cause i kinda sorta was really waiting for this thing for quite a while.  Oh my god I love clone high, the fact that the best entertainment that MTV has ever put out was canceled because it was too high brow and was replaced by punk'd is also hilarious.  In a makes me want to poke my eyes out kind of way.....wesley  Gotta get up at 10:00 to go eat lunch with mom, dunno how that'll turn out, guess i'll find out shortly considering it's 1:00 in the morning right now.  Damn nocturnal behavior...like i'm some kind of evil wombat...or owl.  Actually, it's getting pretty late, better wrap this up, oh, my dad finally got the reaking forms in to whitman, so i'm definetly going there over the summer, Walla Walla here i come, baby.  Man that sounded nerdy.  -With all geekiness

      Well, i figure i might as well update this thing once again, gasp, twice in the same month, the world will implode, i swear.  Easy day at school, I hate Ms. Riley with an all-consuming passion, but at least i wasn't working with complete and total morons all day.  Fourth was long, but i got an assload done, God I lvoe off periods, if it weren't for them I might actually, you know, have to do math homework at home.  And that would be a crime.  Took a rediculously easy test sixth, and then wnet to forensics practice where i proceeded to not get any work done and then drove around with a bunch of freshman and sophomores to Chipotle for no particular reason...they'd better fucking pay me back, I need that cash.  Maybe I shouldn't have done that....I jsut haven't been taking CX all that seriously since we didn't qual for state.  Ahh, that was sucky, sucky day, you go the entire day, thinking you did REALLY well, unexpectedly so.  You hit a reasonably good team alst round, meaning at least something's going well, and then boom, brock qualifies in extemp.  Dreams shattered.  Fucking judges, I hate them with an all-consuming passion.  Nest yera WILL be better, if Borkc and I could go 2-2 at quals with almsot zero experience, we can break next year.  That's all I want, to break to state, from there, sky's the limit.  there's always college to do better than that....  NDT here i come....(HA!)  I'm increasingly wanting to get outdoors, but I can just never get anything planned, maybe I could take Elliott up to the mountains aroudn his birthday ro soemthing, get up above Lake Isabelle, something of that nature, it'd be ncie spending some time with him and getting the fuck up to the mountains.  I'm also missing having a girlfriend lately, but I can't really help that particularly, Just give it some time, nahtan, just give it some time, things'll turn around.  Now if only laser hari removal surgery wasn't so expensive.  That was a joke.  I get so much shit for being jewish, it hurts, and I don't understand why.  i mean, hell, I was born into a differnet religion than 99 percent of american, whoopydy freaking doo, it doens't matter.  People just seem to be so damn fascinated by that which is different than them.  It wouldn't be so bad, thouh, if people weren't such dumbasses.  If i could count the number fo times people were surprised that i mentioned i had a ham sandwich or something, I'd be god damned deep blue.  Hoping that spring break will be mroe eventful than usual, but who knwos, that's a crapshoot.  Maybe something'll come up and i won't b ebored to tears, maybe not, either way i get to read the new Ayn Rand book that i ALSO can apply to debate that i'm getting: The new left: the anti-industrial revolution  I can almost taste the anthro answers...  ANd to end this, Luke Sweet, if you ever read thsi thing, you're still a dick

      Wow, tlak to you later blog, yeah, six months later, i guess there's really no compulsion to actually write in something like this unless other people are reading it, hell, might put a link in my AIM profile or something or other.  So what's hapenned in the last six months of my life...hmm...  Well, I've pretty much reorganized all my friendships, i.e. I hang out predominately with two guys i know named Matt and Jay and play computer games over at Matt's house or charlie's house.  I know, exciting.  I mean, it can be nice, it can be fun, it can be entertaining, but the whole thing is just so fucking shallow.  I guess nearly all friendships are shallow, I've had very few that aren't.  Not to say the peopel are shallow, Matt, jay, Charlie, Derek, Mac, they're all great people who i enjoy being around, but i dunno, playing a game that takes extremely little rational thought for 4 hours straight can get a tad boring.  MAybe i just need more substance in my life.  Ap chem is taking up assloads of time.  That's right, assloads, literally.  It hurts to think how much stuff we'll have to knwo by the end of the year, by heart, and how badly we're being taught it.  That doesn't make any sense outside of context, let me explain.  We started the year with Ms. ANdrew, a really great person and an excellent teacher.  She was funny, she was extremely smart, and she made a possibly horribly boring subject into sometyihng that amde sense to me, that was fun.  She was pregnant the entire year, though, and when she had her baby in february suddenly we were being taught by a video.  Yes, you heard that right, a god damn VHS tape put out by CU denver.  It fucking sucks.  No one understands the material at all, the average on the last test was a D+ and the sad thign is I'mt aking an AP test over all thsi shit later this year....and i'm not going to do all that well because the materail was  so  poorly covered.  It freaking hurts.  CX is also taking up my life, though to a much lesser extent lately.  Debate is great, I love it, it allows me to crush the minds of lesser mortals, and what the hell coud be better than that?  Hell, i'm even going to Whitamn over the summer for two weeks of debate camp!  It'll be fucking great, I'LL KNOW HOW TO RUN A GOD DAMNED KRITIK!!!  I love it.  Love life, on the other hand has been rotting in a pit for, i'm pretty sure, more than a year.  Havne't kept track.  It kinda sucks, but oh well, you win some and you lose some and thngs'll turn around eventually, hell, i'm interested in a couple girls right now.... though i'll probably chicken out, sadly enough.  Well, that's 500 words, so I guess i'll leave you now, prolly post on thsi again now that there's a chance of people, you know, actually reading it.

      Dammit, I'm angry.  I got a gmail account (www.gmail.com, for the unninitiated) and just now foudn out that i could have given it away from upwards of 70 bucks.  Not even that, I could have given away the TWO invitations i was given for a combined total of an amount of money I don't really want to think about.  Damn it all to hell.  But beyond that I'm doing pretty damn well.  Finals start on friday and I already have 75 percent of them done.  I've got very little forseeable homework (actually, a grnad total of 2 assignments) and am secure in the knowledge that this time next week I will seriously be rocking out to the fact that finally, finally it will be summer (4th period off, bitches!).  Oh, hope you like the new look for the blog, wanted people to comment.  By the way, for anyone interested in my oh-so-well-informed political opinons (hell, if you read this thing) check out my and Joe Seago's political debate blog at pinko-vs-biggot.blogspot.com.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised over who's the biggot and who's the pinko.  Man, i crack myself up

      WEll, how 'bout i update this thing so that all of you who obsessively check my AIM buddy info get something interesting to read.  The last couple weeks have been mighty stressful...damn Ap ests and classes coming to their culmination.  I've actually gotta get up early tomorrow (a wednesday) and go to a review for AP chem, I've got two pages of notes for next year's CX topic that need fact checking and finding-cards-for (also known as randomly looking for quotes by famous-sounding people that say things i want them to say...but that should be done mostly at camp.  I jsut need background info).  The big news i referred to in my last post was asking lisa lewis to prom, sadly she said no.  Oh well.  Such is life.  Been having a good time fo it though, went up to the mountains with matt last ngiht, which was really freaking fun.  Had a nice long conversation with him, which was really nice, I really miss the whole rediculously long converastion thing that you coudl have with people while hiking.  Ahh, Cheley...  Again, what are you gonna do.  I'm getting an application from Steve Oskjay to get a job at this media research place soon, hwich should get me some pocket change, hopefully.  I've also been looking at school's...I really need good board scores is what it comes down to...damn not having good enough grades for the cream of the crop, fucking you miss bratun.  Sorry for the haphazard writing style of this entry, I'm listening to Ben folds and typing a lot faster than i normally do and it's causing me to not really think aobut wha ti'm writing.  Yay spew!  I have one real goal for this summer: find a girl who's interesting, intelligent, (hopefully) attractive, and who's attracted to me...that needs to be done...soon.  Damn life.  OKeydoke, that came out a little weird, whatever, talk to you all later.  Sorry for the spelling and grammar, whatever

      I'm fucking nocturnal.  For some reason, even though I got 3 and a half hours of sleep and only had about an hour and a half nap (kinda-sorta passed out around 4:30) I can't go to sleep.  this is a bad pattern, summer's gonna be kinda difficult on the sleeping side I'd guess.  Whatever, I got a feeling this is gonna be good.  I have a car, I know good trails, I have firends, things are looking up.  Stuff's gonna be going down, I can keep busy (go 600 page chomsky book that came today)and the world seems good.  Things being on the up and up is always nice...now if only things were on the up and up on the girl angle.  Sigh, stuff'll happen, whatever, the world'll survive and humanity will come back from the brink of extinction.  Yes, this is a twilight zone episode, and there go my glasses.  Dammit, I'm sounding stream-of-consciousness, I hate that, stream-of-consciousness is bullshit.  I need to have more of a plan to what I have to say with my life.  I need to go back and read this self-indulgent tripe.  I need to stop sounding like a pretentious fuck.  christian was right, i'm haughty, I think I'm better than other people.  Is this true, is this false?  God knows?  Is it bad, is it good...that's my basic philisophical question of my life.  Who's more important, me, or other people.  Rand or Plato.  Am I bitter?  I don't think so...it might just be the indigestion from the chiptole, god knows.  I guess i jsut don't understand myself.  I need introspection.  logical introspection, none fo this bullshit.  I wonder if blogger edits out the cursing, never checked...  Oh, you should check  this  out... http://http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/letters_to_editor/article/0,1713,BDC_2491_2939058,00.html  I rule!

      I just had a very basic revelation.  Art is not in the performance, it is in the capacity to move.  Ashley and I were once having an argument.  I said that a computer would be just as capable of creating a beuatiful piece of music as anything produced by a trained musician.  I was wrong.  I thought that what poeple thought of as artistic expression was actually just an imaginary imperfection placed in the music or whatever.  This isn't true.  great art can cause someone to feel something.  Bad art doesn't.  The most obvious example is acting.  A technically bad actor will most always be terrible.  A technically bad actor will also be very easy to spot.  However, just because someone is technically good, doesn't mean they're a good actor.  A good actor is someone who can make the audience feel something, be it happiness, sadness, pity, whatever.  If the audience is bored or if the audience jsut plain doesn't like a certain part of a play, then it's bad acting.  Plain and simple.  No amount of technical superiority can fix this.  I probably should have realized this loooong ago, but no matter, any thoughts anyone who actually reads this thing?  Who does read this thing anyway?

						   I completely agree with Joe about punishing the prison guards (I don't think anyone in their right mind disagrees) I even think the sentence served on spc. Sivits earlier this week (one year in prison along with testifying against other guards) was much too lenient. The soldiers that decided it would be a good idea to pour acid on a prisoner's back or force them to have sex with each other should spend a long, long time in prison. That would also go a long way to convincing the rest of the world that the United States punishes harshly for breaking military law.   What Joe next goes into, and where we disagree, is that the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld is warranted right now. Yes, Joe, the buck does stop at Rumsfeld's desk. Yes, he should have been aware and probably was aware, of the fact that certain interrogation methods were being used. Last fall the Red Cross brought the fact that there might be abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to the attention of the administration. There were, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell "High level talks" about the possibility of abuse. However, nothing was done. Why is this?  Interrogation is not a pretty thing. Anybody who's seen an episode of Law and Order knows what I'm talking about. Interrogation (and completely legal interrogation) in a war zone is even worse. Before a couple weeks ago no one would have even considered abuse as damming as the red cross said was occurring in it's report, which (excerpted from the executive summary) ranged from  * Brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury;  * Absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families;  * Physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information;  * Prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight;  * Excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment....  Most of these methods are perfectly legal and within the bounds of the Geneva Convention and are used by militaries worldwide. The rest could easily be seen by the administration as the exaggerations of an organization which has been against the occupation from day one.  Also, any use of interrogation methods that might be construed as violating the Geneva convention have since been banned although they were never legally used in Iraq, as none of these methods were ever requested for (in order to use them a prison had to get the ok of the commanding general) meaning that any use of them was completely illegal.   With all these facts weighing in plus the overriding need to keep constant leadership in a time when the balance is so fickle (official turnover to the Iraqis will occur in a bit more than a month) Rumsfeld mustn’t get out of office. His sheer workload, drive, and sense of public duty make him right now the best man for the job. Now is not the time to have someone getting used to a job at a time when necessity demands a 12 hour workday 7 days a week. Also, Joe, Rumsfeld ain't exactly Richard Nixon, now is he? I don't see him blatantly doing any criminal acts, like, say lying to a grand jury. In fact, he's done quite the opposite. He's owned up to his failures and he knows that he has to be even more aware and even more vigilant of exactly what the military is doing.  I also, sadly, have to agree with Joe's conclusions about America's image. I was just watching the daily show tonight (Gasp! A conservative who can laugh!) and he had an Arab mention something about how he'd feel, that in order to make a comparison, we should picture "what it would be like if Iraqis were doing it to Americans on American soil." I only hope that the turnover to Iraqi control will go well and the whole situation in the middle-east won't spiral out of control, no one wants the plot of a bad Tom Clancy book happening in real life...

						   The atrocities that have permeated the media the past few weeks have many aspects to them that explain a great deal about conservative mentality and the ever-growing need to get Bush out of office. I feel justice should be served to those who carried out the inhumane acts against Abu Ghraib prisoners. Whether they knew what they were doing or they were manipulated or ill-informed, justice should be served. Appropriate punishment should be administered and justice should be served. I understand this is only a few select soldiers and does not bear relevance to the rest of the Armed Services. I still support our troops and am in a debt of gratitude for their service. I also understand other countries and frustrated citizens within these foreign countries do not necessarily understand or support these sentiments. I just ask those thinking about this issue to think about how this looks to the rest of the world. God bless the Great American Liberators, right?   Although great fault rests on the shoulders of those who carried out these acts, even a greater amount of fault rests on the shoulders of those who presided over these tragic trespasses against humanity. As Nathan pointed out, some have called for Rumsfailed's resignation. I have to say I would not cry a single tear nor protest one bit if Rummy stepped down. Yes, Nathan, Don has experience. However, that does not justify his various failures and mishandling of the prison abuse and torture. I can think of an abundance of figureheads who had a great amount of experience yet were forced to resign due to various shady activities. Remember Nixon? I don't recall hearing about anyone protesting the resignation of Nixon due to his political experience. I also don't recall anyone protesting Clinton's impeachment due to his many years of experience as President- not even from liberals or Democrats. (They rightfully protested the impeachment due to a lack of strong justification. Censuring the President for putting his dick in the wrong place and trying to get away with it, sure. Impeachment? I don't think so.) Yes, the Commander-in-Thief, Rumsfailed, and the other cabinet members did not physically carry out these acts. They did, however, as Nathan said himself: "...[carry] out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently." Excellently is debatable. Well, now that I think of it, carrying out the policies set forth by the President is debatable as well. I don't think the New Yorker reported that Bush approved a decision last year which "[expanded] a classified operation for the aggressive interrogations to Iraqi prisoners..." (See Comcast Article Below) They reported the man responsible for that action was indeed Rumsfeld. Granted, the Pentagon denied the allegations within the New Yorker article, yet when haven't they denied true and false allegations? We all know how credible the administration's word is; honest as honest can be. I wouldn't say as credible as Hersh, the reporter who broke the story, however. The reporter has a lot of experience ;). (In a break from the sarcasm, Hersh truly does have established credibility.)  If you read the AP article accessible at: http://www.comcast.net/News/DOMESTIC/XML/1151_President__White_House__Advisers/7dc7fb7f-ca89-44d5-a85e-b951655e7851.html, you will see that "there were high-level discussions within the Bush administration last fall about information from the International Committee of the Red Cross alleging inmate abuse at the U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq." Nathan, I thought you said Bush wasn't informed of the abuse. Granted, as shown in the past, Bush isn't quite qualified to fully understand briefings. Can you at least agree that Rummy knew the full extent of the abuse as soon as last January? (http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/172703_thomas11.html) It's sickening to think that the administration in part or full knew about the abuse, tried to keep it a secret from the public, and once the public was informed about the abuse, claim to not have to apologize for the atrocities. Do you realize they didn't apologize until public opinion toward a lack of apology turned sour? Do you realize they base their policies on that mentality- don't apologize or concede until public opinion requires it. Do you realize Rummy didn't even talk to a single prisoner at Abu Ghraib when he visited it recently? Do you realize that this incident stems more from aggressive rhetoric and corrupt leadership than "apathy on our part"? That is why Rummy must resign and send the right message to the rest of the world: our country doesn't tolerate this kind of (mis)leadership. If you consider these things as fulfilling "his duties as the civilian leader of one of the world’s largest military" (sic) then so be it. Yet, as the civilian leader of the military, Rumsfailed bears some responsibility for these kinds of scandals. He certainly does not deserve a flattering label given to him by Cheney who proclaimed: "Don Rumsfeld is the best secretary of defense the United States has ever had." Even better than Cheney, who served under Daddy Bush as Secretary of Defense? (http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=5081294)  I would continue with my dissatisfaction with Inhofe and the radical right-wing reaction, the lack of adherence to the Geneva Conventions, the interesting Red Cross statistic which states that up to 90 percent of those arrested and detained at Abu Ghraib were arrested by mistake, and more, but I don't want to write a novel. I will close by answering the fundamental question posed: What does this abuse mean? It means that our credibility has been tainted further and future relations with countries will take a long time to heal. We can all thank the Bush administration for that by sending them back home in November. Perhaps the village in Texas will even regain its idiot. This truly is Bush's Vietnam. If this abuse scandal hasn't proven that to you yet, then I direct you to any resource which discusses Vietnam's My Lai Massacre. If I didn't assure you before, I do still support our troops. I agree with Nathan that we need to thank them for their service. We need to thank them, support them, and bring them home.

						   Stories (and pictures) of what can only be characterized as torture by American soldiers on Iraqi prisoners have flooded the news recently.  Domestically, the story has met with widespread disgust.  Politically it has met with calls for Rumsfeld’s resignation on the left and been passed off as not that big of a deal by the right.  Neither of these positions is correct.  The Iraq prison abuse is, of course, a very terrible thing.  However, it shouldn’t reflect badly on the Bush administration. At the highest levels, on the shoulders of the President, the responsibility for the scandal cannot be laid.  The president was simply never informed of the abuse.  He has publicly said that he was shocked and appalled at the images.  And, in good conscience, no man in his right mind could condone actions like this. Below the president, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld cannot and should not hold blame for the scandal.  A shakeup at the military’s highest level, Rumsfeld’s desk, would only exacerbate the underlying problem causing the abuse in the Iraqi prison system.  Rumsfeld, whether you like him or not, has experience.  He’s been secretary of defense through a major terrorist attack, two wars, and countless minor crises.  Rumsfeld knows his job and, despite this failure, has carried out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently.  You can disagree with the policies, but you can’t argue that Rumsfeld hasn’t fulfilled his duties as the civilian leader of one of the world’s largest military. The real problem and what the media seems to be missing is the obvious systematic malfunction in the American military.  This disgusting, sadistic behavior has to be a symptom of larger problems.  No organized, high morale, disciplined military would ever allow anything like this to happen.  Only ridiculously low morale could possibly cause the blatant disregard for military procedure or even basic human decency.  Only at one time in American history has the US military gone through a similar scandal.  In the 70’s, following Vietnam, the entire American military practically cracked under social pressures.  A soldier was seen by the public as some kind of moron who couldn’t get around military service.  Who would want to be part of an organization that killed babies and burned villages, the thinking went.  Drug use was rampant, discipline lax, American military bases were trash-filled dumps, allegations of rape spread like wildfire, and the entire command structure was for all intents and purposes, ignored.  If not for radical military reorganization in the 80’s the American military wouldn’t have been prepared for even its most basic duties.  America would have been left defenseless.  The same problem is affecting the military today.  Soldiers overseas see a brutal, seemingly endless war, an American populace once again hostile to the military and the cause for which they are fighting, and no reason to continue to struggle.  Soldiers are obviously ignoring the commands of their superior officers and taking out their frustration on the Iraqis.  Something needs to budge.  We, right here at home, have the ability to change things. We all need to support the military.  Write a letter to your congressman asking him to get the government moving on finding the real, basic reasons for the lax discipline exemplified by the Iraq prison abuse.  When you see a soldier returning home from Iraq, give him your thanks.  Don’t allow people to trivialize the military for their service to you.  And think that service to this country immoral or useless.  This scandal was caused by apathy on our part.  All we need to do is show the soldiers in Iraq that we care for their hard work and sacrifice.  If that happens, nothing as horrible as what we’ve seen the past week will ever happen again.

						   ...it will be in blog form!  Nathan and I have always enjoyed discussing politics and have decided to channel that enjoyment and spread it to you all. I am excited something like this is finally underway. I hope to have periodic "columns" and point-counterpoint debates on various issues. I also hope comments from the blog's audience will not be scarce. Like Nathan said, all comments and opinions are welcome and will be respected. The first topic, the Iraq prison abuse, will be an interesting one. Stay tuned, check back tomorrow, and tell all your friends! ( Yes, both of them. ;) )  P.S. As always, fight the power!

						   Welcome to my and Joe's little experiment in high school political commentary.  On this blog we hope to offer some incisive, cutting, and always entertaining political point-counterpoint on all the relevant issues of the day.  Everything from policy in Iraq to Whether Bush looks like a monkey will be covered and then, if you feel like it, discussed ad nauseum by you.  All comments are welcome by everyone (even if you're an anonymous coward) and all opinions will be respected.  Hopefully this'll turn out great and we'll be able to work this summer and next school year.  Viva la Revolucion!  Tomorrow, the Iraqi prison torture, what does it mean?

						   As you can see, this blog is dead. What was once an exciting venture is now a mere memory in cyberspace. Who knows what will happen to this blog, for few things are certain.  What is certain is that both Nathan and I will continue to dedicate ourselves to politics, discourse, and democracy. (Pardon me for the corny speech, it's late at night.)  I have decided to start a new blog. It is called:  urlLink Invade This!  and will contain personal essays, analysis, articles, and general talking points. (Comments from potential sympathizers and critics as well!) It will of course pertain to politics and current events, but as I said before, few things are certain. Will it stay in the realm of politics and current events? Most likely. Will it remain active for a substantial period of time? Doubtful. Is it even worth perusing? As long as there is a thing called boredom, the answer is absolutely.
