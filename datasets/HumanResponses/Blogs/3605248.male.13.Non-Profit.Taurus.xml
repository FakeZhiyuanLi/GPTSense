      I Won't Complain  I've had some good days I've had some hills to climb I've had some weary days And some sleepless nights  But when I think things over All of my good days Outweigh my bad days So I say thank you Lord I won't complain  Sometimes the clouds are low I can hardly see the road I ask a question,  Lord, why so much pain? But he knows what's best for me Although my weary eyes can't see So I'll just say thank you Lord I won't complain  The Lord has been so good to me He's been good to me More than this old world could ever be He's been so good to me  He dried all of my tears away Turned my midnights into day So I'll just say thank you Lord I won't complain  (this is not an original by me i just like it)

      i got bak from camp i had a blast....i dont think kira is the right girl for me i prayed and did a lot of soul searching at camp and realised i need to focus more on God than girls and that same night she rejected me .... funny how God always works out things yar i feel as a heavy burden has been lifted and praise God when in the mountain or in the valley or even in complete peace

      (slow talking) Im saying goodbye To the fields gray Im saying good bye to the rainy days (more upbeat) Im singing , Im saying it , goodbye (slower music) But when i have to say goodbye to you,  it breaks my heart with all that weve been through but there comes a time when you have to say .... Goodbye

      A deep black sea surrounds me raining and puring down on me tearing ripping slashing at me drowning in this deep dark sea wich is flooding me and then i see the suns sweet light coming to save me and then i think of ....her and a deep black sea surrounds me ~tyler
