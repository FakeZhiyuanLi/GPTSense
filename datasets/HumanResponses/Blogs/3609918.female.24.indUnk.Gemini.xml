      YAAA!! today the weather is sofa king nice, and here i am, i've sacrificed myself to the god/goddess of laundry, cleaning, and packing...  in related news, i've lost a whole bra to the process of laundering things. how the hell does that happen? and i only have, like, two bras to begin with. man i hope i didn't throw it in the dryer, cuz we all know what that means, i'm talkin' to the ladies here, and it means preparing for the stealth removal of the intrusive boob-poking underwire sometime in the near future, in the most inconvenient of places and times. like, in the middle of class, or work, or somewhere on public transportation...maybe you think you are being sneaky, maybe you think no one will see...but as the deed is over, you look around and find that there is one innocent bystander who has seen you remove the underwire. everytime i throw a bra in the dryer, i guess the thing that keeps the underwires from attacking my funbags melts off and floats away. and then, as stated above, the underwire will cause a little distress during the day, which can be handled, but soon launches a full-on attack when you least expect it. usually, right before it's time for you to go home, but still unbearable enough so that it must STOP. NOW.  oy. my dear bra:  urlLink    click to enlarge&nbsp; urlLink     hey everybody, i got bit on the armpit by a mosquito.  yeah and i talked to my mom today. i broke down and told her i was riding a bike to NY. i'm such a sucker. i wasn't gonna tell her because i didn't want her to worry, but i'm horrible at being sneaky and lying, even though i live 2,000 miles away from her. she had two things to say: 1) you better have your cell phone so you can call 2) you better NOT do it alone (she said this one several times)  i love my mom.  in a previous post, i talked about how much i disliked my previous job, but i forgot to mention, minus the few dope mofos that i met. amy is one of em. if you can think of someone who is 100% different than me, it's amy. i hadn't seen her since i quit. we hung out last night and when i got into her car, she started laughing at me and said, "we are so totally different." (this is the first time she saw me with a mohawk.) it's crazy, we are different in every single way, and every time we hang out we discover some new and exciting way that we are totally and completely different from each other, and then we laugh for about 10 minutes about it. just EVERYTHING is the opposite. and neither one of us, at any point, has made any effort to be like the other one. we don't eat each other's food, or wear clothes like the other one, or any of that other nonsense. and we never try to get the other one to change (one time i let her dress me up like a hussy though and we went "clubbin"-i think that's what the kids are callin' it these days).   i love it, and you should too.  AND...yesterday i went to the taste of chicago (huge street food fair) with danielle. listen to these little clips of conversation:  (on the way there)-----------  me: "i'm so F*ING hungry, i haven't eaten in a day-anna-half, if i don't eat soon i'm gonna kill you." d: "we could've gotten something at one of the food places in my building."  me: "i thought we were walking to the taste right now? wait, are we?" d: "oh yeah"  (insert a local band playing beatles' music)--------  d: "whoa, i really love reggae, we should go to a reggae bar soon" me: "hey, this is a beatles' song...is that what made you think of the reggae bar?" d: "yeah...this is the beatles?"  if that isn't funny, you had to be there. it was funny. it still is, YA!

      EVERYBODY! f*ing put down that crack pipe and listen to this. i would like to dedicate this next post to my friend melina. she has somehow gotten the impression that i'm a f*ing dating service, and her slave. and i am both of those things, mind you. melina is pretty close to being the funniest mutherhumper that i know on the planet, and she doesn't even have to hump muthers to do it. HOLY SHIT SHE IS FUNNY. really. one time her mom found her vibrator, she told her mom it was a foot massager, and her mom BELIEVED IT. melina is mexican. she is also really girlie, and uses really good lip stuff/balm/shiny stuff/grease. she doesn't have herpes (i ask her every time i need to use her lipstuff). she will send you really dirty, nasty text messages and sexually explicit voicemails in the middle of the night. i can only aspire to make out with the melina. but she doesn't generally love the ladies (however, i have seen her have "eye sex" with a number of her female friends). i think she likes men who are well-hung, and have muscles. speaking spanish would be a plus for you, so you know what the hell she is yelling at you. we had a chat this evening, and here is some of how it all went down:  BLoOKunGFOo (12:47:46 AM): HEY!

      i really, honestly think i am going crazy. loony. nuts. bolts and all of that fun stuff. there's some really weird things going on. totally unexplainable. that kind of thing where all signs are pointing somewhere. but then you get there and then now what? man, i am being a vague lady. i'm a vague-a-bond. ha. cheese. no, but. hmm. okay. well. all these signs that have slapped me over the head have been leading me to yet another sign that says, "just commit and finish." and they're saying, "hey HEYHEY...just decide something already. it gets easy after that."  i know i have a fucking fear of committing. i KNOW ALREADY. jesus i wish everything i just randomly pick up and read wouldn't remind me so much of that. but it'll just keep happening until i decide. should i finish school? should i get married? should i have a kid? yeah right, none of this should involve me dragging somebody else into this mess with me. fo SHO. this summer is my right of passage. this is when i decide. no more fucking twiddling my thumbs, dammit. i need to finish something. i can't even finish twiddling my thumbs.   i think i need to make more contact with random strangers. i need to hear more stories. i need to listen i need to stop talking and LISTEN. i want people to call the wrong number, hear me answer and then just tell me what happened. i would love that. one time, there was this guy who kept calling me and he kept getting the wrong number. so one day we just chatted. and then i put a message on the voicemail that said, "ROB. you got the WRONG NUMBER AGAIN." he left a coupla messages and then that was that. i like sporadic 2 second relationships with strangers (the fear of committing thing comes up). i'm done talking about this.  i decided also that i need to get on a regular schedule of sleep. this on again, off again thing is making me nuts.   so and yeah, the Taste of Chicago is going on this week. this is where tons of different vendors get together in this huge park downtown and sell food. i love food. i told my friend danielle that i might eat meat, and this would be the last meaty thing i ate, ever again. i'm always in and out of vegetarianism. but i'm not so sure i can follow through with this. i mean, the eating of the meat. but if anyone has to see me eat the last of my meat, it has to be one of the littwin family. when i moved here, i started a short binge of meat-eating with the littwins. they made it seem so appealing yet so scandalous. and i got sucked in. soon i was eating beef jerky and breakfast patties. then i realized i was totally off the wagon, so i had to stop. i'm also done talking about this.   enough already.

      i just posted, but i had to write this. the gay pride parade was today, and i didn't go, cuz i wasn't in the mood. but it was actually broadcast on television, so i had to watch it, and here is some select commentary i heard from the announcers (insert tv personality, feigning warmth and that loving, bubbly glow they all seem to share).  male announcer: "and y'know Janet, EVERyone LOOOVES drag queens..."  female announcer: "WHOA...WHOoo is on TOP of THAAAT??! now he is EXPRESSING himself...he's on some sort of rainbow tube..."(some guy is, in fact, on rainbow tubing, hump-dancing, and just goin' at it, super sexualchocolate-like)  female: "oh..i see...that's some sort of pirate ship..."  male: "now here's the mostly gay swim club..."  female: "oh wow-look at that-here are the gay buddhists..."  female: "there's this gigantic thing, i'm not sure what it is, but i'm gonna say it's a burrito..."  some random facts i learned:  -there are less police at the pride parade than almost any other     parade in chicago (but it's the 2nd largest parade in chicago)  -mayor daley is one of the prime supporters of gay marriage  -the biggest pride parade is in south america  -there were 375-400 thousand people in the streets  -illinois is 5th as far as same sex couples go  1)California 2)New york 3)Texas 4)Florida  -chicago has the 3rd largest parade in the u.s.   (behind SF & NY)  for those of you who don't know why there's a parade, here's some history, and if i get it wrong, somebody correct me. i have a pretty good idea i'm gonna fark this up real good:  in the late 60's in ny, police used to raid bars and shut them down because of all that crazy queer activity goin' on inside of them. on june 26th, 1969(not sure of exact date), at the stonewall bar in ny, some people stood up and refused to be oppressed (YEAH). which turned into a riot, and i think some people died. as you can tell, i don't know specifics, but it's yer basic protest to the unnecessary behavior on the government's part that turns awry and innocent people get battered and killed. so anyway, after that, june became pride month, and people started marching at the end of june to remember the stonewall incident/riot. i'm not sure of when it became a parade, but it did. in smaller places, and in more conservative countries, they still just march.   i love stories when it involves damning the man.

      man i really love dictionary.com...do you really think i could poop out a word like synchronics all by myself? actually, not so much poop it out, but to realize that sychronics is a bonafide word in the english language?  i had a really farking amazing day. i went running in the industrial part of my city and saw this clan of really curious, unusually large kitties. so of course, being the sucker that i am for pussy(HA!-not really, but i set myself up, so i had to take it) i had to investigate. "oh prettykitty prettykitty..." hey..uh, those aren't cats, uh, they're SKUNKS! yeah, really, i know.  so i was thinking of the metric system today and how music and math should be best friends, and if they're not, how well they would get along and how i could set them up together sometime, then i thought of the string theory, not that i really know anything about the string theory, but from what i get there's certain string vibrations, or levels of harmonics, that are holding the universe together. and how the internet could be a catalyst in such an investigation, y'know things being interlocked and webbed...and how the mayan calender fits in to play...and um, the resonance, man, the RESONANCE, andandand..CHAKRAS, yeah, dude, TOTALLY..chakras...and yo, where the hell does electricity and magnetism fit into all of this? does anybody have answers for me?  yeah and tonight i also meandered my way into the forest for the most amazing thing i had seen in a long long time. i hit this clearing, it's dark mind you, and i see just hundreds of lightning bugs. so i feel like i'm sitting at the edge of a stadium, surrounded by trees, and they're all taking pictures. the dopeshit. i'm gonna miss lightning bugs when i leave. and really, how does one shoot light out of their ass? i must find the answer.  here it is:  Text      :  Why do lightning bugs glow in the dark?  Response #:  1 of 1 Author:      Jim Murray Text:        Do you mean "why" or "how"?  They glow in the dark as part of a communication system they use to find mates.  The female waits and flashes at flying males.  The males flash back and try to find the right species females.     The temporal and spatial pattern of the light flashes confer species  specificity - usually.  Biology is a case in exceptions.  There is one species of firefly whose females flash in many different ways to attract other species males.  When the wrong species male arrives, he is eaten!  Gives new meaning to not believing everything you see.    As to how they glow:  they use two chemicals called luciferin and luciferase.  The luciferase is an enzyme, a protein catalyst which is not consumed in its reaction with luciferin. The luciferin changes chemically and gives off light.  Whenever an electron drops  an energy level (a quantum leap) in a molecule, it gives off a photon of light.

      since your friend over here goes through spasmodic fits of anal retentive activity, she's decided to re-map the entire bike ride to NY, involving ALL county roads and no major route numbers, whatsoever. yahoo maps, suckas. i will literally know every inch from here to NY.   i also think that if christianity is right, everyone is going to hell. i need to find out the statistics of how many people actually die of heart disease, cancers, and other life-threatening diseases due to voluntary unhealthy habits (i.e., over-eating bad foods, drinking too much, smoking too much). why do people knowingly put too much of something into their bodies that's gonna make them die? these are all slow methods of suicide. suicide is the leading cause of hellbound souls. i read that in some pamphlet on christianity that i got from jesus himself whilst riding the train (and i thought jesus was jewish? hmmm...i guess we all believe in ourselves, sometimes).  and then there's the other part of me that says, eh, who cares? because we all know that cars cause pollution, and some of us live, voluntarily, in cities with higher amounts of carcinogens floating around than others. so just knowing that we are letting ourselves reside in a place that gives us a greater chance of developing cancerous cells and therefore a greater chance of dying, means that we are all committing a slow suicide. so whatever, what the hell was jesus doing on public transportation anyway? if he comes back and lives in chicago, and then gets lung cancer and dies, well POOP. that's some farked up shiz, right thurr.   ---whoa, my dad just told me some farked-up story, will tell later---  while you are all waiting in anticipation, check out my mayan oracle:                                                                                 White Solar Wind  Red Eastern Castle of Turning Earth family- Core &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clan- Fire  Galactic Activation Portal    &nbsp;   I pulse in order to communicate Realizing breath I seal the input of spirit With the solar tone of intention I am guided by the power of endlessness I am a galactic activation portal &nbsp;&nbsp;enter me

      i wish i didn't have to sleep so much. i'm tired of sleeping. everything should bustle for more hours in the day. there should be androids doing shit by now, or at least some holograms. giving the illusion of bustle. maybe in the future the government will actually do that. when the economy gets so bad and there's some sort of urban war going on, there'll be robots and holograms just moving around like everything's normal. then the humans will follow suit, because we do things like that. there's something about seeing a lot of people in one place, bustling, that i like. but i also like walking down the empty streets after a long day of bustle. nobody but me, looking in the windows at people to see what they do. everytime i walk down a street a look at people right in the eyes. everytime i walk down a neighborhood at night i look in houses, to see what families do.    i really, honestly don't understand any human thing whatsoever. but really, everything that ever happened and ever will all makes sense.  i love my friends and i love my family. AH.

      so i'm going through life, okay...and i get older and i think, "hey, don't be an ass, start paying attention." and the more i do this, the more i remember, making all these mental notes, just keeping them in the back of my mind, y'know, just in case. there are a million imprints implanted every goddamn day, just tons and tons of information. throughout this whole ordeal, only a few things actually make you stop and look, and you take a mental polaroid picture. these are the things you remember, when you need to remember them. then you cross paths with other people and they give you the most intricate details of the things you thought were only in your own head at the time. now you don't know if you're really your own individual, or if yer just a mirror for everyone else.   there's no such thing as coincidence, right?  i could start listing the events, but it wouldn't do any good.

      yeah. bill clinton is my muse, i decided. he's hot. oh how i wish i were a white house intern back in his glory...i saw him on charlie rose about 12 hours ago, and i can't seem to get over him... man, i was totally impressionable today. i saw bill clinton and it made me want to join politics, after that the BBC news came on, and it inspired me to write a list of the immediate languages i'm gonna learn (not in this particular order): spanish (also french, italian, and portuguese, but i think they're all romantic languages so if you got one, you got the others, eh) polish japanese is russian a language anymore? some scandinavian language  then after the BBC, a nun with a horribly bad speech impediment came on and talked about her travels through the boston museum of fine art. i was so pissed at her for having that speech impediment, that i couldn't look at the screen for the longest time because i didn't want to look at the only nun i've ever wanted to DESTROY. i realised the error of my way soon after, and asked forgiveness. she was cool with it, and said (telepathically), "it wasn't the first time and i doubt it'll be the last." so then i watched her show.  after that i made a life-map. i decided that i'm gonna finish college, work with glass, join the peace corps, and become a teacher. when i was talking with sen the other day , i sez "hey, i think i really am gonna be a teacher, i always say i wanna be a teacher..." and then she sez, "yeah, well umm, that's the thing you most consistently say.." oh the truth. sometimes it doesn't hurt, but it's pretty damn funny.  so i had this dream, and avril lavigne was in it. she thought i was cool and she kept following me cuz she wanted to be cool like me. and i was like, "OKAAYYY...we can hang out." and she asked her mom and her mom sez, "that's fine but NO PARTIES." WHAT THE FUCK. someone interpret that shit for me. i may like some shitty music sometimes, but i NEVER liked avril lavigne.   is 0 divided by 0, 1? or is it undefined?  and what happened to the "romantic comedy" genre? i don't really care for romantic comedies, but lately all the romantic comedies involve kids in high school. remember when all the romantic comedies somehow involved meg ryan? now the actors keep gettin younger and younger...and they all involve "The big dance" at the end of the movie. so what next? is this shit gonna go into jr. high, and then grade school? are there gonna be 2 hour feature films about boys chasing girls on schoolyards throwing dirt clogs. i mean, i know there's that movie "dodgeball," but i think i saw a bunch of adults in that movie.  hey you wanna hear about my post office excursion today? okay. first here's a little history. i'm a regular at the "P.O." (you like how i said P.O.). well maybe not a regular so much. but i frequent the PO, you could say. yeah and i get helped by the same, middle-aged, bitter, BITTER man, every time. EVERY. TIME. and when i meet people like this, i try to give a lil' extra love, y'know. cuz i don't care who or how you iz, i got love to give. here's a little ditty of how that went: ME (unloading my bag): HEY! you got a mustache since the last time i saw you! HIM: Yeah!hmm..munmblellgurgle..y'nknow..gurgle.. ME: You gotta, y'know, change it up once in awhile... HIM: YEAH,hh,,h,h..hh,.h.mm,.gurg. -----(i just plopped down the first thing)----- HIM: oh i hope this doesn't get all torn apart (this statement seemed      to bring him joy)... ME: yeah, me too. but if it does, i guess that's my fault... HIM: hmmeddur du dru gur mmmeumble... -----(thing 2 is on counter being weighed)----- HIM: oh look at this here we have a little artist here mumble blabmumble... -----(thing 3)----- HIM: oh this one's normal, now that's no fun is it ? ME: huh, no. hey, how much is this thing if i wanna just send it      as a big giant postcard (shows thing 4)... HIM: oh i hope the machines don't tear this thing to shreds, mumble bgurgggrurggmymBLAH! 60 cents... ME: um, can i get some stamps too HIM: oh yeah, now what kindya want, do YOULIKESNAKES? ME: uh, sure. ----that's basically the end, cuz after i paid him he just turned      around and left me there. so i said "uh, have a goodone" and      took-off fastlike.-----  has anyone ever met a midget? have you ever seen one on a plane? or a picture of a midget working a computer? i've never seen images of either. when i say midget, i mean, little person (for all intensive purposes). a couple times there was a family of little people at the hotel...and the counters there are like, 5 feet tall. i shit you not. i had to lean up to that mofo to get average-lengthed people to sign. but anyway, whenever a little person would get into line, all of a sudden, all the clerks would take like, 15 minutes to help the people they were with, when usually we like to spend as little time as possible with a guest. we'd all be SUPER chatty with whomever we were helping, just BEGGING the almighty to spare us the awkward situation, and if we knew it was inevitable, we were just thinking of ways we could get them to sign a register sheet while still being ultra professional. cuz you couldn't just throw it at 'em. and even if you did throw it, they wouldn't have a hard surface with which to write on. unless they got on the floor. i'm done talking about this.

HOLY SHIT I'M A ROBOT>listen to this dream i had. okay kurt cobain and that guy, whatsizname presently of the foo fighters, is in this dream. i don't remember what the hell they were doing there. there was a lioness walking around on her hind legs to prove that she could do anything humans could do, but better than humans. and she was a cocky bitch, lemme tell you. i had to cut myself and drink a bowl of my own blood, and there were these little lion cubs, but they were half-human, and they were sitting in a circle with bowls in front of them, because they also had to cut themselves open and fill the bowl up to drink. this blood thing all had to do with proving that we were able to hunt, or it was some sort of right-of-passage dealy. i told them they didn't have to drink a whole bowl, just about one-anna-quarter cup. how the hell i got that exact measurement and how i became the moderator who decided how much blood was sufficient to drink, who the hell knows. somehow after that i'm thrashing in the middle of the ocean, with a buoy right next to me, but i didn't have any real control over my muscles, so i was just fucking kicking shit and trying not to drown. and then i woke up with anxiety, and all day i've felt like shit.   part of this dream comes from the fact that i've been thinking about how we are a country of teenagers who never got a right-of-passage into adulthood. so all throughout life we're just trying to prove that we're adults. and it shows in the behavior of our government, because just look at this shit. in the scheme of things we are the teenagers, compared to most of the eastern countries of the world, old enough to be our grandparents for chrissakes, whose systems of government have been around WAY before columbus landed and started that whole massive slaughter of the natives. going through that phase of "teen-angst," we always have to get what we want, and if we don't get the approval from our parents we do it anyway to try to prove that we can make our OWN decisions, dammnit, then when shit goes all to hell, we ask the parents for help. hmm..thus begins the long contemplation of "wha happened?" nobody takes the hand they were dealt anymore. they beat up the dealer and take his cards or stack the deck or whatever the fuck i just said. and nobody takes responsibility for their own actions, so we're all just doomed to repeat the same shit, over and over and over again. and i don't think i'm writing this at all in a linear fashion so that it's coherent outside of my own thought processes, but don't you worry about that.   i'm not sure if that has anything to do with having a "right of passage," though. wait, yeah. i think that's my new obsession for the moment. rights of passage. yeah. ancient ceremonies. werrrd.  damn i feel like shit.

      at this time, i'd like everyone to close their eyelids, cover up those interpretive bulbs we call eyes (close them windows to yer soul, child, yer lettin all the cold air out!) and think about your family. next, we begin our sessions on family. i think our relationship is advancing at quite an unprecedented rate. so much do i believe in this statement, that i think we have progressed enough to be able to handle these kinds of discussions...  p.s. ...and although only a percentage of people have a penis...every last one of us, has balls. might i add to this, your honor, that i have some pretty big balls...

      so. tried that whole "dating myself" thing today. what a disaster, let me tell you. it was all about me and myself, we left the third "I," out of it, cuz me and myself had both decided we needed some time alone. and we were thinking of taking the relationship to a different level, y'know? we just wanted it to be the two of us, and to leave I out of it.   first off, myself is pretty laid back, totally passive, a big urban-hippie type. just goes with the flow. seems to get along with everyone, just because myself is so damn passive. BUT. myself SHOWS up at the doorstep, not with flowers, or candy, or any of that other bullshit girls get when they go on dates, but...BEER. myself brings a six pack to the doorstep. at this time, it's cool right, BUT WE HAD THIS TALK...no drinky drinky for me. since the dad's been going in and out of playing the alchy these days, watching this has made me want to remain sober. but whatever. we decide to walk to the train and go into the city, and on the whole ride, myself is totally f*ing groping me and trying to talk all f*ing sweet to me. FUCKER. at this point you can just see me getting pissed.   on top of all of this, I's like, calling us the whole time trying to keep tabs on what myself is doing...just so everyone can get a little perspective on I, I's this total f*ing girlie...a sorority-type chick. super-aggressive. gets what she wants ALL THE TIME. which is fine by me, it's easy to handle being around i because she's hot. but being in front of myself and i all the time gets to be such a pain in the ass because they fight so much. the fighting is something that's easy for me to understand, since they spend all of their time together wrapped in a big clump, unlike me, which is always separated from both of them with a comma: me, myself and i. but the light is starting to be shed on the situation because as what is stated above, i seems to be, all up on myself's shit.   all in all, it can be said that the day wasn't a total waste, we got lost trying to find the movie theater, so we didn't see a movie, but me and myself had fun walking all over town, just talking amongst ourselves (however we couldn't figure out why we kept getting stared at...). it felt even better though, when we were finally ALL together again with the third i.  ...AND... this day finally settled one thing: i should date myself, but it's definitely not gonna be me who does it.

      ....and then today i woke up with nothing to do so i decided to walk around town with my dictaphone and talk nonsense to myself while i was walking. that, my friends, is what people call "multi-tasking." AND WHAT THE FUCK. one of my neighbors installed a fancy new super-sensitive alarm system. oh yeah, does everyone here know that i live about a mile away from o'hare airport? under almost EVERY SINGLE FUCKING FLIGHT PATTERN...yeah...new fancy-pants alarm system goes off every time a plane takes off or lands. money well spent, i do say neighbor.   wait listen this is the written transcript of everything i said to myself. okay but first here's a key to what i'm gonna write: every time there's a new paragraph, that's when i stopped and started the dictaphone. and everything in parenthesis is stuff i'm thinking now, because i always have something to say about everything because i always think i'm so damn smart, so naturally i would have to say something about everything i said in the past, this is in part due to the fact that my opinion changes every 30 seconds. so what i just said there (that past sentence) may not have anything to do with what i'm saying now (being the present-time) or am about to say (which we call "future"), as well as things that i am not thinking about at all and will say something about whether or not it was a topic of conversation at any point in time, including time that has not happened. this is all, of course, considering that time is as we all are living in it, and not the hypothetical non-boundaries of time that do or do not exist. we could also talk about that (time?) right now, but i don't feel like it.  the transcript starts:  whenever i used to get nervous (or actually, whenever i'm not thinking about anything), that michael jackson song, "just beat it" used to play in my head. over and over. but just the bassline. nothing else. now for some reason, i say "everbody in tha club gettin tipsy." over and over. i don't like either of those songs, yet i'm being haunted by them...  i'm turning this on to say that someone just honked at me...  okay. i love the english language. i love words. i love words so much, when i hear one i don't know, i get a dictionary. sometimes i just look at the dictionary to learn new words i might not have encountered otherwise. it's that whole communication thing. i love it. can't get enough. but one word i hate: panty. fucking hate it. get rid of it...  something i hate even more than that is: panty-liner...   i really wish that everytime i hit record, this red light wouldn't go on...  right, i'm carrying around a big fucking rock. because two people just screamed at me from their cars and the next person that screams at me, i'm throwing a rock at...  so anyway, i put the rock down, BECAUSE, i was thinking, "i should have a rock to throw at people if they yell/honk at me," but then as soon as i picked up the rock, nobody honked, so this is the universe's way of keeping me out of trouble (or, umm, people saw you holding a big fucking rock in yer hand...). so i put the rock down, and a cab driver honked...  right now i'm wondering why all the pens in my house don't have caps on them, or they don't have the caps that they were originally assigned to...  should i be thinking of something more prolific than this...  so now i'm walking by my old job and BLAH. i've never had a job before in my life where i didn't want anything to do with the job or the people whatsoever once i was done with the job, i guess i never worked at a place where 600 people were working at the same time, in this huge capsule, where the bosses are bosses and employees are piss-ants...  (singing) "some girls don't wear sweaters," i KNOW. this is how the fucking song GOES. BUT. i don't know the words. so i just made them up. so if anybody has any idea of what the hell i'm talking about, please let me know...  and AND, um, nevermind...  lightning bugs, that's what i wanted to talk about. they're starting to emerge and i LOVE THEM. i want to have their babies...  (edited material. i was talking about things that i love. and how i'm going through an: 'i love america phase,' partly because i haven't seen a picture of george w. in awhile, and partly because i'm not a part of the daily grind right now, and partly because life is always good to me, which of course i'm thankful for. werrrd to the universe, mutha-humpas. and also cuz i was drinking chai, and i was eating licorice, so i was generally just dictating my feelings of lusting after life while getting high on sugar.)  a big lesson i think i need to learn from this life (perhaps the lesson that takes precedence), being born in the ever-fruitful land of america, is temperence...  (then i started rambling on and on about how i think i chose the things i was to accomplish before i became incarnated as a human. i didn't chose the route but i chose the blobs of things i was supposed to do. and how i love everything i've ever had to endure. and how i love every contradicting part of myself that i've created that i have, or have to, learn from.)  if everybody was psychic, would i be able to tell if someone's lying? what if while they weren't psychic, they were a really fucking good liar, would they still be a good liar as a psychic? telepathically conveying LIES? or would everybody just be a fucking ray of light where you can see everone as they are and just accept them and learn what you must from them and move on?...  i still never figured out what was worse, living in ignorance or being aware of what's going on but being powerless to change it...  ------------that was all of the dictation----------------  i think tomorrow i'm gonna get off my ass and take myself on a date to see a movie. the last movie i saw was, umm, lemme poop it out, um, it was with my brother, and um, um, um, it was..AAAAAAAAH..i know which theater, i know exactly where we parked, DAMNIT. what was it? it was actiony. damnit i'll think of it later.

      AH! today i woke up pissed-off. i hate that. i don't have anything to be pissed off at. maybe it comes with the mohawk. hmm. not so much pissed off perhaps, as irritated. like that sound of nails on a chalkboard. so i walked around with my ears peeled back today, eardrums flipped inside out. when my dad started singing chuck mangione, i ran out screaming.   i went dumpster diving at the spring factory by my house. then i stole a bicycle. i wanted a bike with coaster brakes, so i jumped some little kid and took his bike. his mom didn't seem very happy about that. i then rode it over the bridge by the forest preserve, stopped in the middle of the bridge, raised the bike over my head and screamed, "DAMN ALL YOU LUNGLESS CREATURES!" whilst i threw it over the edge. after that i threw myself over the edge, floated for awhile, got out of the river and walked a few miles home. my cell phone doesn't work anymore.   no, that didn't happen.   i walked over the bridge and sat on it looking at the river, debating whether i should jump in. it's over the flood line so i would not have been injured.  had i just one more imaginary friend to egg me on, it would have been so.

      man i think i have to be the most impulsive motherhumper on the goddman planet. i walked my ass into the bathroom. peed. washed my hands. made faces at myself. and then gave myself a mohawk. i did it with an electric mustache trimmer (hey, i have a mustache to trim, it's just not on my face, but it is by my lips, just not the lips yer thinkin of). in my head i'm hearing my mother's voice asking me what kind of job i'm gonna get next. not nagging, because my mom doesn't come straight out and nag. she sneaks around the nagging and asks me a bunch of questions (such as, "so what kind of job are you gonna get in arizona when you get there?") to display her unapproval. i should give her more credit. it's not that she doesn't approve. hell, she may even like it. she worries. she worries so much that i'm not telling her that i'm riding a bicycle to new york until after i do it. then she won't worry the whole time. i already have someone else's mother worried about it so at least one mother is on that shit. yeah this impulsive thing. i impulsively quit my job. a few months ago i impulsively enrolled myself into some techy computer school and then quit (that was cuz i had no money). i impulsively moved to chicago. eh? whaddayagonnado?   i think i may impulsively ride my bicycle to milwaukee. probly not, but right now i'm feelin frisky cuz i just drank a whole lotta coffee. bike rides---> i just finished the mapping of the ride to nueva york. now i have to wait. waiting. still waiting. wai-w-wai-w-wait. the thing i'm worried about is pooing outside. i've never pood outside before. do you just squat like when you pee? is it gonna get on my pants? maybe i'll just hold it the whole way. yeah, and then it'll squirt out my ears. fuck that. i'll just poo into my hands and throw it at cars. like our other little primate counterparts do.   my brother says i'm not patient enough to be a teacher. then i stabbed him in the eye with my judo-ninja-kung-foo-pinky-trick. i think i am. the thing about it, is that he's never seen me in a professional setting. he's only seen me play the role of his little sister. i say, if i can sit through a grown adult whining about how it's too hard to find the thermostat in their hotel room, or some old man screaming obscenities at me cuz we don't have any free hotel suites to put his fat ass in for one night, or some old lady wanting a discount cuz she had to wait 10 minutes in line, and never say no to spoiled fucking middle-aged children, do all of this shit with a smile and a thank you...then i can take some kid busting my chops.   hey i have a question. i just got an amtrak train ticket in the mail. it says that it's valid 01aug04-01jan05. does this mean i don't have to leave on the date that i bought it for? so if i don't get to the station on the 1st of august like i planned, but on the 2nd, then i can take the train on the 2nd?   confusion, it abounds.

      i decided that today i 'm gonna post 5 million postings. i only just decided that because it's 5 am and i haven't gone to bed yet. the life of a recluse is not for the many, just ask buddha. sso, when you meet people, or even when you don't want to meet people, you end up talking to them. and every time the conversation goes for longer than say, 23 minutes, sex is a topic of conversation. and this conversation i've had with myself here on this page has gone longer than that, so i think it's about time we've had the talk about the "birds and the bees" (which i never understood. what does that mean? i never got that talk. someone give me that talk). anyhoo at some point in the conversation i say something like "oh i haven't had sex in a long time." which is true. i haven't had sex since i was 18-19. oh wait, i mean, sex as in, with an outtee. a male. but when it comes to sex in general, i usually go awhile without.  but back to the original topic. when i say this to people, they often wonder how i can go so long. my answer: masturbation. play with yourself. and then people are like "but there's just something about connecting to another human..." well, cuddle with your friends. i like making out best anyway. i'm a make-out slut. the make-out monster. i think the beginning and the end parts of sex are the best. yeah, and when i'm doing it with myself, i know what i want. nobody does it better than i do. i always finish when i do it with myself. i can finish in less than 5 minutes if i want a quickee, i'm that good to me. my point: different strokes for different folks--->ha.literally. yeah and don't try to set me up with anybody. that's another point. whenever i tell people that i haven't had sex in a long time, they start describing people to me that they know who also have not had sex in a long time, who i could eventually have sex with, if i was willing to endure the whole courtship process. if you think about it, two people who haven't done it in awhile wouldn't be all that great in bed. two frantic people, groping for each other's squishy bits. trying to get their own little bundle of nerves tickled.  oh-don't let this post give you the wrong impression. don't get me wrong, i like sex. a lot. but it's weird when people act surprised that i haven't gotten any and am not pursuing any. maybe i should not tell people. maybe i should lie. i'll think about that.

      this is an admission of guilt. i have been watching late night television for the past 10 days, maybe more. i'm not even sure anymore. i have have a pretty good idea when it started, and of course i didn't mean to, but i got hooked. it started with the simpsons at night, and then i just started watching everything that came on after that, even info-mercials. we don't even have cable. and we live in the basement apartment which means that we have, at the most, 3 channels that work at a time (depending on which way the antenna is pointing). and this includes all the channels that don't transmit any english. the channel that always works though, regardless of which wall the antenna is looking at, is the channel that is korean most of the day, sometimes polish and sometimes indian, and mtv2 at night. so i think that anybody who reads this who is totally digusted with the fact that i watch tv, has to have some respect for the fact that i watch beavis and butthead at 3 in the morning. because we're talkin' 'bout my generation here. however, this is not what i came here to discuss. but it is an integral part of what i came here to talk about. okay so there's this commercial that came on, about adoption. and at the end it shows the text; "she gave her son a better life. when she gave him a family." and i was like, "WHOA. you could put that in a song." and then a commercial came on, y'all have seen this one, where a guy is sitting behind a desk talking about bankruptcy: "are you tired of harassing phone calls? do you want the calls to end? is the thought of what you've done in the past haunting your present life?" and then this little hannukah candle lit up in my head and the thought was born "....you could make songs...out of all these commercials...and you could mask the lyrics behind really rockin' music...and maybe a guy with a death-metal voice..." that is FUCKING GENIUS> I AM A GENIUS. this gets better and better, because commercials about car insurance work really good. the dialog from accident lawyers and divorce lawyers. the abstract thought-idea commercials about feminine hygiene and menstruation, work wonders. deodorant commercials and mouth cleanliness commercials work most of the time, you'd have to be selective. think about public service announcements. and if you want a slow jam, use one of those singles hotline commercials. y'know, 1-800-we are 18. and then i was thinking,"it's times like these i wish i spoke spanish."  yeah...what about the dialog from political discussions on PBS? or how about ANYTHING on PBS? actually, and anything on the discovery channel as well(if one had the discovery channel).  YEAH. TOTALLY. all you aspiring musicians who have trouble writing lyrics, hit this up. people sample music, right? and what the fuck, imagine yourself in a world where the next grammy is won by the musician who used that one attorney-at-law who got that one guy 16,000 dollars for his troubles. WERD.

       urlLink    family fun&nbsp; urlLink      AH SHIT! i wrote something and accidentally erased it, which happens all the time to me cuz i hit the wrong thing. but whatever. i am a big nerd. huge. but i'm cool with that. i accept that. i ain't lyin. it's coo. i'm a big nerd cuz it's aboot 3-thirty in the a.m. and i'm not sleeping. i'm playing on the computer. i've been on this thing for like, ten hours today. i'm not even shitting you. or myself. or anybody for that matter. but it's not like i'm rubbing my squishy bits looking at porn. there was only one time i ever tried to find porn on the internet and it was with seneca. we were trying to find an image to make t-shirts out of, and it took us 2 hours to even find the porn. we are not porntastic. and besides, i was getting maps and cutting maps and pasting maps. now when i close my goddamn eyes, all i see are lines and dots.  yeah well look at this picture, lemme tell you all aboot this picture. take the grrl on the right. that's me. she's dumb. i hear she spends like, 10 hours on the internet and if you ask me that's LAME. that big lug to the left of me is my bro. he's tall. and the white guy to the left of him is my cousin bill(y). yep, i am a descendant of a long, LONG line of white folk. super white. freckly white. pearly white. off-white.

      i decided i am going to be a school teacher. yes, indeed i am. summer is my favorite season. i love being all sweaty and burnt to a bloody crisp. so i want summers, weekends, and all government holidays off. AND...i would feel like i was doing some good in the world. i would teach all the little bastards i ever get in charge of that it's cool to be a FREAK from the planet FIZ-UNK (someday i'll explain that).   so anyway being the jobless hoodlum that i am i've had all this pure, unadulterated time to think about the meaning of my existence. which, i'll have you know, i'm well on my way to answering, and i'm doing a damn good job answering it, SUCKAS, and when i have the answer, i won't tell anybody. i'll sell it in a book under an assumed name and i'll call myself: Guru Sanjay Ranasan Maya Love You Long Time Rhinocerus Tyranasaurus Rex Mooner Gemini Call Me A Trip And I'll Say I'm A Vacation Yoo Eep-Who Yoo Drink Pepsi (i'll only add the last two names after i get a buttload of money to be a spokeperson-cuz it's all aboot gettin paid).  this. all of this contemplative future business, comes about because of the last time i saw me grandpa. G-PA. the original "G" to me. the man i was scared shitless of as a child. my mom had to force me to hug him. he was a man's man. didn't talk. sat in his chair in front of the television during family visits. never said "i love you," or even showed any sort of affection towards his blood relatives, or any other human. he did on occasion, but it was rare. BUT. you KNEW he had your back, knew he loved the shit out of you, but you just never wanted to fuck with him or piss him off. he'd say stuff like, "so, you wanna meet Mrs. Fist and her five daughters?" and his LOOK. that fucking STARE. i thought my mom shot lasers out of her eyes, but the G shoots fucking heat-sensored government-issued invisible rays of DEATH. never let him see you finagling with shit you shouldn't be finagling with. he'll give you his look, and you'll die.   BUT, the last time i saw him was like, june 5th, around the time of my aunt melanie's wedding. and every time i see him he gets farther and farther from being alive, and it makes every word that comes out of his mouth and into my brain leave an impression. his words are beginning to act like his death-stare. the day i saw him he was sitting in the breakfast nook of his house, i was standing in the hallway underneath the entry and he looks at me and says "you should be a professional tinkerer. you should be yer own boss, nobody would tell you what to do. you like messing with all kinds of things, you should do it as a profession. you won't make much money at first but you'll like it." and i was like, "holy shit that's true, cuz i know a little about tons of things..." and then my brother says, "yeah and a lot aboot nuthin." which is THE TRUTH. i ain't lyin'. but my grandpa then kept goin on about how i was a "free spirit, nobody can get ahold of you...yer smart for not gettin married...."  a few minutes later we were by ourselves in the same position as before, and he sez something like, "you just need to sit back, close yer eyes, and think about what you wanna do......and get high when you do it." my immediate thought--->WHAT?! did you all read the above descriptive paragraph of my grandfather? no FUCKING WAY DID HE SAY THAT. and i wasn't sure he said it, and even now i'm contemplating whether or not he said it, because with the way he talks and the jumbling from his speech it kinda sounded like, "and don'tget high when you do it (don'tget as one slurry word)." after he said that i choke out a "WHAT?!?! did you say 'get high,' or 'don't get high.'" he just started laughing though and didn't answer cuz my brother and co. came in after that. damn. that whole thing blew my fucking mind. if you hang on, i'll tell you about my gram-ma-mama. like that song, it was a hip-hop song, ca't remember who it's by: "make 'em say UHH...na-NA-na-NA." i call my gramma gram-AH-ma-AH. or just gramam-uh.

      so when i was riding my bike to the store today i was cruisin by this catholic church in the neighborhood and i see this REALLY old polish guy wacking the yard of the church to shreds with one of those hand-held thingees. i forget what they're called (weed wacker, perhaps?) but you wave it around for the corners/edges of the yard. that made me laugh, and then as i rode on i saw this other old polish guy (chicago has the second largest population of polish people, right behind, um, Poland, you ass) on this super-rad badass old skool 3 speed rustycrusty cruiser, stopped on his bike, staring AGHAST SHOCKED STUNNED DISGUSTED at this statue of mary in the lawn. the thing aboot the statue was that it was wrapped in bubble wrap and taped, hostage-style. THAT. made me laugh so hard i ran into a curb. it was the kind of thing that probly could've made it into the chicago museum of contemporary art, based on what i saw yesterday, and with all of the implications you can make with a bubble-wrapped statue of mary, the mother of you-know-who (see feminist, esp. traditional views of women and their obligations to church/home/motherhood/marriage/child-rearing/ etc.)  mary, the mother of plastic wrap. seen and unseen, gentle blanket and slow but blatant asphyxiater of heaven and earth. official preservative of the last supper. don't let that leftover bread and wine go to waste! keep rodents and insects off the kosher goods!   i think i'll start going back to church.  and then i thought aboot how absolutely fucking crazy it is, two people looking at the same thing, getting different shots of different chemicals from the brain into the system, creating different chemical reactions. crazy. the same catalyst, the same blob of chemicals = different outcome. nuts to science. we are all fools, anyway.  HOLY SHIT> oh yeah i figured out the reason why i felt like shit the last coupla days, it's that whole monthly release of extra uterine lining. it's weird. i get jobless and i lose track of time and i'm getting hurled through the universe, and then i forget aboot all those human obligations i have to fulfill while being human.

      my dad. he's funny. listen to this: my dad is a short little old asian man. when i say short i mean, i'm aboot 5-foot-4-inches and he's an inch or two shorter. when i say old i mean, goin on 65. when i say asian, i mean he's pinoy. he lays on the filipino accent pretty hard, AND, think about that on top of the language part of his brain that wsa destroyed by a blood clot a few years ago.   when he drinks a lot of coffee, you can tell.  i woke up in the early afternoon today (jobless by choice). i was reaching for the coffee and in comes pops, with his fast e.t. style walk, all hopped-up on caffeine, trying to tell me about his visit to the hardware store. and when i say "tell me," i mean, in asian style. y'know how everybody's seen that quiet, cute, pale little asian girl. seems so innocent. and then you hear her speaking in her native asian language to her family, like "YA-YA-WONG-PU-SUN-ME..." and so on. like, that shit is LOUD. well, my dad speaks like that in english too. and i just woke up and he's like " THE ACE HARDWARE Y'KNOW THE KOREAN GUY I SAID 'YOU HAVE SWORD PROTECTOR' AND THE KOREAN GUY SAID 'HUH?' AND I SAY 'YOU HAVE A SWORD PROTECTOR' AND KOREAN SAYS 'OH! YOU MEAN SORJZ PROTECTOR...." so on, so on. yeah and my dad was talking about a "surge protector," by the way. and my dad is addicted to buying things like shelve kits and then he doesn't read the instructions. so he ends up with something slanted forward and a whole bag of leftover parts. so he has to nail it to the wall. that's part of my dad.

      okay today or maybe i should say, right now, i am reverand funk. i just read through a bunch of people's blogs, and i have no idea why people actually write about the things they did that day. YAY! i went to the bank and then i went to poo-poo's house YAY! and then i went home but not before i went to school YAY!. dumb. i'll end up doing that someday, i bet. cuz i'm a hypocrite.....ahh...  listen to this though. i just watched some of what the kids are callin "tv" and one of those "truth" commercials came on. well maybe it's not one of those but it's one where some kid is about to have an intervention with another kid who kid one thinks is developing some sort of nasty habit. what i'd like to say is, is that i have a lot of experience with addicts. of all sorts. physical drug things are not the only addictions. negative emotional relationships are an addiction. food is an addiction. repetitious behavior. damn. i guess you can say that my addiction is collecting fucked-up humans. some people have their stamps, some people collect those new quarters...i collect emotional/physically distressed people.  okay yeah and what i wanted to say is that what i've learned is that you can't fucking harp on an addict day and night. they have to want the help. maybe you can bring their attention to the shit they get themselves in, but after that point you just have wait for them to ask you for help. i used to get myself WAY involved and just fucking watch these people destroy themselves. i kept getting in the way of the addiction for a week or so of their lives trying to distract them from doing crazy shit. i was taking on their shit, because i actually thought i was doing good. now what i do is i just stop talking to them until they ask, "why don't you talk to me anymore," and then i just say, "cuz yer a fucking drunk/junkie/pothead," or the famous, "cuz i think yer a slut." then they either stop talking to me altogether, or we work it out. that's some friendship, right there bruthas and sistas.  ah, no more preachy preachy.

      poop on everybody, just poop on yourself. do it now. today is a day, just like yesterday. i'm making a map for bike riding to new york, so i don't know why i decided to create a blog. i am such a bastard to myself. i made myself wear a blond wig while i was making love to myself last night. i really need to get myself more self esteem, then maybe i could stand up to myself when i try to bully me into doing things that are humiliating. the point is, even though there is no politeness in pointing, is that i can't be do-da-ing on this shit when there's other shit to attend to.  no, let's start with different beginnings, cuz we can do that. okay. one time you were on a train, you were drunk, and you fell asleep (hey, yer s'posed to be imagining you're me, hookers). you woke up in the underground airport terminal, which is the end of the line. you walked fast-like, the walk where you are just about to run, the one where yer ass sticks out real funny like you done got something stuck up in it, the walk where you should actually just give up and run, because you look more like an ass than if you were just RUNNING, doing the fast-no-i'm-too-damn-cool-to-run-like-a-tourist-with-a-hawaiian-shirt-on-what-a-fashion-faux-pas-ooh-is-that-alec-baldwin? wait. yeah. you were in a hurry, so to speak, because you had to pee real bad. but you walked out of the train and in your head you KNEW where the fuck you were but the physical part of you hadn't caught up yet so you were screaming "WHERE THE FUCK AM I?!" holy shit i've never fallen asleep on a train before. FUCK! but the hurry was mostly in a rush to find a bathroom to empty the bladder. when you left the restroom the accomplice that had gotten drunk with you was speaking with a man from the planet uranus. REALLY> he sez he was from uranus. i sez, "hey, i'm from the planet funk!" nothing else was said then because we got back on the train.  hey but WAIT, the uranusian was not done with the conversation, so he follows us onto the train and starts asking you if you remember the specifics of the planet funk, because he knows he's from uranus and he was born into a human body in detroit to get circumsized and vaccinized(-ated?) and he couldn't remember what all else about uranus. maybe it wasn't uranus he was from, maybe it was neptune. for the sake of the humor value of the word "uranus," we will use "uranus." we will use it like "uranus" was meant to be used. but don't worry "uranus" will be fine. we will not abuse. so anyway he also said he came to be mariah carey's limo driver and lover. he made love to her every night at 11pm. more later. am i missing anything?

      my parents are super avid enthusiasts for um, cremation. no really, i have this conversation every so often with my mom. she HATES funerals, she sez, "just burn me and throw me somewheres. if people want to see me, they have to see me alive. no wake, no nuthin. just a church service."   so when medical professionals ask you what your directive is and if you have one, it's the extent to which you want to be revived or hooked up to tomfoolery in the hospital, written out by a lawyer and notarized. it gives you all these options and you initial the ones you want, like, "i would like to go so far as to have one tube shoving the nutrients in one end, and another tube pulling the leftovers out of the other end. please do not get my ends mixed up" i read my stepdad's today, he wants no such thing. neither does me ma. they want none of that. NONE OF IT, THEY SAY! pull the plug, DO IT NOW!   hmmm...read this:   okay so you wake up, and the day is the same as the same as the same as the day beforethat beforethat before. tony's on the couch, staring vacantly out of the back patio door (what is he thinking of?). you walk into the kitchen, grazing for food. you see him get up, not very certain of himself, hovering towards the bathroom, reaching for stability with the wall, and you think, "hmmm, that does not look like a healthy walk," but yer opening and shutting the refrigerator and pantry door. you turn on and turn off the faucet of the sink. then you hear the sound of a hand slapping a wall and smearing towards the ground. after that comes the sound of a body hitting a carpeted floor. when you run to this body, you say stupid things like, "what's goin on? did you just pass out?" tony is totally delirious (he hasn't eaten in a coupla days, he barely keeps his fluids, and he's been sleeping all day for 3 days), he is bobbing and weaving in and out of consciousness with every blink of his eyes, and this is what he mumbles, delirious-style, "i was just helping myself to the floor."   you bastard. you funny stubborn old man.   my mom wakes from a dead sleep when she hears him fall. we call 9-11 and wait for an ambulance. waiting for an ambulance is miserable. his body is steaming, he is feverish. chemotherapy kills everything in your body, even the white blood cells. so he has some sort of infection that's making him feverish. it feels like his soul is rising with the steam from his body. i am mentally pushing it/forcing it back in. he shifts to get into a more comfortable position on the ground, and underneath him you see the consequence of not making it to the toilet on time, seeping through the carpet.   &nbsp;tick tock count the seconds fungame to play while waiting. la la la. OOoo...sirensscreaming.   the stubborn guy almost refuses to go to the hospital. he insists on stumbling around the bathroom to clean himself up before going.   yeah, and when did paramedics start asking for insurance cards? what happens next, "oh, and how will you be paying for this ma'am? cash or credit? how about we get that second mortgage on your house started? because in all reality, that's what it's gonna cost."    now i am sitting in a private emergency room. he gets moved into a private&nbsp;in the emergency room because his white blood cell count is .05% of the normal rate. and there's lots of bugs he must hide from in the ER. i have a particle mask on. i'm staring at the pulse in my wrist. if i move it a little, the pulse moves to my thumb and i can stare at that. this is another game to play. i'm breathing in and out, making sure he does it with me, pretending i'm psychic, trying to make him fall asleep. i can't handle that vacant stare. i really want to know what you are seeing/thinking in your head. why is just one eye open? your eyes are swimfloating in your head, tony. you can fall asleep, i can breathe for you. don't worry, i got it covered. when you dream, i hope you dream about all the things you can't eat. fuck those steak and potato fiends, you're a steak and lobster man. you eat the richest foods. you're italian for chrissakes, EH! aaAAH...and MOM! where are you i can't handle this i'm not strong enough for this where the HELL ARE YOU?! feeding the dog cannot possibly take this long how many people are you calling what the hell is going on FUCK please don't tell me you got into a car accident please don't tell me some mass-fucking-murderer was waiting for you on the one day in my entire life i feel like i can't handle my own shit. he pood himself again he asked for a nurse and i have to beg one motherfucker to come in here to take him to the shitter to take his vitals to clean his sheets. "oh, i'm not a nurse"...well sorry you look like a nurse and okaythenFINE...of the 400 people working here which one of you IS a nurse? "oh, i'm not HIS nurse, go walk to the station all the way on the other side of this floor one of them is HIS nurse." FUCK! i'm walking around here with a creepy mask on, every other patient/family member on this floor is staring at me while i'm walking back and forth stop looking at me i'm not your fucking savior i have nothing you need and i can hear a woman wheeping "NO!, NONOOONO!..." probably for some poor dead motherfucker and there's an old guy screaming for a glass of water and cussing out a nurse about having to put on the backless gown and some woman is wretching and vomitting as LOUD AS FUCKING POSSIBLE JESUSFUCKINGCHRIST put a fucking lid on that noise i've never vomitted that FUCKING LOUD in my LIFE so WHY THE HELL SHOULD YOU?!!?   oh. i saw you earlier...you must be his nurse.   me say, "blahblahblah he poo..."  she say, "i'll go get someone."   OH. fuckthat. FUCK. THAT. (be calm.just wait.) she puts a towel on the bed and says, "he's moving in about 20 minutes anyway so i'm just gonna put a towel down over this." 2 hours later, he gets moved. must be fun lying in your own excrement waiting for the 2nd time in one day. this must be what all those 3rd world countries are talkin' bout.   after the move into a normal hospital room, things are calmer. emergency rooms are not fun. if you asked me to define the opposite of fun, or maybe if you say something like, "hmm, find an antonym for the word 'fun'," i'd say, "emergency room." hands down. no contest.   his nurse rattled off the names&nbsp;for a buncha&nbsp;prescription drugs that he might be taking that they give chemo patients for that anti-diarrhea, anti-nausea, fresh feeling. because my mother and i can't think of the names of his meds off of the top of our heads. and i wonder which pharmaceutical company this hospital deals with. because i don't recognize any of what she says, so she must not be trained in the ways of the competing pharmaceutical company, with whom tony's oncologist (cancer specialist) may be dealing with. she may have said something with the exact molecular formula as what he takes, just made by a different company.   oh well. go big business! money kills.   i am here now. after a 12 hour hospital waiting marathon. i am watching this thick, dense cloud that's looming over me. it's waiting for me, but it should know better.

      ... is my favorite grouping of words for this here blogmoment.&nbsp; it comes from a chat with katie o. she's psychic. she made me pick my nose by telepathic suggestion while we were chatting. what, you say? yeah, i said that too. you had to be thurr. raht thurr...  so it seems weird moods are to be had by all this fine evening. i just had three conversations with 3 different people that all somehow corresponded with each other. the timing within the system that's my life within this human spectrum is starting to synchronize with itself completely. which fucking rox my sox, SUCKAAAZ. life begins and it ends at the same time. so what are you gonna do, really?  i'm in this phase where i call everyone sucka, SUCKA, so bear with me.  okay so juss lissennn.... everything, every goddamn repetitive negative behavior starts at one point. maybe the universe, maybe that starts at one point. who knows? but just think of that one point. maybe you're that one point. put yourself there. then someone throws a stone in your pond, and it ripples, and the energy perpetuates itself. picture an atom with the nucleus at the center, electrons behaving around it. at your center, one action you commit on another human begets that same action being committed on another, maybe two or three. you are at the center and you now have these rings around you, this kinetic field of energy. getting grander, larger, growing exponentially but not full enough to form an equation to grasp, now just imagine if one barrier, one whole generation of people, knew what was going on? it doesn't matter where it started really (but where the fuck did it start?), but if one ring of people were to see what was happening and stop perpetuating the negative behavior, how fucking beautiful is that (sucka)?   i'm talkin bout this cuz i was talking to (insert any name here). and we analyzed our's and other's repetitive behaviors. how one beats around the bush innocently, how another forgets to beat the bush completely until&nbsp; it gets too late and the bush gets whacked accidentally, how one beats around the bush more sneakily than every one else, just hoping someone catches them beating around the bush, how yet another beats around the bush so much that they are lost in what they are doing...did i miss anything? we were just talking about different levels of insecurity people have, and what repetitive behavior they experienced/inherited that made the behavior start.  i've been such a joykill lately. i'm not sorry.  in other news, we need to talk. we need to talk so much we will talk until we puke. we'll hate talking after we're all done with each other. i can't wait.  yeah, and i just started this new repetitive behavior. or, i just realized something i do: whenever people talk to me, and they say something grammatically incorrect, i'll say "what?" or maybe to be more dramatic, "what the hell did you just say?" i know what they're talking about, but if it came out wrong, i ask them to say it again so that they either say it correctly, or explain it. i'm not sure why i do this. but it doesn't apply to people who have accents, foreign or domestic. and then i realized that i just want people to understand each other, i mean , what the fuck? i know what the hell you just said but if you say that to someone else, like maybe your mother, she won't get it. i'm all about communication, suckaz, i'm a communication station.

      ARGH! how do i feel? how the HELL, DO&nbsp; I FEEL, ANYWAY? wow, you can read that two different ways. everything is up to interpretation. lemme just start rambling, and then just let me not stop for awhile.   do not perpetuate the things in this world that you hate. this is one rule.   my parents do this thing, where they are super aggressive. and they are always right. i think we call that stubborn. maybe something else. maybe aggressively stubborn. incredibly stubborn? i love them, but it's hard not to fall into the routine of aggressive stubbornness.   sometimes i do this thing, where i am not myself. when i've been all by my lonesome for awhile, i realize how much nothing i am really exists. this purgatory, albeit place of learning i am in, i am done with. it's time to get out.&nbsp;  i feel all of my molecules starting to gather momentum moving towards some different place, but i haven't caught up yet...hey guys...wait up.   what was i talking about? oh yeah existing. not really existing. so am i product of the people around me? this is not what i wanted to talk about. but this past year when i've lived a million miles away from where i lived before, i learned about myself. yep.&nbsp; i could start by saying that, or i could just say something else. ahem. yeah. i need to remember to be comfortable. i think that's a part of it. i think i need to remember to be honest with myself. i think i need to remember not to neglect things i am feeling, or actually, i shouldn't fake like i'm feeling something else. this is where my problem lies. if i have one problem, i'd say that's what it is. i don't allow myself to express that i feel. i need to open myself up and learn how to feel things. and then when i'm done learning that, i can shut myself back up.  is that being selfish? i know people that feel things, ALL THE TIME>and&nbsp; i think that what they are feeling is way better than what i feel, so taking up space/time/energy by throwing my own emotions into the world mix instead of keeping them in my own head is just a waste of human resources.   i know for a fact that emotions can be totally mde up. one emotion i've almost completely thrown out because it wastes space is jealousy. that shit is all one fictional show you put on for yourself in your head. that's one totally useless emotion. but it's also the one emotion that can show how creative you can be with your imagination.   am i just settling into this human body i've somehow acquired?  i need to remember perspective, i think every one should remember perspective. &nbsp;so where did you come from? i don't understand people that i've met 5 minutes ago, telling me a million personal things that i think you shouldn't be telling strangers. i like these stories, and i'm not asking them to stop, but i don't get it. then i think, are you lonely? what happened to you that got you into the hole where you need to grasp at the walls, trying to get a hold of any other human being on the planet to pull you out? maybe sometimes it is good to talk to an objective source for a different point of view.  ugh, who am i kidding?

SWEET.   remember that time when i started the faux hawk, and pseudo socks? &nbsp;I SWEAR!   i'm about to go bike riding, because i'm a glutton for pain. i'll tell you about it later.

      this is the post where i talk to myself and you don't listen. this is the list of things that i need to get done the next time i get to arizona. i would write them on paper, but i would lose the paper. and if i don't write them down i'm gonna keep repeating them in my head until i go crazy.   1) hang with Tarah. HEY TAR-ARGH! i'm coming in the 30th instead of the 31st now. i'm going to attack you, and maybe yer family. this is your final warning. sorry i didn't call you back today, i'm an ass. OH! and congratulations on your new high-profile kick-ass job. we should wrestle.  2) sign up for late-start internet classes.  3) learn how to drive a vehicle that does not shift gears by itself  4) get an arizona i.d. (i actually don't have to do this now, but i may have to if i have to re-register at Mesa Community College)  5) configure the room i'm gonna live in. build a bed. once upon a time, i had the best bed in the world. it was like, 4 feet off of the ground.&nbsp;a part of the foundation was an old dresser, so all of my shit went into the dresser and under the bed. it was also a good hideout from my then roommate. and fort. i slept there sometimes. so i'm gonna re-create this masterpiece, only it's gonna be better. all of my clothes will&nbsp;hang underneath. and there will be a tent there as well. HEY! the room i live in&nbsp;cannot only be JUST a room, it must be an experience, an escape pod of sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp;i must love it fully and completely, and i must find different, new and exciting ways to sleep in it once in awhile. so poo on yoo. why must i do this now, you ask? cuz when i move into this room permanently in september, i only want to worry about finding a job. i don't want to worry about moving all sorts of shit around. stop asking so many questions, yer not sposed to be reading this anyway.  OY. all of this, of course, depends on that tricky, double-faced bee-atch: time.

      hi, yeah, how are you? here's that poem i wrote you:  forget yer toothpaste and yer fluoride, mouthwash that shit out...  don't wash the potty mouth with soap,  put some chlorine in it.  shit.  gimme chlorine, bromine tabs...  chew it, don't swallow though.   no need to scrub yer calcium with plastic bits.  swish..  chlorine, bromine,  suck it from a hose...  you knows.   have it yer way,  get the bugs out,  SPIT!  but keep me out of it.   ((((END))))   HA! yeah i was thinking of that&nbsp;while i cleaned out my parent's backyard fountain today. my genius mind (and i'm such a goddamn genius, mind you) decided the best thing to do would be to siphon the water out. so i found some hoes (like, 2 or 3) and we cleaned that shit out. and my mom said at one point, "SUCK BUT DON'T SWALLOW," which my 12-year-old permanent mindset couldn't stop laughing at. yeah, so i sucked on the hose, and i got bugs, algae, and chlorine all up in mah grill.   my parent's dog pooped right in front of where i was gonna walk today, and then he turned around and stared at me. and then he walked away. what am i sposed to make of that? i thought he loved me...   here are some suggestions:   -if you decide to go on a long distance bike ride, don't do it when it's say, 107 degrees outside, and there are no clouds. esp. in the middle of the afternoon. you will die.  -if you decide that you must, in fact, go on a long distance bike ride in the middle of the afternoon when it's a million degrees out, when putting on sunscreen, don't forget to put it on the back of your hands too. or else you will end up looking like an ass.   i hate water. i'm not sure why. except for the ocean. and i hate bathing. but today i took the hottest bath in the world, and then rinsed off with the coldest water in the world. why did i do that? it wasn't fun.&nbsp;and why am i obsessed with building a boat out of cardboard if i hate water? lately i've been thinking that building a cardboard boat and throwing around a frozen turkey would be the funnest things to do. EVER. and i want to jump naked off of the roof of the house i'm about to move into.   do i just need a hug? will that solve my problems?   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

GROSS.  &nbsp; and my neck isn't working right. it hurts.  &nbsp; YOU! go eat poo. DO&nbsp;IT! &nbsp; if you loved me you would...wait. i hate that.&nbsp;ew. forget i said it. &nbsp; but you should do it anyway, or...you should throw around a turkey and tell me how it went. &nbsp; wait, i had this dream i went to visit a friend, and i decided to leave instead of stay with the family, remember that. it was different from the dream that i woke up in the middle of.  &nbsp; is it grammatically proper to end a sentence with the word "of?"  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      this dreaming business has gotten seriously out of control.&nbsp;i had this dream about&nbsp;neon-green glowing aliens taking over. i was in&nbsp;a basement and i couldn't find a gun, i was with these 2 guys who had guns, and they just hid me in some curtains. so i waited there for some sort of struggle, but the aliens actually turned out to be nice. okay next i'm walking down a city street, like the part of lawrence ave. in chicago that's korean, and there's humans and neon green aliens co-existing. but the humans could choose to be aliens if they wanted. like by way of plastic surgery or some shit. EXCEPT, the aliens communicated telepathically, and if you were a human who decided to become an alien, you couldn't fully communicate as telepathically as the aliens. like, you knew that telepathic shit was going on, but you couldn't quite grasp it cuz it happened too fast and yer brain couldn't process it. so. i was still human and for some reason i didn't trust the aliens so i kept all these repetitive thoughts running subconsciously in my brain so that whenever they were trying to tap into what i was thinking they heard all this shit that was boring, but underneath the layer of false thought were my real thought processes. i didn't want them to know that i didn't trust them. and then i was walking down the littwin's street only the road was wider, and i picked up an m&amp;m wrapper. it was the size of wrapper that you get when trick or treating, um, sample portioned or whatever. and on it, it said m&amp;m's, but the small print was different, like, it turned you into an alien whether or not you wanted to be one. or maybe it tricked you into becoming an alien but you just ended up being a stupid alien, like an alien servant or something. then i picked up a skittles wrapper that was the same sample-sized portion, but the small print indicated that the inside of your mouth turned into a circuit board so that you could inconspicuously download instructions from the mother ship from computers on earth. i know, really, just listen though. i wasn't sposed to have seen either of these, but i end up eating the skittles and the inside of my mouth grew those bus lines on computer circuit boards.  &nbsp; okay so then i'm in an apartment building because i feel like i need to hide, and i see this little alien girl, and she wants to play. so i'm like, okay. so i end up baby-sitting her and she's showing me all these board games and toys and stuff and i see a computer. but then i look down at my wrist and i see this crazy tattoo, it looked like the artwork on the newest radiohead album. except there were pictures of aliens that you couldn't see unless you looked REALLY close. and i say out loud, "when the hell did i get this tattoo?" and the girl sez, "oh your friends tricked you into getting it when you were really drunk the other night." (WHAT? yeah, stop. just listen) so i go to the computer and i'm looking around and all of a sudden the screen turns all swirly and there's like, a miniature tornado on the screen. and i know that i'm downloading all this information but i don't know what it is, like the alien objective or some shit. but the colors were CRAZY. it was nuts... &nbsp; can someone say alien abduction? &nbsp; &nbsp;

      or so my mom says. actually, it's more like: &nbsp; ma:&nbsp; "you smell, go take a shower." me:&nbsp; "but i'm wearing normal deodorant." ma:&nbsp; "i don't care, you still smell." &nbsp; that shit is funny. i'm such a hippy. i need a hippy job. i need a job telling people how cool they are. i could TOTALLY do that. i love telling people how cool they are. and i do it all the time because all the friends&nbsp;i have right now&nbsp;are so goddamn cool.&nbsp;i'm so fucking lucky it's ridiculous. and i have a mother that will remind me when it's time to shower so that i can function within normal society. &nbsp; i can tell my stepdad is getting better, because he's started talking a lot.&nbsp;when he and my mother converse, regardless of the subject matter, just remember that they&nbsp;are both right ALL THE TIME.&nbsp;i can feel it&nbsp;starting to bother me. but thank the universe for that. they are both&nbsp;so stubborn, and right now i love it. and appreciate it. my parents are so weird but this scene is something i'm in love with right now. i can't explain it really. but it makes sense to me. YA. &nbsp; the soundtrack to my life right now is the soundtrack to the Royal Tannenbaums (care of chrys, fuck DUDE YOU ARE SO COOL, THANK YOU). the five cds i have right now: 1)&nbsp; (the above-mentioned) 2)&nbsp; Maroon 5 3)&nbsp; the newest Daft Punk 4)&nbsp; the essential Herbie Hancock 5)&nbsp; Rage Against the Machine (this is not mine, i have no idea who the hell it belongs to) &nbsp; i wanted a right of passage, and here i am.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      HA! that's funny. i still want to throw a thanksgiving turkey around. but only if i can steal it, and only if at one point, it gets thrown off the roof of something (i.e. a building, house, or moving car). funny, at first i just wanted to throw around a turkey, now i attached all these conditionals to it. oh well.  the 16th was my mom's birthday. some fucking birthday. you figure it out. AND we found out my grandpa was just recently in the hospital. happy 49, mom (49=7x7, 7/7=1, or 0, or 2, or 3, or is undefined). this living thing, it sure is a hoot.   i know someone out there is gonna use me, so STOP it. i hate getting used. and it'll ruin the friendship. and it could've been such a beautiful friendship, too. being selfish has it's benefits and can be a therapeutic tool for self-healing, but that shit can get out of control when you hurt other people and when everything in your life just revolves around yourself all the time. life will get better when you start giving. and not just physical stuff, fucking give yourself once in awhile, SUCKA. and when you're giving yourself, forget about yourself. i don't even think you know it, though. you don't even see what the hell i'm talking about. either that, or you think you're being sneaky and scandalous, which appeals to you. i don't think you see the repetitive negative behavior in your life and relationships that you need to stop. i'm already mourning the loss of the friendship we never fully realized. how sad.   be here now. so i guess that's over with.  when i was in my teenager part of life, i remember making an all-call out to the universe for my people. and it worked. and i promised myself i would never keep people in my lives that i don't see a positive connection with (or click completely with, or whatever you say). i mean, i get on well with everyone cuz i know how, but i'm not all there with everyone. sometimes i lie to myself and wish the thing that wasn't there really was (in regards to that second part). but for the most part, i done good.   i just need not be a sucker anymore. i can't let myself be guided into situations i really don't feel good about or want to be in. so don't try to push me when i say no. cuz i'm not joking.  with love,   master poop one  JUST POO IT!

      DUDE! i feel like throwing a wrapped turkey around a grocery store. actually, i feel like stealing a turkey and throwing it off the roof of a building. i should do that when i get to arizona. wait, turkeys don't fly. maybe tofurkey does.   f*ing las vegas is DRRTY, have i mentioned that already? everywhere you go it reeks of piss. and there's trash everywhere. not just trash though, ancient remnants of articles of trash with caked-on desert claydirt ...dirty trash. all those apocalyptic dreams i used to have has lead me to this particular juncture of time and space. which accessorizes the feeling that all of the possible kinds of histories i could have lived would have all lead up to this point. which in turn&nbsp;means that the rest of the history i make is completely and utterly up to me.  &nbsp; sweet.  &nbsp;  i went bike riding today and got caught in a big thunderstorm. it was nice. it made me want to find the ocean to jump in and cleanse myself. the air got cleaner. which meant that the color of the water in the curbstreams ranged from a coffee-saturated&nbsp;urine to a deep dark thick lager.  &nbsp;  cancer is going good. chemotherapy. funtimes. my mom said some lady crapped herself in the chemo clinic. wow, wish i was there. tony got 2 hours of chemo, came home feeling like a champ so he ate a bunch of food too fast and threw it up into the kitchen sink cuz it got caught in his esophagus. they fed him a ton of anti-nausea meds with the chemo so at least he's not puking because of that as well. woo-hoo. poetry in motion. remember that.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      okay i'm getting to some healthier next step. i've taken myself out of the realm of emotions. which is good. learning. yeah.  for anyone who knows me, yall should know that i'm generally scared of old people. and that i don't consider any of my family members as old people. just other old people. so we were in the chemotheropsolopticalicy (er whatever) clinic today and i ask to use the restroom. the nurse gives me directions and i walk through this long antiseptic hallway and into this stale white boxroom with windows. the walls are lined with comfy chairs, the kinda chair that every family has one of. y'know the main chair that sits in the living room in front of the television set. and cocooned in each one of these chairs is an old person hooked up to an IV. some more cocooned than others. some older and more wrinkly than others. talk about living a fucking nightmare. i narrowly escaped.  so about dreaming, every time i fall asleep i dream like a fiend. i had a dream about bike riding all night and day and into a korean karaoke bar. and the koreans in there started laughing at me, but i understood what they were saying. then getting kicked out of a produce place, and all i wanted to do was buy some dates. i was so excited because the produce there was so good. i got kicked out by all the orchestra nerds i knew in high school. they tried to judo-chop my ass. and they said i could never shop there again, which i was sad about, cuz it was the best produce place i've ever seen.   here in the LV it's dirty. SUPER FUCKING DIRTY. it sucks to breathe. whilst living in chicago i forgot about bloodynose dry desert smog breathing. and the lack of clouds or rain. or moisture. or houses separated by 7-foot concrete block walls. and 4 lane roads in suburbs with SUVs marching updownup. and strip malls. modern-day desert dwelling. i made a vow today that i must finish school and get out of the desert permanently within 5 years.   from what i've observed so far, stomach cancer fucking sucks. tony's alien fetus is lodged in the area where the stomach connects to the esophagus. so it's crushing his esophagus, making eating that much more of a bitch. he eats a small meal, using small bites and he has to chew like a sumbitch. then sits at the table while his stomach and esophagus decide whether or not what has been ingested is acceptable. this is REALLY painful. if they don't like the food, he pukes it up. if they like the food, it still fucking hurts. tomorrow he starts chemo. oy.   so i've only been here a few days but i'm trying to mentally coerce my stepdad into eating raw soup. he's a little too proud right now to eat blended vegetables, but i think if he sees me doing it he's gonna ask to try it. TONY YOU NEED FUCKING VITAMINS DAMMIT. he's such a fucking tough guy type. he's been feeling super shitty since he left the hospital, but the reason he was feeling good in there was because they were hydrating him and vitaminizing him through tubes. goddamnit. he doesn't realize this consciously, so i'll have to pull some ninja psychic coercion tactics on his ass. they told him to drink that Ensure crap. but it's all sugarized and lactized. which makes the vitamins wrapped inside of the sugary milk hard to get to.  poop on that, i say.  i want to talk about something else, but where to begin?

      i just woke up again. hi, i've just had a 16 hour sleepday and boy am i famished.   i feel very disonnected. i'm hoping i haven't disappeared all together and floated into outer space. nobody else is awake yet. i'm not making any sense.  i want to talk about this cancerthing still. i walk into my parent's house yesterday and my stepdad is pale. and skinny. this thing has taken him over. and he doesn't do anything. he's totally fucking depressed. maybe he's just really sick. sometimes i stare at him because i'm wondering what he's thinking. i've never in my life seen him like this. this man to me represents the pillar of strength that i have inside of me. the reason i can be one tough motherfucker is this man. this is what i learned. i learned respect for myself. i learned respect for others. i learned the strength of family (however you find your family). i learned how to defend my loved ones and myself. damnit. everything yer sposed to learn from your biological father i learned from him. and he gave it for free.  ********starting over at 12.52 am***********  okay so it's late night now. and i guess it's technically the next day. i feel WAY better about this whole thing. i don't want to reminisce i don't want to dig up memories all these things are for remembering the dead. and he's still alive. tomorrow is the oncologist. today was the doctor that fucked his shit up in the first place. i wasn't allowed in, but my moms tells me that he started ripping this chick a new one ("new one" = "asshole"). my mother, of course, being the pillar of love, stopped him.   i am my own calm center of the universe...not really.   wow. there are people in my life i want to thank and send endless amounts of love/postive creative energy to. y'know what? maybe i should just do that to everybody, or maybe even the universe as a whole. yeah, that's a good idea.

      wow, this is really bad. this hurts. i mean yeah, compared to third world countries, even being homeless in america is paradise, so my life is perfect in that regards, but right now life seems overwhelming. i can't help but sneak into a corner to cry like a little babybitch in thirty-second intervals. i can't openly cry because that doesn't help this situation and that would do nothing to help my mother, who's a fucking CHAMP.    my life is playing out as one of those profound "meaning of life" questions you ask yourself:  what would you do if you found out one of the people you love and respect the most was gonna die soon?  wait, let's start over.  i just got into las vegas today. to visit the parents. the stepfather was diagnosed with stage 4 stomach cancer which has spread to his liver and all over town. i get into the house and i see that things look actually worse than i thought.   -------okay, let's start this over for the last time. i started this post at 4pm on the 12th, took a 14 hour nap, and now it's 6 am on the 13th---------------------------------  okay. the past 4 days have been 100 percent beautiful, and 100 percent tragic. modern day math sez that equals 200%, which is dumb, because nothing in a system such as the one i exist in can exceed 100%. but according to a new math that has yet to be revealed, that would just equal 0, or 1, or it would be undefined, so whatever.  yeah so whatever. i feel better now, only because my parents are sleeping and i have the morning to myself.   hey. okay. so jimmy came in the 8th. the first words i pooped out were, "hey i have bad news, i can't go on this bike ride." so that settled the bike ride dilemma. we then proceeded to drink a ridiculous amount of malt liquor and beer to settle our woes. there went my straightedge fest. WHOAZ. we had some brilliant, world-shattering conversation that night, but i can't begin to describe it because: 1) i can't remember much of it, and  2) the rest of the conversation after that was even more brilliant.    we left on the 10th from a rental car. and here i am.   these are the physical aspects of this journey. i'm going back to bed now, i'll just say more later.

      so. yeah. this moral dilemma has gotten out of hand.   phone call from the mother today reveals that my stepdad has stage 4 cancer. what, you say? basically it means the doctor comes in and tells you yer gonna die. no way around it at this point. oops, i mean, the only thing we can do is give you chemo. so not only will you have cancer, but before you die you will puke out all of your internal organs, and you won't have any hair left. looks like you'll be opting for a closed casket funeral.   FUCK. some part of me knew this.   fuck.   so i guess he will not be birthing the first of a new alien species. we were all wrong, it's not a fetus in the form of a tumor latching itself to his innards, it's just cancer. they know it's spread to his liver, but they don't know where else.  the most FUCKED-UP part (really, honestly, it gets more fucked up), is that the hospital doctor says it's been this bad for 3-6 months. yeah. my stepdad went to his regular doctor in NOVEMBER. fucking last YEAR, because he was feeling like supershit. and his doctor kept putting off tests. they gave him a coupla heart tests, but everything else got put on the backburner. there was one time they scheduled him like, 2 months in advance for a test. he gets there, and the chick working the desk sez, "uhh...there's a scheduling conflict so we can't fit you in," or some dumb shit like that. i remember my mother calling in spurts with all sorts of reasons as to why the testing kept getting junked. meanwhile, the troop of midgets that's infested his body has left toxic waste in the form of cancer. did they know? were they keeping this a secret? were they trying to spare telling him he has cancer? were they scared of his reaction? did they want to shirk-off the responsibility to some other doctor that would be better at telling him? that's ludicrous, i know. but the fact that the timing has lead to this, that also feels a bit ludicrous.    i need a chat with the divine.  my mother says she really wants me there. jimmy gets in tonight on a train, and we were sposed to leave on the 10th. we will talk and decide what goes on.   these walls are fucking breathing for me.  am i pissed off and angry?  FUCK YEAH.  which step is that? and which one comes next?  i'm not asking for sympathy or sorry's, i took up this blogthing to record a timeline because memory doesn't serve as well as it thinks it does. and i don't think my body has enough skin to map out the history inside of me in the form of tattoos. paper is a waste, and communicating by voice to other humans runs the risk of what was meant getting lost in translation.

      oh i forgot to say that when i was talking to my stepdad today (last night), we decided that his tumor is in fact, not a tumor (insert: arnold schwarzenegger accent, circa kindergarten cop). this so-called tumor is an alien fetus. he is to birth the first of a whole new species. i'm excited, that's for sure.

      today is the day of the month that is 7. nope, nothing prolific to say. i leave in three days.   a moral dilemma stirs.  they found some crazy-ass jesus-shaped tumor (not really) hanging out next to my stepdad's stomach. no really though, this shit is pretty close to the size of my head. that's why he couldn't hold any food down, and also why he couldn't breathe. it's squishing his esophagus. the only thing they know is that they might have to take out his stomach, and replace it with part of his small intestine.   this moral dilemma is coming from me chosing to stay here and taking the big NY bike ride, rather than catch a plane to Vegas to lend some support. the thing is, i asked both of my parents if i should come out there. my mom just told me to ask my stepdad, and he just told me not to come out until something was drastically going wrong, and it wasn't a problem since i'm coming out in 2 months anyhoo. i dunno though. if they cut him open and accidentally leave a real midget in there, i'm going to Vegas baby. then we can sell tickets to the "midget lodged in man's throat" show. that would be neat.   besides, my brother isn't going. the eldest is the gauge as to what the appropriate action is. so there.

      HA! i woke up to national public radio telling me that John Edwards is running as Vice Prez with John Kerry. i think that's rad, and i think the only reason that happened was so that the press can coin the term "the two johns." fuck the issues, i say, it's all about public relations. sweeeet.

      plans, fo shiz-o. the summertime. okay now listen. i'm only gonna say this once and i hate getting interrupted. these are pretty solid, however everything only gives the illusion of being solid.   10th of july my cohort and i, we will call him jimmy, as this is what his mother calls him, launch into outer space on bicycles and ride to nueva york. who the hell knows how long that's gonna take. if we do it slowstyles, the most it would take is 20 days. so.  no matter what, i'm getting my ass on a train to chicago on august 1st, and then i will arrive there august 2nd.  somewhere around the 4th-5th, two amazing and gorgeous ladeez are arriving at my door to wisk me away to the michigan wom("y" or "a" goes here)n's music fest. on the 10th or so we leave that joint and head to chicago.   somewhere in here, hopefully there is a short adventure with phoebe.  the 25th i get on a train to san francisco. the 27th is when i get there. then i get to hang with the likes of katie o and zachslow.  1st o' sept i join zach and co.'s entourage to burning man. which ends the 5th, 6th, y'know, whatever.  then i'll take a fabulous greyhound from reno to las vegas to visit the parents.   i leave LV on a plane the 15th to get back to chicago.  the 17th of sept, my favorite (and only) brother gets hitched to his lovely lady jean. i think i'm gonna wear a dress for this. does anyone wanna come and be my date? i probly won't make out with you though.   the 23rd of sept, my dad turns something like, 65 years old. i think.  the 25th of sept i hop on another greyhound towards phoenix. hopefully on the way there i get to stop in oklahoma to beat up my friend el saunde. because she deserves it. and it will hurt. and she will love it. she doesn't know i'm thinking of doing this. but if she reads this before she gets the surprise i sent her in the mail, then she will know that i'm thinking of doing this. ooo, i'm scared.  when i get to phoenix. i have to get a job immediately. i'm gonna be so damn poor. i'm already so damn poor. fuck it.  the cool thing about living this whole life thing like i'm doing now, is that whenever i tell an older person i have no definite plans for the future, every single one has told me to do all this when i'm young. they're like "DON'T GET MARRIED DON'T HAVE KIDS ONCE THAT HAPPENS, YER SCREWED." seriously.   but who decides when we get old?

      does anyone in the house have any suggested reading in regards to world economics? i don't even know, but i think the u.s federal budget deficit is getting close to the 400 BILLION dollar mark, if it isn't already  there. that seems like, um, A LOT. this post is everything i know about money. so if i get anything wrong, somebody tell me. i'm pretty sure something will go wrong here.  okay when you're in debt, you owe something. whatever it is. you don't have anything in the solid world to justify the purchase of whatever good and/or service you rendered.  when an individual goes into debt, he/she files for bankruptcy. assets are sold (maybe) to offset the debt, and he/she's credit rating goes poo-poo. when a huge company goes bankrupt, assets are sold, and the stock of that company goes from like, $400 dollars a share, to like, 50 cents a share (i think my stepdad owns a bunch of enron stock now, he bought it when they went bankrupt). if you worked for that company, and you were expecting a large amount of your retirement funds to come from selling the stock of that company, oops, yer screwed.   the worth of a government's economy shows in the value of their monetary unit versus other countries. if your country's money is worth more than another country's, it means you have more solid goods to back it up. when a country goes bankrupt, what happens? from what i know, the value of their monetary unit goes from whatever amount, to basically zero. just like big business. this is because everything just stops. and someone realizes that a country doesn't have shit to show for all the money they borrowed. they don't have any natural resources to trade, or any agricultural worth. the government disbands because who the hell is gonna listen to somebody who just fucked up the country, AND, most of the politicians will end up just as poor as the rest of the population, because paper money means shit at this point. then chaos reigns supreme, people loot shit, and they end up sucking on dirt for nutrients. after that, the country has to start selling it's assets, like, public lands, government offices and supplies, and even manpower. so i think this is when big companies from wealthier countries come in to buy cheap land, and cheaper manpower. for example, i dunno, one of those countries where your shirt was made. that country probably doesn't have a lot of natural resources, therefore a bad economy, a large population with no jobs, and no government to regulate what the big business does to the land or the people.   but who decides when a country's debt is too much?  i'm talking about this because i heard a conspiracy theory where Bush and company were intentionally charging the national credit card until the world realizes we are well beyond the means to back our shit up. if this happens and we go bankrupt, the only people who will be "rich," will be the people with precious metals(gold), shiny rocks(diamonds), and that there texas tea (all them natural resources). maybe even land and weapons. the people with most of these things right now are them there ceos. and them there millionaires, like dubya and most of his cabinet. so if we go bankrupt, bush and company will more than likely be the first ones to get dibs on all the public lands(i'm gonna get me one of them aircraft carriers). that way, the prez can buy the alaskan wildlife and start another oil company that goes completely bust. and if the u.s. goes down, we take the whole world with us, and there goes globalization. then every piece of the earth can be bought and then destroyed, because who's gonna regulate?   what happens to the middle/lower class? oh, a lot of us die. a lot of us end up in sweatshops. it'll be just like feudalism.  and the world bank, what is that? that's a totally imaginary banking institution that has no worth, whatsoever. it's made-up. there's nothing to back that up. that's like me, making up a whole new credit card, telling people it's a credit card, them believing me, and me using it to buy stuff. i think. and if i'm right, that's dumb.  somebody help me.

      i just had a really great one-hour conversation with my stepdad. he is one amazing human being. if you want to listen to some cool stories about growing up in chicago starting during the depression and beyond, i suggest you call him. and he probly wouldn't mind, cuz he's shacked-up in a hospital right now. there are some stories he won't tell you, cuz he's on a public phone, but he'll tell you in person.  so i probly could've gone camping, but i wouldn't have had a good time. tony (the stepdad) is gonna have angioplasty on tuesday and some other shit after that and then some other shit after that and so on and so forth. apparently, there are a family of midgets running amok throughout his intestines and beyond. they came in through the earlobes, nostrils, and mouth during his sleep, set-up a skid row of a settlement around his esophagus, and canoed through the arteries to start a franchise around his liver. before the time of the franchise, the ruling midget had committed genocide and killed a whole class of smaller midgets living peacefully throughout the stomach area. thankfully, a few living members of the smaller midget clan overthrew that kingdom and convinced the next ruling king to exile his people into the liver. anyways, people aren't sposed to have ANY midgets whatsoever living in their bodies, so our modern day medicine is going to commit a justifiable genocide of it's own towards these little bastards. i commend thee, o modern day medicine.

      man, i can't sleep. i can't get tired. i keep thinking of stuff. just. stuff. okay, say this evolution thing. the next thing after homosapiens....homo--illuminous? someone said that to me once. the next evolution of man will be called "homo-illuminous." beings of light. yeah. werd. we are all made of light then, but where's the duality? are there beings of dark?  existence, right now, displays itself as two-halves that make up one. man/woman. light/dark. good/bad. and every atom of almost every element is found as two of itself, i.e., it's rare to find just one atom all by itself. it's usually combined with itself (o2, h2...) or a molecule of something else....is the next step in evolution just the realization that the two is actually one? that there is no difference? between anything? that we are all everything and we are all nothing at the same time? this would seem somewhat religious, this combining into one. this is the kind of thing that people meditate on for years, trying to reach this existence, but what if regular humans were just thrown into it?   if this is true (2 into 1), before this was there an existence of 3? or would it move exponentially, and if so an existence of 4? before that an existence of 8? this would make sense if we were a big bang...okay so we bang (and so does she), and then we fall into these big clumps that eventually fall into each other and then we just turn into one again, just to bang again. that wouldn't work with the theory that we are still expanding. but maybe it would, because there are so many universes out there that might be existing in 4 still, right now. so we would just keep floating on until every universe exists as one in itself, and still until we exist as one in each other. then fuck, we bang. AGAIN.   yay for ricky martin and that hung fellow.  and for every evolution, there are leftovers from the last one. like um, wisdom teeth? so maybe the universe worked in 3 when atoms were born (protons, neutrons, electrons), thus atoms being a leftover of the last evolution of existence as a whole.  this makes sense to me because sometimes it seems like we are just copies of what happens in the universe as a whole. that doesn't make sense until i give examples. okay. so. the smallest particle is an atom (there are smaller, i know, but just listen). in the nucleus of an atom are protons and neutrons combined. then the electrons are in orbit. like the planets around the sun. and humans, for that matter, all orbit around other humans that are most similar to themselves. and think about it, you didn't choose the family you were born with any more than the earth decided which star to fucking float around for billions of years.  and time, shit man, time. fuck time. time is exclusive only to humanity. oy. when i don't worry about time, everything else falls away. really. think about that. first of all, you don't have to worry about getting there on time. then after you stop worrying about that, you stop worrying about other people being on your time. after that the realization grows deeper and deeper. you don't get caught on to other people, all groping for their little bit of time and trying to make you fit into theirs'. so what if i'm now just a lonely floating piece of space dust, hurling into everything and nothing? ashes to ashes, dust to dust, anyway. it's in the bible.   and, if we were to turn into light, that would be pretty fucking cool, cuz then we could fly. if you think about it, it'll be like fish in water. water is more dense than fish, so fish float in water. the entire planet, shit, everything, is just space made of atoms and molecules, and light is less dense than that, so we would just move in it and around it. we would be able to move in between the particles of atoms (wait, no, except for those too dense, think of shadows and the things that cause them).   crazy, even more, is this whole free-will thing. so the rest of the universe lives outside of time, and we live in time. the monkeys in asia don't get to hang out with the monkeys in africa, but we can if we choose. we can even make the monkeys in asia hang out with the monkeys in africa if we wanted. yeah, we don't choose our biological families, but we get to choose a different family of friends if we want. what the fuck is that about?   and why are we fucking shit up? i'm not whining about this, but i'm wondering about this. we are blatantly fucking up the entire planet, we are choosing to destroy our environment, we are making conscious decisions everyday working towards the destruction of the thing that feeds us and keeps us alive. what gives?  oh yeah and don't take any of this as depression, these are just thoughts. i'm not stressed out, and i'm not whining about how i feel like i can't do anything to change the world, because i am. and one person makes a difference. if it comes right down to it, one person can change the world. and i know it.   so fuck off.

      WOW!  i would like to express my gratitude, this first day in july of the gregorian calender, for letting me have the kind of day such as today, the kind that renews my faith in the human race.  thanks.  i do this thing whenever i go to the movies, where i take the wrong train line, get off on the stop i think is closest to where i need to be, walk in the wrong direction, and then walk in a huge circle for about an hour until i see this huge green wall, then i walk towards the wall until i find the movie theater. i've done this at LEAST 3 times. i never learn. ever. i get lost every time going back to the train, too. for some reason the directions won't make an imprint on me brain. er, i should say, the FASTEST directions won't make an imprint.   anyhoo..so i walk into the building where the theater is and check out the showtimes, hmmm....i can wait an hour-anna-half and go see the new michael moore movie, or i can run and catch the next show of "supersize me." then it hits me, WHY don't you go see Supersize Me, and then sneak into Fahrenheit 9/11? i'm a genius, i tell you. cuz the timing works out perfect. AND. they were showing in theaters that were right next door to each other. how can i say that jesus hates me ever again if i've been blessed with such an offering? SHIT. so i see Supersize Me. GREAT F*ING MOVIE. go see it. NOW. DO IT. i think everyone i know, knows the gist, so i'm gonna spare you the plot overview, but i will tell you that it refreshed my faith in the vegetarianism/veganism, anti-corporate politics, and non-gmo/organic food lifestyle. i don't say "renewed" my faith in these things, because i never dropped out of all of those things completely. but it makes my drive towards these goals much stronger.   then, as i'm scoping out the scene to dodge into Fahrenheit 9/11, i see the girl who took my ticket to get into Supersize Me...ACK! and when she took my ticket it was the kind of thing where you both notice each other, cuz we're both some funky chicks. so this is what happened:  she: "hey, what was the movie you just saw?" me: "Supersize Me" she: "cool, whaddya think?" me: "i thought it was fucking awesome" she: "have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11" me: "no, actually, i was just sitting here about to sneak into it." she: "uhh...it's pretty crowded in there..." me: "i'm by myself so...is it cool if i go in?" she: "sure, i won't tell anyone...yer lucky i'm in a good mood" me: "SWEEET...THANKS."  DAMNIT! that's AWESOME. when you just let shit flow, it goes. that's really all the sense i can make of it. life is grand.   and on the way out, there are people with clipboards, signing-up people to vote. now THAT, is a REALLLY good idea. dubya needs to go buh-bye.  then, on the train home, i'm sitting there, evading the glances of strangers, cuz that seemed to be the thing that everyone else was training for, and this big black dude sitting behind me grabs my wrist and sez, "what's this on yer hand?" now, i don't immediately freak out when people grab me, unless they are trying to tickle me, trying to hurt me, or a police officer. so i didn't freak out when he grabbed me, i just said, "oh, those are notes." (and they were notes, i wrote down some things i wanted to remember from the movies i had just seen.) so he puts down my wrist and sez, "i used to think that people who had hair like you were crazy." to which i replied, "what made you change yer mind?" he said, "when i saw you." then i thought, wow, that's cool....this dude is drunk. and that's weird, cuz immediately after i have this thought, he sez, "oh-and don't think i said that cuz i'm drunk. but i am drunk." wow. neat. then we had a conversation about the gay bar he was going to, and how to pull the ladies and the boyz, and then he asks me to go to the club with him. uhhh...well, i was thinking about it, and then i thought harder about how sober i've been the last few months, and i think i really wanted to go but my mouth just blurted out a "no." which was another really good thing, because while he's walking out of the train with his open container of beer, he walks right into a pair of police officers. and this dude was only 18.   did i mention, ladies and gentleman, that the saudis have us by the balls?
