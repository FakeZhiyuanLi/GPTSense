      Started working out again today. Heres the plan. Quit smoking, lift weights, walk/jog, and start eating healthier.Its hard to do I know, heck, I'm smoking a cig right now. But I only had fruit for breakfast, I'm drinking water. Did chest presses and crunches today, and some back exercises. Not to mention walked and jogged a lil ways. Little steps will help me reach my goal. I'm going to get back into shape. I may never have the perfect body but I will not tolerate being obese anymore. I have several reasons for doing this.  1, To be healthier. My dad died from massive heart failure and the doc told him and me chances are it would happen to me too. 2, How many women could love someone that is a fat slob. I need to feel better about myself to attract someone I guess. If I'm more confidant, it will show.  3, I'm just tired of being fat. Tired of looking soft. I have a good base from when I lifted before. I'm broad with decent shoulders and chest and arms, just need to lose the middle.  I'm sure I could think of other reasons, but thats enough. I've talked with God about it. Asked for his help. I need self control. God is helping me with that.

      This is just one of my most recent writings. Don't know whether to call it poetry, pitifulness, or what.      Tonight Tonight I think of you. I wonder where you are, what you are feeling. Have we met? Have we passed each other on the street? Do I know your name? Do you know mine? I think of these things tonight, as with every night. I sit here waiting, hoping, dreaming of you. There are times when I wonder if you exist. Times when I think you're an illusion. A shimmering glimpse of what life should be like. A happy life with you at my side. To share the ups and downs. To rely on you as much as you rely on me. Thats tonight.  Tomorrow Tomorrow I will cry. Because I will wake up and you're not here. There'll be no scent of you on my pillow. Noone to give a morning kiss. I'll go through my day wondering why tomorrow has to come, why couldn't the night last forever. Even if I were dreaming at night it would be of you, and we would be together. But tomorrow brings new pain. New realizations. Am I waiting in vain? Do dreams really come true?   Tonight Please don't end. Tonight I have you. We are together. Even if I dream, don't let me wake.  Tomorrow I woke. My dream ended. I'll live. I always do. Nothing can stop me. As long as I have tonight

      OK. This has not gone well at all. Not only did I not give up smoking(yet). As far as eating better?  Yeah right, I'm developed a personal relationship with Wendy's it seems. But I have not given up completely, All I have to do is maintain a diet and routine for 12 days and it becomes habit after that. So the experts say. I really do need to do this. Heck, I get winded getting up in the middle of the night to take a dump. LoL Anyway, I'll update with my success or defeat at a later time.
