       Okay, fucking honestly. I went to drawing class today, and I was angry at first because he was making me feel bad because my drawings looked a lot more like the things we had to draw than almost everyone else's. And because I had to keep staring at a mirror I was holding ridiculously close to my face. He had us draw enlarged sections of our face (the eyes, a nose, a mouth, and anything else) all on separate sheets of paper. Towards the end of class he had us take all those drawings and glue them together in order to make a giant face. My face looks really angry. I swear, I wasn't drawing any of the sections angry, and by themselves they looked nice, but now with it all together, both eyebrows are in a sort of glare and it looks like he's baring his teeth. Like he's snarling or something. Some of the faces people put together ended up being taller than the person that drew it. He said I did great today, and I liked my final product, so I wasn't angry when I left.  &nbsp;  I'm going to have to miss a class. The one on the 31st, because of stupid family reunion campout week.  &nbsp;  Susie and Kit drove me to and from class, which was very nice of them. It seems like every time I'm in the van with Susie driving she invites me to go somewhere with their family. This time she said how I should go down to California with them some time.  &nbsp;  I went over to Talbert with Jenny after I got home. She was right when she said there wasn't much to do. We hiked around a little bit, and it was pretty out there, but just to hot and humid for hiking.  &nbsp;  I got home about 1:00pm and started cleaning. Okay, I cleaned my room, I vacuumed the entire house - even my parent's bedroom, which they never require me to do, I did all the dishes in the sink, I cleaned the upstairs bathroom, I tidied up the kitchen counter, I cleaned my brother's messes in the family room and in the living room, I washed all the towels and everything else in the laundry room and proceeded to fold and put them all away, and I watered all of my parent's plants. I was satisfied from a job well done, so at about 4:00pm, I ventured over to my bed and took a nap.  &nbsp;  I wake up, and it was 6:00pm. I hear the television on downstairs. Apparently, my brother never went to the beach. And now he and Sarah were home. And it was obvious that they were. They had dishes all over the kitchen and messes and messy and fuck fuck fuck.  &nbsp;  So by the time parents get home, the house is going to be how it was when they left. This just fucking sucks. I mean, I still know that I cleaned and it gave me something productive to do, but now it just seems like it was for nothing.  &nbsp;  God, I can't wait until I get my own place of residence.  &nbsp;  Those Coppertone Sunscreen commercials make me mad. You know those two commercials that talk about how people get skin cancer? It seems like they're using scare tactics to get you to buy sunscreen. But me? I still look to Lewis Black's  The White Album  for my advice on sunscreen.  &nbsp;  Mmmm. Lewis Black. I love you, you angry, angry Jew.  &nbsp;  I got  Transformer  by Lou Reed and  It's Not Funny  by David Cross.   Dude... dude. That 1993 "I Love the 90's." They're talking about "Quantum Leap." A couple people talk about whose body they would jump into if they could. Scott Stapp comes on and says, "I wouldn't jump into anybody. I'm happy with who I am." Okay, even if you look past the fact that what he said is insanely self-centered and egotistical, at least he could make something up. You know, the reason they interview people is so they can show funny clips and entertain people. Scott, just go die.

       Mmmm. Parents are going camping with their friends in a couple minutes, and John already left to go to the beach with his friends. Thus I have the house to myself for two days. A pleasant reward for doing well in class methinks.  &nbsp;  Dude, for once, Netflix has let me down. And they let me down  hard . I mentioned how I received  Pee Wee's Big Adventure  in yesterday's post, did I not? Well, I went to take it out of the patented Netflix sleeve to watch it when I got home from class and, Oup! It was cracked. The DVD. There is a big crack going halfway across the DVD. I guess it was bound to happen eventually, that an ordered specimen would be smashed by the mail-people, but did it have to happen to Pee Wee? God, I mean... he was so young.  &nbsp;  It's so hot... So hot... And Amy got air conditioning... She's so lucky... So lucky.  &nbsp;  School is out for me now! Today was really easy. Mr. Gilford brought us donuts and orange juice to drink when we arrived. We cleaned up the room all nice and pretty and organized our notebooks that were to be turned in after the final. For the final we went out to a park on Eagle Creek, because some of the questions required us to be outside around trees and a stream. We all scattered around this play structure area -some were on swings, some were on slides, some were on monkey bars- and worked on the really simple final test. Not that we really needed to, but Gilford let us use our notebooks and all the handouts we received to look up information on the final. Seriously, I wish I had him for a teacher longer.  &nbsp;  Jenny freaked me out for a little bit. She was having a stomach ache and it looked like it was really hurting her. But you know what? That didn't stop her from saving some kid's life. Okay, maybe he wasn't going to die, but she saved him from getting scratched up. There was this kid -five years old, as he would later tell us- jumping up and down on the really thin branches of this tree a ways away from where our class was. He was yelling, too. Not urgent "Help me!" yelling, just sort of "Hey, look, I'm in a tree! I want attention for my god-like feat!" yelling. After a couple minutes of that, Stephanie and Kristin walked over to see if he needed help getting down. After about ten seconds of them talking to him, Jenny stood up (we were sitting in the shade over by the playground) and started running over to the kid, and seriously, right when she stood up, the kid fell about three feet on to some lower branches.  &nbsp;  Like a superhero, she jumped through the branches over to the trunk of the tree and helped the little guy down on to safe ground. Turns out his parents owned the campground, or something, so I'm sure he was used to being up in trees.  &nbsp;  It was cool.  &nbsp;  After we finished up the final we headed back to the school. Gilford told us that if we wanted to, we could go to the computer lab and have everyone enter a CRLE for the course. It means Career Related Learning Experience, and our school district requires two of them before a student can graduate. So, dude, I only have to do one more CRLE. Awe-some.  &nbsp;  Then my dad drove Jenny home. Then we went home. Then I napped. Then I stabbed my neighbor. Now I'm typing.  &nbsp;  My parents just left and my mom told me not to have any parties or do any happy dancing while they're gone. No really, she actually said that. "No happy dances." Sorry guys, I know you were looking forward to that.

       Whoa! Cool! Blogger changed! Now when I type my entries I don't have to do html! Now I just have to select the text and press a button. Blogger is now completely better than Xanga. That's right, I said it. And I believe it.  &nbsp;  Perhaps I spoke too soon about Netflix. Today, waiting for me in the mailbox was  Pee Wee's Big Adventure ,  Dummy , and  Le DÃ®ner de cons  ( The Dinner Game )! Three of my movie picks! Hurrah! I want to have people over this weekend to watch movies.&nbsp; Anyone want to?  &nbsp;  Also, we're all seeing  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . I'm in deep need for a Kaufman/Gondry fix.  &nbsp;  And I'm finally going to go to Talbert with Jenny, after three weeks of delaying it and delaying it and delaying it.  &nbsp;  Man, I'm crazy nervous. Our presentation is tonight. The fourteen people in our class spent the last two days collaborating on a PowerPoint Presentation. Each of us has a small section that we have to talk about. I have to give an overview of what we studied these past three weeks. Something like six slides. Only about threeish minutes of talking. And I made four of the five GIS maps, which are all very professional looking.  &nbsp;  I need to go practice. Wish me luck?

       I know that Ben was on an episode of "Freaks and Geeks." He played the secret service agent that hated his job. I would quote him, but I haven't seen it in so long. Doesn't he talk about how sometimes you just have to stare at a wall and things move? Something like that. And so Rosso gave him the career survey to see what he would be good at. But just because he had a guest spot on "Freaks and Geeks" doesn't make him a cast member of the show.  Goddamn, I miss that show. I know it's on dvd. I should Netflix them all. Although that would take forever. My family puts movies on our queue, and then when they get here (which only takes two days), they never watch what they order and they just sit on the kitchen counter for weeks. It's irritating. I've had  Manic  and  Dummy  and  Liberty Heights  and  Pee Wee's Big Adventure  and  Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns  on there for over two months.  Yesterday was better than Monday. For me, at least. I think my class experienced the low point of our three weeks. The day started out with us discovering that someone had broken the front driver's side window and mirrors of the short bus we use to get around. Just fucking shattered them. Yet, the front door of the bus was still unlocked and everything we left inside remained. Cowards. At least take something as proof that you did it. There was glass all over the driver's seat and the floor and the pavement around. We had to spend a good thirty minutes cleaning everything out. While we were doing that, this lady that needed the bus next to ours revealed that someone had broken into her bus too. Nothing was broken and nothing was taken, but there were cigarette butts all over and what looked like urine sprayed all over the seats, floor, ceiling and windows. It was so icky.  But luckily our bus was urine and cigarette free. It was also lucky that it was so damn hot outside and Mr. Gilford would have rolled his window down anyway, had it remained intact over the night.  We spent our time in more shady areas so I didn't get as hot as I did on Monday.  Oh, bees. At the second site we went to, on the path about three feet from the stream, there was this giant log that had a bees nest inside it. So after about half the class stepped on the log to get across it and down to the stream bank, the bees started getting pissed off and attacking. This one kid, Bobby, had two or three stings on his hand and on his back, Andy had a couple on his legs, and Mr. Gilford had at least four or five stings on his legs. It was weird when they first started their strike, nobody really knew that there were bees around until Gilford started hopping around slapping his legs. It was fairly humorous until I realized that insects were boring their sharp-as-nails stingers into the skin on his legs.  But I got away bee-sting-free! Although a couple huge-ass mosquitos bit me on my hand and arm. Now I have these huge, itchy, red swells on my hands.  The rest of the week is just inside work, which is great. We've spent today in the computer lab and will continue to after this lunch break is over. Dude, today, Gilford said we can break for lunch from 11:30 to 12:30. He's like meg awesome.  Nah,  Feed  slang doesn't work for me. Null.  Jenny walked over to Safeway to grab some lunch. I should've gone with her. But nope, I'm lazy and tired of walking in the hot hot sunshine, and I needed to type this out, because I'm a slave to my blog. My sexy, sexy blog. So now I'm sitting here typing, drinking my Code Red and listening to BK's great, great, great cover of "My Drug Buddy." It's nice.  I had good talks with Amy last night. I realized some things that I need to try and take care of. It's gonna be hard, but I don't think I can be happy until unless I at least try. And I still think Amy should take my advice, because it's not good to let things fester inside you.

       I felt kind of like Robert Smith today. I don't know, my new hair situation makes me think of Robert Smith. I feel cool and people have been complimenting me. I like it.   .   Today was so icky. It got up to 90 degrees while we were out at this little shit-hole called Richardson Creek. The water wasn't moving at all so nothing was getting cleaned and all the sediment and icky stuff just sat in there, making it smell bad. And the research group that I've been assigned to for the presentation on Thursday is the longest and wettest and most complicated one. I'm with Jenny, which is neat and all, but we have to identify all the plant life around the stream and measure the volume of the water going through the stream. Today we only went to that one site, and we were outside for something like two hours. But tomorrow we have to do the same thing at two different sites. Wednesday is preparing for the presentation to the Clackamas Watershed Council, and Thursday is the presentation itself. It's gonna be a loooooong week.  But it's the last week, and I'm starting to be glad for that. I'm just so tired. It'll be incredibly nice to just go back to spending my days at home, playing video games, downloading music. I need to burn a bunch of Cds so I have a bunch of new stuff to listen to during the family reunion/camping trip. And I'll be able to spend more time with friends and not have to leave early because it's a school night for me.  Hey, speaking of school, I want to brag for a second. Gilford handed out our first progress reports, and I have a 97%. So far we've done a lot of work but we haven't turned in the majority of it. Of the stuff we've turned in, I've only missed two points. Two! On my CIM essay that I wrote last weekend, I got all fours and 20 out of 20 points. I was the only one in the class to pass CIM with that assignment. And Gilford wrote a long note on the back commending me of a job well done.  I so kick Robin's ass at arm wrestling.  I'm starting to miss Cody. Mostly because of  Anchorman . I know that if  Anchorman  came out while school was in session, him and I would have a field day quoting that masterpiece. It's too bad that I never keep in touch with my guy friends during the summer. Haven't seen Ian, haven't seen James, haven't seen... okay, that's about it. It seemed like the list would be longer when I was brainstorming about what to write.  Okay, I only have a few finishing touches to add to my CIM science inquiry, and then I can sleep. It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  My parents are making me drink a milkshake with this protein powder in it every night as a part of their plan to fatten me up. The protein stuff tastes really bad. Probably because my brother bought it and it's made from soy. Stupid vegan influences.

       I saw  Anchorman  again, this time with the parents. I still found it hilarious, as did mum and dad. Well, they didn't 'still' find it hilarious, because it was only their first time seeing it, but they thought it was damn funny.   I fixed my hair situation. My hair situation didn't really last long and it wasn't that big of a deal, but now it is over. I was just getting really tired of doing the same thing every day; with the thing up in the front. I thought it was cool and that it looked okay on me, but the repetition was just making me a bit annoyed. So I just put it up differently, and I think it looks as okay as the old style. It's more spiky. John still has the camera, so no pictures are available at this time.   I need to get started on my homework. A CIM science inquiry is due on Tuesday for ecology. I know that sounds bad, but it really isn't. Gilford gave the class all the data we need, so all I need to do is write it up. Plus, this stuff is easy.   Bad news friends, I'm afraid that the Weird Al concert is not possible for me to attend. My family will be spending our week-long, family reunion/camping trip up at Baker Lake in Washington. I'm going to have to miss one of my drawing classes too. The one on the 31st. Complete bullshit. And  Garden State  comes out on July 31st. Damn, damn, damn. I  have to  see that movie. I've viewed the preview many, many times and it still gives me chills.   I like how comments are open to anyone, instead of Xanga's Nazi-like commenting regime. And now I can get comments from anonymous people. So now if anyone wants to threaten or make fun of me, you're welcome to go right ahead, because I won't be able to figure out who you are.   I wear a watch now. Times change, get used to it.   "Six Feet Under," is on now. Bye now.

       I'm trying something new out. Blogger seems a lot more free and unrestricted than Xanga does. And I get to customize a lot more without having to pay money.  I was in John's room trying to fix the internet, and as usual, his radio was tuned to NPR. But they had something cool! They were telling a story about Demetri Martin. They said how he was (is?) a writer for Conan in addition to his stand up and that he dropped out of law school so he could tell jokes for a living. They played a couple of his bits, and they were really, really Mitch Hedburg-esque. His voice sounds like Mitch's; laid back, nonchalant. How they both laugh along with the audience after each joke, but not in an annoying self-centered way that a lot of comedians have. In the bits they played, he had soothing guitar music in the background, which reminded me of the jazzy bass in the background of  Strategic Grill Locations . I want to see his Comedy Central Presents now.  Patton was totally on "Reno 911." Patton totally rocks. I totally need to hear his new Cd. I totally need to stop with this 'totally' crap. If I keep going on with this 'totally' thing then I guess that makes me 'totally' lame.  Last night while I was talking about Ray Bradbury's satirical sci-fi books and short stories, I told her about the idea for a story I had. After I saw  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  I really had the urge to try to write something really creative like that. So I came up with a premise.  Just that it would be based around a machine. A machine that can go into your brain and delete memories and feelings of your choice, whenever you want to. So every time you read a book or saw a movie that had an unexpected twist ending, it would be the first time you saw it. And it would be like that for everything. If a great food starts to lose its flavor, you can start over and experience the taste for the first time. If your sex life gets boring and monotonous, then you can start over and it will be like the first time, when there was passion involved.  But that's all I have, and due to my laziness and lack of creative writing ability, I've so far only written less than a page, and have no ideas on how to continue. I'd accept help, if one were to offer it.  Kind of short for my first non-Xanga post.  (The title is a palindrome. Demetri is the King of Palindrome Island.)

       Drawing class in a few hours! Huzzah! The guy said that the first day is all charcoal drawings. This should rock.  Hey Natalie, I think you left your phone at Robin's last night, but I have it now and I'll bring it with me to class. If it isn't hers, then I'm selling it. Hey, don't you judge me. Sometimes a man just needs his crack but doesn't have the money to get it.  Oh man, my mom told me the greatest thing yesterday. I no longer look upon my childhood as being boring and stupid. When I was first learning to talk, my Aunt Nancy would spend her time whenever she was around teaching me songs. So you want to know what the first songs I ever learned to sing were? "Lola" by the Kinks and "Take a Walk on the Wild Side" by Lou Fucking Reed.  One of the first songs I learned was written and performed by a former Velvet Underground member. That means some of the first words out of my mouth were âBut she never lost her head/Even when she was giving head.â That is so fucking awesome! I love my Aunt Nancy even more now. I always wondered what it would have been like if I was born to her instead of my mom, and now I know. It would have fucking rocked.  You know what happened last night? I organized something. I organized a meeting of our friends at a movie theater to see  Anchorman . Okay, that's an accomplishment. Normally when I try to plan things, they don't work out. But last night, Amy, Kit, Robin, Elise, Devin, Natalie and I were all there laughing our asses off at pretty much the funniest movie ever. I'm sorry, but  Wet Hot American Summer  had a good run. I'll always love you even though you are only in second place.  But  Anchorman  had everything and everyone I love. I was squealing at each of the fantastic cameos. Paul, Jay, Jerry, Jack, Fred, Vince, Seth, I loved them all. The only cameo I didn't like was Ben Stiller. Wow, maybe I do just... really not like him. But in our theater, there was a smattering of applause when Ben showed up on screen, which made me want to vomit. He doesn't deserve clapping. The "Mr. Show," and "Saturday Night Live," and "Freaks and Geeks," alumni that had cameos in the movie deserved applause more than Ben did.  Will Ferrell is seriously a god. Everything that is funny seeps from him like jam from a half-eaten donut. One of the jam-filled donuts. You know... with jam inside...  I hope this launches Steve Carell's movie career so he doesn't have to keep doing movies like Sleepover and Bruce Almighty (although he was effing hee-larious in that).   I donât get why nobody laughed at Fred Willard's conversations with his son. I thought those were pretty funny.  We listened to a little bit of Hedwig in the car on the way to the movie (my mom drove Amy, Robin, Elise, and I) and they really liked it. So after the movie we dropped by my house, grabbed Hedwig and watched it at Robin's. It was another fun night in Robin's basement.  Okay, well, enough for now, I gots to go get ready.  EDIT:  Drawing class, rocked. I seriously loved it. The teacher guy puts no pressure on anybody to do good, just to do. Just to get something on the paper to vent and express yourself and not care what other people think of it, to just make it because it means something to you.  I know I'm gonna love the rest of the classes. I feel so much better just from all the venting I did in that two-hour time period. Just pressing as hard as I could on the paper, getting my hands completely filthy with graphite but not caring. My fingers were sore, but I felt so great.  Okay, in the last three days, there have been some things said to me that I will remember forever and ever and ever. Here they are:  1. On Friday for Ecology class, we spent all day walking around this restoration site at Johnson Creek with a guy from OSU. At lunch time, Jenny and I were sitting on a play structure eating our lunches and playing that game where you have a bunch of dots and you have to make squares by taking turns making single lines. I forget what it's called. So the guy, Sam Chen, comes up the play structure to talk to us. He said that we were both incredibly knowlegable about the field for kids our age and could easily have successful futures in the field or a related one.   2. Thursday night after a few hours at Amy's, I hitched a ride to my house in the Shields van. Susie asked me about my situation with driving and I told her that I've had my permit for a year, but have only actually driven three times. I told her about my driving at our family property last weekend, and she said something along the lines of "I don't know why, but I would trust you to drive my car right now."  3. When I was heading into the back room to wash my completely black hands off from the graphite pencil and the teacher stopped me to chat. He asked how old I was and if I had any past art experience. I told him I was going into my Junior year and that I've only taken basic art classes my Freshman year and in middle school. He told me that I did a great job for the first class.  "At least she died doing what she loved most. Comitting suicide."

       In recent talks with Amy, it has been decided that Anchorman should be seen tomorrow at either 5:45 or 7:45 at Division, since Century isn't showing it (total bullshit, man). However we cannot set an exact time at this moment since neither of our parents will be home, we will both be needing transportation to the event. I really wish that for once I could get my own ride or my parents could drive people, because I hate asking for rides places, but my parents are leaving town, so there we go.  Capturing the Friedmans is on HBO in a few minutes. Sweeeeeet.  Today, our bus ride was about an hour and a half, and we were all tired, and Jenny put her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. It was cute as hell.  We went up really high in the watershed. I think he said it was about 2000 feet up, but I have no concept of measurements over a foot, so I could be wrong with that. We went to this old growth forest, an area that hasn't been cut down for over a hundred years. It was really pretty, even if the little bugs were annoying. I seriously need to get my camera back from Johnny McBrotherton.  Speaking of brother, I lent him Fight Club to read, and you know what I got? Since Middlesex was really starting to bore me (maybe I'm just not in the mood for it right now), John let me borrow Sarah's copy of Invisible Monsters. Sarah's signed copy of Invisible Monsters. His signature is on the front page. I hugged the book because. And since I'm sure Chuck hugs every book before it gets sent out to the store, I... basically hugged Chuck Palahniuk. So fuck you.  Like the new header? That's all me, baby. All from the mind of Mr. Frankenhauser.

       Kind of an embarassing thing happened in drawing class today. We were supposed to draw just an unrealistic face and then embellish it over and over and make things darker and lighter and so on and so on. I got a little carried away and ended up changing the nose on my face into an elephant's trunk and drawing the ear that was visible into a large elephant ear. Then we had to post what we had so far up on the walls, and everybody else's looked realistic, and there was mine with cartoony eyes and an elephant's trunk. It was pretty awkward. So I dropped my pants and started dancing on a table while singing "The Lady is a Tramp." That took away the attention from my drawing. And it showed them all my exquisite singing skills.   But we got to look at other charcoal drawings and go back and edit our own to make it look more realistic. I think I did okay. It looked human, at least. I was really proud of the nose, but I spent way too much time on it. Natalie's drawing was so crazy good and dark and amazing. She's gonna do good if she sticks with art in her future.   Oh, but on the last day of Ecology class in a conversation with Mr. Gilford, I told him about how I was taking the drawing class in a studio on Division, and he told me that he knows of the place because he lives in the area. So who did I run into after I walked out the door today? Mr. Andrew Gilford. It was neat neat neat.   That Six Flags commercial with the dancing old guy creeps the hell out of me. If you saw a guy like that dancing in front of a bus and beckoning you to hop on, why the hell would you? You're just asking to be raped, my friend. Raped with a fist. An old, wrinkly fist.   Ciao.

       I love my friends.  I just got back from Robin's house. That was probably the best stay at Robin's I've ever had. It was just me, her, and Amy and we didn't do anything spectacularly interesting, just lazed around and played with sock monkeys and watched the Clerks Cartoons. But something seemed different and it was crazy fun. It sucks that I always have to leave. I never ever want to leave Robin's house. But since I have a penis, I can never spend the night. Damn you, penis. Ruining everything.  But mum said I had to be home around midnight. I decided to walk home since it was nice out and I don't live very far away from Robin's house. One of my favorite things has to be walking around at night. I hate walking around during the day, because there's so many cars around and there's so many other people outside and I feel uncomfortable. I feel like everybody is looking at me and judging me. But at night, there's really nobody around. Everything is closed and dark and it seems a lot more private. I can walk around with my headphones on and feel like the world was put here just for me. I get to feel egotistical and not feel bad about it.  I'm starting to look forward to the camping trip. The lake right next to the campsite is just heavenly. The snow and ice and glaciers from Mt. Baker melt and run right down into Baker Lake, so it's always really cold, which will kick the 90 degree weather's tight little ass.

       That title is the tagline for the movie  The Story of the Weeping Camel . I saw a poster for it when we went to see  Eternal Sunshine  at Cinemagic, and Robin and I laughed at it over, and over, and over.   I went outside! Huzzah! Robin's daddy took Robin, Elise, Devin and I to.. Feyrer Park?&nbsp;Feryer Park? Something like that. It was the place that Gilford took us for the Ecology final. The place where that kid fell down the tree, only to be saved by Super Jenny. Yeah, that place. We swam in the river and drank Coke and played on the playset and had a jolly good tyme. We had sunscreen that smelled like bubble gum. It took all my willpower&nbsp;not to try to taste the stuff, or to rip a chunk out of my sunscreened body with my teeth.   The presence of large Mehican (I spelled it like that purposefully. If they're going to pronounce it like that, then I'm going to spell it like that.) families was astounding. Each picnic table along the river had about ten people of hispanic origin occupying the seats.   Dude, okay, am I the only one that thinks changing a baby's diaper in public, unsheilded from all the people around is completely disgusting? Seriously, dude. There was a bathroom not ten feet away, yet there was some lady changing her baby right on the fucking top of one of the picinic tabes. Besides the fact that there were about fifty people in the area, and all were exposed to a smelly nude baby, people eat off of those tables. That's just fucking gross. Somebody needs to invent a&nbsp;little fold out personal tent to hide things like that.   Haha, you know those boxes with the built in gloves that scientists use to handle nuclear or poisonous materials? It should be like that.   Whatever.   I've seen two displays of horrible, horrible parenting over the last week. The first one was at Blockbuster on Monday. While my father and I were waiting in line to check out our items, and there was a mother with her two kids in front of us. This little boy, probably 8 or 9 years old, had a rattail growing down to the bottom of his shoulder blades. Today at the park, I was done swimming so I grabbed Mr. E's  Beautiful Freak  and sat down at our table for a while. And there was this kid, couldn't have been more than two years old. He was wearing nothing but a diaper and sucking on a bottle. When I saw the back of his head, he had the beginnings of a rattail, only about one inch long, while the rest of his head was shaved down to stubble.   God, that just makes me sick. Who the hell thinks that is a stylish and cool looking haircut? Who?!? It's gross. Why would you want to punish your kids like that? Everybody already hates little kids that don't belong to them, so why give them another reason to be hated? Ugh. I swear to God, someday,  someday , I'm going to drive around the country with a pair of scissors in each hand, and lop off every rattail in sight. I will. I will. I fucking will.   eMule is my savior. It's a p2p file sharing program that just kicks so much ass so far. I leave for weeklong family reunion camping trip on Sunday, and I've been downloading all the cds I possibly can so I'll have a bunch of new stuff to listen to on the drive and while I'm there. That's where eMule comes into my life. On Kazaa, whenever I'm trying to get all the mp3s from a certain Cd, there is always one or two songs that nobody has or that take months to download. But with eMule I've been downloading zip files of whole cd's. After two days I've managed to gain  Beautiful Freak  by Eels,  On Avery Island  by Neutral Milk Hotel,  Tyrannosaurus Hives  by The Hives,  Yours, Mine & Ours  by The Pernice Brothers,  Franz Ferdinand  by Franz Ferdinand,  Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid &nbsp;by Elefant, and all three volumes of  69 Love Songs  by The Magnetic Fields. Dude, it's not like that. It's called  69 Love Songs  because it's three Cds, each with 23 songs. 23 x 3 = 69. Most of it is serious and pretty music, but some of them are just weird.   Dammit. July 28th only marks the opening of  Garden State  in New York and L.A. We have to wait until August 6th for it to open in other states. Bastages.   I want to get everyone together and go see  The Village  when I get back from camping. I want, want, want that movie so badly. I want to jump and scream and sweat and be amazed like I have at all M. Night's past movies. I love it.   Guys, I'm sorry, I like using Blogger more than Xanga. Things change. I love Xanga, and we got along fine, but I just need to move on. I'll leave my entries up forever, but this is where I'll be from now on, and this is where I'm staying.   Done, and, done.

       Oooh! Looky what I made!  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Oh yeah. He's a scary one. And here's another!  &nbsp;     Look at those pants! Hawt. And here's my face from drawing class  &nbsp;      See? It's too angry. I need to try to create nicer things.  &nbsp;  Hmmm. What to say, what to say.  &nbsp;  My brother went in for a job interview. He finally decided to get off his lazy graduated ass and join the working force. You know where he applied? That car wash over in Mt. Scott. A car wash. What? Yes. Oh well, at least he's doing something.  &nbsp;  I want to work at a book store. Or a library. That would be complete bliss for me. So, my first job is going to be at either Waldenbooks or Barnes and Noble. I never want to work at a fast food restaurant like so many kids our age. Whenever I recognize a kid behind the counter at McDonalds, it makes me so sad. Actually, I never really want to work at any restaurant. Even a big, nice, fancy one. Two reasons for that: 1. I would suck as a waiter because I know I would drop everything. My balance is horrid as it is, and putting five plates in my hands won't help that along. 2. I don't want to know what goes on in the kitchens. I know, okay, I know that gross stuff goes into food. I read  Fight Club.  I know that in restaurants all over the world, the employees spit, sneeze, piss, and do many other icky things to food but I never want to see or know about any specifics.  &nbsp;  So I'm going to move into a big city after schools out, either for college or to start a career, and I'll also get a job at a library where I'll meet a cute bookish lady and we'll start a family. Yep, that's how it'll happen. Exactly.  &nbsp;  I still don't know what I'm going to do for a career. Not that that's a bad thing,&nbsp; because I'm only sixteen and I won't have to deal with that for a while. But I have possibilities from here to forever. I could go into a scientific field, like something in virology or ecology. I could do something art-related, like painting or directing. I'm signed up for Media Communications next year, so if I like it, I could work on television or radio shows. Psychology is still an open field. My counselor lady today asked me what my stong characteristics were, and when we completed the list, she said I had all the qualities a psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor needs.  &nbsp;  I bought the Season 3 of South Park today. And my parents bought me a scale so I can see how fat I'm getting.  &nbsp;  Party at Amy's tomorrow! Friends! Movies! But most importantly, AIR CONDITIONING! MUAHAHAHAAHHAHA!

        Amy : how many horses do you have in your house?   Me : 13   Me : well, 7, if you don't count the dead ones  &nbsp;  See? I can be funny. Sadistic, yes, but funny.  &nbsp;  Dude, The Shins have broken through. That opening "Woo!" on "Kissing the Lipless," was played on the Johnny Depp "A2Z." Obviously, I know that everyone who viewed that program immediately rushed over to the internet to find out who screamed that godly "Woo!" You know it.  &nbsp;  Did anyone else crack up when that black guy on '99 said it took him four or five times to understand  The Sixth Sense ? Mmmm. I could live forever off of that stuff.  &nbsp;  I watched  The Big Lebowski  today. For the first time. I know, I know, it's horrible. Not the movie, the fact that it was released in 1998 and right now it is 2004. Goddamn, that is my kind of movie. Just a long, nonsensical, and lazy&nbsp;yet complex&nbsp;plot and John Goodman rambling about his experiences in 'Nam. So so funny and unique. And I almost cried. Seriously, after they dumped out the ashes and Dude yells at Walter for all the 'Nam references and Walter just hugs him... damn. I want to make a movie like that. I just want to make movies.  &nbsp;  What happened to that dream? My dream of being like Brendon Small and making a bunch of movies? I'll tell you what, it died, because I lost interest. I mean, I still really want to do it, I'm just not creative enough right now to write anything. I had that one script, and I think it was funny, but I lost interest and didn't find it funny after playing around with it so much. For the longest time, I've just wanted to direct a movie to see what it feels like. I think I could do a good job at it. Hmm.  &nbsp;  But like I said in a conversation with Kit, "I don't have the persistance to make anything bigger than a sandwich."  &nbsp;  Oh shit! Speaking of "Home Movies," Soup2Nuts is releasing a three disc DVD set of "Home Movies" on November 13th. This is very, very good news.  &nbsp;  What the hell? They played part of the chorus of Denis Leary's "Asshole," song during '99, except they bleeped out the word Asshole. So all you hear is  BLEEP oo-ee-ooo-ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oole! So stupid. Why put it in there if they're just going to bleep it? VH1 needs to lower their bleep usage. Like during the South Park part, when Chef said " BLEEP  on my Chocolate Salty Balls. Put 'em in your mouth and  BLEEP  'em." You guys, God, the song is about a tasty salty chocolate snack. He is talking about eating his wonderous product that he slaved over in order to make some money. It is not some lude reference to oral sex. Christ. Get your minds out of the gutters.  &nbsp;  Haha, I said that the black guy  slaved  over his food. Get it? Because we used to whip black people and make them do our chores without pay or food stamps.  &nbsp;  I'm gonna be talking about "I Love the 90's," a lot for the next couple weeks, because it will be all I will be watching. Reruns have never been so tasty good.  &nbsp;  I recieved a junk e-mail from someone that called themselves Shovelful B. Ferreted.  &nbsp;  I found part of my script thingy. Opinions?:   (A man holding an ancient-looking statue runs down a road, being distantly pursued by nine security guards. The guards lose track of the man when they come to a fork in the road, so they stop to figure out which way he went)  Head Guard: Which way did he go?  Guard 1: I think he went that way! (points to left road)  Guard 2: No, no, no, I saw him go that way. (points to right road)  Head Guard: Okay, we'll split up. Half of you go that way (points right) and the rest of you come with me.  Guard 3: Hey, wait a minute!  Head Guard: What?  Guard 3: Well, it's just that.. there's nine of us. We can't exactly split in half.  Guard 4: Yeah! If you divide nine in two parts, you get four and a half! And we don't have a half-person with us!  Guard 5: We could make one. And if we're going to chop somebody in half, I propose that it be Johnson.  (Everybody but Head Guard and Guard 2 nod and mutter in agreement)  Guard 2: Shut it Langston!  Head Guard: Look, we're not cutting anybody in half! You four go that way, and the other four of you come with me! Now let's go! He's getting away!  Guard 4: Wait, that's not fair at all. We can't divide into uneven groups. What if he isn't working alone and we get outnumbered!  (Others mutters in agreement again)  Head Guard: Then what do you suggest we do?  Guard 3: Well, since there's nine of us, why don't we split into three groups of three?  Guard 1: But where would the third group go?  (A couple seconds of silence pass by)  Guard 2: Umm... How about they go back to the house?  Head Guard: Back to the house? But then there wouldn't be enough people out looking for the thief! Come on people! We need everyone out here looking for the statue! Now let's go!  Guard 5: How about I just go back to the house and you guys go look for the statue?  Head Guard: (Hesitates while contemplating the query) ...Alright, you head back to the house. You four! That way! You three! With me!  Guard 1: Why does he get to go back! It's cold out here and I have to go to the bathroom! I should get to go!  (Other guards chime in with their own reasons why they should go back to the house)  Head Guard: Everybody shut up!  (Guards all stop talking, except Johnson, who decides to finish his story when the others are all quiet)  Guard 2: ...and I left my hemorrhoid cream back there.  (Everyone backs away and looks at Johnson with glares of disgust)  Head Guard: Johnson... Christ, that's gross.  Guard 2: (pause) They.. they aren't contagious.  (Long pause)  Head Guard: People! We are getting off topic here! That man stole the statue, and if we don't get it back, Klein is going to fire us! Is that what you want?  Guard 4: You know, he's right. We really should be out looking for that guy.  (Other guards all cough-talk phrases like, "Bullshit" and "Suck up")  Guard 4: No! I'm being serious! How about we just have some kind of tournament to determine who gets to go back to the house?  Guard 1: Yeah! We could all play rock-paper-scissors!  Guard 3: No, we should have a basketball tournament!  Guard 5: You guys are so lame. A Magic tourney is the only sure-fire way to decide.  (Other guards simultaniously make their own suggestions)  Head Guard: You guys, come on!  Guard 1: Yeah, we all have our own ideas, so arguing is pointless. We need to think of a way to determine who's idea for a contest we should use to determine the tournament that will determine who gets to go back to the house.  Head Guard: If we don't leave in the next 30 seconds, you're all going back to the house in body bags.  Guard 3: Bags? Hey! How about we have a potato sack race?!  Guard 1: That's perfect! Jonas, you brought your bags with you, right?  Guard 4: Psh. When don't I? (pulls nine bags out from behind his back)  (Guard 4 walks around and hands out the bags to each guard. They all get in a line and prepare to start the race, except for the Head Guard.)  Head Guard: STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!  (Guards all quiet and stare at Head Guard with confused looks)  (Head Guard pulls out his pistol and shoots Guard 5, killing him; When Guard 5 falls to the ground, Guard 4 goes down by his side)  Guard 4: No! You shot Terry! (starts sobbing) You shot Terry!  Head Guard: (While Guard 4 is still complaining) All right! Now there's only eight of us! Now can we please! Go and get the statue back!  Guard 4: (Looks up at the sky) Don't worry Terry! I'm coming with you!  (Guard 4 pulls out his pistol and shoots himself in the head and slumps over Guard 5's body)  Head Guard: Oh, fuck this.  (Head Guard slumps away in the direction of the house, slowly followed by all the other guards)  Guard 3: (to Guard 1 as they are walking toward the house) I told you they were gay.  (Then star-wipe, and.... cut)  &nbsp;  I know, it's short. But at least I wrote something.  &nbsp;  Kit should really start trying to write her Tech Deck mockumentary. Then we can bring it to life in film.

       Well, so long for a week. Camp camp camp.

          I knew I would miss some things, because a lot happened, so here is part two on my reflection of the last week.       I canât believe I forgot about this. This shows how much of a genius my brother is. He bought a projector with the money he received from family for graduation. When he arrived at  Baker Lake , he ran an extension cord from the power hookup all the way to his tent. Inside his tent, he set up his projector, a Playstation 2, and his stereo. He then proceeded to put a movie in the PS2 and reverse the image on the projector so all of us outside the tent could watch a movie. We watched  Coneheads , which was actually pretty funny,  Finding Nemo , a little bit of  The Fellowship of the Ring ,  Jaws , and Eddie Izzardâs  Full Circle . And it looked really nice. The picture on the tent canvas was just like that of a projection television.       Man, we really rough it when we camp.       Itâs funny though. When we were kids my mom would prohibit us from bringing our cd players and our Gameboys and anything else electronic because camping was the time to play in the trees and be active. And now we do stuff like this.       When I got home on Sunday, I went into the bathroom to take a shower. When I undid my belt and dropped my pants, a moth flew out of them. This means that the whole seven hour drive home, there was a moth in my pants.       I laughed so hard. Itâs like those old cartoons where someone would open an old box or cabinet and moths would fly out. Man, it was funny.       Oh, guess what? No seriously, guess. Iâm not going to tell you until you guess. Fine. I wonât tell you then.       I love my daddy. One of the windows on his   Lincoln   were acting up and his brakes were making a squeaking noise. So he took it into a shop yesterday morning to get it fixed. When he returned home, he was driving a brand new 2004 Ford Explorer. At first I thought he just rented it while they were repairing his car. Nope. He bought it. The guys at the car repair place must have said to themselves, âHey, itâs a   Lincoln  . This guy must be loaded.â Because they thought it necessary to estimate the cost of fixing the brakes and the window at $14,000. Ridiculous.       But I like the Explorer. Itâs pretty.       Holy shit. They actually made a Tv movie about Michael Jacksonâs adventures in pedophilia.       Okay, fine, you donât have to guess. Iâll just come out and say it.          <>I finally saw  Napoleon Dynamite !!!!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!  I loved it. The first twenty minutes just had me constantly laughing and rolling in my seat. The comedy toned down a little bit as it progressed, but thatâs because they had to make the story all pretty. I loved it.  âYour mom goes to college.â       I think that had me laughing the most. I loved Kip.       My daddy drove, which is why we actually made it to the movie. I had directions and everything.       Afterwards we all went to Eliseâs house and played with sparkly glitter glue and inflatable furniture. Really, is there anything else you need?    I love those new Comedy Central commercials that tell you to register to vote. My favorite and yours is obviously the David Cross one. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you sit your ass down in front of the Tv, turn on Comedy Central and wait as long as need be until you see it. I laughed my ass off. Seriously, my ass shot right through the chair and right through the floor into the garage.

        I woke up at 3:30AM and couldnât go back to sleep, so I thought, why not update my blog?   I'm working in the mirror on my charm.   Man, Iâm home now, and very glad to be so, Iâd say. The camping week was actually very very fun and enjoyable. I really did like it. No, really, I did. But first, the bad things.  Because Baker Lake is so far away and some people in our family are drama queens and are stupid, my younger second cousins Catherine, Addie (Who Iâm not related to, but is Catherineâs friend and has been coming to the camp-out for about seven years now), Maggie, and Justine that I always hang out with and have fun with werenât there. It sucked. Camp-out and the family Christmas party are the only times I ever get to see those guys.  Friday or Saturday, I think, my brother helped my dad and my Uncle Mick do some little chore, and as a reward, Mick tossed John a Coors Light. My parents said that he could go ahead and drink it. Dude.... fuck. Iâm 70% sure that it wasnât Johnâs first experience with alcohol, considering his punk rock lifestyle, but just the fact that my parents were okay with their eighteen-year-old son downing a silver bullet made me want to kick them in the shins. Then, in order to be equal, my mom offered me one. I just... I just wanted to vomit all over her face. Iâm sixteen! Six-fucking-teen! Iâve only been a teenager for four years and still have four years to go, and they offer me that shit? Ugh.  Iâm sorry. Camp-out is basically one big drunk-fest, so Iâve learned to not care about my parentâs drinking, but dude...  Mosquitoes were not as bad as last year, but they were still present and still made it Itchfest 2004.   She talks like I know what she's talking about.   Okay, I know Iâm going to make some enemies for this. I know some of my friends will completely doubt my sense of what good music is, but... Franz Ferdinand? Iâll pass. Okay, the way Kit and Natalie and everybody else in the fucking world talk about Franz Ferdinand, they make it seem like they are this godlike band that could make peace throughout the world by simply playing one note. But to me, they found themselves way way way below the hype. They just sound like another one of âthoseâ bands. (Other âthoseâ bands include Interpol, Rapture, and the Strokes). I wonât lie, âTake Me Out,â is fantastic and âDark of the Matinee,â and âMichael,â are both special, but overall the CD just did nothing for me. Actually, it gave me a headache while we were driving up to Baker Lake.  I could lie and just jump on the bandwagon and say that I love them, but I donât care if it makes me the uncoolest kid on this side of the Mississipâ, Iâm not gonna go to their concert. Iâm in for BK, because itâs been so long, but Franz? Sorry. Nope.  Okay, but, dude, okay, dude, whoa. Right now, since I canât do the real thing, I am hugging my two pillows and calling them Kit and Natalie. Why would I be doing this? Because of Charm School. By Bishop Allen. HOLY SHITTING JESUS! I love it. I love it all. I listened to the Cd nonstop during camp-out. Every day and night, there it was in my Cd player. I donât think I could pick a favorite if you were holding a gun to my head. I love it all like it is my own. Theyâre coming in the fall, right? RIGHT? TELL ME! Iâm in if they are.   A stranger thinking out loud in a foreign tongue.   Seriously, a lot happened over the week. So Iâm just going to try and write as much as I can. Itâs probably going to be extremely out of order, so just bear with me for a while.  John and Sarah came for the whole week this time. I really love Sarah. Not a jealous kind of love, but a brotherly kind of love. Sheâs really, a fun gal and I hope that John marries her so I can have a kick ass sister-in-law.  My cousin Megan brought her new boyfriend Jonathan. Again, I hope they get married. Jonathan is a musician and looks like what James Mercer would look like if he had red hair. I think Kit would faint at the sight of this man. He brought his acoustic guitar and graced us all to his music. His voice was crazy good. Kind of raspy and quiet and crazy pretty. And he was pretty shy, but when he talked, he was hilarious, so I loved him.  And another relationship paragraph. Adam, my cousin who I think Iâve talked about before brought his girlfriend Danni along. Before they showed up, his parents said that he was bringing his sixteen-year-old girlfriend. Adam? Heâs eighteen. I thought that was a bit creepy at first, but sheâs a really cool girl and they were cute together. Oh, wait, Adam is turning nineteen in September. Okay, that's weird. She's a sweet girl, though.   And while I knew she couldn't stay, I guess I never heard her leave.   Iâm starting to have second thoughts about this whole dating thing. I donât know, I hate feeling like Iâm missing out on something, and not dating feels like a pretty big hole in my life. If I donât have practice relationships right now, how will I know what to do when I have real relationships in the future?  Meh.  I went back to bed just now because I was getting sleepy and I wanted to think about that a little bit. I thought about it a lot, and I think the only reason I would want a girlfriend is for one thing: Having someone to hold in my arms while Iâm sitting on the couch watching television. Watching movies and Tv shows and not having to talk very loud because I could just whisper in her ear.  Whatever. Let us move on.   I'm down with you, even on the eve of destruction.   I didnât enter the horseshoe tournament this year once again, because I think that game is ridiculous and stupid. I did enter the cribbage tournament. Megan was picked as my partner and we lost our second game. Damn you Su and Karen. My brother and cousin Rachel were partners and they made it all the way up to the championship game. Then they lost. Ha. I learned how to play cribbage when I was eleven, and I entered the tournament and hey, I won. The youngest cribbage champ in the history of our camp-out, I am.   I met up with my common sense.   There was something really different about this year. Something that has never happened before. Bears! There were bears! On Tuesday morning the camp hosts found a Brown Bear cub sleeping in front of the store. They followed a trail back and found a lady who said something broke into one of her coolers. Apparently, that little bear cub opened her coolers and bit open all the beer and pop cans and drank as much as he could. He wasnât sleeping in front of the store. They learned that he was actually passed out in front of the store. I laughed so hard when I heard that. It sounded like something from right out of the Simpsons.  By the time the Fish and Wildlife people arrived at the camp, the bear had stirred. He woke up and stumbled over to the area with the cabins and showers and climbed up a tree. He was up there for about five hours just lazing around while the Fish and Wildlife people stood around and stared at it.  Later in the day, Danni went down to the area to take a shower. When she emerged all clean and sparkly, to her left was the Mommy bear. Then the baby bear ran down to the beach and the people didnât know what to do.  There were more encounters with the bears, but I want to move on once again.   At least ghosts are good company.   I won two 31 games which earned me about ten dollars in change. Perfect for poker on Saturday night. Lynn, Kim, John, Adam, Other Guy, and I were in on the action. We played some rounds of Texas Holdâem and Three Card Monty and 5 Card Draw. And I learned some really cool new games. Acey Ducey, Follow the Queen, and Shit On Your Neighbor. It was lots of fun, and I ended with about two more dollars than I started with, so Ha all over you. Friends, we need to play poker sometime. It doesnât have to be for money or anything, I have some poker chips that we could use, and Iâd teach you all I know. It would be dandy fun!   We kept playing the part where she's letting me go.   The ride home was so so so painful. Between Baker Lake and my Grandmaâs house, the police had to shut down the freeway because two guys pulled over to the side of the road and started a fist fight. But that fist fight ended with one guy getting stabbed and the other getting shot. That added an extra hour to that part of the trip. Then after a quick stop at my grandmaâs house, we headed on home. Unfortunately, there was a huge brush fire on I-5 and we were part of a complete stand-still for two hours. Everybody had turned off their engines and were just hanging out on the road and on the side of the road, waiting for them to start letting cars through. It was a pretty surreal experience to get out and walk around on a big freeway like that.  We had left Baker at noon and didnât get home until 7:00PM. It was crap.   Every single day I swore we'd eventually be penitentiary bound.   I called Robin when I got home and once again, we were going to attempt to see Napoleon Dynamite. I was optimistic that we were actually going to make it this time, since I got to Robinâs at about 9:00 and the movie was at 10:15. But nope. Joel had to go to his house to get his momâs SUV and he didnât get there until about 9:30ish. And Joel decided to take us on an adventure and take every possible wrong turn between Robinâs house and the movie theater. It was hilarious, but eventually my head started to hurt and I was hella hungry because I hadnât eaten anything since we left Baker Lake that morning.  By 10:30, we still hadnât reached Fox Tower. And we were still getting lost. So we went to get food at this place called Pizza Oasis that was really heavenly.  I think weâre going to try to see the movie again for the fourth time today. If we miss it again, Iâm giving up.   Because she sounded like a symphony when she simply said my name.   I havenât seen Jenny in a long time. I should call her. I miss her.

        Tim Burton, Disney, and Capcom are making a sequal to   The Nightmare Before Christmas   called   Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge  . And you know what is cool about it? Well, at least I think it's cool, because I'm Sir Geeksalot of Gamesingham. Yeah, it's a video game. Ps2, baby. But Tim and the people that created it are helping make it, and I watched videos and pictures of the game, and it looks just like the original movie. The only big question I have about it is the involvement of a certain Mr. Elfman. There's all new songs that everybody sings and the background music is new but it sounds like music from the movie. I just don't know if the Oingo man himself is making it. He really should.  No idea when it's coming out though. They keep pushing the release date back. And, imagine that, Buena Vista is in charge of publishing it. The same bastards that have been depriving me of   Ed Wood   for two years now. God, I hate you Buena Vista.  You know what? I can't believe that I forgot about Tim's upcoming movie.   Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  . A lot of the casting has been done. His girlyfriend Helena is going to be Mrs. Bucket. All the kids are pretty new at acting. The kid playing Charlie looks cute as hell. But it doesn't really matter who else is in the movie since Sir Deppington of Manlysville is playing the lead. He's going to steal the show.  Oh man. Ralph Fiennes (which I've discovered is pronounced something like Rafe Fines) is gonna rock. You know what I'm talkin' bout.  We went over to my aunt's house in Orenco today for dinner. Adam and his girl and I played Halo for way too long. Dude, I suck at that. But it's my brother's fault. I used to be King Killingston of Halotown. Then John took the Xbox over to Sarah's house. That was, what? Two years ago? Yeah. No joke. Even though that one Christmas that our parents gave us the Xbox, John bitched and moaned because he wanted a Gamecube instead. Then I get a Gamecube a year later, and he makes fun of me for it. But that basically sums up John.  Holy shit, that reminds me of those Subway commercials with the kid that complains that his brother used to make fun of him because he was a big, fat, fatso, fattypants. A FAT FUCK! Those were Subway, right? Anyways, I laughed a lot.  After Halo, Adam and Danni and I went over to Taco Bell. In Danni's convertable Volkswagen Cabriolet, which is a fucking cool car. I don't care if Volkswagens are primarily driven by women and considered by many to be "chick cars," I'm getting one.  Adam and I were in shock to see that Taco Bell had a brand new, only found in Taco Bells Mountain Dew. It was called Baja Bash, or something like that. I bought one and, dude, disappointing. It's like Mountain Dew mixed with Sierra Mist or some crap like that. That's the first time the fine folks at Mountain Dew have ever let me down. I love the original, I love Code Red, and I especially love my Livewire. But I guess they've run out of ideas.  But that was fun. Adam has the same taste of movies as I. He told me how since he saw the preview for it in front of   Eternal Sunshine  , he's had an uncontrollable urge to see   Garden State  .  Oh, before we left, I went to Stephen Lynch's website, because I haven't been there in a long, long, long time, and I almost pissed my hot, hot pants. There has been talk of a Stephen Lynch Dvd for many a moon now, but it's finally coming out in September. Stephen Lynch: Live at the El Ray. They have a preview of it on there of him singing Special Ed, and it's so fucking cool. After the part about getting hit in the head by Ed, he starts dancing around the stage like he's retarded, and when he returns to the microphone, he says, "I'm strong! Like Hulk! Arrr! My shoes hurt!" and then he yells out the name of the Tv show he quoted. If you don't know what he's talking about, then I dub you Sir Dumbington of Lamescatraz. Or Lady Dumington of Lamescatraz for all you lady readers. Or L.A.M.E.R.O.B.O. Unit 139485023C for all you robot readers out there. Or 1000101101001110010101 for all you binary readers.  I took that one a bit too far.  But a Stephen Lynch Dvd. It's gonna have everything he played when Kit, Ian, and I saw him in concert, and a commentary track by The Man, Mark, and Drew. Awesome, awesome, awesome. I cannot wait.  I took a big risk. A huge, huge risk. A huge, funny risk. I made my parents listen to   Superhero   on the drive out to Orenco. To my surprise, they thought he was really funny and creative, albeit crude and discgusting. I panicked about "The Best Friends Song," but luckily, my mom got lost right at the end part and turned the music down. When she found the right road, she turned it up and it was on the next song. I sighed a sigh of relief.    But all that meant no clothes shopping with Lady Kittington of Hipsterland (and her merry group of followers, Squire Nattonberg of Artsoncove and Madame Sydningsing of Sisterton). But tomorrow. For sure, tomorrow. Parents gave me $170ish. Is that enough?  And hopefully,   Garden State   tomorrow. I can't wait any longer. I just can't.  I went through my parent's Cd collection to see if there was anything that interested me, and out of about 250ish Cd's, all I found was a Tom Petty Greatest Hits, a Heart Greatest Hits, A John Lennon Greatest Hits, a Stray Cats Greatest Hits, and crap, after crap, after crap. I saw two, TWO,   FUCKING TWO! Kenny G Cd's. And Celine. And Mariah. Dude, it was gross. And I had just showered. Not cool.  Oh yeah, They Might Be Giants was awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome. They played "The End of the Tour," as they left. Perfect. I love that song with a rock hard passion. And we saw a pirate. A real pirate. Everyone was saying "ARR!" to him, so you know he was real.  My favorite Home Movies episode has always been the Summer Camp one ("I've also been wetting my pants at a fairly regular basis."), and I watched it this morning, and I recognized two familar voices that I hadn't noticed before. John and John of TMBG are the two Junior Music Counselors. They rock, they rock so hard.  I actually have some more to say, but pretzels await me downstairs. (Okay, one last one) I am Lord Hungersly of Appetitesfield.

       I'm okay now. A few serious talks with people, and I'm clear on everything and I'm okay. And I've grown to accept the blue spot. It actually looks really cool. If I can just stop listening to Roy Orbison and put in something happy happy, I'll be super fine.  But "Only the Lonely," is so pretty.  Kit sent me "The Promise," by When In Rome.  I looked everywhere for that song after hearing it at the end of  Napoleon Dynamite , but couldn't find it anywhere. I am in love with that song. All I see when I listen to it is Napoleon and Deb playing tetherball together. Happy thoughts.  Why do I have a strange impulse to call Napoleon something like Nappy D? That can't be normal.  David Cross likes TV on the Radio. I've wondered forever about what kind of music he's into. I knew his feelings about all the Creeds and Evanescences of the world, but I didn't know what he liked. Robin clipped me out this little section he had in the last Rolling Stone, and he says:   OK, now I'm going to get serious: TV on the Radio. I just say them at the Siren Festical (at Coney Island) and they were great. They were the triumphant conquerers of the day in what was a very strong lineup. Seriously, they are the next greatness.   I looked up that Siren Festival he talked about, and there were a lot of bands that played, but the ones I know of are TV on the Radio, Mission of Burma, Electric Six, The Fiery Furnaces (Eleanor!!!!), Constantines, and The Thermals. Every day I find more reasons to love that little bald man.  I can only dream that someday, someday, he'll tour with the Shins. It's not that farfetched of an idea, they're both a part of the SubPop family and he toured as the opening act with Ultrababyfat. It should happen. Maybe I'll e-mail somebody about that.  My brother brought back the Clerks Cartoons from Sarah's house! God damn, that made me a happy camper today. I listened to all of the episodes with the commentary. Most of it was them making fun of ABC and the people that ran it. And all the ridiculous censoring that ABC put on the show. Like turning Jay and Silent Bob into fireworks salesmen instead of drug dealers. And all the little jokes they had to cut out because ABC thought that someone would sue them, even though they didn't hold a candle to the things "South Park," has gotten away with.  But I wish they could've continued that show. They talked about this idea they had where Randal finds Kit (the car from "Knightrider") at a used car lot and buys it. Kit becomes jealous of Randal's friendship with Dante and plans to kill Dante and steal his identity (a  Single White Female  parody). So then they'd have Kit, dressed up as Dante, behind the counter of the Quik Stop, and nobody notices the difference. It's gold, man.    John and Sarah took me to see  Napoleon Dynamite  again. I was sitting next to Sarah and felt a bit uncomfortable laughing at the cow scene. She's a vegan, you see. And this time, since it's playing at local theaters now, it had the wedding scene afterwards. I won't say who gets married in case someone doesn't want the surprise ruined, but I will say that the guy that shoots the cow is the priest and there is a kick ass song sung by the groom.  The Magnetic Fields are so cool. They have this song on Volume 2 of  69 Love Songs  called "Love is Like Jazz." They have bongos and an accordian and a cadre of other instruments all playing different tunes while the non-Stephin guy sings lyrics like, " Love is like jazz. You make it up as you go along and you act as if you really know the song... but you don't."  Picture Time  Here's my new wall:     It looks kind of cool. A bit crooked, but hey, who cares? That's also what I drew last class.     We had to draw a quick, normal self portrait, then draw on some guidelines to change the angles and sizes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Then we folded it into four quarters. We spent 20 minutes drawing each quarter, and while you were drawing one, you couldn't look at any of the other quarters to see if the lines matched up or if the shading matched up. It was fun.     I like the little eye the best. That was the first part I drew. It bugs me how the guidelines for the eyes and mouth are still there, but I erased and I erased but they wouldn't go away.  This is one of my other drawings that I made. I don't like it as much.     It just looks too sad. It wasn't supposed to be that sad. Originally he was really happy, and then we had to change the drawing somehow over and over and over, and eventually the only way I could change it was to make him sad. And then class ended. But still, it's pretty good considering that at one time it was a man with an elephant's trunk and big elephant ears. You see that dark curve going from his eye down to his shoulder? That was it.     I was really proud of the nose, though.  I might as well add this. One of my most prized possessions:     Oh yeah. The book. Jealous?  And since I mentioned the Fiery Furnaces...     Hoooooohman.

       Remember that thing on my back that moved in and decided to make my back numb and make me freak out? No? Well, that happened in early June. And guess what? It came back. Thereâs no doubt that it is in the exact same spot, so unless we have some spiders that are obsessive compulsive, I donât think that itâs a spider bite.  So mum took me to the doctor to get it checked out. Seriously, I am so sick of going to that place. Itâs headaches, itâs my weight, itâs my back, itâs my allergies, itâs blah blah blah blah. My regular doctor wasnât there so I got to meet with this really cool Jewish guy. Dr... Brody, I think. He looked at it and didnât know what it was. So he went and got another doctor to get a second opinion. The reason they thought it wasnât a spider bite was because it didnât hurt or itch at all, it showed up in the exact same spot twice, and the way it felt wasnât like normal bites. So I never really got a clear answer on what it was. But he thought there was some kind of fluid inside it so he cut it open to drain it. Itâs really icky.  So that was... what? Wednesday? Yes. The discoloration is still there, but it isn't swelled up or anything. If it comes back, I swear to God, I'm going to do something. Yeah, I'll do something. I know what you're saying. "Oh, he's lazy. He won't do anything." But if you think that, you'll be wrong. Because I....  Jesus, I'm glad I stopped myself on that one. I had about three more paragraphs worth of the rambles.  I saw The Village. I don't get why everybody hates it. I mean, yes, it wasn't that scary. Perhaps overall the trailers for the film were scarier than the movie itself, which was misleading to some. But I loved it. I loved it just as much as The Sixth Sense, and Signs, and most of all, Unbreakable. Unbreakable is my favorite M. Night movie, even though it wasn't scary at all. I love it because it's a great story. It's fiction, but it's presented in a realistic fashion. The directing was trÃ©s chouette. That's what The Village was. There were a couple parts in the movie that made me think the ending was going to be horrible, but that went away when the ending finally came. And all the questions and disagreements I had with the story were answered at the end.  But it was good. I say it was good, and so it is. Why didn't you guys like it? (Answers would be very nice.)  "Sometimes we stop doing things we want to do so other people won't know that we want to do them. "  EDIT: I'm done with that crap.  I'm really proud of the picture I drew in class yesterday.

       Saw  Garden State . I thought it was completely worth the wait. Seriously, great, great movie. The story was perfect, how everything wasn't revealed all at once. When "Caring is Creepy," played, I was seriously this close to tears. I couldn't believe that there were people all over the world, in film festivals and movie theaters, hearing James' voice. And then Zach decided to dedicate an entire scene to "New Slang." God, he just sat and listened to a song. It wasn't just background music like every other song in every other movie, Zach made it a part of the story. He thought it was such a great song that he had to make an obvious point that he liked it and that it'll change your life. The directing... well, every shot looked like as he had gone through his life, he was always thinking that if he had a camera, something would make a really great shot, and he finally got the chance to shoot them and combine them all and make a fantastic looking movie.  I need to watch more Peter Sarsgaard. I remember him being completely compelling and great in  Shattered Glass , but that's all I've seen of him.  But, it was weird. I know it was pretty and a love story and it had a happy ending and nobody died (well, none of the main characters died), but it hit me different than other love stories have in the past. Like I've been watching  Punch Drunk Love  on a fairly regular basis ever since it returned from Sarah's house, and everytime it ends I just smile and smile and I'm happy because it's so pretty.  Garden State  was equally pretty, but the end result left me really down, and I'm trying to figure out why. I loved the movie and I know it should make me happy like everything else, but it just didn't. When I got home, I just turned on The Living End and climbed into bed. I didn't even talk to any of my family, I just wanted to fall asleep. I hate being like that.  Maybe I just need to take a break from love for a while. Maybe I need to put away  Punch Drunk Love  and  Lost in Translation  and stop reading  Shopgirl  and just bury it in with my other books so I'm not tempted to pick it up again and stop listening to  69 Love Songs   and crank up Tom Petty or Starlight Mints or something    . Maybe I just need to spend the next few days playing Far Cry and Doom 3 and just forgetting about everything. Or at least trying. I don't know if it'll work, but I'm up for anything.  I also got new clothes yesterday, thanks all to Kit and Sydney. I thought they looked fine in the dressing rooms, but I guess everything looks good in the dressing rooms. The pants all fit fine, and it's awesome that I now have pants that actually fit me and I don't have to rely on a shoddy belt to keep myself from exposing my bottom parts. But maybe it's just me, but I still hate my body and think that the shirts hang out in the back and look ridiculous. Why isn't it like that on anybody else? When I walk down the street everybody has trim fitting shirts that look nice on them. I just want to blend in with those people at least once.  The sheep sweater is really small. I love it but, Syd, I think you'll get more use out of it. And you found it, so you deserve it.  Really icky right now.  But it'll get better. When I grow up, I'll be fine and happy.  I watched  Super Size Me  yesterday, and there's lots of things I want to talk about that, but I'm not feeling up to it right now.  Oh, by the way, this is my 25th blogger entry. I stopped liking blogger at about the 15th entry, but I promised myself that I would at least keep it going until number 25. My next blog entry will be back on my home turf of xanga.
