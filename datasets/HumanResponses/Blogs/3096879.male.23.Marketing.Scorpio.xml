       It is Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s birthday today.  He would have been 104 years old.  Despite being one of the greatest author’s I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading, he lived an extraordinary life as well.  Most of us know him for  The Little Prince , however, most of his other novels were related to his life as a pilot—an extremely lonely, beautiful, adventurous and strenuous life all the same.  These books show us the fantasy of being a modern-day wanderer while sticking to the reality of flying at the same time.   The wandering theme—something I’ve grown accustomed to throughout the years in my readings of great novels, show us the beauty of being human, the fantastic experience of the seeker, and the desperation of really living life to its fullness.  Going back to  The Little Prince ; we find that this very same theme applies.  However, unlike many adult human beings, the protagonist in question seeks only to find experience with his immediate environment.  He finds every aspect of his surroundings interesting and vitally important.  He looks at the world through the eyes of a true wanderer: he finds beauty in all things.  If only we could also find similar beauty in the things we see and feel and experience in our own lives.  Now wouldn’t that be a most extraordinary happening.  On that note, a quote from The Little Prince:  “Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is exhausting for children to have to provide explanations over and over again.” Thanks to Richard Howard’s translation.

         quotable  Shaq announces he's definitely leaving the Lakers organization next season because he wants to "play for a team that's willing to win." However, what I found so interesting was his final quote to ESPN.com --    "But can't nobody [mess] with me. I'm like toilet paper, Pampers and toothpaste. I'm definitely proven to be effective."   urlLink full story

       I finished watching this film with a new sense of awe for American cinema.  Notwithstanding the phenomenal cast of characters, this film seems to define--in my opinion--everything good and true in modern cinema.  Filmed in the mid-sixties,  urlLink It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World  follows a dynamic hodgepodge of men and women who are searching for a recently deceased man's buried treasure of $350,000.  Of course, an awesome display of quarky incidents fill in the blanks between the beginning of this race to the end.  I won't even mention all of the films that have taken on this same theme since this movie.  I am simply posting this in order to beg all of you to see it.  I have never laughed so intensly.  Kudos to  urlLink Stanley Kramer  for directing this fine film!

      Unfortunately,  urlLink Lollapalooza  has been canceled due to low ticket sales.  I was fairly anxious for having a chance to see Morrissey live, however, it seems that simply won't happen at this point.        urlLink Morrissey  has been nothing less than a hero in my mind--his music, his lyrics, his complete persona, encapsulate everything good and true in music.  He is honest, sincere and genuine with every lyric.  His absolute sense of reality paves a revolutionary way towards real music.  Music that not only tells a story, not only tells events and actions, but tells them honestly and with vigor.  Morrissey is the reality that we all live everyday.  And he's not afraid to speak about it.  I will miss him in concert.

            Is Google's new Gmail system invading your privacy?   I've recently obtained three  urlLink Gmail  accounts via user invitations ( urlLink anonymous.kook@gmail.com , my personal account;  urlLink zshop.sales@gmail.com , my new business account for  urlLink Amazon ; and  urlLink valid.email.address@gmail.com , my account for when I simply need a &quot;valid Email address&quot; to register.)&nbsp; &gt;:)  Gmail is still in its Beta phase, meaning, it's not been released fully and is still being tested.&nbsp; The best way to test something is to create a market to do the work for you, so, Google has made an invitation only based system.&nbsp; I've been lucky enough to get three invites so far and will continue to check for more, however, I'm sure the full version will be released soon anyway.   After doing a bit of research on Gmail, I've noticed that it has been the product of heavy scrutiny.&nbsp;Websites such as  urlLink gmail-is-too-creepy.com  have been quite outspoken with their fears of Google's ability to invade our valuable privacy.&nbsp; I, however, agree with  urlLink Tim O'Reilly --a computer book publisher and owner of a large network which discusses topics such as the one we're discussing now!--who basically says that all Email providers have the same ability to peruse our secrets as Google does.&nbsp; Spam filters, virus scanners and other similar anti-hacking technologies do this everyday. See his full story  urlLink here .  So why all the fuss about Google?&nbsp; Gmail introduces a new technology, previously unavailable to Email accounts.&nbsp; This technology allows users to search for multiple prior Emails, or &quot;conversations&quot; as Google puts it, much the same as one would search for something on Google.&nbsp; Not only can you search for certain ideas and/or certain discussions with specific people, but everything you search for is archived.&nbsp; That way, you no longer have to go through all of your Email with your best friend to find that interesting topic you just have to read again.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that users get 1000MB of space.&nbsp; I for one, think this technology is revolutionary.&nbsp;   But I hope I'm not the only one asking Google this: &quot;Now that we have Gmail, how long until Gchat?&quot;

      These are all of my  urlLink Xanga  posts--as I've moved over here now:  I recently submitted this short story to another  urlLink blog  and will receive another  urlLink Gmail  account for it.  The only requirements were the story had to be over 300 words and had to incorporate five words (below shown in bold).              He could not explain the obtrusive commercial element engrossing the television in his environmentally friendly, loft-style suite.  “Always low prices.  Always.”               “Always low prices, indeed!” thought Ralph Nader with a snarl.  “I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again!  ‘Wal-Mart is a cancer on the economy!’”              Ralph quickly left the room in a huff and ventured toward the island in his kitchen—a regular paradise surrounded by a vast array of gizmos and gadgets even Bill Gates himself could not understand.  On top of the center piece, in a ceramic bowl painted red, were three ripe bananas.  Eagerly, Ralph pealed a banana—the plumpest in the bunch—and proceeded to engulf it like, perhaps, a gorilla in the wild, eating under immense pressure.                “Why, I wonder what the ‘Mayor of Baghdad’ would do in a time like this!  This is crucial!  This plague on society will not stand!”  Ralph wielded his half-eaten banana in the air like some dim-witted knight’s apprentice would wield a blunt sword in the heat of battle.  “By God!  I’ve got to get out of here quick!”              Like Batman out of the Bat Cave, Ralph sped out of his garage and off his remote estate in a flash.  He was headed for the airport.               “I have to leave the country,” he thought, as he sped down some highway not meant for human travel.  “Yeah, that’ll be my salvation.”              In his newly acquired H2, Ralph flies down the highway at unclockable speeds.  As the trees passing by become a blur, he pops up his handy-dandy passenger seat laptop and attempts to connect to the Internet.  He wishes to check the latest news at  urlLink RalphDontRun.Net .  Unfortunately for him, however, Internet Explorer seems to be down.               “Damn this thing!  And damn Gates!” he screams as he quickly turns back to the road.  “Ten more miles and I’ll be at the airport!  That’s hardly enough time for Netscape to boot up!  If only there was a browser which was both user-friendly and efficient!”               Ralph hastily shoved his laptop out of the way as he pulled into his less-than-private docking station at whatever airport he was at (we can’t exactly say or the terrorists win).  A dozen or so supporters raised “Nader in 2004” signs high up in the air.  With a smile, Ralph thought “Wow!  Every last one of my supporters all gathered here to see me off!”   The smile faded as he realized he’d forgotten his wallet at his environmentally friendly, loft-style suite.  Fortunately for him, he was wearing his favorite navy sport jacket.  The same jacket he was wearing just a month ago on a flight to one of the top five major cities in the nation (again, we can’t exactly say or the terrorists win).  On this specific flight, a famous ditzy celebrity spotted some dark-skinned foreigner.  She threw a fit and spouted off about all of her eager-for-revenge attorneys and with that, the plane landed at the nearest airport and the poor dark-skinned man was arrested for violation of some obscure provision under the Patriot Act (later that day, some tyrannical Patriot Act Enforcer shoved bamboo shoots up his fingernails).   With a newly acquired sense of encouragement, Ralph waltzed into the airport lobby and rode the moving floor down to the popular airline that gave him a substitute ticket—given his run-in with what must have been a terrorist—on the previous flight.  As he approached the airline attendant, he pulled the neatly folded ticket out of his favorite navy sport jacket and placed it firmly on the desk in front of him.   With a smirk, the airline attendant informed Ralph that the ticket “expired last week.”  “What!” started Ralph, “There’s no way this is an expired flight ticket!  I received it just last month!”  “Sorry Mr. Nader—and by the way, my sister-in-law’s cousin’s boyfriend’s mother is a stocker at a Super Wal-Mart, you insensitive goon—the ticket is expired.  That’s how we do things around here.”  “Oh is it?”  “Yep.”  “Okay, ma’am—and forget what I said about Wal-Mart: I was drunk—how can I purchase a new ticket?”  Suddenly, a ring was heard throughout the airport.  “What was that?!” screeched Ralph with a shudder.  “Oh.  That.  Yes, Mr. Nader, that is our new anti-terrorist ring.  It’s supposed to deter the bastards by reminding them of…uh…something-or-other…  I…I just can’t remember exactly what that something-or-other is.”  “Right.  Can we just move on with the ticket?”  “Yes, Mr. Nader.  Let me just connect us to the Internet.  Yes, here we are.  One way or roundtrip, Mr. Nader?”  “What?  I thought IE was down.  And there’s no way Netscape came through that fast.”  “Well of course not, sir, because we use neither.  The new Firefox is both user-friendly and efficient.”  “Well, bouncing bananas!” shouted Ralph, “I suppose I’ll get that ticket yet, thanks to Firefox!”  “Yes sir, as long as you have a major credit card.”  Ralph’s face became long.  “You do have a major credit card don’t you Mr. Nader?”   Ralph turned pale as he did an about face and briskly exited the airport.  In other news: I might move over to Blogger, as there are simply far more options in utilizing its services.  I will attempt to update this as much as possible and use it as a forum for friends and family--although, I haven't given the link to anyone yet, so none of them--if anyone--will see this post.  lol.  Sunday, June 13, 2004  	Yeah.  So I haven't been able to access the Web at all lately.  I'm now in Missouri and we have a cable connection which is just about twice the speed of the cable at my house in Bedford, though, I have to wait for a wireless adapter card.  Meanwhile, I'm stuck here on a 24" flat panel screen in the office ("boo hoo" -- yeah right!).   Anyway, when I can get my own setup back, I'll keep this thing updated regularly!  Sunday, May 23, 2004  I've been unbelievably busy lately.&nbsp; But for you people who actually look at my thrills and spills, I'll attempt to continue to update it as often as I can.&nbsp; Last weekend I went to Lake Whitney (Whitney, TX) with some friends.&nbsp; Here's a shot from the thirty-foot cliffs we were diving off of (click image for full sized version):&nbsp;   urlLink     Fun stuff.&nbsp; I'm at a loss as to what I did prior to last weekend--it's simply been too long.&nbsp; However, the present weekend--now just ending--has been fun.&nbsp; Yesterday, me and my best friend David hustled a museum (we snuck in) and had lunch at a great restaurant in Fort Worth: Lucille's.&nbsp;During the evening I went to a dance benefit deal which was quite entertaining.&nbsp; I sat through part of the movie Pi at Johnny's today.&nbsp;Although I did roll my eyes at many situations in the film, I must admit the camera work is damn good.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the ideas and philosophy behind it simply aren't as revolutionary as the film seems to think.&nbsp; I might be going to Mexico next weekend, though plans aren't certain at this point.&nbsp; I might also be traveling to Wisconsin for a job that has come up.&nbsp; That's about it, really.  That should be enough archiving...  It's all new stuff from here on out!

           Alright, so I don't want to have to wait another year to basically say that Aldous Huxley has been an immense impact on my life. His birthday was yesterday, 1856.            Brave New World  impacted me heavily as a child and I think that my current interest in the trends in science--the idea that science has become a conquering machine (alla Descartes; cf. his  Discourse on Method  Book Six), i.e., technological and ultimately sophistical rather than simply inquiry. Aristotle noted that science should be in the form of an attempt to understand the physical world (cf. his  Physis ), however, that idea has long since gone awry and most noticeable of this is the idea that technology is somehow equal to science.     But this is going away from the subject. Huxley means a great deal to me and because he touched me so early in life, I will share with you an essay I wrote about  Brave New World  waaaay back in ninth grade (freshman year of high school) for my English GT class. I will note that I recovered this essay a few years ago from a disk I used in high school from an old Macintosh machine. Evidently, I did the cover page at home (I tended to print very lavish cover pages as opposed to the minimal textual norm) and have since lost it, given there have been several new machines flowing through my house since then. Anyway, so to make a long story short, I don't have any recollection of what the essay was called. So, I'll just call it "Huxley Essay." Yeah. And here it is:    "Huxley Essay" -- circa 1995                      What separates human beings from other mammals?    Both have minds, instinct, capacity for knowledge, and most distinguishing, choices.    But man began with a little something extra, something that delegates guilt, expresses powerful emotional feelings, restores faith, and creates a conscience; that something is the soul.    Through technology and science, man uses his drive for knowledge to create mechanical and chemical objects and science related formulas, all this to ease the difficulty of life.    Once this is done, man begins to get selfish desiring machines called computers to do all the work for them, programming the machines to do as man wills.    Once man has developed enough technology, his leaders begin to hold back information, because with knowledge comes power, and to keep this power, man must restrain man; is technology the pathway to digression?                                    W  A  R                                     During World War Two Adolf Hitler seized control of Germany as a whole by keeping the Germans at distance with the truth.    Hitler controlled the BBC radio lines throughout the entire country, filling it with Nazi propaganda and false news reports that always favored the Germans.    This increased Hitler's political power and the morale of his soldiers, giving him the upper hand in the war.    George Orwell published this same theory fictionally in his future-fantasy classic,  1984 .              "And somehow or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laid out the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence" (Orwell 38).                                 Orwell used this same basic principle to not only give false news reports (of a false war), but also to falsify life itself, erasing history and creating a history in accordance with  Big Brother .     1984  used the motto; "War is peace…    Freedom is slavery…    Ignorance is strength" quite frequently in the novel (Orwell 7).    Orwell used "War is Peace" to support the nature of power over the weak in the novel.    Explaining that with a constant state of war, there is greater peace in the community as everyone unites to become one strong force and forget any petty arguments.    The state can also control the public easier and ration their needs.    "Freedom is slavery" gives a need for control and "Ignorance is strength" strives on stupidity to control.                                 U            T            O            P            I            A              An overwhelming drive exists between the thoughts of the common man and the nobility of the exceptional, through which an entire realm of absurd intelligence that is marked by the futile as insolence and ambiguity is compensated.    Social class and physical stasis embellish the thoughts of the weak and degenerate.    The idea of inferiority surpassing the physical superior is beyond insipid and falls under the inane category of impossible.    This is all considered by our standards to be an absolute absurdity, but it occurs currently; has occurred in the past, and will most definitely dominate the future as we know it.    The path to digression is absolute, for with the growth of man comes the growth of mentality.    This drives man to corruption, for there is an underlining climax to the growth and definition of mentality: corruption.    The denouement is only the end of mental salvation, however.    It is the beginning of menial civilization.    "BNW is a benevolent dictatorship: a static, efficient, totalitarian welfare state" (Pearce, 8).          Power under any circumstance involves the progression of the mind, the mind being human, and the human being instinctually selfish.    In this post-Darwinian society that we live in, mankind has realized that there is something more to life than evolution,    that something happens to be the soul.    And, as modern scientists have come to theorize, the soul is but a gateway to the mind, and the mind has overwhelming potential for brilliance.    Thus, the conquering of the mind can only be rendered by the mind itself.         To conquer the mind takes absolute precision.    Aldous Huxley, author of  Brave New World,  seems to do a brilliant job of describing just how to do so.    In his world, life begins with the chemical manipulation of the brain.    This tampering of the mind is the simplest solution.    Although Huxley takes it further, utilizing basic manipulation and the theory of collectivism to establish unity in his world.    They are taught to need one another, to want what they've got; they are  taught  happiness.         Once the mind has arrived at a certain point, it searches for power.    To gain this power involves conquering the feeble minded.    Once this is done, the mind moves on to  creating  the feeble minded, and then it has total control.    Once it has reached this point, it must retain stability and ensure the succession of future generations to follow in its footsteps.    This is the point at which (the only conceivable) Utopia is met.    However, upon realizing this, Utopia seems not to be the perfect community, but only a lie.                         <>               T  H  E                                   H    E   R     O        The use of the hero in BNW employs the basic concept of realism aligned with the fanatic views of the Utopian landscape.    It agrees with the denial of such a place, and provides a dwelling for true humanity.    The meaning of the hero is not to prevail in the end, but to suffer the consequences of humanity, to be human and become corrupt and conform, and to show true humanity realize this corruption and give in to its painful punishment, the absence of life.    The only way to truly be alone was to become nothing, to die.    John killed himself in the end, not to give up, but to truly prove his humanity, his truth.             The only way to justify the hero's role is to understand the reasoning behind its origin.    One must evaluate not only the occurrences in BNW, but also the logic behind them.    John suffered the ultimate pain, death; but he chose this fate, something that the people in the "Other Place" could never do.    John was truly human and was truly human up to his death.    This is why he was the hero in the novel.    Huxley used him as the symbol of all truth and humanity in BNW; and considered it lost and found the same through the course of the book.    The outstanding quest that John faced was evident and vital to the basic ideals and theories of the novel.         In BNW Huxley centers his hero among the outcasts of society, a hero among nonconformity, a hero against conformity, and a hero who lacks the qualities of his future Utopian land, but sustains the quality of true intellect.    This ensures the establishment of conflict throughout his novel, and he is the man who proves to the reader that what is marked, as a Utopia is completely wrong.             This hero, John the Savage, cannot conquer the powers that be; and he does not prevail in the end, for John gives in to the conformity, but when he realizes this, he hangs himself.    Huxley's hero is corrupted in some sense, and in another he prevails and gives some definition to the novel.    John symbolizes all that is good in the "real world."    John is a true hero.                       When John emerges from the savage land he is confused and misguided as to the truth of the world of Mustopha Mond.     He was brought up to believe that the "Other Place [was a place where] everybody happy and no one ever sad or angry, and every one belonging to every one else…and the happiness being there everyday…" (Huxley 129). And when he heard the news that he was to see this "Other World" he leapt up to grasp the very idea, his eyes lighting up in a most astounding manner, "O wonder!    How many beauteous goodly creatures are there here!    How beauteous mankind is!    O brave new world that has such people in it" (Huxley 141).                       John ventures to the "Other Place" and finds that it is not quite what he had in mind.    Sure there was no pain, all happiness, and all clean and attractive.    But it lacked one quality that was vital to him and his fellow old-worlders: truth.    No true happiness, true lifestyles, or true attractive.    London was only a world of robots programmed to do what Mond wanted them to do for the rest of their brief life.    His confusion erupted further when Lenina continued to attempt to seduce him; and although he was very attracted to her he would not give in to her vast attempts at taking him.    "The Savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands away from his shoulders, thrust her roughly away at arm's length…    'Whore!    Impudent strumpet'" (Huxley 198).    John grew to hate the "Other Place" and ventured forth to change it.    But he failed as Mond repeatedly denied him any of his intelligible logic, as he attempted to warn the inhabitants of what was becoming of them, as he continued to deny any sexual connotation, without love and promise, to Lenina.         <>                    R   E    L    I    G           I            O            N                A         N            D                     S            O            M            A           The advance of technology defaces religion and creates a world absent from God.    To gain total control of a community the leader must retain all ideas that might catalyze thoughts and create individualism.     By doing this, the leader must diminish god altogether because his people must worship  their leader .    "God isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness" (Huxley 240).    Mustopha Mond definitely rids the world of god by saying this to John the Savage.    This is the definitive, crucial part of the takeover of society.             However, without god, man cannot have faith, an important value of humanity.    Without faith, one must argue whether or not retaining a soul is even possible.    "A gramme is better than a damn" (Huxley 54).    This quote refers to "Soma" the drug used in BNW to cure the ailing of boredom, any amount of pain, or uncomfortableness.    Like religion (Christianity being my prime example), Soma gives some sort of hope and cure to problems that the people of BNW go through.    However, this breach of hope is only temporary, for permanent problems are not even a threat or a thought away to the society.    "Ending is better then mending" is a similar quote that provides a sense of temporary satisfaction (Huxley 52).                                                 R            O            B            O            T            I            C           I            n            d            I            v            I            d            u            a            l            s                    Individualism brings about an important issue when analyzing the future of our world.    Technology has already begun to downgrade past creative outlets.    Computers assist drawings, where the hand used to be the key tool.    Will movies become strictly computer generated in the years to come?    What about radio (techno, industrial, electronica, etc.)?         Without individualism and the ascension of collectivism, come robotic non-human beings under the control of the leader.    "Hungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough" (Huxley 265).    This lack of empathy provides obvious non-human qualities and presents a society that resembles the tribal frightenment and digression posed in William  Golding's   Lord of the Flies .    The processes of digression resemble that of BNW, but on a smaller scale.    Young boys isolated on a remote island, lacking any inhabitants other then swine, try to develop a government fairly, but only end up in war and ignorance.    Certain themes flow through the novel that relates directly to the society in BNW.    S ociety without hope:  Lord of the Flies  depicts a society who is trapped and isolated on a distant island; they’re morale is lost when their only hope for rescue is gone.    The society deteriorates morally and socially, and anarchy reigns.    Rules are broken, and thus, chaos is served.    The beast within: human instinct, wrath, corrupts and encompasses the minds of the imaginative after hope has been stricken from them.    Temporary pleasure: the boys would rather hunt and kill and have fun then focus on preparation to be rescued.          Huxley attempts to conceive the evolution of the world as a neurotic self-centered, government of fascism, ruling a community of infantile subhuman followers.    This community thrives on "unity" and "stability" and abolishes individualism altogether, propagating collectivism, enhancing the powers of the leaders, and preparing them for world dominance.    Science and technology elude the minds of the weak, decreasing any hope of perpetration of retaliation.    This enforces confusion that withholds courage and desire to wreak havoc in the world state to achieve the life that they deserve to live.          However, none of this really matters, for the inhabitants of BNW do not actually  live , for they are programmed how to live, as if they were mere cyborgs under the control of the programmers.              "Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled” (Huxley 231).                   This quote, spoken to John the Savage from the leader, Mustopha Mond, proves my point justly.    He wants to keep his superiority superior so he demolishes the capability of learning, escalating only his brilliance so that he can keep a firm grasp on his community.    "The optimum population is modeled on the iceberg- 8/9s below the water line, 1/9 above" (Huxley 230).    This is a perfect model, spoken by Mustopha Mond, to evaluate the true desires of Mond in his endless battle to keep control of his world.         Although this seems somewhat twisted and sick, the paradox of digression through evolution of technology is only a step away.    In modern society, our scientists have come up with magic potions and spells to cure the ailing, supernatural flying machines to conquer neighboring lands, and super intelligence machines linked to anything and everything conceivable.    This constitutes the very fabric that our world has been threading for centuries, the cures for: war, famine, hardships, etc.    Huxley's world engages in no war, is superfluously satisfied, and diminishes hardships altogether.    A world of epoch proportions is this BNW, a seemingly Utopia of perfection, save one important factor: individualism.         Our current world status formulates a postulate including the realm of science and the realm of creativity; for without the latter, what would be interesting in this world?    Knowledge is power, and to gain power one must limit the amount of knowledge given to the weak.    This is done out of instinct, however, is it just?    Will the downfall of our society be the corruption of the human being's instinctive prowess?    Technology seemingly only helps that statement; Huxley may have a critical point that we as human beings should begin to realize.

      Why is it that everytime I go to a used bookstore, there's always a long-haired geek in his mid-twenties, yabbering on and on about some sort of Fantasy Cycle, consisting of Halflings and other equally hideous creatures, only some mutant God would have the sense of humor to create? And alone, for fuck's sake; laughing and giggling with himself like some sort of depraved acid flashback.  These same lowly beings are the absolute cream of the coffeeshop crop.  They flaunt around like wild animals in the darkness, playing live-action Vampire, leaving D & D to the younger breed.  But in the wee hours of the night, that perpetual hour of stillness, they content themselves with flippant desires of abstract cool.  Anti-name brand labels and facial hair abound as their inflated egos engulf everyone and everything in their immediate vicinity.     Er...  Now that I think about it.  I've been known to play a bit of D&D, and just recently I started playing LORD (Legend of the Red Dragon) again on a Telnet BBS.  Oh yeah, and there was that time I read the entire Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in an Internet chatroom.  Urg.  Well, at least I'm not using Vampire LiveRoleplay as a means to get laid!  Yeah, and all that.

       "Save With a 0% APR FOR LIFE!*"    I'll get to the footnote in a moment. This is Discover Card's new can't-beat-it deal. The idea is that you transfer a high balance from one card with a higher interest rate to your new Discover card for the low price of $29 max (which, as far as balance transfer fees are concerned, is pretty low: they generally range from nothing--Citibank never charges a balance transfer fee--to $29, to $35, to $50 max). From the surface it seems like a great deal, however, let's look now at that footnote:    " DEFAULT RATE : If you are late making a payment, any introductory/special rates terminate and the standard purchase APR will apply to purchases and balance transfers. If you fail twice to make a required payment when due or if you exceed your account credit limit twice, your purchase APR will be increased to 19.99%. If you fail 3 times to make a required payment when due or if you exceed your account credit limit 3 times, your purchase APR and cash advance APR will be increased to 24.99%. See Cardmember Agreement for details."  The idea here is that you should NEVER, under ANY circumstances be late for a payment or exceed your account limit. There are two general rules I abide by in order to ascertain I do neither of these things: 1) I use  online bill-pay  for all of my credit cards, and 2) I simply structure my  spending limit  each month.       Online Bill-Pay  seems to be the most efficient means of paying a bill in the modern age we live in. Firstly, the payment takes two to three days to post, whereas mailed in statements can take up to ten days (this, of course, includes shipment, processing and non-extenuating delays. Secondly, due to enhanced security features on the Internet, it has proven more difficult for third parties to retrieve sensitive data. Not only that, but if you'll notice, a user's account numbers are generally X'ed out and instead he/she is assigned some sort of online account number to further prevent hacking. Once you've set up your online bill-pay, generally you are further assigned a username and password to be associated with your account. However, since your bank account information is also being used in order to pay your bill, always make sure you log out as soon as you authorize your payment--this will ensure the maximum amount of security on your behalf. Thirdly, online bill-pay is obviously far more convenient than traditional payment methods, given there are no checks involved, no stamps or envelopes and no phone calls to be made. Just log into your account, click to pay, and authorize. Bam! You're done in thirty seconds.  By ensuring my  spending limit , I am more apt to abide by my credit limitations. I've really never had a problem with this personally, however, I've been known to have the opposite problem--my credit limits are so high that I feel I can spend more and more money that I don't have. In order to rectify this, I have set strict regulations on my cards.  That's easy enough, so what's the catch?    Well, along with maintaining a timely payment and not exceeding your credit limit, there is one more stipulation which must be met in order to keep the 0% APR for life. That is, the cardholder must make two "Required Transactions" every month. Seems easy, right? Well, the idea here is that the cardholder will--instead of merely making two transactions--use the card regularly. Of course, then, the cardholder is being charged with the Prime Rate plus between 6.99% and 11.99% (making the estimated APR between 10.99% and 15.99%). Remember, it is assumed that one pays off an earlier purchase before a later one. So, in this case, every purchase the cardholder makes will be accruing interest until the initial balance transfer is paid off.   Not only that, but this particular card calculates its balance for purchases using the Two-cycle Average Daily Balance (including new purchases) method. This method computes the average balance over the course of two months instead of one. So, let's say you make a purchase of $800 and at the end of the month you pay off $400 of the total charge. The next month you will find that you have accumulated interest on the initial balance plus part of the $400 you paid off! Of course, this method really has no bearing on this particular card, given you'll be accruing interest on all of your transactions anyway (unless you plan to pay off your balance transfer in the first month or so, defeating the purpose of making said transfer).   This particular card is one of those situations, however, where one can really make out if disciplined. Despite all of the negative connotations listed above, if the cardholder was to simply buy a pack of gum twice a month, the interest accrued would be pale in comparison to the savings earned from the interest rate of the previous card. But a word of caution: one forgetful month or one delayed transaction, or as we stated above, one missed payment or one transaction that exceeds your credit limit, bumps the APR from 0% to 19.99% or 24.99%. My friends, that risk I am not willing to take.    What other preventative measures can I take when applying for a card?     Be wary of any 0% APR or other super low APR .   If you cannot pay off your debt within the time period allocated, the rates will sky rocket immensely and you'll find yourself working hard just to pay off the interest. Make sure you know exactly when your rates will change so that you can mark a time to call and ask to maintain an interest reduction--ensure that this time period is no more than two months and no less than one month from the date in which your APR is set to change. As an example, I called my AT&T Universal Card and asked if I could maintain my 0% APR for an extended length of time. I received six more months of interest free periods instead of what would have changed to Prime plus 8.99% (about 12.99%). Not only that, but the account specialist I was dealing with invited me to call in about four months or so to see if I could further extend this rate. I hope to have my balance paid in full by then, however, it is refreshing to see that these card companies are willing to work with you.      Always pay close attention to the "Schumer Box,"  located along with the other fine-print with your initial credit card offer. This chart must be included, by law, with every credit card application due to the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act. It basically provides a summary of all costs and fees associated with the credit card. It will give you the APR for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (introductory and default). Your Variable Rate information will be available, the method by which balance for purchases is computed, and the Grace Period for repayment. It will also let you know of any fees associated with balance transfers and cash advances. Late fees, overdraft fees, and fees associated with exceeding your credit limit will also be displayed. Also, if there is an annual fee, it will be displayed.     That's a lot to look out for. Can you further explain exactly what I should be looking for?    Following is a summary of every cost associated with most major credit cards:    Interest Rate   All credit card companies will charge you an interest rate for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. The monthly rate is called the monthly periodic rate and is calculated by simply dividing the annual rate by twelve. The annual rate is called the Annual Percentage Rate. Most companies quote the Annual Percentage Rate versus the monthly periodic rate.   Annual Percentage Rate (APR)   APR's can be Fixed or Variable, or both. If the initial offer is for a Fixed Rate of 0%, after a certain period of time it may change to a Variable Rate, generally calculated by adding some variable or fixed amount to the Prime Rate.    Fixed APR   A Fixed APR means that the APR is the same from month to month (our 0% APR example is a Fixed Rate). However, do not be deceived by the concept! A credit card company can change the interest rate, legally, at ANY time as long as they submit it to you in writing. If the credit company decides to do this, both new purchases and your outstanding balance is subjected to the change! More often than not, this happens if the bank that issued you your credit card is bought out by another bank. Always make sure you carefully read any addendums to your account.   Variable APR   A Variable APR is tied to general market interest rates (generally a Fixed interest rate plus the Prime Rate).   Default APR   Your Default APR is the interest rate you will incur if you make a late payment, overdraft funds, exceed your credit limit, piss off your customer service representative, or generally in any attempt to breach contract with your credit card. Simply put: make sure you always abide by the Terms of the initial Agreement and when written amendments come in the mail make sure you read them carefully! If you do not agree with New Terms, discontinue the card!   Prime Rate   A short-term interest rate designated by a commercial bank as an indication of the current rate being charged on loans to its best commercial customers.   APRs for Purchases, Balance Transfers and Cash Advances   Remember, generally speaking, a credit card will charge a different APR for purchases than it will for balance transfers and cash advances. Obviously, the only time to transfer a balance is when the interest rate will be lowered (factoring the cost of the balance transfer fee, if applicable). Cash advances are always going to incur a maximum fee and it is generally a bad idea to use your credit card as a means for a short-term loan. It is a far better idea to simply go to your bank and apply for a general loan.   Calculating Interest   Once you know the interest rate your credit card charges you, it is wise to consider the method in calculating said interest rate. There are two primary ways of doing this: 1) using the average daily balance method and 2) using the two-cycle average daily balance method, including new purchases.   Average Daily Balance Method   This is the fairest way of calculating interest. Basically, if you make a purchase and only pay part of it off when your statement comes in, you will only be charged on the remaining balance. For example, if you buy a stereo system for $800 and pay $500 of it off when you receive your statement, you are only charged interest on the remaining $300.   Two-cycle Average Daily Balance Method, including new purchases   This method calculates interest by taking the average of two billing cycles instead of one. So, let's take the previous example. Your next statement would reflect interest charges on almost the entire $800 balance. Calculating this becomes very complicated and would require dividing your Annual Percentage Rate by 365 in order to determine your daily interest rate. Then you would have to take your outstanding balance for both cycles and multiply those charges by the daily interest rate to determine how much interest would be accrued. Personally, I never go with a card which uses this method, as it seems unfair to the consumer unless the balance is paid in full every month (assuming an adequate Grace Period is allowed).    Grace Period   Your Grace Period is the amount of time between the closing of the bill cycle and the date you must pay your balance in full, so as not to accrue interest on said balance. This only applies, however, if you do not already carry an outstanding balance. Remember, once you carry an outstanding balance on your credit card, you will be charged interest immediately.    Fees, fees and more fees!   No matter what card you choose, there will always be certain fees which go right along with it. There may be fees associated with opening and closing the account, fees for balance transfers and cash advances, fees for exceeding account regulations such as making a late payment or exceeding your credit limit. There may be an overdraft fee. Fees for using the card may also be charged.    Application and/or Processing Fee   This will generally only be applicable if the person applying has a poor credit rating, however, it is a good idea to always ask upon applying for your credit card whether or not you will be incurred an application and/or processing fee.    Termination Fee   I've never actually come across such a fee, however, I always ask the bank to whom I'm applying in order to ensure that there is not a termination fee, if I choose to close my account. If I ever come across such a fee, I will promptly deny the issuer my service.    Balance Transfer Fees   As I mentioned in the beginning, balance transfer fees generally range from nothing--Citibank never charges a balance transfer fee--to $29, to $35, to $50 max. These may only be introductory offers, however, so if you plan to make a transfer after you've had your account open for some time, I would check and see if the fee has changed. Moreover, it is always a good idea to call the bank itself and ask what sort of offers are available for balance transfers.    Cash Advance Fees   Cash advances are never a good idea, not only because the interest rate is so high, as I said above, but also because sometimes there can even be a fee associated with them.    Late Payment, Exceeding Credit Line, and Overdraft Fees   These fees are very simply to avoid. Always make sure you make your payments on time--I pay my bill as soon as I get it, and I pay online to ensure it will get there in three days or so. I also take a screenshot of the payment receipt and confirmation number and save it to my hardrive. Also, make sure you know how much you're spending on your credit card. Not only is it embarrassing when your credit card comes back declined, but it can be detrimental to your account status. Similar to exceeding the credit limit on your credit card, don't exceed funds in your checking account to which you pay your credit card each month. Not only will you incur a fee at your bank or credit union, but also a fee with your credit card. Also, remember that not only do these fees occur when you don't pay attention, but your account can completely change and you might find yourself paying an exceptionally high interest rate because of a mistake that might have been avoided.    Annual Fee   Finally, there may be a fee associated with simply using the credit card. If a credit card charges an annual fee I will not open an account.    Important Questions to Ask When Applying for a Credit Card:       I've gathered some basic questions to ask from  urlLink Bankrate.com  and am publishing them here for your convenience.    Is there an introductory rate, what is it and how long does it last? After that, what will my rate be?    Is there an application fee?   Are there processing fees?   Is there an annual fee?   Is there a late fee?   Is there an over-the-limit fee?   Are there any other fees, like account termination fees or balance transfer fees?   When and how can a variable rate be changed?   When and how can a fixed rate be changed?   What is the grace period before interest is applied?   How will you inform me of any changes in my contract?   Will the company inform me if I am about to go over my limit?   If I go over my limit, what happens?   What is the company policy if I have trouble paying my bill?     Amuse Yourself!   If you get a credit card offer you feel is unsatisfactory, or you get any sort of unwarranted solicitation or advertisement where a convenience return envelope is enclosed (one of those envelopes which states "No postage necessary if mailed in the United States"), feel free to send it in the mail, along with the unwanted junk they sent you. I prefer to also add to any credit card offer which simply won't suit my needs--and generally no one else's either--a statement in large, bold letters; something to the nature of: "Denied Due to Insufficiency of Offer." I've been thinking of getting a stamp made. Oh what fun it is!

       This is for all of you interested in famed phsycist Stephen Hawking. Hawking recently delivered a speech (well, that is using the term 'speech' in an expressive sense, rather than a literal sense *wink*) to roughly 800 physicists, outlining the paradox of blackholes. For almost three decades, Hawking has been concerned with whether or not black holes really consumed and destroyed everything which entered them. He even went so far as to place a bet with a fellow colleague that they did in fact do so. However, today he publically announced that he had been wrong about the idea, that black holes do not in fact consume and destry everything which enters, but instead, will eventually spit all that enters in a "mangled" form.    The paradox involves subatomic theory that matter cannot be created nor destroyed. In essence then, matter can merely be transformed. Interestingly enough, Hawking has just further proved this theory to be true. Unfortunately, for science fiction buffs, however, it seems that less credibility will be given to films like The Black Hole and the like which show the mysteriousness of black holes and conclude they must lead to other universes. :)     urlLink More at MSN.com    urlLink An interesting BBC Q&amp;A session on what black holes are   And of course, what story on Stephen would be complete without a link to the hip, groovy and [H]ardcore antics of the M.C. himself?

      Hermann Hesse was born this day, 1877, and to celebrate his birthday, I'll post what I wrote after reading Journey to the East and Knulp, respectively.      Journey to the East      "Where are we really going?  Always home!" -- Novalis   Hermann Hesse's synthesis of characters real and fictional, a League of artists if you will.  Their goals remain individual in theory, but ultimately remain for the group--the whole.  The League creates a paradigm of spirituality: artistic and beautiful.  The tale surpasses that of any novel concerned primarily with a metamorphosis of sorts--a becoming.  Instead, it relies on the amalgam of Eastern and Western thought: Eastern philosophy--the One, the culmination of all things--and Western methodology--that of art and Platonic idealism, literature and early twentieth century Europeanism.    We follow H.H. in his travels with the League.  His personal goal is irrelevant, as irrelevant as the troupe who found their Bible to be the adventures of Don Quixote, or the scholars who sought Arabian magic, or the men who wished to plant strange trees in Holy lands.  What is relevant is the goal of the League as a whole; said best by H.H himself: "For our goal was not only the East, or rather the East was not only a country and something geographical, but it was the home and youth of the soul, it was everywhere and nowhere, it was the union of all times."º  And what better way to acknowledge this home of the soul than to understand and practice the philosophy of the servant Leo: "the Law of service.  He who wishes to live long must serve, but he who wishes to rule does not live long" (Hesse, 34).  This, the philosophy of Jesus, the remarkable concept that a man thrust into existence can never understand, and the miserablism of the ubermensch will never attain.  The skeptics who did not understand the importance of faith: of attaining something higher than reason, called the movement such names as "the Children's Crusade"ºº to show that it was not to be taken seriously.  But in order to sustain, the League must perpetuate its first principle, and: "...never to rely on and let [itself] be disconcerted by reason, always to know that faith is stronger than so-called reality" (Hesse, 54).  These skeptics are all the men of despair: they have refused to live the faithful life of a servant, humbling themeselves to greatness and nobility.  They have become something dreadful--they have not awakened.    And I realize I have not awakened.  And my problem is that of H.H.: uncertainty.    "Despair is the result of each earnest attempt to go through life with virtue, justice and understanding and to fulfill their requirements.  Children live on one side of despair, the awakened on the other side." -- The Servant Leo (Hesse, 111)    [ urlLink Read it yourself  | painting, "Journey to the East" by Ronnie Landfield, 1994.  I am, however, not positive its inspiration, but it seemed appropriate. ]  End Notes:    ºHermann Hesse,  The Journey to the East , trans. Hilda Rosner (New York, NY: Bantam Books, 1972), 27.    ººIt should be noted that Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. writes a book entitled  Slaughterhouse-Five: Or The Children's Crusade  some thirteen years later.  More on that in a future post.   Knulp     As I perused a few of Hermann Hesse's watercolors (he did something like 3,500 watercolors!), searching for something that I felt Knulp would have seen, I began to reflect on the story I cherish so dearly.  I've read it before, but before I read it with blind eyes.  It was simply a tale of wandering--a man who died young, but died happy, amidst his final recollection of his past.  I found him to be like Job when God proposed to him life and death, covenant and waywardness.  I found it ironic that Knulp was a wanderer, much like the Wild Ass which roams the countryside full of hedonistic rage and folly.  I found solace in the notion that a homeless tramp would be endearing to God.  Did he suffer as Job did?  Did his faithful nature save him?  It seems that Knulp did roam the countryside, but he did so as a glimmer of hope: he provided that idea that all men strive for.  The carefree tune a musician finds in sweet harmony; the wayward flower which blossoms amidst a gloomy woodland; the man who projects the philosophy of good.  Amongst his reflections, Knulp considered places he'd been and women he'd swooned; people he'd affected and joyfulness he projected.  As a philosopher he was never dogmatic; he only spoke of the ideal: the good--and insofar as one might stride another path, Knulp would prove a guide in spirit--perhaps simply with a whistle, or a crudely written poem--but he would always allow the man to walk on his own.  And now I think he was a man of God: as he mentioned the sitting of Christ with the innocent, young children, where he complimented them on their humbled nature.  Or perhaps it was his goodly nature not to give into bestial lusts--an honest man, wavering no principle for temporal pleasure.  And what of his reflections on pleasure?  His understanding of beauty?  He spoke of all things beautiful as those that leave us with a feeling of "sadness and fear" for all things good must surely perish--all things beautiful must decay.  This Socratic understanding of love that it is a (lover) longing for something (the beloved)--and once attained, is no longer loved.  The lover is endlessly searching for its beloved, as Aristophanes projected (perhaps not for the right reasons) in his tale of the one half, searching for the other--his origin of man.  Much the same, Knulp sees that all good things die--and that all good things are good things isolated from other things: they have their own souls, and each soul is new.  For what would be pleasurable of a thing that remains beautiful always and never dies?--and a thing much like the rest?  One would grow tired of it.  And as I reflect, I see it a sad truth that love is something that is forever unattainable, that glimmer in the sky one finds only in his peripheral vision, that exotic flower atop a mountain never trekked by man, that simple philosophical truth which binds us all together.  Knulp's simple answer to the complex problem of The Good is as follows: that man feels happy when good deeds are done, and guilty when bad deeds are done.  His attitude is pure and innocent--his existence permeates with joy.  What does it matter that psychology defines sociopaths as finding good in bad things?  Perhaps it is as simple as Knulp states, much the same as Socrates reflects when he continually perpetuates this idea that all things go to The Good--that some are merely misguided.  Knulp's passion for living--and living for good--justifies his folly, his waywardness, his wandering.  A traveler is only shallow if he does not reflect on his travels.  Hesse painted his reflections--in this one I see Knulp on the edge of his hometown--while Knulp reveled with God in his.  Thank you Hermann Hesse, for providing me and so many others so much inspiration.  Buy Hermann Hesse books  urlLink here !

I find the short article interesting because it simply further proves that evolutionary theory is a good working model and is adequate in helping determine the history of life itself.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - The O'Reilly Factor - Ben Affleck Talks Politics   Yeah, it's been over a week since this interview, but I just had to throw this out...      "You know, I want to tell you something. I respect you. I didn't know you before tonight. You come in. You answer the questions. You're not bomb-throwing. You're not a hater. And all Americans should applaud you. You're 30 years old" -- Bill O'reilly   And a damn fine picture that is Ben!

       It occurred to me as I was searching for that crazy myth, the American Dream, that perhaps I’ve lost complete control.   Is it just me being some twisted mental case, or are we in deep shit—as it were?   Perhaps I’m babbling on and on but the idea that we elect into office some deep-pocketed anti-warmonger, who, on the other side wants to kick some serious global ass—is that a contradiction?—seems to disturb me somewhat.   Then again, the current oil drilling religious nutcase really doesn’t seem to be concerned with our best interests either.   Let’s take the country back, they both say.   Let’s kick some ass.   Yeah.   What are we to do with this?  Kerry’s lost some brownies after that spectacle of fireworks and balloons and divided promises no one in their right mind could ever swear oath to provide.   Yet, Bush’s inarticulate nature and mangled version of foreign policy frightens me even more to the very core of my being.   Maybe we deserve it all after all.   Either way, I think I’ll be the first to wear my helmet outside.   Those bastards will never get me—I’m protected.  Is it we who put these slackers in Washington?   Goddamn, the bogeymen in our closets have all collected on Capitol Hill.   They’ve got us by the balls and there’s no turning back, I think.   But now I’m digressing.     Are we really crazy enough to challenge the counter-nations among us?   And if so, do we have the right?   Or have the mean-spirited angst ridden ethics of the sixties completely lost on this degenerate generation?   Have we lost all sensibility and pride and patriotism?   Oh fuckit, let’s just be escapist pigs and campaign against the war and spend our times beating each other to bloody pulps because of it.   That’s the solution—I think.   Make us the butt of our own jokes yet again.   Repeat.  Should we lose sleep over all of this crazy shit?   Or should we—as it were—abandon our capitalist posts and drive ourselves into battle with our H2s to save the oil?   Perhaps if we were all Generals or something—then things would get done I think.   All leaders and no foot soldiers: that’s war in 2004.   We could spend all of our time critiquing the battleground, and less time getting killed.   Of course, then the bastards might take us all.     These maggots we worship in non-partisan houses, secretly overriding their outspoken speeches with esoteric truths so vulgar and obscene, as it would really probably be better that We the People not know of them.   This is the same lonely trip Kesey took in his early years at Stanford.   Or maybe not—I’m not really so sure.   But again, I’m digressing.  Let’s focus, if only for a second, on the real issue here.   Is there an issue?   Could we all simply go on about our daily lives, working and sleeping and fucking and so on?   I think so—I have no kids, so I can’t be to blame.   But I’ll stay involved anyway.   Yeah, Rock the Vote, as it were.   That’s what they say anyway.   So remember to vote kids and vote often.
