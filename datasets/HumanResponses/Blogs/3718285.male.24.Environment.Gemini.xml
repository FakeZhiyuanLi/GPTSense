      So at the end of the weekend, the damage to my friends and I is   1 Night in Jail 1 Car accident 1 Flat Tire   All in all, it was interesting.  My girlfriend, by the way, just got back from a hiking trip in the John Muir Wilderness.  She took some gorgeous pictures, which I'll post when I get a chance.

      Hello all.  This particular entry is about my night last evening.  I played beirut with my friends for a few hours at home and then went out for drinks.  All was fine and good.  We went to Mauna Loa on fillmore and then headed over to Bar None, on Union.  If anyone needs to know about Bar None, its a lot like a frat party.  On my way out I had a beer in my hand.  When I stepped out with it the bouncers piled on top of me and beat me up.  I ended up handcuffed on the ground by some pricks who weren't cops.  Fortunately my buddy had called the police.  My parents also managed to make it (mom is a lawyer) and that seemed to calm things down.  I ended up beaten and bruised in the drunk tank, because these pricks decided they wanted to beat someone up.  By the way, going to jail for the night sucks.  Try to avoid it.  The positive is that in San Francisco you get released in four hours without anything on your record for your troubles.

      In case you didn't know, Reno is growing at a massive rate.  I was there yesterday, and there is a huge amount of construction.  Thousands of people are moving there from California every month.  The rises in home prices are phenomenal.  Prices have doubled over the past few years, which is phenomenal. I am always amazed by it.    In my life, however, I still need to figure out where I am going to live in Davis.  I've been looking at mobile homes, apartments, and other options.  All that I'm sure of is that I don't want to live with other people.  I've had roommates for six years and I don't want one now.  I'm just tired of it.  I really need my own space to do my own thing.

                         st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                        I just got off the phone with a friend in   Minden ,  Nevada  .&nbsp; Its always amazing what jerks people can be, especially when they are in elected office.&nbsp; I guess the difference is elected officials can do so much more damage.           &nbsp;          &nbsp;

      As this is the first posting to this blog, I figured a brief description of things might be in order.  I am in the process of quitting my job, which I will not go into more than to say I am grateful.  I'm currently enrolled at the  urlLink UC Davis Graduate School of Management  for the fall quarter of this year, which I am a little worried about.  I still need to find somewhere to live and figure out how I'm going to survive biz school.  The blog title, by the way has nothing to do with this.  I'm planning to travel a little with my girlfriend this summer, and thats about it.    At the moment, I'm 24. I live in San Francisco.  I like to fish, ski, bike, and spend time outdoors.  I live in an apartment with five people including my girlfriend.  I'm white, I went to Middlebury College in Vermont.  I grew up in San Francisco.  I work for a non profit environmental organization.  I drive an Infiniti G20.  I have a little sister who is a student at UVM.  My desk is a mess.  My life seems to be on track.

      So I'me headed back to Minneapolis today to visit family.  My parents are also on their way, but they are flying themselves.  When I get back, I have to drive to Sacramento on Monday to pick up the dog who is being baby sat by my dads best friend.      On the way back I actually get keys to my apartment in Davis.  I'm excited about that.  I still won't have furniture, water, or electricity but you have to start somewhere.  That will all get resolved.  I'm also thinking about getting a cat when I get myself settled.

      Sorry about the delay.  I was out with friends in the Sacramento valley two weekends ago getting truly wasted and this past weekend my girlfriends family was in town.  We went to Sonoma and spent a few days there.  The Wine Country is really nice, especially if you don't already live in Northern California.  Work has also been a bear.  I'm considering purchasing a computer.  In particular,  I think I'm going to get the Alienware Sentia because of the support and the upgrade policy.
