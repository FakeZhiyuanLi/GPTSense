						   Horse vans have been arriving from the BR breeding farm with the next crop of young horses ready to begin training.  Below are just a few of the horses that have caught my eye on their first couple of works.  Probably the most exciting horse at this time is the three year old colt  Marathon Man .  While not fully recovered from his journey to the track, he clocked his first work at :38 1/5 and promptly clocked in at :36 1/5 on his second run of the day.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do once fully rested.   The Great Pretender  is another three year old colt that worked well upon his arrival to the track posting times of :39 1/5 and :37 3/5.  While the boys had my immediate attention, one grey filly was not about to be shown up.   Double Martini  demanded my attention when she arrived to the track and put up times of :39 2/5 and :37.  Other horses that we will be carefully reviewing once they reach top condition and stamina are:  Steamboat Captain - :39 1/5 and :37 2/5 Russian Roulette - :38 2/5 and :37 3/5 Vincent - :40 2/5 and :37 4/5 Heartbreak Hotel - :39 4/5 and :38 1/5 Late for Dinner - :39 3/5 and :38 1/5 Belledonna -  :40 1/5 and :38 3/5

						   After reviewing the new crop of horses from the farm, the following horses have been selected to represent Barefoot Racing in my first attempt at regular racing at a high class track.   Angel Skies   Nice 4 yr old filly that turned in an impressive time for her first race. I've currently returned her to 3 furlong works to reassess her adds.   Black Bahram   Purchased under some ridcule in the first auction, this young colt will surely be the cause of my premature balding.  Proving to be capable of running 5f at 1:00, I'm struggling with getting him to maintain consistency in his workouts.  He is at Del Mar for works comparisons and adds reassessing but unless I can gain confidence in his consistency, he won't see racing until late this year.   Call me Ishmael   Claimed from Mojo Stables for 20.00, this 3 yr old colt is under adds reassessment.  If work out times and rankings continue to hold well, I'll give me a shot.   Chardonnay   Interesting 2 yr old filly who is on her first add test.  Still much to be determined here.   Double Martini   I'm really enjoying this 2 yr old filly.  She runs consistent with or without blinks, but a recent try with the Shadow roll had her balking all during her last work.   Foxfire   A quiet 2 yr old colt that I am still undecided on.  Very consistent in his works compared to some of my other two year olds.  I'll gain a better feel for him when I stretch him to 4 furlongs.   Glencaraig Lady   Claimed from Barking Stables, this girl is one of my favorites.  Tons of heart!  While she only finished fourth in her last race, she was forced 7 wide to make a 2 length gain on the leader in the last furlong.  I'd like to see what she does when she gets a clear shot at the wire.   Heartbreak Hotel   Promising 3yr old colt that has me eager to finish out the adds testing and get him racing.   Indiana Wants Me   Extremely consistent in his works (until you through a shadow roll on him), I expect this 3 yr old colt to be an honest runner against others.   Marathon Man   Has been struggling a bit under his adds testing with his best work coming with no adds.  Time will tell on this 3yr old colt.   Marilyn Monroe   Claimed from Grendal Ranch, she is my favorite of the older mares.  She successfully went out to win for me her first race after claiming.  I'll be shortineing her distance in upcoming races and running some adds reassessments.   Overnight Express   Runs :35's without adds and has yet to be tested with a jockey.  This 2 yr old colt has me pretty happy with his works far.  It'll be interesting to see if he can hold on to his times as I increase distance.   Russian Roulette   This big grey 3 yr old colt has quickly won me over.  Pulling a 1/35 bullet followed immediatly by a 1/10 bullet, his 34.4 followed by two 35 and change's makes me wonder how well he'll do under a jockey.  Look for this guy in a Maiden soon.   Steamboat Captain    This 2 yr old colt responded to early training and has earned his way to the DMR squad.  He still has some adds testing and may not be raced until later in the year.   The Great Pretender   Another one who is struggling under adds testing.  Dont be surprised if he comes into his Maiden with no adds.   Wardance   This black 3 yr old colt stacks up well with his grey stable mate Russian Roulette, although not as consistent in his works.  He has acheived a 34.4 as well, but I'm still working on the add combinations to see what might bring him some consistency.   All in all, I'm pretty please with this crew so far.  However most of these horses have yet to be tested beyond 3 furlongs and that will make a big difference as to whether or not they will actually see a race entry at Del Mar.  Good luck to all!
