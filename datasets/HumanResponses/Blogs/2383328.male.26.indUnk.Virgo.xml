      Soundtrack: "Gospodi Vozzvakh Tebe" "Lord I have cried unto Thee", Vespers verses in Tone 8, Galician Chant, sung by the choir of St Elias Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, Brampton, Ontario.   A priest said that the invention of the refrigerator may have had an negative impact on Christian charity - in the days when food could not keep, we would more likely have thougth to give leftovers away to those who had no food. These days we just plonk it back into the fridge for the next day.   An interesting thought.

      Soundtrack: "Air pour Les Sauvages" from Jean-Philippe Rameau's opera Les Indes Galantes, played by the Orchestra of the 18th Century,dir. Frans BrÃ¼ggen. Meant as a bit of music for a dance of the "savages" in Rameau's early 1700s opera, this tune became quite popular in French Louisiana, and apparently was the only bit of white music that caught on with the natives, and they played it in their own gatherings and danced to it. Rameau apparently was immensely pleased when he heard of it.   Ok, so the singers for the concert aren't quite up to scratch, so we've decided to drop the chorus from the concert. That's a weight off my mind really, I've been stressing myself out these past few weeks trying to locate singers at short notice, not to mention teaching people their parts. I've not been doing anything other than music these past few days, not good. Dom's girlfriend Linda taught me some yoga relaxation exercises, may help my back and arm problems.   I think I'll spend Sunday away from all work on music - I won't even answer music-related telephone calls. I need some rest and relaxation. I think I'll go have my feet massaged. Ah, the very thought of it fills my mind with joy.   Spent the evening at Prof's place, rehearsing more music for the concert - just with him, the harpsichord girl and the Japanese chap who plays Viola da Gamba. Lovely music making, and normally I'd have been very happy to do it, but having to call and lead a rehearsal at this particular point in time was the last thing I needed to do.   Thank goodness Glen called me at about ten and asked me out for a film. He picked me up and we watched Le Papillon, a charming French film. A perfect end to a really crummy day. Amazingly enough, as the film began, the three teenaged boys next to us (2 malays and a beng) saw the opening titles and went "ha, this film not Ingrish one ah?" Glen and I tried very hard not to laugh.   Think I'll soak my feet now.

      Soundtrack: "Bless the Lord O my soul", Russian Greek-chant harmonised by Katalsky, performed by the Ural Choir.   Hurrah, today's tenor was a joy to work with. Very rewarding, and of course, it helps he's cute.   Arm still smarts a little, but it doesn't hurt as bad as yesterday or this morning, so I think I may be able to rest in the arms of Morpheus without the usual alcoholic stupor.   Currently, one of my pet amusements is collecting examples of Singaporean stupidity and cultural illiteracy. In recent memory, two anecdotes stand out as shining examples.   Just the other day I walked past a motorcycle shop, and I heard a man saying "wah, Yamaha got make music instrument one ah?".   Then there was the twit who upon overhearing that we Orthodox put icons in our churches, light candles, kiss them, prostrate ourselves and pray before them... actually asked "so you all like kiss the Internet Explorer icon or what ah?"  Ye Gods, give me strength.

      Soundtrack: "Love U More" by Sunscream. Interesting... it doesn't sound like it came out in 1992. A fascinating track, it's of a genre I don't usually like but I can see why it makes good clubbing music.   Last night's attempt to teach one of the altos her part didn't go too well, she's a dear dear friend and I love her to bits, but she has so many problems pitching that I felt we had to let her go. I'm getting really stressed over this coming concert, perfectionist that I am. I know we'll be fine if we're one alto short, 7 is still workable, but I'd still really really like an octet. I get so worked up about these things, and I know I shouldn't.  Dominic, my music mentor of sorts, made me feel better when he thanked me for all the work I'm doing for the concert. He also introduced me to that song "Love U More", good stuff. I'm really quite grateful to Dom, who pushes me musically - otherwise I'd never improve. Got home last night really late, went straight to bed. Couldn't sleep, my right arm was in pain. Felt like the ligaments and tendons from the fingertips of the last three fingers stretching down to the elbow were on fire. Had a double Pernod to help me sleep.   Best of all, this morning I woke up with a ridiculous pain in my back and hip. The back pain, I suspect, is due to a bed that's too soft, even though the bed is harder than most. The hip pain, I know is due to that hunting injury I sustained 2 years ago in England when I fell off a horse at full gallop. My big brother Anthony today at lunch tells me the arm pain may be carpal tunnel syndrome. Not a pleasant thought, that.   Watched Talkingcock the Movie today. Quite quite funny.  Going out to teach a tenor his part this evening. Gods help us, I'll scream if this one's as tone-deaf as the alto last night.

      Soundtrack: "Chunari Chunari", a great bit of hindi pop from the film Monsoon Wedding.   One learns something new everyday, often several new things everyday. "Influenza" is actually derived from a Venetian term "La Influenza di Stelle", or "the influence of the stars". Next, "Malaria" is derived from the Italian "Mal'aria" or "bad air", from the old belief that it was caused by the bad air of the marshes.   Was at rehearsal last night. Stuff for the December concerts is coming along nicely. Again I have to recommend The Piano Tuner by Daniel Mason, a brilliant piece of writing.  Currently, I'm working on the Basso Continuo part of a movement from a Vivaldi violin concerto (from L'estro Armonico)... and reading Kings of Albion by Julian Rathbone.

      Soundtrack: "Tattoo It On Me" by Paul Lekakis.  I can't help it. I'm a pedant. Here I am, listening to one of the few 1980s pop stars whose work I actually know - Paul Lekakis, and getting annoyed by his lyrics. Not by the inaneness that marks pop lyrics, but by a line in his "Tattoo it on me" which goes "... while the temperature rises up".  Surely "rises up" is an oxymoron? I know I ought not be bothered by it, but every single time I hear the line, I cringe.   Just as when I hear someone go "horse-riding". "Riding" is, by default, on a horse. Only when riding other things/animals does one specify what is being ridden. Even worse is when someone says "horseback-riding". What other part of the horse is there to ride? I have yet to hear of anyone riding the head of a horse.

      Show's opening tonight - Rashomon. Based on Kurosawa's  urlLink film , it tells various conflicting accounts of what happened in a rape and murder set in late 11th or 12th Century Japan, in the Late Heian period. Want some analyses of it?  urlLink Here  and  urlLink here .  The play's being staged by ACSian Theatre - the drama club of Anglo-Chinese Junior College, my old sixth-form college. What do I do there? I used to coach them for drama but this time I'm a musician, providing about ten minutes of flute music before the show, in order to set the mood. It's just a flute and drum, and I'm improvising in the style of Japanese Court Music. If anyone who attends the production thinks what I'm playing sounds absolutely horrid, tuneless, dissonant and out of tune, you're absolutely right. That's how Japanese court music sounds. In fact, what I'm playing is already a more tonal and tuneful version - I can perceive neither tonality nor melody in the original  urlLink stuff .    When I first read accounts of the western missionaries having to sit through endless hours of Japanese court music and complaining that they'd not heard anything so horrible in their lives, I thought they were just ignorant westerners who couldn't appreciate the beauty of Asian things, even though they said they wished they were back in Cathay (China) where the music was tuneful and entertaining. Then I heard Gagaku, and I realised they were right. Coming from an environment with Vivaldi and Handel, being forced to endure hours of this must have been truly torture. Pity that so much skill (these musicians were trained for years) should be spent to produce such a hideous result. There is, however, one undoubted advantage in Japanese Court Music. There are people who can hear no melody in Chinese Classical Music. Such a person should attend a concert of Gagaku, with all the traditional instruments and dances , and then attend one of Chinese music the next night. If, after their horrid wailing, he can still find no melody in our Chinese dances and songs, he must give up looking for a tune in anything. If you're still game, have a look at these sites, which explain Gagaku -  urlLink here and  urlLink here .   Just so you know, a traditional Noh orchestra consists of a flute (noh-kan) and 3 drums. We're working with one clay drum (a small doumbek from egypt), and I'm playing two flutes - one is a renaissance flute in D, made of maple wood, and a smaller chinese bamboo flute.   Apparently, Japanese Court Music is supposed to be a descendant of T'ang Chinese Court Music, and an immediate descent of ancient Hokkien Music from the Fukien province of China. I find it hard to believe the Chinese could have ever had such hair-raisingly awful music, and that when the Japanese in the 9th Century were aping Chinese culture, they tried to imitate the Chinese stuff and didn't quite get it right. There's no other explanation for it.   urlLink  Let Taxi Drivers Run The World!   In other news, since I suspect none of you read my online buddy Serge's  urlLink blog , I'm reproducing his entry of 28 Jan, which is quite worth reading.  ----------- Wednesday, January 28, 2004     From  urlLink bubdaddy   urlLink  This is war   Video clip - in negative black and white but very disturbing.  Commentary: This is a graphic depiction of the killing produced by warfare. The people who are shown being shot appear to be unaware that an Apache attack helicopter armed with a high-speed 30mm cannon is firing explosive rounds at them. When they are hit, they disappear.........presumably blown to bits. The clip first aired on ABC news in a show which questioned the "morality" of shooting the wounded man trying to crawl to the "safety" of the road side.  It takes about a minute (with cable modem) to download the clip.  It is EXTREMELY GRAPHIC.  ...I don't celebrate killing anyone, but think that it's important to see. If those being shot had the Apache helicopter, I'm certain that we would be seeing Americans being turned into chunks. I AM disturbed that they shot the wounded man, but it it is conceivable that he was crawling toward an anti-aircraft missile or RPG.   urlLink Mission to Mars  Spot on. I'd thought of sending him there myself but that'd only mask/treat a symptom, not face the problem (after all, he's only a sock puppet). Still, very funny. -----  Serge also runs  urlLink A Conservative Site for Peace , under which his  urlLink religion page  is also well worth visiting.

      Too busy to write something on my own today, but here's a little something from my Spiritual Father, Fr Serge Keleher of Dublin:   My mother swore that a friend of hers who liked to knit once copied some Chinese ideographs from a menu - she didn't know what they said, but they looked pretty - and incorporated them into the design of a sweater which she proceeded to knit for herself. The first literate Chinese she ran into while wearing the sweater nearly dropped dead from laughter - the sweater announced that "this dish is cheap but delicious"!

       Not Quite the Wisdom of the Fathers   "If you can't remember where you left your keys, what page numbers you needed to read for tomorrow's class, or whether you left the stove on....just go do your prayer rule.  I guarantee you'll remember it all and much more besides. Worrying about tomorrow's schedule while trying to pray yields even more spectacular memory recovery results."  -- quoted from "Hidden Benefits of an Orthodox Neophyte Prayer Life" by  urlLink Karl Thienes  (who isn't likely to achieve unceasing prayer let alone 20 consecutive minutes of focused prayer without the grace of God and bloody miracle!)

      Have a look at this:  urlLink Children Upset By Pheasant Shooting     "There's nothing wrong with hunting as long as you eat and/or otherwise use what you kill. The hypocrisy of modernity also strikes me - time was in America when many 12-year-old boys had small hunting rifles and wouldn't think of hurting another person with them. Now they and their parents play violent video games simulating multiple cold-blooded murders (scary sight I've seen: a 9-year-old playing a computer game realistic and graphic enough to train soldiers and cops), and chances are the same people react as described to children seeing the reality behind eating meat."   - Link and comment from my friend's blog - Serge, otherwise known as the Young Fogey at  urlLink A Conservative Blog for Peace

      Where do I stand politically?   Variously. Have a look at  urlLink Lewrockwell.com  and the  urlLink Spectator  and you'll get an idea.   I'm in favour of tolerance. In that sense I'm a liberal - I believe in letting a gazillion flowers bloom, and only plucking out weeds such as communists, anarchists...  I support foxhunting and hunting in general. Cityfolk ought not attempt to interfere in the lives of countryfolk, lives that they neither understand nor care to.   I'm anti-war in all cases.   Bush is a monkey with very little brain, and Blair is just as bad.  I'm a monarchist.   I don't believe in legislation treats people of different sexual orientation unfairly. On the other hand, I believe that legislation must not deprive us of our rights of free association - we have the right not to have beliefs we don't accept forced down our throats. I.E. I'm all in favour of some sort of civil legislation allowing homosexual unions, so that certain legal rights of inheritance and suchlike may be extended to the partner. On the other hand, if anyone tries to force my Church to have priestesses or give gay unions a blessing, I'll be among the first to be martyred in her defence.   I'm elitist - I believe in maintaining standards of decorum, language, intellectual rigour and dress. I'm a young fogey. What's that? Look  urlLink here .   I believe men and women are equal but different, and it's silly to pretend the two genders are good at the same things.   I have the mind of a Mediaeval man - I believe God intervenes actively in creation, hence I believe in miracles, relics, visions and suchlike. And yet I live firmly in the current century. Give or take 500 years. Ok, more like take 500 years... but who's counting?  I don't believe in the equality of cultures. Ebonics does not have equal footing with Shakespeare. The "cultures" of sub-saharan Africa have produced no important literature, music or contributions to the world - I refuse to place these various Bongo-bongoland savages on par with India, Greece, Rome and China.   Ok, off my soapbox for now.

      Soundtrack: Ana Caram singing "The Girl from Ipanema".  People wonder why I'm such a fan of  urlLink The Spectator  -  urlLink here's an article  that I agree entirely with. Read the Spectator, read it often. A journal whose sole criterion for article inclusion is elegance of expression cannot be anything other than a pleasure to read. The Spectator is unashamedly elitist, and so am I. Someone's got to keep the standards up.

      Spent today lazing at home, watched live Divine Liturgy (that's what we Orthodox call the usual church service) broadcast from Moscow. Cheryl Ho called me out, so we hung out at Liat Towers Starbucks, watching the world go by. Jared Kok was there. He's a prime example of "i'm trying so hard to be cool that it's painful to watch me" syndrome. With his bit of black cord twisted around fingers and hand, with a silver cross dangling from little finger... then i asked him "Officer yet or not" he went "not yet... wed!" and did a little "heels-together and fingers touch shoulder then salute" sort of thing. I swear, I so wanted to say "beam me up, scotty!" I won't even mention how his voice has dropped two octaves into the attempted sub-bass region, and how he claims it's due to his smoking.   I want to watch Bollywood Queen. Meanwhile, here are some Indian-inspired links!  Ever heard of  urlLink Indian Superman ? Have a look at that page, it sounds hilarious.   TEN CHINS NO MORE!   Don't be deceived by the pretty pink cover of the Bollywood Workout - this is high impact! If you've ever tried to imitate Shah Rukh Khan sexy moves, this is the ultimate exercise video for you. Utilising a combination of Bollywood and Bhangra style dance moves and aerobics, the instructor Honey Kalaria (an expert Indian Dance choreographer) guides the viewer through a range of typical dance movements, with plenty of arm waving, hip and bum thrusting. The music is strongly East-West, in Hindi and English, and the sight of women in the video dancing slightly out of step and sweating is strangely comforting. One even had a roll of flesh around her waist - yippee! Now you have an excuse the next time you're caught dancing along to Aishwarya Rai's routine . Available in PAL VHS  (£12.99) or DVD (£14.99) from  urlLink Amazon.com  - coconut trees and saree changes not included.   I've been asked why I don't put my favourite recipes up. It's simple - they're my secrets, and a magician never reveals his secrets! But seriously, it's best to just watch me do them in person, because I'm one of those people who never follow recipes exactly, and I don't use exact measures. I work with quantities such as "meat for 6", "a dash of this", "a pinch of that", "a handful of googbley-gook", and thus there's not much point. If you guys want me to list recipes that have just a list of ingredients in vague amounts and directions, okay... just let me know!

      Was at a wedding earlier this evening. A lesbian 'commitment ceremony' to be precise, in a home. It was sweet, I've known one of the brides since I was 17, in Junior College. At the end, they threw both bouquets... and I swear, one of them was aimed straight for my face. So I got it. That means I'm next in line for a lesbian wedding yes? :D  Zhi came back on monday, will see how he's settling in and when we can meet up.

      Alrighty, it's time for a book and film update.   I've just finished reading Alexander Solzhenitsyn's  urlLink Gulag Archipelago , all three volumes of it. Needless to say, I didn't read it in Russian - my resolve not to read works in translation weakened in this case. Arkhipelag Gulag, as it's called in the original Russian, is a compilation of experiences and anecdotes about the Soviet prison camps and the injustice and inhumanity of the Communist system. No one can read it and continue to think that Communism is not a creation of pure evil. It's very very depressing, but worthwhile reading. One of the most monumental accounts of one of the cruellest ideologies of history,this book should be read by all. Layer by layer Solzhenitsyn exposes the hideous system of imprisonment ,death and torture that he refers to as the 'Gulag Archipelago'. He strips away that the misconception of the good Tsar Lenin betrayed by his evil heirs and exposes how it was Lenin and his henchmen who put into place the brutal totalitarianism , which would be inherited and continued by Stalin. In fact the only thing that Stalin really did differently was to introduce a more personalised ,Imperial style of rule but otherwise carried on the evil work of Lenin. It was Lenin who imprisoned the Cadets (Constitutional Democrats) , Mensheviks,Social Democrats,Social Revolutionaries Anarchists and independent intelligentsia and had many killed. In this way he completely destroyed all opposition to Bolshevik hegemony. Under Lenin the persecution started of anybody convicted of religious activity and the complete destruction of the church in Russia. And it was Lenin who began the genocide of whole ethnic groups that would later gain momentum under Stalin. Under the Communist system all that is spiritual or not purely material in nature is destroyed.And we discover what a horror Marx's idea of 'dialectic materialism ' really is. But I cannot describe the horrors which Solzhenitsyn outlines in this book :the hideous tortures,the slave markets selling of young women into sexual slavery. Solzhenitsyn describes how the prison system of the Tsarist system was compassionate by comparison but the mild abuses of Tsarist imprisonment where reacted to with a shrill outcry that never greeted the horrors of Bolshevism and Communism. As he says in his ever present biting sarcasm "Its just not fashionable,just not fashionable." And even today,even after the fall of Communism in Europe (though its iron grip remains strong in parts of Asia,Africa and in Cuba) its still not regarded as fashionable to highlight the horrors of Communism as it is to do so for other human rights abuses of this and other centuries  A really silly film that's probably never going to make it to Singapore is  urlLink Bubba Ho-Tep . The premise is quite simple - Elvis didn't really die, he swapped places with an Elvis impersonator, and is now rotting away in a home for the elderly. Pair him up with a black guy who believes he's JFK and that aliens replaced his brain with a bag of sand. Add an Egyptian mummy who hides out in the home and terrorises the residents, turn our JFK and Elvis into heroes... and you've got Bubba Ho-Tep. It looks hilarious, I'd love to see it on the big screen, but I'm not hopeful.   Another one that's looking good is  urlLink The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra , which seems to be a parody of all those B-grade horror films. Watch the  urlLink trailer , it's a scream.   Finally, there's Mel Gibson's  urlLink The Passion of the Christ  - about the last 24 hours of Christ's life. Filmed entirely in the original languages (or so Gibson thinks- more about this later) of Latin and Greek and completely faithful to the Gospel accounts, it should be quite interesting. My only gripe with the film is the languages used - Pilate speaks Latin, instead of Greek, which was the language of administration and common intercourse in the Eastern parts of the Roman Empire. Worse still, he pronounces his Latin in the horrible 18th Century Italian pronunciation, instead of any of the historical pronunciations. I can't comment on the Syriac which the Jewish characters speaks, because I don't know much Syriac. The film's going to be very very bloody - have a look at the  urlLink trailer  (from an unofficial site). Nevertheless, it's a good effort, and I'm glad he's decided to be faithful to the Gospels, including the crowd of Jews shouting "His Blood be upon us and our children". I think the Jews who protest the film should just get over it - it happened.

      The prize for cheesiest Chinese New Year song must go to the new one which uses the melody from Jingle Bells, and replaces them with mandarin words. I'm not kidding. Try singing it: "Gongxi ni, gongxi ni, gongxi gongxi niiiiiiii"  I was in shock for about 10 seconds when I first heard it. Half my brain was telling "oh it's a Christmas song" and the other half "it's Mandarin, it's clearly going Gongxi ni". Took me a while before both sides compared notes and I realised what was going on.   Now, the Chinese have created so many beautiful and exquisitely tasteful things in history... why is it that when it comes to Chinese New Year, all that good taste goes straight down the drain in favour of complete in-your-face crassness? The communist period didn't help either, I suspect. Jan Wong's book " urlLink Red China Blues " mentions how the Finnish Embassy in Peking would keep all the hideous official gifts in a special room, dubbed "the chamber of horrors". In case you're wondering, it's a great read.

      I swear, if I hear any more "Tong Tong Tong Chiang", I'm going to scream. No wonder suicide rates go up around this time of the year, it's the annoying Chinese New Year music. I'm convinced the constant barrage of questions - "do you have a girlfriend yet? When are you getting married?" - also contribute to it.   Was in the MRT (the Singapore equivalent of the Tube) the other day, and there was that horrible piped music "tong tong tong chiang". As if that weren't bad enough, some Ah-Lian (the Singapore equivalent of an Essex Girl) took out her mobile phone and played her ringtone (also "tong tong tong chiang") in time to the music. Obviously she felt it was the height of coolness. I was practically clawing at the doors and screaming "LET ME OUT!!!"  Woke up at quarter to 11 today, and nearly screamed the house down, realising I'd be late for my 11 coffee-breakfast appointment. Got there at half-past 11 and then Yen called and said he'd be late, finally arriving about 12. Oh, gay boys. It turned out a wonderful day to be sitting at Liat Towers, watching the crowds go by. The crowds, of course, included many extremely fine examples of the "cute jock" type to which Yen and I are both so fond. These included several ruggers, swimmers and waterpolo players, who all came by to say hi upon noticing me. Ah, yes, it's good to be a venerable old Buddha into whose temple all and sundry feel obliged to enter and burn incense to upon passing.   Kerr-Chinh came by at 1 and joined us for lunch (el cheapo from Burger King). Kerr-Chinh I've not seen in some 5 years, since we were both in the same camp back in NS. He's quite a character too, having known me since ACS and ACJC, but we never really hung out. I hadn't realised it was his gang who started the Sailing Club in ACJC, having graduated from ACS and finding no such activity in ACJC. KC quite kindly bought me lunch as an apology for being dreadfully late, even though I protested (not too vigourously, it must be admitted).  Since people have been asking me to, I'll try to update this blog more often.   Here's another drink recipe for those who also keep asking me for them. Today's drink is Bellini, also known as a Peach Bellini. Invented in Harry's Bar in Venice during the early years of the 20th Century, it's named after the Venetian Settecento (that's 17th Century for you illiterati) painter Bellini. The recipe itself is very simple. Start with White Peaches. White peaches are Chinese in origin, the sort one sees in Chinese paintings, a pale yellow-white with a very pronounced pink blush. They were introduced to the West only with Marco Polo's travels. Puree your white peaches, then strain. 1/3 strained peach puree with 2/3 prosecco (or champagne or any sparkling wine) in a shaker with ice, shake, then serve in tall champagne flutes. The key to this drink is the peaches - they have to be absolutely fresh, and packaged peach juice or peach puree is not to be used. I got quite addicted to this drink last summer when I was working in Florence - it's light, fruity, sparkly and very very classy. Do not try to make it stronger by adding vodka, grappa, peach schnapps or suchlike - it's a fallacy to think double the alcohol, double the fun. Adding too much alcohol merely spoils the taste of the the drink and the balance.

      Learned two lessons today.   1) Never trust people simply because you went to school with them. A former schoolmate is now a dentist in a Government polyclinic, and I asked him if he could do some minor work on my teeth. Now, I asked him that since the Government polyclinics have waiting lists of months, and I can't really afford to pay more than public health service prices (Dad's not paying for it, I am), if he could fit me in somewhere. He said he's moonlighting in various private clinics, so I should go look for him there. Which seemed fair enough, and he knew I was asking because I'm not exactly the richest person around. So alright, I go look for him in Toa Payoh this evening, he does two small fillings, we small talk, and then the nurse writes out a bill for $120. Ouch. Talk about being fleeced. There's a saying we have in Cantonese, which works out in Mandarin pinyin (because I have no idea how to enter Chinese into a blog) as Yi2 Ren2 Xin1 Bu4 Ke2 You3, Fang2 Ren2 Xin3 Bu4 Ke2 Wu2 - which works out to literally to "Suspect People Heart Cannot Have, Defend People Heart Cannot Lack". It's difficult to translate but it works out to something like "A heart full of suspicion is bad, but a heart on guard is a necessity". Expensive lesson, one I shan't be forgetting.   2) As soon as I came out of the Dentist's room, I showed my touched-up front teeth to mum and dad, and we talked about it in Shanghainese, as is our wont when speaking in public and not wishing others to understand or overhear. There's this lady standing at the counter waiting to be served, her head whips over and starts staring at us. It seems she'd just been fleeced before me, and she walks over and asks us how much we're being charged. In FLUENT Wu Language (of which Shanghainese is a version). We nearly fall over and die, as the reason we speak in Shanghainese in public is so no one can follow... anyway, we have some trouble understanding her as she has a thick accent of some sort. She claims she's from Soochow (that's Suzhou for you pinyin nazis), but her accent wasn't a Soochow accent, it was far too country peasant. Lesson? Don't assume no one around understands you when you speak in another language.   Follow up to that last bit. Mum (who was born and spent her childhood in Shanghai) recounted the time when she was in Hongkong (this is in the 50s) and in a bus with another Shanghai girl, and this young Indian chap, black as night, sat next to them. The two of them spoke to each other in Shanghainese about how bad he smelled. After all, who would expect an Indian fellow in Hongkong to understand? Later that evening, there was a gathering of airline staff (mum worked for a short while in HK for BOAC, the precursor of British Airways) and guess who was there? Indeed, that very Indian chap, who turned out to be the fiance of the Air India manager, born and bred in Shanghai, the scion of an Indian family that had lived and worked in Shanghai for several generations and had only just come out of Communist-occupied China. Needless to say, he spoke flawless upper-class Shanghainese. Mum was so embarrassed.  More later!

      Alright, updates coming soon.  I can't find the recipe anywhere on the web, so as a service to humanity, here's a recipe for a drink I learned the last time I was in Venice. The name is "sgropino" - the "s-" prefix meaning "dis-" and "grop" meaning "lump" in Italian. So it works out to something like "dislumping", and it's meant to be drunk after a heavy rich meal to get rid of that lump in your chest.   Place a scoop of lemon sorbeto/sorbet/sherbert in a tall glass, add one measure of grappa or vodka, top up with prosecco (or any sparkling wine). Voila, you have Sgropino.  2 oz Vodka or Grappa 2 cups of Prosecco, Italian sparkling wine or 2 oz Champagne- doesn't matter which, as long as it's not dry stuff. 2 cups lemon gelato/sorbet/sherbert Mix all in a blender for 30 seconds This gives you about 4 servings - or 2 large glasses.  I've done variations including substituting various sorts of sherberts - orange, pink grapefruit, mango... then in place of the prosecco, simply using lambrusco or when feeling indulgent, champagne. Honestly, I find lambrusco works better because it's sweeter. One favourite variation so far is Mango sherbert, grappa, pink lambrusco.   Oh and Happy New Year.

       But perhaps my favorite example of character creation involves the artificial westernizing of the third-person pronoun. Like other kinds of Chinese, spoken Mandarin has only one third-person personal pronoun (tā). It was traditionally written 他, a character with a person 人 as the radical on the left side. Apparently under the pressure of Western languages, which distinguish "he," "she," and "it" Chinese in recent decades have created a new character for tā in the sense of "she" which replaces the sexually indeterminate person 人 with a 女 woman: 她, gradually restricting 他 to mean specifically "he." Another character, originally an alterantive writing for 他, has been pressed into service for tā in the sense of "it": 它.  On the model of 他 and 她, other characters have occasionally been proposed for tā when it refers to an animal 牠 or a god 祂. To the best of my knowledge all of these (except 他 itself) are XXth century creations. The fact that they are in computer fonts suggests how common they have become.   Similarly, some sectarians who worship a mother goddess have created an underground glyph made by turning one of the conventional symbols for "mother" 母 on its side to produce . This is used in sectarian tracts and as a decorative motif to refer to the mother goddess. In recent decades it has been possible to get arrested for writing the character 母 this way. (Don't show this page to a late Imperial or modern Communist official! And don't ask how it got into my computer.)  Then there are the obscene characters invented to be scribbled by rude schoolboys on the walls of public johns. An oldish one of these is made by placing the radical "enter" 入 atop element "meat" 肉 to produce an obscene graph referring to sexual intercourse 肏. It is somewhat shocking to discover this in the Unicode Consortium's code list; it was certainly not in the original Chinese national standards. The word is pronounced cào, in case you feel like being a rude schoolboy.   from a page  urlLink on the Chinese Language .

        Your wings are  DRAGON  wings. Massive and covered in scales, they shimmer with strength and magic. They are the most obvious display of your power - though it runs equally throughout your heart and mind. You are uncompromising and grave, with a profound sense of justice. You have firm ideas about what is right and what is wrong and set out to fix what problems you can. You realize that you are more capable of dealing with life and evil than most, and as such you see it as your responsibility to protect those who cannot defend themselves. You have existed since antiquity and as such you are wise far beyond your years in this lifetime. While you strive for fairness and peace, if someone should steal from your cave of treasure (though not all that glitters is gold) or compromise the happiness of you or one who is close to you - they have signed their death warrant. You have a mighty vengeance and will unleash it upon such people immediately and mercilessly. Arguing with you is useless...you rarely back down and are known for holding firm in your beliefs. Sometimes you feel intensely burdened with the troubles of others...acting as a Guardian can get so wearisome. But you never give up...you see it as your life's mission. Often very introverted, you can be so smart...it's scary. Such a combination of intelligence, creativity, power, beauty, and magic is often intimidating to those around you - who are also unlikely to understand you. Arrogant, proud, overserious, and sometimes a bit greedy or obsessed with whatever treasure you choose to pursue...you have enchanted people for centuries, and will continue to do so.  urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Haven't blogged in a bit. Arrived in Peking early Monday morning, on business with Dad (who got here 2 days ago). Dad very sagely told me to look out, upon arrival, for him - "how can you miss me - I'm chinese!". Yeah. Right. In PEKING airport?   First, I've realised  urlLink China blocks blogspot.com  - I can thus post and edit all I want, but can't read my own posts or or friends' blogs. Slightly annoying. More about it here.   On the plane, I was asked "Noodles or Porridge?" in contrast to western carriers which ask which protein one wishes to have. Curious, because it shows the difference between East and West - in the East, one's starch is considered the primary component of one's meal - the protein bits （when available）being merely accompaniments to it.   At the end of the flight, a tinny voice announced, among other things, "we hope you have enjoyed our in-flight entertainment". I was certainly entertained by the antics of the mainlanders - a whole flight full of country bumpkins returning to the motherland after a holiday.   Bird flu in China? They're not taking any risks. Chicken is entirely unavailable in Peking, and hasn't been for a whole month. One won't find it for sale ANYWHERE. Peking says NO CHICKEN and no chicken is found anywhere. It's one of those things about the Chinese - thousands of years of absolute obedience to the Emperor means when the central government takes reasonable measures, the people obey. It's not some mess like Thailand where sick and dead birds get sold on the cheap secretly.   Amusingly enough, Kentucky Fried Chicken gets sold fine here - they've got strict controls and the Mayor of Peking actually checked their farms and ate at their restaurant to show it was fine. Money talks, I imagine.   How's business?　I'm bored to tears, naturally. Sitting and having to listen to long discussions about satellite capability in Mandarin, spending time with old Communist Party cadres.... is not my idea of an enjoyable time at all.   Food's hearty - very oily and very rich, but then that's typical Northern Chinese food. Weather's cold - it's about -7 today.   Alright, I've got a free day today. Time to go shopping for fake and pirated goods, and the company driver's taking our Norwegian guests to the Great Wall, so I have to go along to play host. Pictures will be posted when I get back and figure out how to post pictures on a blog.  urlLink    Lent began on Monday for us Byzantine Christians - Orthodox and Catholic, so I ask the forgiveness of all I have offended or sinned against in this past year. Please forgive me, in order that our Lord may forgive us all, as we sail on the sea of the Great Fast. I　can't fast while travelling on business, I'll start when I return this weekend.  Here's the Lenten Prayer of St Ephraem, which we say several times a day:  O Lord and Master of my life take from me the spirit of sloth faint-heartedness, lust of power and idle talk.  But give rather the spirit of chastity, humility, patience, and love to thy servant.  Yea, O Lord and King grant me to see my own errors and not to judge my brother; for Thou art blessed unto the ages of ages.  Amen.       A sermon is available  urlLink here .

I'm not a fan of the Harry Potter series. Not that I dislike it, I merely don't see what the fuss is all about. However,  urlLink this  sounds interesting, an Englishman's translating Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone into Ancient Greek. It may just be the thing I need to persuade me to start reading Rowling's stuff. It'll look great next to my Winne the Pooh in Latin and Asterix comics in Ancient Greek and Latin.

      天下有二难登天难求人更难， 人间有二苦黄连苦贫穷更苦， 天下有二险江湖险人心更险， 人间有二薄春冰薄人情更薄; 知其难守其苦测其险忍其薄， 可以处世矣。  Translation:   Under heaven are two difficult things: to ascend the sky is difficult, to beg people even more so.  In the human realm are two bitter things: Huanglian(1) is bitter, poverty even more so.  Under heaven are two dangerous things: Jianghu(2) is dangerous, human hearts even more so.  In the human realm are two thin/fragile/false things: spring ice thin/fragile/false, humanity/humankindness even more so. Know these difficulties, bear these bitternesses, foresee these dangers and bearing these falsenesses, Only then can you do great things.  (1) Huanglian is a sort of medicine, particularly bitter.  (2) Jianghu is the world of itinerant martial artists who go about brawling. it's a bit like the underworld.   This came from a piece of calligraphy which hangs at home - it's cynical, but true. The sooner these lessons are learned, the better. I know it's in the crappy simplified characters which i hate, but I'm still learning how to input Chinese into the computer...

I hope it make it to screens in Singapore.   ====   urlLink This  is an interesting thread:    Ebor  says:   "Many years ago, a friend of mine observed that protests by animal rights persons like PETA against the use of furs and hides (throwing red paint and such)  were aimed at smaller women in fur coats, who probably wouldn't fight back much, rather then a 6'2"  biker in leathers.  Bullying, I calls it."   I agree, of course.  Schultz ' reply was:   "It's funny you bring that up, Ebor, because I was witness to how the PETA folk can cower when faced with their own medicine.  While walking in downtown Pittsburgh (near Kaufmann's, Bro Max!) a group of PETA folk were picketing a nearby store that sold furs and actually did do the red paint thing on a passing woman who was probably in her 50s or 60s.  She started cussing up a storm at the perpetrator, who told her to go ahead and call the police, he wasn't afraid to go to jail for what he did.  That prompted a rather large biker-type, who was easily as tall as I am and 50 pounds heavier (so we're talking 6'5" 300#), dressed in full leathers, to come over and say, "If you're so against people wearing fur, then throw that &*%$ on me, you little *&##%$!  You may not be afraid to go to jail, but are you afraid I'm going to pound your little #@*( into the ground?"  The demonstration broke up very soon afterwards and the biker made sure the guy who threw the paint went nowhere until the local constabulary arrived to haul him away."

      For years many health professionals have been encouraging us to eat margarine and stay away from that unhealthy, fat-containing, cancer-causing, complexion-ruining, home-wrecking, what more can I say? Butter.  BUT, DID YOU KNOW...         o Both have the same amount of calories.        o Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams.        o Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study.        o Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods. Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added.        o Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavours of other foods.        o Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less then 100 years.  Now for Margarine...        o Very high in Trans Fatty Acids. Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease        o Increases total and LDL ( this is the bad cholesterol). Lowers HDL cholesterol and this is the good one.        o Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold.        o Lowers quality of breast milk. Decreases immune response. Decreases insulin response.  And here is the most disturbing fact....        Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE from being PLASTIC...!!!!        (This fact alone should have us all avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated. This means Hydrogen is added changing the molecular structure of the food.)        Youcan try this yourself.        Purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or a shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things. No flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it, (that should tell you something) It does not rot, or smell differently...Because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it, even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not find a home to grow...Why? Because it is nearly plastic. Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast?  Have a look at these articles  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  and then decide.   I've convinced my family to use butter again after years of margarine, and what's the result? We've actually lost 3 kg each (but then we're also following the Hay system of eating which makes us feel better). Butter tastes SO much better than margarine.   Hurrah for butter! Use it often and liberally... and rejoice  =)

      Soundtrack: "Kayama" by ATB  After acupuncturist session, had a lovely tea buffet of Pekinese dim sum at  urlLink Lao Beijing . 'tis one of my regular haunts, as they do a buffet of Northern and Shanghai style stuff such as the Siew Long Pau, meat buns and suchlike... every weekend and public holiday. It's great value , and the food's authentic too. Mum proclaims their Sang Tseen Pau the best she's had since leaving Shanghai in '49. If you think I'm doing a plug for them, you're right - they're good. And it's only $12.   Mum's convinced I've inherited her Shanghainese roots... the passion for Shanghainese language and the penchant for Shanghainese food. Shanghainese food has a combination of sour aromatic vinegar and molasses sugar that's addictive. If you're looking for good Shanghainese food in Singapore, I'd recommend two places.   One is Old Shanghai at Smith Street in Chinatown. Here's a  urlLink review  of the place done by someone who obviously doesn't know Shanghainese food and ended up ordering all the wrong dishes. Dishes that are typically Shanghainese there include: Marinated Chekiang Ham Hock, Sugar and Vinegar Pork Ribs, Lion's Head Meatballs, Fried New Year Cake, Wontons in Chilli Oil, anything with Green Beans. The Lion's Head Meatballs are a must-have. If anybody wants to try the place... gimme a call and we'll arrange an outing. It's useful to speak Shanghainese as the boss is Shanghainese and once gave me a table ahead of all the Singaporeans waiting in line... because I spoke to her in Shanghainese (none of the Singaporeans understood) and thus qualified as an "Tse Ga Nying" or "own people".   The other is along Liang Seah Street, and is called Xian De Lai. This place does useful 2-6 person lunch sets in the afternoon. At night they do a roaring business in Northern Chinese steamboat, which differs from the Southern version in that they use an excellent spicy soup.   Popped down to Bras Basah yesterday after Lao Beijing and picked up a calligraphy brush for small characters (the less flexible a brush is and the more finely-pointed the hairs are, the better for small characters). Also picked up a few practice sheets of absorbent paper. These things are blue, and only a wet brush (no ink) is required on them - the wet bits turn dark blue-black. the sheets dry quickly, so they're very useful for when one cannot be bothered to grind ink. True, ink-grinding's meditative and soothing.. but I'm lazy often.   My calligraphy's still crap, but it's getting better! One's calligraphy reflects one's character. Mine's pretty accurate a reflection of my character - messy and erratic and all over the place.

      Soundtrack: "Drewie's Accordes" by an anonymous Elizabethan composer, a duet for two lutes, played by Paul O'Dette and Jakob Lindberg.   I've had this chronic pain in my arms every evening for about two weeks, pure fire from the fingertips of the last three fingers of both hands to the elbow. I've an appointment with NUH Neurology this wed, but till then I'm on painkillers that don't seem to work. Sometimes I wake up from the pain and can't sleep. What's really weird is when the arms hurt and the left leg twitches too. One night my parents were worried cos I woke up screaming. Let's not forget those strange raised bumps on my hands and feet that appear in the evenings and disappear by noon... they're like mosquito bites, but sore in addition to itching in a most vexatious fashion. For weeks I thought I had a mosquito problem in my room, but there's no reason they'd concentrate on palms of my hands and soles of my feet and not bother with other softer fleshier bits where the skin's thinner. Mum and I think they're allergic reactions of some sort - the sore bumps are almost symmetrical on right and left limbs. My lower back pain from the hunting injury years ago is also back to bother me.   At this point I'm beginning to  feel like Molière's La Malade Imaginaire (The Hypochondriac)... I can just hear Charpentier's overture playing in the background...  So alright, things were getting a tad out of hand (ha ha). Parents and I figured while waiting for NUH neurology, it couldn't hurt getting a Chinese physician's opinion on the matter. So we found one in Chinatown, and he agreed it seemed a matter for the neurologist. Meanwhile, he'd do some Chi-clearing to help smoothen the flow of the Chi and give me some herbs to help soothe the system. Oh, and he'd also do a bit of acupuncture. So there I lay on a table, with 4 needles in my neck and upper back, one in the left forearm and another in my left thigh. No, insertion of the needles didn't hurt at all. The doc twiddles with them and twaddles the ends a bit, then attaches an electric current to the needles. A curious throbbing tickling ensues, and a warm sensation around the needles. I fall asleeep for half an hour and wake up with the pain in my arms and back gone.   The doc gives me some herbal concoction in a bottle, with directions to drink 10ml thrice daily, and to take some herbal pills (with sugar coating). The concoction tastes appallingly bad, and Dad assures me that old Chinese believe good medicine never tastes good, so they intentionally make it smell and taste horrid.   I'm a believer in acupuncture now.  It is important to understand that Acupuncture (and Traditional Chinese Medicine in general), is not "folk medicine". It is a highly developed, systematic, recorded, researched, and peer reviewed form of medicine with several disciplines that continues to evolve. It has a massive amount of real-world data to justify the application of techniques based on several thousand years of human trials.  Throughout the world, lay-persons have adopted the techniques far more readily that scientists because they do not have to understand how it works to take advantage of it. From janitors to high-profile quarterbacks, the word is out... it's cheap, it's painless, and most importantly... it works.  What happened after? The raised welts came back at night, but far fewer and far less irritating. There wasn't much pain. When pain goes, I'm not really bothered where it's gone.

      Soundtrack: "About Us" by Christophe Goze, from his "Show Me The Way" album. Interesting, from that amorphous genre known as "lounge".   Housework is immensely fulfilling - the feeling that I'm actually doing something is therapeutic. What I don't understand is where the dust that accumulates on our floors comes from. We don't open the windows that much, so I can't figure out whence this dirt comes. I'm convinced there's a colony of gnomes living in the house that sets to work every night after we go to bed, gleefully sprinkling dust and dirt out of their little magic bags onto our floors while humming a merry tune. I can just picture them all having a little chuckle and rushing back into their hideouts before we awaken.   Soundtrack: "Two Princes" by Spin Doctors.  I've been trying to figure out why I have a distinct aversion to the genre of music known as "Rhythm and Blues", or "RnB" for short. For a long time I hadn't a clue what it was, thinking it was vaguely similar to Blues, of which I'm quite fond. Then I actually heard some and an instant dislike developed. For a while I thought I didn't like the "blackness" of the sound, then upon further analysis, this didn't work, as I love Jazz and African ethnic music. Was it simply the noise level? Impossible, as I'm fine with Trance. Then it struck me - I hate rap for the same reason. It's the level of black american gangster "feel" in the music. There's a certain barbaric quality about it that I don't like. The glorification of violence, anti-intellectualism and cheapening of the sexual act in that "culture (even to call it "culture" is to be generous)... not to mention the bad manners... go against all that I hold dear and stand for. Perhaps I think too much. I'm certain that in Heaven there will be much Jazz, Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, Palestrina, Josquin and Dufay... but absolutely no "gangsta rap" or RnB.

      I came across this newspaper article from a respectable paper which I felt had to be shared with everyone here... ENJOY!  ---   'Rings' characters discuss Oscar snub   by Molly J. Ringwraith   Jan. 27, 2004 MINAS TIRITH (AP) – The city of Minas Tirith has been abuzz today over the news that 'The Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King,' while receiving 11 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, did not receive any nominations for acting.  "Eleven nominations?" said Pippin Took, of the Shire. "Well, that's good news."  His friend Meriadoc Brandybuck responded by swatting him over the head with the newspaper and protesting, "But the cast is a part of this movie! Aren't they?"  Their kinsman Frodo Baggins shared Brandybuck's dismay. Upon reading the list of nominations, Baggins commented with an ironic chuckle, "They've left out one of the chief characters: the cast. I want to hear more about them." Waxing solemn and soulful, he added, "The movie wouldn't have got far without the cast."  "You almost don't want to watch the awards ceremony," contributed Baggins' gardener and loyal valet, Samwise Gamgee, "because how can it be happy? How can the awards go right when so much bad has been nominated? Folks in that Academy had lots of chances of voting for these actors, only they didn't."  Legolas Greenleaf, of the Mirkwood realm, commented somewhat cryptically on the Academy's choices, "A red sun rises. Lame decisions have been made this night." When asked to clarify his opinion, he told reporters that he had not the heart, for the grief was still too near, and retired for a walk in the forest.  His companion, Gimli son of Gloin, had sharper remarks to make upon the chosen nominees. "Mystic River? What madness drew them there? You'll find more cheer in a graveyard!"  But wizard Gandalf the White urged a more optimistic approach. "Do not be too eager to deal out Oscars in judgement," he advised. "That is not for us to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the Oscars we are given."  Meanwhile, his colleague Saruman the formerly-White was in favor of retaliation against the Academy: "Too long have those peasants stood against us," Saruman said, referring to the Academy's failure to give any fantasy film the Best Picture Oscar yet. "Leave none alive! To war! There will be no dawn for film critics!"  Treebeard, of the Ents, told reporters after much deliberation and exchanging of long names, that he was in agreement with this proposed course of action. "There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men for this treachery," he declared. "My business is with Beverly Hills tonight. With heads made of cotton candy and rock."  "I do not doubt their hearts," Eomer of Rohan conceded. "Only the size of their brains." He then returned to the task of loading up forty of his men and horses with toilet paper and Maps to the Stars' Homes, for a "secret midnight mission" that he regretted he could not give details about.  At least one individual, calling himself Smeagol, claimed to be making plans to steal the Oscar statuettes. "Oscar is sooo pretty, sooo golden," said Smeagol. "We will take the statuesss once the Hollywood snobses are dead! Ye-esss, precious!" He then quickly added, groveling at the feet of reporters, "No! No! We were only joking! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! Nice movie industry." He crawled away before he could be questioned further.  Still others appeared not to care about the snub. Lady Eowyn of Rohan said with a shrug, "The women of this country learned long ago that those without Oscar nominations may still get dates to awards ceremonies. I fear neither critics nor fans." Lord Boromir, a native of Minas Tirith, dismissed the concerns, claiming, "Gondor has no actors. Gondor needs no actors."  But overall the mood was one of mild disgust. As Lord Aragorn put it to reporters, "The day may come when the Academy is able to find their ass with a flashlight. But this is not that day."

      Soundtrack: "For an Angel" by Paul van Dyk  Warning, skip the next paragraph if you're not in the mood to wade through a mishmash of Mediaeval Latin, Greek and some Italian.   Οιμοι κακοδαιμον... Ω Ζευ, εισακουσον μου! Quare dabes me multas curas? Est puer (un bellissimo raggazo... natator, naturalmente, μετα καλλιστος πυγος but i digress). Ονομα αυτου Αλβινος... et magna cura est hic puer, quia εταιροι cogitat σε ερωταω, και ενος των εταιρων αυτων σημαινει μοι... λεγων οτι melior me stare verberatis super eum. non totalmente innocens sum, naturalmente, sed non nunc super eum verbero! Fatuus est... cogitare possibile est me conquassare et timere. Est alter puer, sed nunc non dicabo περι αυτου...  ACJC's Rashomon went well-ish, but whoever designed the sets and costumes needs to look a lot closer at Japanese aesthetics before attempting to set something in Japan again. Someone has to tell the set designer that lots of Red is not Japanese, but extremely Chinese. Red and Black. Tres Chinoiserie. The entire thing looked like something out of  urlLink Hero . Next, not everybody wears identical kimonos in Japan - Samurai and most men in mediaeval Japan wore  urlLink Hakame , a sort of trousers.  urlLink This  is how they're worn. There were three huge tacky red banners and the central one had the characters for Ra-sho-mon on them. Trust an AC production to also get the Chinese characters (the Japanese call them Kanji or Chinese Characters) wrong - they missed out a stroke, and the whole calligraphy was appallingly bad. This coming from a lover of Chinese calligraphy who tries very hard to get the strokes right but still can't quite wield a brush properly... but at least I can tell when it looks good, and I suspect my own calligraphy would've been better.   Can't say I'm a huge fan of modern styles of theatre, but then I'm classically trained, so what else can one expect?   Watched  urlLink Last Samurai  on Sunday afternoon. Excellent, first time I've cried at a film since...Joy Luck Club, if I recall correctly. It's one of the most beautifully crafted films I've seen in a long time. Most  urlLink reviewers  seem to like it.   Monday was a public holiday, a Mahometan festival. I went over to where Ten Yeen (my harpsichordist and accompanist) lives, far in the East of the island, to go thru some songs by Noël Coward. Ten Yeen lived and worked in Thailand for some years, and she brought back some lovely Burmese and Thai sarongs and fishermen's trousers. she gave me one of those  urlLink fishermen's trousers  - extremely comfortable, in grey cotton. How're they worn?  urlLink Like so . I took a fancy to a sarong that was of blue-grey material and had black borders top and bottom. She said she'd let me have it if I'd wear it out. So I did. I spent the rest of the afternoon in Holland Village and in town, in a dark blue teeshirt and what was effectively a skirt. Friends I hung out with couldn't get used to it. a few stares, a few raised eyebrows... a surprising number of approving smiles. I suspect if one wears it with confidence... Oh, and it's extremely comfortable.   Curiously, it felt liberating and a very new experience. It didn't feel feminine at all, oddly. Well, maybe because it is so not a question of sexual preference or identity. I don't have any straight friends with balls enough to wear a sarong (yet an ex boyfriend of mine's gone out in one before, and he's more masculine than most straight guys). Besides, it’s unisex, stupid — if all it takes to make you question your sexual identity is a garment, you've got more questions than I can answer, RuPaul.   See, the thing about wearing a sarong is that, as a man, you have to have a certain confidence, a certain arrogance. You must be absolutely secure in your manhood — flat out — or it won't come off well. You'll look like a man in a skirt: clumsy, misplaced and utterly ridiculous. In a wrap, whatever where-with-all you have as a man is up for scrutiny: you've created an artificial vulnerability that requires strength to secure. Plainly speaking, a man in a sarong projects an audacity and demands a respect that khakis don't. Fact is, you might not be man enough to pull it off.  Curious? Have a look at this  urlLink website  that sells skirts for men. Not half bad looking. For more information, visit this  urlLink site .   Had a haircut yesterday, so I now have short blue hair. Quite an interesting look. Spent the afternoon and early evening with Yen. Marcus Goh came along and joined me for dinner after Yen left... Kenn Chia also had dinner with us and all three of us had a drink at the Hilton's bar afterwards. Caveat - don't order Caipiriñas at Hilton - the bartender doesn't know how to make it properly.

      英雄所見略同 - a Chinese proverb, literally "heroes who meet agree", something along the lines of "great minds think alike.  三人寄れば文珠の知恵。 - A Japanese proverb this time! the transliterated Japanese is  San nin yoreba monju no chie , which means “three people together have the wisdom of a Buddha”; or as we would say in English, “two heads are better than one”. A related proverb plays on the fact that the Chinese character for  kashimashii  (“noisy, clamourous”) is made up of three small versions of the character for “woman”:  女三人寄れば姦しい。  Or  Onna san nin yoreba kashimashii  (“where three women gather, there is a noisy clamor”). As Kittredge Cherry points out in her book  Womansword: What Japanese Words Say About Women :        Of all the characters imported from China, [kashimashii] is almost always the first example that springs to mind when linguistic sex discrimination is discussed. Three women add up to a sin worse than noise when the same character is pronounced kan. This spells wickedness or mischief, and it can be stretched into the verb form kansuru, meaning to seduce, assault, or rape. The hidden corollary to the kashimashii character is that a trio of men getting together is nothing remarkable. There is no character composed of three male ideograms. In fact, the male symbol almost never appears as a component of other characters.       Other words reinforce the concept that women can cause a hubbub. In old Japan, the most likely spot for women to gather was beside the well (idobata) where they drew water and washed clothes, so the term “well-side conference” (idobata kaigi) is still used to describe a group of gossiping women. The word for chatterbox (oshaberi), which literally means “honorable talker,” is almost always used to describe—or put down—a woman. Gossip is considered something women do, while there are few similarly derogatory terms for men who babble about trivial topics.

        You are the San Damiano Cross: Rich in symbolism, this cross was first painted in the twelfth century gathering images from the Gospel of John. Christ is the central figure and is surrounded by the angles, the apostles and the Virgin Mary. The cross became well known because it was the cross in front of which St. Francis was praying when he received the call to rebuild the Church.  urlLink   What Kind of Cross are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Soundtrack:  Kyrie  from  Missa Pange Lingua  by Josquin Desprez. This has to be the most exquisitely beautiful Renaissance polyphonic mass ever written, and based on the haunting  Pange Lingua  Hymn for Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi. Close runners up are Antoine Brumel's  Missa Et Ecce Terrae Motus  and Cristóbal De Morales'  Missa Mille Regretz .   Ripping my old CDs, which haven't been listened to in years, I find so much music I'd not listened to for so long. The sound of music that filled my life in happier and more carefree years washes over me and I find myself feeling much better than I have in a long time.   I'm currently listening to the Tallis Scholars sing Missa Pange Lingua by Josquin Desprez, and an assortment of memories fill my mind:  The way I was enthralled by this mass at the age of 13 when I first discovered it and how I memorised the Soprano part by ear, hoping to sing it one day.   Finding and buying the score in Sydney while ACS Choir was on tour in Australia, and trying to convince Grace Lo, the then conductor, to let us sing it.   How I finally realised my voice had broken - I could no longer do the melismatic passages in the Credo of the mass smoothly and without my voice cracking.   How I heard this mass performed twice in a day, on Corpus Christi no less- in the Chapel of King's College Cambridge during an Anglican morning Eucharist and then in Westminster Cathedral, London, in the evening during a Sung High Mass (I travelled from Cambridge to London in between).  How I made a friend in a London pub one quiet afternoon by absentmindedly humming an extract from the mass while making my way from the bar counter to my seat and one chap yelled out "MISSA PANGE LINGUA!". Turns out he'd conducted that mass with a choir in San Diego.  How I was thrilled to discover intabulated versions of movements from the mass for lute - by Fuenllana, Valderrabano, Dalza, Narvaez... and how some of them are fiendishly difficult to play on lute, but how I still try.  I STILL want to perform this mass one day.

      I've come to the conclusion that keeping a blog's easier than keeping a homepage. This it is, that my website (not updated since 1999) will be redesigned (when I get round to it) to serve as subsidiary links for my blog. I'm playing around with the html for the blog, and it feels just like when I started working on the html for my website back in 1996. I've just added a tagboard for friends who drop in and want to leave a note =)

I happened not to have anything with my age and picture on it (I've not looked 18 for over a decade), and the doormen wouldn't let me in. Uh. I don't look below 18, no amount of wishful thinking will make it so. Oddly, Bruce didn't get checked, and he's just 19!  Very very bizzare. I got in eventually anyway.

At a Presidential Office press conference, Secretary-General to the President Chiou I-jen said that the president was wounded in the belly and that the vice president was hit in the right knee. The injuries are not life-threatening, and both candidates are fully conscious. They were taken to Tainan's Cimei Hospital for treatment.    In case readers weren't aware, Taiwan's elections are tomorrow. Those of us who know Taiwanese politics will know that Ah-Bian (Chen Shui-bian's nickname) and his Vice President Annette Lu (死臭婊子- pardon the crudity but it's true) is fully capable of staging a stunt like this. Christian charity forbids me to say where exactly I think both of them should received the bullets, and how many more they ought to have received, for their disgraceful efforts to split Taiwan from China.

      Current object of sartorial lust - a  urlLink cloak . I want a nice black woolen cloak.        Wool, for use in winter - it'd replace an overcoat. Full-circle, then I can ride and raise my arms and it'd still cover me. Black, because it'd work with black-tie or tailcoat and be elegant enough for night, yet be wearable during the day too. With a silver clasp, not too elaborate, but elaborate enough to look period. With a hood, because a hood is useful - if I get one without a hood, the time will come when I wish I had one - be it for inclement weather or anonymity. Great for period re-enactment stuff too!  There are some other gorgeous cloaks  urlLink here  - dammit, I want them all!

Look at all the dumb cute jocks in my life.    clever cute boys tend to be sluts.  Oh boy, don't get me started. But then plenty of the dumb ones are awflly slutty too.    decent clever cute boys tend to have issues, e.g. depression.  Oh yeah. OH YEAH. Brat Prince comes to mind. Together with all the rest of the screwballs in my life. I don't know why, but Rafflesians have always been trouble for me.    decent clever cute boys with no issues don't exist .  They live in the land of Prester John, I'm convinced of it.

      from  urlLink Rogue Classicism  and  urlLink Dappled Things , I find there is now a proper page for Vatican Radio's  urlLink The Latin Lover . The show features a weekly chat with Fr Reginald Foster, perhaps one of the best Latinists since the Renaissance and chief Latinist to the Pope of Rome. The  urlLink most recent offering  is a "virtual whistle-stop tour" of Julius Caesar's old stomps, in honor of the Ides of March. They make a tour of the  urlLink Area Sacra  of Rome -- an area of four temples of uncertain dedication. What's interesting is they associate the area with Julius Caesar and identify where Caesar was assassinated, among other things. This radio show is a great way to pick up vignettes of Roman history, Catholic culture, and some handy bits of Latin.

      from  urlLink Dappled Things :    urlLink Metrosexuals on the Rise  --   'Metrosexual' men beat girls at grooming:        'Metrosexual' man is on the increase, with men spending more time on personal grooming than women, according to research.      A report by Datamonitor shows that over the past five years, men's grooming time has increased to an average of 3.1 hours a week - compared to the average woman's 2.5 hours.      The report, which examines trends affecting the European market in grooming products, reveals changing attitudes in men towards looking after themselves....   Or, as someone told me the other day, "Well, Father, you know the Lord said to become as little children. Moisturizers and anti-wrinkle serum are my way of doing that." Hard to argue with that.   I don't know about you, but I detest the word  Metrosexual  - the English language already has enough words for men who spend too much time looking in the mirror.

(artcyclopedia.com.) Baroque Art is fairly realistic but is often willing to smudge the realism in favor of theatricality and the emotional pull that is its trademark. You're most likely a creative, talented emotional person who likes attention. Although it could all just be a show. Famous Baroquers (there are lots): Rembrandt, Rubens, Caravaggio, and You.    That's odd, because while I love Baroque art, it's not my favourite period. I much prefer Renaissance, Romanesque and Byzantine. Perhaps those options weren't available in the quiz. Either that or I'm just one hell of a drama queen.

"Kristallnacht is under way in Kosovo," the official told B92 on condition of anonymity.  "What is happening in Kosovo must unfortunately be described as a pogrom against Serbs: churches are on fire and people are being attacked for no other reason than their ethnic background," he added.  Serbs and UN officers have been the target of attacks by Kosovo Albanians during most of the day and night.  The most dramatic withdrawal was from Belo Polje on the outskirts of Pec, where UNMIK officials, retreating with Serb residents, where forced to shoot Albanian assailants in self-defence.  The Serbian Orthodox seminary in Pec has been razed, and Albanians celebrated its destruction by setting fire to the local church., said the UN official.    Anonymous submitter:  Please ask your ’blog readers for their intercession.    And thus it continues - shame on Nato and America for giving this bit of Christendom santified by the blood of countless martyrs under the crescent of Mahomet over to Albanian Muslim forces. The native Orthodox Church of the region is being persecuted to the ground and the Cross of Christ trodden underfoot - churches and monasteries that survived 600+ years of Turkish Mahometan domination are being destroyed daily by the Albanian terrorists who now rule the region. It is the duty of all Christians to at least say a prayer for the Church of Kosovo, if not go physically to their aid.

In fact, you seem to have a bit of a daredevil streak, and get a thrill out of living on the edge.

I'm glad he's mentally older than his age of 17 going on 18 this year, and doesn't react badly to my rakish escapades. He's a sweetie. He's done with debates (if that's at all possible) and is back to swimming training, hoping to swim in the Nationals later this year in July. All power to you, Howard!  Picked up a bottle of colgate's tooth whitening formula, let's see how well it works.

        urlLink Successful Strategic Bombing   :   The Popular Party’s error was trying to wage a cabinet war typical of the 18th century under modern conditions. In terms of national interests, Spain had nothing at stake in America’s war with Iraq. Polls indicated that the Spanish people were strongly opposed to sending the tercios to Iraq, by as much as 90%. But the Popular Party’s Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, saw a chance to get his name up in lights. And he did, with frequent invitations to the White House and even President Bush’s Texas ranch. He felt like one of the big boys, and the price seemed small – a few dead Spanish soldiers. Like Bush and Blair, he assumed that war could be a one-way street where only the enemy suffered.  And now he’s out in the cold, his party defeated in an election the polls said it would handily win. The Madrid bombings brought the war home to Spanish soil, which suddenly made Spain’s participation in it issue number one. Why was Spain in Iraq? The government had no answer, because there really was none.  Spain is not the only country whose government is playing the game of cabinet war. Britain’s involvement in Iraq is a cabinet war. So for that matter is America’s; Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, Saddam was not working with America’s real, Fourth Generation enemies and the United States had no vital national interests at stake. All over Europe, countries are "reforming" their militaries to prepare them for cabinet wars, wars in far-off lands where the key quality is "rapid deployment." Nations such as Norway have troops fighting in places like Afghanistan.  The whole notion that the 21st century can suddenly revert to the 18th and governments can fight wars in which the people and vital national interests are not involved is absurd. That is the real lesson of the Spanish election. War is no longer a "game of princes." The people are involved, and Fourth Generation opponents know how to make sure they are intensely involved, by bringing the war home to them.

      Here's a thought:  Chinese chilli-oil - the sort that has thick dried chilli paste in bright orange-red oil, which is favoured by Hongkongers and mainland chinese, is a great base with which to make Aglio e Olio sauce. Just add a bit more olive oil, and heat, and add garlic. Fabulous, as the chilli paste is intense and the oil it comes with highly flavourful to start off with!

        urlLink There MUST Be A Place For The Classics   -  To the very stupid, the study of Latin or Greek may appear a waste of time. To such people, these languages are "dead" and have no value... Part of the problem is down to the obsession with moving funding to those subjects and those departments which are commercially lucrative. In one sense, that strategy makes sense - where the public sector can work with private industry, it should do so. Certainly, creating tie-ups between the private and public sectors is a sensible move.  But that cannot become a justification for an obsession that each and every academic subject be commercially viable. IBM or Microsoft are never going to seek strategic alliances with classics departments of Scottish universities. But that does not mean that Latin and Greek have no worth. A government that does not see the difference between monetary value and educational worth is not one worthy of being in charge of Scottish education.  The obvious cognitive development, the likelihood of equipping children with the tools to learn other languages more quickly, and the awakening of some sense of the history of world civilisation are only a few of the points to consider. As important are the development of precise analysis and thought, a rigorous mental discipline and, with Latin particularly, an overwhelming emphasis on logic and deduction. Add to that an appreciation of grammar, and you have an utterly compelling case.

        urlLink Italian Police Break Into Church to Install Priest  -  Police in a small Italian town had to break into a church to let a priest take up his new job, thwarting a six-month blockade by parishioners devoted to his predecessor.  The faithful in the mountain town of Trasacco had jammed the church doors shut in protest after the Church transferred their Capuchin monk and sent a non-Capuchin to replace him.  So attached were parishioners to the Capuchins, who had served them for the last 430 years, that they briefly bricked the last friar into the local monastery to try to stop him leaving their town about 60 miles east of Rome. ...

      Cooked lunch for my parents, as they decided to gang up on me and insisted I cook. With whatever I could find around the house. I took the easy way out and made Fusilli with Aglio e Olio. That's spiral pasta with garlic and olive oil. It's one of the easiest sauces to make - one simply lightly fries minced garlic in olive oil (but not till it's brown), then add chopped chillies (I tend to use lots of both), remove from heat, add chopped parsley, salt, then stir through the cooked pasta. Extremely easy (no joke about it matching the cook please), highly flavourful and one can add a dollop of parmesan cheese if one so pleases.

      Two very beautiful and insightful quotes from Solzhenitsyn:   "If only there were evil people somewhere, insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"  "Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either, but right through every human heart, and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. Even within hearts overwhlemed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained; and even in the best of all hearts, there remains a small corner of evil."   Almost Zen-like, I think. Both quotes are from the  urlLink Gulag Archipelago  - if you don't know who Solzhenitsyn is or haven't read the Gulag Archipelago, I'd encourage you to read him. You'll be glad you did. Earlier on, I posted a summary in a blog post of what the Gulag Archipelago's about , that may be found  urlLink here .

      From  urlLink Lew Rockwell :   urlLink The Myth of Animal Rights  - Tibor R. Machan explains to PETA. Saying that animals don't have rights doesn't mean approving of animal torture or ignoring their pain.  "My point was, in essence, that rights are just not the sort of things animals other than people could have. Could animals have guilt, be blamed, feel regret and remorse, or apologize or anything on that order? No, and why so, that was the gist of my thesis: they are not moral agents like us, not even the great apes."    urlLink G-Strings and Baggy Pants  - Linda Schrock Taylor on the public schools' youth culture. What's particularly amusing is what she says about the baggy pants that seem so popular with youth today, especially those who like rap and hip-hop.  "I suspect that if more of our teen boys were told the original meaning behind the baggy pants, the fad would end soon enough. At a teacher in-service on gangs, a specialist who works with such groups informed us that the fad came straight out of the prisons. The speaker explained that in prison those baggy pants are the trademark of a prison prostitute and thus advertise availability. I find it so sad that our boys are unknowingly lured into dressing in such ways, and that those boys lack parents with the wisdom, and the stamina, to say, "Absolutely NOT!""

      Anecdote from dad:  On holiday with mum in Brazil in the late 60s, the two of them are at Rio airport waiting for a flight to Buenos Aires. The airport is not airconditioned, and it's a sweltering day. Next to them they notice a fellow in a heavy tweed coat and tie, sweating profusely. Dad suggests he might take his coat off. The reply, "What? Don't be silly! I'm an Englishman!"  Those of my readers who are older or understand classically British culture will understand the humour in this.

       urlLink Akropolis World News  - world news in Ancient Greek, would you believe? Text only, but great for keeping one's Ancient Greek in practice, as it's nice to have something other than the ancient texts to read.    urlLink Nuntii Latini  - a Finnish radio station's weekly broadcast of news in Latin. Excellent, even though the Classical pronuncation with a Finnish accent takes some getting used to. Transcripts available  urlLink here .   Of course, a problem common to both is the question of modern vocabulary: how can we say in Ancient Greek “Terrorist attempt with hand granades and machine-guns against a minister as he was landing with an airplane Boeing 747”? The only factible solution for words that do not exist in Ancient Greek is to take them from Modern Greek (both from Katharevousa and Demotiki) and to adapt them in form into Ancient, doing the necessary modifications for its framing into the declension or the conjugation that suits best. I mean, what is usually called “neologism”. For Latin, one has the Vatican, which comes up with lists of new words every so often, so at least there's some semblance of a linguistic authority.

      It being the 15th of March, I couldn't resist that title. =p  Why the Ides of March? Look  urlLink here . And in case you didn't know about the Roman system of dating the days in the month,  urlLink here's a link  explaining the complicated system of Ides, Kalends and Nones within a month.   Bright fresh and early in the morning, I sent text messages (that's SMS for you Singaporeans) to many people in my mobile phone list. The message read "Beware the Ides of March". A shocking number replied with "HUH???". Some got it and smiled. A few got the reference and replied in attempted Elizabethan english, which was nice. One guy, Marcus, replied with "He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass." - Caesar's next line in the play, and hence the correct response (which I wasn't really expecting). Considering Marcus is awfully handsome, has a great body and is extremely flirty, and that I used to have a crush on him... the crush might just come back now. After all, how many guys out there can reply with the succeeding line almost immediately?   I'm busy ripping my CDs into mp3 form. A recent discussion in PC Magazine sneers at those extremist audiophiles who might want encoding rates higher than 96Kbps, which seems to say that this rate is good enough for any ordinary person. Problem is, I'm not one of those ordinary persons - when one listens to Jazz and Classical, or when one is a trained musician with sensitive ears, things ripped at 96kbps sound terrible. I tried the Gloria from Mozart's Great Mass in C minor K427 - first ripped at 96kbps, and the louder sections were unbearably "shimmery", the strings were a bit shrill, and the woodwinds sounded, well, like plastic. Ripping at 64kbps was unbearable - with a clear "underwater" or warbling effect. I settled for 128kbps finally, and even that is lossy and nowhere as good as CD-quality.   Why do those silly tech journalists insist that mp3 is cd-quality then? I believe there are four reasons for this:      *   Hype : People want MP3 to work miracles, and they’re accustomed to Digital Technology as working miracles. Overstating the quality of MP3 recordings is par for the course.      *  Ignorance : Many people really don’t know what stereophonic music should sound like, and I suspect quite a few tech journalists fall into that crowd. If you’ve never heard anything better than a boom box, you’ve never heard what a CD should sound like.      *  Equipment problems : This is a variation on "ignorance," in one sense. If your equipment doesn’t offer decent reproduction, the loss of quality may not be audible. I used an inexpensive set of speakers for this test—much better than a boombox or a typical carry-along player, but nowhere near as good as a "mid-fi" stereo system. If you can’t hear the difference between a song played on FM radio and CD, you may not be bothered by MP3 sound. If you don’t care about the difference between AM radio, a cheap cassette player, and CD, then you certainly won’t mind MP3 sound.      *  Hearing problems : One supposes that those accustomed to listening to heavy metal, rock or electronic music wouldn't notice because they don't really know what real instruments sound like. However if you're accustomed to listening out for tiny nuances in performance, know what real accoustic instruments should sound like and can appreciate the tiny differences in tone quality between instruments made by different makers (say, lutes by Tieffenbrucker and Sellas, or violins by Stradivarius and Amati), then clearly one should rip mp3s at as high a rate as one can manage. A lot of people—particularly a lot of adult men—have significant hearing loss, and many of them really don’t care. Once again: if you can’t hear the difference, you won’t care about the difference.

      More on Passion!  from  urlLink Gen X Revert :   Total as of March 12th, 2004:  urlLink $264,041,000   Those who are "boycotting" the movie are doing some real damage eh?     urlLink Revisionism takes on ‘The Passion’  -  "Hundreds of movies about Jesus are rerun every Easter. Why would this new one bring out the critics? The reason is the Jesus depicted in the movie “The Passion of The Christ” is not the Jesus of the 21st century... The Passion is a visual depiction of the Jesus of the New Testament. This Jesus is not acceptable these days. I saw the movie the other night. Now I understand why the critics have labeled it as controversial. They do not want a suffering Jesus; they want a Hollywood Jesus. Mel Gibson is taking heat in the Hollywood community because he produced a movie about the wrong Jesus, a Jesus who willingly chose to undergo suffering and to go to the cross. What is the movie about? Simple stated, the movie is about the cross. Our society wants to deconstruct the image of the cross. The cross becomes a hip piece of jewelry for Madonna wannabes. It becomes a symbol of group identification. Contemporary theologians have deconstructed the cross as a symbol of political correctness. The cross is a symbol for love and tolerance for all views. It is a symbol of liberation from capitalism. The Passion confronts these reinterpretations of the cross and places the crucifixion as a horrendous event experienced by Jesus. Today’s church also is in danger of deconstructing Jesus in its own image."     Insightful, but that's what Protestantism has been doing since the 16th Century!

      From  urlLink Ut Unum Sint :    urlLink Gulf News: "Passionate portrayal of historical fact"    In the UAE Gulf News,  urlLink Dr. Ezzedin Ibrahim  comments on "The Passion of the Christ." He wonders what the Jews want--it seems to him to be clearly Biblical, and he quotes the pope as approving it.      Or are the Jews asking Christians to clear them, in past and present, of responsibility for Jesus' innocent blood and to solely hold the Romans guilty for his death? The fact is, Pilate, the representative of a cruel imperial power, was reluctant to crucify Jesus and finally washed his hands in front of the crowd to declare his innocence of Jesus' blood.      Anyway, the Jews attempted this in 1965, when Pope John XXV in his well-known Nostra Aetate, cleared the Jews of today from the guilt of killing Jesus, demanding that Christians treat them well.      Being a significant step to stop persecution against Jews, especially following the Nazi period, this noble attitude by the Pope was widely understood by people everywhere, although with reservation by some churches. Among those was the Coptic Church of Egypt whose Pope, Shenouda III, was a historian before being a theologian and knew the historical facts fully well.       He argued that if the forgiveness was meant for the Jews of the past, then Jesus himself had forgiven them. If the aim of the forgiveness was to ignore what had happened, then this would amount to twisting history and censoring facts.      He also said that forgiveness should be preceded by the acceptance of guilt, so had the Jews repudiated the crimes against Jesus to deserve this forgiveness? ...       Gibson is a member of a Catholic community that doesn't approve forgiving Jews for their killing of Jesus. This may be the reason behind his recent effort to keep this past event a living memory. This is surely an unpleasant memory.      ...the Romans wanted to satisfy the Jews, and convince them not to demand Jesus' killing.      However, even this bloody effort didn't pay because the Romans hadn't comprehended the Jewish philosophy of crucifixion. Jews believe that the "crucified are damned by God," so the priests insisted on the crucifixion of Jesus to demonstrate his damnation before their people....      Some critics say The Passion of the Christ contradicts the Nostra Aetate. But that argument is baseless because the Catholic Church has forgiven the Jews and not cleared them of the guilt....      Jews will attack the movie relentlessly, just as they have been lobbying for a long time against any American or European researcher who defies their version of historical events.   Dr. Ezzeddin Ibrahim is the Cultural Adviser to the Presidential Court of the United Arab Emirates--a "moderate Arab state."     urlLink "Mel Gibson's Pieta"    Traditionalist  urlLink Seattle Catholic  reviews "The Passion."      ...[T]he novus ordo culture produced Jesus of Nazareth. A staunch traditionalist gave the world The Passion of the Christ.      Mr. Gibson's willingness and ability to make this movie arose from the two things for which he is now attacked—first, his voluntary withdrawal, not from the Church, but from the novus ordo culture, and second, his staunch adherence to traditional Catholicism and all that it represents.

         We're all Crusaders now.    urlLink Reuters: Al Qaeda Letter claims Spain bombings.         Thursday's letter, a copy of which was faxed by al Quds newspaper to Reuters, said: "We have succeeded in infiltrating the heart of crusader Europe and struck one of the bases of the crusader alliance."    We don't know for sure if the letter's real, but my take is - the Crusades have never ended. The fight between Christendom and the armies of Mahometanism is merely temporarily suspended. Let no Christian ever forget that the Crusades were not a land-grabbing exercise against harmless Mahometans - it was a fighting-back and an attempt to regain for Christendom what had been forcibly stolen from us by invaders. For a bit of background, look  urlLink here  and  urlLink here (video link) . Now put this down in your notebook, because it will be on the test:   urlLink The crusades were in every way a defensive war.  They were the West's belated response to the Muslim conquest of fully two-thirds of the Christian world.   Once again, let no one harbour the illusion that the Crusades were an offensive war against peaceful Mahometans. Contrary to current myths, the Crusades were not a simple bloody campaign by Christian knights against the peaceful Mahometans of the Middle East. The truth is always more complex than the one-sentence explanation.   The Mahometans attacked first, unprovoked. I think Belloc put it something like this - "The Arab soldier found in the South of France cannot justly claim to be a peaceful farmer first disturbed in his vegetable garden outside Mecca".  Problem with calling a Crusade these days is, there's no truly Christian state anymore. The West has not been "Christendom" for many centuries. All we have left is the Vatican, which doesn't exactly have the greatest army. One may recall that when someone mentioned the Pope in Rome and warned Staling against open conflict with the Catholic Church, said "How may divisions does the Pope have?", but look whose empire fell in the end.   Let's not forget that the founder of the Mahometan religion was a violent man who would be a war-criminal wer he alive today.   The position that the modern decadent West is morally preferable to the Islamic world is dubious at best. Is the trash that is modern Europe, and America for that matter, really worth saving? Food for thought. But then what I want to save is not what it is now, but rather what it has been, and can be, is the point. Its Christian (note I don't add "Judaeo") roots are the source of both the good it has done and can do again.  Living under the shadow of Mahometanism (Islam) is a terrible thing. Ever heard of the concept of  urlLink Dhimmitude ? All non-Mahometans are second-class citizens under Islamic law, so I can't imagine why any Chinese in Malaysia would vote for the Islamic PAS party, for example.

      from  urlLink Ut Unum Sint :    Anti-religious psychological torture at Guantanamo ...    urlLink Jamal al-Harith , one of the Britons released from Guantanamo this week, is interviewed in the Mirror.      Jamal's most shocking disclosure centred on the use of vice girls to torment the most religiously devout detainees.      Prisoners who had never seen an 'unveiled' woman before would be forced to watch as the hookers touched their own naked bodies.      The men would return distraught. One said an American girl had smeared menstrual blood across his face in an act of humiliation.      Jamal said: 'I knew of this happening about 10 times. It always seemed to be those who were very young or known to be particularly religious who would be taken away.      'I would joke with the other British lads, 'Bring them to us - we'll have them'. It made us laugh. But the Americans obviously knew we wouldn't be shocked by seeing Western women, so they didn't bother.      'It was a profoundly disturbing experience for these men. They would refuse to speak about what had happened. It would take perhaps four weeks for them to tell a friend - and we would shout it out around the whole block.'  If this is true ... one can understand why American Muslim soldiers would be sympathetic toward the prisoners. If this is true ... it is an outrage against all religions. If this is true, and the other charges of torture ... I daresay we have lost whatever moral legitimacy we may once have been able to claim. More importantly, we have lost the war itself--if the war is seen as fundamentally a war of ideas and principles. This demands an immediate investigation.

      So yesterday I popped down to the pharmacy to see if I could find some antihistamines that I'm actually not allergic to. I've been having hives for nearly a month, and was prescribed prednisolone to control the itching. The docs neglected to tell me the side effects: rapid weight gain, mood swings, increased appetite and skin breakouts. No wonder I've been a grumpy spotty whale lately.  Had lunch with Kenley Kwan, Teh Zhiyu and Justin Lee (ώ καλλιστός νεάνιας). First time I'm actually meeting Justin, friendly enough chap. Had a bite to eat with Paul afterwards too. Oink, I say.   Soundtrack: " O Lord, save Thy people " - the Troparion of the Holy Cross sung by Slavyanka.       Before Thy Cross, we bow down in worship, 0 Master,  and Thy Holy Resurrection, we glorify   (Hymn of Veneration before the Cross).   It's the Third Sunday of Great Lent today, when we of the Byzantine Tradition commemorate the Holy Cross. Here's the Troparion Hymn to the Holy Cross:   Σώσον Κύριε τόν λαόν σου καί ευλόγησον τήν κληρονομίαν σου, νίκας τοίς Βασιλεύσι κατά βαρβάρων δωρούμενος καί τό σόν φυλάττων διά τού Σταυρού σου πολίτευμα.

This was an unofficial anthem of the Byzantine empire. What's it sound like? Click  urlLink here  for it in Greek.  urlLink Here 's a midi of it in the Russian version. If that sounds familiar, that may be because it was used by Tchaikovsky in his 1812 overture to represent the Russian army.

      From  urlLink Extreme Catholic  and  urlLink Dhimmi Watch :    urlLink Islam 'will be dominant UK religion'         Quoting the Gulf Daily News:          Islam will be the most widely practised religion in the UK by 2020, according to British and Muslim magazine editor Sarah Joseph.          She says mosque attendance is expected to outstrip church attendance over the next 16 years.          Estimates suggest that anywhere between 10,000 and 50,000 people a year convert to Islam in the UK, which is currently home to approximately 1.8 million Muslims.   Robert Spencer has some great comments on how Islam is being presented to Muslim youth in the U.K.  I want to add some points of hope:      * Freed from oppresive Muslim governments, many Muslims in the US stop practicing the faith, or as I pray, convert to the Catholic faith. The Catholic faith being the "purest of Christianity" in the Muslim worldview.     * Through mixing in with non-Muslim children, the Muslim children are learning tolerance and a less-biased version of history     * Through intermarriage the Muslim faith may not always be passed down to the next generation.   A few fears:      * Many Muslim communities are being undermined or being taken over by Wahhabists funded by Saudis.     * Many Muslim schools preach intolerance and a distorted history to children.     * With political skills and common appeal to the ACLU absolutists sin the suppression of Christianity, Muslims are able to get special rights as religious minority in school and in public life that would trigger a lawsuit if they were obtained by Christians.    This is still worrying. Eastern Christians have lived under the shadow of fierce warlike Mahometanism (Islam) for over a thousand years - it is NOT a religion of peace.

      from  urlLink Dappled Things :   Speaking of our conquest of the world,  urlLink this insightful site  explains the whole bit of the Pope kissing the Koran: it is the way of making Islam part of the Catholic Church and turning the Koran into canon law as part of Pope John Paul's scheme to turn the entire world into a Papal State. From the  urlLink main page , you can also learn more about the danger of reading the "satanic author"  urlLink J.R.R. Tolkien , who was a "friend of the dog,  urlLink C.S. Lewis ." We're talking some hard-core Bible-believin' here.   from  urlLink Rogue Classicism :   Caught in the daily scan is a piece on the  urlLink history of insults , which includes the following:      Like many good English words, "insult" started out as a good Latin word. "Insultare" means to spring on, or leap upon. An insult was originally an attack. It still is, only now, the attack is verbal.      The day of the snappy retort is not over. We just need to use our imagination to creatively "tell someone off." Unfortunately, the classic zinger is quickly becoming a lost art. It is easy to call a spade a spade, but to do it with style and grace takes practice. We seem to be content, however, to simply yell at each other, use racial epitaphs, or vulgar language.      Such was not always the case. In fact, an ancient Roman poet practiced the fine art of the acid tongue when he wrote, "I could do without your face, and your neck, and your hands, and your limbs, and your bosom, and other of your charms. Indeed, not to fatigue myself with enumerating each of them, I could do without you, Chloe, altogether."  The unnamed Roman poet, of course, was Martial and this is Epigram 3.53. Here's the Latin (via the  urlLink Latin Library ):      Et uoltu poteram tuo carere     et collo manibusque cruribusque     et mammis natibusque clunibusque,     et, ne singula persequi laborem,     tota te poteram, Chloe, carere.

      from  urlLink Lew Rockwell's Blog :    urlLink A plea for modesty      urlLink Anne Karpf  finds herself wondering if some of the old virtues were dismissed too quickly [thanks  urlLink Ladies Against Feminism ]. My favourite line: "...modesty is now almost invariably preceded by the word "false". It's seen as a defect, a sign of insufficient self-belief, marking you down as in dire need of a makeover to bring out your inner peacock."     urlLink Mel's Sweet Revenge     HollywoodReporter.com recently estimated very conservatively that Mel Gibson stands to personally pocket over $100 million from The Passion's U.S. sales alone. It's not out of the question that he could double that after international distribution.  How sweet Mel's revenge must be with regard to all those Catholic-hating Hollywood bigshots who refused to do business with him on this film. Frank Rich must have ground his teeth down to a nub over this news by now!      urlLink You Don't Watch TV!?      urlLink Great article , Karen and Brad, I had somehow missed it the first time. After reading some of it out to my wife, she mentioned that when she is substitute teaching at gov't schools she makes a point to tell the students that we do not get broadcast TV at home. The students' eyes get big and they look shocked and confused. They say things like, "You don't watch any TV? What do you do in the evening?" They really cannot imagine life without television. My wife patiently explains to them that we read books, we play games, we talk to each other, we attend lectures together and engage in many other activities that do not revolve around the TV. They blink and look uncomprehendingly at her as she says these things. My wife points out that this implies that these elementary, junior high and high school children are not being talked to, played with or read to. Very sad.

No, the ultimate foolishness is the belief by too many who should know better that voting in enough "good people" or grabbing the reins of the courts and the law is the ultimate victory, one that will enable them to "win" the "Culture War."

       urlLink Nutty Tibetans on Passion  -  "But now I see that it is not only Buddhas who reincarnate. It is also devils. The Romans in that film, the way they treated my friend, and all the Jews, I realized that the Communist Chinese of today are reincarnates of those Romans. The same tactics, the same policies.  "Jesus was in trouble from the moment someone called him king of the Jews, for there could be only one king of the Jews, Caesar. So it is for Tibet. The Dalai Lama is no longer recognized as head of state as had been the case for many centuries because there can be only one head of state, and now it must be Chinese. Just as the Romans did with Jesus, the Chinese torture and kill our brave monks and nuns who continue to seek Buddhahood. The message is the same, stay in line, do as we say, and perhaps all will be fine."    Oh, a fig to these nutty Tibetan secessionists.

      Soundtrack: DJ Sasha's " urlLink Airdrawndagger " album. Very ambient, not what one might expect from the dance master, but an intensely beautiful album nonetheless. It'd be great for parties and chilling out to.   I've gone and started up a second Friendster profile because I've hit 500 with the first one and that's the upper limit. I got called a Friendster slut by one friend, and another chipped in "why bring in Friendster?"  Was in the elevator today with a malay fellow whose phone ringtone was a recording of his young daughter saying "daddy, telephone call" in Malay. How very cute - "Bapak, talipon!"  Had my teeth scaled and polished today - they're white and luverly once again, hurrah!   urlLink To read or not to read  - New Shakespeare translations are the question. Can you believe some American students actually require translations of Shakespeare? Here's an example:   "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones."  --- Act 3, Scene 2.  "Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention. I have come here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths, but the good is often buried with them."  --- Same scene, "No Fear Shakespeare" translation.    Even our schoolchildren in Singapore, with many for whom English is not a first language, don't work with a crib of this sort. Disgraceful.        There, students volunteered to read aloud. Some cheered and booed the characters.   But they're excited about learning! Doesn't that make up for the fact that they're no longer learning anything?       At Sandy Creek, Kollias teaches students who are on track to attend college but have poor reading skills.   How can someone who has poor reading skills be "on track to attend college?" What happens when they get to college and can't do the work because their teacher didn't teach them how to read?       The story is so suspenseful, [another student] said she would have read it in the original text.      "But this means I don't have to think so hard about what the words mean and I can just relax and enjoy the story more," she said. ". . .And I am having a lot more fun reading it."   Well, that's what's important. Who needs to think in school, when you can have fun instead? God forbid you ever have to get a job some day and work for a living.

In this culture, one can probably find elite defenders of anything short of a snuff film. But a serious, biblically accurate account of Jesus Christ’s last hours on Earth is beyond the pale. I can’t recall any similar effort to shut down a movie, to destroy the reputation of a producer or to associate a project with the vilest half-truths and innuendoes. Why? Because the Gospel story still matters. It still offends. It still causes haters of the message to want to crucify, albeit figuratively, the messenger.

That wasn't easy to type, because the character mapping is annoying and counter-intuitive.   *shakes fist at Microsoft*  Alas, the woes of Classical scholars.

I would like myself to be a rent payer to the Lord; that I should suffer distress, that he would bestow a good blessing upon me.  I would like a great lake of beer for the King of Kings. I would like to be watching Heaven's family drinking it through all eternity.     Now that sounds like a pleasant thing to do!

        urlLink First gay Episcopal bishop to take reins in N.H. today     Robinson upbeat despite unrest within church   "..."I am having so much fun - it is such an honor and privilege I can't believe I'm getting to do this, and it so feels like me," Robinson said. "After you feel the call, there is always a measure of doubt in your mind - is God really calling me to this or am I just making mischief with my own mind - and this just feels so right, as hard as it is."  Robinson makes no apologies for his sexuality, or his decision to seek election as bishop. He declares that he is eager to marry his male partner, and will do so if such marriages ever become legal in New Hampshire. He allowed a camera crew from "60 Minutes" to film him talking about the church inside a New York City gay bar. He plans to bring his partner to a meeting of Episcopal bishops and their spouses. And next Saturday, he will attend the 11th annual Men's Event of Boston's Fenway Community Health Center -- a fund-raiser that is one of the biggest events on Boston's gay male social calendar -- to accept the Congressman Gerry E. Studds Visibility Award...."     I can't see ANY Christian symbols on his regalia, which is perhaps appropriate. I wish it were just a joke, and a sick joke at that. But it's not - it's for real. Glad to hear that he is having fun while his Church collapses. You would think that a Christian would be concerned of the pain his actions have caused.

      I've recently developed a taste for a particular genre of ancient Chinese music that's called 南管 (Nanguan in pinyin romanisation) - the Hokkiens/Fukienese call it Namkwan or Lamkwan (depending on which bit of the province they're from). It's also sometimes called 南音 Nanyin.   An interesting article on it:  urlLink Ancient Music Applies For World Intangible Heritage.   The lyrics are Tang Dynasty poems, over a thousand years old, and the music itself is only found in China's Fukien province and Taiwan, and among literati Hokkiens/Fukienese in the diaspora. It's very old art music, and was only ever played in the houses and courts of the intellectuals and highly cultured, so if you're Hokkien and you've never heard of it, you're probably not of exalted enough descent. The music itself is very curious, the style is very different from what we usually think of as Chinese Classical music - it's for voices, pipa-lute （琵琶） played horizontally like a lute/guitar (the way Tang musicians are depicted in paintings and how the Japanese still play their Biwa) instead of the modern vertical position, hsiao/xiao vertical flute （箫） and a few more plucked instruments.   The stuff that one hears in modern Chinese orchestras is heavily bastardised, with Mongol and Manchu influences - let's not even bring in the matter of cellos in them. This stuff sounds and feels very old - it's supposed to be as pure as we can get in a line of descent from the music that was once played in the Tang dynasty courts and before. A brief introduction to the music may be found  urlLink here .   From  urlLink a page on other stuff , a short intro to Nanguan:  Nanguan  literally called “Southern Pipes.”  It is a regional musical genre originated in the Quanzhou and Amoy areas in southern part of Fujian province in southeastern coastal China.  It is an instrumental and vocal ensemble traditionally performed by the literati class.  Nanguan musicians form clubs, such clubs are often associated with temples, which provide them with a place for rehearsal in exchange for their services during temple festivals.  The occasions of Nanguan performances include regular rehearsals, the spring and autumn ritual commemorating the patron god and deceased master teachers, the religious celebration at temple festivals, the rite of passage of fellow members of the clubs.       The repertory of Nanguan consists of three categories: 1. The sixteen instrumental suites ( known as Pu, 普), 2. The 48 song suites  (zhi, 纸),3. the numerous individual songs (qu, 曲).  Most of the instrumental suites have programmatic titles, depicting flowers, animals, or scenery.  The song suites and the individual songs have narrative or lyrical song texts which are based on historical stories that have been popular in the southern Fujian province for centuries.  A song suite consists of two to seven songs which, in most cases, share the same story.       A Nanguan ensemble usually consists of five instruments.  The pipa 琵琶, a four stringed plucked lute, plays the melody (known as gu, 骨 the bone) as given in the notation and functions as the conductor of the whole ensemble.  The sanxian 三线, a three-stringed plucked lute, supports the pipa by doubling the pipa melody one octave below, although in rare cases it may add some ornamentations.  The xiao 箫, a vertical end-blown flute, elaborates the pipa melody by adding ornamentation (known as rou 肉, the meat).  The erxian  二线, a two-stringed bowed lute, also adds ornamentation, in its own idiomatic way, to the pipa melody and is considered subsidiary to the flute.  Finally, the paiban  拍板, the five-slab wooden clapper, punctuates the meter.  When singing is involved, the singer plays the clapper and sings the ornamented melody in a manner similar to that of the flute and the bowed lute.”

      From the  urlLink Spectator :    Dear Mary...  Q. I find that I can’t remember somebody’s name for longer than 30 seconds after I have been introduced to them. It is worse at a party where I recognise people’s faces and suspect I know them well, but cannot remember who they are. Recently, at a fashion party, there was a typical worst-case scenario when I saw an old friend from university who now moves in fashion circles, and his name completely eclipsed [sic] me. Can you recommend a foolproof procedure that will work every time to prevent me from having these problems? I do not want to have to go on a five-day memory improvement course. S.G., London W8    A. In junior circles such as your own the mobile telephone provides an instant solution to this problem. Have it to hand as you go round parties, then, when you see a beaming stranger approaching, you are poised to present him with the device crying, ‘I’m glad I’ve seen you while I’ve got this in my hand. Would you mind entering your new details?’ In the pretence of admiring his dexterity, stand over him as he keys in his name.    A BRILLIANT IDEA!  Next, also from the Spectator:   A QUANTUM LEAP     Stephen Pettitt  says that rock musicians who compose classical music are out of their depth   A couple of weeks ago a press release arrived in my electronic in-tray. It was from Naxos, the record company much admired for its bargain recordings of a repertoire ranging wide and free over the thousand years or so of what we on my side of the business like to call Western art music. Naxos makes them cheap and turns in a profit by taking a chance on artists who might not have reached glamour status. Thus the company feeds on a thirst for repertoire, not on the cult of celebrity.  Or at least that has been the case until now. The email I received angled for me to provide gushing coverage of a new, prestigious release, a recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, no less, of a newly composed orchestral suite. What could be wrong with that? The championing of contemporary music by such a label — and it has already done good work in this department, not least by commissioning a whole series of string quartets from Sir Peter Maxwell Davies — is surely something very noble and desirable. The problem was that the composer of this suite, which is called Seven on the basis that it consists of seven movements, is one Tony Banks. Not the affable Labour MP, but, the bumf tells me, ‘keyboard player and composer for the progressive rock group Genesis’.  Alarm-bells rang, and I’m ashamed to say that I responded to the email with a thoroughly prejudiced and uncharacteristically rude ‘Oh, God’ even before I’d heard a note of the work. When the product arrived, however, all my prejudices proved justified. Seven is nothing more than musical doodling. While it has some sweet ideas, its language is severely restricted. It doesn’t challenge, move, or inspire. It’s rather like the work of someone who has taken early retirement from a boring office job and has taken instead to painting naff watercolours of idyllic lakeside scenes and pretty thatched cottages. Therapy for the creator, maybe, but dull for any reasonably intelligent beholder.  What’s more, as is common in such enterprises, in order to realise the piece for orchestra, Banks was obliged to engage the services of an orchestrator, one Simon Hale. Hale has achieved what any orchestrator should achieve: a professional if unremarkable job. But these days orchestration is an integral part of the creative process, not something slapped on to the music afterwards. It’s as if Banks had left the colouring-in of his naff watercolours to someone else.  Of course, anyone — even the odd critic — is perfectly entitled to compose music if he or she feels so moved. My objection is not that Banks has done so but that we are being sold the line that his reputation as a famous rock musician is enough to guarantee that he can be a classical composer of interest and ability. It’s not true of Banks. It was not true, either, of McCartney with his Liverpool Oratorio (likewise orchestrated by another hand). It’s not true even of the more sophisticated Elvis Costello, whose offerings with the Brodsky Quartet I have always found insipid and pretentious. I’m not sure what Banks’s business arrangement with Naxos is, but he was able to use the LPO, even engaging them for a second set of sessions (who paid?) because, unused to the way orchestras work in the studio and on his own admission, he was inadequately prepared for the first.  Everything about this product suggests that Naxos is not as idealistic an enterprise as we first thought. It’s not alone. Projects like EMI Classics’s dreadful Queen Symphony, a tiresome sequence of cheap Hollywood-style epic climaxes, or more recently Sanctuary Classics’s bland crossover effort, Patrick Hawes’s Blue in Blue, betray a willingness to compromise standards for profit that goes far beyond the populist ethos of Your Hundred Best Tunes. At least they were all good tunes.  Perhaps the most worrying aspect of the rock-musician-turned-classical-composer phenomenon is that it underlines the tendency nowadays to ignore the vast skills gap that exists between classical and pop/rock musicians, whether composers or players. I am not suggesting that people like Eric Clapton or Elton John are unskilled. Clearly they are not. But where many a classical musician could ape their achievements, is the reverse also true? Can John play the Hammerklavier? Would Clapton get his fingers around a Bach lute suite? For the record companies, however, the rule seems to be that if you are famous enough then you are good enough.  For a would-be composer desiring to cross the great divide, the chasm between the two art forms is perhaps even wider. Consider what the genre of the pop song generally demands of its creator. At best it can approach the outwardly simple lyric subtlety of Schubert. But mostly as music it is pretty crude. No organic exploration (Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner), collisions of musical types (Monteverdi, Messiaen), or complex layerings (Bruckner, Stravinsky, Carter). No dynamic shading, since everything is loud. No subtle instrumentation. An insistent tribal drum thud. Limited harmonies. Normally, a rigid four beats to a bar, and an equally rigid tempo, defined in bpms (beats per minute). It’s most often a music about pulse and power. Even in progressive rock, the spirit of musical adventure is severely restricted. Which is right, for its language suits its purpose.  Given a rooting in a craft so formulaic, is it any wonder that a rock musician wanting to compose something more substantial, more classical, should find himself at sea? A quantum leap is demanded of him. Yet the message we are being given is that we must laud him, that we must accept that his music can hold its own alongside the wonders of Monteverdi, Beethoven, Sibelius, Birtwistle. It’s just snobbishness if we do not.  Well, if snobbishness it is, a snob I will have to remain, for I find presumptuous this staking a claim on the territory of art music. Few rock stars know much about the commitment and skills that it takes to be a real musician, about the tedious hours spent practising each day, about the requirement to stand back and ruthlessly self-criticise, about the demands of getting inside a piece of real music. Few would tolerate the insecurity of an orchestral musician’s working environment, or know just how much courage it takes to mount the stage night after night and do the physically impossible. Few can contemplate the agonies that a composer puts himself or herself through in order to find the inner voice, the language, the form, the right sound for the moment. By all means allow the rock stars their indulgences, particularly if one consequence is that some of their wealth finds its way into real musicians’ pockets. But please do not try to sell it as something that it is not. Not to me, anyway.

      Not much, but whenever Lucretius makes it into the press, it must be noteworthy. This time, he's mentioned by an MP/Editor of the Spectator (writing a column for the  urlLink Telegraph ) who seems to have the Life of Brian and Passion inextricably bound together in his noggin:       I could defend myself by saying that a spot of laughter never did any religion any harm. Look at the evil maniacs at work in Iraq: if only they'd lighten up, hundreds of people would not be dead this morning in Karbala. I suppose I could quote the great materialist and Epicurean Lucretius to the effect that  tantum religio potuit suadere malorum .

      From  urlLink rogueclassicism :  Interesting rumours flitting about that Mel Gibson intends to (or it is being suggested to him or something) make a movie about the heroism of ancient Jews, apparently to 'prove' he isn't anti-semitic. From the  Orlando Sentinel :       The first rumor flitting through the evangelical world is that the filmmaker intends to plow the profits from The Passion into a movie about the central characters of the holiday of Hanukkah, fighters called the Maccabees. Their story is told in sacred writings of the biblical period, although the two books of the same name are not officially a part of either testament.      Nearly 200 years before Jesus' birth, religious Jews in the land of Israel rose in violent rebellion against pagan occupiers and their Jewish allies.      A political heir of Alexander the Great, the Syrian Greek emperor Antiochus Epiphanes, tried to impose a single faith and culture throughout his Middle Eastern realm. For Jewish subjects, that meant they could no longer practice their faith. Antiochus banned Sabbath observance and circumcision -- on pain of death.      The Maccabean uprising was sparked when a government official compelled a Jew to offer a pagan sacrifice. This sacrilegious act enraged a pious man named Mattathias, who killed the collaborator and the official with his sword, and then shouted to the crowd: "Whoever is for the Lord, follow me!"      Mattathias led his five sons and their followers into the hills, from which they launched a protracted guerrilla war, led by his son Judah, a brilliant military tactician. Bloody battles and torture ensued, as the outnumbered believers wore down their enemies, some of whom rode into the fray on armored elephants.      In the end, after Mattathias died and several of his sons were killed in battle, the orthodox Jewish believers triumphed and the temple in Jerusalem was cleansed and restored to holiness. According to tradition, a remnant of sanctified oil in the temple lamp miraculously burned for eight days, until more could be found.      For Gibson, there are several advantages, apart from a familiar scenario. Having succeeded with subtitles, it should be easy to shift from The Passion's Aramaic and Latin to the earlier period's Hebrew and Greek.      Also, since the Maccabee story takes place only 200 years before The Passion, and peasant fashions probably didn't change much in those days, he could conceivably use many of the same costumes.      A suggested pursuit      Last week, the American-born Israeli educator Yossi Katz suggested that Gibson's next film should be a dramatization of the Bar Kochba Revolt of A.D. 132-135. This rebellion took place a century after Jesus' death, and 60 years after a failed uprising against the Roman occupation that led to half a million Jewish deaths and the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem.      Writing in a column syndicated to Jewish weekly newspapers, Katz recalled that the Roman emperor Hadrian -- like Antiochus Epiphanes before him -- tried to impose paganism on the Jews at sword's point. This time, the revolt was led by a sage named Rabbi Akiba and a younger military protégé, Simon Bar Kochba.      Chafing under oppressive Roman rule, the Jews plotted their revolt for three years. Slaves working in the armories deliberately nicked swords, knowing they would be rejected for use by the Romans. Later, the discarded weapons would be collected and hidden. Miles of underground tunnels and subterranean redoubts were built, Katz wrote, in preparation for the uprising.      At first, the rebellion was a success, with Bar Kochba's army decimating an entire Roman legion. But after 31/2 years, the rebellion was crushed, and the Jewish general was killed in battle. Roman historians estimated that 600,000 Jews died in the revolt.      Ten leading rabbis were captured and executed in the Roman theater in Caesarea. Akiba was tortured and flayed to death with hot metal combs, much like the scourging of Jesus in The Passion and the execution of William Wallace in Braveheart.      Of course, even a sympathetic portrayal of Jewish heroes might not assuage all of Gibson's critics.      Abraham Foxman, executive director of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation League, predicts that if Gibson dramatizes either Jewish rebellion, "we'll lose."      "He'll write his own history," Foxman says. "I would prefer to leave the fate of Jewish history and Hollywood to Steven Spielberg. The Maccabees and Bar Kochba are our sacred history.      "The way he treats history -- with a cherry picker of that which fits his ideology or view -- is not the way I would like the world to learn about the heroism of the Maccabees or Bar Kochba. So, thanks but no thanks." [ urlLink the whole thing ]

      From  urlLink rougeclassicism :    A week or so ago I wondered about historical advisors for The Passion ... this is the closest I've come so far (from the Chicago Tribune):      The task of achieving linguistic authenticity fell to Rev. William Fulco, a Jesuit priest and professor of ancient Mediterranean studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Gibson got Fulco's name from Yale University, where Fulco received a doctorate and taught Aramaic.      "I got a call while I was in Jerusalem: `Hey, Padre, It's Mel, I got a job for you,'" Fulco said. "I said, `Mel who?' We talked for about an hour. He told me about the project, and I couldn't pass it up."      In 2002, Gibson gave Fulco the script written by Benedict Fitzgerald, mostly derived from the Gospels, and asked Fulco to translate it into Aramaic , Hebrew and Latin. Fulco later translated the script back into English subtitles.      The use of multiple languages in the film reflects the linguistic diversity of Palestine during Jesus' life. Most people spoke Aramaic, which the Jews adopted while exiled in Babylon in the 6th Century before Jesus' birth. Hebrew, their language before the exile, was retained in religious writings and liturgy (and is spoken by Jesus in prayer in "The Passion"). Latin was spoken by the Roman soldiers occupying the region. Greek was spoken throughout the Roman Empire, thanks to Alexander the Great, but was seen as a sign of secularization and thus resisted by many Jews.      Fulco left Greek out of "The Passion," substituting Latin in occasional cases where Greek might have been used. He also made mostly imperceptible distinctions between the elegant Latin of Pilate and the crude Latin of soldiers, thanks to an X-rated source he found on his shelf.      "I tracked down some obscene graffiti from Roman army camps," Fulco said. "Somebody who knows Latin really well, their ears will fall off. We didn't subtitle those words."      Fulco even confessed to some linguistic mischief.      "Here and there I put in playful things which nobody will know. There's one scene where Caiaphas turns to his cohorts and says something in Aramaic. The subtitle says, `You take care of it.' He's actually saying, `Take care of my laundry.'"      Other linguistic tricks of Fulco's serve a function in the script.      For example, he incorporated deliberate dialogue errors in the scenes where the Roman soldiers, speaking Aramaic, are shouting to Jewish crowds, who respond in Latin. To illustrate the groups' inability to communicate with each other, each side speaks with incorrect pronunciations and word endings.      Later, "there's an exchange where Pilate addresses Jesus in Aramaic, and Jesus answers in Latin. It's kind of a nifty little symbolic thing: Jesus is going to beat him at his own game," Fulco said. "One line [in that exchange] I kind of enjoyed is when Jesus says, `My power is given from above, otherwise my followers would not have allowed this.' That's [spoken in] the pluperfect subjunctive."      Appreciating the niceties      It takes a linguist to appreciate that grammatical nicety as remarkable for being uttered by a Palestinian Jew who mostly spoke Aramaic and Greek.      For the relatively few Middle Eastern Christians who still speak Aramaic, "The Passion" may sound riddled with mistakes -- spurring Fulco to point out, "modern Aramaic dialects are as different [from ancient ones] as Chaucer and modern English."      Still, now that the movie is in general release, Fulco fully expects to get an earful about his use of languages.      "We linguists are a crazy bunch," he said. "The more obscure the language, the more people try to prove their territory worthwhile and say, by God, we're going to sniff out errors."  [ urlLink the whole thing ]

      At dinner tonight, I found a new pair of chopsticks on the chopstick-rest at my place at the table. I'd hitherto been using a ivory pair about 6" long, yellow and discoloured with age, as they were used by my mother during her childhood in pre-communist Shanghai. Mum said they were a child's chopsticks and I was long overdue for a pair of adult ones, so she took a new pair from the little stash of antique (but never used) ivory ones. Thing is, I realised I now had the longest pair of chopsticks in use at home. I objected, saying that Dad should be using the longest pair (indicating the most important and most senior person in the household). After all, the only chopsticks permitted to be longer than Dad's should be the guest chopsticks. Mum and Dad both insisted that since I have the largest pair of hands in the house, I should use them. I guess that's their way of telling me certain things that are difficult to put in words. I'm an adult now, I have to remember that.

      Hello from Peking!  Flight was twenty past midnight, 3/4 full (though it was more than made up for by the shopping of the chinese tourists returning to the Mainland).   Weather was 29 yesterday, but today it's dropped back to 10. Half of Peking is down with the cold. We got picked up at the airport by our chairman, as his wife's down with the cold and so is the driver.   China's fascinating, one sees changes with every trip. Much of the general population could do with a good wash and grooming, but there are a few devastatingly goodlooking specimens here and there.   Oh Lordy I'm in the same room as dad for the next 10 days. I'm going to have to take time off to myself every 2 days or so, otherwise I'll either go mad or strangle him.   I mentioned earlier that Blogspot is blocked in China. It's  urlLink STILL blocked .   We're staying in Tongzhou Binguan - Tongzhou Hotel (more like a resthouse), a Govt run thing that's slightly dodgy but acceptable. It's cheaper for our guys in Peking to put us up there. The chaps behind the counter have never seen anyone who's not from hongkong, korea or china before, and were amazed at the sturdiness and thickness of singaporean passports. They spent some ten minutes scrutinising our passports - they hadn't realised Singaporeans no longer need visas to go to China.   Food's excellent. Lunch in our hotel restaurant - Eggplants stir fried with beef slices; green soybeans stir fried with mustard greens; potato shreds stirfried with oil and vinegar - lots of rice.  Ah, China. I'm typing this from a terminal in our company's Satellite Hub, in case you were wondering. I just got my business cards today - they say "Edward Yong - International Business Development". HA. That's a good one.   by the way, just because blogspot's blocked and I can't view my blog or comments or tagboard doesn't mean you can all be naughty and put wicked comments there!

      from  urlLink Mirabilis :  urlLink  Researcher Hopes to Find "Secret of Life" with Monks’ Lifestyle        Variety is the spice of life, or so the saying goes, but now a University of Missouri-Columbia researcher believes the true secret of living a long, healthy and satisfying life might be at a nearby monastery.      "Through a systematic review of the scientific literature, we found that individuals who regularly participate in organized religious activities live longer and healthier lives on average," said Daniel Longo, MU professor of family and community medicine. "This effect may be more significant among those who have made a life-long commitment to a religious lifestyle in an organized religious community. For example, a Dutch study found that Trappist and Benedictine monks between 1900 and 1994 experienced a 12 percent lower mortality rate than the general population of Dutch men."      Based on that information, it is likely that monks who live by The Rule of St. Benedict, which includes both Benedictines and Trappist monks, might provide the key to a lifestyle that has numerous benefits to the public, Longo said. Because so many lay people are following The Rule, it’s likely the benefits could be far-reaching outside of the monastery. While in existence for more than 1,000 years, the religious movement of following the Rule of St. Benedict as an "oblate," or a layperson affiliated with a monastery, has grown tremendously during the past several decades. A recent study finds that lay oblates outnumber monks 3 to 1.      The Rule of St. Benedict encourages people to live a life of moderation, obedience, humility and respect for their fellow person. It is focused on a balanced life and provides individuals with guidelines for spirituality that also include behaviors and attitudes conducive to good health. Longo has analyzed The Rule and found more than 50 different references to health, health behaviors, hygiene and a balanced life. Longo presented his findings at the 50th Anniversary Symposium of the Monastic Institute in Rome.   urlLink [continue]

      Today is the 89th Anniversary of the first genocide of the last century - the Armenian Holocaust.   "Adolf Hitler, while persuading his associates that a Jewish holocaust would be tolerated by the west stated... 'Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'"  May his words be false. Let us pray for all hurt by the Genocide and REMEMBER in hopes of not allowing this to repeat or happen to other people.  The French National Assembly has formally recognized as genocide the slaughter of a million and a half Armenians living in the Ottoman empire between 1915 and 1917. Other Declarations of Recognition have come from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Kurdistan, Lebanon, Russia, Sweden, Uruguay and the Vatican. Due to continued political pressure from Turkey which has threatened economic and military sanctions against all who recognize the Genocide, the United States of America -a NATO ALLY- has yet to officially recognize it.   A good resource for learning more about the Armenian Holocaust is  urlLink cilicia.com   Enver Pasha, one of the triumvirate rulers publicly declared on 19 May 1916,  "The Ottoman Empire should be cleaned up of the Armenians and the Lebanese. We have destroyed the former by the sword, we shall destroy the latter through starvation."   Talat Pasha, in a conversation with Dr. Mordtmann of the German Embassy in June 1915,  "Turkey is taking advantage of the war in order to thoroughly liquidate (grundlich aufzaumen) its internal foes, i.e., the indigenous Christians, without being thereby disturbed by foreign intervention."   After the German Ambassador persistently brought up the Armenian question in 1918, Talat said with a smile,  "What on earth do you want? The question is settled. There are no more Armenians."

      Americans use "Mr." and Brits use "Mr" - what's the difference?  Most Singaporeans can't grasp the difference, so here's your chance to learn something.   There are  abbreviations , where the last letter of the abbreviation is not the last letter of the unabbreviated word. There, the full stop indicates " there's actually more letters after this ":   Professor -> Prof.  Opus -> Op. Chapter -> Chap. From -> Fr.   And there are  contractions , where the last letter of the contracted form is the last letter of the uncontracted word (and hence no full stop is required):  Saint -> St Road -> Rd Mister -> Mr Block -> Blk Father -> Fr  In English usage, abbreviations take a full stop but not contractions.  In American usage, both take full stops.   Anglophile that I am, I prefer the English usage - it's grammatically clearer. However, I wish writers would simply be consistent and stick with one or the other and not mix usages - it's highly annoying.

      Doc today at the allergy centre says he thinks I have Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria. In other words, the hives that appear seem to have no immediate cause, and it's just my immune system playing tricks on me. Being on Prednisolone, a steroid, on a tailing dose of 30 to 5 mg over 3 months hasn't been kind to me... I've gained ten kilogrammes, had skin breakouts all over, and had horrid mood swings. To put it another way, I've been a spotty, grumpy, WHALE.   So now I'm on Telfast (Fexofenadine hydrochloride), another antihistamine, this time at 120mg daily for now. Let's see if it works.   Doc said if this doesn't work, he'll have to put me on something stronger. I asked "such as Cyclosporin?", and he went "oh! You've heard of it?". I said "oh, I read widely". He explained that it was rather strong a medication and he'd rather not put me on it as a first course of action, and I added "plus it's not cheap either" and he went again "oh, you know!". I once again replied, "I read" and grinned.   Dad has been hoping it's the blue hair dye that I'm allergic to. Doc says absolutely not. Dad's a tad annoyed, as this means he hasn't an excuse to get me to stop colouring my hair. Ha!  I really hope this works for my hives - they're REALLY annoying.

      From  urlLink mirabilis.ca :   Two mystery men dressed as Batman and Robin have been fighting crime and saving damsels in distress in a small English town.  The pair have been spotted springing into action a number of times in recent weeks on the streets of Whitley, near Reading.  The Reading Evening Post asked readers for news of the duo after they dealt with a pair of streakers at a local football cup final.  And the newspaper was besieged with calls from residents who claimed to have seen the 'superheroes' in action.  Michelle Kirby was stranded when her Peugeot 206 ran out of petrol on Easter Sunday - until Batman and Robin appeared out of nowhere and pushed her car to the nearest petrol station.  She said: "They just appeared. I saw them running down the road in Batman and Robin outfits - I was laughing so much.  "It was like a scene out of Only Fools and Horses and they stayed in character the whole time.  "They said, "I'm Batman, I'm Robin" and I said, "No, you're not" and asked them if they were going to a fancy dress party but they said they were going back to Gotham City."

      Soundtrack: "No More 'I Love You's" by Annie Lennox.   That men of a certain type should behave as they do is inevitable. To wish it otherwise were to wish the fig-tree would not yield its juice. In any case, remember that in a very little while both you and he will be dead, and your very name will quickly be forgotten.  Put from you the belief that 'I have been wronged', and with it will go the feeling. Reject your sense of injury, and the injury itself disappears.   (begin rant)  Wretch thou art. A thrice-wretched ingrate. How I would have loved thee, this thou knowest. Didst thou lack for anything whilst under my wings and in my love thou sheltered? Unto the ends of the earth I would have walked and shed every drop of my blood - solely for love of thee.   (end rant)

      "Who remembers the Armenians?" said Hitler to encourage his officers in the work of exterminating the Jews.   Today I watched Atom Egoyan's  urlLink Ararat  - a very meditative film that interweaves the story of the Armenian Genocide with various subplots here and there. I'm not sure it's entirely successful as a film, but it deals with a worthy subject that most people haven't a clue about.   For those who aren't aware, the Turkish government systematically murdered the ancient native Christian populations of Anatolia in Asia Minor during the years 1890-1930, soaking the land red with the blood of  urlLink Greeks , Syrians and Armenians. I'll save most of the information for later as we get closer to 24th April, which is Armenian Genocide Day. In a nutshell, some 3 million Christians were murdered by the Turks in those years - a Christian Holocaust. Here's a  urlLink website  and a  urlLink fact sheet  on this.   Amazingly enough, the Turkish government continues to deny  to this day  that it ever happened.   One day, when my Armenian's good enough, I shall learn how to sing the Armenian service for the departed. Thus when I visit Turkey again, and visit the places where the the Armenians and othe Christians were martyred, I shall be able to sing the appropriate prayers for their repose.   Who remembers the Armenians? I do.  MEMORY ETERNAL!

      Spent the morning and lunch in a meeting with the architects of our Tower of Babel (my nickname for it) project in Peking, slated to be the world's tallest building, a golden spike some one kilometre tall. Then spent the afternoon at Dominic's place - Teeheong has come back from 6 years in Melbourne, where he's been playing Bassoon and doing postgrad, and is very annoyed with the immigration laws about foreign talent - he's easily the best bassonist in Australia and he can't get a position because he doesn't have PR (and conversely he can't get PR unless he has a regular job). I've not seen him in 6 years, so it was lovely catching up again.   Next, the National University of Singapore's decided to can the Piper's Guild - seems we're not making enough money. The same university that's annouced extra funding for the arts and built a spanking new Arts Centre that cost millions... cuts back on fledgling groups. Brilliant. Never mind, we did fine for over a decade before we went under the University's wing, and we'll be fine without them - just without the thousands of dollars each term to spend on instruments and a room to call our own.   Dom and I had dinner at Adam Road - briyani... yum. Rented Gattaca to watch - I'm surprised I hadn't watched it before. It's excellent - the soundtrack by Michael Nyman is to die for... and Ethan Hawke is adorably handsome in there ;)

      So we had a power outage last night. I actually enjoyed it - no computer distracting me, no TV for dad to turn up at high volume and thus driving me nuts... only the lack of airconditioning or fans and not being able to charge my mobile phone was a tad annoying.   When keeping a blog, how far does one self-censor? It's far easier keeping a diary, wherein all of one's most personal and honest thoughts may be recorded, because there at least one may have some measure of control over the readership. A blog however, is vastly different - one never quite knows who might be reading. Some things simply aren't said in public, and to the faces of certain people.

Do they think we don't know Jesus Christ? Let them go to the Muslim areas and distribute their Bibles. If they do it in Muslim neighborhoods, the Muslims will kill them."

      From  urlLink Serge's Blog :  urlLink   Endangered Languages Project  : Theres  urlLink a facinating article  (registration required) from the Philadelphia Enquirer about language conservationists who record endangered languages, and Serge, like me, is a language geek. It's quite fascinating, as the article says:   About 500 years ago, humans spoke 13,000 languages. Today, only about 6,500 languages remain. In a few centuries, there could be as few as 500.  That alarms linguists, who are scurrying to record languages and describe their grammar before they are lost for good.  "If we let them go extinct, valuable knowledge will be lost," Harrison said. "Many preliterate cultures have immense knowledge, which they hand down by way of their language."  Tofa, another Siberian language that Harrison has studied, provides an example. He said Tofa-speaking reindeer herders have devised a highly efficient way of sharing information about their herds. They have an individual word for every conceivable combination of attributes to describe a reindeer. Using just a single word, a Tofa speaker could describe, say, a 2-year-old, brown, castrated male reindeer.  Languages also impart something else, less tangible. They reflect different perspectives on life and the physical world.  The English words snake and fish indicate no perceived connection between these living things. But in Tofa, the word for snake is translated as ground-fish. An interesting choice - it helps an English speaker see the similarity between how a fish moves in water and the slithering of a snake over land.    urlLink   The Abolition of Grandparents:   by Gary North  Because there was so little housing space under Communism, it was common for grandparents to live in the same small apartment. So, when the children came home from school, grandma was there to tell them stories and thereby transfer part of the pre-revolution culture to them.  -snip snip-  My father-in-law was alert to this factor because he was an Armenian. He was the seventh in a line of sons in his family who served the community as their minister. There was never any other occupation that his father had wanted for him. Until the Turkish genocide of a million Armenians in 1915–16, his family had stayed in the same town: Van. He told me that it was possible to trace his family back to the 13th century in the church graveyard. In the church Bible that had been left behind in the exodus in 1915, his father had told him that there was a notation in the margin: "Today, the Mongols came through." That is what I would call cultural continuity.  WOW. Talk about continuity.

      Some comments from the  urlLink Scotsman  about the decline of Latin, here's what they say about the Catholic Church:   The international institution that formerly sustained Latin - the Catholic Church - has largely sold out that great intellectual heritage. In 1962, at the first session of the Second Vatican Catastrophe, the American bishops complained that they could not understand the debates being conducted in Latin. So they installed, at their own expense, simultaneous translation facilities. Instead, they should each have been handed a copy of North and Hillard and been told to come back when they had attained the level of literacy appropriate to any bishop of the Holy Roman Church.

      from  urlLink Rogueclassicism :   On  urlLink Passion :      Last night, however, the wife and I went and it was a pretty good movie. Not great -- if Zefirelli and Mel got together and made the movie, it would be great.  Now since no one in the popular press seems to comment on the Latin -- other than to mention how it probably wasn't historically the language which would have been spoken by the various folks who speak it -- I will. It's not as bad as some folks have suggested. Some of the pronunciation is ecclesiastical, which is kind of strange in context ("Chaisar"?). I did detect (imagine?) that the common soldier types were using a more 'English' word order than Pontius Pilate, who was rather more 'Wheelockian'. Either way, though, it was generally understandable, once you caught on to the accents -- Jesus' Latin was somewhat difficult to understand, but that might have been deliberate, given that it wasn't his 'first' tongue. My only real quibble with the 'Latin' side of things was the way Caiaphas addressed Pilate. Most often, it was as "gubernator", which I don't believe would have been appropriate. Similiter, he once addresses him as "Consul", which also seems out of place. Only once does he address him as procurator. [update: a reader -- thanks RH! -- has reminded me that Pilate's official title was Praefectus;  in the Passion, he is never addressed as such as far as I recall] In passing, though, I note that Pilate seems to be portrayed as understanding various non-Latin languages. I'm not sure how accurate that would be ...  Some interesting bits of Latin that caught my ear were the soldier saying "Faciam musicam" (I shall make the music) prior to Jesus' scourging and the centurion's "Interfecimus deum" when the earthquake hits.     urlLink Bushiad and Idyossey   -  This was mentioned on the Classics list ... it's a parody (obviously) of Homer's works with George Bush as the central character in both. Clearly not written by a Republican ... Some folks will like it, others will hate it, but you've got to at least acknowledge the effort.     urlLink Classicolor  :   Okay ... a couple of folks have sent this to me and the first time I shuddered and thought ... no. But it keeps popping up in various fora, so we might as well get it over with. At the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Cophenhagen, there is an exhibition called "Classicolor", which presents copies of assorted Classical pieces painted as they would have been originally. Someone has put  urlLink a page of photos  up. Shudder redux. Not sure about the accuracy of the colours, but they're probably not too far ... they all seem to have Anime/Manga style eyes (especially the Caligula) ...    urlLink  More Thoughts on Scotland and Classics :   And an impassioned plea for the classics comes from Valerio Massimo Manfredi, Italian archaeologist and author of a trilogy of novels on Alexander the Great as well as The Last Legion, all of which have inspired and informed films currently in production.  "Let’s imagine that in 500 years’ time, or a thousand, English has become a dead language, replaced, perhaps, by Chinese. And let’s imagine that it is learned only in schools and universities, much as ancient Greek and Latin are now. At that point someone might claim that the study of English had become completely useless because it is a dead language and should be abolished in favour of other subjects, more functional and suitable to the times.  "In theory, this wouldn’t mean much; in practice it would be a disaster. No-one would be able to read Chaucer,Shakespeare, Milton, Blake, Dickens, Joyce, etc, any longer.  "This is why it would be a serious mistake to close the last institutions which cultivate the study of these so-called ‘dead’ languages."  We neglect Latin and Greek at our peril, warns Manfredi, who goes so far as to point to Ray Bradbury’s novel Fahrenheit 451 - about a future society that bans books. Greek and Latin, he argues, like music, poetry and art, are "vaccines against homogenisation, globalisation … the subjugation of minds."  The full original article  urlLink here .

Yuck!" or "Who needs them? I don't read!". Who'd have thought anyone would consider illiteracy a badge of distinction? Ah yes, but then I live in Singapore, an island with less culture than a pot of yoghurt, and where the vast majority of citizens are dumb illiterate cattle without the capacity to think and reason, without common sense, without manners or any graces at all.   Here endeth today's rant.

      Remember a week ago I  urlLink blogged  about NATO forces in Kosovo attacking an Orthodox Priest and his son, leaving both in a coma?    urlLink Here's an account  from the Priest's wife and pictures.   SHAME on Nato. Shame on those who demonise Serbs in this conflict and support the Albanian terrorists who destroy our churches and work for the destruction of Christendom. The Western media has demonised Serbia in the last decade or more, while virtually ignoring the fact that Bosnia-Hercegovina's first president Alija Izetbegovic spoke of creating a pure Islamic state in the region prior to independence, brought in fundamentalist Moslem guerillas who carried out anti-Christian pogroms against both Orthodox and Catholics in several areas, and of course he provided his buddy Osama Bin Laden with a Bosnian passport.  Sadly, where the Serbs were considered the villains in Bosnia-Hercegovina, they are now viewed similarly in Kosovo by many Western governments.  Meanwhile in Egypt,  urlLink Coptic Pope Denounces Forced Conversion Of Coptic Girls  In case you didn't know, the Christians of Egypt trace their lineage back to St Mark the Evangelist, and have been relentlessly persecuted by the Mahometans since Egypt was so cruelly wrested from the Christian Roman Empire, of which it was a part, in the 7th Century by the invading Arabs, who enforced their religion and decimated the Church. Fierce persecution has been the lot of the Egyptian Church, and it's a wonder they're still going after over a thousand years of oppression, murder, forced conversions and rapine. For more information, visit  urlLink www.copts.com     Again we pray for the suffering peoples of Kosovo, Egypt and Palestine, that the Lord our God would hear their cry and deliver them from their great distress: hear us, O Almighty Lord, and have mercy!  Again we pray that the Lord would turn aside all evil intentions and malice directed against His faithful people, preserving and sustaining them in the midst of enmity and cruel violence: hear us, O gracious Lord, and have mercy!  Again we pray that the Lord will stop the hand of those raised up against His Holy Church, softening the hearts of our enemies: hear us, O most merciful Lord, and have mercy!  Again we pray that the Lord would confirm His persecuted people in Christian witness, granting them the grace to bear their sufferings in His Holy Name and to His glory: hear us, O most holy Lord, and have mercy!

      now that Pascha and Holy Week are out of the way, I can go back to regular blogging again! Expect the usual updates and articles once more!  Oh, and now that Pascha's over, I can eat anything I want for the next 50 days! Mua ha ha ha ha!   Amusingly enough, my chanting in various languages over Holy Week and Pascha scored lots of points with the 'ethnic' Orthodox. *GRIN*  Now, a small selection of articles:   urlLink The Real Battle over The Passion  - the REAL reason why those Jews hate the film.    urlLink In Praise of Cowardice  - why the French are right and the Americans should learn from them.    urlLink Vengeance  - Something liberal 'modern' Americans won't ever understand - the culture of honour and revenge, and why America's making a mess of Iraq and the Middle East.    urlLink Church and State: The New Anti-Catholicism  - an interesting article on how the separation of Church and State usually ends up with the State trying to swallow up the Church.

          Christ is risen from the dead, trampling down death by death, and upon those in the tombs bestowing life!   (Troparion)   Greetings to all on the radiant feast of the Resurrection. If you're wondering what the icon shows - it's what we traditionally call "the Harrowing of Hell". Christ, doing down into Hades, has broken the chains and gates of Hades (notice below Christ's feet), and pulls Adam and Eve out of the grave (other  urlLink icons  show him grabbing both Adam and Eve). In t urlLink his icon , showing the same thing, one notices the angels above Christ's head holding the banner of victory - the Cross. On either side, kings and prophets of the Old Testament look on in amazement.    I won't say anything of my own on the topic of the Resurrection, but will quote from the Paschal Homily of St John Chrysostom (the Golden-Mouthed), Archbishop of Constantinople. This sermon dates from about the year 400 A.D. and according to Tradition, the clergy of the Orthodox Church do not preach their own sermon on Easter, but rather read St John Chrysostom's excellent sermon. Here it is:   The Paschal homily of St John Chrysostom   If any be a devout lover of God,   let him partake with gladness from this fair and radiant feast. If any be a faithful servant,   let him enter rejoicing into the joy of his Lord. If any have wearied himself with fasting,   let him now enjoy his reward. If any have laboured from the first hour,   let him receive today his rightful due. If any have come after the third,   let him celebrate the feast with thankfulness. If any have come after the sixth,   let him not be in doubt, for he will suffer no loss. If any have delayed until the ninth,   let him not hesitate but draw near. If any have arrived only at the eleventh,   let him not be afraid because he comes so late.  For the Master is generous and accepts the last even as the first. He gives rest to him who comes at the eleventh hour   in the same was as him who has laboured from the first. He accepts the deed, and commends the intention.  Enter then, all of you, into the joy of our Lord. First and last, receive alike your reward. Rich and poor, dance together. You who fasted and you who have not fasted, rejoice together. The table is fully laden: let all enjoy it. The calf is fatted: let none go away hungry.  Let none lament his poverty;   for the universal Kingdom is revealed. Let none bewail his transgressions;   for the light of forgiveness has risen from the tomb. Let none fear death;   for death of the Saviour has set us free.  He has destroyed death by undergoing death. He has despoiled hell by descending into hell. He vexed it even as it tasted of His flesh. Isaiah foretold this when he cried: Hell was filled with bitterness when it met Thee face to face below;   filled with bitterness, for it was brought to nothing;   filled with bitterness, for it was mocked;   filled with bitterness, for it was overthrown;   filled with bitterness, for it was put in chains. Hell received a body, and encountered God. It received earth, and confronted heaven. O death, where is your sting? O hell, where is your victory?   Christ is risen!  And you, o death, are annihilated!  Christ is risen!  And the evil ones are cast down!  Christ is risen!  And the angels rejoice!  Christ is risen ! And life is liberated!  Christ is risen!  And the tomb is emptied of its dead; for Christ having risen from the dead, is become the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep.  To Him be Glory and Power, now and forever, and from all ages to all ages. Amen!

      So what's Great and Holy Saturday about? The Western Church knows all about Good Friday and who doesn't know what Easter is about? But yet, to most of the West, Great Saturday is a bit of a limbo period. Not quite Easter yet, but not quite out of Good Friday.   This is the day on which our salvation was effected. This is the day when the "gates of brass" of Hell were broken. This is the day Christ lay in the tomb - the day God himself rested, that's why it's Great and Holy Saturday. As the hymns for Great Saturday tell us:   He who shut in the depths is beheld dead, wrapped in fine linen and spices. The immortal One is laid in a tomb as a mortal man. The women have come to anoint Him with myrrh, weeping bitterly and crying: "This is the most blessed sabbath on which Christ has fallen asleep to rise on the third day.   Life itself is Great Saturday, to put it one way - we've gone through Great Friday, and we're waiting for the General Resurrection - for eternity, because Sunday and Pascha (Easter) is the eternal Eight Day.   I could use a good rest myself. I've been on my feet all week chanting for the local Chalcedonian Byzantine Orthodox (I know that's a curious way of describing them) parish - some 5 hours on Palm Sunday, then 2 hours on Great Monday and Great Tuesday, 4 hours on Great Wed and Great Thursday, then 5 on Great Friday.   It's been an exhausting week - not only does this parish lack a chanter, they don't have the music for Holy Week. While I have much of it, there are certain essential pieces I don't have, so I've ended up emailing chanters and clergy of various traditions and they've faxed and emailed me Galician, Russian and Greek music, which I've had to set English words to - great fun. I usually sing the stuff in English and also in the original language, whee.   I'm nowhere near being a trained chanter, but I have the benefit of having been soaked to the bone in Orthodox services, so I know how the services work, as well as music from various traditions (from being a dilettante and hanging around real chanters from various traditions). The result is that while I'm not drilled in any one tradition, I know enough music to bluff my way as a singer (tho not necessarily chanter) through any services that aren't in a single language or tradition.   The stuff that's in regular tones I can handle easily, but then there's the "special melody" stuff... and the ones I've had to learn from scratch for this week are (for those of you who are liturgical enthusiasts):   Behold the Bridegroom Cometh/Se Zhenyk Gryadet Polyunoshchi/  - for the first few services of Holy Week. First in English, according to the simple Russian Obikhod melody, then in Slavonic, according to the slightly more meandering (and thus more interesting) Galician melody.    Of Thy Mystical Supper/Vecheri Tvoyeya  - the hymn for Great Thursday. The English version I find best sung to the simple Russian Obikhod Tone 6 melody. Just for effect, at Communion time I threw in the Slavonic version, using the melody from the 1904 Lviv Irmologion.    Noble Joseph/Blagoobrazny Iosif  - for the Good Friday services, repeated ad infinitum during the veneration of the Epitaphios (grave cloth of Christ). The melody I used was the most complicated of the melody variants - the Russian one. The music was faxed to me the morning of the service, and I ended up fitting the English words to it, singing those as well as the Slavonic.    Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silent/Da Molchit Fsyakaya Plot  - replacing the Cherubic Hymn on Great Saturday for the Vesperal Liturgy of St Basil. The easiest thing to do for English is to use the words and melody (Picardy) found in any traditional western hymnal. During communion I decided to use the Slavonic version, to Galician chant from the 1904 Lviv Irmologion.    In The Flesh Thou Didst Fall Asleep/Plotiyu Usnuv  - for the Paschal Liturgy. I'm singing this tonight in English to the 1904 Lviv Irmologion melody - the other singers can hold an ison (drone) for this, I'm singing this solo because it's too difficult for anyone not musically trained to pick it up quickly.   After this morning's Vespers and Liturgy, I met Howard for lunch and we watched Passion together. 'twas his 18th birthday, and he chose to spend the afternoon with me, how sweet.   Comments on Passion? Beautifully made, visually stunning. Gibson has some truly breathtakingly inspired moments. On the other hand, certain inconsistencies with the Gospel accounts, as well as intentional historical inaccuracies marred the film for me. I won't bother posting the review now, but perhaps later in the week when I've caught my breath. Nevertheless, well done, Gibson. Amusingly enough, I find a priest I've known for many years is actually Gibson's chaplain - yes, in Gibson's little chapel in California, so I've asked him to send Gibson my little nitpicks.   I wish I were in Dublin with Fr Serge for Pascha this year- Andrij's there.

        Epitaphios in gold-thread embroidery, early 14th C., Thessaloniki, Museum of Byzantine Civilization   Today hell cries out groaning: I should not have accepted the Man born of Mary. He came and destroyed my power. He shattered the gates of brass. As God, He raised the souls that I had held captive. Glory to Thy cross and resurrection, O Lord.  Today, hell cries out groaning: My dominion has been shattered. I received a dead man as one of the dead, but against Him I could not prevail. From eternity I had ruled the dead, but behold, He raised all. Because of Him do I perish. Glory to Thy cross and resurrection, O Lord.  Today hell cries out groaning: My power has been trampled upon. The Shepherd is crucified and Adam is raised. I have been deprived of those whom I ruled. Those whom I swallowed in my strength I have given up. He Who was crucified has emptied the tombs. The power of death has been vanquished. Glory to Thy cross and resurrection, O Lord.

      I find myself stuck in Singapore this Holy Week, so I'm helping out the Oecumenical Patriarchate's parish here, Holy Resurrection Orthodox Church - they have no chanters or anyone familiar enough with the complicated Holy Week services- I thus function as chief chanter. The services are long and complex, and I'm singing in English, Romanian, Greek and Slavonic - trying to fit music to words in various languages is not easy. I shall be very glad when Pascha (Easter comes).

         The Crucifixion of Christ   Today He Who hung the earth upon the waters is hung on the tree. The King of the angels is decked with a crown of thorns. He Who wraps the heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. He Who freed Adam in the Jordan is slapped on the face. The Bridegroom of the Church is affixed to the cross with nails. The Son of the Virgin is piecrced by a spear. We worship Thy passion, of Christ, We worship Thy passion, O Christ. Show us also Thy glorious resurrection.  Antiphon XV, after the Third Gospel Reading, Holy Friday Matins    Troparion in tone 2  -  The Noble Joseph, When he had taken down Your most pure Body from the tree, Wrapped it in fine linen, And anointed it with spices, And placed it in a new tomb.

          Great Week   The Hymn chanted in Bridegroom Matins as the Priest carries this icon through the Church (Tone 8)  Behold the Bridegroom comes in the midst of the night; and blessed is the servant, whom He shall find vigilant; and unworthy is he, whom he shall find heedless. Beware, therefore, O my soul, that you will not be overcome by sleep, lest you be given up to death, and be shut out from the Kingdom. Wherefore, rouse yourself, crying out: "Holy, Holy, Holy art Thou, our God, through the prayers of the Mother of God, save us!"  Here we see Christ as the Roman guard adorned Him in purple, with the crown of thorns and a reed for a staff. His hands are bound loosely, signifying that He bore the humiliation willingly. All of Great Lent and Great Week look forward to Pascha (Easter). At Pascha, we celebrate the Bridegroom coming at midnight, that is Christ's coming again in victory. Let us prepare ourselves lest we be caught like the foolish virgins who were not able to join the Wedding Feast.

          "When Thy glorious disciples were enlightened at the washing of their feet before the supper, then the impious Judas was darkened by the disease of avarice, and to the lawless judges he betrayed Thee, the Righteous Judge. Behold, O lover of money, this man because of avarice hanged himself. Flee from the insatiable desire which dared such things against the Master! O Lord who deals righteously with all, glory to Thee!"   Troparion of Holy Thursday .   Of Thy mystical supper, 0 Son of God, accept me today a communicant, for I will not speak of Thy mystery to thine enemies, neither like Judas will I give Thee a kiss, but like the thief will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy kingdom.

       Soundtrack: Senza Fine sung by Monica Mancini.   Hi chaps. I'm taking a wee break from blogging. Spent the weekend with my parents in Malacca, as we were picking up some documents from a friend of dad's there and decided to make it a short overnight trip.   I'm going to watch a few films and unwind. This afternoon I watched Ghost Ship, an absolutely awful horror film from 2002 (or 2001, I forget). What was nice was the italian 60s love song used in the film. I'll quote it below and be done blogging for the day! > Senza fine Tu trascini la nostra vita Senza un attimo di respiro Per sognare Per potere ricordare Cio che abbiamo gia vissuto  Senza fine Tu sei un attimo senza fine Non hai ieri Non hai domani Tutto e ormai nelle tue mani Mani grandi Mani senza fine  Non m'importa della luna Non m'importa delle stelle Tu per me sei luna e stelle Tu per me sei sole e cielo Tu per me sei tutto quanto Tutto quanto io voglio avere  Here follows my attempt at translation:  Without end,  You drag our life Without a moment of breath  In order to dream  To be able to remember  That we have lived  Without end  You are a moment without end,  You have not yesterday  You have not tomorrow  All and by now in your hands  Hands, great Hands, without end  The moon is of no importance The stars are of no importance,  You for me are the moon and stars  You for me are sun and sky  You for me are, Oh, how much  All how much I do not want to have (I have no idea how this translates)  But ah well!

       Soundtrack:   Together We Will Conquer  by Paul Van Dyk. Mmmmm. Trance.     More lovely bitching about the crap film from the chaps at  urlLink Livejournal Classics  DEATHS: Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear. The deaths made me cry. Not with pity or sadness, you understand, but with shock and horror at the stupidity. Giving a list seems to be the best way around my incoherent agony...  Menelaus - He dies. On the SECOND DAY! He's not meant to die. He wins. He gets the girl. He goes home to Sparta. The end. But not, apparently.  Ajax - Also killed on the second day. Apparently, suicide is not an option the film-makers wanted to include, because obviously giving depth to their characters was the last thing they wanted.  Paris - Not actually a death, and therin lies the problem. He's meant to be dead, why isn't he dead?!  The ending? Paris, leaves the city with Helen and Briseis May I be the first to say, WTF?! There's not even a little basis in canon for this. Not even a little. Helen leaves the smoking remains of Troy with Menelaus. Paris is dead [yay!].   And, of course, we must include the immediate distortion of relationships. Agamemnon is established from the first as having something of a feud with Achilles:  "Of all the princes...I hate him the most"  Yep. It's that subtle.  Achilles, obviously, hates him back. Ta Da: instant rivalry! Therin lies the reasoning behind Achilles taking the entire Trojan beach, all by himself, just to show off.  Agamemnon then goes on to cement his appearance as an evil bastard by laughing evilly and proclaiming, at great length, about his brilliance. The ancient greek equivalent of 'I am so great! I am so great! Nyah!' What is equally odd, in light of this, is the dismissal of the Iphigenia episode. I mean, if you want people to think a character is evil, have him kill his own daughter. Cinematically, it's a good bit to include, although obviously easy to misinterpret. But no, this must be missed out, because then if something from the actual story happened (heaven forbid!), then the director might actually have had to go with the canon and let Agamemnon live to get his come-uppance at a later date.  Sheesh.  That said, Agamemnon was so ridiculously evil. I was waiting for the scary music and for him to sprout fangs.  And Orlando Bloom. Tsk, tsk. Does he have more than one facial expression? Or even more than one character basis? I swear, I was having LOTR flash-backs the whole way through. I kid you not.    Didn't the audience come out saying "What was the big deal about a 17 day war ? How did this make Achilles famous ? He won a 17 day war ?"    And then, just the whole "cousin" thing...they tried to ditch the homoeroticism, but instead, everything that could have remotely been related to homosexuality stood out like a sore thumb--because we were all LOOKING for it. Especially with the men flaunting abs and rear ends everywhere you looked!   When students go to literature class and find out it's different in Homer, they gain the greatest lesson that can be taught, that of questioning one's sources and looking past what one is told. The fact that the truth ALWAYS has to be searched for and is never spoken outright by anyone. If a few million americans had learned this, we probably wouldn't be at war now. That's the problem with this. people expected to be handed the truth. you're not going to be. if you want it you have to go looking.    My favorite anachronistic line from the movie: Hector: When will the soldiers from the countryside be here? Random Soldier: Noon.  Yes, noon, and they had watches in Troy?   If you can STILL read more, try this  urlLink list of errors spotted by a Classics student and teacher . Here are my favourites: 1) The war lasts about 16 days in the film, when it is supposed to last 10 years. But a decade more or less, does it really matter?... 2) In the film Agammemnon has unified all Greece... Maybe they confused him with Philip V of Macedonia (Alexander's daddy), who lived 9 centuries later and who was the first to do such a thing. 5) By the way, Sparta is not supposed to be on the sea shore, it is placed in the hinterland, just like in the map they showed 3 seconds before showing the port of Sparta! 19) So, the Trojans used to wear togas?? I was surprised not to see any lictor!  24) It was already amazing to see the 2nd century Romans using stirrups, but it seems now that even the Trojans used it in the 13th century BC... 26) The Achaean army counts 50'000 soldiers... Maybe this is a little too much; I wonder if there was some men left in Greece to protect the land during their absence... 28) I didn't know that the Greeks used money as soon as the Bronze Period... 29) If it was the case (!), they were putting the coin in the mouth of the dead, not on his eyes (but I suppose it is more cinematographic).

      Alright, since a number of readers of this blog seem to have been directed here on account of my  urlLink review of Troy , and I've gotten a few questions on which version of the Iliad they should attempt, here's a little attempt by me to tell you!  Needless to say, ideally, the Iliad (and Homer) should be read in the original Greek, and read ALOUD. It's poetry, after all. Click  urlLink here  to hear Stanley Lombardo, read the first book of the Iliad in the original Greek. That may be slightly boring to those of you who don't understand Homeric Greek (I confess mine isn't terribly good either), and you may recall that Homeric epics were meant to be sung by bards, who told the story to crowds, varying details in each performance. What did that sound like? We can't be sure, but there've been efforts to reconstruct the effect, based on folk epics and storytelling traditions that still survive. There's page about  urlLink Homeric Singing , which contains  urlLink Demodokos' Song  from the Odyssey, sung to a melody based on the pitch accent of the text and accompanied by a reconstruction of the Homeric Phorminx (a sort of 4-stringed harp). The original Greek has a sort of Tummm-ta-ta rhythm that's quite hypnotic, and standard for epic poetry.   I have two criteria for judging translations. Firstly it has to be poetry, with a recognisable rhythm (the Iliad is VERY rhythmic), hence any 'free verse' nonsense is out. Secondly, and perhaps more nebulously, it has to feel like Homer. I'll quote the opening of each so you get an idea of what they're like. Here's a very basic English translation as reference (numbers in square brackets indicate line numbers in the original Greek): The wrath sing, goddess, of Peleus' son, Achilles, that destructive wrath which brought countless woes upon the Achaeans, and sent forth to Hades many valiant souls of heroes, and made them themselves spoil for dogs and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment, [5] from the time when first they parted in strife Atreus' son, king of men, and brilliant Achilles. If you want a very old-fashioned English verse translation of Homer's Iliad, check out  urlLink Alexander Pope's version of 1725 : urlLink    Achilles’ wrath, to Greece the direful spring Of woes unnumber’d, heavenly goddess, sing! That wrath which hurl’d to Pluto’s gloomy reign The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain; Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore, Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore. Since great Achilles and Atrides strove, Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove! Very pretty, and very poetic, but it's not Homer - it's Pope. Still, Pope's translation is very pretty to read, even though he adds in all sorts of 1725-ish details.   Next, there are the modern versions available:  urlLink    Lattimore, 1951 : Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilleus and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaeans, hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished since that time when first there stood in division of conflict Atreus' son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus.   urlLink    Fagles, 1990 : Rage--Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls, great fighters' souls, but made their bodies carrion, feasts for the dogs and birds, and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end. Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed, Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles.       urlLink    Lombardo, 1997 : Rage: Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage, Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls Of heroes into Hades' dark, And left their bodies to rot as feasts for dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done. Begin with the clash between Agamemnon--v The Greek warlord--and godlike Achilles. Each of the translators has made a series of choices in translating Homer into English. All of the translators are attempting to be accurate, clear, and readable, but they express these qualities in different ways.  Lattimore's translation has been often praised for its accuracy and poetic qualities. It manages to be literal without being stiff and matches Homer's phrasing closely. It also uses a number of devices to maintain the 'strangeness' of Homer: Achilleus is Achilleus (reflecting the original Greek), not Achilles; Hades is mentioned in line 4 without further explanation; and in line 7 Lattimore renders the Greek faithfully with the patronymic 'Atreus' son,' rather than substituting the name Agamemnon as the other two translators do. Lattimore, like the other translators, decided not to render Homer's dactylic hexameter in his translation into a strict English meter, such as dactylic hexameter or iambic pentameter, but instead chose a naturally stressed free verse. In Lattimore's case, he aimed at a regular six-beat stressed line, letting the natural stresses of the English words carry the rhythm along. For example, the first line can be read and stressed as follows in English (an accent ['] mark indicates which syllables are stressed): Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilleus The meter is beautiful to the ear, especially when longer passages are read aloud in English. Finally, Lattimore's translation matches Homer's Greek line for line. For example, Lattimore's Iliad Book I is 611 lines long, the same length as Homer's. In contrast, Fagles' Iliad Book I is 745 lines long, Lombardo's 643.   Fagles and Lombardo were each trying for something different from Lattimore. Fagles tries to bridge the gap between Greek culture and our own by being more accessible: the word 'Rage' is repeated twice in line 1 to emphasize that 'rage' (μήνιν in Greek) is the first word and a major theme of the poem; in line 3 "the house of Hades" has become 'the House of Death'; 'carrion,' not in the Greek, has been added in line 4, as has 'Muse' in line 7, to help the reader understand who the Goddess is the poet addresses in line 1; and 'Agamemnon' has been substituted in line 8 for the more obscure 'Ατρείδη - Atreus' son.' Lombardo's main goal is to emphasize one characteristic of Homeric Greek above all else: its speed. Homeric Greek is supple and moves quickly, and to try to capture this aspect Lombardo writes a shorter English line and drops words and phrases from Homer. 'Peleus' son' drops out of line 1, 'Achaeans' is shortened to 'Greeks' in line 2, Homer's "strong souls" become simply "souls" in line 3, and again 'Atreus' son' has become 'Agamemnon' in line 8. Both Fagles and Lombardo also wrote their translations as poetry to be read aloud. Fagles says in his introduction that he used a flexible line of five, six, and occasionally seven beats, while Lombardo's metrics are quite free, designed to reflect the stress and rhythm of ordinary speech in the service of speed.  All three of these translations have their strengths and weaknesses. The reason that I recommend the Lattimore translation is that the majority of Classics scholars have found that it offers the accuracy, clarity, and readability that works effectively in trying to read Homer. Lattimore's translation can be more demanding than the other translations, but so far faculty and students have found that it offers an excellent means for studying the Iliad and the culture it portrays. There will undoubtedly be a time when Lattimore's translation is replaced by another one for me, since no translation, no matter how great, keeps its vitality forever, but this will only happen when it is obvious to the me that the new translation will allow new generations of readers to enter into Homer's world in a way that Lattimore's no longer can.  On the other hand, if you don't really want a feel of Homer, but want a gripping read, try Lombardo's version. Compare the two translations when Agamemnon replies to the priest of Apollo, who is asking for his daughter Chryses back:  Lombardo, 1997: 'Don't let me ever catch you, old man, by these ships again,  Skulking around now or sneaking back later.  The god's staff and ribbons won't save you next time.  The girl is mine, and she'll be an old woman in Argos  Before I let her go, working the loom in my house  And coming to my bed, far from her homeland.  Now clear out of here before you make me angry!'  Lattimore, 1951: 'Never let me find you again, old sir, near our hollow ships, neither lingering now nor coming again hereafter, for fear your staff and the god's ribbons help you no longer. The girl I will not give back; sooner will old age come upon her in my own house, in Argos, far from her own land, going up and down by the loom and being in my bed as my companion. Sso go now, do not make me angry; so you will be safer.'  I think that really sums it up. One's like something out of a novel and the other's epic.

      ... that reading the Bible without reference to Tradition could get you in trouble?  A man was looking for some guidance from God so he asked God to make his Bible open at the page He wanted him to read. So the man opened his bible randomly and the first verse that his eyes met was 2 Corinthians 13:12,  "Greet one another with a holy kiss."  A little discouraged he tried again and this time he found himself at 1 Corinthians 14:39  "Do not forbid the use of tongues."   The classic example is the guy who opened to  "Judas went out and hanged himself" , tried again and found  "Go thou and do likewise..."   [from  urlLink Shrine of the Holy Whapping ]

       Soundtrack:   Love Flows Like A River  by Tuck & Patti. Folksy Jazz, great for parties and relaxing.    Ah, I'm in sartorial lust again. This time, it's the house of   urlLink Berluti  , a Parisian luxury shoe brand, dating from 1895 when an Italian shoemaker, Alessandro Berluti, moved to Paris and opened a shop. Berluti makes stunning shoes with a deep burnished shine, like expensive hardwoods. Have a look at their website, their  Club ,    Dandy    and  Tatoues    models are to die for. I showed them to a friend and he said "they have to be wood.. it's not humanly possible for leather to shine like that". Prices start at £650 for ready-made shoes and £2000 for bespoke shoes.   Incidentally, Berluti made the most expensive pair of shoes to date, a pearl-studded pair for 'Emperor' Bokassa of the Central African Empire (now Republic), for his self-coronation in 1977, and those loafers cost a whopping $85,000 USD.   Oh, in other news... Justin brought the girlfriend along. But that's alright, cos she was nice and I've decided she's ok. We had a good catching up session. Justin's still yummily buff as always.

       Soundtrack: 流水Liu Shui, a piece for Chinese ch'in zither, apparently dating back to the middle Ming dynasty (hence 1400s or so).    urlLink   This one's an interesting site, a home of the late Ch'ing (Qing for you pinyin Nazis) Dynasty, from Anhui province, moved in toto to America and restored beautifully. It's now at the  urlLink Peabody Essex Museum  in Salem, Massachusets, and is the only complete, historic Chinese house located outside China. The website is beautifully constructed and shows great attention to detail. The artefacts, the construction, daily use as well as the dismantling and later restoration and re-erection in America is explained extensivly and lavishly illustrated. Of course, everyone should have a deep knowledge and abiding interest in Chinese architecture, culture and history, so the site should be a source of great joy to all, but should one be such an unthinkable boor as to lack all of these things, the site will still remain an excellent example of how a museum website should work.

       Soundtrack:   Gloria  from Guillaume Machaut's  La Messe de Nostre Dame , sung by the Ensemble Organum. One of the earliest pieces of Renaissance Polyphony, dating from the 1300s. Fascinating, as it still feels very Mediaeval, but at the same time, it looks forward to Palestrina in some moments. This performance by Ensemble Organum introduces some rather Byzantine-sounding ornaments and is *quite* interesting.  I got 17 out of 20 right in this test.  Most people are surprisingly bad at spotting fake smiles. One possible explanation for this is that it may be easier for people to get along if they don't always know what others are really feeling.   I'm GOOD.  Meanwhile, after a long and tiring day of meetings, I'm having dinner with Justin Soo, whom I've not seen in something like a year. I do hope he's not bringing his girlfriend with him. Yes, I'm slightly jealous of her, but there's more than that. Yes, she's a nice girl, but she's so simperingly feminine that it drives me up the wall. She coos and poses... she's the sort of girl who takes two bites of a meal and declares herself full, and will only eat one more mouthful if her boyfriend feeds it to her. Ugh. Girls like that make me want to throttle myself.. Justin and I have been friends for over a decade now (some of my circle have been friends with him even longer), and he's a close old friend.. but none of us have been able to see him this past year without him bringing his little girlfriend along.   I'm currently looking through a pictoral catalogue of Ming and Ch'ing furniture mum brough home (a book, not a collection of furniture!)... and drooling at the chinese antiques. Would that I could afford them. Ha. Would that I could afford a lot of things...

       Soundtrack:   Sonata Duodecima  by Dario Castello, played by the Palladian Ensemble.  my prescription:  Prednisolone: 5mg morning, 2.5mg evening Famotidine: 40mg morning, 40mg evening Telfast: 180mg morning afternoon and evening hydroxizine: 25mg morning and afternoon, 50mg evening.   Whee. Great fun. I'm on ultra-high doses of anti-histamines to control the hives, the docs are trying to wean me off the steroids which I've been on for nearly half a year now. Steroids are bad in the long-term - I've gained weight, had constant skin breakouts, been subject to mood swings... I'm a Spotty Grumpy Whale, basically.   Just took my evening dose with a gulp of Amaretto - it was the only drink I had to hand. Someobody tell me why taking medication with alcohol is a bad idea? It's never been explained to me properly.   Cooked dinner this evening for the family. I figured pasta would be quick and easy.Started off with a basic Aglio e Olio recipe - olive oil, lots of garlic and chilli... but I decided to jazz it up with a good amount of chopped mushrooms. Then I had the idea of adding the juice of half a lemon. The result? An Aglio e Olio that had a bit more texture than usual and a slight tanginess that complemented the oiliness nicely.  Used the leftover lemon juice with olive oil for a salad dressing, but again, with a difference - a few dashes of sesame oil into the olive oil. The ensuing lemony-olivy-sesameish flavour is very very good.   Oh if you want a cheap laugh, go  urlLink here .   I've been having discussions with friends on the nature of friendship recently. How often do friends need to be in touch and see each other? I've friends with whom I'm in regular contact online and via text messaging, and hence I don't see that often - some of these I see perhaps once a year or even less, although we talk online perhaps several times a month. I've friends with whom I've not had contact with for years, but when the deep bond of friendship is there, once we meet again or talk online again... the gap of years falls away and it's as if we'd never parted. There are friends I see often because we live in the same city and  constantly have stuff to update each other on and bitch about, or perhaps we move in roughly the same circles and these circles cross every so often.   Dependency is not healthy for any friendship, I've come to realise that. When one party constantly leans on the other, it's not good. Friendship is something that can only exist between equals. While I'm not advocating choosing friends based on a possibility of benefit, it should be obvious to anyone that a mentor-student relationship is not a true friendship. Really close friends aren't co-dependent, aren't sticky and their intimacy isn't forced. The distance between the two has to be comfortable for both.   I'm reminded of a Chinese saying: 君子之交淡如水 小人之交甜如蜜 It translates roughly as 'The relations between gentlemen is bland like water, the relations between little people is sweet like honey'. Alas, the literal translation carries none of the force of the original. The idea is that Gentlemen friends keep a respectful distance between each other and aren't over familiar, presuming to want to know every detail of each other's lives, whereas 'little people' or 'people of small minds' are sticky and extremely close all the time, cloyingly sweet like honey. There's also the idea that the water in the first bit is clear, pure and flowing... silent but deep. I know, it's not in the translation, but it's all implied. That's one of the glories of the Chinese language - its terseness, rather like Latin.   There's the striking mental image that comes to mind - two Chinese scholars in robes of the archaic period (like Confucius) standing on opposite sides of a gently flowing stream, bowing respectfully to each other. Then the second part of the saying brings to mind two crude peasants, scruffy and rough, arms on each other's shoulders, both of them enjoying sticks of candied haws (which are very sticky) and getting it all over themselves (hence sticking to each other) while loudly joking.   In other news, I've continued reading the Iliad. There is such an abundance of glorious lines in there... lines that I have to remember and use when appropriate. I'll collect them as I find them and post them here in Greek and English. Quotes such as Hector's curse to Paris "we should have given you a coat of stone long ago" - i.e. a stoning. Don't be surprised I can't remember the Greek, for Homeric Greek is as different from Classical Greek as Beowulf is from Chaucer. Imagine a novel written in a mix of Ebonics, Scots, Rap-talk and Engish... that's what the Iliad is like, as the Homeric language is a mishmash of various dialects.   Andrij sent me this lovely quote from Metro (a free London daily newspaper distributed in the Underground stations): "I almost wet myself listening to Brad Pitt making a fool of himself at a press conference in Cannes while pitifully attempting to explain Homer's intentions when writing The Iliad. Shut up and be pretty, girly-man!" I'll end this post and go to bed with one more quote, this time from  urlLink Pensate Omnia : What would happen to society if it were actually possible -- from an economic and political point of view -- to radically redistribute wealth and opportunity in such a way that all people were equally well educated, cultured and groomed? Now, I think this goal is sorta nice (maybe), but completely impossible in reality. But, all that aside, how would society function if such a liberal/progressive vision actually happened? Who would work in McDonalds, or drive semi trucks, or clean hotel rooms, or sit behind a little desk answering phones all day? Seriously.  Society would fail if everyone were well educated, cultured and groomed.

       Soundtrack:  Haydn's  Cello Concerto  in C Major, played by Christophe Coin and the Academy of Ancient Music, directed by Christopher Hogwood. Stunningly beautiful and gorgeously lyrical. Review available  urlLink here . I find Coin's version better than Yo-Yo Ma's, as Coin specialises in period cello, and Ma doesn't.   Ah, I so love Haydn's music. There's a mixture of geniality and sanity about his work that I find irresistable. I actually prefer him to Mozart by far. Mozart is exuberant and giggly, like a little child in bright colours running about the place. Haydn, in contrast, is quietly elegant and always serene, rather more like a perfectly mannered adolescent girl of the 18th Century in an understated silk brocade dress, with a gentle smile on her lips.    Someone once said that while Mozart seems to walk on air, and Beethoven digs down into the depths, Haydn always kept his feet on the ground, and I think that is perhaps one of the reasons I love his music so. He was a genius, but never a tormented or showy genius. He has been accurately described as 'the most comforting and humane of composers' and he wrote music, he said, so that the 'weary and the worn, or the man burdened with affairs, may enjoy a few moments of solace and refreshment'. It is hard to think of a more modest, or beguiling, description of the consolation of great art (and music in particular).  Come to think of it, Haydn may well have been my introduction to classical music. Mum tells me while I was yet in the womb, she would play her classical records (one of the favourites was Haydn's  Cello Concerti ) and talk to me, saying something like 'you must listen to music like this when you grow up, ok? None of that horrible noisy modern stuff!'. Apparently it's worked for the most part, even though I quite like Trance, for I find myself constantly coming back to Jazz and Classical for solace.   Piece Of Useless Information : the melody of the German anthem  Deutschland Uber Alles  is taken from the slow movement of a Haydn string quartet.

      Francis I of France and the Pope once met in one of those show-off friendly encounters that Renaissance monarchs used to enjoy. One night, the king and the Pope exchanged lutenists: Francesco da Milano played for Francis, and Albert de Rippe played for the Pope. After Francesco was done, Francis thanked him and gave him his weight in gold. After Albert was done playing, the Pope thanked him and gave him ... his blessing.

       Soundtrack:  Arvo Pärt's  Kanon Pokajanen , Slightly out of synch, I know, but hey, it's good stuff!  Two cartoons about Troy this morning:   urlLink Troy, the Gabriel Cut   and   urlLink this one  . It could have been a "gay" film, but nooooooo, they had to be "cousins"...   Just for kicks, some friends and I have been compiling a list of works from Western literature that are messed up by the "artistic licenses" taken in Troy. Here it goes...   Homer:   The Odyssey   Aeschylus:   The Oresteia   Euripides:   Andromache  Electra  Hecuba  Helen (in Egypt)  Iphigenia at Aulis/Iphigenia Among the Taurians  Orestes  The Trojan Women   Sophocles:   Ajax  Electra  Philoctetes   Vergil:   The Aeneid  The Eclogues (mention Paris as a shepherd...so I guess this is kind of nitpicky)   Ovid:   The Metamorphoses  The Heroides   Dante:   The Inferno   Shakespeare:   Troilus and Cressida   Goethe's:   Iphigenie auf Tauris  Faust  Now, I'm sure we're missing some, so feel free to add what you can think of. Personally, I liked the movie for its entertainment value (and nothing else), but you have to wonder just how many artistic licenses you are entitled to when something forms the basis of Western literature.       You very own Odyssey. by  urlLink  laurel_blossom        Name:           Who accompanied you?    Telemachus      What was your mode of transportation?

That's my  urlLink Phlog ! You'll be wondering what a Phlog is, naturally. The answer is simple, and I'll let the chaps at  urlLink Whisk  explain:   Phlogger is an extension to your blog. When you blog, you usually have to be at home online, but what Phlogger does is it allows you to blog thru your phone, by SMS or MMS, and whatever you type will go into your blog almost immediately, anytime, anywhere. Perfect for while you're out and you're hit with a sudden urge to blog something to all your readers, before you forget it once you're home. Too cool to be true? Nope, it's here and it's free! [ urlLink more ] It can be used either as a standalone or embedded into a blog (as I've chosen to do)... it's apparently quite popular with school-age adolescents (I found the link from a former student's blog) in Singapore (the company's Singapore-based), and I like to think I'm 17 (for the tenth year running), so that's ok. Right, so now I have a  urlLink phlog  - I'm officially  kewl *  .  It's a cute idea, but let's wait and see how long before phlogging becomes a dead horse.    * - incidentally, how  does  one pronounce "kewl"? Is the "kew" pronounced identical with "Kew" (as as in the Gardens) and "Queue"?

      from  urlLink Lew Rockwell :    urlLink A Sense of Wonder : by Charley Reese .  "Both Christianity and Zen urge us to return to a childlike state so that we can experience the wonder and the beauty of the world. Our memories of childhood are so vivid because then we lived in the present moment, encumbered neither by memories nor worries about the future."  It's a blessing to be able to do that, being able to live "in the moment" and enjoy life to the fullest. I know I've still got a bit of that child-like wonder, I wonder how long I'll be able to keep it.     urlLink Best Teller : by Robert McCrum .  This one's quite good, a bit of speculation about the identity of Homer. Why's Homer so important? Well, Western civilisation worships the Romans. The Romans worshipped the Greeks. The Greeks worshipped Homer. That rather makes him like God then...  Two men who tell it like it is, from  urlLink Serge :   urlLink  "The Israelis Are Acting Like Nazis!"  says Holocaust survivor Yosef Lapid.  An Israeli Jew who isn't afraid to face the truth and call it evil.     urlLink "Poor blacks can't speak English, shouldn't blame the police for imprisonment and have themselves to blame for being poor!"  says Bill Cosby.   "Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal. These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids – $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.'  He added: "They're standing on the corner and they can't speak English. I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' ... And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk. ... Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. ... You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!"  There's more - speaking about blacks in prison: "These are not political criminals," he said. "These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, [saying] 'The cops shouldn't have shot him.' What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?" Thank Athena some black person has the guts to say this, for in their current state of victimhood-mentality, the black community won't let anyone of any other colour get away with it. Perhaps they'll listen up this time.

       O Westron Wynde when wylt thow blow The small rayne downe can rayne Cryst yf my love were in my armys And I yn my bed agayne.  (Anon., before 1500)  O Western Wind, when wilt thou blow The small rain down can rain Christ, if my love were in my arms And I in my bed again  I miss you. Not a day gone by these nearly two years when I haven't thought about you. You know who you are. I know you think of and miss me too, yet also do I know I wish not for your return. We're not good for each other, even though our intentions were good and we wished only the best for each other. My life is complicated enough as it is. You know full well you complicate things even further. Oddly though, while you were in my life, the instability and volatility of our relationship was a dependable constant. Our intimacy was luminous while it lasted, but we should both move on now. It's true, all good things come to an end, but wish I to the gods that it had ended otherwise. I hope we both end up in the same place in Eternity, for I'd rather be able to love you perfectly in the next life than to have you in this life, where all love is imperfect.  If Love's a Sweet Passion, why does it torment? If a Bitter, oh tell me, whence comes my content? Since I suffer with pleasure, why should I complain, Or grieve at my Fate, when I know 'tis in vain? Yet so pleasing the Pain is, so soft is the Dart, That at once it both wounds me and tickles my Heart.  (from Henry Purcell's  The Fairy Queen )  O how often I thought those words to myself when we fought and argued. I suppose it's all part of growing up, this childish love-affair. After we parted, for the longest time I could not bear to listen to Noël Coward's  Someday I'll Find You  without tearing, for I thought of you each time I heard these lyrics: Someday I'll find you, Moonlight behind you, True to the dream I am dreaming. As I draw near you'll smile a little smile; For a while We shall stand Hand in hand. I'll leave you never, Love you forever, All our past sorrow redeeming: Try to make it true, Say you love me too, Someday I'll find you again. Still, I shall remember what we had with a smile through the years, tho it be bitter-sweet at best. Perhaps Coward's  Let's Say Good-bye  is relevant here: Let our affair be a gay thing, And when these hours have flown. Then, without forgetting Happines that has passed, There'll be no regretting Fun that didn't quite last. Let's look on love as plaything, All these sweet moments we've known Mustn't be degraded When the thrill of them has faded, Let's say 'Good-bye' And leave it alone. Be well, and take good care of yourself.

      from  urlLink Dappled Things : I admit to detesting those red t-shirts with Che Guevara's face on them. The people who wear them are, more likely than not, as ignorant of Che Guevara as they are of any other historical figure, so I suppose we should cut them some slack. Still, it's a despicable fad.  urlLink The Telegraph has a piece on the fashionability of Che  (whom it calls "the murdering savage") at the Cannes festival.  What was he about? Here's a bit of information: He was not a Cuban, but a high-born Argentinian who as a young man was appalled by the plight of the poor of South America. As so often happens, however, he combined a hatred of an existing system with the super-ego of privilege and with a self-ordained exemption from all law and morality. The outcome, classically, was a merciless revolutionary, who revelled in homicidal violence, both as a means and an end.  Within a month of the Fidelistas' triumph, with Guevara's secret Communist cell driving the process, more than 500 ex-members of the deposed regime were murdered. When a young revolutionary urged caution, the Argentinian abused him roundly. "What a shit-eater you are," he roared. "We must make the revolution in a struggle to the death against imperialism from the first moment."  Not content with the bloodshed in Cuba, he travelled to Africa to preach Marxist violence to the pre-literates of the Congo. But many brands of violence, even cannibalism, were vying in that charming marketplace and, unable to compete, he returned to Cuba. His next mission was to mainland South America to create - in his own words - a continental inferno, another Vietnam, which would ultimately destroy the US. So, all in all, an admirable fellow...  The poster of Guevara on an undergraduate wall is an echo of this fatuity, a historically-ignorant and adolescent rejection of the poor devil who is paying for the flat. Above all, Guevara's enduring status in film and populist imagery is proof of mankind's pathetic inability to recognise evil when its guise is beauty and its lie is love. Don't even get me started on the idiots around the world (especially in Britain) who happily wear teeshirts with the hammer and sickle or CCCP on them. They have no idea of the evil that drives Communism.

      from  urlLink The Curt Jester : Fuzhou (AsiaNew/Ucan) - A Marian shrine in Fujian province has attracted a large number of Protestants as well as Catholics this May.   Sister Zheng Wenying of Fuzhou estimates that at least 1,000 Protestants from Fujian and neighboring provinces had visited Rosary Hill Village by the middle of the month that Catholics traditionally devote to Mary. Most came in groups ranging from dozens to a hundred, led by Protestant pastors.  Sister Zheng told that nuns of the diocese explained Catholic teachings about the Blessed Mother to some visiting Protestant groups. Some members of these groups agreed that revering both Jesus and his mother would make their Christian faith more complete, she said, adding that "some even knelt and prayed in the church."   WOW.

       urlLink Doxos  has been reading about a series on " urlLink Verbal Independence ", and it's quite interesting.  For cultural distinctiveness the LS eschews the use of Webster's so-called "American" English orthography which actually is nothing more than a bastardisation of the proper and correct English language by New England busybodies.       Whenever possible, we prefer to use the more traditional, antebellum Southern English orthography; widely known to many as the Oxford standard which once saw widespread usage in Dixie prior to the War for Southern Independence and Reconstruction and even some limited use afterwards...  the Oxford standard is the most widely accepted and orthodox orthography in the English-speaking world.  It is actually the most accurate guide to the spelling of the English language available today, and we proudly re-embrace it as a part of our Southron language.  It's fascinating, as they advocate a standard that's almost identical with English.

       I'm in sartorial lust again. I was just reminded of a beautiful pair of shoes I saw and tried on with Justin Soo 2 years back in London:  urlLink    urlLink     Red House , they call it. No patterns, no stitching, no broguing - just one single piece of leather for the upper. They looked gorgeous on me and felt like heaven. Now imagine them in this sort of Burnished Tan colour:  urlLink    But alas, they're over £200 a pair - £220 for the simpler model and £297 for the best ones. The rest of the  urlLink site 's stunning too - I love their shoes! Keep on drooling, Ed. ( That's a hint for you readers to pool some money together to buy me a pair! )   Tried finding a new toothbrush today. All the shops had were Soft and Medium. Doesn't anyone use Hard toothbrushes anymore? There will be no jokes about putting hard things in my mouth. ( Anthony, this means you! )   Had a brunch appointment with Remí today, and thanks to his usual punctuality, it turned into a lunch appointment. I was glad to see him again - he's doing alright in National Service, almost nearing the end of his BMT (Basic Military Training). He's deeply tanned, has no hair, but has kept his sense of humour. He loves the humanities deeply, and cannot imagine life without music, books and beautiful things. He also wants me to run a sort of intense crash-course in high-culture for him when he has his week of leave after finishing BMT, before he gets posted to a unit. We'll see about that. He's such a sweet little goof.   The quite-good and conveniently-located Bellagio's Gelato in Holland Village in Singapore has closed. I only realised this when Cheryl and I went down for a spot of Gelato after lunch today and found, to our horror, the place empty and a "For Rent" sign up. A pity, they weren't bad and not too expensive either. Ye shall be missed. The blazing tropical heat seemed a lot hotter after that.   It seems that the Turks are now claiming Homer was Turkish, and that he was actually named Omar. Ha. Speaking of Omars...   Omar Sharif, the venerable actor, now aged 71, is learning ancient Greek: Fluent in several languages, the elder Sharif said he has taken up the study of ancient Greek.  "One of two things will happen: I will have died learning something useless but beautiful, or I shall die having read Homer in the original. It may seem stupid but you have to have a beautiful mission in life."  Good for him!    Reading my friend  urlLink Alfian's blog , I have new respect for the Malay tongue, which I had hitherto considered a primitive and savage language: Malay is a subtle and complex language, and its many modes of pronoun address are enough to give me a headache. Take, for example the word 'we'. In Malay, two versions of 'we' exist: one, 'kami', excludes the person addressed to, and 'kita', includes this person. If I take such examples of exclusion and inclusion further, then it is possible to conclude that Malay society is extremely stratified, going back to its early feudal roots, where separation was enforced between the court and the rakyat, the formal and colloquial.  I'm surprised that the distinction exists in Malay - it certainly doesn't exist in any language that I know, and I recall asking my teachers of ancient tongues at King's College whether there were different sorts of the pronoun  "we/us"  that included or excluded the person to whom it was addressed.

      link from  urlLink Serge :  Arriving in Fátima the pilgrims made their way to the Chapel of the Apparitions, where from the altar a Hindu priest led prayer sessions... The Hindu priest is then seen clothing the Rector of the Fátima Shrine and the bishop with a Hindu priestly shawl. “On the shoulders of the highest representatives of the Church in Fátima, the Hindu priest places a shawl with the inscriptions of the Bhaghavad Gita, one of the sacred books of Hinduism,” the reporter tells his viewers... The newscast finishes with scenes of the Hindu priest lighting a candle at the shrine while his followers dance outside the Chapel of the Apparitions chanting praises to their gods.   Abomination. No other word is suitable.   Now, there's a place for respecting other religions, but violating Christian sanctuaries is really too much. The Christian altar is to be used for no purpose other than worship of the God of the Christians, and the Bishop allowing himself to be clothed with a Hindu priestly shawl is appalling. As for the Hindus dancing ourside the Shrine while "chanting praises to their gods", I keep thinking "Baal has conquered the God of Israel". While in no wise do I advocate the beyond-insane fundamentalism of the Mahometans, I cannot imagine any Mullah allowing the same in a mosque anywhere in the world, and for that I respect them greatly.   Mutual respect and co-operation (where mutually benficial) between religions is good, we must not fall into indifferentism, for  "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice unto demons, and not to God." 1 Corinthians 10:20    I'm sorry. The holy martyrs did not die rather than offer incense to pagan gods so that their successors could allow this in our churches. I'd like to burn those who allowed this abomination, but the waiting list of apostate clergy and laity is miles long. Instead, I'll content myself with writing a bit of imitation liturgical poetry. Those of you who are Orthodox or know the Byzantine rite may find this familiar in tone:   O Apostate Priests, how ye have sold yourselves! Judas received thirty pieces of silver to betray the Son of Man - what was your recompense for bringing the abomination into the Holy of Holies? Judas bent his neck to betray Christ with a kiss, and the false-bishop of Fátima bends his neck to receive the demon-inspired writings. Idols of wood and gold have eyes which see not, ears which hear not and mouths which speak not, yet in laying them upon the altar of God, your wickedness cries out to Heaven for vengeance. The episcopal ring, the sign of fidelity, thou wearest, O false-Bishop, but instead thou hast raped God's bride, the Church. Elias laughed as the priests of Baal danced in vain, but ye smile and welcome the priests of darkness in to dance upon the holy ground of God. O faithless ones, O heartless traitors, ye have shewn yourselves servants of darkness! But by the prayers of the Saints and Martyrs faithful to thee,O Christ, confirm the rest of us in the faith.   What ought to be done to that bishop? He ought to be defrocked - as should all the rest of the bishops of the world who've hushed up sexual scandals and misconduct in the church. In case you weren't aware, there actually  IS  a ritual for that: the  "Degradation of a Bishop" (Degradatio ab ordine pontificali) , which can be found in the Roman Pontifical ( Pontificale Romanum ) of Pope Benedict XIV.  When he promulgated this ritual in 1862, Pope Benedict obviously felt that it was necessary. He envisioned the possibility that a bishop could disgrace himself so thoroughly, and abuse his office so blatantly, that the Holy See would have no choice but to remove him. Such a bishop would not be allowed to resign quietly "for reasons of health;" he would not be transferred to a titular see in the Sahara; he would not be "promoted" to a meaningless desk job at the Vatican. He would be stripped of his office and--the word is so beautifully expressive--" degraded ."  Since CWR first published this ritual, a dozen bishops have been forced to resign, in America and other countries, after accusations of gross sexual misconduct. We have every reason to believe that more such resignations will soon be forthcoming. Isn't it a shame that their resignations were accomplished through impersonal communication--by mail and by fax--rather than with a formal liturgical ceremony?   THE RITE OF DEGRADATION   If the  degradandus  (the person to be degraded) be an archbishop, the degrading prelate removes his pallium (the bishop's stole), saying:  We deprive thee of the rights and privileges of the episcopal dignity, symbolized in this pallium, since thou hast abused them.  Then, even if the  degradandus  be a mere bishop, the degrading prelate removes his mitre, saying:  We strip thy head of this mitre, emblem of the episcopal dignity, since thou hast befouled it by thy ill government.  Then one of the ministers brings the Book of the Gospel to the  degradandus , which the degrading prelate takes from his hands, saying;  Give us back the Gospel! Since thou hast spurned the grace of God and made thyself unworthy of the office of preaching, we rightly deprive you of this office.  Then the degrading prelate removes the ring from the finger of the  degradandus , saying:  Rightly do we pull off thy ring, the sign of fidelity, since thou hast made bold to rape God's own bride, the Church.  At this time one of the ministers brings the  degradandus  a crosier, which the degrading prelate takes from his hands, saying;  Thy shepherd's staff we take from thee, that thou shalt be powerless henceforward to exercise that office of correction, which thou hast brought to disarray.  Then the ministers take off the gloves of the  degradandus , and the degrading prelate lightly scrapes thumbs and hands with a knife blade or a shard of glass, saying:  We hereby deprive thee, to the extent of our powers, of the grace of spiritual blessing and of sacramental anointing, that thou shouldst forfeit the office of sanctifying and of blessing, and their effects.  With the same knife blade or shard the degrading prelate lightly scrapes the head of the  degradandus , saying:  We utterly erase and eradicate the consecration, blessing and anointing bestowed upon thee, and we put thee out of the episcopal order, whence thou returnest unclothed.  The ministers remove the shoes from the  degradandus . Thus ends the ceremony.  No doubt the last is to signify that the man can no longer follow in the footsteps of the Apostles. It is a humiliating ceremony and most necessary in these times when so many bishops have indeed abused their rights and privileges, disgraced their administration, made themselves unworthy of their preaching office, shamelessly raped God's very Own Bride, and mismanaged their pastoral office. If ever there was a time for the renewal of the Office of Degradation, it is now.

      from  urlLink Rogue Classicism :  We've read about this group before, but they're getting a pile of press coverage all of a sudden, especially in the southeast Asian press, for some reason:     On a sweet Athenian spring evening with the sacred rock of the Acropolis bathed in the white light of a full moon, a chorus of voices join in prayer, chanting: “Hail Zeus!”      The voices are not those of actors in an ancient tragedy or an Olympic ceremony, but a group of modern-day Athenians solemnly worshipping the Olympian Gods.      Long before the Olympic Games became a rich commercial bonanza, they were among the most important religious festivals of the ancient Greeks, held in honour of the heavenly 12 of Mount Olympus. Now, as the Games return to their birthplace in August, a small group of Greeks are pressing for official acknowledgment of their pre-Christian roots.      They have applied for formal religious recognition and sought court injunctions against the commercial exploitation of their religious symbols by organisers of Athens 2004. The trouble is, no-one is taking them seriously. In some cases they even face prosecution for participating in an illegal cult.      While classical Greece is revered as the seat of Western civilisation, its gods, heroes and monsters are more commonly associated these days with the muscle-bound characters in American-made cartoons. Gathered on the balcony of a 21st-century Athens penthouse, adults stand with their eyes screwed shut, hands aloft and coloured ribbons in their hair as the moon is eclipsed.      A plastic God Apollon looks down nobly from his black teak altar. On his right, Athena is wearing a warlike helmet, while an image of a bare-breasted Aphrodite recalls her status as the Goddess of love.      Turquoise ribbon: The worshippers finish their full moon ceremony by linking arms to form a circle.      Vasileos, a chemical engineer who preferred not to give his surname, is convinced that he and his fellow worshippers are the real Greeks and that Orthodox Christians are impostors. “Who were these early Christians? They were the great unwashed, they had no athletics, no culture and they only had one book – the bible.”      Georgios, a distinguished lawyer with a turquoise ribbon in his hair to signify the circle of life, cannot see where the credibility problem lies. “The ancient Greeks invented logic, science, medicine and philosophy and built the Parthenon. Are you telling me they didn’t know what they were doing when it came to religion?” he asked.      Panayiotis Marinis, a doctor and spiritual leader of the group, was born into a family of polytheists in the tiny village of Kithra on the island of Kefalonia. He said the tradition was still strong in many smaller communities. “My family were believers, a lot of people in our village were,” he said.      He pointed to the huge crowds who have followed the Olympic torch since it was lit in a ceremony borrowed straight from the traditions of their religion. Marinis estimated there were as many as 100,000 followers of the 12 gods spread around Greece but they were no closer to getting state recognition.      They have been waiting for two years for an answer to a petition for an official place of worship to the Greek ministry of education and religious affairs.     ...     Many in the group are unimpressed by Orthodox Christianity which they regard as an unwanted visitor to Greek shores. “Christianity was the first form of globalisation,” said Doretta, a writer. “To us a god is not a boss, he is a friend, and you can fall out with friends — look at Odysseus and Poseidon,” she added in reference to a famous spat between the Greek warrior and the God of the sea.

      Despite what you have been told at various times by assorted dusty tomes, the voices in your head, Homer, the penguins, and the reincarnation of Julius Caesar, it is probably not a good idea to start muttering dark imprecations (in dead languages) against certain people you are not fond of.  It is almost assuredly a bad idea to attempt to turn these muttered imprecations into curse tablets.  I can guarantee you that it is a very bad idea indeed to try to use your assorted dusty tomes as a set of instruction manuals to do so. Placing ancient curses always runs the risk of irritating the more, er, snarky cthonic deities. But they can usually be placated with a decent libation. And maybe a tapdance.  Especially Egyptian ones. Don't even think of trying a spell in Egyptian because the last time you tried, you stumbled over the hieroglyphs, and we all know mispronouncing things in spells is a recipe for disaster. You know full well the Opening of the Mouth is the one and only Egyptian spell you can handle.   Besides...where would you find a sheet of lead in Singapore at this time of night?  ------- Addendum:  I tend to doubt it's a good sign that you're even capable of formulating dark imprecations in other languages, let alone in languages that have been dead for thousands of years. It's even less of a good sign that you can do so without pausing in your reading for more than the moment or two it takes to locate a fresh source of caffeine.  You might want to have this looked into before the nice young men in the clean white coats come for a visit.

The felt slipper in the glass case looks somewhat worn and dusty, but still serviceable. Hence the shock of its caption — which reveals that its owner once pounded the Silk Road, the great ancient trade route, more than 1,000 years ago.      The Tibetan shoe, dating from the 8th or 9th century, is among a wealth of astonishingly well-preserved treasures from the Silk Road which have just gone on show at the British Library in central London.      Running from modern-day Iran to the west through central Asia and into China, with branches into Tibet and South Asia, the Silk Road — a series of trading routes rather than a single highway — saw commodities such as fabrics, spices and precious stones carried along its length.      More importantly for historians, with their passage came a transfer of ideas, technologies and beliefs.      Much of the route, especially that lying in what is now far-western China, is arid desert, meaning that a huge amount of usually perishable materials such as papers and fabrics have survived the centuries, often buried in sands.      The British Library's exhibition is largely drawn from items discovered by famous Hungarian-born explorer Marc Aurel Stein, who trekked along the Silk Road a number of times between 1900 and 1930. [ urlLink continue ]   The exhibition mixes such treasures with many objects and documents giving a taste of ordinary people's lives along the great trade route,  One letter, found in Sogdiana, in modern-day Uzbekistan, was written by an angry woman to a husband who had abandoned her, forcing the woman to work as a servant for a Chinese household.

"We knew that when she died, that would be it for moutarde violette — unless we started making it again," he said.

Inner city residents in Stavanger, Norway (population 108,000) have transformed a whole street into a permanent ‘social space’ by furnishing it with benches, tables, a pergola, potted plants, a notice-board, wiring for those who want to sit in the street with their computers and surf the internet and a flagpole (a flag is hoisted on the pole to celebrate residents' birthdays).      It all started one day when Trond Sigvaldsen took his father's garden bench out in the street to give it a polish, taking with him his newspaper and a coffee flask. People started to gather around his bench for a chat. So, they thought, why not make the whole of Vikesdalsgata street into an open air living room?      Having first knocked on doors to get the agreement of all the residents, they spent tedious months negotiating with local authorities and then more months furnishing their new dwelling space.      The launch took place in the spring of 1999 and nowadays the street has become something of an attraction for surrounding neighbourhoods. The improvements are much appreciated by the elderly waiting for their buses and by school pupils in their lunch hours.  urlLink Bonkers Book Collecting   From The Telegraph:  urlLink The bizarre world of bonkers book collecting.

      Two Links from  urlLink Serge :    urlLink Forgotten Christians:     Not all displaced Palestinians are Muslims!    At the time of the creation of the Israeli state in 1948, it is estimated that the Christians of Palestine numbered some 350,000. Almost 20 percent of the total population at the time, they constituted a vibrant and ancient community; their forbears had listened to St. Peter in Jerusalem as he preached at the first Pentecost. Yet Zionist doctrine held that Palestine was “a land without a people for a people without a land.” Of the 750,000 Palestinians that were forced from their homes in 1948, some 50,000 were Christians—7 percent of the total number of refugees and 35 percent of the total number of Christians living in Palestine at the time.  In the process of “Judaizing” Palestine, numerous convents, hospices, seminaries, and churches were either destroyed or cleared of their Christian owners and custodians. In one of the most spectacular attacks on a Christian target, on May 17, 1948, the Armenian Orthodox Patriarchate was shelled with about 100 mortar rounds—launched by Zionist forces from the already occupied monastery of the Benedictine Fathers on Mount Zion. The bombardment also damaged St. Jacob’s Convent, the Archangel’s Convent, and their appended churches, their two elementary and seminary schools, as well as their libraries, killing eight people and wounding 120. --- Following the incremental atrophy of leftist ideals, the Islamists are seen as the only ones who are willing and able to fight the occupation. The Lebanese Hezbollah, widely seen as a nonsectarian organization that is able to cooperate with people of all faiths, is particularly admired both among the refugees in Lebanon as well as those who remain in Palestine.  “We have received far more support and comfort from the Hezbollah in Lebanon than from our fellow Christians in the West,” remarked one Christian Palestinian refugee in Damascus. “I want to know, why don’t the Christians in the West do anything to help us? Are the teachings of Jesus nothing but empty slogans to them?”   This is a justified and important question, but the answer is not straightforward. The Catholic Church has, in fact, long argued for an end to the Israeli occupation and for improvement of the Palestinians’ situation. The leaders of the Eastern Orthodox churches have taken similar, often more strongly worded positions.  ---  Christians find themselves under the hammer of the Israeli occupation to no less an extent than Muslims, yet America—supposedly a Christian country—stands idly by because its most politically influential Christians have decided that Palestinian Christians are acceptable collateral damage in their apocalyptic quest. “To be a Christian from the land of Christ is an honor,” says Abbas, a Palestinian Christian whose family lived in Jerusalem for many generations until the purge of 1948. “To be expelled from that land is an injury, and these Zionist Christians in America add insult.”  Abbas is one of the handful of Palestinian Christians that could be described as Evangelical, belonging to a group that appears to be distantly related to the Plymouth Brethren. Cherishing the role of devil’s advocate, I had to ask him, “Is the State of Israel not in fact the fulfillment of God’s promise and a necessary step in the second coming of Christ?” Abbas looked at me briefly and laughed. “You’re kidding, right? You know what they do to our people and our land. If I thought that was part of God’s plan, I’d be an atheist in a second.”    urlLink Please Me, O Lord  :  S.M.

      It is said that in the old days, Chinese civil servants would avoid certain places at different points in their lives:   When you are young, avoid Szechwan - the food is spicy and makes you crazy. When you are young, avoid Shanghai and Keangsoo (Jiangsu) - the girls are pretty, and you will never leave. When you are old, avoid Canton - the food is good and the weather warm, you will never want to return north.   Just goes to show that the south has it far better than the barbaric north, and they knew it even back then!

      Had dinner with cutie friend Eric last night, whom I haven't really talked to in over a year - since I went back to England last March, to be precise. It was nice catching up. He's decided he wants to watch Troy now, for comic value. Ha!  Brought dad to the dentist this morning.  If there's anything good about the Troy film, it's that I'm now motivated to read the  Iliad . Not that I've not studied bits and pieces here and there and suchlike, but I've never actually read it from cover to cover... Well, I've read it in an English translation, but that doesn't really count cos translations are for wimps. I've got here a parallel English-Greek edition (Loeb, of course) and I'm ploughing my way through the Greek, with the English on the side for help if I get stuck (this is Homeric Greek, some 500 years before the period I specialise in).   So I started on Monday... It's now Tuesday afternoon and I'm in the middle of Book V already.   One line struck me:          ἀλλ' οὔ πως ἅμα πάντα θεοὶ δόσαν ἀνθρώποισιν     But in no wise do the Gods grant to men all things at one time.  How very true. I shall have to remember that one for future use.  They say I have a messy workspace. It is now nearly Ascension (that's Thursday, to be exact), and the assorted music from Holy Week and Easter is still lying on my desk. Perhaps it'll get cleared by Christmas. After all, the music for last Christmas is STILL HERE.

      From  urlLink Boing Boing : "Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water," is a documentary on Klingon-speakers debuting in Cannes. In conjunction with the release, the Klingon Language Institute is holding a workshop/confernece at Cannes for interested parties.      KLI members featured in the film include Dr d'Armond Speers, a linguist who spoke only in Klingon to his son until age three and a half, and Rich Yampbell, composer of Klingon national anthem taHaj wo.  And people call Greek and Latin useless languages? HELLO???  Here is where I display my geek feathers - I actually know a few words and phrases of klingonaase (that's what it's called)... even though I identify as a Romulan in conventions and when gaming... I'm a Trekkie of sorts after all.   Here's a useful klingonaase insult - tokhe straav', which means "willing slave", the worst insult in the language. If you ever see a klingon, don't say that to him unless you want an axe cleaving your skull.   Wait, I don't believe I actually said "if" in that previous sentence, as if it could ever happen...

      from  urlLink Boing Boing : I don't know what to make of this. It's a very well-researched, non-hysterical collection of 50 seeming contradictions in the Berg decapitation video. The author states that a number of these will likely be explained away, but taken as a whole, this very convincingly implies that Berg was not killed by the terrorists that the CIA fingered, and may, in fact, have been killed by westerners.  15) Orange jumpsuit Berg shown in video wearing orange jumpsuit known to be of U.S. issue. The orange jump suit "appears" to be identical to the jumpsuits used at Guantanamo. (Compare with pictures at Guantanamo.) The orange jumpsuit was standard US military issue to men in custody. It is unlikely Berg would continue wearing a U.S. custodial uniform if he had been released by the military as they claim. The fact he was still wearing the suit is both anomalous and suggestive. One wonders: Was there an immediate transfer of Berg from the US military to unknown persons, preventing Berg from discarding his US prison garb?  16) No blood at decapitation When Berg is decapitated, there was almost no blood. If Berg were still alive at this point, with the cut starting at front of throat, blood would have been spraying everywhere. Berg's severed head, the floor, Berg's clothes, and even the hand of the 'Arab' who decapitated Berg had no visible blood on it. When the executioner holds up Berg's head immediately following what is represented as an actual decapitation of a living person, there is no significant blood flow from the neck or blood splatters showing anywhere on the executioner.  17) Berg did not move Berg seems limp just before the beheading. It is not clear if he was moving after the time skip in the tape. While on the ground, Berg's body didn't seem move except in response to the captors movements. Although held down, Berg would have tried to instinctively wiggle and writhe away from captor's grip and use of a knife. (That is unless he was long dead after the cut in the tape.) A surgeon would very likely testify that the beheading did not cause the death.  18) Berg may have been dead just before beheading The lack of spurting blood and lack of movement suggests Berg was already dead at the time of the alleged decapitation. During the beheading, Berg's eyes are not seen. Camera angle made it impossible to see if Berg's eyes were open or glassy. Berg very probably was killed before the staged beheading. Did the captors have no stomach for the beheading of a living person?  19) Straight cut on the neck The cut on Berg's neck seems to be too straight to have been done crudely and with such speed by a man wielding a large knife. Anybody who has carved a turkey knows there is something wrong with the supposed beheading. The suspended head looks more like Berg had been neatly beheaded by a guillotine.   35) White hands of "terrorists" Some of the "Arab terrorists" have pasty-white hands and (other exposed) skin. One would be hard pressed to find Arab men with pasty-white hands.  36) Wrong accent Al-Zarqawi is/was Jordinian. Arab linguists have said the man posing as Al-Zarqawi did not speak with a Jordanian dialect. Others have suggested the man reading the written statement may not have been a native speaker of Arabic....  42) Gold ring on killer's hand The man in the videotape who is purported to be Zarqawi seems to be wearing a gold ring. Note: This is a questionable point. To quote Healing Iraq (healingiraq.blogspot.com) as quoted at this angryfinger.org post ( urlLink Nick Berg Conspiracy Theories Abound ): "Islam does not specifically forbid that men wear gold, in fact the Quran and the Hadith have encouraged men to 'adorn' and 'embellish' themselves (dying hair, perfume, etc.) .... the practice of wearing gold ornaments is discouraged by Muslim clerics, "Gold is the ornament of women". Socially it is not acceptable in the Arab world for men to wear gold, although this has changed lately and many young men do (engagement and wedding rings are mostly gold)."

         Watched this film last night with a bunch of friends. At the end of it, I heard some girls going "wah, you mean it's based on a book?". Lady Athena give me strength...  WARNING: Rant ahead. This one's LONG. I don't usually post ultra-long reviews of films like this, but being a Classicist, I've taken this desecration of Homer personally.  What do you get if you start with the first great narrative of Western civilization, then remove all the psychological complexity and profound characterization?     Troy    If you're someone to whom "Homer" means only the stupidest character on  The Simpsons , this may not be off-putting. If you think the Bronze Age began when Brad Pitt's tanning bed was delivered, you may not care. And if you know Trojans only as impediments to procreation, Wolfgang Petersen's grandiose, hollow war film may seem like gold. The rest of us may wish he'd plunged head-first into Homer's wine-dark sea and stayed under.    This Iliad purist doesn't know where to start. Let's try starting with the time-frame. Writer David Benioff compressed 10 years of battle into 17 days (I counted) and ignored significant characters.   From the very beginning, where the historical preamble of text explaining the "background" gets shown, I started shifting in my seat. "Greeks and Trojans" they said. Now, even though in English we tend to think of the war as having been between Greeks and Trojans, here wasn't such thing as "Greece" in the times the Trojan Wars took place. "Greece" was a bunch of city-states, led by more or less independent kings: Sparta (Menelaus), Mycenae (Agamemnon), Ithaca (Odysseus), Phthia (Achilles) etc... Those people, by the way, called themselves Achaeans most of the time, and that's what Homer calls them. "Greeks" doesn't appear in the  Iliad  at all. Agamemnon neither conquered nor unifed Greece. Greece was still a collection of loosely allied kingdoms at the time of the Trojan War. The Greek kings fought to get Helen back because they had all wanted to marry her and pledged each other that they would defend the one who won her hand against any tried to take her away, not because they owed Agamemnon fealty.   First the men. The cast's Achilles heel is its Achilles, who ought to be a heel: arrogant, lazy, stubborn, cruel, deceitful and foolish. Homer created Western literature's first anti-hero in this demigod, upon whom the Greeks' hopes rest despite his long reluctance to fight Trojans. Pitt turns him into a simple, sullen rebel against Greek leader Agamemnon, a generically stolid warrior who wonders in the best tradition of the 20th century crap: "what's all the killing for?" He comes to life only in sword-to-sword combat with Trojan prince Hector (an excellent Eric Bana). The rest of the time, even in bed with the captive Briseis, this Achilles is as wooden as the Trojan horse. Achilles also declines to join his friend Patroclus in bed. Patroclus is his  "beloved cousin"  rather than, as Shakespeare so piquantly put it,  "his masculine whore."  And, just to dispel that expectation from the start, our very first view of Achilles finds him in bed with TWO babes. When Achilles bedded Briseis, my friend  urlLink Anthony  very evilly commented,  "I hope he's using a Trojan!"    Stupid filmmakers have changed the key to Patroclus' death - in the  Iliad , Achilles tells Patroclus to lead the Myrmidons, and is thus responsible for his lover's death. A pity Hollywood didn't have the guts to show Achilles' bisexuality. Would Pitt's female fans still have come to watch a near-naked Brad Pitt getting it on with some guy? Sure, why not? It's not like he's ever going to get it on with most of them anyway. I'll be posting about the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus soon - I'll reread the  Iliad  and come up with some ideas.    Is it my imagination or is Pitt's designer leather skirt about four inches shorter than everyone else's? Pitt also poses his way through the film. He preens, he prances and he pouts. And when he summons his men in to battle it is with an accent that knows no location on earth. It has a tinge of the British in it so maybe that is where he was aiming. But he doesn't hit that target. His cry outside the walls of Troy -  "Heck-tah! HECK-TAH!"  sounded like a  "can Hector come out and play, Mr Priam?" .  No wonder Hector didn't look too worried.  Achilles, who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix-like powers, utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem, has been turned into "Fabio on the beach" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced). I must say though, he did look really good with his shirt off, especially the scene where he was conveniently covered in vaseline.    They've removed the importance of Shield Brothers and gotten rid of, surprise surprise, the importance Patroclus has in Achilles' rampage. No idea what I'm talking about? Patroclus and Achilles were lovers, or at the very least, the dearest of "bosom friends" and shield brothers.   At the root of the film's troubles is the Petersen's biggest miscalculation: leaving out the gods. Though the Gods are referred to obliquely, the film keeps them firmly out of sight and mind - the implication being that they aren't there at all. It's Homer as secular humanist.  But the Gods are what make the  Iliad  so grand. To tell the story of Troy without the back story of the Judgment of Paris, for example -- in which the handsome prince is forced to pick between the goddesses Aphrodite, Hera and Athena by giving the most beautiful a golden apple -- is to suck the tale of its vigor. And when Paris challenges Helen's ex-husband, King Menelaus, to single combat and starts to lose, what a difference it makes for Paris to cower in terror and scurry away, as the film depicts, rather than have Aphrodite swoop down and spirit him away, as in Homer's version.   Lost in the translation is the vivacious, compelling tug of war between Gods and mortals. Sure, the Gods are immortal, but they miss out on the joy -- the excitement -- of being alive and knowing you have a finite time on this Earth. Homer's gods meddle, bicker, squabble and, in many ways, are less noble (and more fun) than the humans they try to push around. Even Homer's martial epic would best be subtitled, The Gods Must Be Crazy. In the  Iliad , the Gods are a meddlesome bunch -- Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite and the rest are always zipping down from Olympus to butt into human affairs. Homer would've had no story without them. There would have been no Trojan War because Helen would never have been abducted. Achilles, the story's hero -- and the son of a Goddess -- would have never been born.  Benioff and Petersen made a fatal mistake by excising the gods, who are mentioned vaguely but never interfere with the action. One points of the  Iliad  is that fate and the immortals rule us, despite our attempts to assert free will; we must be righteous partly because the Gods may end our lives at any time. Hector is Achilles' equal in the  Iliad , until the goddess Athena disguises herself as Hector's brother and betrays his trust.  It's vain Aphrodite, goddess of love, who gives the Spartan queen Helen to the Trojan prince Paris, as Helen's his reward for judging Aphrodite winner of a beauty contest.) This infuriates Helen's husband, Menelaus, who convinces his fellow kings of Greece to seek revenge. Without a sense of destiny and divine command behind them, Paris becomes a common seducer and Helen a cheap tart. (The smaller-than-life performances by Orlando Bloom and German actress Diane Kruger reinforce that impression.)  Oh, and what on earth is the temple of Apollo doing on the beach, outside the city walls? That's supposed to be the temple of Troy's patron god. What is this, San Apollo fuori-le-mure?  In just the first half hour of the film, most of the back-story of the Trojan War has been jettisoned. Gone is the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, where the shunning of Eris, the Goddess of Discord, sets the wheels of the Trojan War into motion. Gone are the twin prophets Cassandra and Helenus, who are the voices of reason of Troy. Gone is Hecuba (or Hecabe), the mother of Hector and Paris, who tries to stop her younger child from traveling to Sparta to act on his romantic impulses. Gone is Paris having been exiled from Troy at an early, due to a prophecy he would lead to the downfall of Troy. Gone is the fact that Paris not only stole Menelaus’ wife but much of his wealth as well. Gone is Menelaus calling upon all of Helen's old suitors, who made an oath long before that they would all back Helen's husband to defend her honour. Gone is Agamemnon having to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to Artemis(the twin sister of Apollo) in order to secure safe passage on the oceans to travel to Troy. Actually, much more of the story has been shuffled off, including a lengthy battle against the Teuthranians, whom the Greeks originally thought took Helen, since Menelaus was away at a funeral when Helen was squired away, but who needs all that rich texture when you only have 165 minutes to tell your story, and you wasted the first fifteen setting your hero up as the Grecian Fabio meets Han Solo?   Achilles never really gets a scratch on him even though he is in the thick of a battle full of spears and swords, never mind that he is not revealed to be the son of a Goddess or wearing armor forged by the Gods. He is only a mere mortal here. For anyone who read the poems or is familiar with the stories, there is too much missing.    THE MOST POIGNANT PART OF THE STORY WAS CHANGED!   I'm talking about Book 6 where Hector says goodbye to his family... why oh why did they change that?! Go read the Iliad, and you'll see what I mean.   What's left? Not mythology, to be sure, but a rather bland sociology lecture on the realpolitik of power and the human waste of war. Now, such a contemporary sermon is well and good, but ancient Greece ain't the place to preach it. Also, there's carnage, accomplished over and over with the best computer-generated images money can buy. We're treated to at least four funeral pyres and countless scenes of slaughter, which achieve tension and emotional resonance only when a few great foes go one-on-one.   So they've removed the Gods and all hint of the supernatural, but it also includes a reference to Achilles’s heel, which, in the absence of the gods, is merely a payoff with no setup. Traditionally, Achilles's prowess is the result of his mother dipping him in the river Styx’s Invulnero-Water, since the water makes invincible whatever bodypart it touches; but since she held him by foot, his heel didn't get the treatment. Also, Paris is given a vision from Athena where she practically holds up a sign pointing to Achille's heel saying "AIM FOR THIS SPOT". Let's not forget Apollo, who's pretty pissed at the Achaeans for having violated his sanctuary and priests, guided the arrow of Paris to Achilles' heel.   Without that having been established, the crucial arrow to Achilles' heel makes us think, "Right. The heel. I remember that. What exactly was it about?" The scene's inclusion is therefore a stupid loose thread left dangling after the story was trimmed and re-hemmed, and his thrashing around when he is hit in his hamstring with an arrow after he has suffered far stronger blows to the rest of his body becomes almost comical.  And what the hell is Achilles doing taking part in the taking of Troy? He's dead LONG before that happens in Homer.    urlLink Anthony  pointed out quite correctly that the Iliad is about Gods and heroes. This film has humanised the heroes and eliminated the Gods. Epic is about heroes, not humans. It's perhaps unfair to expect contemporary Hollywood moviemakers to do justice to Homer or the legends of the Trojan War that have inspired artists and writers through the centuries. It is definitely unfair to expect Hollywood moviemakers to be comfortable with any notion of honour, even though the behavior of classical heroes like Achilles and Hector is inexplicable without it. However,  Troy  goes to the other extreme: Belief in the Gods is shown to be absurd, and whenever a character invokes them, he is making a ludicrous mistake.  As a result, the film lacks any sense of fate, destiny or even why this war's heroes should be memorable. Troy takes all the wind out of Homer's sails. This is an epic made by a modernist who doesn't believe in epics. Doesn't believe in the honour of battle, or the status of a tragic hero, or the ideal of romantic love, or the dictates of an omnipotent god.  It's OK to create a political explanation for the Greek expedition, making punishment for Helen's abduction a convenient cover story for Agamemnon's imperial ambitions. But without honor as a primary concern, Achilles' fury at Agamemnon for taking away his lawful prize, the priestess Briseis, doesn't really make any sense.  There's a movingly human scene in the Iliad, one of the most beautiful and noblest scenes from the poemin which Glaucus and Diomedes stop fighting to exchange their armours as a gesture to the ties of hospitality that binds the two. Homer considered Diomedes so important that an entire book of the  Iliad  is dedicated to him. Unfortunately that scene is absent because they've completely eliminated Diomedes and regal warrior Aeneas does only marginally better -here he's a Trojan teen in a toga who speaks one line.)  Agamemnon (Brian Cox) sniggers that the foolish Helen has "proved to be very useful"— and he must have fought the urge to stroke his beard like Ming the Merciless. His pettiness cheapens the character's shrewd intelligence. Cox goes so over-the-top as a thoroughly evil Agamemnon that you wonder if he isn't deliberately sabotaging the movie. His performance raises an interesting question: Which is harder to watch, a talented actor giving a performance way below his game, or a really dreadful actor demonstrating for all time his utter lack of talent?  If "Troy" doesn't put an end to the movie career of Orlando Bloom, there is no justice in movieland. Could somebody remind Bloom that we are in the Homeric Age - not Middle Earth - when using the Bow he morphed into Legolas. All I needed was an Cave Troll to come up and smite the Greeks. After he kills Achilles with an arrow, I was half expecting a voice from below to shout,  "that still only counts as one!" . Please, Bloom... change professions. You should not be allowed to act, legally. I am amused by the thought that teenage girls might actually buy a copy of the Iliad, perhaps hoping to find an insert with pictures of him. There was that bit when Paris and King Priam are looking at the Horse (it's hideous) left behind by the Greeks, and Bloom comments "burn it, father". I couldn't help thinking "oh, he HAS to be gay... he has taste".   Sean Bean makes a canny and trustworthy Odysseus of Sparta, although even Cecil B. DeMille himself might have resisted the scene in which the character sees a soldier carving a wooden toy horse and -- say! -- the light bulb goes on over his head. And Australian actor Eric Bana thoroughly atones for last summer's "The Hulk" with his performance as Hector, Paris's older brother and the most capable and most tragic figure in the entire saga.  The first major battle sequence, with Achilles and his hand-picked Myrmidons storming the Trojan beach, might be exciting if it weren't a flagrant carbon copy of the D-Day opener in "Saving Private Ryan." The final scenes, with Achilles searching the dying Troy for Briseis, suggest "Titanic." The large-scale battle scenes are impressive, but they suffer by comparison to those in Lord of the Rings (Peter Jackson has made it pretty difficult for directors of epic movies for the forseeable future). Then there's that scene where the Trojans set ablaze giant orbs of thatch and bowl them straight at the massed enemy. Scary it isn't, but you sure do want to sing along:  Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire!   Now the women. Diane Kruger's Helen. Ha. She's pretty in a sort of Californian High-School way, but no way would she be a woman for whom a thousand ships were launched. In the Iliad, it says when Helen is in Troy, two old guards catch sight of her and say "it is no shame that men should fight and die for such a beauty as this". I can't imagine that happening with Kruger, who seems to have wandered in from the next-door audition for Eastern European Bond girls.   I read somewhere Catherine Zeta-Jones was a possibility for Helen, and I can imagine a LOT more ships being launched for her. However, Bloom had already been cast as Paris and she would've looked too old for his consort.  Pity.   The movie's real erotic object is Pitt's Achilles, really. Just look at the number of times he slowly undresses and washes his body.  They've eliminated Cassandra the priestess. Cassandra was given her powers of prophecy by Apollo, who wanted to gain her favor, but after getting her powers she rejected him. Instead of taking back the powers, he cursed her to never have anyone believe her prophecies. When Hecabe was pregnant with Paris, she had a dream that she gave birth to a flame that destroyed Troy. Cassandra said that the child would destroy the kingdom and he should die. However, the dream was interpretted by someone else the same way, and Paris was taken to a mountain top and left to die of exposure. He was found instead, and raised as a shepherd. Later, when he came back to Troy, Cassandra recognized him and again warned them that he would bring the death of the kingdom. She attacked Helen upon arrival, again warning everyone, and again being unbelieved.  At the end of the trojan war, she warned the King that there was an army inside the wooden horse, but no one believed her then either.  the one with the gift of foresight. She knows what is going to happen, and that is why she tells the Trojans "beware of Greeks bearing gifts". It's one of the key lines of the  Iliad . POOF. Disappeared without a trace. During the sacking of Troy, she was captured by Ajax in the temple of Athena and raped, but since Ajax has been killed by Hector in the film...  Where is Hecuba, the Queen of Troy? They seem to have misplaced Priam’s 48 other sons and all 50 of his daughters. I understand that it would be extremely difficult to have them all, but they left out such key Trojan royals as Deiphobus, Polyxena and Cassandra. As I said, I understand leaving these characters for the sake of it being a complex story, but they’re not even  mentioned .   Helen. Helen was not sent to Sparta to marry Menelaus, she was the daughter of Leda and Tyndareus (previous king and queen of Sparta), her real father was Zeus which explained her beauty. She chose to marry Menelaus out of all the suitors in Greece and the alliance was made upon the suggestion of Odysseus that the suitors agree to join together and stand behind her choosen husband if his right to Helen is challenged .  Briseis? Briseis was not a cousin to the royal family nor was she a priestess of Apollo. Briseis was the wife of King Mynes of Lyrnessus, which was an ally of Troy's. According to mythology. Achilles sacked Lyrnessus, killing Briseis' husband and her three brothers. Achilles then took her as his prize, making her his concubine. He fell in love with her, and during the tenth year of the Trojan war, Agamemnon, decimated Thebes, taking Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo. Apollo got pissed when Agamemnon refused to give her back, and "came down from Olympus darker than night, though he is known as the 'bright one'; and shooting his golden arrows at the Achaean camp, he caused a plague that decimated the army."  Agamemnon was told by Calchas (the same prophet that told him to sacrifice his daughter) that the plague was created by Apollo's wrath over the pain of his priest. Agamemnon agreed to give back Chyrseis as long as another prize was provided to replace her. Achilles, hearing this ridiculed Agamemnon, calling him a schemer, and to punish him for this, Agamemenon took Briseis from Achilles. That is why Achilles refused to fight anymore until Patroclus was killed by Hector.   They've elevated Briseis' existence from chattel (and minor sub-point) to Trojan royalty and a love story. (For goddsakes! A love story!) I am so sick of stories of women who are enslaved and then fall in love with their captors/rapists/enslavers!   Hello, where are all those nutty left-wing liberals and feminists when you need them?   They have Briseis kill Agamemnon. Unbelievable. Oresteia, anyone? Hello? Clytemnestra - are you listening? 'cos if you are, you're going to be really happy... you don't have to kill your husband anymore! Your son doesn't have to come back to kill you anymore! Of all the wrecking of the myth, this is the WORST. This is SACRILEGE.  The very idea that Hollywood could so alter one of the greatest tales ever told to say that anyone but Clytemnestra killed Agamemnon is, to use an apt Greek word,  hubris . It's disgusting. The point that Agamemnon goes home to be killed by his wife Clytemnestra is the basis of the  Oresteia  - the cornerstone of Western Drama.  Benioff might as well make a giant 40 foot robot come in and kill him because, well, if he can change important events in the poem such as the DEATH OF THE KING OF THE MYCENAEANS, then adding a 40 foot robot bent on destruction shouldn't be a problem at all.     For such a high budget production, you would think they could have afforded to have Chryseis, Cassandra, and Briseis...  WITHOUT  bunging them together into one unlikely character! Briseis killed Agamemnon? No problem! She can stand-in for Clytaemnestra, after all, Briseis' character was standing in for virtually every female in the Iliad.   The film's entire female cast is basically just an elaborate background tool set up so that the men have a distraction when the battles have died down. This treatment of the women and the elimination of the homosexual love between Achilles and Patroclus makes the film the worst sort of Hollywood heterosexist whitewash imaginable.    I must remember this if I ever become a Classics teacher and give a test on the Iliad or Greek Mythology. I shall make sure to ask questions whose answers are very different in the book and flick - that way we'll see who did the reading!   "How does Agamemnon die?" (trick question)! That'll teach'em to read the text! No, he is not killed by Briseis!  What the movie doesn't explain is why Helen would leave with Paris after an acquaintanceship of a few nights. Is it because her loins throb with passion for a hero? No, because she tells him: "I don't want a hero. I want a man I can grow old with." Not in Greek myth, you don't. If you believe Helen of Troy could actually tell Paris anything remotely like that, you will probably also agree that the second night he slipped into her boudoir, she told him, "Last night was a mistake."  Hector tells Paris how he remembered when Paris was 10 years old. Hello... Wasn't Paris abandoned at Mt Ida, raised by a shepherd and later returned to Troy as prince?   Ajax was not killed by Hector, instead Ajax wounded Hector without sustaining an injury. Later he and Odysseus made speeches who of them should get Achilles' armor, and Odysseus won, so Ajax started killing his own people too after going berserk, and later he comitted suicide.  What is this nonsense about "the sword of Troy"? Aeneas didn't carry out the sword of Troy, he carried his father, led his son, and carried the statue of Troy (a goddess figure) according to the  Aeneid .   Patroclus was an accomplished warrior in his own right, not the untried boy presented in the movie. Patroclus, who looks a little like Achilles, wears his helmet and armor to fool the enemy, and until the helmet is removed everyone thinks that Achilles has been slain. So dramatic is that development that the movie shows perhaps 100,000 men in hand-to-hand combat, and then completely forgets them in order to focus on the Patroclus battle scene, with everybody standing around like during a fight on the playground.  Menelaus? He's supposed to survive the Trojan War and get back to Sparta promptly, where ten years years later he tells Telemachus all about his father (Odysseus). He is not supposed to die on the second day of the war.  By treating Achilles and the other characters as if they were human, instead of the larger-than-life creations of Greek myth, director Wolfgang Petersen miscalculates. What happens in Greek myth cannot happen between psychologically plausible characters. That's the whole point of myth. Great films like Michael Cacoyannis'   urlLink Elektra  , about the murder of Agamemnon after the Trojan War, know that and use a stark dramatic approach that is deliberately stylized. Of course,  Elektra  wouldn't work for a multiplex audience, but then maybe it shouldn't.  Then we've got the Trojan Horse itself. It’s a monstrous thing, hammered together out of ship planks, and painted a menacing black. Why anyone would bother hauling it home beats me. In Homer, the soothsayer of Trojans tried to warn King Priam that the horse was a danger but Poseidon sent his sea serpant to silence him, unlike the film where the soothsayer/priest was encouraging Priam to bring the horse into the city. Also would it have killed them to be a bit faithful to the script and show the horse so large that the Trojans had to demolish part of their city walls in order to bring the thing in?    Paris and Helen run off together at the end. I repeat - Paris and Helen run off together at the end. Excuse me? He's supposed to get mortally wounded and go crawling back to his first true love, the nymph Oenone on Mt Ida, whom he abandoned when Aphrodite promised him Helen. She has the power to heal him, but refuses to because he abandoned her. He dies right there and she is grief-stricken, etc. Paris hence dies long enough before the Greeks breach the city that Helen is married off to Deiphobus, another of Paris’s brothers. I was looking forward to Paris dying. But turns out that the writers changed it...grrr. They kill Brad and Eric, but they can't kill Orlando. Were the writers afraid that a few million teen Orli fans were gonna hurt them or something?  Helen is supposed to go with Menelaus, but since they've already killed him, she might as well go with the cute one, right? Andromache is supposed to be dragged off into slavery. Astayanax (Hector's teenaged son) is supposed to be hurled from the walls of Troy by Neoptolemus, Achilles' son. Aeneas' son Ascanius doesn't seem to exist in this movie, and how could he if his father is like, 15? Homer has Menelaus come into the palace at Troy, intending to kill her. As he finds her, Helen bares her bosom, and the beautiful sight affects Menelaus so much that he forgives her everything and brings her home. Of course, in the film, Menelaus died at the hands of Hector, so that couldn't happen...  The really bizarre thing about the script was that despite the listed inaccuracies, there were several things that only those well-read in the Classics would understand. For example, Thetis’s wandering around in the water for no real reason seems extraneous unless one understands that she was the daughter of a sea god. She also seems pointless unless one knows that it was her prophecy to Achilles that gave him the choice between a long life of obscurity and a short life of glory. Furthermore, at the end of the film, when several Trojans are fleeing to Mt Ida, Paris stops a teenage boy who is helping an old man to flee. Paris asks the boy what his name is, and he says "Aeneas."  Paris then hands him the "Sword of Troy", which as previously mentioned, if it is in the hands of a Trojan, Troy would never fall. Unless someone knows about the  Aeneid , etc, they wouldn’t get this reference, nor would they realize that the boy was basically carrying Anchises on his back. Never mind the actor playing Aeneas is actually 16, and therefore too young to be married to the eldest daughter of Priam and have a son. After all, do you really need Ascanius to rule Alba Longa for 30 years? Nah.  Imagine a movie based on the Bible without Christ, angels, or miracles. Or Lord of the Rings without magic or wizards. Imagine the Titanic taking its maiden voyage down to the French Riviera in late July, where the only ice to be seen for miles and miles were the ones the bartenders were putting into the drinks. Imagine Frodo and Sam reaching the Cracks of Doom in a week by taking a little known short cut that does not appear on any map of Middle-earth. That’s about the level of change made in adapting the  Iliad  to the screen, and that is simply unacceptable. I can't figure out why they made so many of the changes they did. They're not little details by any means, and saying that it's not supposed to be the  Iliad  doesn't excuse the fact that the story goes against every source of myth related to the war, not just the  Iliad .    "Don't look now, dudes, but there're, like, a thousand ships outside. But never fear. The pecs of Troy -- um, princes of Troy -- are ready."  They also show plenty of male flesh. Granted, it was nice to see lots of splendid muscles from Pitt and Bana, but did Petersen really have to desecrate the Iliad in order to do that? Couldn't he have made a film about bodybuilders or competitive swimmers instead?    Adaptation of the  Iliad ? Perhaps  rape  would be more appropriate.  Some things that really got to me: the pronunciation of names. Yes, I understand that in Latin,  Priam  is pronounced  Pree-ahm, —that one I could accept, but they did some odd things with the other names:  Briseis  is now  Bri-say-iss  and Menelaus is now  Meneh-louse .   MUSIC   Unmemorable. Horner, who's done fabulous work elsewhere, gives an eminently forgettable score here. It's one of those "we can tell the Greeks are about to appear because the music's changed and the drums have started" sort of soundtracks. Plus, epic films have epic soundtracks and themes. Doctor Zhivago had "Laura's Theme", for example. If I'm not humming the theme or theme song as I leave the cinema, it's not an epic soundtrack. Way too much "aaAAAaaaaaAAAhhhh" music going on. Easily his worst soundtrack in 20 years.   SET & COSTUMES   Despite all the technology and GCI battle scenes, the biggest problem with Troy is a simple filmmaking 101 blunder: If a period picture wants to seduce an audience into suspending disbelief, a director must create not just a physical world, but an emotional one as well. In recent flicks such as The Last Samurai, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there's the sensation that we've happened upon a fully realised universe that was buzzing and thriving long before the camera crew stopped by. But for all his eye-popping set pieces, Troy still feels phony. Everyone seems to have just shown up that morning- nothing about the landscape looks lived-in. The costumes are all shiny and brand-new, the actors even shinier and prettier. The armour everyone's wearing looks like they took it out of the plastic wrap right before they jumped off the ships - either that or polishing armour is part of the ritual of preparing for war (it's not).  Is it just me or does Achilles' armour look like it's from a mail-order fetish catalogue? According to the  Iliad , his armour was forged by the great god Hephaestus. And with today's amazing special effects that are obviously available in Hollwood and used elsewhere in the film... it's not much to ask for the armor to LOOK somewhat impressive if not god-forged. The armour of the period is quite extensively described by Homer, bronze breastplates with silver and tin and enamel ornamentation, bronze greaves etc. The stuff they're wearing in the film looks like leather and moulded plastic. Of course they couldn't have their actors jumping around in heavy bronze breastplates because they're bloody heavy (those ancients were made of sterner stuff than our modern men) but they could have made an effort to make it look less cheap! After all, this film did have a budget of $200 million!   Which brings me to the costumes. I suspect they must have run out of money at this point (the film ended up wildly over-budget and over-schedule), because if you look closely, the nobles of Troy are all wearing tie-tyed cotton fabrics in white and blue. One can even spot where the knots and rubber bands were tied. Somebody please tell the costumer that bright blue and white tie-dye belongs in 70s California in hippie-settlements, not the world of Homer.   The Greek kings all look like old bikers. In fact, the Greeks look pretty much like every OTHER people trying really hard to look like Greeks. They're kind of a cross between Minoans, Medieval Europeans, and Vikings. It's a sad day indeed when the Greeks aren't Greek. One of the gang I watched the film with commented that the Greeks looked more like Dwarves from LOTR.    HISTORICAL DETAIL   There were more Greeks in one scene of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" than there are in the entirety of "Troy." In keeping with the Eisenhower era-style casting, the rank-and-file Greek army -- you know, the nameless barbarians who get brutally slaughtered -- has a few guys who look as if they might be of Italian or Middle Eastern descent. I read somewhere the extras were Bulgarians (rather pissed off at being paid $12 USD a day). What's the point of having some actors spout Greek in the big crowd scenes? I definitely heard a "Malista" somewhere.   The swords in the film are made of steel - and definitely not bronze. WHY IN ZEUS’ NAME IS THERE IRON IN THE BRONZE AGE? There's a reason this age is called the BRONZE AGE - they didn't have iron or steel tools yet.   Further nitpick - why do all these sword dramas feel the need to have the sound effecty "kkkssssszzzing" when a sword is drawn from the scabbard? I've worked with all sorts of swords and NOT ONE ever makes that sort of sound.    I have to laugh at the celebration around the wooden horse. Of course, the Trojan women are doing a Mayim step (that’s an ancient Hebrew dance step. Enough said) And of course, there was a random guy doing backflips. Ah, movie cliché #987.  What on earth were llamas doing running around the streets of Troy? I know they filmed in Mexico or something, but what are South American animals doing in a market place in Asia Minor in in 1200 B.C.?   When praying, the characters of Troy are depicted as kneeling before the statues. They couldn't have had a historical or classical consultant on this film, as everyone knows the Ancient Greeks and Homeric heroes STOOD when they prayed - in the ancient "Orans" position of forearms raised, palms facing upwards when praying to the Olympians or palms down when praying to the Gods of the Underworld. They most certainly did not kneel.  While we're on the topic of religion in the film, in the scene when Hector and Paris return to Troy, as they're entering the great hall, one sees clergy milling about, presumably the priests of Apollo, who is patron of Troy. One knows they're meant to be clergy not because they're wearing funny clothes (pretty much everyone is in this film, aside from Pitt who seems to show more skin than clothes) but because they're wearing hats and holding golden staffs which are directly stolen from Greek Orthodox  CHRISTIAN  Bishops' vestments and regalia. The staffs they hold (called  Pateritsa ) are terminated by two serpents looking toward an orb surmounted by a cross - an example may be seen  urlLink here . The priests of Apollo are also wearing on their heads these tallish cylindrical hats covered with a black veil - they're called  Kamilavka  ( Kalmilavkion  in the singular) and are worn by Bishops, dignitaries and monks - a picture of a bishop wearing it and holding the serpent staff may be found  urlLink here .    What the hell, did they think Greek Orthodox = Greek Pagan?      THE SCRIPT   Oh, the script. Did director Wolfgang Petersen imagine that if his actors acted as though they were reciting Shakespeare, it would make the dialogue, which alternates among the pompous, the banal and the just plain dumb, sound like Shakespeare? When Paris, who's so gorgeous he could have played Helen, nuzzles the Spartan queen in her boudoir, she coos, "last night was a mistake," just like any soap opera star.   "You must be Hector,"  says Achilles, on their first meeting. Ouch.  "Burn Troy Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn Troy to the ground!" screams Agamemnon during the sack of Troy. HA.  Benioff's script tries so hard to be high-flown and solemn that it ends up funny. The speech is hokey enough that hearing it once almost induces groans. Hearing it over and over and over again, as we do here, ensures groans. Enough with the immortality business, already! A lethal drinking game could be crafted from the number of times the script solemnly refers to "immortality", just as it could for the number of times that Pitt strikes a body-builder's pose as horns in the soundtrack adore him.  We also get countless speeches about how  "the world will never forget this war/our glory/your bravery/the mighty sword of blah-blah-blah."  If you took a drink each time someone said one, you'd be snockered halfway through.  "Immortality, take it, it's yours,"  Even our great warrior signs on. He sings a chorus of the pathetic blues (seems his Achilles heel is really just a bad case of angst), and then gives the sad song a positive spin:  "The gods envy us. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed."    How can I take Achilles seriously after hearing him utter the line  "It's too early in the day for killing princes” ? That and the  Rules of Epics , which require all critical death scenes to occur in Act 3. Bana's Hector has his moments, too.  A couple of times, by the expression on his face, I thought he was going to go green, you know,  Hulk out .   Hector Smash! Don’t make Hector angry Achilles. You won't like him when he’s angry.”  Orlando Bloom elicited a big laugh from me when he swept Helen into his arms and vowed  "We'll live off the land. I'll kill deer and rabbits,"  or something to that effect.   Though, I don’t think it was supposed to be funny.   David Benioff’s adaptation is laced with the dialogue of a angsty teenager who never studied the classical works. One of Agamemnon’s men says  “if we turn back now, we’ll lose all credibility”.  How about some poetry to the language?  REWRITE:  “If we turn a blind face, the four winds will spread our cowardice to every corner of Greece.”   That’s a centuries-old epic I can buy, not crap like  “I want to see my son grow old and have girls chasing him.”  The film needs  “my eyes want to look upon my son, bathing in all the flavour that life has to offer,”  not  “May the Gods be with you.”   That last line is not made up and one which even George Lucas would admit sucked.    Menelaus:  "Where is she?"  Guard:  "Sir, your wife left ... with the Trojans."    One would assume that a $200 million summer blockbuster could have found space on the payroll for some random lackey to comb the script and extricate any errant one-liners that could be potentially misconstrued as silly condom jokes by annoyed, impatient audiences. It calls to mind a quote from the estimable film critic Homer Simpson: "Your movie is more boring than church." I believe neither Homers would approve.  In an  urlLink interview , Benioff recently said, "This is the mother of all epics, the cornerstone of Western literature. If I screw it up, classicists around the world will issue a fatwa and assassinate me with bronze daggers."  He'd better be borrowing Brad's protective armour then. If I were in the mafia, I would seriously start a vendetta against those who allowed this film to see the light.    Please just pretend like you read the Iliad before you make a screenplay. This goes beyond interpretation (read: O Brother Where Art Thou? Now that's an excellent interpretation of the Odyssey!), this whole movie entered in to Classics heresy. The whole "inspired by" is nonsense. We wouldn't have people giving that argument if the story was of a character whose name was Jesus Christ, who was from Nazareth, parents were Mary and Joseph and instead of being crucified, instead he was whisked away by a gang of robbers, and he ends up becoming an alcoholic, womanizer and a gang leader and comes back and destroys the Roman Civilization. A director could easily put a disclaimer at the end saying "Inspired by the Life of Jesus Christ", but we all know what would happen then.  But yet, respected Classicist  urlLink Mary Beard  says:  Among those of us [professional classicists] who look on, a few will be curmudgeonly carping at inaccuracies or misrepresentations of the original. The majority will welcome the publicity for their subject. Many (myself included, I should confess) will already be penning articles on the "Pittian Moment In the Reception of The Iliad" or devising new courses on "Classics in Film" or "The Trojan War in Popular Culture". The chances are that Troy will have a longer life in a university department near you than in your local multiplex."  and ironically, she's right.  If they had done a good job, I perhaps could have had a sequel to look foward to. Now I fear it. The only good sign I saw in the whole bloody film was that they killed enough main characters (in the wrong way), that perchance they can't attempt to ruin my beloved Odyssey, Aeneid and Oresteia, right? Plus, no Gods and monsters means the Odyssey and Oresteia can't be made by them right? Oh Zeus. I hope so.  If you really want to experience Troy as it should be, go out and get a translation (I recommend Lattimore or Lombardo's versions), and read it for yourself. Better yet, learn Homeric Greek and read the original. If you want to actually see it...might as well wait for the rentals to come out (if I ever buy this on DVD it'll be as a comedy). If you want to see really hot men go naked (forgot how many times I almost jumped at the screen seeing Brad Pitt and Bana), then by ALL means, do go and watch it. As for the $200 million spent... all down the drain. If you want to see a comedic adaptation of Iliad without being too offended, then gooo ahead and watch. I thought the movie was hilarious. It shouldn't have been, but it was. Every time they screwed up, I just burst out laughing. Especially at Bloom's Paris  . Because honestly...    In the Odyssey, Homer calls Odysseus   "ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθ' ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμὸν ἀνδρω̂ν τε πτολέμους ἀλεγεινά τε κύματα* πείρων, δὴ τότε γ' ἀτρέμας εὑ̂δε, λελασμένος ὅσσ' ἐπεπόνθει.   one who in time past had suffered many griefs at heart in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves; but now he slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered. " (Odyssey, 13.90)  Now, taking a cue from Odysseus, I'm going to have a nap. Hopefully when I get up, I won't be so angry.

      Just a few links from  urlLink Lew Rockwell  to clear my "to-blog" list before I give my review of TROY.    urlLink The Abuse of the Politically Incorrect  : Steven Yates on the academy and beyond.  The most recent justification for the domination of academia by leftists is that "liberals are smarter." This was actually said by Robert Brandon, chair of the philosophy department at Duke University,  urlLink in a statement replete with logical fallacies . Example: "most stupid people are conservative," he said, clearly intending us to infer that "most conservatives are stupid." That is like arguing from  all dogs are mammals  to  all mammals are dogs  (the formal fallacy is called  illicit conversion ). Such is academia in 2004: comparable not so much to a sinking ship as to a train in free fall, having gone off an unseen cliff.   urlLink Stop Sympathizing With the Savage  : Joseph Sobran on  The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding , by Robert Hughes. Sometimes civilized men commit savage crimes; but savages commit them as a matter of course. This is no reason to belittle the difference between civilization and savagery. It’s a reason to keep trying to improve civilization. Sympathy for the alien can be noble, if it presupposes sympathy for one’s own. But as Robert Frost said, a liberal is one who won’t take his own side in a fight. “Nothing human is alien to me,” as the Roman said; but too many liberals seem alienated from the civilization to which they owe their being.   urlLink The Executioners Enjoyed Their Work  : Theodore Dalrymple on Original Sin and the veneer of civilization.  One thing that unites the men who beheaded the American Nick Berg in Iraq, the soldiers who abused Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib, the Palestinians who have held on to Israeli body parts in Gaza City and the murderers of Daniel Pearl in Pakistan is that they all enjoyed what they did, and enjoyed it immensely. There is almost no greater pleasure known to man than to commit great acts of cruelty in the belief that the cause of right and justice is being served. Anyone who has observed rioters will know that they are having a wonderful time: could there be a greater joy than vandalism with a social purpose?  ...Both self-examination and my experience of others tells me that evil lurks within all of us, waiting for its opportunity to spring. Civilisation may be a veneer, but it is the veneer that separates us from barbarism. Never forget Original Sin and its consequences.    urlLink Meet the 'Jackass' Generation  : by R. Cort Kirkwood  In Abu Ghraib prison, we reaped what we sowed. For years, we've preached egalitarian nonsense to our daughters. We sexualize them before puberty. We gorge them on rap and hip-hop. They get pierced like tribal Africans. We tell them to behave like boys, yet to resent and despise the male sex. Then Lynndie England shows up, and we profess utter shock. Or maybe we don't.  The men? They are "Jackass" Americans: hyperviolent and hypersexual. And stupid. We teach them that women, to quote a sociologist, are little men and that men are big women. We teach them that anything goes, even homosexual abuse. Nothing is right or wrong. Products of late-20th-century schools, they can't think for themselves.  Then again, neither can most Americans. That's how we got to Iraq.

       Ukraine's fabulous  urlLink Ruslana  has just won the Eurovision song contest, held this year in Constantinople (Istanbul, some seem to keep calling it). What's interesting about her music is that she tries to blend folk rhythms and styles with pop - and the result isn't tacky or cheesy as one would think... it works quite nicely. How does one describe her style? "Drive-Ethno-Dance" is what some might call it.   What's her music sound like? Some samples are available  urlLink here .

      This is a good thing ... someone in the press has recognized the graphically violent images which Homer presented:  What may surprise is that the oldest author in Western literature, Homer, was way ahead of Hollywood. Of all the great writers, Homer was perhaps the most cinematic. He writes like a movie camera: Written details play in our minds as if we were seeing them on a screen.      In Homer's Iliad, when the Trojan warrior Hector has killed one of his Achaean (Greek) enemies, he "planted a heel against Patroclus' chest, wrenched his bronze spear from the wound, kicked him over flat on his back."      That's cinematic.      Critic Roger Ebert talks about a movie cliché he calls the "fruit cart," when a falling kung-fu fighter or a careening car knocks over a table or fruit cart and spills produce all over the screen.      In Homer's Odyssey, the hero comes home to find his estate infested with villains. He kills them all, starting with the head bad-guy.       "Odysseus aimed and shot Antinous square in the throat with the arrow's point stabbing clean through to the nape of the neck and out the other side. Antinous pitched to the side, his cup dropped from his grasp as the shaft sank home, and the man's life blood came spurting from his nostrils in thick red jets. His foot jerked forward and kicked the table and food showered across the floor, bread and meat soaked in a swirl of bloody filth."       Fruit cart.      It is especially in the area of graphic violence that Homer anticipates Hollywood.      There was a time in movies when the bad guy got shot, grabbed his chest and keeled over. In 1967, Bonnie and Clyde turned death by gunshot into a slow-motion ballet of bodies jerked like marionettes punctuated by squibs popping like bubble wrap.      Since then, Hollywood has upped the ante, and the ballet of graphic gore has gotten more sophisticated, more precise and more messy. No one can be shot nowadays without a shower of blood spattering the wall behind him like spray paint.      In just 20 lines of the Iliad, Homer kills off half a dozen heroes in bloody style. Here's a sampling:       "Thrasymedes stabbed Antilochus right in the shoulder and cracked through the bony socket, shearing away the tendons. Then he wrenched the whole arm out and down thundered Antilochus and darkness blanked his eyes. . . .        "Peneleos hacked Lycon's neck below the ear and the sword sank clean through, leaving Lycon's head hanging on his body by only a flap of skin. The head swung wide and Lycon slumped to the ground. . . .      "Idomoneus skewered Erymas straight through the mouth, the spearpoint raking through, up under the brain to split his glistening skull, teeth shattered out, both eyes brimmed to the lids with a gush of red and both nostrils spurting, mouth gaping, blowing convulsive sprays of blood. He was a corpse as he hit the ground."       Tarantino is playing catch up. [from the  urlLink Arizona Republic ]

      It's a bit early for a commemoration of the Fall of Constantinople (Tuesday 29 May 1453) even by the Gregorian Calendar, but I found something on   urlLink Pensate Omnia   that was thought provoking:     During the early occupation of Constantinople, dishonourable Turkish soldiers killed, raped and sold thousands of Orthodox Christians to the slave markets of the east. Other soldiers searched through the houses of the wealthy finding extraordinary opulence and immense quantities of gold buried in their gardens. This hidden gold could have sustained the whole of Europe for many years.      The wealthy people of the city, paying homage to Sultan Mohammed II, instructed their children to present offerings of gold bars on trays. Mohammed II became very angry at this display of wealth asking, 'if you had so much gold, why did you not offer it to your Emperor when he asked for support to defend the Empire?' It was the rich who told the Emperor to "sell the Holy Chalices and other liturgical instruments, and use the gold of the Church to defend the Empire". Are these words repeated today in our churches?  [from an  urlLink article on repentance  ]  I think we all know the answer to that question.

       While washing your hands at the sink in the bathroom you start chanting Byzantine music (in Plagal of the Second tone), and -- all the sudden -- an ison starts coming from one of the stalls.

      While the main upmarket shopping area in Peking is 王府井Wangfujing (which I like to call by the rather quaint sounding translation "Well of the Princely Mansion"), where the masses shop is slightly to the west of 天安門 Tiananmen - 西單 Xidan. I walked the length of  Xidan one Saturday afternoon and evening - the numbers of people shopping is truly amazing. These people, not ten years ago, were bothering tourists to buy stuff for them from the Friendship Store (where better stuff not available to locals was sold), now have a whole series of gigantic shopping malls with a variety and quality of goods to match anything one can find in New York or London. It's a very obvious sign of how far the Chinese economy has come and how much the buying power of the Chinese consumer has improved - no wonder companies all around the world want to break into the Chinese market.  Peking alone has 14 million registered inhabitants (not including the 4 million from other bits of China working in Peking), about 2 million people coming and going daily. The numbers are staggering, really.   One of the chaps Dad and I had dinner with, the head of a Government department, had just signed a contract with some Portuguese firm. He was quite bemused to reflect that he had more employees in his department under his command than the total population of Portugal.  -   There's a fast-food noodle chain that's quite popular in Peking (and all over China), named  urlLink 美國加州牛肉面大王 。Literally translated, "America California Beef Noodle King". I kid you not. Personally, I've never heard of any such thing as "Californian Beef Noodle". None of their ingredients are particularly Californian or even American, and their menu is very typically that of a North-Chinese noodle place, with springrolls, meat buns and suchlike. It's as if a KFC clone opened up in San Francisco, named "Manchu Fried Chicken" but with a menu identical to that of KFC. When it first opened in 1998, Dad and I thought it was going to die a quick death, but it's doing a booming business, expanding and opening new outlets all the time. They're actually the Number 3 fast-food chain in China, after Mac's and KFC. I can't understand it myself. It must be the idea that somehow it's foreign (they claim foreign ownership) - the Chinese seem to adore anything foreign. [ urlLink English Website here ]  -  In 通州 Tongzhou, the suburb of Peking, where Dad and I were staying, we had lunch one day in a tiny hole-in-the-wall eatery off the main street. Szechwan cooking, it promised, and from the accent of the chap trying to get us to go on, it seemed the real McCoy. We had 宮保雞丁Chicken stir-fried with dried chillies (poetically called Throne-Protector Chicken, named in honour of the official for whom it was created), 回鍋肉 Refried Pork (literally Back-to-the-Wok Meat), 魚香茄子 Stir-Fried Aubergines/Eggplant (literally Fish-Fragrance Eggplant, don't ask) with lots of rice and tea. Bill came up to ¥21. That's about $4.50 Sing (about £1.50 or $2.50 USD). Needless to say, the food was excellent.

      A few weeks ago, I was waiting for my friend Graeme at a theatre, waiting to see a play. So alright, I had the handsfree attached to my mobile phone and awaiting for his call. He calls, and I press  ANSWER  on the phone. I put the phone to my ear and keep going " uh hello? "... because I can't hear anything. After about a minute, I give up and figure there's a problem on his side, so I then wait for him to call back. As I'm waiting I suddenly realise " hang on, of course there's no sound coming out of the phone speaker... " because the handsfree is attached... and the sound then should be coming out of the earphones... which I had sagely left hanging around my neck. I called Graeme back and told him what happened. " Oh my God, Ed, you're so joking " was his response. Classic moment really.

       urlLink   The site claims:      Basically, Gematria is searching for different patterns through the text, such as the amount of words beginning with a vowel. If the amount of these matches is divisible by a certain number, such as 7 (which is said to be God's number), there is an incontestable argument that the Spirit of God is ever present in the text. Another important aspect in gematria are the numerical values of letters: A=1, B=2 ... I=9, J=10, K=20 and so on. The Gematriculator uses Finnish alphabet, in which Y is a vowel.      Experts consider the mathematical patterns in the text of the Holy Bible as God's watermark of authenticity. Thus, the Gematriculator provides only results that are absolutely correct.

         YOUNG Chinese boys may soon cut a typically English pose on the Bund - Shanghai's promenade from the colonial period - in the first time since the 1950s that students will stroll along the waterfront in blazer and school tie.  English public schools are being drawn to China by the growing appetite for what is thought to be British style. Indulgent parents in a China whose economy is booming will lavish their 'young emperors' with the best of English education and at a fraction of the cost of sending them to England... If imitation is the greatest form of flattery, then Asians are paying the British the ultimate compliment.  The irony is that in Britain these days, British style is a blend of 'Estuary accents' and bhangra music. A distinctly multicultural Britain may find puzzling an Englishness whose last repository is along the Bund in Shanghai.   That's a fascinating article from the Straits Times- perhaps they might need an ethnically-Chinese teacher of Greek and Latin who speaks perfect English and is an Anglophile? One may hope...   It's an idea that appeals to me - for a long time I've wanted an excuse to spend extended periods in Shanghai, the city where my Mother was born and spent her childhood, living in the French concession, before the Communists came and our family fled.   Just think of it... me, in what was once called "the Wickedest City in the World"... teaching the Classics and eating fabulous Shanghainese food by day, and enjoying the opium-smoke suffused "Flower Quarter" by night. Ok, I know, opium is a horrible drug and it's impossible to find.. and that the Flower Quarter doesn't exist anymore... and that I'm neither interested in Flower Girls or drugs... it's just such a pretty picture that it appeals to me intellectually and aesthetically.   Of course, while I'm dreaming of an ideal Shanghai, I'd also be attending services at the  urlLink Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Most Holy Mother of God , built 1931 in the French Concession, just up the road from where my mum used to live as a child:    or the  urlLink Church of the Tsar-Martyr St Nicholas  (the Russian Military parish).    Alas, today, the Cathedral, where  urlLink St John the Wonderworker  ( urlLink here's a church  dedicated to him) once served, is now a securities exchange firm and also houses a disco on the second floor under the dome-the "St Peter's Club", while Old Nicholas the Magnificent is now a resturant and casino.

      The FBI issued a terrorist warning after receiving a tip on an evil millionaire -- who turned out to be a character in a video game. It was the lead item on the government's daily threat matrix one day last April. Don Emilio Fulci described by an FBI tipster as a reclusive but evil millionaire, had formed a terrorist group that was planning chemical attacks against London and Washington, D.C. That day even FBI director Robert Mueller was briefed on the Fulci matter. But as the day went on without incident, a White House staffer had a brainstorm: He Googled Fulci. His findings: Fulci is the crime boss in the popular video game Headhunter. "Stand down," came the order from embarrassed national security types.  One wonders if the April day in question was 1st April.

      The Vatican's official astronomer, Brother Guy Consolmagno, has given an interview in which he discusses the Vatican's thinking on what to do if alien intelligence is discovered:  We find an intelligent civilization and there's no way in creation we can communicate with them because they're so alien to us. We can't talk to dolphins now. In which case, we'll never know.  Second scenario: We find the intelligent civilization. We can communicate. We discover that they have the two essentials that theologians talk about for the human soul, intelligence and free will. They know who they are, they're self-aware, and they're able to do something about it. I think dogs are self-aware, but they don't have a whole lot of free will. Maybe computers are the same sort of thing. Human beings have to have both...  A third scenario: We find a dozen civilizations out there, and a bunch of Jehovah's witnesses go up and convert them all. At the end of the day, every civilization is Christian, except the human race is still not too sure about this. I mean, anything's possible.

       Not a comforting read.   (I'd say VERY WORRYING - Ed.)   Again, from  urlLink Gerard Serafin :   And another longer piece about a new book by Italian firebrand, Oriana Fallaci,    urlLink La Forza della Ragione (The Force of Reason)  .  "..The last chapters of The Force of Reason are dedicated to explaining why Europe's three main political and social forces (Left, Right, and the Church) gave in to what she calls "the Islamic invasion." While Fallaci accuses the Left and Right mostly of ignorance and opportunism, her harshest words are left for the Church.  Fallaci has been known throughout her long career for her strong anti-clericalism (she is a long-time leftist, daughter of an Italian partisan who fought the Fascists), but describes herself as a "Christian atheist." While stating that she does not believe in God, she claims that the West cannot ignore its Christian origin and identity. Even if we deny God's existence, Fallaci says, Christianity has shaped the Western world. It defines "who we are, where we are coming from, and where we are going."  But the Church, she says, is not able — or worse, not willing — to defend Christianity. Fallaci accuses the Church of helping the expansion of the "Islamic empire," lobbying for more Muslims to come to Europe. She points out that Christianity offers its churches as shelters to Muslim immigrants, who immediately turn them into mosques, as it has happened repeatedly in France and Italy. It continuously apologizes for the Crusades, but never expects an apology for what Muslims are doing now to Christians in Sudan or Indonesia."

       A chance encounter with an Iraqi priest.    When the conversation turned to life in Iraq, Father Hermiz explained that the majority of Christians there support America's effort. Yet he described what he referred to as a contradiction: The Christians are pleased that Saddam is gone, yet they felt safer under Saddam. This is because Saddam did not bother Christians so long as they kept to themselves. While this meant that Christians could not openly proselytize, it nonetheless allowed them to maintain churches and hold services without fear of government reprisal. Since Saddam's fall, however, Father Hermiz lamented that one church in Baghdad has been bombed, and the Christians are scared. His parishioners are concerned about the Shias, who they fear will not adhere to Saddam's "don't bother us, and we won't bother you" policy. While Father Hermiz expressed fear about extremists like Muqtada al-Sadr weeks before the Mehdi Army clashed with American forces, he also expressed fear about the seemingly moderate Ayatollah Sistani and his followers. The priest asserted, "If [an] imam like Sistani says, 'Go and kill yourself,' they will do it without question." [ urlLink link  from  urlLink Gerard Serafin ]

      How does one deal with people who are over-familiar with one? It's one thing about Singaporeans that drives my family and me up the wall.   People ringing me on behalf of companies call me "Edward". Counter staff and service personnel call me "Edward". 30year-old real estate agents call my father (who is 72 this year by the way) "David".   How does one tell these people, "MISTER Yong to you", without sounding churlish and snobbish? I don't like this over-familiarity. In non-business and non-professional contexts, I'd never dream of being called "Mr Yong". However, I take exception to servants and ESPECIALLY employees of the Government calling me by my first name.   Where did this horrible phenomenon come from? America, no doubt, where they maintain an illusion of equality and pretend everyone is equal in a social context. It seems to be used by folk who haven't had a proper education (they probably studied Business or the Sciences or something like that), and who think it's awfully progressive and clever to be on a first-name basis with their customers and superiors. They don't seem to realise it's "cringe-making", as my Scottish friend Angela puts it. I think it's plain rude.   Is it too much to ask for that respectful distance? I'd never dream of calling a senior, superior or anyone I'm performing a service for by their first name unless given permission to do so and even then I'd be uncomfortable doing so. It's the way I was brought up.   -  It seems several superstitions regarding what is unlucky in English-speaking lands date only to the Protestant Deformation.   The number 13 was considered lucky in Mediaeval England, as it stood for Christ and the Apostles. To this day, a "Baker's Dozen" means 13.   Walking under a ladder was also considered lucky - a triangle symbolises the Holy Trinity.   These changed when the Puritans took over and persecuted those who clung to the Old Faith - they made these old cultural things into unlucky things.

      I've just introduced a counter on my blog, it's that little number one sees on the left column below the "If you have problems viewing the Chinese, Greek or Cyrillic characers". It's a useful thing from  urlLink www.sitemeter.com  which, aside from letting one know the number of visitors, allows one to see the pages from which one's visitors surf into one's blog, as well as their domains.   I'm only slightly surprised to see that 33.3% of my readers are from Singapore, and that a good percentage are from other English-speaking countries (if Singapore may be deemed an English-speaking country). What *does* surprise me is the 3.33% that comes from "United States Government" - the  .gov  addresses.  I know some of the readers of this blog, but apparently there are plenty I don't.

      The Mahometans who beheaded an American on video last week, as they did the unspeakable deed, cried "Allahu Akbar!" or "God is Great!". My first thought was, you'd never find Christians doing anything of that sort. After all, it seems impossible to imagine Jesuits beheading pagans while crying "In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti!" and glorifying the Trinity.   Then again, I thought for a bit and realised that there HAVE been instances of Christians committing murder while gleefully singing praises to the Trinity.   I thought of the Crusaders storming into Albi Cathedral, while Mass was in progress, cutting down the congregation of mixed Catholics and Albigensian heretics as they processed toward the altar, singing "Veni Sancte Spiritus" "Come Holy Spirit", slaying even the priests at the altar.   I thought of the Catholic Croats torturing and murdering Orthodox Serbs in the early 20th Century.   I thought of the Auto-da-Fes and witchburnings. Granted, these have been ridiculously exaggerated by historians hostile to the church through the ages, but still, even one error is too many.   Let's not even mention Catholics vs Protestants in Ireland. The bloodshed during the Protestant Deformation.   Then it occured to me. Violence done in the name of the Trinity tends to be against other Christians, not against non-Christians. Not a very encouraging thought, but there you go.   Still, I'm encouraged by the fact that Christ advocated non-violence and pacifism. Mahomet on the other hand, is so violent in the Koran, ordering mass murder and inciting his followers to hate... that were he alive today, he would be arraigned as a war criminal.

It's been really educational. I'm curious though - what made you choose me over the other guys who tried out for the role?"   Keng Sen : "Well, Edward, to be honest, most of the guys who came to audition for the part of Malcolm looked like they came to audition for Ah-Beng."  Ha!

      from  urlLink Otto-da-Fe :    The historically Polish town of Hamtramck, Michigan  urlLink is divided  over a city ordinance in allowing mosques to broadcast calls to prayer over loudspeakers. The Muslims claim it is comparable to church bells (though the bells, to my knowledge, do not form intelligible phrases, such as "Allah is the greatest"). Supporters of the ordinance say it is a matter of tolerance, and the  urlLink Christian Science Minitor  writes the following:        In many ways, the controversy is simply a symptom of a community's growing discomfort with its own evolution - and more particularly, a sign of just how deep the distrust of Muslim cultures has grown in the wake of Sept. 11 and the war with Iraq.      Hamtramck has long prided itself on being a "touch of Europe in America," an enclave of pirogis and polkas in the midst of Detroit. A statue of Pope John Paul II, next to a mural of Poles dancing in Krakow, stands in the center of town, and some storeowners greet customers in Polish.      Over the past decade, however, Hamtramck has changed. It's still the first stop for many immigrants, but now they come from Bangladesh, Yemen, Bosnia, Somalia, and Pakistan, as well as from Eastern Europe. Muslims make up a third or more of the population, and shops selling halal meat and Bengali spices are as common as the Polish bakeries.      These latest arrivals have been hard for some longtime residents to accept. And the prayer controversy has stirred up an old uneasiness with, even hostility toward, a culture and religion that remain mysterious to many here.    I have a sensible proposal: all the Catholic churches in the town should broadcast the  urlLink Angelus  daily at 6 AM, noon, and 6 PM (and the Regina Coeli during Paschal time). Then we will see who is uneasy, intolerant, and hostile.

      From  urlLink Otto-da-Fe :   urlLink Another paragraph  in Islam's long and exasperating declaration of independence from Civilization.       The video showed five men wearing headscarves and black ski masks, standing over a bound man in an orange jumpsuit — similar to a prisoner's uniform — who identified himself as Nick Berg, a U.S. contractor whose body was found on a highway overpass in Baghdad on Saturday.      "My name is Nick Berg, my father's name is Michael, my mother's name is Susan," the man said on the video. "I have a brother and sister, David and Sarah. I live in ... Philadelphia."      After reading a statement, the men were seen pulling the man to his side and putting a large knife to his neck. A scream sounded as the men cut his head off, shouting "Allahu Akbar!" — "God is great." They then held the head out before the camera.   A religion of peace indeed.

      Readers, I've been wondering if I should be splitting up my blog into two separate blogs.   I originally meant for this blog to be a sort of notebook of random things: thoughts, reflections, weblinks, interesting articles, rants and suchlike.   Should I now divide future content into a blog for my personal life and thoughts, and another one for weblinks, films, music and articles?  A poll!

         Those of us in Asia will have seen these: the Japanese cat called Maneki-neko, which means 'beckoning cat'. They are thought to bring good luck or attract customers to the shop. There is a famous story about an extremely poor temple whose cat beckoned to a traveller who was sitting under a tree outside its gates. He decided to come in and just as he moved away from the tree, it was struck by lightning. The stranger turned out to be extremely rich and he became the temple's patron, making it extremely wealthy. There are several different varieties of Maneki-neko and they all have different meanings. Traditionally, the kitty with her left paw raised brings in business and the kitty with her right paw raised brings in money and good fortune. Or you can hedge your bets and adopt both! Most Maneki-neko are white:     but if you see a black one, it is warding off evil:     The black Maneki-neko has gained popularity among the ladies to ward off stalkers. The even rarer red ones are to prevent sickness:     The trendy Maneki-nekos may be gold or pink. The gold one invites money and the pink one attracts love.   Someone's set up a  urlLink Maneki-neko club  with lots of detail and explanations of the cute kitty.

       Dad thinks I'm nuts. I have half a mind to grow my hair long and then put it up in a topknot fastened with a cloth band and a stick, like the Chinese and Koreans once did in centuries past. The Chinese haven't had topknots since the Manchus conquered China in the 1600s and decreed that all Han Chinese must shave the fronts of their heads and have their hair in queues (or pigtails as some call it).   I can't seem to find a picture of a Chinese topknot, so here are some of the Korean topknot, the  Sangtu , which really looks quite similar, except the Chinese don't wear that horsehair band around the forehead.        any comments, folks? Dad thinks I've been watching too many period films.

       Soundtrack:  Gavotte avex Six Doubles  from the  Suite in La Majeur  by Jean-Philippe Rameau, published in  Nouvelles Suites de Pièces de Clavecin (1728) , played by William Christie. Late French Baroque harpsichord music, one of my favourites.   My current favoured Web browser is Mozilla Firefox version 0.8 - it's faster than IE and keeps multiple open webpages within the same window by using tabs. Opera's faster than IE and uses the same tabs idea but somehow seems buggy on my computer. I've been an Netscape boy until about 2001, when I switched over to IE out of laziness. Now I'm checking Netscape's website and it seems there's now version 7.1 out... the last time I updated my Netscape was in 2000 with version 4.73. Let's download that and see how it fares against Mozilla and IE.  Meanwhile, I've closed down my  urlLink old homepage . I don't think anyone will shed a tear for its departure, since there've been no updates on it since 1998. Still, I was one of the first Singaporeans to have a homepage when commercial internet access became available in 1995. Those were the days when one still worked with html code, before the wysiwyg html helpers came along. It was nifty in the early days - moving gifs and all. But hey, the net's come a long way since 1995, as have we all. Hence, with a brief moment and a smile to remember the friends I've made around the world who've surfed into the website... I took it down. Quite painless, I'm surprised. I really oughtn't have left that website get so ridiculously outdated - one notice on the main page said the last update was sometime in 1998 and that the next one was scheduled for 1999. It's 2004 already. Heh. Talk about being lazy.  A temporary notice is now in its place. I'm not making any promises about when the new homepage will be done. I don't even know what to do with it. Perhaps I'll make it a sort of respository of supplemental pages to my blog. We shall see.   However, as there have been several important external links to my pages on  urlLink The Feast of Fools  and my  urlLink Virtual Shrine of St Thomas of Canterbury , as a service to the scholars who use them, I've kept them on the server for now. In time, they will be updated too.   So I've pretty much cleared my homepage folder in the Pacific Internet server. But I've kept what I need for this webpage. Interestingly enough, in the process of clearing the webpage, I've discovered a number of external direct links to my images, links which didn't have my permission. I didn't even know they existed. To use someone else's images for one's webpage or whatever without permission (or at least notification) is, to say the least, extremely rude. I don't do it, and I don't expect you would either - I like to think only people with a certain amount of class read my blog!  So what've I done in response to these people? Firsly, I've renamed the target image files and adjusted all my own links to the files accordingly. Here comes the funny bit. I've put in various image files and renamed them to correspond to my old image filenames, and hence those links in other websites will now point to the new image files that bear the old names. This gives various results to diverse websites and petty thieves. To those websites towards whom I've felt particular annoyance at the image (and bandwidth, mind you) theft now have rather rude pictures adorning their site. I wasn't quite so evil as to follow the suggestion of one friend to use pornographic pictures. Other lesser offenders now have graphics such as these on their pages:         Great fun. *chuckle*

       Soundtrack:   Für Alina  by Arvo Pärt. Meditative, minimalist and very serene.    Did a bit of voice work on Monday, narrating an expository video about some IT company. I'm trying to get more work of this sort, as it pays quite well - $200 for a page of text and a hour's work. The chaps who did that recording seem to like my voice, and they're asking me to do more stuff, including a multi-part documentary on Indonesia. Let's hope it works out. The lady in charge of the place said the problem with most men's voice in Singapore is that they tend to be rather high-pitched and slightly nasal. Apparently my voice is a pleasant bass, clear and articulated. They also appreciated my ability to speak Received Pronunciation and do accents. Whee!   Support bacteria. They're the only culture some people have.   Now that I've got a mobile phone cable and appropriate software on my computer, I find I can put in various midi files as ringtones and various image files as wallpapers. Hurrah, great fun, even though I know it's a cheap thrill. I've been fooling around with this since Mid-Lent or so, and the novelty of the games on my phone has worn down finally!   It seems tertiary students and all teachers are entitled to a $350 discount on iPods. With the 40G iPod priced at $928 before discount, it looks like I might finally be able to get one!   Oh, I've been lusting after an iPod ever since I got the chance to test-drive one nearly 2 years ago while reviewing it for Twenty4Seven magazine. Hurrah!

      I just watched Higuchinsky's  urlLink Uzumaki , another Japanese horror film. This time it's about a small town plagued by... spirals. I'm not kidding. It's really weird, and I can't say I enjoyed it. I can say I'm puzzled by it. It really would take the Japanese to come up with something like this. It's supposed to be based on a comic. Ah. That explains a lot. It is now nearly 2 in the morning. All I can say about the film is "what the hell?" but hey, it was nothing if not original. Very Lovecraft. Still, I think I preferred Kwaidan!

       Soundtrack:  Various tracks from Michael Nyman's score for the film Gattaca.  First some from  urlLink Serge :     urlLink Bum Rap Pinned On Parents :   Acts of brutality are carried out in the name of ‘reasonable chastisement’ but, says Rachel Johnson, banning smacking will only encourage children to believe that they have a right to behave as they please.  I think she's absolutely right. There is a place for a good hard slap after warning.      urlLink US military now trying to buy abused prisoners :    By the Gods, have they no sense of shame?       urlLink ‘Gay’ protesters denied Communion  : In a nutshell, what happened was that a certain sort of gay Catholics in the US wore rainbow sashes to Mass on Pentecost to protest the Church's official teachings on homosexuality and were denied Communion. This is quite right of course, because anyone who doesn't believe what the Church teaches has no right to receive Communion. However, we've got people quoted in the article: '  "Who is the church to say who can and cannot get communion?" said Greg Van Hyfte, 27, carrying a rainbow-hued umbrella prior to the services to fend off a driving rain. ' Excuse me, the Church is PRECISELY the authority that defines who gets Communion and who doesn't. To quote Serge's homosexual Catholic friend,  "no normal, dignified adult would wear a rainbow-coloured sash to tell strangers how he likes to reach orgasm."    Then from the  urlLink Old Oligarch , who tells us his     urlLink Reasons for drinking  include  "Drinking is the sole remaining Dionysian act in which I can indulge when my Apollonian side needs counterbalancing."  Mmm, nice!    He's also got a great post on  urlLink Absinthe ..   And a  urlLink delightful little rant  on how women shouldn't EVER work in fine men's clothing stores. I agree entirely of course.    Fr Jim at  urlLink Dappled Things  has watched Troy and made the following  urlLink excellent observation : One last impression comes from the absence of gods. Cutting out the numerous appearances of the gods was doubtless a decision to aim for realism. But there was more to it than that. Every time the Trojans make a decision based on religion, it fails. The gods are worse than deaf and absent: people's belief in them brings them more harm than good -- not the gods themselves, but the mere belief. That touch is almost Euripideanly subversive. A BRILLIANT point.

       Soundtrack:   Veni Redemptor Gentium , by Paul Schwartz. New-ageish, ambient-ish, a melody taken from Gregorian Chant... but worlds away from Enigma's Sadness of the late 80s.   I sit at my computer, slowly enjoying an after-dinner dessert of greek yoghurt with a spoonful of honey mixed in. I've decided to give it a bit of a devil's tail by adding in some sultanas soaked in gin.   My hair, that has been bleached to a platinum blond for the last 24 hours, has been driving my father up the wall. He hates me blond. So I'm also sitting here with a whole load of dye in my hair. Oh no, I'm not colouring it back to my natural brown-black. I'm not going back to the royal blue either for now, as I have to help dad with business and royal blue hair won't look good at discussions and meetings. I'll go back to that when I'm an academic or a student again.   For the meantime, I'm dyeing it to the nice dark midnight blue-black I had last October. It's Garnier's No. 210 Blue-Black. Quite an amazing colour, this, as it looks blacker than brown-black under artificial lighting, and under strong sunlight it's royal blue. Brilliant!  Upon reflection, I now realise I've been colouring my hair on and off for over a decade now, since I was 15 and realised I had grey in my hair. My hair's natural colour is currently the usual East-Asian brown-black, but with perhaps 10% grey scattered throughout. The interesting thing about having so much scattered grey is that grey picks up a lighter shade of whichever colour I'm doing, so it's almost like highlights of a sort. In the past few years, my hair's gone through copper, mahogany, aubergine, red, royal blue... I'm tempted to do a real nice blond sometime. What I'm never going to do is green (for green and black are the colours of Raffles Institution, my school's archrival).  I'm wondering though. After years of hair-colouring, I'm now convinced that European and American women have smaller hands than Asian women. Why this conviction? All hair-colouring kits come with disposable plastic gloves to wear while colouring hair. Oddly, Japanese hair-dye packs come with rather large and comfortable gloves, yet the European and American kits all come with much smaller gloves. Curious.

       Soundtrack:   Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda  by Claudio Monteverdi, performed by Concerto Italiano under Rinaldo Alessandrini. A short work, it's an example of semi-opera. Imagine a story sung by a narrator, but with 2 other singers singing the words spoken by the characters. Lovely stuff.     Just discovered a amusing chinese circumlocution (speaking in circles to avoid directly touching a sensitive subject or taboo)! 廟小﹐燈籠大 - literally translated, ' temple small, lanterns big ". Chinese temples always have two lanterns hanging at the entrance, and these are usually large and red. A small temple with overly large lanterns is an unusual occurence. The circumlocution refers to a small woman with large, uh, mammaries.   I realise one of the recurring dreams I have relates to flying. In these dreams, all I have to do is stretch my arms out, jump up a little and I'm flying. Can't figure out how I do it, but I'm able to control speed and direction as I like. I'm usually flying over familiar territory, with friends smiling and cheering below. I always feel good after one of these dreams, which leave me with an empowered sort of feeling.    Ghafar Baba, sometime Prime Minister of Malaysia, has been a family friend for ages now. Dad told me back in the 60s when the Communists in Vietnam (opposed by China but supported by Russia) threatened to take Thailand and Malaysia, Ghafar Baba confided to him,  'I'd rather be a subject of the great British Empire than of these buffalo-herding peasants' . I know the feeling...    Was in Malacca over the weekend, as Dad had to pick up some documents from there, and the three of us decided to make it an overnight outing. The name of the city is amusing if one knows Modern Greek, as 'Μαλακα' (Malaka) is current rude Greek slang equivalent for the British 'wanker'.    Have decided to check out Asian Horror films. Watched the Ju-On series on Monday night, specifically  Ju-On: The Grudge  and  Ju-On: The Prequel . Well, I'd heard no end of the films from friends and reviews, all of which pronounced them far scarier than anything else from the West. I watched them as a night marathon after midnight (so technically Tuesday morning), alone. I was expecting to be scared silly. I ended up quite bored. I can't figure out why they're supposed to be so terrifying. Someone tell me, please!   My friend  urlLink Melissa  said in her blog,  'There's nothing like the oasis of an empty Tiffany's store with La Vie En Rose playing softly in the background to make a girl feel like Audrey Hepburn for that moment in time.' , and that made me think of the last time I bought something from Tiffany's for someone special. There's a lovely old-fashioned feeling of romance attached to going into Tiffany's. Picking out an item. Watching it go into the blue box. The silver ribbon around the box. It was for Zhi, with whom I'm now only in occasional contact, but for whom I was absolutely over the moon at the time. Granted, Zhi's an absolute charmer, and he's almost impossible to faze, ever-cool. I still remember his eyes went quite wide, and how he made a little sharp intake of breath when I produced the Tiffany's bag and took the blue box out of it. Ben, the chap who served me at Tiffany's, another former student, is now in the army, and it is he, ironically, with whom I'm now much closer and more likely to court. There's far more chemistry between Ben and me, and of a very... shall we say, interesting sort. Life's funny like that.

       Soundtrack:   urlLink  Toccata   by Claudio Merulo. One of the most important composers of the Venetian school, Merulo was organist at St Mark's in Venice. His style is simple but requires virtuoso runs in both hands.   Alright, so about three weeks ago, while I'm visiting Grandma in Borneo, East Malaysia, I get an email from my old pal Daniel Tan, who's getting married the first weekend of August. He'd invited me to the wedding ages ago, but this email was a bit of s surprise.   "Would you honour us by being the cantor at our wedding?" - which is alright so far.   "Can you find yourself a choir to sing with and an organist?" (I'm paraphrasing) - I nearly fell off my chair.   They didn't want the usual cheesy tacky music, so I offered a chant, baroque and renaissance combination, very simple stuff but very 'churchy'.  Lucky for them and for me, I managed to rope together Alan Lau and Chris Ow - we're just singing the Kyrie and the Alleluia before the Gospel. Finding an organist wasn't difficult - Ten Yeen very kindly obliged.  Ten Yeen's performed at the Victoria Concert Hall organ, and she's an excellent organist (i.e. pedals and multiple manuals, not the electronic burp-boxes) - she's been playing for Anglican churches (and not RC ones, hence she has taste) since she was a teen. The music she's playing will be Merulo and Frescobaldi:   Prelude -  Toccata  by Merulo ( urlLink midi available here ).  Toccata avanti il Recercar della Messa degli Apostoli  by Frescobaldi, from  Fiori Musicali .   The hymns -  Crown Him with Many Crowns ,  God of all living  (to the tune of  'Morning has broken' ) and  To God be the Glory .  Postlude -  Canzon post il Comune della Messa de Domenica  by Frescobaldi, from  Fiori Musicali . Possibly repeat the  Toccata  from earlier as well.   Fortunately, the singers and I (who've only had one rehearsal together) don't have very much to sing. Aside from leading the hymns, we're singing the  Kyrie  from the  Mass for 3 voice s by William Byrd (it's for 3 voices and quite easy, couldn't put anything more complicated together) and the Gregorian Alleluia (with verse). The Alleluia verse is taken from the Mass of the Holy Trinity on Trinity Sunday, traditionally also used at mediaeval English Royal Weddings - gorgeously meandering in the way that the best Gregorian chants can be.  So now the Wedding is tomorrow - 7th Aug at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Tank Road.   Daniel also requested I sing something to cover the signing of the marriage register at the end of the service. Alright, so I thought, do I want to sing a piece for Bass or Alto? I figured Alto would be more memorable, so I chose originally the opening aria from Bach's Cantata BWV 170  Vergnügte Ruh, Beliebte Seelenlust . I love this aria - bittersweetly lyrical in the way Bach typically is. The text is:   Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, Dich kann man nicht bei Höllensünden, Wohl aber Himmelseintracht finden; Du stärkst allein die schwache Brust. Drum sollen lauter Tugendgaben In meinem Herzen Wohnung haben.   Contented rest, belove'd inner joy, We cannot find thee midst hell's mischief, But rather in the heav'nly concord; Thou only mak'st the weak breast strong. Thus I'll let only virtue's talents Within my heart maintain their dwelling.   But alas,  urlLink Andreas Scholl  I ain't. The highest note in that aria is the second E above Middle C, and it gets used a LOT. I simply can't do it at modern pitch (A=440). The only way I'm going to be able to do that aria is at least a whole tone (or more) down. Even more, it's nearly 7 minutes long - too long.   So I looked and found something nice for alto at slightly more than 3 minutes - the second aria from BWV 35 Geist und Seele. The piece is a bit high, but do-able at baroque pitch (half a tone lower than modern). It's scored for Alto, organ oblig. and continuo, so doing it with just organ and alto is close to the orginal. The vocal line's quite florid, but thankfully coloratura isn't a problem for me, only high notes and sustain. If you care to hear it,  urlLink a midi is available here . Also, the text is quite nice:   Gott hat alles wohlgemacht. Seine Liebe, seine Treu Wird uns alle Tage neu. Wenn uns Angst und Kummer drücket, Hat er reichen Trost geschicket, Weil er täglich für uns wacht. Gott hat alles wohlgemacht.   God has made all things well. His love, his faithfulness We see ev'ry day renewed. When both fear and toil oppress us, He has sent us ample comfort, Since He watches over us daily. God has made all things well.   This one Ten Yeen and I started work on at Thursday evening's wedding rehearsal. Heh.  So listen to that midi of the aria and realise that Ten Yeen and I are going to be meeting at 8 on the morning of the wedding (it starts at 11) to hammer this one out. Gillian's already called my voice fabulous, ha. That was even before I could get all the notes right. Yes, I know... I'm a show-off, but hey, if you've got it... Let's just hope my voice holds out. I'm surprised Daniel and Gillian are eager to have a man singing in high voice doing a solo at their wedding, but then he went to King's College London and she was from Cambridge, so oh well.

       Soundtrack:  'Parce mihi Domine' from Morales' Requiem, sung by La Capella Reial de Catalunya, Hespèrion XX, dir. Jordi Savall.   So there I was, preparing to do a voice-over for some video.   Lady-in-charge: 'You can do accents right? What accents can you do?' Me: 'For American, only a generic mid-west. For English, I can do Public-School, London cockney...' Lady: 'What is this public school? I've never heard of it before.' Me: 'it's the accent of the highest level of the upper classes' Lady: ' oh very good, i think we'll go for that'  So alright, I start reading the script in my best cutting-glass accent... Noel Coward would've been so proud. Halfway through the second paragraph, she stops me.  Lady: 'Eh, excuse me ah... what is that accent?' Me: 'It's English. Upper Class.' Lady: 'But it doesn't sound anything like David Beckham!'  (sensible readers will now intone a solemn  Te Deum  in thanksgiving that I don't sound anything like him)  She insisted that Beckham's accent was more recognisable as classy. I refused to sound anything like him (I said I couldn't do it). We compromised in the end on a sort of London city accent. Urgh.

      I have horrible annoying Indian neighbours. They're loud, smelly (and I mean cooking smells) and filthy. They have a little black terrier with long curly fur. Today I found out what they call it - I was on my way home and I saw the mistress of the house standing in the corridor yelling at it: 'BLACKIE!'.  Considering they're actually darker than the dog is, this is highly ironic. Pots and kettles, I say.

He also muses about  urlLink singaporeans and accents :   So today, seven (going on eight) years later I've got a pretty much neutral accent with an unmistakably British tinge to it.

Having said that, one of the blokes I fenced with the other night was from Eaton. heh)   Two things to add - I've got a perfect Public School accent =p and it's 'Eton'! =p

       Soundtrack: 'Baya Baya' by Safri Duo    Hi all. *sheepish grin*. I'm back. Numerous choes of 'I can see' from the readers, no doubt. Apologies - I got depressed for a bit then got lazy to blog... then various things conspired to lead my attention away from blogging. I'm going to try returning now :)   Church Bombings   I suppose we've all heard about the horrible church bombings in Baghdad. Armenian, Syrian, Assyrian and Chaldaean parishes, if I recall correctly. O Lord, watch over Thy suffering people! Meanwhile, which part of 'Yankee go home' don't the American troops understand?  Before the American invasion, Iraqi Christians worshipped in peace in a secular regime - Easter, Christmas and all holidays were celebrated joyously. Now...   Athens Mosque  Meanwhile, plans for Athens’s first official mosque are being finalised.  "The mosque, part of a cultural center which has been in the planning stages for many years, is to be funded by the Saudi Arabian government. The plan to build the mosque at Pallini has been criticized by the Church of Greece, which says that the fact that it is near the airport will give visitors the impression that they have arrived in an Islamic state. Pallini residents, who are mostly Christian, fear that the mosque will change the character of their town. Muslims lament the fact that they will have to travel a long way from the center, where most of them live, in order to worship."  Hopefully someone will dynamite it. That it is being built in Athens, and not where the majority of Greece's Muslim population actually lives shows that this is a sign of power and presence, and not primarily a consideration on the part of its financers (the Saudis) to actually serve the Muslim population in Greece.  This is much like the recent building of Europe's largest mosque in of all places, Rome.  The symbolism of this is undeniable - the spiritual capital of some of Islam's (once/historically) fiercest foes (western Christendom, in particular the Crusaders) being host to one of the biggest mosques in the world (and the biggest in Europe) is gushing with subtext.  What is doubly worse, is that the Imam appointed to lead the Grand Mosque of Rome (Imam Abdel-Samie Mahmoud Ibrahim Moussa) is cut from the same cloth as the radical clerics in the middle east proper (see article  urlLink Roman Imam: Destroy Islam's Enemies  for evidence of this.)  That the Saudi's are funding this Athenian mosque is particularly galling, since in Saudi Arabia itself permission is never granted for the building of Churches, and what little Christian presence there is in Saudia Arabia has to live in such a way as to be totally invisible.  Even bringing so much as a Bible with one into Saudi Arabia is forbidden, and it will either be confiscated or one will be turned away. It's pretty annoying, when one thinks about the fact that the Saudi establishment is funding and encouraging the building of mosques and the proselytization of people worldwide, yet they're unwilling to allow the same in their own "holy" land. Pass the dynamite! But they hey, if it's being built by Greek labourers... it'll never get finished in the first place (rather like several Olympic venues).    DISGUSTING   urlLink     I find it ironic that a group called "Planned" Parenthood would have a t-shirt proud of what is usually the outcome of an unplanned pregnancy.    urlLink Kremlin Sued For Return Of Churches     More than 80 years after its churches were seized by "godless Bolsheviks" and turned into anything from grain stores to shoe factories the Russian Orthodox Church is launching an unprecedented legal battle to win back its property.  Furious that the Russian state still owns most of the country's churches 13 years after the collapse of Communism, and has had the gall to start charging it land tax, the church has launched the first property restitution lawsuit since the Russian Revolution in 1917.  The lawsuit, which is regarded as a test case that could open the flood gates for thousands of other restitution claims from aristocrats to foreign governments, relates to the stunning 15th-century Church of Ilia the Prophet in Moscow which currently houses Russia's State Museum of the East. The church wants it to become a "living place of worship" once again and says it is poised to launch a rash of similar lawsuits throughout the Russian capital which could see a third of the land owned by the state in Moscow contested.  The church was dispossessed of all its property in 1918 under a sweeping decree issued by the Bolshevik leader Lenin, an atheist. Before the revolution it had been Russia's largest landowner with some 7.5 million acres to its name but overnight it lost it all. Icons and other religious paraphernalia were plundered, bell towers were toppled, hundreds of churches were simply bulldozed out of existence and at least 45,000 priests were murdered.   Oh this will be fun!

						   Yesterday I made a fateful decision. I've decided not to take part in Singapore Idol.  [insert canned laughter here]   But seriously folks....  It wasn't a "chickening out". I am not disillusioned with judges, quality of potential fellow contestants, or an inability to deal with my ugly mug on prime time TV. It was a decision born out of a simple decision that my wife has made that will impact greatly on my future, but especially my immediate future.    I am, of course, a little disappointed and probably a bit regretful. I had after all gone through many many adventures to get my application form together. I had sung my heart out in the privacy of my car on my evening commute home. I had experimented with various songs, arrangements and pitching. I was even starting to sound halfway decent. That is assuming that you consider going off-key 1 time out of 10 "decent". I could even make a career out of people paying me  not  to sing.  There is that part of me that also wonders what happened to my formerly strong tenor voice. I've tried it out. It sounds a little better than a croak, and it gets rough and unstable at pitches that I used to have no problems tackling. My guess is about 2 years of caffeine and calorie abuse. It is about time I slowed down.  I consider this all for the best. The joke value of having a slightly pudgy, almost-30 chinese male shaking his stuff on stage isn't quite worth the commitment in resources for Singapore Idol. In addition, I am greatly excited at the prospect of what is going to happen over the next few months. God bless me, this may be the biggest project I've undertaken in my life. I pray that it will work out.  Oh well. I've always preferred respect to fame anyways.

						   I write this entry to keep a promise I made three weeks ago.  My friend Edward has written  urlLink a most comprehensive review and devastatingly accurate review of Troy . Treading on the back of this particular giant, I write to elaborate on my three-line contribution to Edward's review, and to fulfil my promise to him.   The Short Version   Vacuum cleaners have less suck than this movie.   The Long Version   When one wishes to make a screen adaptation of an epic like the Iliad, one has a certain responsibility to make sure the screen adaptation lives up to the expectations of the written work. Granted, one does not have to remain true to every word of the written material, only to the essence of the work.  Nevertheless one does not abrogate this responsibility merely by invoking the words "Based loosely on".  Troy, in its essence, was about gods and heroes. Gods and heroes are larger than life. Larger than life does not mean having to speak with a fake British accent, wearing polyester or lovingly angled shots of vaseline coated bodies. It means that when gods and heroes move, mere mortals tremble and run for cover.   Hence, the battle between Hector and Archilles should  not  bring about images of Baywatch, dubbed to the tune of "We are Family".  One can only stand in awe of the movie - an awe born of the terrible  waste  of it all. Even ignoring the fact that the movie failed to pay proper homage, it was perfectly horrid on its own merits. Given the amount of money spent paying for A-list stars and paying off reviewers to write positive reviews, the producers could at least afford better scriptwriters and choreographers. They could certainly afford to get a clue.  Let's start with the CGI. It's beautiful. Oh yes, it is. But here's a hint - looping CGI to give the effect of epic scale is an outdated technique. I do not want to spot the same Greek hurling himself into the sea of Trojans four times over. I especially do not wish to spot said Greek doing so using the exact same jump trajectory every time. I cannot suspend my disbelief when I see that on screen. Even Greek fighting discipline has limits. The Greek army was not the German World Cup team taking corner kicks.  And the one-on-one battle sequences! I love John Woo. I really do. I do, however, believe that 30-pound spears and heavy bronze swords should not lend themselves to beautiful ballet-like movements. The crispness and originality in the fight scenes suffered accordingly. How many ways can you make a person wielding clunky sword, shield, spear and full bronze armour look graceful? I am suprised, and frankly a little disappointed, that the stuntment did not develop brain anuerisms on the spot. The movie would have been much improved by it.  I have only one good thing to say about the movie. I honestly enjoyed Troy, and not in the way the movie makers intended.

						   It's been a while since I've updated my blog with substantive writing. Truth is, I had written fresh blog entries no fewer than 5 times, only to have them deleted. There are some things that I still feel uncomfortable yelling about - no matter how few people read this blog. Yet, yell I must, and it is with some reluctance that I set out my beliefs on the matter without letting too much away.  What could possibly be so private that I cannot set them down into writing? One word. Religion.   I personally think I'm going to Hell for the reason that I disagree with so much of the dogma that is espoused by organised Christianity. It of course begs the question why I -believe- in Hell in the first place. The answer is simple - I believe in God, I know I'm a disobedient christian, yet there are many aspects to my life that I have questioned and found myself or other Christians lacking in the ability to answer.  One of these questions of dogma has recently plagued a good friend of mine. It had plagued my life in the past and left me less of a Christian. I fully understand what he must be going through, and respect the fact that it's a problem that he must sort out for himself. I pray that he will not come to the same conclusion I have - for I know it is his faith that makes him a good person, and I would not see that ruined no matter how little personal respect I have for that particular bit of dogma.   Friend, if you are reading this, always remember that I respect your beliefs even if I don't believe in them myself. You've earned it.  As a side note, I have no doubts that persons reading this blog would seek to clarify my doubts. My response is this - I will not be more specific than saying my relationship with Christians had contributed to the ruining of my relationship with God. I have no desire to see my point being proven yet again.

						     You are a Tuatha de Danann! In Irish-Celtic mythology, the Tuatha De Danann ("People of the goddess Danu") are the Irish race of gods, founded by the goddess Danu. These gods, who originally lived on 'the islands in the west', had perfected the use of magic. The traveled on a big cloud to the land that later would be called Ireland and settled there. Shortly after their arrival they defeated the Firbolg at the first battle of Mag Tuireadh. In the second battle of Mag Tuireadh they fought and conquered the Fomorians, a race of giants who were the primordial inhabitants of Ireland. The Tuatha De dealt more subtly with the Fomorians than with the Firbolg, and gave them the province of Connacht. There was also some marrying between the two races.  The Tuatha De themselves were later driven to the underworld by the Milesians, the people of the fabulous spanish king Milesius. There they still live as invisible beings and are known as the Aes sidhe. In a just battle, they will fight beside mortals. When they fight, they go armed with lances of blue flame and shields of pure white.  Important members are of the Tuatha De are: Dagda, Brigid, Nuada, Lugh, Dian Cecht, Ogma, and Lir. The goddess Danu can also be identified with the Welsh goddess Don.     urlLink   Which Type Of Faery Folk Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   I have interesting friends. They tell me about Japanese fetishes, survival training and ring sizes.   I've just finished dinner with 5 such friends and had a nice instant messenger conversation with another, who asked me the fateful question - why do I even have a blog in the first place?  The question was not an easy one to answer. Originally I had thought the sole reason was merely for reviewing and examining my often-incoherent thoughts. He then asked me the question which I had not thought of.  "Why not a normal journal - pen and paper, or even on your notebook?"  I struggled for an answer for a long time. I keep my blog unsearchable, because I don't feel the need to advertise to the world at large what goes into this blog. For me, it's enough that a few people who -might- be interested know about this blog. However, my friend is correct about one thing. Even a blog that is unsearchable remains a platform for the public, potentially accessible by anyone.  Eventually, I came to the realisation that this blog was more than just a journal to review my thoughts. The "public" aspect of a blog is more important to me than I had originally realised. It stemmed from the fact that I am an immensely private individual.  Sounds self-contradictory?  My friend related to me an experience where he had to undergo survival training, and was not allowed to converse with anyone for a week. The key to surviving with your sanity intact, he said, was to keep talking. It didn't matter to who, to trees, to monkeys, to volleyballs named Wilson. That got me thinking about the human condition and the nature of isolation.  Given that I'm an immensely private individual, I do enjoy my isolation, especially isolation of some of my more radical theories. However, even with self-imposed isolation, the need to communicate remains. The only conclusion I can draw from this is that the human condition abhores isolation, even if it is self-imposed. Specifically, humans, being social creatures, are wired with the need to communicate. Consider, for example, why it is so appealing to yell into canyons or to break uncomfortable silences.  However, where particular humans feel both the need for isolation and the hard-wired need to communicate, there is really only one logical solution - to yell somewhere where you don't have to worry if anyone is listening. It's the same reason a person would find so much pleasure standing on a beach and yelling to your hearts content. The release itself is the pleasure - and one can be fairly certain the fish don't care.  That's my blog. My blog is my mental scream to the tidal wave of the Internet. It doesn't matter if I have a million readers or one. The release is the answer. The release is the purpose. Someone listening is just a bonus.   Postscript: I've changed the title and description of my blog. The new name and description feel more correct than my previous one.

						   Imagine yourself as a flat piece of paper. Now imagine yourself being folded up into a three dimensional figure. Do you have volume or are you just faking it?  Welcome to my little piece of hell. There are many like it, but this one's mine.  I had originally intended this blog as a depository of stray thoughts, my own private, messy, whorly, animistic mess where I can scream my little self-absorbed heart's content. What I did not expect, of course, was the reaction I got from people reading my blog.   A friend of mine called it an "emotional white dwarf", and failed to explain what he meant by that term (he did give a well-reasoned opinion of what he thought of my blog. He just didn't really tell me what he meant by the term).   Another common reaction to people that haven't read it was to tell others not to read it. Look. Virgins have no right to complain about bad sex.  I would personally give myself a 3 out of 5. Given my problems with vocalising my thoughts in a compartmentalised manner, I would consider the entries of the blog a fair effort.  I was, however, pleasantly surprised to find that my good friend Edward not only reads the entries, but took the time to give me a nice link. Edward, for those who don't know, is an absolute snob and a linguistic purist, and his  urlLink blog  is probably one of the most interesting I've read. Granted, I would love to see more than just cross references of interesting articles, but it's fun to read for the interesting commentary.  Since we're out giving referrals, here's a  urlLink link  to the only other blog I read on a semi-regular basis. It's owned by a pair of sisters, Victoria and Gloria. It's strange, surreal and a little more than angsty, but the sheer raw honesty of the blog draws me back time and again. It's like watching Gilmore Girls starring two senior Gilmores, except the cast of Gilmore Girls looks ever-so-slightly better looking.  I have a number of inspirations for this blog.  urlLink Something Positive  is a cartoon that would make this blog look absolutely Bambi-ish in comparison. The artist, R.K Millholland, possesses a scathing wit that I can only dream to equal. His new comic,  urlLink New Gold Dream , is more of an acquired taste (being based on the ever-popular shrine of geek-dom, D&D), but is incredibly funny as well. Go check out Umya especially.  I've also discovered an excellent webcomic today -  urlLink Queen of Wands . The artwork's some of the best I've ever seen in a web-comic, but it's really the emotive script that draws me to it. Go check it out - and read especially the story arc where the characters are introducing their back story. If it doesn't strike you as being particularly profound, please check with your local Darwinist for immediate removal from the gene pool.   Your quote for the day. Something I found on a website dedicated to Babylon 5. This excerpt is simultaneously a profound statement on the search for God and a devastatingly accurate salvo on the state of organised religion. To give some context, the character here, G'kar was -very- surprised to find that his journals had become religious books in his homeworld. Here, a crowd of would-be disciples wish for G'kar to impart his religious wisdom.   Student: What is Truth—what is God?  G’Kar: If I take a lamp and shine it toward the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth, for understanding. Too often, we assume that the light on the wall is God, but the light is not the goal of the search, it is the result of the search. The more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall, the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not search, who does not bring a lantern with him, sees nothing.  What we perceive as God is the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation for the light, pure and unblemished. Not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume that we are the center of the universe. God looks astonishingly like we do. Or we turn to look at our shadow and assume that all is darkness. If we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose, which is to use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all its beauty and in all its flaws. And in so doing to better understand the world around us.  Student: Ah, yes, but what is Truth and what is God?  G’Kar: [sigh] Truth is a...river."  Student: And what is God?  G’Kar: God is...the mouth of the river.  Students (in general): AHHH...(very pleased with the final answer)   Funny stuff.

      This past week has been a rather nostalgic one. Last Fridays dinner with the girls kicked things off. After meeting with them, the old days of the swimming arena haunted me, how truly i miss them all. And it all dwelled on my mind for days. Today, Ravi brought us to his ITE for lunch, and i tell you, Nostalgia, to the max! the canteen was like so dam old-school, the indescripable aroma of the canteen, the commotions, the low-leveled stalls, which all resembled the primary school days of mine. Like, reliving my childhood. We couldnt find words to describe it all. We just sat there for an hour, drawing in the ambience. Beautiful.

I thought about the carefree life i led back then. And i really miss it. I miss my old life. I miss being my true self. I miss all the people. I miss seeing them everyday at training. I miss all the fun we had at swim camps, comps and overseas trips. I miss Pohie, Jame, David, Jon, Kenley, Amanda, Kesh, Kerby, Kel, Coach and everyone else in the old-school bunch.

I'm beginning to fall in love with tea. No specific tea in preference, just normal tea, with milk. Think it all began at those escapades at Little India joints. The teh-tariks there are just so magical, i havent touched coffee ever since. The soothing taste of the combination of tea and sweetened milk and air.. ooh..  Had dinner with U-nice (my mei), Kesh, and Amanda at Adam Road. And also the nice nice gelato at Guthrie. Being with them tonight was just refreshing, a welcomed change that i badly needed. Switching to another wavelength so different from what i face daily, this meeting up was timely. I miss the swimming arena. I miss all the people. I miss those unforgettable times i had with them at comps and camps. Anyway U-nice was like blabbering and blabbering non stop today la. Maybe she ate something wrong today.

Should have some more. i'll chase her for it. My body is aching like shit and i hate this feeling. This is what you get after laying off working out for long periods of time. Now everything starts all over again. Lesson, NEVER lay off your workouts for more than 2 weeks. Caught "Best Bet" today, after so long. I never could find people to watch movies with, unlike everyone else, hence the super late viewing of a movie. Pretty cool, the movie wasnt all about gambling, but also on loyalty. Many think they truly know loyalty. Loyalty aint what you think it is. When you simply call one another " brother ", that aint loyalty. Thats bull.  When the knife is pointed at your neck,   literally  , are you still able to even mutter the word " brother "? When saying the word " brother " meant you might get killed,   literally  , would you still say it?   Looking back, after all the shit KJ stirred, i chose to stick by him, at the cost of getting slapped and  nearly  getting my legs broken. But was it worth it? He cheated me of my money, and embezzled our "funds". So don easily go rattling off about how disloyal a friend  I AM , or not being truthful, or whatever shit. I'll be sad to say, you dont know me. You aint seen nothing yet.

I should start doing runs everyday. Met Mellie today, like finally! Havent seen her in sch this sem, and havent hanged out with her for like ages. i miss you girl. fuck NYP's timetable. Had free dinner tonight again, courtesy of Ter, or rather courtesy of Korea's 4-0 win. Like last tues, we were wreaking havoc again at the KFC. Lester's shit was just crazy. What a bastard. Been having so many eating escapades this sem. Like almost everyday, khai su and myself would definitely go for one such escapade. We are running out of places to go. Getting a lil bored of the Little India eateries and Puncak. I need to go read up the makansutra book. Anyone got a copy?

      Its been a hectic week i guess. Many things happened and many issues arising, i've been too lazy to blog most of the time. Still, I prefer not to elaborate. I believe some things are just better left unsaid, and i like to let time do its wonders, to heal the pain whatsoever. And also, some things SHOULD just be left unsaid, coz if you go against nature, things will never be as before.  Thankfully, there are some really special people in my life whom despite all the insanity going on out there, are able to keep me sane. I would like to thank some of them here, coz you guys bring more than just a smile unto my face.   Didi and Nini :  You girls are just the sweetest, and as i have said it before, just looking at you 2 brightens up my day tenfold. And nini, your massages rock.   Sophia :  You've been there listening to me every single time unconditionally, and being such great company, love you sis.   Khai and Su :  You 2 are the only people who are able to crack me up every single time, even when im crying my guts out.   Denise :  Momma you are my bestest friend and im glad to say that your constant nagging has, over the years, become music to my ears. =P Miss you!   Wayne :  Last but not least, my dear bro. Through all the ups and downs, despite you being such an ass at times, you know that i love you. And i thank you for your care and concern and support and encouragement (be it in terms of $$, or gifts, or treats, or $$) *chuckle*

      What is yours, will be yours. What isnt, will never be. Sounds familiar? Everybody always live by this saying. Is there any truth in that at all? So many times in my life, things have always been going smooth. things going my way. i had what seemed rightfully mine. Yet, time and again, it always seem that someone is out to snatch what seemed to be mine. I like to share stuff, but some things are not meant to be shared. certain things in life can never be shared. so some people would tell me the above saying. And i refuse to agree with it.  Yes, i have always lived my life a selfless person. i always put others before myself. Does that mean that i have no right to be selfish for even a moment? Even when it means losing what was mine? Am i wrong to be feeling this way? I truly believe that whatever i'm talking about, has my name written all over it. Why do people always want to steal it from me? And right under my nose? I'm already living the life worse than a loser. You guys have everything, i don't. Can't you all just be contented and leave, what is mine, alone?

      God is infallible, impeccable, and absolutely perfect. Pity, that life (or rather, we) is(are) not. No matter how mighty we think we are, no matter how strong we try to be in life, we have to face the hurtful truth, that life is not infallible. that life is not impeccable. that life is not absolutely perfect. We are not God. However, this is where it all falls in place. If we were all to have perfect lives, wouldnt there be many Gods? Then what would that make the Almighty God Jehovah Jireh? There is only one God. He may have thrown many encumbrances at us, but isnt it true that through these turmoils, we actually get to experience the heavenly Power of God's great love? Through all this, we get to understand the ways of God, and we actually learn lessons that lead us towards infallibity, impeccability, perfectness, all that God is. We will never be Him, but we can be like Him.  Wayne just informed me that Dawne's dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. I was really shocked. All the good people are getting the shit, yet the bad (like me) are getting away. Been through Uncle Peter's ordeal last year and it was painful to see him go. Wayne told me he didnt know what to do. i told him "just show care and concern and support." More importantly bro, just Pray. to God. Pray to Him with a truthful and selfless heart. Trust me, (and trust Him) He is powerful. My dear friends, pls pray for Dawne's dad too. Thanks all.

      went down to TAS to pick up my last pay check. nubbad, they paid me the full month's pay for the lat 3 weeks of work. shweet! bought a cake to thank them for their drinks and treats, and also to celebrate belated-bday of dawn, early bday for Pam and Jeff.   I never knew the joy that a simple cake can bring to one, and the emotional effects of receiving one. You should have seen the smiles on the 2 girls' faces. oh man. i just felt so elated. the best moment of the day was when i received Jeff's msg afterwards. Really, the aftertaste of being able to touch someone's heart is too  beautiful . Ok,  beautiful  is not really a description of tastes, but who cares. Untouched from the original msgs :   Jeff:  Thks 4 the cake. It's been 9 yrs since i had my last b'day cake. Anyway, thks.     Me:  No probs man. All that matters is you all happy.     Jeff:  Hey fucking hell, now lesson can sms?!    That last bit was really hilarious.

CRM. pretty straight forward module. headed down to Toa Payoh for the last day of the Sch Nats finals with Irvin and Jame. Felt a little weird when we first stepped in. All the young unfamiliar faces around. Gone were all the old birds. But after awhile they all started flocking in. Caught up with many people whom i havent seen in ages. Leonard Yeo, for instant. Ya, Joscelin Yeo's brother. He still remembers me, which came as a surprise to me. whaha.. Got to see my dearest mei, U-nice. Havent seen her in like 2 years?! God it felt so good to see her. i missed you so much girl! whaha it definitely felt great to go back to the arena to catch up with the people. And yeah Jame, i'll call you up soon, for that game of pool.  Oh yah, mum just told me that she bought some shares for me. cool eh. SMRT shares. apparently they are distributing dividends next month, so i'd probably net in $900? the coolness of the whole thing is that i owe her about $1200, so she's actually buying shares for me to earn money to pay her back. whaha

      Yup that is the quote of the day, courtesy of Ravi. God, its been such a funny day.  School has not been that exciting since it started yesterday. My modules this sem are shit boring to the core. Almost every lesson is 2 hours of pure crap, i tell you even Einstein would fall asleep if he sat in my lessons. The only joy of school is that i get to see all my lovely classmates and juniors and friends i have missed for so long!  Went down to the gym today (after like 4 months of disappearance) and went over to the SP room to check out my lovely juniors. God i missed them so much! Especially didi and nini. There is just something special about this 2 girls. Everytime i look at them, a smile just pops onto my face, it brightens up my whole day, my heart just softens and i always succumb to their bullying. whaha.. Ran around all the machines just to get accustomed to working out again. Its so hard to get back to shape after 4 months of inactivity. Shit i hate this feeling. Now i gotta start all over again. Argh!

      Yea, the long wait is finally over. I don have to work anymore. Or at least for 1 year. Dr Lee bought us dim sum lunch at Wah Lok@Carlton Hotel yesterday. Dr Lee is like seriously the nicest gentleman ever to walk this earth. I simply cannot find the words to describe him. Juliana, you are one lucky girl.  Was at Eastside later on in the night with Jeff, while Pam and Dawn were at the Men's Health bash @ Newsroom. Yes they did not bring me along. dam. but still, i had a long chat with Jeff one to one, and he told me more of his life story, along with more lessons of life, which made me admire and respect him much more than before. He is like the perfect rebuttal to the popular belief that bad company destroys lives. Later on, we met up with Pam and Dawn at Siam Supperclub. I, personally (Jeff too), preferred Eastside. They had fantastic music, but since it was my last night out with them and the ladies were buying all my drinks, anywhere is good.  Mixed feelings now. Im really glad that its all over, and that i can actually concentrate on getting more sleep. Yet, im so gonna miss this 3 'brothers' (Pam Dawn and Jeff) whom i've been living with everyday for 11 weeks. All the best to you guys, and i promise i'll drop by if i have the time. Or hit Ice Cold Beer when YOU GUYS are free.

      Retail Therapy is really provocative and satisfying, yet it can get seriously out of hand and terrifying. I think i'm gonna need some help with controlling this unexplainable urge i have to shop. My final pay check (together with my OT compensation) will come in earliest on Monday, yet im already starting to buy stuff before the money comes in. Yes, im on credit. Ivan's credit, to be exact.  When i stepped into Orchard, the scene was quite a shocker. Either there was a party tonight at some club and people were decked out in their most clubbing apparels, ready for it, OR its just me not hitting town for too long a period. Seriously. Like, whoa.  Zara had this really great sale and i was already controlling my impulseness by considering for 10 minutes a blue shirt which i finally concluded that i could do without. But this really shweet grey short sleeve could not escape from my grasps and i fell in love with it the minute i laid eyes on it. Ivan thought otherwise but i don care. I still like it. wha..

Somebody pls help me.  Sun - Prayer and Praise went quite ok, considering that we only had one prac. Walked around town with Wayne and Dawne (his girl) before going for dinner with Mum and Dad.

Today - Just back from dinner with Jame and Pohie my momma at Sakae. Missed her so much ever since she left and i couldnt wait to see her at dinner! she's still the same, though abit noisier and whinier now ( right momma? =P ) but nonetheless, still the same. till we meet again, in like 5 months? oh man.. thats really long..

      to the max. Lethargicity was too overwhelming for me today. I simply did not had the strength and the mood to do any work at all. Not that anyone at work had. Guess its the post-event syndrome. Everyone is just dying for a break, yet we are not entitled to any. the after-effects of 2-weeks-of-17-hours-work-day, add to that the full-day-spent-working-like-hell-at-the-beach, top it all off with 6 bottles of wine and 2 cartons of booze. Lethargicity. There ya go.

       urlLink    This is my tentage, the Registration counter! and my 10 very hardworking volunteers!&nbsp   urlLink    all volunteers at their tentage&nbsp   urlLink    and another pic of them reporting&nbsp   urlLink    A beautiful Celica spotted outside the SSC office&nbsp   urlLink    from the back.. ooh..&nbsp  Yesterday was the Aquathlon Challenge! finally the day was here. Was a pretty hectic day for me. Being in charge of the registration counter, it was rather stressful as we sorta make or break the participants' day since we are the first line of staff to greet them. Had some minor cock ups here and there, and some really unreasonable participants, but nevertheless everything went rather smoothly. Was so busy that i never got to catch any part of the races and to take much pics. More pics will be up when i get them form Pam. Weather was pretty good in the morning and it held up till the end. A big thank you to my 10 volunteers from Hwa Chung who did a superb job! Kelly, Zesamine, Amelia, Su Ying, Geri, Boon Hui, Jessica, Jasmin and few others. Thank you all! You guys were absolutely great!  After that, we rushed back to the clubhouse for dinner. To celebrate the success of the event and also to celebrate Mark's (our president) bday. Jeff came down with his wife as well. There wasnt much booze around but lotsa wine and champagne. I seldom touch wine, so i was rather suprised at the kick that you actually can get from wine. Had a great night going crazy with Jeff, his wife, Charlie, Robert, David Hoong, Dawn and Pam. When the alcohol kicked in, our horses were let loose like hell! whahaha i knocked out the minute i got home. And i had one of the best sleeps in 2 weeks, even though im still dam tired now.  WeiYee talked to me today in church. Apparently my idea of having a once-a-month praise session got out to quite some people so she suggested we try kicking things off next week, coinciding with the prayer meeting. Exciting. Got quite a few people to prac on sat. Cant wait. Aiite, im hitting the bed once again.

      Starting to realise that the working world is a bad place to be in. So much shit you have to face. Sometimes you think you are doing the right thing. You innocently thought you were right (or you innocently made a tiny mistake), but somewhere along the line, someone comes and tell you you f**ked up big time. Its so hard to please people. The saying goes you cannot please everyone, yet it is already so difficult to please just one person. Chinese saying says work is work, personal is personal, yet knowingly, work will always get mixed with personal and its just so irritating. So many issues im facing now, so many concerns i have at work. Im on my toes almost every minute. Its really tough in the mind, to always have to remind myself again what to do, how to do, and in the end, a little mistake pops up and down i go. Sometimes i wonder, is it worth it to do so much? Am i even being appreciated? Are my efforts going unnoticed? Am i getting the credit i truly deserve?   Ok all this might not make much sense to you but its whole lot of shit jumbled up in me. i just have to let everything out, so that i feel better. Or, maybe Charlie could just quickly pay me the extra $ he suggested.

      Bored of having to think of titles so i just put shit up there. whaha.. well as usual, another 17-hour work day. i seriously have no life now. my life at this point of time revolves around work, work and work. I cant remember the last time i went out with friends. I cant remember the last time i caught a movie. I cant remember the last time i was walking down orchard shopping.  Have been having lotsa talks with Dawn and Pam and we concluded that TAS was a f**ked up place to be at working at, at the moment. Picture this, here in TAS : Sport and Wellness Diploma holder with 5 years working experience, workload requires 12-hours-a-day, getting paid LOWER than Civil Engineering Degree holder (no, there is NO link between civil engineering and sports industry. Period.) who sits on his ass 9-hours-a-day and bosses around people, at the same time screwing things up for everyone. A fair world, they call it.  Yes its official. My lecturer-adminstrator of my course, our dear Mrs Angela Tan, has left NYP. I swear, the value of my diploma just dipped tenfold, if not more. Oh well, she's better off elsewhere anyway. NYP is just too f**ked up for her. They are not worth her. This is a tribute to her. Mrs Tan, you are seriously the best lecturer i've ever had and i have the utmost respect for you. You made so much of a difference in SW and you were, you are, and you will always be the trademark of the SW course. All the best at your new place. We'll catch up one day. Good night all.

      Yea.. that spells it all out. I am getting really worn out. Not enough sleep, not enough time to recharge. i only spend 6 hours a day at home, and that includes sleep. I come to work like a zombie, at times even sitting there and being so spaced out. cant wait for the event to be over. still, there is so much to be done for post-event, but at least the major block is rid of. i cant wait to get my extra allowance, if its gonna be given. hoping..

      just came back from office. spent the whole day at SSC packing up the chips for Sat's race. After we were done, still had to come back to office to clear all the letters for posting to the participants (640, yes thats like freakin alot!) by tmrw! Dawn and Pam and i were like going crazy! but we had so much fun talking nonsense and sense, and Class 95's night show is just fantabulous! Great music!   17-hour working day has become such a norm for me now. Its really dam tiring. Only good thing is i might be getting extra allowance for all the OT i put in (which amounts to 30 hours as of now, since last wed) Pray hard! Still, i feel so bad not being able to company mum, especially since Dad is away and evynn is at swim camp, and Wayne's back in camp. That leaves her all alone at home. Argh!

Sat was the volunteers' briefing for next Sat's Aquathlon and everyone was rushing around for everything. Decided to have dinner with mum since i havent had a meal with her for weeks. The beautiful and calm ambience at Patara Thai restaurant was really soothing. The delicacies were totally irresistable. whee..   Got fed up with things at church. Really fed up. Sometimes i wonder, why do i even bother trying, why do i bother putting so much effort into doing things, only to see people write me off and deem my presence as irrelevant. Well, for God, i say. Yes, i admit, i wasnt even bothered with church stuff in the past. But, cant people change? cant i change? Had a really long talk with Soph, and i thank God for her. She's the one who was there to open up her ears to listen to me and advise me. Thank you so much dear. Love ya.

      just had a rather long chat with mum. was good. havent been talking to her much recently, due to the long hours i spend at work. she shared her problems with me and i just made her laugh with my stories at work. we both enjoyed that 1 hour. some more, dad is away, so all the more it was meaningful for me to spend time with her.   Another long day spent at work. just like the previous days, left work at 11pm. supper with Dawn and then free cab home (courtesy of TAS =P ) Past few days have been really enoyable, though tiring. Working so closely with Dawn for 14 hours a day, its been so much fun. Being so buried within the huge stress around us, we have to force ourselves to enlighten each other and the nonsense and noise we create during work simply helps put us at ease. by the way, my New Balance shoes arrived today. Nice! post it up tmrw.  3 more weeks till the end of attachment. sigh it'd be so sad to leave. and Dawn is so gonna die. Coz after i leave, she wont have a personal assistant anymore. hehe oh Dawn and Pam booked me for drinks on the 1st! before i leave. Cant wait! =P

      in hokkien, that'd go like "zhui gong lam pa song". Its the only phrase i can use to describe the biggest f**king asshole in the whole wide world, the Mr-all-time-cocking-up things-bastard Woon Long. (the worst colleague anyone has in TAS, btw)  Seriously, there are actually such people out there. Stupid, cock-sucking, good-for-nothings who cannot get anything done but act super egoistic-ly. MR Big-Shot Woon Long is one perfect example.  When he has no backing, he is like a freaking hamster (hamster = slang for a hum-ji person) Yes. He will whimper and frail. When he has a little bit of authority backing him, he will curry favour that figure of authority with every single curry there is in the world, and he will f**king turn around and shoot everyone down, regardless of whether he is in the right or wrong, just like he did at the last meeting. I have never seen such a personality change, of this high a degree, in my whole entire life. The worst thing is, he has no evidence to back his bossy-f**king-irritating actions. Absolutely nothing.  I never gave him any respect since i stepped into TAS. He didnt deserve to be given any. I did give him a little bit of respect for him being a human. Now, even that, i am taking back. Looking at him, i am utterly disgraced to be a guy. If i were him, my balls would have rolled off me ages ago.

I've been working straight from 9am this morning till now (its 1.55am now. yes its been 17 hours of work). its shit man. havent caught dinner. stress sucks, seriously. im tired. im weary. but things, lotsa things, have to be done. Add to that, i have to face some pathetic stupid asshole's face and dumb requests. Argh.   Joss Stone has been accompanying me for the past 3 hours of work. She's just fantastic.

      you know there are those kinda days where everything seem to run so nicely, then right at the end, SMACK! something pops up and just ruins everything? yea shit happened.  morning went for a meeting at New Balance to settle the staff apparel stuff with Philip, then later on had a discussion together with Arthur (the big boss of NB S'pore) about Corporate Tri in Oct. Was so excited over it. Dawn was like suggesting she do the proposal and i do presentation, i was like OK! whahaha.. oh yah i ordered a pair of shoes. Retail's like $119. i got it for $71! Whahaha.. shioky.. Dawn was offering me part-time at TAS when sch starts. hope my timetable will allow for that (think she has become too dependent on me after i started attachment here whahahahaha!)  Back in the office, i was flooded with paperwork. entries were pouring in like shit and so many (many means like every 5 mins someone comes!)people were coming to the office to register. For the second time, i felt so busy (and in other words, i felt useful whahaha) and anyway, right smack at 5.50pm, it came to our attention that $100 was missing from the cah box. I was like, oh shit. Even after many rounds of calculating, the money never resurfaced. Dawn has to make up for it and i felt so shitty and bad. It could have been my fault, i didnt lock the drawer one day and somebody could have just stolen it. i dunno. anyway its so anti-climax. think i should share the burden with her. afterall, we are partners. sigh left work only at 8pm. what a way to end off such an eventful day for me. sigh.  Oh and to add to all that, England lost. Argh.

       urlLink    Ronaldo concedes a penalty to the Greek.&nbsp  Yes. The host country crashed to a surprise 2-1 defeat at the hands of the unfancied Greece. Lady Luck was definitely not smiling on the Portuguese last night. As early as the 6th minute, Greece marked the scoreboard.   Even by bringing on Cristiano Ronaldo and Deco at half time, the Portuguese did not seem to be more of a threat. Ronaldo gave away a penalty shortly after coming on and it was 2-0. Still, Ronaldo was the most hardworking player throughout, making hard and long runs down the left flank, making crosses into the penalty area, only to see no one finishing the job. Try as they might, the Portuguese just could not penetrate the Greek defence. In the closing minutes, Ronaldo headed a late consolation goal for the home team from Figo's corner.  Today had quite a discussion with Soph, Bryan, Joyce and Evan about our worship stuff. How we could liven up the service, how we could make our worship better and more pleasing. Yet, i was disheartened to hear them affirm my views that the congregation was simply not being supportive and sad to say, many people come to Church for the sake of coming, and not to worship God. Plans are on the way to revamp our service. Just pray that we are able to make the change and make things turn around.   urlLink    an old-but-stylo Honda Civic EG-6!!&nbsp

      Its been about 6 weeks since attachment has been going on and today was the first time i was on my feet the whole day. So busy, i was, that i didnt have lunch. Pam and Dawn were out for meeting the whole day, which meant i had to pretty much be in charge of everything at the clubhouse.   In the morning was with Dawn at IKEA to buy mirrors and all. back to the office to clear lots and lots of paperwork the whole afternoon. entries are pouring in like crazy for Aquathlon. ( urlLink  here   for forms) Add to that the phone queries for the OSIM Tri, supervising the workers drilling on the stuff and signages, *poof* one day (without lunch) was gone.   Gotta go back tmrw to fix the pool. Jeff was supposed to do it with me 3 weeks ago but till now, every saturday he has been "dua-ing" me. Every single time, he would try to cajole me with his Toa Payoh Blk 125 Malay Food Stall. And every single time, the beef lungs, friend chicken, chicken and beef rendang, potato cakes and ikan bilis will make me forgive him. i've got a hunch i'ma get another treat tmrw *chuckle*

      Pretty hectic day. Work work work. argh.. Internet is still down at work and its seriously taking a heavy toll on everyone's workload. everything is just piling up but we cant do anything at all. Lunch was on Jeff today (whats new.. whahaha) at our latest hangout, Blk 125 Toa Payoh Malay food stall.   Spent like half the day wandering about Sim Lim with Dawn looking for shit to fix the modem, to no avail. Back to the office to do up all the paperwork for Aquathlon till 8pm (fyi, my working hours is 9-6) to satisfy some stupid idiot up there.  Whenever i swear, even the most vulgar word i use will always mean nothing. Yet, right now whenever i say   stupid  , such a simple word actually carries such a heavy meaning. Yes. Some people out there are seriously plain   stupid  . My usage of the word   stupid   right now can actually replace all the other vulgar nouns in my dictionary. It means much more than words like   f**k   or   asshole   etc. Period.  In a rice warehouse, there is a rat running all around every night, nibbling at rice sacks and contaminating the contents. What does the owner do? He counts the number of rice sacks being attacked every night and takes note of it. Does this make any sense at all? No. Shouldnt he be looking for a suitable cat to come and tackle the mouse? Yes he should. But is he doing so? No. That, is   stupid  , for you.

In other news, talked to Dawn yesterday and we might be making a trip to Port Dickson for the Port Dickson Triathlon from 9th-11th July. Its supposedly one of the better races in SEA. I was elated to hear that. havent been on a holiday for a year and a half already. cant wait. Some more, its Port Dickson. Whoo.. My long awaited beach-trip. whahaha.. Oh yah Mark, our president, got Gold for his IPPT and got the $400!! so its lunch on him tmrw at American Club! Whoopee!! Im gonna whack him so hard! hehehe..

      was at the hospital the whole night. grandma got admitted for heart problems. was reading the rather outdated copy of 8days and came across something rather hilarious:  10 things we would never know if not for Hollywood Movies  1. Kitchens have no light switches. When they open the fridge door, the only light that shines out is the only light they use.  2. Any tappings or flashing of lights are bound to be Morse codes and there will ALWAYS be someone around who knows how to decode them.  3. Spaceships can only fire at their foes when they are in visual range. Even though weopons that are able to shoot down your enemy without seeing them had been invented in the 21st century, people in the future just seem to forget all about this technology.  4. In any sports movie, the player can look up into 1 billion spectators and supporters and VERY EASILY spot their loved ones out.  5. Detectives can only solve cases AFTER they get suspended.  6. In VACUUM space, noises from battles can actually be heard and laser beams be seen,  7. Those who hate each other at first sight, will end up in love.  8. During quick escapes, there will always be a drainpipe right outside the teenagers' window, which would be strong enough to bear all the weight.  9. Every grocery bag will have at least 1 french loaf.  10. Break ups can always be resolved by chasing the other down the street, embarrasing them at their workplace, or turning up at the airport just before they are about to board their flight.  cool eh?

      it has been a beautiful weekend. friday and saturday night was spent at the Festival Of Praise. the atmosphere was just great. I foregoed an outing out with my friends on saturday for the FOP session that day and i never regretted that decision. The cost of being touched by God and feeling his Spirit and receiving all his blessings is just priceless.  Hillsongs' performance and leading of praise was superb and you could just feel God's presence right there and then. It has really lifted me up. Truly enjoyed myself and i definitely feel closer to God.   God works in many different ways, and the way he has changed me is so great that even i am shocked at the changes. its been like 360 degrees change spiritually and its scares me that He is really so powerful.   Saturday after work, had lunch with Jeff and Pam. We had a 3hour talk and he just shared so much stuff with us. really opened my eyes to the world out there. belting out lines and lines of life's philosophies, i was just awed at his knowledge and sensibility. oh well, im oxidising my hair now, after 2 years of black hair. whahaha.. will post up pics from the weekend soon when im free. till then, tata

      On my way to work, on the bus, there was a pregnant lady who boarded at the interchange, together with me. We got on the bus as the last few peeps, so obviously there were no more empty seats. i proceeded to stand at the standing area, she walked further into the bus. For the whole 40 minute bus ride, no one offered her a seat. When the bus was shaky and she stumbled a lil, my heart gripped. Still, no one offered their seats. No one even bothered looking at her, in case she falls or what. The sight of this is just horrigible.  How selfish can Singaporeans get? No wonder even Singaporeans condemn Singaporeans. Simple basic courtesy, yet supposedly-intelligent-people like the Singaporeans cannot even do the kind act of offering their seats to those who need it. Not like this happens once in a while. I have already seen 3 poor pregnant ladies having to stand the entire bus ride in 2 weeks. Sick. Makes me sick to realise after all this that I am also a Singaporean. Urgh. You discourteous infidels are a disgrace.

      Mark, our president, came back today! everyone were on their toes. haha spent the whole day looking at the com, which really makes one tired. slept on the bus so comfortably that i was thinking of foregoing my evening run. i shook myself and dragged my ass down to the roads. now i feel satisfied. heh..  Life at TAS (Triathlon Association of Singapore) is getting so much greater. Why? coz i save alot of money. whahaha so far, have been getting lotsa treats from Dawn, Pam and Jeff. Just on Tuesday, lunch was on Dawn. Drinks and cigs at night were sponsored by Dawn again. That day, i spent nothing. zilch. zero. Wonderful, ain't it?  Coming to TAS has really opened up my eyes. The people i met are great. The New Balance Sales fella, Philip, was a great contact (for future cheap purchases =P), David Sim from Sports Council was a great experience. Young fella, yet holding a senior post, and really knows his stuff. respect. Pam, my colleague, is 27 yet we could click quite well, talking serious and cock stuff. Mark, my president, is a hunky-rich-30yrold-looking 40odd yr old guy. He is just a superb president. He does so much for the Association and does it superbly. And of coz my boss, Dawn. She is just so good to work with. Click so well, and she's shown me so much and taught me so much. Last but not least, Jeff, our ah beng contractor. He's an english speaking ah beng. He is seriously the most nonsensical guy i know, other than botak, ian and zhiwei. He never fails to crack us up really badly when he drops by the office or bring us for lunch. Jokes aside, he is a very sensible and mature guy whom i really have deep respect for, just like botak. He is superbly nice and among all i have met so far, he deserves my utmost respect for who he is. peace.   urlLink    Jeff's Integra Interior&nbsp  Looking forward to Festival of Praise this weekend. Tmrw would be going with Ivan and hopefully Erica. Saturday with the church peeps. dunno why but i just felt like going for both nights. Praising Him is such a beautiful and lovely thing. Whoo! Speaking of his works, I got my results last week. was kinda glad that i cleared all, (coz seriously, last sem was my slackest sem in terms of attentiveness in class and lectures) but still abit pissed about not getting any As. was like expecting at least 1 or 2 of them. end up, none. still, 2 Cs and 5 Bs are a commendable effort already. whahaha.. Thank you God.

      finally decided to do up a brand new blog. no more fancy stuff layout and all. cant be bothered already. whaha just could not do without blogging. i had nowhere to cry and complain too when things get so bad. its been about a month or even longer since i last blogged. so much things have happened. and its all still inked in my mind, so YES im gonna make this a really LONG blog. im gonna update everything that i can remember of. whaha hang in there.  Havent been getting as much sleep as i wanted to. every night its only like 5 hours of solid sleep, which is a far cry to the usual min. 8 i need. its taking a huge toll on me.  God has been changing me so much in the last few months. Through out my fight with the almighty cigarettes, God has shown that he is even mightier than them. If not for Him, i could never have conquered this habit by myself. the fight is still not over, temptations still arises, but i know that He will continue to help me. Thank you God, i love you.   urlLink    Cat. me and Li Huan at the airport&nbsp  Cat and Lihuan are in Tokyo right now for mission trip. another 16 days before they are back. sigh i miss them so much. i feel so much for their trip this time. have been companying them and praying and supporting them so much, its the most i have ever done for anyone going for mission. come back quick girls!  Work has been alright. getting a wee bit boring but its still holding up. things are heating up. event is drawing near. my boss has been still good. we're getting closer, thanks to the people we are around and also thanks to drinks. hehe..  recently some of you have might already known, my bro has gotten himself a girlfriend. yes finally. im supposed to feel happy for him, yet i hate it. i don talk to his girl coz i am very in fear of portraying a wrong image. its hard to explain but in short, i cannot talk to her at all. so one fine sunday, before church, he actually asked me to go for a run that afternoon. i said sure. 4pm. so after church i accompanied cat and lihuan to do last minute shopping and he went home. i came home at 3.50pm, expecting to change and then go for that run with him. he suddenly told me to wash her tupperware and then told me he was going to climb pathetic bkt timah hill with her and her friends. i was like WTF? like whatever.  then just past sunday, we went to wesley. after that i accompanied them to sim lim after the service. bad mistake. i felt worst than a fish out of water. worst idiot ever. i was like a freakin dog, lappin behind my master and the girl. so at one shop, i went in while they stood outside. i msged him and said im leaving. when i looked around, they were already walking off to other shops, as if i was non-existent. he didnt even read my msg. only after i left the building and boarded a bus home, 3 minutes into the bus ride, then he called and asked where i was. like whatever.  today, being a public holiday, i expected him to stay out with that girl the whole day. and he did. i never spoke a single word to him today, only shouted at him when he came home to use the com before going back to camp and the com cocked up big time. i feel sick talking to him.  why do things have to turn out like that? im his brother. i looked up to him so much. i respected him so much. i spoke so much good of him in front of others, even covering up so much shit for him. yet, he treats me the total opposite. the only thing he does for me is give me money. im so disappointed. utterly. i dunno why he turned out this way. sigh thankfully, i have my friends. i love you guys for being there for me.

      haven't blogged in a while, but theres much to write now. granted its much ado about nothing, but isn't that the case usually? much ado about nothing.  isaac called me last night and asked where was nice to chill out and i said 'hey why not go to ice cold beer' and he say 'hey why not?' so i assumed he went there and when i reached to meet them there i saw them sitting outside ice cold beer on the curbside squatting and when i suggested ice cold beer well i didn't quite mean it that way and thats about the 2nd most hilarious occurance last night, 2nd of course to the events that proceeded it at Rouge (ex-milieu). but before i proceed, let me justify our actions to subvert unneccessary embarrasment on our part.  'the plan', as all plans teenagers concoct, failed to fall through due to some parties falling out (i.e. Weims & gang) or some other reasons which in this case, don't apply. so planless and out about town with too much time and too little to do, our original intention of going to zouk having been axed, we really were at a loss. if you're familiar with your orchard geography, then you'll know that ice cold beer is near Rouge! which is how we ended up there. it sounded good enough- $8 entry with one free drink. who's to complain? the catch- of course theres a catch!- is that it was a NUS engine fac bash!   inside they were all crowded on the dance floor doing NUS chant and cheers, which is horrifying enough, but afterwhich they obediently sat on the dance floor to watch those retrospective videos school-spirited people are so fond of with the obligatory songs from rock pop-dom (i fail to recall the exact songs). horror of horrors, but no, it doesn't end there. when the music does start and they start dancing, well, i shan't be scathing but let me quote isaac- "I've never seen so many bad dancers in one place. Lennard, they're even worse than you when you first started!", and for those who know of my embarrasing early dance floor fiascos, well, this time, it was even worse.   as of late, i've been feeling kinda under the weather what with a cough and blocked nose and itchy eyes and today i went to see the doc and its a bit disturbing that the medicine he gave he came with large stickers on the box saying- 'Caution! Poison!'. sure if i'm 6 feet under i doubt i'd have cough or running nose or itchy eye but then being 6 feet under opens up a whole new can of worms, doesn't it? so if you see my pretty mug in the obits any time soon, well, you know what happened.  unless of course, i die during NDP, which is tomorrow and im so excited that it'll be over that i may just lose control over my bladder, but it also puts me in fear of a terrorist attack! if they bomb the place, i hope its not when i'm doing my segment. soon it'll oh so over and i'll be oh so happy and then maybe i'll stop complaining so much about NS.   and this is for the army guys- i found a shop that sold bars of prickly heat soap! can you imagine? i bought a bar and i'll get back to you if it still gives the same tingly sensation. ah. prickyl heat power. air-con in a metal tin, its heaven i tell you!

      after weeks and weeks of not seeing them, my friends are in worse state than i thought they were. some worse than me even. NS has this numbing pain on everyone, its inexplicable. its. its the forceful surrender of one's liberties, and now i see why papillion wanted so much to be a free man even though life on his colony wasn't half bad, simply because a man needs his liberty. i may not ever take a ballet class or become a nurse in my lifetime, but i damn well would like to option to do that if ever i damn well wanted. and don't tell me after 2 years, because 'after 2 years' still doesn't address those 2 years.   ah Jack White said it well- 'life is soo boring, its really got me snoring...'   its very sad when i see my friends get high and drunk all to forget for a moment that they're a national slave, and despite the hangover we know we will get and the long term damage and everything else, we know its worthit. just for that moment.   ride the wind baby. ride the wind and never turn back again.   p.s. most of my entries are all going to be along the same vein of NS and how it loathe it and bla bla bla so if you're reading for entertainment purposes, check back in feb 2006.   and such, heres the pic- http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/6403278/ no digital manipulation save for a bit of tweaking of colour. and thats your back.

      2001: A Space Odyssey. Every critic worth his own salt would have seen and raved about this phenomenal movie. 'Beautiful to watch from start to finish!' says one, and everyone else alike. And perhaps they can get away with it precisely because the movie plods along so slow, that almost everyone and anyone who watches it would fall asleep, and hence cannot argue with the reviewers comments. but in all honesty, it is a beautiful movie. absolutety lovely, with very restrained pacing. its poetic la.   has anyone else seen it? remember the scene where all the astronauts are on the moon uncovering the monolith? it looks like they all have large gaping cheebyes.   in camp, warrick was complaining about loud and stupid malays. Rant rant rant rant rant. how oh he hates them and oh how they should just shut up (i agree, btw). and the hilarious part- he ends it with saying- "Fuck la! if they keep bothering me, next time i'll bring pork floss and toss it like confetti! see what they can do!" haha?  haha.  we are all assigned with a 2000-3000 word essay to write for some commissioner essay competition. some of what we write is absolutely hilarious. i for one, ended my essay with 'majula singapora'.   oh singapore oh singapore how i love thee.

At zouk, it was so packed and as traffic funneled me through phuture i couldn't help but utter a 'moo' and laugh to myself.   disillustionment is when you know things seem bleak and that theres nothing you can do about it. or is that part depression? either way it ain't pretty.

       David Lynch? What's happening to me?   I've been on a  urlLink David Lynch  kick. I can't stop watching his movies. Over the past week I've watched  Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Drive . I'm either slightly more insane since this movie watching adventure began, or a little bit better because of it. I never thought I'd get into his films. My first two years of college were spent at a liberal-hippy-commie-artsy-school where "being into" Lynch was hip, so out of spite I only watched one of his films and didn't pay much attention. Living in the woods and having oodles of free time and no one to be cooler than has given me the opportunity to really appreciate what he does. Worth checking out!

       The War, Iraq, Bush, etc.   Quick rant: Though I would not describe myself as a "liberal" and in no way subscribe to the "liberal agenda" in America, I have to say that I find the current occupation of Iraq and the actions of our president to be disgraceful and thoroughy dishonest. To many, I'm just pointing out the obvious, but this is my rant so I can be as obvious as I want. More obvious facts:   -The greatest success of our president has been in making a connection between the events of 9/11 and the former Iraqi government, a connection which does not exist.   -Stemming from this lie was the lie that WMDs are in Iraq and are an imminent threat to world stability. Based on this second lie, a justification for invading Iraq was manufactured and sold to the American people.  - The American people, incidentally, have the memory capacity of goldfish...as a majority of Americans continue to support this war even though the two lies which provided the only justification for war have been exposed.  -Between 8 and 10 thousand innocent lives have been lost in Iraq as a result of our invasion. About 3 times as many as were lost in the 9/11 attacks. Innocent life is innocent life, no matter how you slice it. It's all valuable. So, based on two lies and a vague notion of "justice" we were sold a plan of action which resulted in more innocent bloodshed than the attack which prompted any US action. Despite this, nothing has been accomplished to bring real justice for the 3,000 victims of 9/11. Instead, we're hated even more by the world which will only result in more attacks.  -What the hell are we doing supporting the Zionists in Israel? That's half our problem, but that's obvious.  - We have become an Empire, straying far from the original concept of Republic. Get out your 10th grade history books....now....what happens to all Empires?  - Following Septemeber 11th we had the  urlLink support of the whole  world. For the first time in decades people sympathized with the United States. Bush took that sympathy, possibly our last chance at building solid relations with the world community, and destroyed it. Within two years, we have become more hated than at any other time in history.   - We need a new president, but Kerry is nothing more than Bush"light", and a third party candidate will not be elected. Some may argue that Bush is pro-life, pro-religion, etc. These are all good things. I say this is should be a secondary consideration at this point in choosing a president. The fate of our nation is in the balance at this point. The hatred around the globe that is felt for us must be our primary concern. We've gotta fix that...quick. Besides, Bush will never push to overturn Roe V. Wade, as it would damage his career too much.   My thoughts.

        FAITH    Lately I've been questioning the motivation behind my beliefs. I know for certain this questioning will not lead to a complete overhaul of what I know and understand to be true but, God willing, it will lead to a deeper knowledge and understanding of who I am, and what my motivations are- particularly in the "religious" sense.  The other night trying to fall asleep I found myself restless....kept awake by the idea that I'm a cheater, that I'm insincere, that my attempt at a spiritual life is being kept alive by nothing more than self-motivation and ego.  I began to ask myself - "Why do I make attempts to worship God in the Orthodox Church?"  Is it the need to feel superior to the "other half" who live without the Church. Is it a feeling of belonging which drives me? Is it a psychological need, possibly stemming from  my personal experiences, which has led me to attempt feebly to approach God?Is it a desire for some kind of mystical experience which will deliver me from the monotony of day to day life?  Is it the fear of death and final judgement? Do I only call on God in times of need- reducing God to a wish-giver of sorts? Is my religion a  crutch ?  If these things are true... then my Christianity is fake- it is a thin and cheap facade only existing to satisfy myself, not God.  If this is true, then perhaps the critics of "organized religion" are correct, at least about me and my ego driven self-satisfying motivations.  My former priest used to say frequently:  "We must become less, so that He may become more."   Is my Christianity an emptying of the self, or is it pleasing to the self in its comforting concepts, its ritual, its talk of Church life which foster feelings of self-importance.   God preserve me from the superficial, so that I may worship  in  Truth  and in self emptying  Love .

      Ah, and now something for April. A bit of T.S. Eliot's  The Wasteland    April is the cruelest month, breeding 	Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing 	Memory and desire, stirring 	Dull roots with spring rain. 	Winter kept us warm, covering 	Earth in forgetful snow, feeding 	A little life with dried tubers. 	Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee 	With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade 10 	And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, 	And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. 	Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch. 	And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's, 	My cousin's, he took me out on a sled, 	And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 	Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. 	In the mountains, there you feel free. 	I read, much of the night, and go south in winter.
