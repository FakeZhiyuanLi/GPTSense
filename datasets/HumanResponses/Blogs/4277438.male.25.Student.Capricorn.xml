      Well I went to the Warehouse last night - just for a good look around, of course. I picked up a couple of new dvds,  urlLink Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  and  urlLink Old School . They are both pretty good films - but Old School has a few flaws - makes me laugh, though. I'm thinking about buying a digital camera - maybe I can add a few images to this blog. I'll have to dig into my savings, though. I seem to have caught a chest cold. I hope I can shake it off quickly.

      Bad news. Edvard Munch's "Scream" has been  urlLink stolen . I always liked that picture, I hope the culprits are captured and that one day I will get the chance to see it in real life.

      Ok.So last night and the night before that I played Monopoly. On a Friday and Saturday night I played Monopoly. I didn't go out on the town, I didn't see a movie, I played board games. Not really the most wild thing to do for a man of 25. And to increase the geek-factor by a hundred or so, it wasn't just regular Monopoly - it was  urlLink Star Wars Monopoly . On the other hand, if it's cold and you're broke then it's not the worst way to spend an evening, especially if you're enjoying a few beers and some barbecued meat products while you're playing. I didn't win either game - Lliam, one of my flatmates, won last night and I think (though I'm not certain) he won the night before too. It gives us a break from watching the Olympics on tv - although I'm pleased to say that New Zealand is finally on the medal table - a  urlLink gold  in the rowing for the women's doubles sculls. The Evers-Swindell twins are pretty cute. Broad shoulders, though. Believe it or not, N.Z. is currently ahead of Canada on the medal table - which has two silvers and a bronze, but no gold. That will probably change, though.

      I've tried several times in the past to create a blog and every time I have fallen at the first hurdle. I don't know whether that's because I've bored myself silly with it, or whether I just have a short attention span. Anyway, I thought I'd start off with that universal topic of conversation - the weather. I live in Wellington, New Zealand and the weather this week has been  urlLink crap . The flat suffered a power cut on Tuesday night due to a lightening strike and it was impossible to drive into town - fortunately I had no seminars scheduled at varsity. But I'm glad I don't live in  urlLink Florida  or in  urlLink Boscastle , England. At least they're having good weather in Athens, although the place does seem a bit  urlLink smoggy  from what I saw watching the rowing the other day. Since New Zealand has yet to win a single medal at the Olympics this year, I'm prepared to blame it on the pollution.
