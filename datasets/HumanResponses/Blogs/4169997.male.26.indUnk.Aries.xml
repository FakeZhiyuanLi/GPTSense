       Things do eventually work out...       Right now, I'm listening to BT's soundtrack to 'Monster' - 5.1 surround music. That new album aside, the man really is an astounding musician.       The weather in Canberra has finally warmed up it seems. It was almost ok to walk around in a t-shirt! There was several mini skirt sightings throughout the day - ahh the joys of summer here! :)       Had a fairly quiet Friday night, revisiting the old gig, Minque in Manuka, It was good to a few old mates, have a beer and talk some crap.       Driving back towards the city I had an interesting conversation with the Mr Foo. We were discussing whether dance music holds the same sort of underground appeal for teenagers as it did to us when we were younger. I feel it probably doesn't, dance music is all around - TV / Shops / Radio, it's inescapable. I don't think it was quite the same a few years ago, but I guess it's all perspective. Foo puts it down to technology - the thrill of taping radio shows is gone.       When's the last time any of you guys recorded a great mix set? The feeling of satisfaction of finding that great tune is just no longer there - you can just post a msg on a forum, soulseek it, and wooshka. The achievement is just not there... but anyway, I'm probably rambling.       Saturday was pretty cool. Went for a big long walk around a few inner city suburbs with Milky, discovered some cool buildings, and philosophized about a million and one things :). Love Sat @ Academy had it's first ever guest DJ, Chris Wilson from   urlLink  Family   . Overall it was a hugely fun night. There were some great tunes played, and finishing the evening with all 3 of us sharing the last few hours was fun.       A girl offered to show us her boobs if we played a tune for her, unfortunately we didn't have the tune. A few hours later, she did it anyway :) - We even got to sign them! Yay! (they were very nice boobs) (for the message on the boob, check out   urlLink  academy's website    next Wednesday ... Quirky quirky night.       We spent the day today doing tourist things in Canberra, seeing the museum.. and well.. seeing the museum I guess.. wasn't much time for anything else considering we all woke up after midday :)       I've also done the sheep-like thing, and like the rest of the world, have finally bought 'The Da-Vinci Code'. Seems pretty interesting so far :) It's a nice break from Dostoyevsky.       Umm.. That’s enough mental dribble for now. I should go read some micro economic theory I think.    Ciao all.

       Hooray, economics exam went swimmingly ;)  Which brings me to Thorpie - YAY for the dude - how awsome is he? Tremendeously awesome I thinks!  I think I'm gonna get me some piano lessons soon. I guess it'd be right thing to do, considering I recently bought a digital piano :P ... loving good jazz at the moment.    Calle 54 (DVD) is an awesome experience - it's a doco in the same vein as Buena Vista Social Club - It focuses on Latin Jazz (Paquito D'Rivera, Chano Dominguez, Michel Camilo etc) Increadible music by increadible musicians. I discovered it by accident in my local video shop - it was one of those meal deal moments, and I needed to get one more weekly. Wanted something a little different, so I checked out the foreign section, and there it was. Was so good, I bought it shortly after.     Disjointed post no? Oh well...  Oooh, I held my first ever meeting as the boss of my team (7 ppl attended, one was missing). I think it went quite well. I'm finally feeling a lot more confident with the whole management thing. It was realy quite good to see positive reactions after the meeting.  Mmm.. that's it for now.  Ps: Spellcheckers are for wusses ;)

       Last night I saw a show about the building of federation square in melbourne.      The architects all wore business shirts, top button done up, but no tie.  Looked very 80s.      Can anyone tell me why this odd uniform?      Dre? ;)

        ..things are gonna get better!  Holly crap! Had he most insane night DJ wise. Every now and then we (myself and milky) manage to have a truly memorable set. Last nite that happened!  Did the usual set at Academy from 10-2,  with the usual results ;)  Then went on to lot with the Milkbar, and lordy lord, talk about vibe! Was chok-a-block full & they was jiiivin!  We layed down some real house music  - and we absolutely tore the roof off the m*f*  Choon of the night was deffo: ATFC's rmx of Keep Pushing On - 13 Minutes of diva tinged house glory. I've been playing this beast for a good 1/2 year at least, but last nite was probably the first time that it worked it's magic as a house monster. Much respect to ATFC.  Back to reality now, It probably wasn't the best time to pull an all nighter such as this. Economics exam is a mere 2 days away :s ... but hey... the ego needs a good stroking every now and then. Last night certainly delivered!  It's no wonder DJing can be such a selfish thing - when the crowd is responsive, when they feel those hot tunes they may not have heard b4 - that's a special moment.  Righto. Onto monopolies and oligopolies and all that fancy stuff.

        Yup... today feels like a Monday...     I won't get too philosophical cuz I am right this minute procrastinating ... i really should be taking out the trash and heading to Fraser's so we can watch Fahrenheit 911. A million opinions are already out there, but I'll add my 2c when I return. (I have no doubt I'll be biased in my review - I love mr Moore's work ;) )  2 Days of work, and man I wish I had a third. Not 10 minutes into the office and yet another drama confronts me. Daaaim. Apparently there was almost a 'fisticuffs' in my office. Should be a right f*ckin joy sorting that mess out then! :p Communication ppl! Communication - or lack thereof will be the downfall of us i say !      Classical work of the moment:  Rimsky-Korsakov  -  Sheherazade  Op 53. Lovely orchestral stuff. Hear it. Current CD that's doing my head in:  Involver  -  Sasha  - Could this be the CD that reintroduces me to progressive? To be continued...

       Dang, this is the second day my ass is @ home with a cold.      To all you clever people that escaped this fair city I say... u lucky f**kers! :P A winter with below zero temperatures , and no snow... Jibbed.      Speaking of Jibbed! How's 1 point away from a HD in marketing sound! On the one hand, I'm kinda stoked considering I would have been happy to pass.. but to do so well, and miss out on a HD by 1... well.. I'm just greedy i guess :)      I'm still working out this whole blog thing, but I'm hoping to have some photos up soon.      l8rz

       Simple really…        Over the years, my friends and family have managed to scatter themselves all around this lovely little planet, so I've decided to share whatever pops into my head at various times with all of you. While life in Canberra is not exactly 'a tornado' I think enough happens to make for a relatively fulfilling existence (and hopefully a read that is not too dull!)        So - this is pretty much all you monkeys that I love!
