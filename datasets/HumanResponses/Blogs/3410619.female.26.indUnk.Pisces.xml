      So I set up this blog and still can't figure out most of it, hehe.  I'll start out with where I'm at at this exact moment in my life.  Last Friday I joyously returned to the United States after a week long "vacation" in Nicaragua.  I went down there to meet my boyfriend's parents because his dad can't come to the states.  That's the last time I do that!  Though I didn't get kidnapped as expected, there's nothing about that country to enjoy. The absolute worst part about it is its capitol Managua.  What a shithole of a city.  The outlying country towns weren't too bad but the whole country can be summed up as one big trash dump.  For the most part the landscape and scenery is very similar to Southern California.  So I spent $500 on a plane ticket to see what I could have seen down the street.    To be fair, there were some good parts of my trip.  Meeting his family was fun.  Everyone liked me except dbf's bother's wife.  But she was just jealous of me because everyone catered to my every need or want.  It's what I get for being an American :o)  Chinandega was a cute, little, OLD town with sugar cane fields as far as the eye can see.  The couple of lagoons we visited were beautiful and the constant view of volcanos was pretty neat-o.  We spent the last 2 days at an all-inclusive resort down there that used to be the property of the former president of Nicaragua.  That guy was livin' good!  I admit, going to the resort was hardly roughing it but at that point I didn't care to see anymore poverty, garbage, dirty little begging kids, or anything but that private beach we paid to stay at!    I still have no desire to go back unless there is any way possible to get there without having to be anywhere near Managua.  In the week I was there I managed to see a dead dog, a dead horse, and a dead man.  The guy got hit by a car and was left to die like the dog in the street.  The horse fell over after starving to death.  And I can only imgagine the dog had the same fate.  It was just icky.  But I did it for the boyfriend.  So I'm not going to complain about my vacation anymore.  I've already been promised that it's my turn to choose the vacation next year.  And it won't be to a 3rd world country.
