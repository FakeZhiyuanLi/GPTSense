      There were times in my life when I thought true love wasn’t real, or at least not one of those things meant for me. But then you came along, and I found in you the love of my life… Just having you on my side has made a world of difference, and I look forward to sharing many wonderful moments with you.

      She walks in beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that's best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes:Thus mellowed to that tender lightWhich heaven to gaudy day denies.One shade the more, one ray the less,Had half impaired the nameless graceWhich waves in every raven tress,Or softly lightens over her face;Where thoughts serenely sweet expressHow pure, how dear their dwelling-place.And on that cheek, and over that brow,So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,The smiles that win, the tints that glow,But tell of days in goodness spent,A mind at peace with all below,A heart whose love is innocent!Lord Byron

      Homily of LoveW hen you think of your past love, you may view it as a failure. But when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love, it doesn't really matter who won or who lost. What is important is you know when to hold on and when to let go! You know you really love someone when you want him or her to be happy, even if their happpines means that you're not part of it. Everything happens for the best. If the person you love doesn't love you back, don't be afraid to love someone else again, for you'll never know unless you give it a try. You'll never love a person you love unless you risk for love.Love strives in hurting. If you don't get hurt, you don't learn how to love. Love doesn't hurt all the time. Though the hurting is still there to test you, to help you grow. Don't find love, let love find you. That's why it's called falling in love because you don't force yourself to fall. You just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing it's chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages. Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing. The greatest irony of love is letting go when you need to hold on and holding on when you need to let go. We lose someone we love only when we are destined to find someone else who can love us even more than we can love ourselves. On falling out of love, take some time to heal and then get back on the horse. But don't ever make the same mistake of riding the same one that threw you the first time.To love is to risk rejections, to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose true self, to love is to risk not to be loved in return. How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, hurt but never keep the pain.Love is like a knife. It can stab the heart or it can carve wonderful images into the soul that always last for a lifetime. Love is supposed to be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes the things that give you joy can also hurt you in the end.Loving people means giving them the freedom who they choose to be and where they choose to be. For all the heartaches and the tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, you should give thanks, for you know, that there were the things that helped you grow. Loving someone means giving him the freedom to find his way, whether it leads towards you or away from you.Love is a painful risk to take but the risk must be taken no matter how scary or painful, for only then you'll experience the fullness of humanity and that is love. Only love can hurt your heart, fill you with desire and tear you apart. Only love can make you cry and only love knows why. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not ready to take the risk, if you're not ready to feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in love. There was a time in our lives when we became afraid to fall in love coz every time we do, we get hurt, then I figured that's why it's called falling in love.When you decide to love, allow it to grow. When you promise to love, refuse to let it die!  Rendy Calvo

The ones who stayed behind began to talk about their > kids and their successes. The first guy says: I am very proud of my > son, he is my pride and joy. He started working at a very > successful company at the bottom of the barrel. He studied Economics and > Business Administration soon he was promoted and began to climb the > corporate ladder > becoming the General Manager and now he is the > president of the company. He became so rich that he gave his best > friend a top of the line Mercedes Benz for his birthday.  The second guy says: Damn, that's > terrific!! My son is also my pride and  joy, I am very proud of him. He started working at a traveling agency > for  a very big airline. He went to flight school to become a pilot and also  manage to become a partner > in the company where he now owns the majority of the assets. He became so rich that he gave his best > friend a brand new jet for his birthday.  The third guy says: Well, well, well > congratulations!! My son is also my  pride and joy and he is also very > rich. He studied in the best  universities and became an Engineer. > He started his own construction  company and became very successful and a > multimillionaire. He also gave away some thing very nice and > expensive to his best friend for his  birthday. He built a 30,000 sq ft > mansion specially for his friend.  The three friends congratulated each other > mutually for the > successes  of theirs sons.  The forth friend who earlier had gone to > restroom returned and > asked:  What's going on, what are all the > congratulations for? One of the three  said: We were talking > about the pride we feel for the successes of our  sons. And then he asked, What about your son? The forth man replied: My son is Gay and he > makes a living dancing > as a stripper at a nightclub. The three friends said: What a shame that must be, that is horrible, what a  disappointment you must feel. The forth man replied: No, I am not >  ashamed. Not at all. He is my son and I love him just as well, he is my  pride and joy. And he is very lucky too. Did you know that his birthday  just passed and the other day he received a beautiful 30,000 sq ft  mansion, a brand new jet and a top of the line Mercedes Benz from his  three boyfriends!!!!

      Nakakatawa how one falls in love then falls out  of it... It's funny rin how one would die looking for it, while one would just let it die...  It's  ridiculous how each and everyone of us is very much affected by love... And it's a wonder how everyone lives because of LOVE...  Well, here is a story...  In a dream, GOD told me, that I could pick up any man I like from His field.  BUT I have to choose only one.  Once na nakapili na ako, have to raise my hand as a signal that I finally found him, then go back to GOD for praise.  But NO!!!  May isa pang kondisyon -- I could never turn back.Once nalampasan ko, I should move on.  So sabi ko, GOD surely won't give me rotten crops of men.  I have been a good daughter and I deserve to be with a good man.  I was confident I'll get the best pick.  So my journey began.  As I went through the field, nakita ko ang iba't ibang klase ng lalake.  Some were tempting me to pick them up. And some were indeed tempting to pick up.   Pero sabi ko, baka may mas gwapo, mas mabait, mas matalino, mas masipag, mas mahal ako sa dulo ng field na ito. So I let go.  Once.  Twice. Thrice.  I believed fervently that in the end of the field is my prince, waiting for me with open arms.Then I saw a man.  He looked at me straight in the eye and blew a kiss.  Our gazes met and I don't know why, pero there was something in him that I longed for.  I felt as if something was drawing me to him.  Pero di pwede.  I have to make it to the end of the field.  Baka sabihin ni God , atat ako chaka wala akong patience.  Naisip ko If habang lumalayo ako, nakakakita ako ng ganitong klase ng lalake, baka as I move further eh may mas hihigit pa sa kanya.  Until, I reached the end of the field.  And wala akong nakita!!! GOD asked me, "Di ba napakakulit mo, araw-araw na ginawa ng Diyos...ay, ako pala yun... eh nagdadasal ka na magkaroon ng perfect partner in life, bakit ngayon wala kang dala.  My crops are all fresh and good.  There is  nothing there not ready and good for picking."  I answered, "I thought I would see someone at the end of the field .  Eh dyuskupo, wala na pala .   I thought that each step I took brought me closer to perfection when in fact, each step brought me closer to nothingness.  I remembered that man who was looking at me.  I know he's the one but I let him go, believing na there's someone better at the end of the field. Oh, darn it!"  God said, "I'm sorry my child, but I have given you enough time  to choose.  You should face reality and its consequences." With my head bowed down  I said, "I'm sorry   I wasn't brave enough to raise my hand in the middle of the field and commit myself to someone.  I was not ready to face the challenges of life with someone I thought was of lesser value than me...I'm sorry."  Nagising akong umiiyak, saying sorry to GOD and feeling sorry for my self and my life.  Then I realized that GOD is giving me another chance to choose but not in His field but in the field of uncertainty.  Now, I'm thinking about that man in the field, the man I felt was for me, wondering what might have been if I raised my hand the moment I saw him.  Then it hit me.  What is the meaning of all my hardship to be successful  and wealthy?    I may become the most powerful and successful person on earth but if I don't have that someone whom will I share my love and happiness with, then it will not be worth anything.  Para sa ating lahat 'to.  Think about it.  We are not getting any younger.  Explore GOD's field. I'm sure nanjan lang sha sa tabi-tabi.  Maaring in the beginning, in the middle or in the end. It's for you to find out.  But most importantly, it's for you to choose.  It's a part of the whole concept of love.  It's a risk you have to take, a decision you have to make.  And once you have decided on it, there's no turning back.  Bear in mind that with this comes the courage to raise your hand and declare that you've found your match, whether you're at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of your journey.  Or else, you'll regret it.  At ang huling phase ng lahat ng yan eh ito lang -- once you've raised your hand, go back to God and thank Him.  In short, maging kontento ka sa napili mo.  Ikaw naman ang pumili nyan eh.  All He did was to give you options.  And since He gave you that privilege, consider it a blessing.     "I would love to be married. It would be great to find  the one special person you want to annoy for the rest of  your life..."

      A story tells that two friends were walking  through the desert.  During some point of the  journey they had an argument, and one friend  slapped the other one in the face. The one who   got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything,   wrote in the sand:  TODAY MY BEST FRIEND  SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.     They kept on walking until they found an oasis,  where they decided to take a bath.  The one who had been slapped got stuck  in the mire and started drowning,  but the friend saved him. After he recovered   from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone:  T ODAY MY BEST FRIEND  SAVED MY LIFE.     The friend who had slapped and saved his    best friend asked him, "After I hurt you,  you wrote in the sand and now,   you write on a stone, why?" The other friend  replied "When someone hurts us we should   write it down in sand where winds of  forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone   does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone  where no wind can ever erase it."  LEARN TO WRITE YOUR HURTS IN  THE SAND AND TO CARVE YOUR  BENEFITS IN STONE.    They say it takes a minute to find a special  person, an hour to appreciate them, a day    to love them, but then an entire life  to forget them. Send this phrase to  the people you'll never forget.  If you don't  send it to anyone, it means you're in a  hurry and that you've forgotten your friends.  Take the time to live! Do not value the THINGS  you have in your life. But value  WHO you have in your life

      STAY IN LOVE  A couple had a grand 50th wedding anniversary celebration.  As was his habit the past 50 years, the husband cut and gave the end part of the loaf of bread to his wife. Suddenly, the wife burst into tears and exploded, "I can't take this anymore. Why do you always give me that part of the bread?"  The husband kept his peace and then looked at the wife with such loving eyes and said, "My dear wife, all these years, I have always wanted that part of the bread, but I thought you wanted it, so I made it my sacrifice every morning out of love for you, all these years." Lesson of the story? Sacrifice and communication.  After all these years, do you still sacrifice for each other and still really communicate with each other? Or has life become a sacrifice for both of you as you continually excommunicate each other? I wonder how many couples out there still hold each other's hands? Someone said that newlyweds hold each other's hands because of love.  After some years of marriage, they still hold each other's hands--out of self-defense! Do you still open the car door for the wife?  Elsewhere I read that if you see a husband opening the car door for the wife, there are two possible reasons.  One, maybe the car is new. Two, maybe, the wife is new. Or, have you heard about the couple who were so sweet that when the husband would come home from work, the wife and their dog would be waiting at the gate, and as soon as the husband alighted, their dog would come out barking and the wife would bring the slippers. However, some years later, as soon as the husband arrived from work, the wife would come out barking and the dog  would bring the slippers! What happened? What went wrong? They did not make their loving a daily decision.  They did not remain in love - maybe they did not remain in His love. How about love in our families? Do we remain in love as the years go by? The greatest wish of all parents is that their children live in peace and harmony and continue to move and care for each other, long after they are gone from this world. I have listened to parents whose hearts are broken because their children do not live in peace, do not speak to each other and go about living their separate lives. Worse, some of the children do not even care for the welfare of their parents. It pains me deep inside whenever I hear an old person confide to me his/her desire to go to the next life because the children don't call and don't care and don't even visit. Nobody has time to listen. Some are even shouted at and just simply taken for granted. They who loved us so much deserve our utmost love till the very end. Let us go back to basics. Love them now; express your love for them now while they are still alive. By Fr. Jerry M. Orbos, SVD  Excerpted from his article, "Moments"                Shared by Joe Gatuslao               Bacolod City, Philippines

        After the rain comes the rainbow. After the hurt comes the healing. unfolding gently, coming closer everyday, this is the natural way of things.Hard times soften and fade. Hope rises to the surface, and smiles gradually find their way to faces as reminders of some of the precious things tomorrow will surely bring. Life always leads into that direction. Too slowly sometimes, but towards to a more beautiful horizon. After sadness, rersolve. After weakness, so much strength. With time and patience as special friends, the tough times pass and the healing begins.In any difficulty you have known, your heart has always been home to an inner beauty and a special strength. There has been wisdom deep within you, and the more you turn to that wisdom now, the more it will see you through.When times are tough, i'll wish you strength enough to see you through anything. When the world brings you uncetainties of which way to go, i'll wish you comforting thoughts and guiding signs and an inner compass that will help you know. I'll wish you paths that is never too long or never too hard to travel; a road where help is there if you need it, and a journey that will bring joy to your spirit and peace to your soul.If you ever need a little reassurance that things will be going to be alright, i'll do whatever i can to remind you that.. as the rain dissapears, the rainbows will come again. Serenity unfolds gently, a little more each day, and the healing helps you realize that.. everything will be ok.*The secret of contentment? Doing things that are good for the soul.

      if this is all the timei can ever spend with youi'd live each day as though it would be the last,and then after the sun would seton each day of those days,i'd treasure the memoriesin my secret box of dreams-to be open when my heart is fullof longing of your presence...if this all the moment you could ever give to me,it would fill it with laughter and music,and every second that would thunder bywould resound in the silent cave of my thoughts...and each crystal tear that would break through my resolve when you're gone would be treasured for all its wortha gift of love,in a very precious gift of a moment...

      She could send ships to sea with her beauty.Lure Sailor with her spellbinding siren.Give the apathetic and array of emotions.The loner, a reason to tear down walls.The weak-hearted, cradled-comfort in her wings of compassion.A celestial aura accompanies her presence,Darkness with her disappearance.Her heavenly soul can be seen,Even when the tangible is gone.She resides in all heavenly things:Some in the sun,Slightly in the stars,Minutely in the moon,Partially in the planetsHigh in the heavens.   by Angel Adoration
