      you know what i'm the queen of?  making poor decisions!  yeah, that's right.  i feel as though, if i'm making a decision, whatever the worse possibility there is as an answer, i'll choose it.  i suppose i've learned something from all of my mistakes, and i wouldn't necessarily take any of them away... as i don't like to have regrets.  i make poor career decisions, i don't manage my time very well, i don't make good decisions regarding men, i push those away that i should keep close, and i keep close those that aren't good for me.  of course i'm exaggerating, and of cousre i'm all fired up right now so this whole thing is probably a bunch of BS, but that doesn't take away from how i'm feeling right now.  right now i feel as though i must always fall on my face in order to learn.... maybe 3 times.

      this post is probably going to come out sounding very bitchy, and i suppose i'm intending it to be, because that's how i'm feeling.  i am SO frustrated as of late with my life and it's craziness, that i feel as though i'm about to crack.  i seriously don't know if i can take it anymore.  i've been incredibly stressed out with my personal life, school, jobs, and future plans.  even though i'm happy to have my friends and family care about me, i've been getting so annoyed when people ask "hey, how's the love life going?"  or "hey, how's work?"  or even better... "hey, do you know about grad school yet?"  i know, i know... i should be thankful people care about me, but just let me vent... i have NO idea what's going on with any of it!  i don't know what's going on in my life because everything is up in the air right now, so i have no answers.  when i talk with friends, i wish we could talk about politics, the weather, what's going on in the world, or just chill out and have a beer together.  i don't want to talk about me.  me makes me crazy right now.  on another note... i've really been missing sweden as of late.  i looked at my pics the other night and i miss that life so badly.  being so young and carefree, nothing to stress or worry about, no bills... just playing with kids all day, drinking beer and going out with my friends at night.  what more could you ask for?

      yesterday was an odd day... i don't even know where to begin, trying to explain it.  though i did have one of the best days teaching yesterday, that didn't really make up for all the other weird things that happened.  though, i was happy to have a good teaching day.  i'm a substitute teacher, and i always feel so inadequate.  i never truly feel like i've grasped the whole teaching bit, but yesterday i did well.  yay.    so many odd conversations yesterday, and they all revolve around men that i've dated, loved, or having feelings for.  interesting.  i emailed all day with *george, a guy that i crushed on for about 5 years.  he's now married and very happy with life.  i like that *george and i can go months without ever talking, or even thinking of eachother, then when we do talk it's like no time has passed and we can connect on a really close level again.  i like that.  i also thought things with *darryl might be going somewhere, but they're not.  i'm not 100% sure how i feel about that yet, i suppose it's hard to tell because i haven't really "lost" him.  i'm no where near ready for a relationship, as i'm still getting over my love with *seth.  though, i had feelings for *darryl and clearly the same feelings weren't reciprocated.  i suppose that's good anyway.  i don't even know.  i have an amazing friendship with *darryl, something i don't want to lose, but when emotions are involved and then shot down, it's difficult.    i've decided not to tell anyone i know about this blog.  therefore i doubt ANYone reads this.  i suppose its my own little ranting and raving place.  i don't want people i know reading this right now, the things i've written are too personal.  and honestly, i don't want to be judged.  and as much as i truly love  my friends, i know they all have their opinions of my life and i'd rather just not hear them right now.  i know i'll wind up getting hurt.. again... but such is life.  god i sound depressing.. i'm gonna go grab breakfast.

      righto... so i'm not really sure what this is all about, but i'm going to give it a whirl.  i feel like it's weird to start one of these things... i'm not sure if i should introduce myself or just start talking about what happened today.  the thing is, i don't think any "new" people will read this, meaning... people that don't know me.  so i think i've decided to just write about what's on my mind today, right now.    i subbed today at leary elementary school, which was pretty fun.  the class i taught yesterday was horrid, i mean, the absolute worst class i've ever been in for!  so today i was greeted with 19 "i'm sorry" notes from each student.  the teacher felt bad that her students were so terrible for me yesterday, so they spent part of their day today writing me letters.  in a way i still think they're little jerks, but it's also really cute.  i'm feeling really stressed out as of late... about everything.  about money, jobs, school, relationships, friendships, this summer, my future, etc.  i'm in such a weird state of life right now... definitely still figuring things out.  i always thought my life would be so planned out, as boring as that sounds.  when i was in high school i imagined that i would be married and in a career by now.  isn't that crazy?  i'm SO young... i'm about to turn 23 in a few weeks.  actually though, i'm really glad i'm not married and in a career right now, it wouldn't feel right.  i still can't decide whether to get the blue or red slurpee, how can i possibly be ready to  make decisions about marriage and career?  so anyway... as much as i bitch about my current state of life, i'm also really happy with it.  i like being so unbelievably free.  if i want to skip town for a few days, i can.  if i want to go out to the bars and have a beer on a monday night, i can.  if i want a hug and to be with someone who cares about me, i have people.  i have so many wonderful people in my life, i don't thank them enough!    hmmmm... that all seems kind of random i suppose.  but it's on my mind.  just my life, what i'm doing, and if i'm happy.  the concluding decision is that i am happy; even though i complain and am really stressed out right now.  things are going okay.  okay, ciao.

      :)  life is going well, folks!  my date with doug last night was   fabulous, he's such a cool guy and we have so much to talk about!  we went to this restaurant on park ave called sinbads, a place i've been eyeing for a while now, so i was glad to finally go.  we ordered 3 meals between the 2 of us- haha, my kinda man!  after dinner we went nextdoor to a bar and talked for hours over some brews.  some of his friends were at the bar and kept buying us rounds of beers... we'd finish one beer and another one magically appeared.  i love when that happens!  :)  the date was   wonderful, one of the best dates i've had in a very, very long time!!!

      well, i just came from my interview at DePaul... i was offered the position as a mental health counselor!  though, i'm not sure i'll take it.  ya know, the whole commitment issue.  and the money... wow... if i take this job, it definitely WON'T be for the money!  i'll keep ya'll posted.  so i'm going on my date with doug in a little while, i must say... i like that he's planning it.  when he asked me out last night we didn't have that "where do you want to go?"  "what do you want to do?" conversation that sometimes annoys me... he just said "hmm... i guess i wasn't prepared with anything cool to do, so give me tomorrow to plan, okay?  i'll call you at 7 and we'll go out!"  :)  i liked that.  i like that he's putting effort into our date.  effort- something that i don't often find in men.    i spoke with ben a few nights ago... he called at midnight and asked if i wanted to come over.  you all may not think this is a very big deal, but i told him NO!  that was a huge step for me... i have a definite weakness for ben!!!  we're still friends, and that i like... but calling me over at midnight was "friends" not friends.  and lastly... i spoke with andre'a today.  he's doing well in italy.  when he returns home, he asked if i would accompany him in a nice italian dinner with fresh mozerella cheese, and homemade pasta and wine- brought back from italy!  HOW CAN I TURN THAT DOWN?!

      i have a date tomorrow!!!  his name is doug and i met him last wednesday night at woody's.  he seemed like a really cool guy, i think i blogged about him a bit last week, so i was excited when he called tonight.  we're going out tomorrow after my interview with DePaul, a mental health organization where i'm applying to be a counselor.  wish me luck!!!  so listen to this... i've been doing laundry much of my day today, when i go out to switch loads and realize a load of my laundry is MISSING!  now, i live in an apartment complex- there are 5 apartments in my secure section to this one washer and drier.  i've moved people's clothes before if they were sitting in there for a while with no one coming to continue.  but i was in and out every 20 minutes or so!!!  the really weird thing is, they took the load that was in the washer!  not the clothes that were in the drier (they were towels, i suppose that's not something you'd really want to take) and didn't touch the piles of dirty laundry i had in a basket, just the clean, WET clothes that were in the washer!  i can't figure this out!!!  so someone out there has a load of my wet laundry... what freaks!!!!!  i'm still trying to figure out what clothes i'm missing and i'm NOT happy to be without them!  if i see anyone wearing my clothes- the gloves are off!!!

      this is  my own little personal space to fill with my opinions, thoughts, and whatever... so i'm going to take this opportunity to invite all of you to watch FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  i watched it yesterday evening, and it was one of the most powerful films i've ever seen!  michael moore has many critics, though i am one of his supporters- i give him credit for being so bold, and for making people realize how silly they are acting in very matter-of-fact way.  the movie takes you on a roller coaster of emotions... one minute i was sobbing and the next i was pointing and laughing at bush on the screen.  i think it's a great film, and i think it can be used as just one tool for people to use when thinking about their vote this november.  thanks.

      so- i met a very nice guy tonight at mex.  he's italian... like, used-to-smash-grapes-with-his-feet-when-he-was-a-kid, italian.  it was sooooo wonderful to hear his stories from italy- his family not only makes their own pasta sauce, but their own pasta, olive oil, wine, etc.  hearing about his culture was so fascinating for me, his hometown sounds so beautiful.  when i visited italy in 2002 i went to the major cities, but would have loved to travel to the small villages and communities.  he's leaving on sunday to go home for a week- oh how i wish i was going to italy on sunday..... sigh.    i feel as though i'm itching to travel again.  i crave people that enjoy my passion for traveling and seeing what the world has to offer.  there is so much beauty out there, yes even in rochester, and more people need to get out and enjoy it!  andre'a and i were talking about jobs and work and he said "i work to travel."  and i had to think about it for a second to really get it... but wow, was it powerful to me.  i mean, as my last entry mentions i'm looking for a lot out of my intended career, but the idea of working just to have enough money to support travels is exciting to me.    on an unrelated note... patrick and i hung out today and got pedicures!  oh how i've missed my patrick.  :)

      dear friends- whenever i am upset, depressed, sad, mad, angry, etc. please just tell me to go to the gym!  it makes the world of difference with my mood.  i can remember when i was dating alan, and we'd have one of our (many) fights, he'd say "kimmy... have you gone to the gym today?"  (sounds like, "have you taken your medication today?"  haha)  i used to get so annoyed when he'd say that.  but it's true.  working out is my release, i gather up all these negative feelings and it affects my mood.  when i was in spinning class today, i felt like a superhero!  i worked my butt off, and it felt soooooo amazing!!!  i don't even know where all the energy came from, but there it was.  hooray for spinning!  i sent out resumes and cover letters for some jobs today... i'm actually feeling pretty hopeful about it!  the jobs i applied for sound super cool- and definitely something which will inspire me.  i'm super picky about jobs, i've realized.  it's quite a commitment and i want to make sure i know what i'm getting myself into.  i'm looking for something that will be inspiring, a job that will be motivational, a job i won't "get" too quickly, a job where i actually want to wake up in the morning and go to, as well as a job where i can help people.  lets just hope i find this amazing position!  :)  ciao.

      being home for father's day yesterday wasn't overly filled with drama- surprise!!!!!!  we went out to dinner to this really nice italian restaurant... food was GREAT!  yumm yumm.  it was nice to spend the day with my parents, usually these events are filled with fights, drama, and negative comments, but today's wasn't much of any of these things.  it was generally, nice!  phew...  though, when i got back to my apartment i had to deal with the ben drama.  we talked on IM, which i suppose made it a bit easier for us to say what we needed to say.  we're going back to being friends, and leaving the "friends" behind for a while (or forever?).  i suppose i saw this coming, dating doesn't last forever, and i really didn't see it turning into anything serious.  i am sad about it though, i'll admit that.  when ben and i were good, we were AMAZING!  we have this rare friendship that is something i don't want to lose... who knows how this will all play out.  he said yesterday that i'm still really important to him, and for the most part, i believe him.  i guess we'll see what happens.  deep down, i understand this is probably a good decision.  i'm still getting over alan... which will be a lengthy process.  as margaret said to me today... "there are times in life where you need to go through it alone, i think this is your time."  margaret- i agree.  it won't be easy, but i'm realizing the truth and importance in that.

      well, ben and i are experiencing our first fight- that's for damn sure!  i probably shouldn't have gone over there anyway, because i was feeling sad about alan... but being that ben is one of my closest friends, i figured it would be nice not to be alone last night.  wrong!  last night was fine... actually it was really nice, we talked and laughed and my mood was lifted in no time.  but this morning ben was in rare form, just horribly moody!  i am   so   nice to him... you don't even understand.  i am a nice person, who enjoys treating my friends well.  but when you cross the line and treat me like dirt, watch out...   i'm realizing that most of you don't even know who ben is... and to be honest i know who he is, but not what he is.  ben is my "friend" and we've been dating for a few months.  nothing at all serious or exclusive.  weird- yeah, for me!  i know how to be a friend, and i know how to be a girlfriend, this in between shit confuses the hell out of me.  i go back and forth with my thoughts on dating... lately i've felt really comfortable with what ben and i have.  it's not serious, there's no love... but we like each other enough to not want this to end.  i like the freedom and the space.  and before any of these added bonus' came about, ben and i are   really   good friends, something neither of us want to lose.  but then WHY is he acting like such a moron lately!???  i was so upset this morning that i walked out of his apartment while he was saying some shit "tell your father happy father's day..."    *note to men* when you are being a dick and you've had major attitude all morning with a woman, right when she's fed up and about to leave, don't try and save yourself and say something lame, while completely ignoring your behavior!    (where are all the nice men?)

      feeling: there is nowhere i'd rather be right now than in alan's arms...   reason:  i think i'm just feeling sad right now because i waitressed a wedding reception tonight... enough said.          i'm also feeling weird because i'm supposed to be in china with alan and his parents right now, but i'm not.          and lastly, i'm getting anxious about the wedding alan and i are going to in july together.  i haven't seen him since we broke up and i'm imagining it's going to be really difficult.  i miss him like crazy, and i can't wait to see him, but i also know that it'll be quite emotional.

      hi.  i'm super hungover right now... my poor liver.  i've been so unbelievably horrible to it this past month, i hope it can forgive me, someday.  so last night was the east end festival here in roch-cha-cha... it was pretty fun.  i was drinking with my girls early on, so i was pretty drunk by the time we met up with ben at 10pm, which, i felt annoyed him.  oh well.  the festival was crazy... they blocked off east ave, and it was just PACKED with people, bands, alcohol, and religious freaks with signs telling me they were going to save me.  i feel i am spiritual, but not religious.  i'm not a huge fan of organized religion, and definitely not a fan of so many rules and restrictions that religion often places upon people.  so in my drunken stooper, i decided i wanted to talk to these people.  i was respectful for the majority of the conversation, i'm not a rude person and i can agree to disagree with someone when we're just not going to see eye to eye... but i couldn't handle it anymore when he started talking shit about gay marriage, interracial marriage, abortions- i FLIPPED!  seriously... it must take so much effort to be so closed minded, to hate so many people and to be against so much.  can't people just open their minds, love and respect the differences in others, and accept?  i realize i'm probably sounding really naive, but seriously... i get so frustrated with people.  i hate that i let that guy upset me so much, but he did.  i got so emotionally involved in that conversation with him....

      i went home today.  my grandpa has been really sick lately... and i'm not dealing very well with it.  my other grandpa passed away when i was in sweden for a semester, and i wasn't able to return home.  i think that experience has scared me for life, so whenever my other grandpa goes into the hospital i go RUNNING home to visit him.  i want to be with him, with my family, ya know?  though, on a lighter note... a few weeks ago when he was in the hospital, they released him when i was there visiting him!  so i got to transport him back to grandma's house... she was so surprised!!!  and today when i drove home to visit- the same thing!  i was shocked though, he just had surgery on tuesday, but aparently the doc's thought he was ready to return home.  it's just so hard seeing him so skinny, so weak looking... it's not the grandpa i remember.    also... matt's tombstone has arrived.  matt was my cousin- we were the same age, and he lived nearby so we saw each other at family functions, school, and everywhere else.  when we were sophomores in college, he was killed in a car accident.  its been a few years, and i've gone through a range of emotions and healing- though i don't think i'll ever fully understand or deal.  so when i was home today, my grandma mentioned that i should visit matt because his tombstone has arrived and she was telling me how beautiful it was.  and it is... it's gorgeous.  but it feels weird to use a word like "gorgeous" when describing one of the most horrifying objects in my life.  god... the writing on it, it  makes it so real.  his name printed out in stone, his d.o.b.- only a few short months before mine.  it gave me the chills... i stood outside in the rain, by myself, "talking" with him.  i can't even put into words how it made me feel...   (elaine, are you visiting?  i could  really  use a girl friend right now...)

      well now... i've had a crazy, yet incredible past few days in atlantic city!  ya know those friends you have, but unfortunately do not keep in touch with as often as you'd like to?  that's how it is with megan (the bride) and i, we don't call each other nearly as often as we should, yet when we're together it's like time has never passed.  her bachelorette party was simply amazing.  there were 5 of us crammed into villy's audi (with no ac) driving down to atlantic city, but we made the best of it.  gotta love girly road trips!!!  we partied like superstars at night in the clubs, and gave megan the rest and relaxation she needed during the day at the beach and spa.    aparently in atlantic city there are no male strip clubs, is that weird to any one else?  so we had to take her to see nekked ladies... i had asked one of the security guards in trump tower which nudy bar he suggested for us, and he mentioned that "if 6 lovely ladies like yourselves walk into the naked strip club, you'll get harassed by guys, so go into the clubs where the girls have g-strings on and you'll be safe."  it was actually a lot of fun.  both nights we were out until the sun came up... i don't know how we made it, but i suppose lots of alochol and dancing can keep anyone in party mode.  during the day we layed out on the beach and walked around the boardwalk.  we even tried out for wheel of fortune... they had a contestant search that weekend in atlantic city, and though none of us made it, we still had fun!!!  we all met some very interesting male species... the guys that asked for my phone number (yes, believe it or not, there were actually quite a few!) i gave them pitt's (the groom) number.  he's gotten quite a few phone calls already asking for me.  muhahahahaha!  when i was sitting down with ben last night telling him my stories from the weekend, i realized that for the past several days i have been completely in the "here and now."  a term often used in my grad classes, but also a term that i have a very difficult time understanding.  i find myself constantly thinking and preparing the future, and rarely enjoying the  moment.  my days are run by money and time... and i feel as though i need to be overly practical with both.  but this weekend, was different.  i couldn't really afford that trip, and when i should have driven right back to rochester on sunday night, i decided to stay the night in binghamton and catch up with pitt and lat.  monday morning i went out to breakfast with megan, pitt, and lat... then we went back to their house and looked at pictures and videos from parties at college.  good times.  it was great to hang out with them again and reconnect!!!  then on my drive back to rochester, when i was traveling through syracuse, i decided to try my luck and see if gigi was around.  so i stopped by gigi's work and hung out with her for about an hour!  i took my time getting home and spent time with friends, because that seemed to be more important.  even though i have a million things that need to be done... it didn't seem overly important yesterday.  pictures will (hopefully) be posted soon...

      well... today sure has some interesting twists!  i met my good friend, megan for lunch today at pho 99... the best restaurant in buffalo!  mmmmmm!  after stuffing our faces, we caught up on all our girly talk.  i'm a bridesmaid in megan's wedding this august, so we had plenty to discuss.  anyway, she mentioned that her bachelorette party is this weekend and there is still an opening if i wanted to go.  see... initially, i told her i could not go, because of work, money, traveling to china with alan, etc.  i felt terrible for not attending, but it just wasn't gong to work out.  well... as luck would have it... i can go, and it's really not a problem at all.  the god's were with me today, because i have the whole weekend off without even asking for it!  i'm not going to china anymore (unfortunately) and i've got a few extra bucks and off i go... to ATLANTIC CITY!!!  hooray.  i'm super excited and i know we'll have a blast.  boardwalk and beach- here i come!!!  next order of business... STEVEN FISKE CALLED ME!!!  so yesterday i left him a phone message, and i would have bet my life that he wouldn't have the balls to return it, but he did!  come to find out... steven and lola did date for 4 years, but this past december steven found out that lola was cheating on him and they broke up.  because they've been through so much together, they continued to sort of date on and off... as it was difficult for both of them to stop all communication.  so they still see each other every few weeks, but are not together.  according to steven, she's having a hard time getting over him and she can't handle him seeing anyone else and that they are NOT together!  funny thing is- i believe him.  now, i don't know steven overly well, i'll be the first to admit, but i honestly don't think he'd lie to me.  i think he's telling me the truth about him and lola.  don't worry though... i'm not going to go running up to toronto into his arms, because i didn't get out of a perfectly good long distance relationship to get myself into another one, but i think maybe next time i travel to toronto, i'd call him up and see what he's up to?  i dunno....    life has a funny way of speaking to me...

      dear blog readers... you're going to love this one!  remember that nice fellow, steven that i met this past weekend in niagara falls?  the one that said, "you made me weekend, and just the thought of you makes me smile."  well i have an interesting story to update you about dear mr. steven.  i get an email (yes, i check my email while i'm subbing) from a girl named lola and the subject is "regarding steven fiske."  i open it up and it reads: Who are you, and why are you emailing my boyfriend?  well, OH MY GOD!  i'm going to ignore that this chick is reading up on her boyfriends email, because this scum bag deserves her snooping!!!!!!  so miss lola and i have become quite close today, emailing back and forth telling each other every bit of detail we need to know.  i told her everything... i told her that her boyfriend kissed me this weekend and swept me off my drunk feet!  i told her that he's been emailing me everyday since asking me to come visit him in toronto and how amazing of a girl he thinks i am, blah blah blah!  she deserves to know the truth.  i've been that girl who's been cheated on, and i would have appreciated the other girl to be as honest with me.  so honesty is what lola got, and appreciated.  it's too bad though... they've been dating for 4 years!  so, men out there... DON'T CHEAT!  my god, don't get your dumbass selves into relationships that you can't handle being faithful in.  if you cannot handle keeping your penis and lips off of another woman, then break up with her!  don't be a fucking loser and cheat!    STEVEN FISKE... you are filth!

      "I've seen you stay with losers that don't deserve to clean your toilet... and seen guys that seem so wonderful go to shit... and through it all I never doubted how amazing you are.  And that I know... eventually... some guy will get his head out of his ass and not take you for granted, but only take you as wonderful.  Until that day... you'll stay so close to perfect... and I'll stay here and be there for you every time... through them all... and always there to hear anything that happens... "  all i have to say is, wow.  thank you for that.  though, i think you are a bit harsh on my past boyfriends... it means a lot to know that i have friends that will always be there for me and believe in me.

      "you made my weekend, and just the thought of you makes me smile."  someone said that to me... do you believe that no one has ever said that to me before?  regardless if anyone has ever felt that, no one has ever put it into words and said that to me.  it felt so nice... so sweet and genuine.  :)  yay.  on an unrelated note... i'm sick!  i've gotten sick so much this year, i think it's from subbing and being around dirty kids all the time.  not that i completely mind, becuse i love the kids, but i could really do without being sick all the time.  booo...

      well now... my birthday weekend is officially over, and it was an amazing one!  i'm going to have to say that it was one of the best birthdays, ever... and that's tough to beat.  i wasn't overly excited about going to canada, because i was still bumming about the cancelation of the whole limo party, and the lack of everyone going.  it ended up being only me, tammy, amy, and amy's boyfriend- john.  but let me tell you, i had a  great  time!!!  we met these guys from toronto that were down for a bachelor party, great group of fella's!  i met one in particular that caught my eye, steven, he was very very nice.  i'd like to meet up with him again if/when i visit toronto next.  we shall see...  the drive home from canada was tough... i was exhausted (as i got no more than maybe, 4 hours of sleep saturday night) and tammy was vomiting much of the drive back to roch-cha-cha.  poor girl.  i felt so sorry for her, being that hungover is not fun.  so i pulled into my apartment thinking i'd hop into bed, snuggle with my teddy and take a nap all afternoon... but, instead i went to a greek festival with ben.  i suppose i'm easy to convince, as my favorite phrase as of late is, "sleep is for retirement!"  so off i went... the festival was fun- we ate greek food and beer.  yum!  then we went to abbotts for some ice cream, no pistachio pineapple but i was still a happy camper.  we sat outside on park avenue, people watching for about an hour, was nice.    i'm really contemplating moving to san francisco.  it's something i've always wantend to do, and i don't want to be one of those people that talk the talk, but there is never any action to all that talking.  after living there last summer, i was convinced that SF is where i belong.  the people are so different... they're open minded, they're friendly, they're outgoing, they're into having fun, and diverse!!!  what more can i ask for?  it helps to have my brother and his girlfriend living there, so i know all of their friends, plus the friends i made when i was there last summer.  if things don't work out with brockport, i'm gone.  and if things do work out with brockport, as soon as i have my master's degree... i still want to move.  this is what ben and i talked about while at abbott's yesterday... california dreamin'     :)

      what up folks?  so my birthday was yesterday... it was such a great day!  thanks for all of those who made it an extra special day for me!!!  i had a hot dinner date with tammy at lola's, such a great restaurant.  one of the best meals i've ever eaten, they have the best chicken french!  mmmmm.... the last time i'd eaten there was the last time alan visited, for our year and a half anniversary.  right.  anyway, after our yummy dinner we picked up ben and went to a carnival for a little bit.  i wanted to visit jason and melissa, they were working the "big jumping cage thingie", so that was boat loads of fun.  while meliss, tammy, and i jumped our hearts out, ben was inside playing poker... and won $50!  yay- go ben!  after the carnival tammy, ben, and i went to the geva theater for an improv comedy show, which was very very funny.  afterwards ben and i went to the alexander street pub for some dancin'.  why o' why do black men find me so attractive?  i don't consider myself a "hot girl" but aparently black men think i am.... maybe it's my ghetto booty?  who knows.   so, tammy's on her way over here now... we're off to canada for the night to continue the birthday celebrations!!!  yipeeee....

      i'm typing this between tears... i'm such a sap.  birthday's mean so much to me and you've all made it so incredibly wonderful.  things have been going so shitty as of late in my life, and i sort of lost hope for my birthday being a big deal... or even that people would remember it.  i was wrong.  i had a wonderful dinner with my parent's last night- i had my first shot with my parents!  sort of weird looking out of the corner of my eyes seeing drew and linda kick one back, but also pretty cool.  i've gotten so many sweet cards from friends, emails from friends in germany, holland, sweden, and japan... geez- i feel SO lucky to have all these amazing friends!!!  and i was greeted at my apartment door with a beautiful bouquet of flowers from alan... and a card that made me sob.  you all mean so very much to me... thank you for today!!!  :)

      okay, even though life sucks right now... i did find a reason to smile last night.  i went over to ben's last night around 9pm and we decided to go for a walk.  i hadn't eaten dinner yet, so we decided to stop at this place on park ave. that we'd both heard so much about.  it's an asian restaurant that a girl whom also applied to my grad program works at, actually, her parent's own it.  so i heard about it from her during her interview, and ben had heard about it because one of the guys on his softball league goes there a lot, aparently it's really good.  well, wouldn't you know margarie (girl in my classes) and the softball guy (eek, forgot his name!) were both there!!!  it was so great.  so i talked with margarie and she kept saying how wonderful she thought i did atthe interview, and how after i went, she felt so intimidated because i did so amazingly well.  blah, blah, blah.  she was shocked when she found out i only got conditionally accecpted; she was accepted.  i'm really proud of her, she did well... but it's hard hearing from SO many people that they thought i did really well, when i only got conditional.  UGH!    anyway, i ordered udon.  mmmm... one of my favorite dishes.  and they had BUBBLE TEA!  oh my gosh, i looked so hard for bubble tea in rochester (obviously not hard enough!) and i just didn't think there were quality asian places around.  i was definitely wrong!  i was looking for something homemade and small... not a big chain restaurant.  something that would taste similar to alan's mom's food.  something that felt comfortable and warm and inviting.  this place did!  it made me miss alan a lot... seeing margarie's mom... hearing her talk.  i got thinking about the china trip i was supposed to go on with him and his family this summer... i SO wanted to go.  i love alan's family so much... it's difficult when you date someone for so long, you don't just break up with them, you break up with their family too.  "break up" is such a horrible term... sounds so cold and lost.  which isn't alan and i at all... this has been the most healthy break up i've ever been involved with.  anyway, i'm getting too deep into that... i was happy to have bubble tea and udon!!!!!!

      well now... as i wrote yesterday, things are not going well.  at all!  things are going amazingly horrible right now, and they only got worse last night and this morning.  i felt like a stranger with one of my good friends last night, that made me feel really sad.  i felt as though i didn't belong and i was no longer welcome.  which isn't the case, i do believe i am welcome... but i can't erase my odd feelings.  i didn't sleep, i coudln't.  i kept having weird dreams and weird happenings.... i wish i could give you more detail, but it wouldn't be right.  also... my one glimmer of hope, my lovely birthday party.  is now canceled.  the limo bus filled with 16 of my friends, partying the night away is now canceled.  right.  why would i assume i could at least have a happy birthday?  why would i assume such a thing?  life BLOWS!

      wow- am i cranky right now!  i'm not even exaggerating when i say that things are definitely not going my way right now.  in order for something to be taking place in my life right now, it must be both fucked up and complicated.  part of me wants to apologize for my entries always sounding so pissed off and negative... but then i think apologizing for that would be stupid.  this is one of the few spots i am able to rant, everyone see's me as this happy, friendly, cheerful girl... heck, i'm getting my master's degree in counseling, so people assume, "her life is so great, that's why she's the counselor, because she's got shit figured out!"  WRONG!  i have problems too, i have bad days, days that make me want to cry myself to sleep, days that make me wonder why i even bother... i'm human too, ya know?  so i'm feeling really sensitive as of late... i can take a joke, i can.  i know i dish it out enough, i should be able to take 'em back.  but, the thing is... i get made fun of a LOT wheni i'm home.  my friends, and especially my family- i am the butt to all the jokes.  i kid you not!  i can only take enough jokes, ya know?  why me?  why do they feel they can make fun of me, are they perfect?  does it make them feel better about themself to make fun of me?  i just wish the jokes could decrease, even just a little would be nice.    my 23rd birthday is on friday.  i don't have any plans (on my actual birthday).  i'm having a really cool part/bar thing on saturday night, which i'm REALLY looking forward to, but nothing for friday.  i realize it's my birthday, i should probably make a plan or something... but i sort of wished someone would suggest something, or offer to take me out.  i know that probably sounds really selfish... i don't mean for it to.  i think i'm famous for wishing people could read my mind.  i don't know why i do it...   btw... donz thanks for the comment!  i didn't think anyone read this thing.  thanks!  :)  i'm out.

      within one hour yesterday i noticed 3 things that were  really  sweet and made me smile to myself... (1) i let spencer go. drove to the erie canal (his original home) and plopped him back in... he was soooo happy to be back. he kept bobbing his head up and down and swam like such a little champ. i swear he was across the canal in about a minute. i think spencer forgot he was a turtle and is supposed to be slow, 'cause he is quite the swimmer. spencer- i miss you, buddy. (2) i was in wegman's strolling past the flower section when i saw an older man picking out a beautiful bouquet of red roses. he was smiling from ear to ear, it was contagious. i found myself grinning just looking at his happiness. i walked right to the card section of wegman's (i love card shopping) and soon found mr. flowers. he, again, was smiling from ear to ear picking out a card. i'm assuming the card and roses were for the same person and it made my heart melt. he seemed so happy and excited about the gifts... there  are  sweet men out there! (3) i was driving back to my apartment, stopped at a redlight. i glanced in my rear view mirror and saw 2 love birds in the car behind me. the girl was driving, and the guy was the passenger. he put his head on her shoulder and appeared to be singing... while she was smiling and leaning her head against his. they looked really happy.

      good day, ya'll.&nbsp; so day 3 of work has come and gone and it's been going GREAT!&nbsp; i actually feel bad for having so many preconceived notions about DePaul, because the house i'm working at now is completely different than my other one.&nbsp; the counselors i'm working with at this house are all in their 20's and they're SO fun, easy going, sweet, and caring!&nbsp; its such a great work environment for me... i'm really happy there.&nbsp; and the residents are beginning to warm up to me, they're all mentally ill and don't deal overly well with change.&nbsp; i've spoken with a few of them 1 on 1 and i think i'm really getting somewhere with them... the wall behind my desk is already half filled with pictures they've made for me.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; yay!&nbsp; i just came from a depaul luau this evening.. all of the houses&nbsp;in rochester met at the administration building for a luau and it was&nbsp;a blast.&nbsp; i did the chicken dance and electric&nbsp;slide with a bunch of the clients- too cute!&nbsp; in september i'm attending camping trip with my house and several others, i'm really looking forward to it.&nbsp; it will be great for the residents to go camping, and also a great bonding experience for me and all the other counselors... so yeah, job is going VERY well!&nbsp;   things with ben have been going really well... he's definitely&nbsp;my best friend here in rochester.&nbsp; there are few people that i can completely be myself around, and ben is one of them.&nbsp; i can say anything to him and he'll listen.&nbsp; we can go from acting like brother and sister and teasing each other to having a really serious talk about love and life- a&nbsp;versatile friend, if you will.&nbsp; oh- i've also been playing a lot of pool!&nbsp; and i LOVE it.&nbsp; ben&nbsp;is  very &nbsp;good, and he's been teaching me his skillz... i was at a bar last night playing doubles with doug and i made some amazing shots!!!&nbsp; i wish ben was there to see it, he would have been really proud.&nbsp; and speaking of pool- i'm off in a few to go shoot some with ben and chad.&nbsp;   ciao ciao...

      so- this morning ends my wonderful summer vacation, i begin work today.&nbsp; though i am very excited to get back into counseling and working with people, i'm  really  going to miss all of my free time.&nbsp; my last week&nbsp;of time off was amazing... i really packed all that i could into it.&nbsp;   wednesday night ben and i went to a happy hour for the kickball team he played on (the game was this past saturday).&nbsp; everyone from the team showed up, which was really nice, so that everyone could meet and mingle before the big day on saturday.&nbsp; they made team t-shirts and were able to put&nbsp; names on the back... ben chose "MR. RIGHT.&nbsp; (single and ready to mingle)"&nbsp; which i thought was very funny.&nbsp; this other guy chad whom we quickly bonded with decided to change his name from whatever it was to, "MR. WRONG.&nbsp;(scary, hairy, and ready to marry)"&nbsp; it was hilarious!!!!&nbsp; so ben and i hung out with our new friends stef and chad all night and had a blast, though we were all disappointed that i wouldn't be at the festival on saturday to watch them play, because i couldn't afford to go.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; it was $30 just to get in the door (but you ate and drank for free all day!)... and seeing as though i had to work at 6pm, i didn't think i should spend the money i don't really have on that.&nbsp; so saturday morning i was ben's ride to the festival, since he'd be drinking all day i said i'd drive him there and pick him up so that he wouldn't have to worry about calling a taxi or whatever.&nbsp; but when we woke up he sort of pouted and said "i really want you to be there today, it won't be the same if you're not."&nbsp; he offered to pay for half my ticket, which initially i felt really weird about, but he insisted!&nbsp; so- yay, i went to the 10 ugly men festival.&nbsp; weird name i know, but damn it was fun!!!&nbsp; the kickball tournament was a blast, their team did really well... even though the last several games, they were all drunk!&nbsp; there were people everywhere, bands playing, and lots of great free beer and food.&nbsp; i have this super hot professor that's in a band, and they happened to be playing at the festival saturday... yay!&nbsp; it was cool to see "dr. hernandez" all jammin' out with his band... soooo hot!&nbsp; :)&nbsp;   great times, great friends, great party........... i'm off to work.

      hello folks... can i just say that i  love  rochester!&nbsp; when i first moved to rochester i didn't really get out much, i had a serious boyfriend, i had 3 jobs, and grad school and i had no great desire to go out and discover my town.&nbsp; lame i know, but it was the damn truth.&nbsp; i actually used to call it "crap-chester."&nbsp;   i am a changed woman though, i have been out and about discovering all that rochester has to offer lately and i'm quite impressed, delighted, and happy with my surrounding area.&nbsp; i was shopping at  urlLink http://http://www.parkleigh.com &nbsp;(parkleigh) this afternoon- enjoying their summer sale and all the fun things they sell.&nbsp; i could spend hours in that store... and i finished it off with a godiva raspberry truffle.&nbsp; Mmmmmm!&nbsp; on my walk back to the car, i passed a house with a sign out front, "the dutch market."&nbsp; this was very appealing, because i have been to germany, and several scandinavian countries and i truly miss the food, smells, people, and chocolate!&nbsp; i stepped in and it felt like i was back in a small pastry shop in sweden... i bought some chocolate (and ate that, right after i finished my truffle) and picked up a menu.&nbsp; i want to go back someday for afternoon tea or a pannekoeken... anyone interested in dining with me?   when i returned home, i ate an extra large salad... felt i had to after all that chocolate!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; so tonight is the 2nd east end festival, i hope it goes well.&nbsp; i remember the one last month was less than pleasing for me, i went with ben and we ended up running into a group of girls that oogle over him.&nbsp; they gave me mean looks and were rude to me, and i remember in my drunken stooper trying to run away from ben and take a taxi home.&nbsp; basically, i was being a stupid drunk girl, and ben was being stupid horny boy.... we're not a good combination when we're like that.&nbsp; this evening i'm attending the east end festival with ben and tony (his best friend from high school that's back in town- yay!).&nbsp; i think it will be fun, because the 3 of us are a lot of fun together... but i have those stupid memories from last month that won't go away.&nbsp;   in closing i will say this... rochester, i heart you!

      i so rarely remember my dreams, but i must share with you my dream that i actually remember from last night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i suppose eating pita pitt right before going to bed wasn't the smartest idea, because it gave me some  crazy  dreams, YO!&nbsp;   i was sitting at a friend's house (not sure who's) on their couch... it was me and 2 friends.&nbsp; we were talking, being girls, and just hanging around when we heard this really loud noise!&nbsp; i looked out the big bay window that was opposite the couch i was sitting on and i saw fire and&nbsp;stuff flying&nbsp;everywhere.&nbsp; it was a BOMB!&nbsp;&nbsp;it eventually came through and broke the living room window.&nbsp; my friends and i were covering our heads, just trying to stay alive.&nbsp; the room caught on fire and we had to find our way to the door so that we could find safety.&nbsp; i don't really know what else happens after this.... but isn't that CRAZY!?&nbsp;   i looked up in an online dream dictionary what dreaming of bombs means and here is what it tells me:  Dreaming of a bomb means that you may be going through a potentially explosive and trying situation in your waking life. The bomb could represent repressed desires and unexpressed emotions that are likely to explode or burst if not dealt with soon. It could be something within yourself, such as the desire to explode with anger over an issue that's affecting you.  &nbsp;  ummm... whoa.&nbsp; i don't even know what to say about that.....................

      yesterday was the best day i've had in a very looong time!&nbsp; i crave being spontaneous and the past 24 hours have been just that!&nbsp; i left around 10pm on monday night and drove to ithaca to say goodbye to one of my bestest friends, diana.&nbsp; she and her boyfriend are driving across country and moving to california... diana already has an apartment in hollywood!!!&nbsp; wow.&nbsp; so i definitely needed to meet up with them in ithaca and wish my girl luck and have one last crazy night with&nbsp;Di before she migrates west.&nbsp; my time in ithaca was  aaaaaaaaaaaamazing!&nbsp;  it included numerous shots and beers with friends, sleeping at alpha delta phi one last time, lunch at viva taqueria with margaret, shopping in the commons,&nbsp;wearing my "ithaca is gorges" t-shirt while climbing one of the gorges (so cheesy, yet so fun), jumping into the gorges in my bra and underwear, dinner and pie a la mode at dories, a beautiful walk around wells campus, watching the sunset at the aurora inn, and jamming to  rusted root  and  cake  on the drive back to rochester.&nbsp;   doug accompanied me on my trip to ithaca.&nbsp; we had talked a few weeks ago about going to ithaca at some point this summer, so when i decided to go i called him up and invited him to go with me.&nbsp; yes, doug is the guy that left me in the ER last week, but... we've talked about it and i think i understand his logic and thinking of that night.&nbsp; he feels terrible and wasn't really thinking clearly (obviously)... i haven't forgotten, but i've forgiven.&nbsp; anyway, it was really nice to spend the day with him in ithaca... he's really adventurous, and always up for having a good time.   today i'm going to lay out by the pool and enjoy the evening hanging out with ben... i'm going to enjoy this last week of unemployment as best i can!!!   &nbsp;

      ben is back in my life.&nbsp; this makes me really happy- i missed him when we weren't talking/seeing each other.&nbsp; it's interesting... you learn so much about a person in a state of urgency that you were completely unaware of when life is "normal."&nbsp; ben has a heart of gold, but unfortunately for him, so few people are able to see that.&nbsp; anyway, i just wanted to mention that i'm glad ben is back.  &nbsp; yesterday on&nbsp;my drive back from 6 flags melissa, ben and i stopped for some ice cream.&nbsp; i was really craving ice cream, so it was&nbsp;mostly my idea... i asked the man behind the counter if a certain ice cream had nuts in it (i am deathy allergic to most nuts).&nbsp; his response, "no, i don't think so."&nbsp; i said... "well, can you please check, because i'm allergic?"&nbsp; and he said... "i'm sure... there are no nuts in that one, it's just vanilla ice cream, raspberry swirls, and chunks of chocolate."&nbsp; so i ordered myself a cone of that and went along my merry way... 3 licks into the ice cream cone i realize that the chocolate chunks are crunchy, becuase they have NUTS IN THEM!&nbsp; my goodness people- this is sooooo not something to take lightly!!!&nbsp; people must think allergies mean- sneezing, coughing, or scratching?!&nbsp; when i say i'm deathy allergic to nuts, they must think i'm kidding?&nbsp; ben wanted to go back to the ice cream shop and smash it in that man's face, but we didn't.&nbsp; oddly enough, i get embarassed when this happens... it happens frequent enough, but i rarely make an issue of it. &nbsp; i'm off to the chiropractor... yay!

      i was lucky yesterday, folks!&nbsp; doug and i were driving back from my friend tammy's house when we got into a car accident...&nbsp;i was rear ended by a big dodge ram!&nbsp; "oh my god!&nbsp; i'm so sorry, my foot slipped off the breaks!&nbsp; oh my god!"&nbsp; my little saturn was at a complete stop at a redlight when his huge truck slammed into the back of me, and i went forward and hit the car in front of me!&nbsp; we sure got bumped around.&nbsp; so, most importantly... everyone is alive and okay.&nbsp; and actually, the only car damage that was done was to his big honkin' truck!&nbsp; which i find slightly amusing... so many people buy suv's or huge trucks because they feel safe in them, but in the accident yesterday, the huge vehicle is the one that had the most damage... his whole front bumper was smashed in and my saturn went off without a scratch.&nbsp; HA!&nbsp; because i've been in a car accident prior to this one, and have had neck/back problems since my other accident, i went right to the ER yesterday to get x-rays because i was hurting right away.&nbsp; x-rays came out fine and my only diagnosis is "cervical strain" which is fine- could have been a lot worse- but i am SO sore and uncomfortable!!!&nbsp; it's more my upper back than anything else... it huuuuuuurts!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  i wanted to share a story though about the ER yesterday.&nbsp; so- i  really really really  hate being in hospitals, and especially emergency rooms!&nbsp; this probably isn't common knowledge about myself, but i don't know anyone out there that really&nbsp; loves  the place.&nbsp; so doug came with me to the emergency room, i thought because he was in the accident with me and was immediately complaining about back pain as well that he'd also get checked out.&nbsp; we drove separately to the ER (yes, i drove myself there)... so imagine this... i'm signing in and filling out paperwork when they put a neck brace on me and put me in a wheel chair.&nbsp; it looked a bit dramatic, but my blood pressure was sky high and that's probably standard for neck pain.&nbsp; so i'm sitting there (unhappy and scared, because i  HATE  emergency rooms) with my neck brace in a wheel chair when doug leans in, kisses me and says "alright... i'm gonna get going, my softball game starts in half an hour.&nbsp; i'll call you later to see how you are, okay babe?"&nbsp; i was in such shock that i couldn't even say anything!&nbsp; to be in an emergency room anyway scares the heck out of me, but to be LEFT in one all by myself?!!!!&nbsp; oh my god!&nbsp; i freaked out and demanded that i was wheeled outside so i could use my cell phone to "phone a friend."&nbsp; i called my melissa (my cousin's fience, and my new roommate starting in a few weeks) and she drove over in a flash and saved the day.&nbsp; THANK YOU, MELISSA!!!&nbsp; so i find it humorous that the guy that everyone thought was soooooo sweet and cared about me sooooooo much actually left me there in the ER by myself.&nbsp; i realize i was mostly fine, and i wasn't dying or bleeding, but c'mon.... have a heart!&nbsp;

      wow... it has been a while since i've blogged.  if anyone still reads this, i've got lots to talk about!  my overall mood as of late has been utter confusion.  i'm wondering when i gave up the power to make decisions about my life and my time and allowed others to make those decisions.  i just feel as though i'm being pulled in so many different directions.  i've been jobless for the past 3 weeks, so one would assume that i've had lots of free time to do as i please... not the case at ALL!  everyone else has their opinion about what i do and who i should spend it with, and i've had absolutely no time to myself.  complaining about this may sound stupid to some, but it's been difficult.  i've started dating- which has been super nice!  i've met guys that are truly great people, and so sweet.  doug buttered my banana bread the other day... and it made me realize, no one has ever done that for me before.  (i sound like that chick in america's sweethearts)  so dating has been very nice because i'm finally being pursued, cared about, respected, and taken care of.  it feels SO nice.  though, it's tough because there is more than one and they both call SO often.  gosh, i feel like such a tool complaining about something like this, but it's the truth... i just feel pulled in too many directions.  from these guys, from friends and from family- i want to scream "IT'S MY LIFE!"  anywho... i feel better now that i vented.  things with alan... i'll try my best to keep this short and sweet.  first of all, elaine visited on a tuesday (alan's x-girlfriend/my good friend) and it was SO WONDERFUL to see her and spend time with her.  at night we layed in my bed for hours talking about alan.  since we've both been through the "alan breakup" we have a lot in common and a lot to talk about.  we laughed and cried and eventually fell asleep.  was really good for me to have her here and to prepare me for alan's visit, which was the following day.  alan arrived on a wednesday and it was really nice to see him.  when i first saw him i hugged him and it honestly felt like home.  so good to see him again.  the 1st part of the trip was blissful, he's changed... grown up a lot since our breakup.  and he was super sweet and caring with me- it felt so nice to have that come from him.  but then came the middle of the trip (he flew to NY because he was the best man in a friend's wedding) when we were in rome, ny for the wedding... and things got emotional.  in one of our many car rides i suddenly burst into tears that would not stop flying out of my eyes!  i felt so confused, sad, hurt, annoyed, and alone.  the following 24 hours were difficult... i was crying most of them, along with fighting with alan.  this was the relationship with alan that i was used to (unfortunately)... the fighting and crying were all too familiar.  i'm not saying that's all my relationship with alan was, because i love alan and we had many, many, many absolutely wonderful times.  but towards the end of our relationship when we lived in different states, the crying and fighting were more frequent than i would have wished for.  :(  though, we did end on a good note... i realize that alan is an absolutely wonderful person and i still care about him very deeply.  but alan and i are not meant to be together as a couple- that is very clear to me.  and on an unrelated (to alan) note... the wedding was a BLAST!  i got to hang out with lots of his friends from high school again and i had a fabulous time.  they are some great folks and we partied like rockstars aaaaaaaaaaaaaaall weekend.    look for new pics,  urlLink

      well hellooooo there!  thanks to those of you who responded to my job drama- i've been thinking about it a lot, and i've decided to take the job at depaul and go from there.  i'll figure things out as i go... but i do know one thing for sure... i need $$$$$$!  i have   very   exciting news to share with all of you, my brother (my most favorite person in the whole world) proposed to his wonderful girlfriend, brigid on july 3rd!!!  i've been waiting soooooo long for this to happen, but it was well worth the wait.  i heard all the details from brigid and it sounds like my brother is a total sweetheart, and the ring is GORGEOUS!  good job, bri!!!!  i absolutely love brigid and i can't wait for her to be a part of my family (officially).    my weekend was pretty fun, after work on saturday i went out with a woman from work... she's 45 and spunky as a 21 year old.  ellen is a blast!  we met up with doug, so it was nice for her to meet him... she was quit impressed with him!  we've spent much of this weekend together (doug & i), which has been really fun!  he's a great person and i love hanging out with him... but i am scared to death of anything serious right now.  the timing for a relationship just isn't right for me right now.  hopefully this doesn't end up hurting him in any way.  i'll keep you posted.    i've got some visitors coming into town this week!  elaine is coming tomorrow, which i'm super excited about.  she's actually alan's x-girlfriend... may seem odd to some, but honestly i've gotta hand it to alan, he's got GREAT taste in women!  elaine is such a wonderful person- she's beautiful inside and out!  and i just can't wait to spend the day with her and show her my town.  :)  and alan's flying into town on wednesday night; we're going to his friends wedding in rome, ny this weekend.  i'm looking forward to seeing alan, i won't deny that i'm a bit nervous about how it will be, but for the most part i just can't wait to see him again!!!!!!!!  peace out.

      okay blog readers... i need your advice.  i don't often ask for it... but i'm really in limbo right now with the whole job situation.  so i was offered the job at DePaul, where i'd work as a residential mental health counselor.   pro's of working at depaul:  i wouldn't have to be trained, because i worked there throughout college; it would be a stable income, money and work that i could rely on; it would be great experience for me; i would feel passionate about the work i do   con's of working at depaul:   i would make enough to pay my bills but not too much more, it would be stressful and i'd easily get burnt out, and the hours kinda suck, i'd constantly be thinking about how cool the other jobs i applied to are, and wish i was working elsewhere...  so because i need a job real soon... i'm running out of money... part of me wants to take the depaul job for the time being while the other jobs that i applied for are making their decisions (it could be a month or longer until they do interviews and such).  these other jobs are AMAZING and the pay is about $12,000 more money that depaul would be!  but, then my conscious kicks in, and it would suck of me to work at depaul and then quit if something better comes along, right????  see- it's this whole commitment issue i have.  HELP ME PEOPLE- what are your thoughts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      i  love  my apartment!!!  melissa moved in this past weekend and it has been soooo great for both of us!  it's really nice living with a girl again... i missed it.  especially someone so considerate, clean, understanding, and real- things are going to work out well.  we had a good weekend driving the huge uhaul all around corfu, oakfield, rochester, and webster- i felt super badass driving that thing.  :)  unfortunately we had no one to help us move our furniture in... it was sunday evening and all of my friends were at bbq's or completely drunk (it was park ave fest) so that was a bit tough.  we thought we could get our new furniture in the apartment by ourselves, but sadly... we were wrong.  luckily our neighbors are amazing and they helped us!  yay.   on another note... ben has a new girl toy.  her name is brigette.  she's really pretty (and knows it).  aparently her name means "sex kitten."  and she makes weird faces when she's talking (about herself).  i will be the FIRST to admit... a portion of the reason i don't like her is because i don't see ben anymore, and that i miss.  but that is not even close to the majority of the reason i do not like her.  ben and i are best friends, i know him well- when we're all out together and he takes me aside to complain about how she's being selfish or mean, and then proceeds to sleep with her, kind of annoys me.  he's being super fake and thinking only with his penis about this whole situation.  there's so much  more, that i won't even bother going into... but i really miss my friends.  park ave fest was this past weekend, which is the best festival of the summer- and i didn't even hang out with any of them.. brigette always had to be there with ben (she can't leave his side), and i just get annoyed when she's around so why put myself through that!?  i have other friends, and i hung out with them... but i did miss those guys.  first and foremost ben and i had an amazing friendship... that i'm not willing to give up, but i feel like ben doesn't care about it anymore.  i feel like having a hot girl to fuck every night is much more important than real friendship.  i don't like being shit on...

      i often find myself doing things that aren't mentally healthy for me.  this is recent.  i feel like i'm falling apart.  i feel as if i started spinning months ago, and i haven't stopped.  things just keep happening, and i just keep going along with them, knowing full well that i shouldn't.  i've lost my common sense, i've lost my brains, i've lost all sense of organization in my life.  i'm scattered....
