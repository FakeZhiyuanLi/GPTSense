      Opportunities for wireless developers who use Java technology have never been so plentiful. Because traditional revenue streams have shrunk or at best stopped growing, network operators are in the midst of a cash drought. To increase revenues, mobility businesses are focusing heavily on the growing market of content delivery, namely games, messaging, and data services. And because most of the world is already using wireless Java technology with success, the mobility industry wants to help generate this new cash flow with Java technology-enabled applications.

      In Java applications that do text searching and manipulation, the StringTokenizer and String classes are used heavily. This can often result in complex code and lead to a maintenance nightmare.  Often such Java applications are looking for an occurrence of a particular character or token in a String, and then trying to find a string surrounding it, validating the extracted String.  Use java.util.regex package that makes string search and manipulation very easy.  [Resource-Type: Article, Category: Java/J2SE, Level: All, Java-Edition: J2SE, XRating: 3]

      I found these 7 tips from one of the newsletters of javaperformancetuning.com and loved to blog here. These tips are authored by Jayson Falkner. He has also authored "Servlets and JSP the J2EE Web Tier" Book. http://www.jspbook.com   #1 Database Connection Pooling - This is a well-established technique. Instead of opening a new database connection each time a query is done, a pool of several connections is shared. Tomcat provides fantastic built-in support for this via the Jakarta Commons Database Connection Pool API, http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/jndi-datasource-examples-howto.html.   #2 Don't read flat files from the hard disk. Reading information from the hard drive is really slow. In the JSP world there is a trivial fix to this. We save content as a JSP page, properly translated and encoded in any language. Tomcat automatically converts the JSP to a in-memory servlet the first time someone tries to view the page's content. Any dynamic information the page relies on, say links to pages describing the day's news, is passed around using the popular Model 2 design pattern. The result is that flat files are rarely ever read more than once from the hard drive.   #3 Server-Side Caching. A servlet filter that automatically caches content for you is trivial to deploy, and it can save enormous amounts of time. Here is a full writeup I did on this, http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/filters.html.   #4 Client-Side Caching. Set the HTTP response headers (i.e. Control-Cache) that tell a client what it can cache. That way users aren't downloading your header/footer images, style sheets, or javascript files multiple times. Here is a write up I did for this, http://www.jspbook.com/faq.jsp#1069699404218.   #5 Simplify everything. This is a trick taken from Google, but that some sites can't use. The technique is to trim down your content to the smallest amount of stuff you actually need. Ditch flashly DHTML in favor of plainly describing the content. Style things well using an external CSS file, don't embed styles. This results in your sever needing to send less information to a client, thus faster page download times.   #6 GZIP compress when possible. Most web browsers will accept GZIP compressed content (about 1/6th the size of normal content). Compress whenever possible and you will have to send less bytes to a user to convey the same information. Here is a writeup I did on this, http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/filters.html.   #7 Know what you are keeping in memory. Far too often I've seen nicely optimized sites crash because someone is abusing either the session or application scopes. Java can have memory leak(ish) stuff. You can't reference a billion objects and expect your JVM to handle it. Whenever you can, use only the request scope for passing objects between resources in your web application. If you must use application or session scope, ensure you eventually clean up the resource.

      If you require sending a large chuck of data as your servlet response to the client and want a faster performance then this article is a must read for you. The author recommends using Cache Filter and Compression Filter for better perfomance. A caching filter optimizes the time it takes to send back a response from your web server, and a compression filter optimizes the size of the content that you send from your web server to a user via the Internet.

      I strongly emphasise the fact that Open is not always Free and Free is not always Free of Responsibility and Support from the users. I posted this comment today at java.net to urge the industry members and development community to be more proactive and supportive. It is really a great set back to learn that those free products/services could not serve you more because of yourself. If this is going to be the payoff, nobody would involve himself into Open Source or Free projects.   So I recommend everyone take a resolution for this year. "Whenever I use any free product/service which fullfills my need and does add value to myself, I will contribute at my best possible level."   Remember, In case you are not able to contribute anything, atleast make it a point and write a letter of appreciation.   Once again, I thank you and congratulate you all to be a part of the Java Technology.   Eat... Sleep... Dream... only Java. Happy Coding....

      SWT was created to solve the problems existing in AWT (lack of functionality) and Swing (inconsistency with the native look and feel, and poor performance). This has been achieved by using a solution that lies between the two extreme approaches represented by AWT (using the smallest set of common features) and Swing (emulating everything). Like Swing, SWT provides a rich collection of widgets with all the functionality required by a modern UI -- but like AWT, SWT also makes use of the native widgets and libraries of the underlying platform.

      The Mobile Media API (MMAPI) is an optional package that supports multimedia applications on J2ME-enabled devices. This standard Java specification, defined by the Java Community Process (JCP) in JSR 135, is highly flexible. It has been designed to run with any protocol and format; for example, it doesn't specify that the implementation must support particular transport protocols such as HTTP or Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), or media formats such as MP3, MIDI, or MPEG-4   This article provides a technical overview of MMAPI's architecture and APIs, followed by a tutorial in which sample code demonstrates how MMAPI can be used to build multimedia-rich wireless Java applications. A complete media player is developed, and steps for testing it are provided.   [Resource-Type: Article; Category: J2ME/MMAPI, Level: IMD, XRating: 4]

      Two days back I received an evaluation copy of Java Desktop System aka JDS and here a First Look at Sun's revolutionary product. I will post the FirstLook:JDS in 7 parts covering all the features in detail.  Here is what I got bundled in my evaluation version:  Start Office 7, Web Browser(Mozilla), E-Mail client, Calendar, Java 2 Platform version 1.4.2_02, Media Player, Music Player and many other softwares built on Java.   The Beginning  My evaluation CD was meant to be run from the CD drive only and did not require me to install anything on my hard drive.  So now, the JDS is in my CD drive and I have changed my first boot device as CD.  JDS is detected and takes around 2 mins to start(Pretty good because it was all booted from drive and not from hard disk). I have a P4 at 1.9 GHz with 256 MB RAM.    Now the desktop appears and I see a very familier (to Windows) screen but yet with rich graphics. There are 4 icons present in the desktop as with any MS operating systems. "My Computer" which JDS calls "This Computer", "Recycle Bin" which JDS calls "Trash", "Network Neighbourhood" which JDS calls "Network.." and "My Documents" which JDS calls "Documents".  Alright, now its time to click on the "Start" which JDS calls "Launch" button. I click on Launch and get a very familier popup. Those who have used Linux previously would feel much more comfortable but otherwise there is nothing very complex about getting started.  I moved to "This Computer" and JDS has detected all the drives and partitions my computer had. Clicking on any drives would mount the device automatically to /mnt directory as in Linux systems.   The icons are very familier and customizable. An additional feature is the number of files and folders that are contained are also displayed with each folder icon (yes, same as GUIs seen in Linux).   Those who are new to *nix based system might find a bit uncomfortable while browsing the filesystem but it should not take more time to get on with it soon.   Players   I tried playing some music but.... sorry to say the player was very basic, like, MPlayer in windows. It did not have any plugins or DSP support. Simply putting a very basic and generic player.  I tried also playing a movie with .dat format but sorry to say that it was not recognized and I could not experience the performance. Conclusion: There needs to be some 3rd party players just like winamp venturing into this and getting us a richer entertainment.   Internet  I also had looked at the Browser and E-Mail client. The e-mail client is very similar to MS Outlook but in my honest opinion not as impressive. However, I might be feeling this because I am addicted to MS clients. The browser is mozilla and is very similar in looks as Netscape 6, but could be improved and more useful. I could not use it as I was running an eval. copy.   Office Tools  Star Office 7 is bundled along and it is quite similar to MS Office. Of course, again, not as impressive as MS Office but does have all the features. May be because of the installed fonts I did not love it.  I will blog a detailed look at SO7 as I explore more.   Hardware detection  Excellent. JDS detected all my hardwares including network adapters and USB ports. In fact, it also have a PDA interfacing application, so those who have Palm or other PDA would be able to sync their data.   Updates and Bugs  There are 2 direct links to updates and bug reports. Quite good :)   Accessories  Few java based applications are bundled as accessories. An image editor (better than MS Paint but nowhere comparable to Photoshop), JEdit for text editing and other java based applications. Stangely there was no basic notepad :( I would love to see a notepad for JDS and otherwise i would create one for the community to download from my site. Keep visiting http://www.xyling.com.  So thats all for this post. I am planning to write a detailed article exploring JDS.   [Resource-Type: Review, Category: OS/JDS, XRating: 5]

      The following rule book is taken from the JavaWorld article To Ejb or Not to Ejb (refer link to resource)   The rule book   At this stage, I list a set of rules to guide you in deciding whether or not to use EJB. That's basically what the EJB/no EJB decision boils down to: looking at your own unique project and applying these rules.    Rules for choosing EJB      Choose EJB when you know your application will need to scale beyond initial low usage levels and support multiple, concurrent users.    Choose EJB if you need transaction management. For online catalogues or read-only systems with low user numbers, you probably don't need EJB. For financial systems or any system where you must preserve the ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties, EJBs are a must.    Choose EJB if you need a comprehensive security model.       Rules for not choosing EJB      Do not use EJB when you find no need for scalability, transaction management, or security and anticipate low numbers of read-only users.   Don't choose EJB if you don't need platform independence and don't mind being locked into one particular vendor. This rule isn't designed to be sarcastic; intranet applications serve as a good example where I would like to see as little complication as possible. Indeed, a solution like .Net could prove highly successful in such situations, even in a beta release.    Do not choose EJB if your team possesses no EJB experience (and you don't plan on ramping up or importing such experience).    Do not use EJB just because your company got a free set of licenses from vendor X.

      This is a frequently asked question by the beginners and intermediate level EJB developers. These are the quick tips to find out when and when not to use EJB.  When is EJB best suited (in NO particular order)?    The application is larger in size. Understand the meaning and power of 'E' in EJB.   The application has multiple client types. Apart from web, if the client is a desktop or handheld system.   When you are require to take advantage of declarative middleware like instance pooling, transactions, security, container-managed persistence, container-managed relationships, and data caching. These had to hardcoded in case of mere java classes.   Because EJB is standardised, it is easier to maintain the code as compared to the java classes written by different developers. It is also easier for organization to hire and replace employees.   There is a requirement for clear and cleaner separation between the presentation and busniess layer.

      With the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) version 1.0, the Application Manager System (AMS) was the only means to start a MIDlet. Although the AMS is still ultimately responsible for installing, managing, starting, and stopping MIDlets, MIDP 2.0 applications can now be started based on a request from a remote connection or scheduled timer. This new feature brings with it a wealth of potential applications. For example, a remote application can push stock quote information on an hourly basis to a mobile device. Or how about this -- notifications from the corporate office can be sent to road warriors to alert them of schedule changes. Using the alarm feature, a MIDlet can now offer up reminders of scheduled events, such as a reminder of a meeting an hour before it begins.  This tutorial from IBM will walk through the basics of using Push technology with MIDP 2.0, including development of  a MIDlet that will be activated based on an incoming SMS message .

      Yeah... another year has passed by and now i have turned 16 ;-) Past year had been the most memorable for my life. Heres just a short list of the events   Got Married   On the 15th day of September I  tied my knot  registered myself having wed to the best girl in the universe(I found). Unlike the traditional way, I married the girl I loved. Its my belief that a person should marry  only  for LOVE.     Dream come True   urlLink Xyling Technologies . It is a dream that has realized after 3 years of continuous efforts. Now I could say myself and the world, NEVER LOSE HEART, dreams come true.. they really do.... The company is not meant to make money, it is meant to make life simpler. It has been conceived to assist people by blending the need and technology.    My Child Praised by the World   urlLink JACK - Java All Class reference Kit  is my BrainCHILD. I rember the day when I started learning Java and did not even know that Java has a rich set of API and that I can get a reference from the web or download something which we know it as documentation. That day JACK was conceived and on the first of the year 2004, it was delivered.  JACK had been well accepted by the developers across the globe and the number of visitors have grown to 600 a day since the time it has been launched. JACK had been listed on many popular Java based international portals and the press release of JACK could also be found on 20th January, Sun Microsystem's java.net website.  I always keep JACK handy, the shortcut I use to start JACK on my Windows machine is Ctrl+Alt+J.  JACK is a pure Java code and thats the reason it flies on any machine having JDK 1.2 or higher. Recently I tested it on Sun JDS without modifying even a bit of it and it did really well. Its good and its bad. Good because it is much faster and easier to use compared to the traditional HTML Docs, Bad because its addictive. You can use it to browse any java based API generally packaged into JAR and ZIP files.   Blogs...  Sometime back in October last year, I discovered this term blog. I tried learning more about blogging and now is the day, I run one of the most popular blogs on Java technology. Its been a month since I had made my blogs public and there are more than 350 RSS subscribers today.

      "'Push' is a very powerful concept and typically refers to the mechanism or ability to receive and act on information asynchronously, as information becomes available, instead of forcing the application to use synchronous polling techniques that increase resource use or latency.   This article will cover the new mechanism called the push registry, introduced in MIDP 2.0 (JSR 118). You'll start by finding out what the push registry comprises, see an overall description of its exposed API, and learn how to use this API to push-enable your application. The article will end by covering use of the version of the J2ME Wireless Toolkit that supports MIDP 2.0 to test your push-enabled MIDP application.

      Date and Time handling is fundamental to many applications. However, the classes supplied in Java have always been weak. Date should have been immutable, like String. Instead, it has many deprecated methods. Calendar makes accessing 'normal' dates difficult, due to the lack of simple methods. Calendar also has some strange performance characteristics.  The Joda Dates project seeks to provide an implementation of dates and times for the Java community. The 'default' calendar system implemented will be the ISO8601 standard. This specifies a framework for date and time independent of locale. Thus, in the standard, the first day of the week is Monday, and this has the index 1. This avoids any ambiguity across national boundaries.  Additional calendar systems supported are Gregorian, Julian, GregorianJulian (GJ), Buddhist and Coptic. The design is flexible and pluggable, so adding additional calendar systems should be easy.

      Its been years since I am awaiting for this technology to grant me some wish. The wish list has grown to the level high and like me many have lost their hope for this magic to happen.   I write this blog post about Jini because I am sure, for the belivers, the wish list is not yet trashed.  Somewhere within mind we have a positive thought about the power of this  dream factory  framework.  Although many believes that Jini is just an R&D subject or that it is good to frame  aladin  stories and tell it to the kids of Java Technology world, someone like me have still the faith this technology can really make wonders.    But How?  This is certaily a tough question, but here are some of the thoughts that I feel could boost this technology and come up a new world of opportunities.     Start Learning it. Theres hardly anything in it for those who are comfortable with Java and RMI   Strat experimenting it. Write some  Hello World  kinda programs.

      Sun Microsystem's chief executive Scott McNealy writes  "We're announcing a reduction in force of approximately 3300 employees worldwide. This is clearly the most unpleasant choice we've had to make, as  we've got the best, brightest, hardest working folks  in the industry at Sun, and it hurts to lose a single one. But I won't say this has been a difficult choice, because we know that  we need to improve shareholder value  and we need to assure our customers that we are financially fit and in this for the long haul, and the only way to do that is with aggressive cost-cutting measures in every part of our business."   I am not sure what these laid off employees are thinking about Sun, Java, Shareholders and their life as a whole but it really hurts to loose a job, that too after giving your heart and soul to make something that really counts. Ever hear Microsoft laying off people to do well in the stock market and improve the shareholder value? I am sure it could have done it (even though its doing really well).   This is not the first time ever that I have heard Sun laying off its staff. If at this rate, Sun starts removing people, who will innovate? Who will carry Java further, that too at a pace where the giant is slowly catching up the market.   I would like to ask everyone, if they have already started feeling the heat for .NET in the market?   As my friend says  "Winner is not the one who fights the hardest, but the one who survives the longest." . Till date, I was thinking and favoring Java not to be open sourced. But if Sun is finding it SO difficult to sustain, I feel its time to give up on Java.   Although silly, but I wish IBM could acquire Java, and maybe Sun.

      If your J2ME applications store or transmit sensitive or confidential data, you can make them more secure using data encryption. Devices that support the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), for example, are only required (in version 1.0) to support HTTP, not the secure HTTP protocol, HTTPS. The security of your data therefore depends on the security of the network. Even applications that don't transmit confidential data can benefit from data encryption. When run on a Palm OS-based device, for example, the record stores used by a MIDP application are actually Palm OS record databases. The MIDP runtime system controls access to the underlying record databases so that only applications running the same MIDlet suite can see each other's data. However, it's a trivial matter for an experienced Palm OS user to view and copy the contents of those databases independently from the MIDP runtime system. Encrypting the contents of a record store can defeat all but the most determined attackers.   This article explains how you can encrypt data to be transmitted or stored in an RMS for your J2ME application.  [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2ME; Level: ADV; XRating: 5]

      This tip addresses the question "when are two Strings equal?" Because they are objects, you can always compare the values of two Strings using the equals() method. If s1 and s2 are two Strings with the same value, then s1.equals(s2) is true. The tricky part comes when you try to use == to compare s1 and s2. In this tip you will see when s1 == s2 should return true.   A must read for all java beginners.  [Resource-Type: Tips; Category: Java/J2SE; Level: Beginner; XRating: 3]

      This Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language document contains the standard conventions that Sun follow and recommend that others follow. It covers filenames, file organization, indentation, comments, declarations, statements, white space, naming conventions, programming practices and includes a code example.   Why have code conventions? Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:  80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.  Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.  Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.  The Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language document was revised and updated on April 20, 1999.  PDF download also available.

      Is this a normal behaviour or a security issue? Recently, while working on my J2ME based project, I had to create my own TextField with some added features like a cursor. I planned extending the TextField class (package javax.microedition.lcdui) and add my own behaviour. But!! the members keyPressed, keyRelease and graphics object were all package protected. I desperately needed this behaviour and thought of one trick. I made MyTextField Class being in the package javax.microedition.lcdui (of course by the package declaration statement). And VOILA! it worked well....  So the next time whenever you need to excess any package protected variables (even if they belong to VM core classes) just put your class in the same package name.

      Internet seem to have become a basic necessity of life, but at the same time safety and privacy has gone for a toss. The culprit? of course malicious codes that are running behind without your knowledge, known as SPYWARES. More than Viruses and Worms, I am afraid of this stingy thing which is eating my bandwidth, security and privacy like hell.   In search of a hero to kill this monster, I discovered 2 excellent tools viz.  urlLink SpyBot Search and Destroy  and  urlLink SpyWare Blaster . Both are amazingly good and FREE, but still not 100% safe.  My hunt is still ON. I request you guys in the community to come forward and  POST YOUR COMMENT  regarding your experiences to deal with it and the tools that you know could help me safeguard my safety and privacy.  PS: Of course enabling FIREWALL protection is a good way to prevent security risks, I am looking for tools which can detect and remove the spywares.

      Over the last five years, a lot has been written about J2EE best practices. There now are probably 10 or more books, along with dozens of articles that provide insight into how J2EE applications should be written. In fact, there are so many resources, often with contradictory recommendations, navigating the maze has become an obstacle to adopting J2EE itself. To provide some simple guidance for customers entering this maze, IBM set out to compile the following 'top 10' list of what they feel are the most important best practices for J2EE. Unfortunately, 10 was not enough to capture everything that needed to be said, especially when you consider Web services development as a part of J2EE. Thus, in honor of the growth of J2EE, they have decided to make our 'top 10' list a 'top 12' list instead.   [Resource-Type: Tips; Category: Java/J2EE; Level: ADV; XRating: 5]

      If you think I am going to teach you  how to make your blog a cash cow  then you are right.  Maintaining an interesting public blog is certainly a good idea and a nice way to get recognized. But for many, that is not a sufficient reason to spend the hard earned money on a domain name, blogging service and hosting fees apart from the valuable time spent.  A traditional and good way to get monetary rewards is to display (RELEVANT) ads in your blog without sacrificing the user experience and the overall design.  But how to find advertisers and how much would they pay? Many Advertisers are searching for (right) blogs and websites to publish their ad and ready to pay based on the reputation of the site and the number of clicks they receive. But its tedious to keep track the number of links that are outgoing and maintaining an account and providing the necessary reports to the advertiser.  A common and probably the best workaround for this problem is to display ads from third party services. The most popular ones are Google (AdSense) and Overture. Like many other bloggies,  due to the  urlLink Program Policies , Google may not approve your application to display AdSense ads on your blog . Overture is another way to try but doesnt rate that well. Infact, even overture requires you to sign up with Commission Junction. Again, a mere waste of time with not much fruitful result.  How to get arond? Find out service providers providing similar services like Google AdSense program having lesser restrictions than popular programs like Google AdSense. One such pay per click program is  urlLink Adhearus . Adhearus, in many ways, better than Google's AdSense program. Apart from the choice of text and image ads, they also provide a right click on the ad that can be used by other advertisers to put ads on your site. The minumum amount they pay, for example, is four times the minimum amount Google pays per click. Also, the minimum amount that needs to be earned before receiving your check is also 1/5 of what other ad servies require.   How to get started?  Simple. Just fillup a simple form and Adhearus will have your site reviewed in hours and you can start earning. In fact you can start putting ads right after getting registered. You may   urlLink click here   to apply for adhearus pay per click program. They provide a javascript code that can be used to place in your HTML code. This reduces the tech-now-how required for you to get started apart from the marketing costs involved in getting advertisers to your site.  How much do you earn? Varies. Mainly on the theme of your blog, number of visitors and the targetted ads. But if you are lucky, you can atleast earn the domain registration and hosting charges. There is no gurantee on how much you can earn but if your blog is earning you profits, do cosider sharing the same with me ;)  Other ways to earn money. Place relevant affilate buttons of the sites that reward you on the basis of the clicks or customer sign ups. An example is hosting provider's affiliation that provide special discounts to the visitors visting your blog and pay you a nice percentage.  Once your blog becomes popular, you may also place an ad inviting sponsorship advertisement that run in a simpler fashion.  Let the advertiser pay you a fixed amount for a fixed period, irrespective of the number of clicks and impressions that are made.   Is it good to place ads on your blog? Yes. As far as the ads are relevant, un-annoying and add up some value to the visitor.  Happy blog earn ing!

      One of the most popular design patterns is the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. It's used when you want to separate your presentation code from the code that accesses the back-end containing your data. The back-end is typically a database, but it could be anything: a flat file on your hard disk, a message queue connecting to a mainframe, or a web service interface to some server.   This article from Java Boutique will walk you through DAO and using it in Apache Struts.  [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2EE; Level: ADV; XRating: 3.5]

      Tag files are one of the most important new additions to JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology, allowing Web developers to build libraries of custom tags with the JSP syntax. The JSP tag files are translated into Java code automatically by the JSP container through the same process that transparently produces Java Servlets from JSP pages. We could say that tag files hide the complexity of building custom JSP tag libraries. While such libraries can be reused across Web applications, they offer significant benefits even when designed for a specific application because custom tags improve the maintainability of the Web pages. After reading this article, you'll know how to create and use tag files and how to transform existing page fragments into tag files.   Use tags wisely in your programs, they can prove to be a performance overhead.  [Resouce-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2EE/JSP; Level: IMD; XRating: 4]

      This article examines two data management strategies available on the Java platform: Java object serialization and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). While neither data management strategy is inherently superior or inferior to the other, when it comes to managing enterprise information systems, JDBC wins hands down. In this article Java developers G.V.B. Subrahmanyam and Shankar Itchapurapu look at both serialization and JDBC, and through discussion and example show you why JDBC is your best bet.  You may also treat this as a crash course to JDBC and Serialization.  [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2SE/JDBC; Level: Beginner/IMD; XRating: 5]

      PayPal put me down :( Dear All,  This is with respect to the   urlLink announcement   made by Xyling Technologies for the final call to donate and get a fully functional lifetime copy of JACK. We got   urlLink complaints   saying US $20 has been charged for this product as shipping and handling cost.   Guys, there is something wrong at paypal. I was creating buttons for another offering from Xyling Technologies and to my strange discovery, that US $20 is charged to those opting for JACK. The donate button on my site had been left unchanged since the time it has been launched. Many developers have previously paid clicking the same button. I am not sure why this happened (right now suspecting PayPal bug).  Please treat this as a sincere apology and request to try again making your payment. Make sure you do not pay anything more than US $5(for a copy without free minor updates and user manual option), in case the shipping charges are apprearing again, click on the title of this blog post to pay directly.   Please note that the software would be available as a download and there will not be shipping of any type of media.    Sorry again for the inconvinience.

       urlLink JACK - Java All Class reference Kit , a product of Xyling Technologies is going to follow a commercial path in order to generate sufficient revenue for the enhancement of products and further R&D that the company is carrying out.  JACK is offered as a contributware/donaware, a term formed by Xyling Technologies to distribute its products.    So what is a Donaware/Contributware?  A Donaware/Contributware is a softaware that has no fixed/selling price. However, the author/company do expect some donations/contributions to be made in order to continue updating the existing products and develop new ones.   A Donaware/Contributware is not meant to be sold commercially which means the users of the software donate any amount at their will.    Why do everyone programming in Java need JACK?   Its quiet natural that developers/students go through API documentation or Books/Charts for getting the API reference and help.  But its tiring going through pages and finding what they want without knowing whether it exist really or not.  That's why JACK is so popular. Whether you simply need a powerful replacement for Documentation or a tool for browsing classes, methods, fields, constructors and packages.   JACK is designed to provide the power and functionality to satisfy the most demanding API references.  The edition of JACK will work with MS Windows 9x,me,NT/2000 and XP, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris and JDS.   JACK has been implemented according to the Accessible Software Design, so great attention has been paid to making it easy for both beginners and experienced users. Use of Multiple Document Interface (MDI) allows many packages to be analyzed simultaneously.   For purposes such as software development, JACK has all the necessary features for accelerating development. A software which we feel, is MUST FOR all who uses Java as their programming language either learning or developing applications.  A 10 days trial copy is also available for  urlLink download .   This is a FINAL CALL for all the interested users to donate and get a fully functional lifetime copy of JACK at just US $5.

      Java applications face a problem today: The only containment vessel available to them is the Java virtual machine (JVM) process itself. Multiple JVMs are required to isolate Java applications from each other, and this has two major negative impacts. The first is the start up time involved for each JVM invocation; the second is the memory footprint required by each JVM. Given these costs, and the inability to isolate applications within the JVM, it is clear that something fundamental needs to be done to resolve these issues. The answer? Shared classes. In this article, IBM Java Technology Center Development Team members Lakshmi Shankar, Simon Burns, and Roshan Nichani discuss the concepts behind shared classes in JVMs, how they work, and how this technology could potentially be exploited by users. They also discuss some of the current implementations of this technology and how it may be further exploited in the future.

The elaborate array of connectors among electronic devices cries out for a better solution. That's where Bluetooth comes in.   This article starts by presenting a brief overview of the technology, then explains:   -The differences between Bluetooth and two similar technologies, infrared and 802.11b -Features and future applications  -The architecture of Bluetooth and its protocol stack  -Network topologies  -Procedures for establishing connections  -The role of profiles  -Security considerations  -Products now on the market   Related Links:  urlLink Java APIs for Bluetooth    [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2ME; Level: ADV; XRating: 4]

      Wireless applications written in the Java programming language (wireless Java applications), like all other types of software, must be tested to ensure functionality and usability under all working conditions. Testing is even more important in the wireless world because working conditions vary a lot more than they do for most software. For example, wireless Java applications are developed on high-end desktop machines but deployed on handheld wireless devices with very different characteristics.   The aim of this article is to help you test your wireless applications. The article:   -Provides an overview of software testing  -Describes the challenges in testing wireless applications  -Presents a tutorial on testing wireless applications  -Furnishes testing checklists for user interface, networking, and other areas  -Discusses certification programs for applications targeted at the Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (J2ME applications)   [Resource-Type: Article; Category: Java/J2ME; Level: IMD/ADV; XRating: 4]

      Sun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy no longer directs his wrath against Microsoft. But he had plenty of rants and the opportunity to express them before thousands of Java software developers Tuesday.   What McNealy says is too harsh I suppose. I feel IBM has never envied Java but of course it has its eye on it and why not? IBM has been promoting Java (apart from earning from it) by putting all the efforts. I do not remeber any conference/seminar of IBM which is not focusing on Java technology. IBM also has a vast developer base and a strong urlLink developer community . It has also provided enough resources and licenses to the development community to better work with Java. It has also given leading development tools and app. servers to the industry that otherwise might have not opted for Java based solutions.  Merely asking to Open Source Java is also not the way out. IBM is mistaking here. Java needs a parent but a strong one and of course now, Sun is not THE ONE.  Related Links:  urlLink Where do 3300 employees of Sun Microsystems go?

      Brainbench welcomes its 5 millionth subscriber by announcing free tests from 1st of july through 14th of july 2004. Well.. it really sounds like MUSIC and that too ROCK MUSIC for the ears of brainbench certification aspirants but wait..... all has got jazzed up. What happens when an apple needs to be shared between 1000s of hungry men? of course everyone is left without a piece of it. Thats what exactly has happned with Brainbench. After announcing the free tests they did not take care for the high availability of the data through their servers. For more than half an hour i tried to just login, forget taking any test.  By the way how much difference does it make if you get these certifications. I and may be the community would like to know any success stories. Please share your comments.

      Object caching is an important aspect in the design and development of Web portals. In a typical Web portal application, we need the frequently accessed data in a JVM's memory, but, at the same time, we want the ability to automatically clear the data from memory when it's stale and refresh it with new data. Currently many open source implementations provide object caching in J2EE Web applications. This article describes a reusable object-caching framework created to cache data objects in a Web portal application. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into any Web application. Author Srini Penchikala discusses implementing object caching using three open source caching frameworks: Java Caching System, OSCache, and Java Object Cache. He presents these frameworks' installation and configuration details. Finally, he presents a performance comparison to show the effectiveness of caching objects.

      As is the case for ZIP files, JAR files are used to package multiple files together, such as classes, images, and sounds. You have a choice of tools to create JAR files. You can use the jar command-line tool that comes with the J2SE Software Development Kit (SDK) or you can use the classes in the java.util.jar package. Although the command-line tool allows you to add files to an existing JAR file, there is no way to programmatically add a file. Also, there is no way using the SDK or the command-line tool to delete a single file from a JAR or delete multiple files. Instead, to update an existing JAR file, you must create a new JAR file and copy any desired content from the old JAR file.

      If you are a JFC/Swing developer or you have worked on it, you know it well, how difficult/easy it is to layout the components in a Window or Dialog Box. Most of us (I guess) abstain ourselves from using Gridbag layout simply by thinking its difficult to learn and use. This issue from Sun Tech tips gives you the right direction for using Gridbag layout and helps you get out of your notion :)  [Resource-Type: Tip: Category: Java/J2SE/Swing; XRating: 3.5]

      J2EE developers often package their EJBs into JAR files and WEB modules (jsp/servlet/html) into WAR files. Another level of packaging is to create an EAR file that consist of JAR and/or WAR files. For creating such a file, you need to issue the following command   jar cvf file_name.ear ejb_file1.jar ejb_filen.jar web_file.war META-INF/   The META-INF directory contains a file named application.xml The application.xml file is the deployment descriptor for Enterprise Application Archives.   Link to resource is a page from the BEA docs that neatly describes various elements of this file and their usage.  [Resource-Type: Tip: Category: Java/J2EE; XRating: 3]

      We have all read that objects are software representations of real-world entities and that one of the first design tasks is identifying these entities in our problem domains. These entities then become classes of our applications. However, the object-oriented paradigm allows us to model not only entity objects, but any abstract concept for which behavior can be identified.

      This tip will show you how to write Java applications that can get past your corporate proxy and access Web servers on the Internet. Adding proxy support to your Java applications involves writing just a few additional lines of code and doesn't rely on any security "loopholes."

      This article will introduce techniques for making a JDBC connection through a HTTPS proxy server.  The IDS JDBC Driver is the only JDBC driver in the market that offers this firewall access capability.  However, some of the topics discussed here are also useful to other Java applet developers who have to deal with client-side firewall issues. The focus of this discussion is how a downloaded applet can make a JDBC connection to an IDS Server across the client-side firewall.   A Java applet on a public Web site can be downloaded and run by client computers inside their own firewall protected networks.  The only way for an applet to create a network connection to a server on the open Internet is by going through the client-side proxy server.  The difficulty here is that the client can be anonymous, so the applet has no prior knowledge of the client-side firewall and its proxy server.  Link to resource to view the whole article.

      How well does your application perform? It is probably one of the toughest questions to answer accurately. It is not only a question of how many requests your application serves per second or per minute, but also how your application scales with respect to other performance metrics. It remains challenging to quantify application health quickly because there are a number of variables to consider.

      Garbage collection is not the only issue preventing Java from being used for a real-time system. Other issues include thread scheduling, accurate timer, synchronization overhead, lock queuing order, class initialization, and maximum interrupt response latency. Until now it has definitively been a "stopper." Because of it, most real-time systems today are developed in C/C++ despite the existence of Java compilers.   Point to the Link to Resource  (title is the link)  for a detailed discussion for this topic and some pointers to the works on Java Real Time Systems.

      "If IBM acquires them, the community outrage and customer disaffection is going to be epic," says Sun's president and COO.  "IBM is in a real pickle," Schwartz wrote yesterday in his increasingly widely read  urlLink blog . "Red Hat's dominance leaves IBM almost entirely dependent upon SUSE/Novell. Whoever owns Novell controls the OS on which IBM's future depends. Now that's an interesting thought, isn't it?"

      If you have ever read the Java VM Specs and the  urlLink class file format  specifically, you know what I am talking about.   For others, they must have, atleast once in their lifetime, have come across the mighty error  "The Magic Numbers Did Not Match" .  Each class file in Java, has a related Structure(C programming lang.) internally. The first field of this Structure is a MAGIC NUMBER which defaults to 0xCAFEBABE.    The purpose of a magic number is to help tools quickly differentiate likely class files from non class files.   Those who are wondering, why the default CAFEBABE, may link to resource for some insight from the community members.  [Resource-Type: Weblink; Category: Java/VM; XRating: 4]
