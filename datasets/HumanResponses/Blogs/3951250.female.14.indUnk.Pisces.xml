Like the wind was blowing it apart. &nbsp;Had you spinning like a merry-go-round . Indications of a storm touching down . I wish that I could weather any storm. &nbsp;But I guess it was heartbreak from the norm. &nbsp;It was a day that I will always remember. &nbsp;The saddest day in sweet November.  &nbsp;Lately (I've been watching you) Been thinking about you baby (And everything you do)  Just sittin' away watching the days go by (watching the days go by) Lately (I've been watching you) Been thinking about you baby (And everything you do)  Just sittin' away watching the days go by.  Baby, I'm on my knees praying &nbsp;God help me pleaseBring my baby back, right back to me  &nbsp;If loving you is right then I don't want to go wrong  So I drown myself with tears  Sittin' here singing another sad love song Lately (I've been watching you) Been thinking about you baby (And everything you do)  Just sittin' away watching the days go by (watching the days go by)  Lately (I've been watching you)Been thinking about you baby (And everything you do)  Just sittin' away watching the days go byBaby  I've been torn apart I wish you hadn't broke my heartI'm missing you babe,  missing you everyday  Lately I've been torn apartwishing you hadn't broke my heart I'm missing you babe, missing you everyday  &nbsp;
