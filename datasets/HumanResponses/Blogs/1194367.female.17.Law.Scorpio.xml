      There was a much discussed case (Department of Education v. San Diego) back in college that I had to read several times when I was researching for my Legal Memorandum for Practicum.  It involved the rule on taking the NMAT* -- there was a three-time limit to taking the NMAT.  Once a person fails to pass the NMAT after taking it three times, he is therefore barred from taking it again.  There was a wonderful explanation by the ponente (writer of the decision) that became the often cited part of the case:   "While every person is entitled to aspire to be a doctor, he does not have a constitutional right to be a doctor.  This is true of any other calling in which the public interest is involved; and the closer the link, the longer the bridge to one's ambition...  ..A person cannot insist on being a physician if he will be a menace to his patients.  If one who wants to be a lawyer may prove better as a plumber, he should be so advised.  Of course, he may not be forced to be a plumber, but on the other hand he may not force his entry into the bar.  By the same token, a student who has demonstrated promise as a pianist cannot be shunted aside to take a course in nursing, however appropriate this career may be for others."    Why am I bringing this up?  I was reminded of this case after quickly browsing through the front page section of The Philippine Star.  Apparently, the Supreme Court has (finally!) imposed a new set of rules about taking the oh-so-difficult Bar Examinations, taken by students who have graduated from law school.  The new rules state that a bar examinee is now entitled to take the Bar Exams only FIVE times, after which he is barred from taking future Bar Exams.  I definitely approve this rule that they've just thought of.  My sister also mentioned to me last month that there was an ongoing petition trying to change 20% of the bar exams from essay to multiple choice.  CRAP.  CRAPPY-CRAP.  Sure, initial thought is:  "hey, multiple choice! There's a bigger chance of me getting those questions right!"  NOT.  Thing is, multiple choice also means all or nothing.  You don't get partial points for a wrong answer, unlike in an essay-type of exam.  I certainly hope that when my batchmates and I take the Bar, the Bar will still be comprised of essay-questions.    ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~    As I've said so so many times back in college, the thought of taking the bar just about gives me a heart attack (if it was actually possible at my age..) -- and then I realize that my sister's about to take the bar this September.  How the hell must she be feeling?      *National Medical Admission Test

      I'm still happy.  and I think I'm the only one who's deliriously happy.  But hey..what's the point in going to law school if all you'll just mope around?   Anyway, I got called today.  Twice.  I think it went rather well.  (yihee, favorite na ako ni JV!  Ibig sabihin..tatawagin na niya ako every meeting! hehehe.)  I can hardly wait for spider-man 2 to come out! I'm gonna watch it with sarah, kristina, kaiye and lorna.  oops, i forgot, sarah won't be going. ^__^     masaya..masaya uli ako... although i'm a quite disappointed with 'a series of unfortunate events.'  i was finally able to finish book 10 today and it didn't seem to have an ending. it didn't even leave me hanging. it just..stopped.  without an ending.            but i don't mind.  because i just found out that there'll be an upcoming movie of this series!  wooohooo! jim carrey will be starring as Count Olaf. (oh dear.. how hilarious.. :D hehe)  kaso sa december 17, 2004 pa ang labas. oh well.  i can wait :D which reminds me, there's this guy at church (a tall guy who wears eyeglasses..hehe.) who's probably still in high school -- anyway, for some reason, i really feel that he's Klaus grown up.         oh dear. i'm half-drooling over the picture.    meanwhile, Fil posted something about "The Notebook" coming out as a movie. oh my.  irish and i HAVE to watch that.  (even if it means having less time to study..)

      She could have been Harry Potter's sister.  She didn't have a scar on her forehead, but the short black --unruly-- hair of hers was the same color as that of Harry's.  She wore black-rimmed eyeglasses that almost hid her green eyes.  Her complexion was that of Snow White's, even after hours under the sun, it stayed a pale white.

      nakailang"ssssshhh!" na ako pero walang talab hanggang sa nabwiset ako at napa: "SSSSSHHHHH! for crying out loud be QUIET!!"  mabuti naman tumahimik din.  Natuwa naman ako ng lubusan dahil maganda ang pagkakagawa ng Harry Potter POA.  mas pinakita ang pagkabata noong mga karakter ng kwento, at natuwa din naman ako dahil lumabas ang humor ng kwento sa pelikulang ito.  ang gwapo ni D. R. at kuya benson, sana hindi ka nagselos kay ron dahil mukhang may .. "something" na sina ron at hermione. lol.  mahaba-haba pa dapat ang isusulat ko.. kaso nasabi na lahat ni  urlLink the_hierophant  sa kanyang entry. (read her latest entry.)     Saturday: June 5 wins, hands down, as my unluckiest day ever.  It all began when she, Danes, noticed that she was already in Buendia.  She then reminded the conductor of the bus to drop her off at Estrella.  The conductor nodded and went to the front of the bus, while Danes stood up at the sight of the overpass where she was to go to.  Unfortunately, the driver apparently didn't want to stop, and the conductor apparently forgot to tell the driver to stop at estrella.  Fortunately, the bus stopped so she hurriedly stepped down.  Unfortunately, she was not yet fully on the ground when the bus moved.  She therefore fell forward on the muddy cement and stood up looking like a wet (muddy) rag.  She, to no avail, tried to get the dirt off with tissue, but her pants were already filthy and sticking to her legs.  Her blue bag (which she had just cleaned a day ago) was smeared with mud, and so was her shirt, jacket and umbrella.  Once she had done her best to get rid of the mud on her hands and feet (she was wearing sandals that day -- she rarely wore them and wouldn't you know that the day she wore them would be the day she'd slip on mud.) she crossed the road.  Afterward, she tried to open her umbrella, but it wouldn't since the threads got intertwined when she fell down.  She stood there in the rain, looking at the shuttle station.  Well just her luck -- no shuttle in sight.  After two or three more minutes of standing in the rain and staring at the fishball the manong was cooking in front of her, a taxi arrived and she hailed it.  She got to school tired but still grinning.  She then went to the ladies' room and tried to fix herself up.  Her knee was aching and her pants were brown instead of its normal grayish color.  She rinsed her umbrella on the sink and tried opening it.  Of course it only then opened.  She muttered a sentence of pure swear words to herself, and aloud nonetheless.  Her tissue was about to run out so she got four pesos from her coin purse and inserted it in the slots in the vending machine.  Naturally, the machine ate her coins and refused to give her her rightfully owned tissue pack.  She slammed her fist on the machine several times but the stubborn tissue pack refused to fall.  After a few more swear words, she tried to clean herself.  She finished cleaning up in about twenty minutes.  Unfortunately there was no hiding the mud on her attire and on her bag.  She then went to Powerplant and proceeded to Fully Booked.  Her stomach was growling and she suddenly remembered that she had not eaten yet for that day.  Bummer.  She finished four books -- the three of which were the first three books in the series: "a series of unfortunate events", which seemed to be quite appropriate considering her day's number of mishaps.  The original time of arrival of the cases was 8:00.  It was moved to 8:30.  She got the cases at about 11:30.  She went home with Peewee, and her bad luck seemed to follow them home.  Peewee kindly offered to drive her near her house and to their surprise, they encountered surprisingly heavy traffic near Dampa (P-que).  Surprisingly because after 10 pm, there was usually very light traffic on the main road.  Danes looked at the car's clock and noticed that it was 12:07 am.  You would think that her bad luck would've ended with that day.  She told Peewee that and Peewee answered that that clock was ten minutes early.  At exactly 12:10, the heavy traffic disappeared.     Sunday: Woke up with a big purple-green bruise on right knee.  left hipbone ached and also had a bruise.  left hand also sported a bruise.  can't walk fast anymore.  felt sick the whole morning -- felt like throwing up the whole morning too.  (probably because of the lack of food intake yesterday)  feel better now.  though my limbs are still aching.  first class tomorrow. wish me luck.  haven't studied any of the readings yet.  broke promise to self to stop eating chips.

        first day of orientation. still excited and still no nerves bugging me.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~  a picture for me:     harhar. wala lang :D  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~     yay! i'm very happy.  I will be meeting with three of my first (close) high school friends, namely Lorna, Kaiye and Sarah.  I've seen Kaiye last February on her birthday while I haven't seen Lorna in a couple of years, and Sarah, a year i guess.  we'll be watching harry potter (..they were coerced. by me.) on friday at SM (we wanted to go to ATC but.. we didn't have any money. lol.) then we'll most likely just chat :D  yehey! masaya na naman uli ako.

      well, not really.  but tomorrow's my first day of the orientation seminar.  as usual, i'm surprised to see how time flies by.  Next thing you know I'm graduating from law school (with honors! hahahaha!) and studying for the bar.  the thought makes me cringe.  I'm happy that most of us from la salle are in the same class, but sometimes I think how fun it would be for me if I didn't know anyone in my class at first.  Of course, I'll still be a loner in the sense that no one's going to be sitting up in the front row (aisle!) with me, since my friends are the third-row kind of students.  Meanwhile,  urlLink Peewee  is nervous about our first class, Introduction to Law, to be held on June 7-11 where we shall be having a batch-class, with recitation nonetheless.  There must be something wrong with me since I'm not feeling nervous at all.  In fact, I'm even excited.    ~*~*~*~*~*~    I'll be watching harry Potter this weekend.  Hopefully.

      "Before we ask a farmer to pay a higher tax on his favorite gin, shouldn't we first remove the tax-free surgical procedure on a society matron who wants to have a J-Lo butt?"  --Palawan Representative Abraham Mitra  (The Philippine Star)      ~*~*~*~*~*~*~   &nbsp;  meanwhile, i think i may have gotten my first 60.&nbsp; I thought that when I'd get my first, er, 60, I would probably be marking my calendar or something, just so I'd be reminded of my first absolutely-horrible recitation.&nbsp; heh.&nbsp; surprisingly, i don't actually care that much. bakit kaya ganon?   am i becoming lazier everyday? just yesterday i wasted 45 precious minutes of study time in the library when this girl near me watched two episodes of FRIENDS on her laptop and though she had earphones, i still watched it from my very advantageous position (behind her) because i knew the episode quite well..&nbsp; naturally, i felt giggly while watching it and the bar reviewee seated to the table at my left was looking at me warily since I was holding several cases while trying to suppress my laughter.&nbsp; (e wala pa man din akong kasama sa table..)  Lalalala...  Finally, i finished AHWOSG! wahoo! I especially loved the slapping-the-elbow maneuver.&nbsp; I can't help but laugh whenever I remember that..

      people who hate to read? it's..inconceivable. at least it is to me. i love books! with the exception of those sci-fi kind of books, i read every genre i can get my hands on :D wala lang..weird.&nbsp; nakakaturn-off sa lalaki ang hindi mahilig magbasa. (para sa'kin) well..nagiiba talaga ang pagtingin ko sa isang tao (babae o lalake) pag sinasabi niyang "i hate reading!" &nbsp; &nbsp; wala lang. anlabo nila.&nbsp; (at may pagkadiscriminating pala ako no?)

      wow.  na-bingo ako sa crim kahapon a.  Naririnig ko na ang pagkanta ni sj ng "it's your birthday!" ng paulit-ulit.  Para akong gago kahapon -- nagpipigil ng tawa habang nagrerecite.  Sino ba namang hindi sisimangot sa bad trip.  e dalawang beses na ako natawag sa crim.  at nung nakita ko yung likod ng class card ko, hindi pala niya nagradean yung isa kong recit kaya isa lang yung nakarecord, kaya naman natawag ako kahapon.    bummer.   eto pala picture ng mga kaklase ko.  syempre hindi ako kasama! :)

      may ginawang liham ang kapatid ko na ipinadala niya sa kanyang mga kaibigan.  Pinabasa niya ito sa'kin dahil may kinalaman ito sa kabobohan ng mga tao sa pilipinas.  hindi ko alam kung tatawa ako o ipapapatay ko yang mga taong yoon.  kasi, nakikinig yung kapatid ko sa isang stasyon sa radyo dahil lagi doong pinapatugtog yung paborito niyang kanta.  e may dalawang DJ na magbibigay ng topic sabay sasabihin sa radyo kung ano yung mga text ng mga tao.  (note:  the following excerpt contains comments from my sister.) TOPIC: If you were president for a day, what would you do?   One texter wants to reorganize the government in order to avoid any "abuse of power."  DJ#1 goes:  "What's abuse of power?"  DJ#2:  you know, when you use your position for something not, uh, beneficial… 	 DJ#1:  Oh. 	 DJ#2:  Abuse of authority. 	 DJ#1:  Abuse of authority! Oh, okay!   The light dawns.  Never mind that technically, power and authority are different (although the words are often interchanged and used synonymously).  Naks, may natutunan ako sa Politics and Government nung college.  So, may nag-text ulit.  "Declare martial law to minimize criminality."  Kasi nga daw, the times… so criminal… gosh.. 	 DJ#2:  But there would be more crimes if there's martial law. 		 DJ#1:  Yeah. 	 DJ#2:  The situation would even be, I don't know..  aggravated.  	 DJ#1:   Exasperated.   (danes: EXASPERATED?? sheesh! this guy's vocabulary is twisted. and sadly lacking.)  They laugh.  So I'm assuming, hoping, they were joking. I think they were.  I refuse to believe they were not joking.  And, note, di ko na rin pinatulan ang comment nila about martial law.  Let the ignorant remain ignorant.    So there's another texter:  "No sex for a day because population is the root of poverty."  Punyemas.  One, population is not the root of poverty.  Two, how the freaking heck do you implement that?  Third, I think these texters once again fail to distinguish between the Executive Department and the Legislative Department.  The President has no power to legislate.  As Ron Weasley would say, "What a git."  And one of my favorite textbacks:  "Implement Filipino punctuality."  Amazingly (but not surprisingly) the DJs agreed with the texter.  After all, laging late ang mga Pinoy.  Filipino time nga daw.  Siiiiiiigh.  Again, I never knew that punctuality is  implemented .  Wagi ito.  And, even if, by any chance, we do implement punctuality, how do you do that????  Fine a person for every second he's late for anything?  Subject him to imprisonment for every hour of tardiness for particular events in his life??   Mind-boggling.  Anyway, on to the other texters:   "Give free medicine to the poor."   DJ#1:  But the poor already get free medicine!! 	 Me:  Huh??  DJ#1:  You know, they already get medicine from like, hmm, the GMA Kapuso Foundation (me:  tama ba? I don't know if this was what the DJ said, I don't remember, but I assume it's some charitable foundation set up by Channel 7) and other orgs like that---  Me:  Oh. My. God.  DJ#2:  Oh, yeah!! And they give out medicine during calamities or something like that…  DJ#1:  Or during storms..  Oh.  Okaaay.  So, wag na nating bigyan ng free medicine ang mga 'poor' kasi nga naman, binibigyan sila ng tempra o biogesic pag may bagyo.  Nga naman..  Grabe na ang katangahang ito.  Remember, diba, mga DJs, ang topic niyo ay tungkol sa presidente? Ibig sabihin, we're talking about the government.  Kaya pay nag-text sa inyo na magbibigay daw siya ng free medicine sa mga mahihirap, ibig sabihin non, ang naiisip niya, gobyerno ang magbibigay ng mga gamot na ito.  Hindi private charitable organizations.  Mga gunggong.    Another texter:   "Allow people to express themselves, like allowing people to work naked in the streets."   (danes: this one's a winner)  Me:  This guy is seriously repressed.   One texter wants to organize a  nationwide party ; another wants to impose a  higher tax on tobacco companies .  Again, forget about the fact that the President has (generally) no power to tax.    And a very weird person said he'll/she'll  collect all chocolates and build a mansion .  O diba.  Kaya mo yon.  But the worst of all was this one:  DJ#1:  Okay, texter no ___ says  "Implement the bridge program of the… what's this, uh, DepEd."   DJ#2:  What's the bridge program?  DJ#1:  What's DepEd?  DJ#2:  Deped?  DJ#1:  Yep.  It's capital D, e, p, capital E, then d.  Dj#2:  Sounds familiar, though…  Hindi nila alam ang Department of Education????!!!!!!!!!????????  Suddenly this bridge program makes more sense.  I swear, the spark plugs of these DJs aren't firing.  Sigh.  All this makes a person want to torture herself.
