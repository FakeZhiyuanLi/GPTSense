      june is an expensive month for me. i had my brother's birthday last week, my mother's next week, and my friend's this week. usually i don't have to buy my friend a pressie but she has invited me to a soiree of sorts on sat night (at mignight of all fukcing times when i have to work the next morning :P), so naturally i must get her a gift. i will most likely buy her something small from the market but she is quite hard to buy for. she is allergic to cheap metal jewelry, so if i bought her something like that it would have to have no metal in it.. and her house is pretty much the way she likes it, so i can't really get her something for her house. if i had the time i would've knitted her a nice scarf, but i only found out about the party the other day and i've barely had five seconds to myself since.   but i guess being busy is good.. working lots, went to a party last night which was fun in a geeky kinda way, and have lots more work and sewing to do.  on a bad note, i may be made part time at work. this is bad cause currently i work full time hours on casual pay, so making me full time will cut my pay in half.. not what i need when i'm trying to get to japan. i should find out for sure what's going on tomorrow, so here's hoping it all works out ok *crosses fingers and toes*

      i should be asleep right now.. i have been working for the past four days.. and i have two more days to go. today i was there for 10 hours. tomorrow i have to start at 8:30am, work till 6, and then do my radio show with my friend (who at least agreed to doing the show an hour earlier so that i can get home before 10pm), sleep, then get up at 6:30 so i can start work at 7:30am, work till 6, then get wasted at my friends house. i may very well pass out from exhaustion rather than drunkeness :P loki is kindly asking me to go to sleep, and i should, but i'm not tired, and its hard enough for me to get to sleep as it is, let alone when i'm not even tired. i should get off this computer and clean my room.. ha!  ah as much as i need all the money i can get at the moment, i'm gonna kill myself from overwork....

      i have a new obsession.. its the wonderful new universal currency that is the galacto. according to the craji bulgarian kids that invented it, it is the unified currency that we will use for financial transactions between us and extra terrestrials.  i found  urlLink  this article   on yahoo the other week and have been left with many unanswered questions. where can i get these galactos? will they be put on the foreign exchange? what will the exchange rate be between galactos and the australian dollar? i was determined to contact the creators of the galacto and find the answers to my questions.. but to no avail. no matter how hard i search, there seems to be no info about these people, the so called "Bulgarian Foundation on Cosmic Intelligence Research". i want to contact them! i want to tell them how excited i am, how i want to be part of their great project.. but no! if i can't get in contact with them, then how are extra terrestrials wishing to make financial transactions in galactos going to be able to contact them?!?!?!   on a more personal note.. life is good ^_^ i have a wonderful bf, and i have moneyz! hooray for everybody!

      sewing is a strange thing.. ask anyone who is talented in the craft. it takes a while to muster up the motivation, and when are motivated, you have to make the most of it and sew as much as you possibly can during that small amount of time you have, before you lose it and can't be fucked doing anymore. and it doens't take much to lose motivation - all you have to do is not have enough material, or make a mistake which would be complicated and time consuming to fix, and your work gets thrown back into the pile until the next time you can be bothered pulling out, dusting off and setting up the sewing machine. i truly believe that when i move out (ha! "when", that cracks me up everytime), if i could get a house with a spare room that i could convert into a sewing room, i may be more motivated to get stuff done cause the machine would be permanently set up, ready to go. but back to the trouble at hand.... i have two costumes to make by mid august. one is relatively simple, the other ridiculously complicated. i am about 75% of the way through the relatively simple costume.. i just need to sew on the trimmings and such. now i would've finished this last night, had i bought enough ribbon, but alas i did not. of course at the time i was still motivated, so i told myself that i would go to and buy some more ribbon today and finish it all off. instead, i slept in, and have been online since 1pm, lurking on various forums, checking emails (checking emails and kicking cheats until the day i die), reading random crap, and watching the first few episodes of wolf's rain, which is quite good (excellent soundtrack by yoko kanno, tho if you know her stuff, then you know that i expect nothing less but the best from her). i am working tomorrow, so the ribbon will be right under my nose. i will buy it. and seeing loki is working that somewhat stops me from being online, so i may just get this done by the end of tomorrow night... maybe.

      isn't it funny how somethings become habit so naturally? i would have to say while i was single the one thing i missed the most was just basic human contact. all i wanted was hugs, or even to sleep next to a friend just to feel the presence of someone else during my time of lonliness... so its only natural that now that i am in a relationship, that the two things i crave are to hug and sleep by my bf's side. i only saw him yesterday, but i'll be all sulky till i see him next... ah well, i guess at least i have someone to miss. on a lighter note, it seems my financial issues of last week may not be so bad for the next month or so, as i've picked up quite a few more hours at work this month. definitely can't complain.. execpt that i have less days off, but these are the sacrifices you make :P

      i think i need a psychologist. or maybe just a confidant. there's too much shit swimming around in my head at the moment and i'm having a lot of trouble making sense of it all. for the past two nights i have laid awake in bed thinking things thru, and have felt like i've gotten nowhere.. but then i think that i may not get anywhere even if i had someone to talk to about it all.  ok, thats not entirely true.. i have someone to talk to about all this - my bf. but its mainly got to do with my ex, and how many times can he listen to the same whining shit from me? and i'm scared that i'm gonna say the wrong thing when i'm just running thru thoughts and feelings that i have a lot of trouble verbalising. i know it stupid posting it here when he'll probably read it, but i just don't want to bother him with the same old crap time and time again. i fear losing him enough as it is, i don't want to fuck things up by complaining how my ex has fucked me up emotionally... he knows that already, i don't need to tell him anymore.  the person who doesn't know that is my ex, and i think thats whats bugging me. i'm angry, and upset. i'm angry that he was able to literally just walk off on me and not witness the consequences of his actions towards me. i'm upset cause i realise that he never did love me like he said he did. he's made it hard for me to trust, and that angers me. and he's made me question myself, and whether i'm worthy of being loved. words don't really cut it for me anymore, and (like all of us i guess) i've had to learn that the hard way. *sigh* ah, if only i'd smashed my beer bottle over the girl he left me for's head and then stabbed him with the neck when i saw him at the distillers gig like i wanted to.. sure i'd most likely be in jail right now,  but my mind would be clear.

      i think i have reached a crossroads in my saving plan for japan. on the one hand, i have the goal of finally getting to japan, something which i have dreamt of for 11 years and only this year have had the will and dedication to strive for it. on the other hand, i have my sanity. i have a very well paid job for my age, which definitely helps out when it comes to saving. but because i need to save so much in such a short amount of time, i am left with very little to spend on a weekly basis. after savings and board, i usually left with just over $100 dollars for petrol, food, bills (if i have any that week), and entertainment. this week, my bills were so overwhelming that i would've only had $10 for food and entertainment for a whole week. so naturally i had to lessen my japan savings so that i can actually live.  i am quite chuffed at myself for sticking thru this saving plan so far, cause i have done very well, but it still doesn't stop me from being bummed out when i have to choose between a movie with my bf, or a coke with my lunch (my bf won btw).  i just need to keep my eye on the prize, and hopefully it will end up being worth the sacrifices i'm making now.

      "what's this?" you say. another post already? but we just had to endure your last post! muwahahha! the way i see it, i can now just rant about random crap, and its up to other ppl to decide if its worth reading or not.. saves me having to type the same story again and again too :P  today i had a rather distressing conversation with one of my dressmaking teachers telling me that she had been in hospital because she inhaled a pin while trying to make her gown for the prestigious 'gown of the year' competition. at first she thought she had swallowed it, but after 6 hours wait in the hospital, she found out that she had in fact inhaled it and it was lodged in her lung. disgusting huh? but it made me think about how dangerous sewing actually can be. oh yes, all you ignorant fools out there have images of little old ladies sewing away, with only maybe pricking their finger on a needle every once in a while, but the reality is far worse.  i myself find that corset making is by far the worst of them all. and seeing i like a good corset, i also tend to injure myself quite often. first i will have various cuts UNDER my nail from pins going under there (don't ask how, i'm not really sure myself), as well as majorly scratched hands and sometimes wrists from all the pins that are holding the corset together which prick and scratch you while you are trying it on. and i will always slice open my finger when i attempt to make holes in the back for the eyelets to go thru. they need an ad awareness program i think. or maybe i'm just too clumsy and should look where i put my hands....

      Bah, this is really only a test blog. I could tell you how crappy my day has been so far, but do you really wanna hear my whining on my debut blog? I should be all "Oh wow! I have a blog! Yay for me! I am so exicted! You're all gonna love me!" Stuff that.  I've actually made this blog as in about four months I am going to Japan. Exciting, ne? I will be a kindergarden teacher for three months at this place called Chibikkoland which means little kiddy land in japanese. My boyfriend prefers to call it Chocobo Land. I think I would prefer to raise chocobos, but only if I got to do it in cosplay. But I digress... So yeah, the primary function of this blog is to share my tales of craji Japan with all my friends, so that I don't have to send out mass generic emails, and those emails I do send to ppl are more personal.  I don't know where exaclty I'm going yet, I have to wait for their call. But when I know, I'm sure everyone will hear about it!  bah, move along, nothing more to see here....

      quite a good night of viewing last night, was meant to see natural city as well, tho i'm so tired i needed the rest.   fuse  craji bosnian comedy about a town that cleans its act up for the upcoming visit from bill clinton. has some great moments in it. this was actually a 'filler' film: a film i pick to kill time between the movies i really wanna see. most of the time they are crap, but there are ones like these (and last years ones such as the brazillian film man of the year, and the swedish comedy kops), which i thoroughly enjoy.   infernal affairs 2  the prequel to the first film (yes i don't understand why they called it 2 if it's a prequel either), which really kills the tension cause you know which characters live on cause they're in the first film. still a good film none the less. the infernal affairs films revolve around the relationships between the hong kong police and the triads. what's more interesting is the people planted as moles in both groups: while there's a cop pretending to be a triad, there's a triad pretending to be a cop. fun stuff.

      been so busy, that i haven't had the chance to post day 7, so i have to do it together with day 8.   day 7    &nbsp;  nina  dark, interesting brazillian film about a young woman who spends too much time partying, not enough time earing money. her landlord whom she lives with is an evil witch, and is portrayed quite scarily. as she becomes more and more psychotic, nina begins to imagine things, shown in the form of her drawings. nice, stylised animation is mixed with live action to give a interesting effect. very enjoyable.   if you were me  bunch of south korean films funded by the national human rights council. stories about body image, people with brain damage, people who make their children have operations so that they speak english better (that one was hard to watch), and a story about a poor nepalese lady who was mistaken for a mentally ill korean lady, and detained in mental institutions for 6 years. the other ones were pretty boring.   warriors of heaven and earth  big budget, chinese historical epic, (with the fx done in melbourne) that fails to deliver in my opinion. most of the fight scenes are all blurry so you can't see what's going on, and the ending is rushed. the only good part was the battle at the lone fortress, which was pretty awesome.   day 8    &nbsp;  dragon head  japanese film about the end of the world. interesting effects, but the story kinda goes downhill. the main girl was soooo whiny and so annoying, she shoulda been killed off early.    sword in the moon  korean epic which for once wasnt five hours long. quite good fight scenes too.. the evil dude looked like some korean 19th century version of sephiroth. quite enjoyable tho and worth a watch.    nobody knows  very very very very good japanese movie about a mother who leaves her four children in osaka to fend for herselves while she marries a man in osaka. very sad, almost heartwrenching at times. a must see.

      small one today, as i ended up not going to all the movies i had planned due to me stressing about my costumes. tho i did go home and finish my corset, so it was worth it.    golden swallow  no its not a porn film. another movie by cheng cheh, of blood brothers fame. this movie was by no means as good as blood brothers. sure, there was a guy called wang, but it wasn't the same. dodgy story about a female killer known as golden swallow, whose old flame, silver roc searches for her across the land. nothing really worthwhile mentioning about it except for the guys known as the 'five heroes', who wore some kind of kung fu bondage outfits, and bow ties on their heads. dont waste your time on this film, it wasn't half the classic blood brothers was.

      only one film today, as my hours at work changed (as of today even tho i was only notified this morning). i'm not getting as much money as i was, so it puts a dint in my saving plan, but i should still have enough money to get to japan in januray for a month... it just shits me that i can't go and work over there in october like i had hoped.    one missed call  takashi miike - modern film making genius. great film from what is currently an overdone style of the horror genre (films like ring,  urlLink dark water , the grudge, etc). basically, the victims recieve a call from their own phone (with a ringtone that is not their's.. the ringtone is always the same one: a children's song, y'know that tinny kinda sound that you hear in baby toys? creepy as...), and the message that is left is from a few days in advance, with the sound of them dying (one person even has a video message of them being killed, which becomes more and more detailled each time they look at it). i will forever shudder whenever i hear the sound of an asthma inhaler.  some very cool imagery, stuff which could only be takashi's work. i'm amazed he hasn't really entered this genre before, tho  urlLink gozu  did have some freaky scenes (like the guy in the corner with the horses head), and seeing he makes an average of 6 films a year, it will be interesting to see what he makes next.&nbsp;   big day tomorrow.. starting at 12 ish.. was gonna go right thru till 11:30 or so, but i need to get some of my costume done, and i need loki's help for it, so its off to his house! also, we're gonna watch  urlLink  you got served  which i can't wait to see how dodgy that is.

      this review for day 3 is a bit late, cause i haven't really had access to a computer for the last few days..   the blood brothers  what can i say.. i haven't laughed so hard at a movie in such a long time. an old chinese classic by director cheng cheh, who john woo worked under for many years. i don't really know what the film was about.. and i don't really care. ok i lie. its about three guys: Ma, Zhang and Wang (yes thats right, WANG), who consider each other to be brothers, and take over the long hair group (or something like that, the subtitles were impossible to understand..).. Ma ends up getting some important position in the military, but not before wooing Madame Wang, Wang's wife.  the highlight of this great film? the death rolls. everytime someone died, they would have to either die of over acting, or roll down a hill. and the camera would always cut away from the action to follow them down the hill. fun for the whole family.   raja  well this was an interesting change for a film. after so many quiet, meditative films, i find one that is very much dialogue driven. i don't think there was more than 30 seconds of silence between dialogue throughout the whole film, except when they were kissing.&nbsp;a nice film about a french man in his 40s living in morocco, who is attracted to 19 year old raja, who works for him. she is also attracted to him, but plays hard to get most of the film. i missed the last ten minutes cause&nbsp;i had to meet loki before the start of the next film, but i'm sure it will be shown on sbs about fifty times, its that kinda film.    the eye  well this was interesting. i had heard about this film for some time, and was expecting it to be a lot scarier than it was. it was certainly a tense film, and had some images that i'm sure will stay in my head to freak me out for some time, but it could've been a lot scarier.  the movie is about a woman who has been blind all her life, and undergoes a cornea transplant, and is able to see. but she is also able to see ghosts, and these dudes who are kinda like the grim reaper, taking the spirits away. some of these spirits were really freaky, like the lady in the caligraphy class who demands that she get out of her seat. not a great film overall, but still worth a watch, especially if you like that kinda horror film (ie: ring, the grudge, etc.)  &nbsp;there is no review of day 4 cause i didn't go to the film festival last night.. instead i spent 4 1/2 hours gaming away at galactic circus.. which was lotsa fun. played parapara for the first time, and i think its my new fave game, cause you dance to initial d songs, and seeing i know them all i sing along too! Loki and i played some craji firefighting game, which was shockingly bad.. Loki's hose didn't even work, so i had to save the house all by myself! also hogged the premiere2 machine (which is like a korean &nbsp;DDR, but with the feet in different positions), which was what i first learnt on (cause all the DDR machines were always taken :P). I hadn't played it in about a year, and it was so cool to pass songs that i remember being so hard.

      i know its only the second day, but so far i seem to see one standout film and two mediocre films.. lets hope that changes tonight. the problem with last night was that i enjoyed the first film so much that nothing seemed to reach the same level of enjoyment after that.    bright future  this film was just great. i enjoyed every minute of it. the story is about 24 yr old nimura, who lacks social skills, and freaks out at situations he can't handle. he befriends 27yr old mamoru, who helps him out, by telling him when to wait, and when to go ahead (in life). mamoru also owns a cool pet jellyfish, which he is trying to climatise to freshwater.&nbsp;mamoru ends up killing their boss, and gives the jellyfish to nimura. now in jail and facing the death penalty, mamoru mentors nimura from behind bars, as nimura is lost without him. much to his distress, nimura loses the jellyfish in the river. mamrou ends up killing himself, leaving nimura a message to go ahead. nimura then befriends mamoru's father, and they go on a quest for the lost jellyfish.  i so want a pet jellyfish after this movie.. it was just so wonderful in every way. i have yet to see the director's other films, tho a friend is going to lend them to me, so i can't wait to see them!   road to koktebel  slow, russian film about a father and son who travel on foot from moscow to crimea to his sisters house to start anew. there was nothing terribly wrong with this film, but there was nothing that blew me away either. a lot of the jolty camerawork did annoy me tho, as i found it impossible to focus on anything sometimes. there was some beautiful imagery tho, especially at the end in crimea. gives the impression that russia outside of moscow is a very underdeveloped country, which i'm not suprised about.    azumi  once again, another movie i had high hopes for and failed to deliver. the review in the festival guide claimed it has "some of the most impressive swordplay in the history of samurai epics". the swordplay was shit. i could do a better job and i've never held a sword in my life. azumi was far too cutesy a character to be a cool, arse kicking chick.. and the special effects were something out of the 80's. i'm pretty sure it was CG, but it looked like chromakey. it was silly, i'll give it that, and it didn't take itself seriously, which is good, but from what i had heard, i thought it was gonna be a lot better. if you want a cool arse kicking japanese chick film, see the princess blade instead.. the girl is way cooler.

      the film festival started yesterday. i saw three films and thought that i would do a little review on each film that i see for you all...^_^   graveyard of honour  this japanese yakuza film by one of my fave japanese directors, takashi miike, kinda disappointed me. sure, it had all the violence that you see in his films.. and it had its craji moments, but it just wasn't really memorable. it tells the story of ishimatsu, and guy who becomes a yakuza aniki or older brother at the age of 20. the guy is an arrogant prick, who throws his weight around wherever he goes.. most upsetting to me was his relationship with chieko, a lady who we first see him rape, and later find out is his wife.. he flits between treating her with kindness and treating her like utter shit, yet she still loves him. if you have never seen a takashi miike film, don't start with this one, cause it isn't a good example of his work.   samaritan girl  aah the koreans.. in the past three or four years, south korea has become a force to be reckoned with in the world of asian cinema.. most of my stand out films of past film festivals have been korean. so i had high hopes for kim ki duk's latest addition, and it didn't let me down. a sad story about two teenage girls who, in order to save up some money to get to europe, have sex with older men for money. one girl is the prostitute, while the other is her manager, setting up meetings online. sadly, the prostitute jumps out of a window when cops bust her(cause she is a complete dickhead and thinks she'll be safe jumping from the third floor), and later on dies. this prompts the other girl (who feels she no longer has a need for the money) to sleep with all the men who her friend slept with, tell them that she had died, and return their money. i know it sounds strange, but i really enjoyed this film.   goodbye, dragon inn  oh, if only this film was a nic 20 min short film, where all the good parts were put together.. but no! this film stole 88 mins of my life and i want them back! it was horrible! whoever thought that watching ppl in a cinema was a great film? i had to watch the lady who ran the place drag her leg about(as it was in a brace) as she flushed toilets, ate a bun, and tried to find the projectionist to give him the other half of the bun. the only highlight was the japanese guy, who kept on moving about in the cinema cause of the obnoxious ppl who were near him (if only i had such a luxury.. the guy next to me stank, and whoever was behind me thought that it was a good idea to kick their jacket at me!! >.

      loki is in adelaide for  urlLink &nbsp;avcon  &nbsp;this weekend. i haven't seen him since wednesday, and i probably won't see him till this coming wednesday. thats one week. thats the longest i think i've gone without seeing him, and i've only communicated to him thru the odd online msg or sms. i'm missing him lots. what may be worse is that i&nbsp;have very little of a life without him. i have friends, but their lifestyles don't really mesh with mine, so i don't get to see them much. &nbsp; been working heaps this week. three more days to go and i finally have&nbsp; a day off. i've been doing ten hour days, and full on ones at that, where lots of heavy lifting is involved. but oddly enough i've been quite happy to go to work.. i joked that it was cause i haven't been serving customers, but i was serving the past two days and i've enjoyed it too. maybe i just needed to re-adjust to the new managers and the way they wanted things done..... &nbsp; i got my film festival pass on friday, and booked all my tickets! it starts on thursday and i can't wait to spend twelve hours in a cinema, watching many interesting films(and some completely boring, as is the uncertainty of quality at the film festival), most of them being from asia.  &nbsp; costume update: i redid a couple of my hairsticks as i wasn't fully happy with how they had turned out, but now they look really great! i have one more to make, and i will most definitely post photos of them when they're done! &nbsp;

            What Is Your Battle Cry?        S printing along the steppes, brandishing a vorpal blade, cometh  Simone Rule ! And she gives a booming roar:    "I'm going to fuck you for such a long time, Buddha will explode!"         Find out!  Enter username:   Are you  a girl, or  a guy ?         created by  urlLink  beatings    :  powered by  urlLink  monkeys         hehe, found this on someone else's blog.. it amused me greatly. and scarily enough, the battle cry suits me.. i mean its got fucking and exploding and all.   its  urlLink film festival   time next week! and i have been crajily working out what films i wish to see.. but i have one problem. i bought a pass a few months ago and paid postage and handling, so logically one would assume that i would be getting it sent to me. but the box office has been open for two days now, and i havent' seen my pass yet, and i can't book my tickets without my pass! i'm gonna have to call them i think and see what is going on. so far i have 54 movies on my list. soo excited ^_^ somehow i have to fit making my costumes time in there, but we'll worry about that later.  i am finally starting tai chi on the 4th of august. very much excited - been wanting to do it for a long time. and the price is pretty damn cheap.. works out to about $7 a week, so thats good for me and my tight budget.   laser skirmish tonight! w00t! should be lots of fun, even tho i'm a complete n00b to all this, as i've never been to dark zone or anything like that. i'll most likely be used as a sacrifice and run around crajily shooting randomly and inanimate objects instead of the other team.   costume update: i've started on my hairsticks for lulu. i've done one, and tomorrow i need to buy a bunch of beads to do the rest. i've strayed from the original design, but seeing i lack time, i can no longer be fucked being pedantic over the whole thing.. and these ones are gonna look classier in my opinion. and if lulu were real, i think she'd be wearing pretty, sparkly jewellery and hairsticks over plasticy ones. why wear all that fur, leather and lace to have only shity accessories? well thats just my opinon (and my justification for making the hairsticks the way i am :P)

      i spent ages the other night typing up a post for this blog, only to have errors and it wont show, so here is a somewhat updated and edited version of it:  dear god, this is turning into one of those whiny blogs everyone hates...it was never meant to be this way! but alas, i, like so many ppl in the world, need to vent their frustrations.. and posting it on the internet where no one will read it seems to be a far safer option than violence.  i hate work. now i know everyone says that about their mediocre jobs, but at the moment i realy mean it. i used to grumble about going to work, even tho i knew that when i would get there, it wouldn't be so bad after all. for the past two weeks, i have grumbled about going to work, got to work to find i was right to grumble about going to work, and then finish the day with a headache. today i was so stressed out and upset that i was in tears about going.. i just didn't want to go back. i think my managers got the point that i was pissed off cause they avoided me all day. smart little cookies. i really don't want to be at a place that makes me feel like that. for all its bad points, it used to be a pretty good place to work, but now the managers are bitches and everyone is so depressed and hates being there that the overall atmosphere of the place is horrible. i need to find a new job, and soon.   update: since i wrote that on wed night, thinfs at work have seemed to get a bit better. hopefully they continue to get better, to the point where i enjoy going to work!   on a lighter note: i've spent the past week sleeping next to loki ^_^ its so nice to wake up next to the one you love.. theres something comforting about it. i have to make the most of the next few days with him tho cause i'm gonna be so busy that i won't see much of him the next few weeks!  update: i think i've seen loki 10 nights in a row.. which is the most so far.. and i'm not sick of him, which is a good sign..lol tonight however will probably be the last night i sleep next to him for about a week and a half, cause i have to work more hours than normal, and he's off to AVcon in adelaide for about 4 or 5 days at the end of next week. i really wanted to go along, but i've spent so much money on the film festival which starts in two weeks that i can't afford to spend anymore. i will get to see him on tue when we go laser skirmishin', which should be heaps of fun.  costume update:  i made a cactuar yesterday!! it is sooo cute! ^_^  unfortunately tho, that's all i have made these past couple of weeks.. and i pretty much have no more free days to sew from now until manifest. so i'll be overworking myself with work and sewing till the wee hours of the morn :P  update: still, just a potato.

      ok, so i'm in limbo with my hours and pay and such.. they will "review" it all at the beginning of august. i had planned to leave in october. at the moment i don't think i'm going anywhere soon. this depresses me. what depresses me even more is that i will be stuck in a job i dont want to be in, but have very little choice cause i need all the money i can get, and i am not willing to sell my body (it seems i have already sold my soul to this company, and possibly my first born, i didn't read the fine print of the work agreement properly).  the new managers started this week, and already they have sucked the life out of the place. the one reason i liked working there was that it wasn't like every other store who did everything by the book, which ended up making life hard for both the customer and the staff, resulting in the staff being abused by an understandably pissed off customer. today i was abused or just generally treated like shit by at least 5 customers.. thats enough to wreck my day. my productivity was questioned because i was too busy serving customers to clean up and put out stock.  shit, i'm sorry i'm making money for you, i'll ignore ppl next time and make sure the place is spotless and stocked up before i even think of looking at a customer, let alone serve them.  i have gone back to not wanting to go to work, which is something i haven't felt for about three months..thanks alot ppl for making my workplace dull, lifeless and stressful.   have shitloads of stuff to do interms of sewing my costumes, but have been too tired lately to do anything. can't make anymore excuses.. i'll have to get my arse into gear tomorrow night, and may have to work on my costumes every night until i get them done.. between this and work i'm a nervous wreck. need to get to japan.. need a holiday!!!!

      IT'S OVER!!!  i was meant to write this up a couple of days ago but i've been preoccupied with my costume for manifest this weekend. because of that, my thoughts are no longer fresh in my head, so i'll most likely forget something i wanted to mention.   short films   with a number of the films i saw, a short film accompanied the feature. i haven't mentioned the films previously, but i thought i would now   the giant (screened with goodbye, dragon inn)  a russian short film about a guy who walks on stilts, who comes to a small town. the film follows his day as the town 'sundial'. there are 12 rocks on the ground to represent the hours, while he stands there on his stilts, with a pointy bird cage on his head. his shadow looks just like a clock hand. a young girl befriends him, helps him out throughout the day, and learns about his past at night through a series of photos that he shows her. (there is no dialogue in the film). in the middle of the night, little shits take his stilts, and he leaves the town, leaving the young girl devastated. a nice short film, nice imagery, and a good story. much enjoyed.   aspiration (screened with bright future)  this was crap. it made no sense. and i discussed it with someone who also saw it and they agreed that it was crap. a guy, for some reason, is attacking his car (which is on the beach) with a hammer, hammering down all the handles and locks. he then gets in the car and the car is washed away. thats the basics of it, tho you have to sit there for five minutes and stare at a guy who is staring into space, while you hear the sea become louder and louder. thats it. boring as all fuck.   talking with angels (screened with hotel)  of if only they had made this into an 82 minute film, and hotel into a 12 minute short film. this is the sad tale of a mother, who clearly has some mental illness of some sort, and her oldest son, who is torn between his embarrassment of her, and his need to protect her from the harsh world that makes fun of her. the mother leaves the house wearing nothing but a lace curtain, and he demands that she put at least a coat on. later in the street, he sees boys his age, and he lags behind his mum, so that they don't connect her to him. then at the doctors, the receptionist makes scathing comments to a patient about her, and he defends her, and later trashes the waiting room in retaliation. if this had enough funding, it could've been a terribly sad, but potentially good feature film. hopefully the director gets funding to do so soon.   guy maddin's sissy boy slap   party (screened with cowards bend the knee)  sissy boy slap party was actually the first of three short films that were all shown together, but it was the one that stuck in my head the most. for some reason, a bunch of topless gay men lie around doing nothing. when the old man leaves, warning "and no slapping" a huge slapfest begin, complete with squealing. the slap fest turns rather sexual until they are all lying in a heap, exhausted. for some reason one man's pants are half down, and when the old man comes back her parks his bike in the guys arse. they get scolded and thats the end. strange. the other two i can't even remember, so i can't comment.   best films  my highlights of the festival would definitely have to be (in no particular order):  samaritan girl   bright future   nobody knows   nine souls   get up!   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring      fuse would have to be my favourite suprise filler film. blood brothers would have to be my favourite dodgy action film. switchblade romance was my fave of the more mainstream films.     worst films  luckily there weren't many on this list, but the worst would have to be:  hotel   goodbye, dragon inn   golden swallow      the rest of the films were all still good, just not stand out. if you were me was on the lower end, with some of the films being good, and others being crappy.     f00dz  i'd have to thank bubble cup, the bun shop in chinatown that i go to, china bar, and hungry jack's for feeding me over the past few weeks. i won't thank flora tho for over priced curry that wasn't very good.  and thats it for another year. i know i'll definitely go again next year, cause even though i get burnt out, i love it. ^_^ its my escapism for the year.   costume update: two more days till manifest. i still have a lot to do, but i'm sure i'll get it done. i'll just have to work my arse off.

      didn't go to the film festival on days 14 & 15, as it was loki's  urlLink birthday  on thursday, so i spent that time chillin' with him.   day 16      cowards bend the knee  interesting silent film about a guy who seems to fall in and out of love rather easily. it started off strange, ended up getting even stranger, but wasn't that bad a movie. director guy maddin seems to like to use old film making methods, which is almost a novelty to watch these days. an interesting one to watch.  had more movies planned for this day, but never saw them cause i was too buggered.   day 17      darkness bride  i was expecting this to be a lot darker and eerie than it was. some random virgin who opted to kill herself instead of losing her chastity to a bunch of rapists haunts a small chinese town. another woman, qing hua, has some strange relationship with two men whom she has grown up with all her life. she marries sissy (yes thats his name, and its appropriate), but it seems she like cheung (i think that was his name) better. sissy ends up following his sheep to the city, where he meets the virgin ghost, who has taken the physical form of a prostitute, yan yan. qing and cheung chase after him, and qing is jealous of sissy's relationship with the virgin (btw, its not really clear that she is the ghost at this point, qing just starts rambling on about it, as tho we're meant to know this), and soon both qing and yan yan are competing for both the men's attention. it all ends strangely when yan yan uses the guys for their money, and their paths all seem to split up. i'm not really sure what to make of this film. it was alright, but then it just got weird towards the end.. and the ending was just stupid. not really worth seeing in my opinion.   zatoichi  this would have had to have been one of my most wanted to see of this festival. and it didn't let me down. takeshi kitano's remake of akira kurosawa's  urlLink yojimbo , this was a very enjoyable film. even the strange dancing at the end was good in my opnion. in fact, i really liked how the music was coreographed with the movements of the ppl in the village throughout the whole film. the only problem i had with the film was that it chose to do all the violence in cg. the swords and blood were clearly added, and even tho it was very violent in parts, it didn't affect me cause i didn't find it realistic enough. despite that, it was an excellent film, and seeing that its going to be released here soon, i demand that everyone must see it.   end of the century: the story of the ramones  the ramones have kinda been a part of my musical life all along in the background, tho they've only come to the forefront twice: once when my friend in high school became a punk and subjected us to the ramones at every party, and more recently when my brother really got into them. the documentary really made me dislike most of them. they're all pricks except for joey, johnny is especially an arsehole. he didn't even go to joey's funeral. in fact, i'm amazed they lasted 25 years with all the constant conflict they had. a very interesting documentary that had great live footage. i had to stop myself from singing along with the songs, tho i heard some ppl in the audience do so.   human touch  this film started 30 mins late, so i never saw the end unfortunately.  the token australian film for the festival, human touch was quite a good film from what i saw of it. i believe that it is getting general release here soon, so i think i will have to check it out to see what happens in the end.   breaking news  hong kong action film that was very cool. a shootout is caught on tape and gives the police a bad reputation. the police use the next hostage situation as a chance to manipulate the media in order to make themselves look good again. the main actress had the most annoying large eyebrows since vin diesel's sister in fast and the furious. besides that, a good movie.   spring, summer, fall, winter... and spring  absolutely beautiful story about the life of a korean buddhist monk, the various stages of his life broken up into seasons. written and directed by kim ki duk (samaritan girl), this film may possibly be the best of the festival. nothing was wrong with it. nothing. i just sat there and enjoyed every minute of it.   running on karma  two johnny to films in one day! directed by the same guy who did breaking news, this film was about a monk who could see people's karma just before or after they died. he leaves the monastery to (for some reason) become a beef cake stripper, and ends up determined to save the life of a police woman who has bad karma because of a japanese soldier in ww2. the ending wasn't obvious either, which was good, cause they could have so easily gone that way. andy lau should be banned from muscle suits. he's a rather attractive man, but not "bulked up". not as good as breaking news, but still an enjoyable film.  and that was the festival! i didn't go to day 18 cause i didn't book the tickets in time, and all the good movies sold out. silly me. in a couple of days i will post a summary where i will list my highlights, and also review all the short films i saw over the course of the past two weeks. but at the moment i'm up to my eyeballs in sewing with my costumes, and i'm stressing that i'm not gonna get it all done.

      i had planned to see about five films yesterday, but between costuming, and getting my haircut, i only managed to see one film. but oh what a film it was!   adventures of iron pussy  now c'mon, how can something with a title like that not be good? actually, it was good in that "so bad its good" way. it is the adventures of a thai transvestite crime fighter, that all of a sudden becomes a musical  a third of the way into the film. bad costumes, bad jokes, terrible subtitling (this would have to be the year of bad subtitiling.. did all the good subtitlers get better jobs or something?), it was just hilarious. a must see, especially for a drunken night with friends who have the same bad sense of humour as you do :P

       hotel  what a load of shit. this is most possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  in my life, and what makes it more annoying is that it had the potential to be rather good.  its a strange german film about a woman who gets a job at a hotel, where she also lives. the girl before her disappeared suddenly, and she becomes intrigued about why she left. this film is only 82 minutes long. if they added 30 mins of stuff that was actually interesting, this would be an alright movie. so many times you thought something was going to happen, and nothing didn't. i'm gonna tell you what happens cause i'm not spoiling anything, there's nothing to spoil. from the start, they set up an eerie atmosphere around a certain hallway that is so dark you cannot see the end. at one point there is a dream sequence where the woman walks down the hallway to find it leads out to the woods (which are behind the hotel), she then turns around and screams. thats it. nothing else. they could've shown the "lady of the woods" (this freaky doll thing which had some legend about a devil's cave in the woods which she haunts, and ppl disappear) attacking her or something, but no. when she finally does go down the hallway, what's there? oh just an end table. A FUCKING END TABLE!! why? why set that up for an hour and then give us a bullshit end table? in the end, she is locked out of the hotel when she is having a smoke outside, so she decides to walk through the woods (as you do at 11 at night). thats it. you assume she is killed. next shot is of a new girl applying for the job. the end. sure, if i wanted to analyse it, i could say that it was all the girl she worked with's fault, who killed her off, as well as the other girl before her, because they were liked more by the owner. but i don't want to analyse it. it was shit. end of story. do not, i repeat, do not waste your time with this film.   nine souls  this was a much anticipated film for me. i absolutely love the director's other film, blue spring (a great movie about japanese high school boys who compete for leadership of the other schoolkids), and had high hopes for this film. it didn't disappoint. the movie is about nine prison esacapees, their past lives, and their desire to fulfil their dreams. the little midget escapist, who was a doctor convicted for 'assisted suicide', was one of my favourite characters. having said that, all the characters were likable in one way or another. and i haven't laughed so loud in a cinema before seeing the ad for "tightest pussy" loan agency. great soundtrack too (blue spring also had a good soundtrack that i am still trying to get a hold of). i will definitely keep my eye on this guy for more great films. one of my highlights of the festival.

      seeing i got home at 3 this morning, there was no way i cbf posting day 10, so here they are together. actually was two great days of movies, which is always good.   day 10      doppelganger  i don't even know how to explain this film. made by the same director who did bright future, its abotu a guy who has a doppelganger (of course :P), who does everything he has always been to scared to do. the movie changes genres and moods every five seconds, but is very enjoyable. and the ending is very funny.  on a slightly related topic, this movie made me think about all those things i always wanted to do, but either have too great a conscience, or am just too weak and shy to do. i was also thinking about these things cause on  the way to the cinema, i saw my evil ex, and wanted to go and hit him, but didn't cause at the same time i was upset enough being on the opposite side of the road to  him, i didn't really want to be any closer to him.   switchblade romance  i will simply sum it up  the plot like this: french lesbians, lots of blood, circular saw. the film is kinda like a mix between the remake of texas chainsaw massacre and tenebrae.. in fact there are alot of visual elements in this film that reminded me of dario argento's work. my favourite part would have to be when one woman's throat is cut, and you see it open as she breathes.. that was awesome. oh, and a stick wrapped in barbed wire is the coolest makeshift weapon ever. originally titled haute tension (literally meaning high tension), i don't really know why they had to change the name to something so corny for international release. high tension was much more appropriate a title.. my friend and i were tense the whole film, and both jumped at a number of occasions.   battle royale 2: requiem  i have this film on dvd already, but i wanted to see it on the big screen. in my opinion, it looks better on the small screen. in some of the scenes, the camera work is so jolty that i had a massive headache trying to focus. the film is generally weak overall in comparison to the first battle royale film, but its worth it for riki takeuchi's performance as the teacher.    day 11      get up!  japanese men singing james brown... need i say more? ok i will. the main two actors were pigsy and sandy in monkey.. yes thats got you wanting to see this movie now, hasn't it? a very funny film about a yakuza boss who is going to jail in two days, and wants to see his estranged daughter, who happens to manage a group of impersonators. meanwhile, james brown is in japan, and he is a big fan. his friend decides to kidnap james for a private performance for his friend.  paths cross and hilarity ensues. lots of fun. a must watch.   a tale of two sisters  korean horror/thriller film that kinda goes well, then changes mood completely, and then confuses the audience while it tries to explain everything. i think i've seen too many of these films in the past two weeks (and i'm taking loki to see ring 1 &2 on thur for his b'day :P). i am now permanently scared of closets/ built in wardrobes, and asian women with long black hair over their faces and bony hands. there is some beautiful shots in this film tho, great use of colour. but the house is freaky, and so is the stepmum with her almost vertical eyes (and why are all her clothes made of satin? no one owns or wears that much satin, not even hookers!), and the ghosty thing with the red eyes and swinging arm. ok i'm gonna stop now cause i'm reminding myself of all the things that freaked me out, just when i'm about to go to bed...   men suddenly in black  fucking funny hk comedy movie that takes off gangster films.  a group of guys set out to get laid and party while their wives are away in thailand. the first half of this movie is the best, then it kinda stops being funny when the wives come back into the picture. worth a watch just for the "shootout" at the cyber cafe. ( the cyber cafe had these awesome giant paintings of anime girls in fan service shots.. they were soo coool)  and that was my craji 48 hours.. sooo tired, and my eyes are a tad sunken... i'm gonna make the most of my 7 1/2 hour sleep tonight!
