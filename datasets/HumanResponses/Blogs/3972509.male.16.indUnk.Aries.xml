      Maybe you've heard me talk about playing my new favorite game, Final Fantasy 11.&nbsp; FF11 is a role playing game set in a fantasy world (I feel like such a nerd, just typing that). The company that made the game puts out a newsletter with articles about what's going on around the imaginary&nbsp;world. I've been reading the back issues of it as i've played for the last few hours and I learned something: people are learning lessons in the game, even if they don't know it. There was an article about an actual event where a powerful monster appeared and a large group organized itself to work together until they beat their foe. It was a great lesson in teamwork and selflessness that i, myself,&nbsp;have had the oppourtunity to learn on a much smaller scale.&nbsp;   Another article was about the greatest in-game&nbsp;fears of random people interviewed in the world. The article ended concluding that even though the the experiences were scary, there was a great thrill in facing that fear, whether it was met with victory or defeat. Again, this was a lesson i had learned from the game.  Yet another article encouraged veteran players to help those just starting by giving examples of experiences that players have had.   Finally, the one that struck me most had to do with job-roles. In the game, players choose from one of about 15 jobs. Players join together in groups to kill monsters or accomplish missions. Their "jobs" determine&nbsp;their role in the game. For example, a Paladin has good defensive skills, so&nbsp;in a group, a&nbsp;Paladin would take most of the attacks. Black Mages' biggest strength is the ability to&nbsp;cast powerful spells to damage the enemy, so a black mage would stay back and cast spells. Those with the Thief job steal from monsters and attack from behind with special attacks to deal extra damage. As a final example, White Mages have the ability to cast healing spells.&nbsp; The job one chooses also affects one's attitude in the game. As a White Mage, one almost feels like one has a duty to help others. An example in one article was that a White Mage payed a lot of money to ride somewhere. When he heard someone call for help, he stopped his ride and gave up all that money to help someone he didnt even know.

      I can't get myself to go to bed at night. I usually end up going to bed at around 2, and starting the transition to&nbsp;bed at about midnight to one o'clock. Then, don't usually wake up until around noon. Today, i woke up somewhere between 11 and 11:30.&nbsp; I was happy that i didn't sleep as late as usual, but later i wasn't feeling well, so i laid down. I didn't get up for two hours. I woke up feeling fine. I guess i just had to sleep it off. Dad says that i probably felt bad because of all of the antibiotics being pumped into my system. He and i&nbsp;went to the doctor yesterday. He had some blood drawn to check for allergies, but i opted to just assume that i was allergic to the same things as him. The doctor prescribed some antibiotics for me and a nasal spray to clear up my nose. So far, it seems to work just fine. I can breathe through my nose,(which i havent been able to do for a month or two) but i'm still coughing. Hopefully, it will pass soon, for both of us.

       I guess i have to make an account to post comments and such. Well, it's me, Paul. I'm the brother of the recruits, Devon and Jon, and friend of the recruit Hannes. Aside from using this account to comment on the blog for their support, I guess I'll use this for announcements to the family such as getting my driver's liscence, how school is going, getting a job, etc.    &nbsp;  Speaking of which, Devon gave me his cell phone.&nbsp;This is another step in my growing up. Now that&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;cell phone, i can... be more responsible!&nbsp;You should call me at Dad's or Mom's house before you call that though. I'll probably be at home.    &nbsp;  So... don't mind the dark blog, it's easier on the eyes. Have you ever, left Word open and turned off all the lights? The white screen can light up a room.    &nbsp;  That's all from me, time to comment

      Howdy ya'll-    I did get a 2nd note from Devon today - telling me the first one "wasn't exactly from me, though it was "his" handwriting...  I had gathered as much  :>)  THis is where I am, I have 3 drill sgts, send mail to, don't send fedex, UPS...  nothing bigger than shoebox,  SATO info...     this little note that was not under instruction... says :  "boot camp is crazy as expected but a paradox ... a place you simultaneosly love and hate...  exactly what you expect yet still manages to shock you..."  He does say the DI's are very likeable... well that he likes them anyway and on that note... that they "are getting yelled at so I gotta go"  Anyway... all is well.. and now write away to them all at will as we have confirmed  Jonathan is indeed also in the same platoon.  Recruit Schaefle, Jonathan E 1st RTBN Delta Co  PLT 1002 MCRD  Sand Diego,  CA  92140  Fran

      3rd times a charm (I hope)  Either that, or I'll have to reboot as for some reason this is not posting anything but the title... anyway...  I rec'd a short note from Devon, w/ form letter from the CO -  and just talked to Philip - and Hannes and Dev are in the same platoon, figure that since they are on the buddy system it will be Jon's too -  this is what I have so far:  Recruit Colwell, Devon S 1st RTBN  Delta Co Plt 1002 MCRD San Diego, CA  92140  Recruit Botha,  Johannes L 1st RTBN Delta Co Plt 1002 MCRD  San Diego,  CA  92140  I will confirm Jonathan's and then post it too   Fran

      So according to schedule, they are participating in martial arts  today -  and they've been able to handle their rifles (notice I didn't say "play with!")..  I am sure they learned the inside out of their rifles - and are going to approach the end of week one of full corps training in exhaustion and exhilaration... one down... looking ahead... Week 2 Strength & Endurance Course Pugil Sticks I Bayonet Training First Aid classes  Marine Corps Martial Arts Program Core Values classes Academic classes  Physical Training Hope we get addresses soon!  Considering that the 20th of August they move to Camp Pendleton-  though their unit mail will follow them-  I believe it will be even more difficult for them to have time to write during the 2nd phase - that's field week (and I"m guessing a lot of desert training) and at the end of that the Crucible...  DId anybody else look ahead to the end of week 9...  the "Defensive driving series"?  ok ok... you know what I'm thinking right?  :>)  Its almost been 2 weeks guys!

      Well, strange things do occur-&nbsp; Mom is recovering well from breaking the top of her femur (hip area) 2 weeks ago... and now Dad is in the hospital having just undergone an appendectomy- My Dad was hospitalized for a week , six years ago, Mom.. well the last time overnight was when she had my baby sister (who is NOT a baby anymore eh Lois!)&nbsp; So... anyway... just think DevOn, if you weren't there sweating up a storm and getting "trained"... we'd send you down to Rossville to work their antique shop (which I will be doing for a few days next week I think) ....&nbsp; Prior to these surgeries of the past 2 weeks, the last surgery either of my parents had were tonsillectomies when they were CHILDREN!&nbsp; Thankfully, they have been pretty healthy - Dad did undergo a bout w/ prostate cancer last year, but it was treated successfully and he laughed and teased about how high his voice was getting (it wasn't really) after the hormone shots!   News related to our Marines...&nbsp; my cousin Marylynn wrote from San Diego and told me its cooled off there this week, last week it was in the 90's this week in the 80's so it should be better for the guys!&nbsp;   Fran

      Well - thanks to Elizabeth (Jon and Paul's aunt in NC)&nbsp; we have a site that informs us more about whats going on and when -&nbsp; and about a host hotel there  urlLink http://www.howardjohnsonsandiego.com/mcrd.htm &nbsp; lets you know what happens on family day, and on graduation...&nbsp;&nbsp;   SO.....&nbsp; we wait for addresses...&nbsp; and as I break a sweat at Curves...&nbsp; I think - man am I glad its them and NOT ME!&nbsp;&nbsp; My little 30 min circuit routine 3 times a week is rough enough!!&nbsp; I am excited to hear about the hard work, efforts, skills and training these guys are going through...&nbsp; how they are marching into the new roles and responsibilities... many that I can only imagine, some that I will choose NOT to imagine...&nbsp; I am thankful for their desire to serve this country, and to serve ...&nbsp; I think about the lives they will save, they will affect, the differences they will make... we each choose different paths and make a difference -&nbsp; but this action is sometimes bolder/broader and may be farther reaching -&nbsp; they may go to places we only hear about...&nbsp; provide support, protection, comfort to those we read about...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know, I sometimes think about the "harm's way"... but know that they will be trained, skilled in what they do, and that they have our prayers with them each day, now while they are training and growing stronger in skills and abilities, in understanding and endurance, and most certainly each day they are away in the years to come...&nbsp; as&nbsp; they move on in this chosen path...&nbsp; as Marines...&nbsp; I think also of Steven (Jon and Paul's cousin, who just recently finished Army boot and is in training)... these young men have chosen a path that offers intrigue to many of us, a little fear and apprehension for some of us...&nbsp; but one that will most certainly change forever who they are and what they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WE are thankful for their efforts, for their desire, and for the abilities they have and will use for us all.  (I know, DevON...&nbsp; 'there goes my Mom rattling on again..."&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; prolific are the words that tumble forth...&nbsp; whether from mouth or pen...&nbsp; well if not prolific.. then ok, they just tumble, but they are meant with love and pride in all of you!)

      Good Sunday Morning all-&nbsp; I had a nice visit w/ my Mom and daughter/grandkids and a friend of mine while I was down in central IL.&nbsp; Mom/Grandma has been moved to a continuing care center for 10 days to 3 weeks for the PT before she can go home.&nbsp; She is in good spirits.&nbsp;  Yesterday was a&nbsp;nice laid back Saturday, we'd looked at the log of the training, and knew the guys were well... starting into it.. all the lovely medical, dental, hair cuts, etc out of the way.... now on to "real" training...&nbsp; &nbsp;  We watched a couple of cooking shows on tv, and found a "new" addition to the way to prep a coating...&nbsp; and we were planning mahimahi (fish) for dinner...&nbsp; we started that, but alas... a close encounter with a knife resulted in a trip to ER (Edwards hospital has named a "Schaefle" wing)...&nbsp; Steve walked out 6 stitches later - not quite able to play the guitar this a.m. nor will he be able to go to baseball practice today... but by next week...&nbsp; :>)&nbsp; Believe we are going to invest in a pair of kitchen shears...&nbsp;   Ahhh Sunday morning... everyone up and almost ready to go...&nbsp; beep beep beep... the darn alarm is beeping again, its rather annoying...&nbsp; so I go and push a few buttons... uh... side note DO NOT PUSH TWO AT A TIME... I ended up sending out the emergency systems call ... and set off the alarm BIG TIME!&nbsp; (Yes laugh if you must... ) Had to call Steve, who was already at church to get the number to shut it off...&nbsp; OF course, I did get it shut off, however, not before the emergency systems were sent.. and thusly I got to greet the Medics, and then TWO of Napervilles finest as they showed up in their squad cars...&nbsp; (SORRY GUYS)...&nbsp;   It is a beautiful Sunny, gloriously wonderful day...&nbsp; temperatures that are so delightful any time of year, but especially in July...&nbsp; about 72 and low humidity... (I&nbsp; could live like this)&nbsp; you know within my range... 70-80 ... just perfect!&nbsp; I can go to 85 w/ low humidity (Do we hear Hawaii calling again?? )&nbsp; Hey guys, how about getting stationed at Kanehoe (its on Oahu)...&nbsp;  Happy first week of training guys... (hey did you guys see that the Crucible is in week 8!) Anybody get addresses from the guys&nbsp;let me know,&nbsp;I will post what I get here!&nbsp; Fran&nbsp;& Co. &nbsp;

      And back to work....&nbsp; I'm sure my work is less taxing then what the guys are doing today... wonder how they slept...&nbsp; Steve and I talked about that as we were drifting off last night...&nbsp; Fiarly sure that there wasn't a lot of restful sleep for the last night.. all that wonderful nervous anticipation!!&nbsp; Hey-&nbsp; I cooked dinner last night (for those who don't know, Steve does most of the cooking and is quite the chef...)&nbsp; but I did a "marv-a-lous" job w/ Italian Beef...&nbsp; lots of garlic and pepperoncini - not HOT ... just right (by my mouth- which means it was DevonDOable!)&nbsp;&nbsp; We sat at the kitchen dining table rather than the diningroom...&nbsp; Bridgett commented.... so, is this where we'll sit ALL the time now... nah... hey&nbsp;- guess we'll need visitors for dinner once in a while...&nbsp;&nbsp;we were down to 5 last night (practically unheard of at our house!) &nbsp;So girls give a call and we'll cook up something!  Going to Danville Friday to see how my Mom's recovering is coming along post op--  &nbsp; Ciao for now...

      Well its after 9 pm in CA, and it is most assuredly lights out&nbsp; !&nbsp; So any wagers on the wake up time, and how swiftly the trio jumps from bed.&nbsp; I did tease Devon that he would probably just try to just stay awake the entire time, since he just hates to get UP.&nbsp; Back to work tomorrow - then to Danville on Friday to visit my Mom and see how she's recovering from surgery...&nbsp; Got Kyle's haircut today, he commented that he coulda saved me $ and just let Jon's friends do it Sat. night - it is short, but not THAT short!&nbsp; Night all!&nbsp; Fran

      i received a letter from dev earlier in the week, and it included some very exciting news. i decided to type out a portion of the letter to share with everyone.  "i don't want to freak out over this, because it's a lonnng shot, but... apparently i have been selected and have made it though the first two primary screenings to be placed on special training for "presidential support," meaning that based on my MOS, after SOI and 1 year of fleet duty i would get 6 months of extra training and go to DC to guard the president's chambers in the white house. Apparently based on the qualifications i am a good candidate, but the chances that i get chosen are still pretty slim [...] ill know in another month and a half or so. [...] More later...Tell everyone i love them and will try to write them soon."  is that exciting news or what. Dev did not say if hannes or john were also chosen, so i don't have any information on those two guys.  i will let you know what is going on when new information arises.  hope everyone is well!

      God who?  A college professor, an avowed Atheist, was teaching his class. He shocked several of his students when he flatly stated he was going to prove there was no God.  Addressing the ceiling he shouted: "God, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you 15 minutes!"  The lecture room fell silent. You could have heard a pin fall. Ten minutes went by. Again he taunted God, saying, "Here I am, God. I'm still waiting."  His countdown got down to the last couple of minutes...  when a Marine just released from active duty and newly registered in the class walked up to the professor, hit him full force in the face, and sent him tumbling from his lofty platform.  The professor was out cold! At first, the students were shocked and babbled in confusion. The young Marine took a seat in the front row and sat silent. The class fell silent...waiting.  Eventually, the professor came to, shaken. He looked at the young Marine in the front row. When the professor regained his senses and could speak he asked: "What's the matter with you? Why did you do that?"  "God was busy. He sent me."  One Nation Under God  Guys head to Pendleton at the end of the week -  their Drill Inspection is I believe on Thursday... Its been busy up to now... and will just get busier for the next several weeks...  Kim called me tonight with an update from Jonathan -  he is doing good, has fallen on his head doing the obstacle course ('cuz if you mess up your hands and can't climb- rope burned and eaten I'm guessing... then you are delayed in graduation... so better to drop and try again... but 20 ft Jonathan???  Glad you have a hard head!)  She also said that they have talked to him about something to do with Presidential something or other duty... not sure of all the details...  it was good to hear from her w/ update.  Kim leaves for college in a couple of weeks.  Megs has had a a good couple three letters, and Paul rec'd one from Dev today...   Megs has taken a crew bowling tonight... her sis Molly, Bridgett, Paul and Kyle...  and I am off to bed... busy busy day manana...   semper fi!

      and tomorrow a manic MOnday  (OK so not everybody is too young to know the song ref!!)  ...  Philip - glad you are on the road to recovery - bummer that it'll be a while with still a few weeks of summer -  we will se eyou next Sat?  your Mom and Bill are having our troop (smaller now... alas) over :>)  Jen glad to know the date you're coming in , knew it was near end of Aug - it was a conversation at Brittany's birthday party yesterday -  Steve flew us down for it, so down and back in about 9 hours yesterday - She is getting to be such a big girl (my baby granddaughter)... We're all over the board today - getting my AUnt Mary (from San Diego) to central IL as she flew in and will visit w/ my folks - have another one of the young folks we support in missions doing a presentation this evening- he's been in Macedonia - and returns in another week or two  Getting kids ready for back to school...  B starting with babysitting again at church (so she'll have her own funds again!)  No additonal words from our troops -  though I do know from the short note of Dev's earlier this week that they are getting ready for the BIG Drill INspection - one that their DI's haven't lost in a LONG time.. so it's important for the to have everything shipshape, and to be doing their best performance etc (drill/march etc)  Pendleton is only a week away - which means the Crucible is 5 weeks away...  I am sure they have been quite busy this week.  I went in to the recruiter's this week and picked up some paperwork we needed to change Jonathan's phone (family plan, and its still activated -thusly if you see him on line - he's really not, just his phone hasn't been shut off!)  and talked to Sgt Rick - he's sending Dev the card - 4 marines in the office (yeah Jen (and Elizabeth!)  in uniform!)  They were chatty and talked about the guys and the training here, and there - interesting 10 min there!  Out the door to church -  Blessing for a good week to all!  Fran

The various news we have- Bridgett has rec'd a note from Devon and from Hannes this week, and I had a short note from Dev asking me to call Sgt Rick (their recruiter) and ask him to send his card, as Devon is supposed to give it to the senior DI there... and they are busy, tried, and have rec'd lots of letters and are thankful for them, even if they just have time to read them .. and don't get to the writing back part!  Devon had to have all 4 wisdom teeth pulled last week, and had some time away from PT due to that - while he ate jello and "studied".. ok and maybe that is when he wrote B's letter :>) ... Hannes was a short note to B, again stressing the busy, tired, got the mail hooray , and a reminder from Hannes to have Bridgett tell Steve to be careful of his fingers.. (stitches came out last week, and he was back to playing the guitar immediately!)  They will be having the Drill inspection this next week, a "big" deal from what I gather in a couple of the notes from Devon. Then next week(Friday), they head to Pendleton for 4 weeks training there - serious training and it ends with The Crucible...  We are in the planning and nearly purchasing stages of flights for October graduation and boot - I did send notes to all the guys suggesting that after Fri graduation everyone stick around for Saturday at the zoo - there will be family from all parts coming - Elizabeth (Aunt) and Bobbie (J &amp; P's Grandma) from NC, Jen (D's sis from well AZ currently, but by then she'll be making a transition to another hospital somewhere in the US... My Dad (who is recovering well)... Martie and Bill (?) and possibly Philip (Hannes' fam) Then there's the us' LInda and Michael, Kim (Jon's)... Steve, P, B, K, Me, and Megan... Haven't heard yet if Dev's dad (also a Kim) and Lisa will be coming, though Lisa teaches I think 1st grade, and October doesn't offer vacation at that time. I know Kim and Megan will be taking a few days off from college. We will be taking the kids out for a few days, and thankfully in the admin position I have there are vacation days I don't use up in any given year, so I can go even with school in session... And I don't think the kids will complain about missing a few days of school!  In the next hour, we have a guest coming and are hosting an open house for her. SHe has been with English Lang Institute in China. She will be showing a powerpoint of the year, and talking about her work. She is returning again next week to China to continue her work there. We have another young man from church leaving to go to China this week as well, he will be working with University students to share, and to teach English.  Heading down to Central IL again this weekend, as Brittany will be one year old (my youngest grandbaby). We are hoping to fly down on Saturday and return same day, as we are then transporting my aunt who is visiting (at a convention this week) up here back down that direction - so she can stay and visit w/ my Mom (and Dad) while they recover. She is from San Diego!  That is the news of the week.. that and registering Kyle for 5th grade = yet another new school for him... (and $162 later.. as he has band along with all the other fees...!) Bridgett next week. Only another 11 days and the kids are back to school.  Hasta... Fran

      Greetings all -  Back from Central IL where both of my folks are recovering well - up and moving - Dad with a little more ease than Mom- but both doing great -  colored and cut my mom's hair while I was there as she'll be another couple of weeks before she does anything more than go to the Dr - fixed meals, ran errands etc..  It was a good visit and I was glad I could be there -   Bridgett rec'd a letter-- from Jonathan - her's was the first letter he rec'd and he said he was so happy when his name was called for mail, and surprised that it was from her - it was a very touching letter - and a step up to the I'll be there for you big brother letter.  She was quite happy to hear from them, and to get a letter "addressed" to her!  They should have rec'd the envelope now w/ the addresses of family etc here, central IL and NC.  So they have the addresses and probably have rec'd letters from afar anyway.   WE took a little flight in the Cheetah to Benton Harbor... a beautilfu flying day - and very enjoyable... went to the 2 wineries close by and got a couple cases of the great wines from Contessa and Karma Vista.  Steve waxed poetic ... and should share some of that!  Off to church...  Guys start their Obstacle course and rope stuff I think on Monday.  Fran

      HI All -  we are all so thankful that Jonathan isn't having headaches -  sounds like the news we are getting is pretty much assuring us they are doing well.  Martie heard from Hannes again as well- and we rec'd another letter from Devon .  Devon has always been a writer... and I'm guessing since he requested everyone's addresses that he only has this one (and I hope Meg's) written down or memorized!  THey had earned an extra 15 minute writing time the other day for being "Awesome" in drill - there is a favorite DI, and it looks like they have a structure... good cop bad cop thing...    In 2 weeks they have their first "event"  (Initial Drill INspection) of which the 3 DI's they have  haven't lost it in a long time Dev says they get yelled at , but they also get a lot of praise.  He really finds rifle drill tough, but says it looks so awesome when you get it right.  OFf to visit my parents.. Dad comes home today from the appendectomy, and Mom has settled in well (both will be at my sister Margarets for recovery time)..  Fran

      Guess what Grandma got a short note from Jonathan today. Of course she still can't get on the blog so I am posting for her. Here comes the dictation... "training is going good, no headaches, food not too good, misplaced Aunt Lizz's address. Total letter sounds positive." end of dictation. Apparently I won't be receiving a letter until he receives the one I sent today. Love to all

      We've heard from a few of the recruits...  Steve rec'd a short note from Jonathan - and I had an email from Kim with news from the letter she rec'd from him as well -  apparently the guys had something like 6 shots- so imagine they are all a bit sore ... arms and uhhhh...   seems all is going well ... and they are tired.  Imagine so.  Last week at the family night church BBQ-  the Pearson's (a young couple- maybe early 30's) mentioned that they had both been captains in the marine corps -  (That's where they met), and would be interested in talking to the guys when they get back.  The also said if we had any questions we could give them a call .   They echoed the efforts, challenges and strengths the guys are obtaining now. Semper Fi
