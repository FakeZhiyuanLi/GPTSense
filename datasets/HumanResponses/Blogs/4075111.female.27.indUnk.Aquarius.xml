      So, yesterday I had to drive about an hour and a half to get new tires for my car. I guess my tires were not snow friendly. Luckily, because I hadn't put too many miles on my car Terry's stepdad was able to get me a deal on a trade-in for all-season tires. But, I had to drive to the backwoods of VT. This was my first outing by myself, leaving Burlington. OK, first of all I realize that once you get outside of Burlington you no longer use street names for directions. It gets too rural. Now, you use turn right at the blinking light or turn left at the big yellow farmhouse. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What the hell am I suppose to do with that. Is there only one blinking light in the town? Why yes there is, pretty much every town outside of Burlington is one of those towns that those of us in Cali only see in movies, one main road and only one stop light. Are you crapping me? Anyway, so these are the directions I got to get to the mechanic place. I have to give 'em credit though, I got there. So, then I decided to go for a walk in the town of Morrisville while my tires were getting changed and see what I could find. I found a dollar store, those can be fun. As I walked through town, I was looking around thinking I feel like I have a sign on my head that says I just moved here from LA. Talk about backwoods. I seriously, saw Billy Bob in the dollar store with only 3 teeth. From what I understand a lot of Vermont is like that, and that's cool. To each his own. Yesterday was just an eye opening experience for me.

      So, I have been here almost a month. Holy shit that's crazy. Things are definitely different. They are way cool though. Yesterday I had my first experience hearing Jim, terry's dad, talk on the phone. It is unbelievable that his dad will talk on the phone but, will not talk in person. It trips me out. I was there with terry's mom, jim's ex-wife. She is awesome. She is probably&nbsp;one of the few people who spend a significant amount of time with jim&nbsp;and she's his ex-wife. She has made me feel incredibly welcome and loved, already.&nbsp;&nbsp;

       I have been reading my best friend, Melissa's blog pretty regularly and it is pretty cool to be able to get a snippet of what is going on in her life. I really like it. I feel like I get to kind of keep updated on what is going on with her on a day to day basis.  
 So, I decided to set-up my own. This could be fun!

      It has been one of those days. Terry went to Chicago for the weekend and I am left here to contemplate life. What am i doing? Where am i suppose to be? Is this what I want to be doing? Is this where I am suppose to be? Is this what I am suppose to be doing? I seem to go through these periods where I question what is going on in my life. But, something very cool happened to make my day. I received a package from my nieces. It had a very creative note with some photos and they made me a "Build-a-Bear." That is where they went for Samantha's birthday last weekend. You can design your own stuffed animal. So, they made me a horse with a jogging suit on and they recorded a message on it so when I press its hoof it says "We love you tee!" Oh my gosh, that made my day! Thank you!

      The phish concert camping weekend was the top story in the Burlington Free Press for like the last week and a half. Yeah, not a lot going on in the old BVT. No, but seriously, I do have to give them a little credit. Those guys started here. They all went to the Univ. of Vermont and started playing at a local club here. So, for VT that is big. Next to Ben and Jerry's that is the most well known thing from VT. Oh, and by the way Ben and Jerry do not own it anymore, they sold out to a hugeass corporation, which makes me like them less even though that is the best damn ice cream. Sorry, tangent back to the topic at hand. The concert ground ended up being a disaster. It had rained so much here that the campgrounds were a muddy sludge. They started turning cars away because there was nowhere safe to park without your car getting stuck. But, the dedicated hippies still came. They parked up to 20 miles away and walked into the grounds. I would have bitched the whole weekend if we had went. We sat in our comfy bed and listened to the concert live on one of the local radio stations. Works for me. And the hippies are still here.

      OK- so, seriously, I feel like it has been raining for weeks. It has really been raining for at least 4 out of the 7 days/week. So, we get a couple of sunny days. THIS SUCKS! I don't particularly like the rain. Had I known I was moving to pseudo-seattle I may have put more thought into it. I would have come anyway, i love this guy too much. But, damn this rain is killing me. Oh, and it's the humid rain, where it is still hot as hell. My body is confused, jacket or tank top, jacket or tank top. Also, my mood gets affected by the weather. I start to get depressed and out of it. I wish it would just stay sunny, it is absolutely beautiful when it is sunny.

      Yesterday Terry's sister, Kate, and her baby, Myles and I went blueberry picking. I could be wrong but I don't think there are many places in CA that you can pick your own fresh berries. That was pretty cool. Now, I am going to make blueberry muffins, blueberry pancakes, blueberry turnovers, blueberry cobbler, blueberry pie, bluberry salad, blueberry salsa...you name it's gonna have blueberries. Thank god they are freezable.

      So, terry got tixs to the camping phish show/weekend, this weekend. He got them when they first went on sale. Then after, they announced they were breaking up and that is going to be their last show. HOLY HIPPIES, is all I can say. It is going to be out of control. It suppose to be on an old airstrip somewhere in northern VT in a town of like 2,000. They are predicting over something like 80, 000 people from all over and it is suppose to take something like 15 hours to get in and out of the place, oh, by the way we only live about 2-3 hours from there. Are shitting me? Way more effort that it is worth if you ask me. People are willing to pay lots of money for these tix. We have been trying to sell them but, first I fucked up and now we got screwed by the highest bidder on eBay. He won't answer our emails, that is so fucked up. So, it looks like we are going. Oh, and I think the hippies are going to be here for a while after. They are just kind of wanderers so they post up where ever they are for a while. I kind picture the weekend like Reggae on the River except way more people smelling like pachouli. I know it will be fun once we get there but getting there is going to suck. Maybe there is some extraordinary reason why we need to be there.

      So, I have decided that this whole working thing is a load of crap. I love working part time (or not at all). But, there seems to be one thing that keeps getting in my way...BILLS! You know, know matter how much you love your job some days are just going to suck because it's WORK. One thing I definitely, found out about myself in the last few recent months is that I need my balance of work and play or wittle phoenix is not a happy person.

       So, today I mowed the lawn. Don't ask me what got into me, but it was definitely a workout. It needed to be done and Terry didn't have time so I thought what the heck. I kind of wanted to know what it was like and prove to myself that I could do it. It's not just a man's job.  
 One thing though, I honestly, never thought I would mow the lawn in my lifetime. Two things I told Terry I would not do when I moved to VT: 1. Mow the lawn. 2. Shovel snow. Well, one down let's see how long I hold out on number two. I DO NOT WANT TO SHOVEL SNOW! Oh, and this whole winter thing is getting to be incredibly expensive and it is not even here yet. I had to get a new set of tires on Fri and luckily, I got a deal or they would have been $400. And snow clothes, NOT CHEAP. Oh well, here I am in the name of love.
