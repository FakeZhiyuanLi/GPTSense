      welpz.. my life until now.. imma write it here so i wont forget.. everyone says to just  'let it go... forget about it' .. well, i will let it go.. but i'll never forget. i dont mean it in a way that imma b angry, sad or upset about the whole thing 4ever. i'll let it go in a sense that, when i think about it all again, i wont feel the same anger as i do now... but the  whole  thing, the whole 5-6 months blessed me with so many precious memories i could never 4get. they were very special moments, i dont think i was ever as happy as i was wen everything was still cool bak then.. but thinking about those happier times still brings tears and makes my throat feel all funny... wat do u expect... i was  in love .. and i kno... everyone tells me.. your first is the hardest 2 get over. im not saying that im still hooked on the guy....  NO WAY IN HELL . ive moved on since then.. hehehe.. tell ya later =P  newaiiz... i'll start here (n imma make it real short coz.. man.. im already beginning 2 get that knot in throat feeling =[ ). it all started about september/octoberish last year. my "life" was beginning 2 unfold! hahahaha.. i was meeting new people, and becoming even closer 2 old friends. when the end of term 3 skool holz came, on the first monday outa skool, one of my closest chikas came over my house. the whole day was planned so i could meet her godbrother coz i became cool as bumchums wit him. welps i did meet him n he is one of d coolest mfos out der! hahahaha! he's d funniest! i cant really put names here so imma col him  "doctor" . well doctor knew ppl from his skool that lived around my area and on my street so we decided 2 go 2 their place. we knocked on the door... and it was  HIM .. he was the one who answered the door, but it wasnt his place. imma call him  "pimp" . then my chika sed "Oh thats pimp.. hes the one from the net.. the half filo one.." i thought to myself..   oh.. is that him.. nothing speacial.. i thought he was gonna b hotter hahahaha  (coz he's half.. n yeh.. =P). we sed hi n stuff but we didnt really get 2 talk to him coz they were 2 bz playing counter strike hehehe.  when the day was over doctor gave me the email addys of everyone i had met that day.. including pimp. so i started talking to him through the net first n yeh... i cant really remember how i got his number but i did =S... newaiiz i found out he liked my close friend so i was like full teasing him n all, but we became pretty close chumz coz i was trying 2 help him get her n stuff n i was trying 2 convince my chika 2 "choose" him hehehe.. it was the funniest coz pimp would tell me 2 tell her that she had nice legs n stuff!! hahahahaha!  talk about them 2 getting 2gether sorta died down a bit coz i think she liked sum1 else. me n pimp still talked 2 eachother every nyt about who knows wat bs!! and there were those occassional tymz wen i'd tease him about my chika still. sumtymz he'd drop by my house 4 a bit with his friends n we'd hang. this one tym wen he dropped by he was wearing a white hat, and a white shirt... n dayum he lookd really cute!! wen u see him more n more he sorta grows on u. the hols past and pimp became known as my 'homeboi' n i was his 'homegirl'. the idea of getting with him never occured 2 me. then, one friday afternoon at skool in period 6 while bludging in religion i was sitting next 2 my bestie danica coz it was her last day. she was going 2 europe on the weekend 4 the rest of the year. i was telling her about how i wanna like sum1 coz i havent felt that way in ages. she was asking about this guy that liked me at the time, and was suggesting that i shud like him. i began 2 give her reasons why i didnt like him n stuff... and out of nowhere... completely subconsciously... id alwaiiz compare him 2 pimp!! then... danica sed... "WAT ABOUT UR HOMEBOI!!" my eyes grew large and i was like NOOOO WAY! hahahaha...  the weekend came, and i actually started thinking about wat danica had sed about me n pimp. i think i liked him 4 a long tym b4 then, but i was just  in denial . on that saturday pimp came over with his friends again n we hung outside 4 a while. it was frikn funny! they bought hot chips n they were fukk throwing them on the road and theyd run over the chips with a bike so there were like potato mushy bits on the wheels. s2pid but amusing!! hehehehe. i had 2 go bak inside earlier coz i had 2 do my sisters hair coz she was going 2 an 18th. that night pimp slept over his friends house who lived near me so wen i called him they were all talking to me n yeh. well apparently they were playing "spin the brick". its like spin the bottle but instead they were using my friends brick of a fone. it was some savvy =P. pimp picked truth wen it came 2 him n his friends made him tell them who he liked.. and.. guess wat... he sed ME. so, nearly the whole tym id tease him about my friend wen i was the one he liked... funny isnt it... finding this out brought me 2 realise that i did like him... but i didnt say nefing yet. his friends were making me tell them hu i like. i wudnt say but it was pretty obvious.  on that week, on the tuesday night i fink, i was on the fone with pimp. by this tym we knew that we liked eachother. the conversation was sorta turning towards this issue. i was asking him how long he had liked me for, and why. he sed he liked me for a long long tym b4 then. as it got later into the night our conversation had become quite intimate. he was telling me that he was supposed 2 ask me out that night but he had  "butterflies in his tummy".  and then...  i will NEVER forget the way he sed it 2 me... pimp sed, for the first tym...  "gelli, i kno this might sound funny... but i think i love you..."  i was completely surprised n i was not expecting him 2 say that...! afterwards there was a short silence n he sed  "will u go out with me" .. i sed YES.. i dont think he cud believe it so he sed "nah im serious im asking u out..." n i replied, "i kno..so wat does this mean..hehehe?.." n he took a while 2 answer, he sed, "i think we're goin out!" n then we had a lugh after that.  the next day i found out that my friend had started going out with pimps friend!! hahaahhaa!! that was funny =P. we joked around n sed that they planned it out n stuff... but we knew it wasnt tru.  the next months were just like a dream.. i was the happiest person anyone could ever be. it was the best tym of my life. i got used 2 calling pimp my  boyfriend  coz it was a bit wierd at first. bak then he seemed like the perfect guy! he was everything u could want.... he was everything 2 me... we shared the sweetest moments 2gether. our first kiss.. i'll never forget. we were outside at the front of my house. we were saying our goodbyes n stuff. he leaned 2wards me n i thought he was cumn in for a hug, but his head kept on following mine n i was like..  wat the...  hahahaha! he was like "awww fine then!" n it was then that i realised wat he was trying 2 do!! then his lips touched mine =P it was just a peck... i must admit i didnt kno wat the hell i was doing coz i had never kissd ne1 b4.. but it was so gentle. u cud seriously feel the love... *sigh*  pimp was the sweetest guy i knew... he'd do the nicest things 4 me. sumtymz hed write me letters n stuff. wen we're out he'd alwaiiz look at me, stare at me and say im beautiful then giv me a kiss after... i could have seriously melted in his arms... we'd talk about the future n stuff, our lives n everything n we'd exchange "i love you's" all the time. he was soo kyooot. he'd play with my hair n stuff. he was soo gentle n i loved him more than anything in the world.. i would have taken a bullet for him. it was all like a dream and i never wanted 2 wake up... but.. unfortunately i did.... my dream quickly became a nightmare.  exactly 2 months ago, it was a monday night, i was sitting on my bed reading 'the outsider' for my english class. it was about 5 mins to 8. i was planning 2 col pimp as soon as 8 oclok hit (tyt ass tym 4 optus plan) coz i was missing my bubi, but wen 8 o'clok came i decided 2 finish the chapter i was on and then call him, which wudnt be in 2 long. wen i was coming 2 the end of the chapter my fone rang n it was my bestie danica on the fone. she asked me 2 col her fone n she didnt sound so happy so i was like "oh shit..." wen i called i asked her wat was wrong. the first thing she sed was, " i was talking to pimp on the net..."  my stomache turned as soon as i heard this coz i knew straight away that something was wrong. she began telling me about how pimp was telling her that he's been  'feeling different'  about me and our relationship, and then she sed that he started saying things like..  'we can still b really close friends'  and then danica was like   WHAT THE HELL..?!  n  she told him not 2 act on whatever he's feeling straight away coz things might change. but he sed something like   'it has 2 happen quickly'  . wen i heard all this my body went stiff, i cudnt move, i was completely speachless... i felt like someone had punched me hard in the gut and then stabbed me in the heart. i was so confused and i just wanted to kno why.  straight after i called him. the first tym i called it was bz... i knew he had no credit... i called agen straight after. he didnt kno that i knew already, but i told him and then we talkied about it all. not long after we started talking i was crying like a MOFO. the tears were just unstoppable. it all happened so fast. he was saying that "he still loves me" n he was making up all these  BULLSHIT REASONS   and was saying all this CRAP which now means  BULLSHIT  to me and alot of other ppl. i thought he wa being sincere and everything, i respected him and i let him kno how i felt. he sed that "his mum thinks we're getting 2 serious".. yeh right.. n that "he isnt allowed 2 stay up late on the fone nemore coz he's been in shit.."  MY ASS .... i was so upset, i was crying my eyes out. i respected him n let that pimp go. i still felt the same way about him as i did in the beginning. i loved him. and i  THOUGHT  he loved me 2...  i didnt get any sleep. i cudnt sleep. i was crying all night.. all those tears going 2 WASTE... at skool the next day no1 needed 2 ask me wat was wrong coz it was so obvious n i was still crying like a MOFO... i had been rubbing my eyes n crying so much that i had these red rashes around my eyes. i looked sik. i was sik. i was sik from a broken heart....  when i got home that arvo, and during that night... i found out  ALL THIS SHIT  about him n wat hes been up 2. pimp was talking 2 me on the net, acting all sweet n i was just thinking  FUCK YOU . i found out (hehehe from my "connections" bwahahaha) that he had been playing me.....    it hurt me so much.   now i was angry and upset. i had never felt like this b4. and thinking bak 2 it, i dont think i could ever go through all that pain n hurt again. its just 2 much..  well bak 2 the  PLAYING PIMP MOFO  (sorry im getting all workd up agen..) apparently he was at a party on the previous weekend. i was supposed 2 go 2 that party. if i had everything would be so different. well at that party he  GOT WITH ANOTHER GIRL ....!!! first i thought it was just hugging.. i was pissd... then just recently, i find out that all this  other   BULLSHIT  was going on at that party n frikn steam was cumn outta my ears!!!! arrrggghhh...  well im all worked up right now.. cant continue.. plus i gotta go church! quick quick...! mumz yelling at me..  i'll b bak =P hehehe laterzz
