						   Today is out 4 year anniversary from meeting each other! I can't believe that it has been that long. At times I feel like we just met, and at others, I feel like I have known her my whole life.  we kind of had a fight today. But you know, the problem isn't like a bad thing that you would think about, but rather it is two good intentions clashing.      Me, I am sick(a cold), but I don't want to complain that much and I want to stick it out, not be a baby. And I don't want Miyuki to think that way about me.      Now her, she wants to take care of me and worry about me. She doesn't want me to strain myself, and she wants to take care of me.      Her feelings are out of total love for me, and i suppose that mine are out of selfishness, and untrust. I mean that I'm not trusting that she will accept my real well-being, and that I think that she doesn't accept my feelings about it- like the feeling to complain about my situation.      So as a result, we are prone to argument. Like when I say I am fine but she knows I am not being honest. Or when I don't accept her trying to take care of me.      I am totally at fault. No part of my acting this way is beneficial to our relationship. If anything, it is a big hindrance. I should be more accepting of her love and her desire to take care of me. Because it is pure love. I know that she really cares about me.

						   today as i was looking across the croud at everyone, i again realized how lucky i was to have my wife. She is such a wonderful woman, and she is soo beautiful.  Latley I feel like i have lost all my confidence with singing. Like i totally suck, and i can't even hit the right notes anymore. But thanks to my lovely wife, i have been coerced to go to chior practice.  My lesson sucked so bad!!! I am the most boring teacher. Is it because I am teaching in Japanese? Is it becaues i don't prepare enough? Is it because i am just plain boring? It's like I'm putting everyone to sleep. Not only that but I feel like I am totally not getting the main point across. Like i'm just speaking in circles. No one is listening, and no one is learning anything. "well i guess this is good experience," is what I should say...  Well after the Choir practice i felt better about singing with other people in a small group, but even worse about my ability. well, the worst thing that i could do is give up and give in to my laziness.  xpatx

						   today she told me about her past relationships and breakups. she otld me that when she broke up with them, she never really told them the truth about why she wanted to break up, but that when she tried to break up with me, she always told me the truth about why.  she said that she had already decided to break up with them and that she jsut thought of a more diplomatic way to do it. so that it would be a clean break. no one wants to have a desater at the end. but i guess that is a matter of opinion. keeping the truth for them is a good method to sustain partial friendship or something, but you are sacrificing the truth. but that is our own choice.  this made me reallize that, with me, she did have those disputes toward me and had the feeling of breaking up, but the true desire to separate was never there. her saying that she wants to break up is just a way of sharing her feelings with me. yeah its a hard way to do it, but that is what works for her.   i am very glad that i could learn this. it helps me to understand my M more and more. that is my ultimate goal. to understand her completely, if that is posible.

						   you know i wish that i had all the time in the world to just sit and write all things that cross my mind, and to try to examine myself throught writen word. but unfortunaltly, i dont have that luxury. i have the luxury of only a few waking hours to even sit at the computer. but what is time?  something that i wish i had. so one of these days you will get a lot of cool things to read. if anyone is even reading this other than myself.

						   Today we had an unexpected argument.  &nbsp;  She came in with a loaded clip and one in the chamber. Me, I had a t-shirt(whatever that means).  &nbsp;   One important thing I learned today is:     it is imposible to argue with her when she thinks she is right, or that her oppinion is superior.    &nbsp;  speaking of her superior oppinions; she doen't really accept others oppinions at all. she just likes to hear herself talk about&nbsp; what she has to say.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   So today, the topic was:     Japanese grammar is much harder that English grammar so why did you say otherwise?     well i personally think that J grammar is easier. Yes it is true, there are more grammar structures but the basic conjugation is really simple and easy to remember. and the number of irregular verbs is a woppin   2!   as compared to the countless hoards in English. &nbsp; So this was the main thing. I tried to make her understand my point of view, but i really think that she doesn't want to even hear it. she just wants me to admit that i am wrong and that i am stupid for what i said............. even though its just and oppinion which i am rightfully entitled to have whether i am really right or wrong. &nbsp; well we stuborn humans like to have our oppinions and so i tried to argue my case (with the little speaking time given), but it was all for nothing. &nbsp; she turned it into the "You don't understand me" , "You don't understand what i am talking about" , "You aren't who i thought you were"   BULLSHIT   that she always pulls.... &nbsp; its driving me nuts.

						    Thoughts About The movie   i thought that the movie was really good. It seemed really realistic, and very plausible. We like to think that we will never see the consequences of our actions, that is why it is easy to say "it might happen in the next one hundred to one thousand years." I honestly believe that these things are very possible, and they will occur when we least expect it, in a way that we can't imagine.  This movie really convinced me that we need to protect the environment, and that we can do something about it. It is easy to think that we personally can't help, or don't effect anything. If all six billion of us individuals thought that way, we would have a serious problem. But on the other hand if we all work together, we can make a serious difference.  Living away from my mother country gives me a viewpoint on things that I would have otherwise not had. Here in Japan, we recycle all of our garbage. And now, as I look at America, which doesn't have a very developed recycling program, and does not try to comply with the rest of the worlds environmental standards, I feel really disappointed. America is a big and powerful nation. We should be the one leading other countries, not straggler or rebel.  I think that it's easy to have the "out of sight, out of mind" attitude. Especially America, being a large country. Smaller countries or island countries are somewhat forced to be more conscious about the environment because the result of their actions are very much in full view.  As for CO2 emitions, well, we have to look south to see our consequences.  At any rate, we are all being nurtured and sheltered by our common home, the Earth, which is why not one of us can think we don't have a responsibility, or that we can't make a difference.    Inspirations from the Movie    What is more important? What we leave behind, or how we lived our lives.   As I was thinking about the movie, I thought about all the people that were involved. There was a part where they had to burn books to stay alive. This made me think about lots of things. Yeah our lives are very important, and those books aren't- materialisticly speaking.  so i started to think about what was more important in our lives. The things that we have or the things that we do or the things that we leave behind.  recently, I saw troy and Achilles really wanted his name to go down in history and live throughout the ages, because he knew that in the long run his life really meant nothing. I would just expire and nothing would be left.  One of my favorite  urlLink Star Trek  Captains, Jean Luc Picard, said "The things we leave behind are not as important as how we've lived." (Star Trek Generations.)  I think that he is right. As long as we live a moral and right life, one that is just and true, then it doesn't matter what if our name is forgotten or that nothing from us is left behind.    urlLink The Day After Tomorrow

						   Lately me and my wife  have been doing the internet auction= Yahoo Japan, and she wants to start her own web journal= Rakuten Ichiba.  She often asks me for help, or for me to explain things. This is usually a good thing. It makes me happy to see her develop a hobby that is the same as mine. The bad thing is that she is not very nice about it lately. I will try to explain something and she doesn't understand, or she thinks I am not understanding what she really wants to know. That is understandable but she like is totally volitile. She gets pissed of so easly. She thinks that I am not being nice or that I am doing bad things on purpose..... Well I don't agree.  Yeah there will be some things that will take some time to understand, but is normal. I think that she wants too understand right away and it makes her angry when she doesn't.  Now the auction... I think that I don't ever want to do it again. The auction is in Japanese right, and she is obviously the native speaker, but I know what I am doing. She tries to take over with the e-mails back and forth between the people, and she makes it such a hastle to do. She thinks about what to say forever, and complains about what I say. So it really makes me not want to help her do it, cause she doesn't listen to me.  Anyway, I am very happy that she is interested in the computer though. I guess we will just have to work out our differences.

						   I learned at an early stage of our relationship that she is not very accepting of my past relationships. Yeah she doesn't like it. So I just stopped talking about it all in general. yeah i was kind of disappointed that she didn't want to kow about my past.  actually the most funny thing is that she talks about her x-boyfriends like they are her best friends. yeah she tells me about the cause i want to know it but you would think that she would get the clue and start letting me share too.  so recently i have spoken about them very breifly and she seemed totally fine with it and so today, i thought that i would talk about it. i asked her if she had had a simillar experience and stuff, then i told her about mine, and then she started to make fun of me and tell me how cheap i am. yeah. that did it for me. i have no desire to share those feelings with her or those experiences. its jsut a waste of energy.  you know i think that she thinks that these things still hold true to me know, and that things i did when i was in high school are me today. well that is totally obsurd. yeah, those experiences i had made me who i am today, but by all means they are not me, and i don't think they have any real value to share or even remember other than just to talk about the experience, or remenice or something.  oh well....  xpatx

						       You know lately, since I have been writing in my journal, I have felt like I understand what is going on with me and with my relationship with Miyuki. I am actually thinking about finishing my mission journals.      today I felt ugly. Really ugly. Not just appearance, but i think more on the lines of like my personal direction. All this time i felt like i had a kind of plan that i was intending to follow- and that was to go to dentistry school. And I am here in Japan and i think that I have reached the point where i have to seriously consider or reconsider my options.      last night, one of the things that we talked about, me and Miyuki, was about the future and where we were going to live. And well she being the only child, she has a certain responsibility to her family. Like to take care of them, and the the grave site after they die. So what i mean to say is that she would be sacrificing lots to go to American and leave her family. It wouldn't be so much of a sacrifice for her but it would be for her family. And her mother and father are totally willing to let her follow what ever path we want to take.      but you know, for me, i don't feel like she should have to sacrifice everything. And i know that she wants to do that for me, to a certain point, but i feel like she is really holding back and not telling me the whole truth about things. When we fight, she says that she is just following my dreams and that i never asked her if she wants to follow me and do those things with her. i thought that she didn't have a problem with it since she never said anything. Well i was wrong. i know that she has a very serious problem with it. i know that she wants to experience the life in America, but i don't think that she wants to live there for her whole life.      well, back to the point i was trying to make. So i am stuck with the decision of what to do. i don't know, but i do know that i need to explore more options here in Japan. i don't want to be an English teacher my whole life. If we do live here, then i seriously want a real career.      that is why i felt so ugly, because i felt like my direction was lost. Well it was lost from the beginning and it just got worse.      so i guess that i need to have a talk with my wife about what she really wants, and if she is willing to go or if she ants to stay.      but that will have to come after i reassures my options here in Japan.  xpatx

						       today was another one of those fight days. i went to work fuming and she stayed at home ablaze. yeah i was the cause of the fight(I dropped her wallet and her cell phone, because of my negligence, but she sure likes to make a bon fire out of smoldering ashes.      The day went as expected- bad, but I called her later and apologized. She did too, but little did I know, but that was only the eye in the storm.      I got home and she was making dinner, and I yet the cause of another fight.      Let me explain myself a litte bit before I continue. Since I got with her, I have had to choose my words very wisely because some things I say in jest, she takes seriously. She believes if you say a thing- especially a bad thing- you really mean it. That isn't true with me. I don't believe that. And if that holds true, then all the terrible things she has said to me and said that she didn't mean, she ment.      So lets get to the point. She was cutting vegtables, and she always asks me to help, especially the way she was cutting them- long and thin.      So I offered to do it. And she responded with a cute "why?" and that thought process that I spoke of starts up, I weighed the outcomes, and I stupidly chose to joke with her. I said "cause I'm faster." Now I don't really feel this way. Not at all. I just wanted to play around. So she took it seriously and it tured sour.      I don't want anyone to think that she is at fault. I am the one that started this. I am the one that didn't respect her feelings. And I said bad things to her. I started trying to explain to her that I didn't mean it, but she wouldn't accept that. Over the course of the fight, I came to realized that I did really disrespect her by what I said. She is the one that is working hard for me- making dinner, and I have no right to even poke fun at that. Even if I didn't mean it.      Well the fight progressed, well continued, and got changed into a totally different thing. That is the thing, when we fight, we always get off subject and end up fighting about a totally different thing. Usually past fights, my mother or the way we fight- like interupting each other, and stuff like that. The bad thing about this is that we never resolve anything. Maybe that's why we always fight about past things.      I really hate fighting with her. We both explode and things get worse and worse. I enjoy the calm but I love the times that we really enjoy talking to each other, and laugh, or sit in bed talking. I wish that it could always be that way. But we do have alot of things about ourselves that need smoothing out.  xpatx
