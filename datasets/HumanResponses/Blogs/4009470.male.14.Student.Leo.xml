       July 24, 2004   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Today is Games Day in Area 4 for NPCC. It is held at Guangyang Secondary School at Braddell. It is currently at a temporary holding site as the school is being rebuilt at site. It looks a lot like the old Rosyth!  :-)  Fortunately, it is raining quite badly and the activities start at around 10 am, so we spend a lot of time drawing buses and trains (lame!). No one from our school actually bothers to cheer (waste our breath) and we either play UNO, chess or talk incessantly.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the games, though not all games have been played, there is this prize-presentation ceremony. The girls seem to be leading all the cheers and rejoice and they shrill! Our school does not even bother to cheer as we are very   sian   and we are very humble (lolz) ... some schools shriek though getting third for soccer or carrom ... with of course the girls leading ... wonder why ...    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After today, I wonder why do they (the girls)&nbsp;have to shrill to show that their school has won something ... i remember one competition in which even RGS girls (i m not lying) also shrill when they won something!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonder if this is just been supportive and passionate for your school or just trying to be EXTRA and at the same time adding to noise pollution.    &nbsp;   WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION?

       31st July 2004            Today I decide to go for  NUS Junior Team Maths Training  (though I know that the stuff are still repeated) . Basically I am pissed off with  NPCC  as the stupid seniors called me up so late in the night ... so I see the prefect  Mister David Lu (or Loo)  wear a prefect blazier for the training when I am only wearing home clothes. I think he wants to show off to the  RGS girls  (not chio one!) that he is a prefect (a method of wooing perhaps). He claims that  he has to rush back to RI  later for the GEP Open House at 1.15pm.            It seems like  maths pro Yeong Li Qian  is unable to solve the maths problems today, perhaps he is too tired or bored to do them. Ronald Chan, our class 'koper', is so ks that he copies everything down and makes me very much worried. He always talk a lot of trash in class.           It seems like the SIMO people are tired of  curry puffs  (makes me want to puke by the way) and they now only serve packet drinks. It is not like we like to eat curry puffs.           By the way, next week is the  history drama finals  and I hope our school can win the championship ...      WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!

       Here is the extract of the essay written by Amanda Wei-Zhen Chong of Raffles Girls' Secondary and her essay won 1st prize for Class A. Hope you can enjoy it!    &nbsp;    What the Modern Woman Wants    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE old woman sat in the backseat of the magenta convertible as it careened down the highway, clutching tightly to the plastic bag on her lap, afraid it may be kidnapped by the wind. She was not used to such speed, with trembling hands she pulled the seatbelt tighter but was careful not to touch the patent leather seats with her callused fingers, her daughter had warned her not to dirty it, “Fingerprints show very clearly on white, Ma”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her daughter, Bee Choo, was driving and talking on her sleek silver mobile phone using big words the old woman could barely understand. “Finance” “Liquidation” “Assets” “Investments”… Her voice was crisp and important and had an unfamiliar lilt to it. Her Bee Choo sounded like one of those foreign girls on television. She was speaking in an American accent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old lady clucked her tongue in disapproval. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I absolutely cannot have this. We have to sell!” Her daughter exclaimed agitatedly as she stepped on the accelerator; her perfectly manicured fingernails gripping onto the steering wheel in irritation. &nbsp;&nbsp; “I can't DEAL with this anymore!" she yelled as she clicked the phone shut and hurled it angrily toward the backseat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mobile phone hit the old woman on the forehead and nestled soundlessly into her lap. She calmly picked it up and handed it to her daughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, Ma” she said losing the American pretense and switching to Mandarin. “I have a big client in America. There have been a lot of problems.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old lady nodded knowingly. Her daughter was big and important. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bee Choo stared at her mother from the rear view window, wondering what she was thinking. Her mother’s wrinkled countenance always carried the same cryptic look. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone began to ring again, an artificially cheerful digital tune, which broke the awkward silence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Hello Beatrice! Yes, this is Elaine.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaine. The old woman cringed. I didn’t name her Elaine. She remembered her daughter telling her, how an English name was very important for “networking”, Chinese ones being easily forgotten. &nbsp;&nbsp; “Oh no, I can't see you for lunch today. I have to take the ancient relic to the temple for her weird daily prayer ritual.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Relic. The old woman understood perfectly it was referring to her. Her daughter always assumed that her mother’s silence meant she did not comprehend.  &nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, I know! My car seats will be reeking of joss sticks!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman pursed her lips tightly, her hands gripping her plastic bag in defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The car curved smoothly into the temple courtyard. It looked almost garish next to the dull sheen of the ageing temple’s roof. The old woman got out of the back seat, and made her unhurried way to the main hall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her daughter stepped out of the car in her business suit and stilettos and reapplied her lipstick as she made her brisk way to her mother's side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ma, I'll wait outside. I have an important phone call to make,” she said, not bothering to hide her disgust at the pungent fumes of incense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old lady hobbled into the temple hall and lit a joss stick, she knelt down solemnly and whispered her now familiar daily prayer to the Gods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you God of the Sky, you have given my daughter luck all these years. Everything I prayed for, you have given her. She has everything a young woman in this world could possibly want. She has a big house with a swimming pool, a maid to help her, as she is too clumsy to sew or cook. Her love life has been blessed; she is engaged to a rich and handsome angmoh   [1]    man. Her company is now the top financial firm and even men listen to what she says. She lives the perfect life. You have given her everything except happiness. I ask that the gods be merciful to her even if she has lost her roots while reaping the harvest of success. What you see is not true, she is a filial daughter to me. She gives me a room in her big house and provides well for me. She is rude to me only because I affect her happiness. A young woman does not want to be hindered by her old mother. It is my fault. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old lady prayed so hard that tears welled up in her eyes. Finally, with her head bowed in reverence she planted the half burnt joss stick into an urn of smoldering ashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bowed once more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman had been praying for her daughter for thirty-two years. When her stomach was round like a melon, she came to the temple and prayed that it was a son. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the time was ripe and the baby slipped out of her womb, bawling and adorable with fat thighs and pink cheeks, but unmistakably a girl. Her husband had kicked and punched her for producing a useless baby who could not work or carry the family name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the woman returned to the temple with her new-born girl tried to her waist in a sarong and prayed that her daughter would grow up and have everything she ever wanted. Her husband left her and she prayed that her daughter would never have to depend on a man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She prayed every day that her daughter would be a great woman, the woman that she, meek and uneducated, could never become. A woman with nengkan; the ability to do anything she set her mind to. A woman who commanded respect in the hearts of men. When she opened her mouth to speak, precious pearls would fall out and men would listen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She will not be like me, the woman prayed as she watched her daughter grow up and drift away from her, speaking a language she scarcely understood. She watched her daughter transform from a quiet girl, to one who openly defied her, calling her laotu; old-fashioned. She wanted her mother to be “modern”, a word so new there was no Chinese word for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now her daughter was too clever for her and the old woman wondered why she had prayed like that. The gods had been faithful to her persistent prayer, but the wealth and success that poured forth so richly had buried the girl’s roots and now she stood, faceless, with no identity, bound to the soil of her ancestors by only a string of origami banknotes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter had forgotten her mother's values. Her wants were so ephemeral; that of a modern woman. Power, Wealth, access to the best fashion boutiques, and yet her daughter had not found true happiness. The old woman knew that you could find happiness with much less. When her daughter left the earth everything she had would count for nothing. People would look to her legacy and say that she was a great woman, but she would be forgotten once the wind blows over, like the ashes of burnt paper convertibles and mansions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman wished she could go back and erase all her big hopes and prayers for her daughter; now she had only one want: That her daughter be happy.  She looked out of the temple gate. She saw her daughter speaking on the phone, her brow furrowed with anger and worry. Being at the top is not good, the woman thought, there is only one way to go form there – down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman carefully unfolded the plastic bag and spread out a packet of beehoon   [2]    in front of the altar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her daughter often mocked her for worshipping porcelain Gods. How could she pray to them so faithfully and expect pieces of ceramic to fly to her aid? But her daughter had her own gods too, idols of wealth, success and power that she was enslaved to and worshipped everyday of her life Everyday was a quest for the idols, and the idols she worshipped counted for nothing in eternity. All the wants her daughter had would slowly suck the life out of her and leave her, an empty soulless shell at the altar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old lady watched her joss tick. The dull heat had left a teetering grey stem that was on the danger of collapsing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modern woman nowadays, the old lady sighed in resignation, as she bowed to the east one final time to end her ritual. Modern woman nowadays want so much that they lose their souls and wonder why they cannot find it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her joss stick disintegrated into a soft grey powder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She met her daughter outside the temple, the same look of worry and frustration was etched on her daughter’s face. An empty expression, as if she was plowing through the soil of her wants looking for the one thing that would sow the seeds of happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climbed into the convertible in silence and her daughter drove along the highway, this time not as fast as she had done before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Ma,” Bee Choo finally said. “I don't know how to put this. Mark and I have been talking about it and we plan to move out of the big house. The property market is good now, and we managed to a buyer willing to pay seven million for it. We decided we’d prefer a cosier penthouse apartment instead. We found a perfect one in Orchard Road. Once we move in to out apartment we plan to get rid of the maid, so we can have more space to ourselves…” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old woman nodded knowingly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bee Choo swallowed hard. “We'd get someone to come in to do the housework and we can eat out…but once the maid is gone, there won’t be anyone to look after you. You will be awfully lonely at home and besides that the apartment is rather small. There won't be space. We thought about it for a long time, and we decided the best thing for you is if you moved to a Home. There’s one near Hougang, it's a Christian home, a very nice one.” The old woman did not raise an eyebrow. &nbsp;&nbsp; “I've been there, the matron is willing to take you in. It's beautiful with gardens and lots of old people to keep you company! I hardly have time for you, you'd be happier there.” &nbsp;&nbsp; “You'd be happier there, really.” Her daughter repeated as if to affirm herself.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time the old woman had no plastic bag of food offerings to cling tightly to; she bit her lip and fastened her seat belt, as if it would protect her from a daughter who did not want her anymore. She sunk deep into the leather seat, letting her shoulders sag, and her fingers trace the white seat. &nbsp;&nbsp; “Ma?” her daughter asked, searching the rear view window for her mother. “Is everything okay?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What had to be done, had to be done. “Yes” she said firmly, louder than she intended. “if it will make you happy,” she added more quietly. &nbsp;&nbsp; “It's for you Ma! You’ll be happier there. You can move there tomorrow, I already got the maid to pack your things.” Elaine said triumphantly, mentally ticking yet another item off her agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp; “I knew everything would be fine.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elaine smiled widely; she felt liberated. Perhaps getting rid of her mother would make her happier. She had thought about it. It seemed the only hindrance in her pursuit of happiness. She was happy now. She had everything a modern woman ever wanted; Money, Status, Career, Love, Power and now, Freedom, without her mother and her old-fashioned ways to weigh her down… Yes, she was free. Her phone buzzed urgently, she picked it up and read the message, still beaming from ear to ear. “Stocks 10% increase!” Yes, things were definitely beginning to look up for her… &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while searching for the meaning of life in the luminance of her hand phone screen, the old woman in the backseat became invisible, and she did not see the tears.

       28th July 2004:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For Character and Leadership Education lesson, or CLE, we have classes 2A, 2B, 2C, 2J and 2K presenting their skits based on a topic related to CLE and life&nbsp; (such as cheating in class, loneliness) . We are all adjourned to the atrium&nbsp;which&nbsp;is quite packed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First up is&nbsp; class 2A  in which we  don't even know  what the  heck  they are saying. They do not&nbsp;bother to speak into the mike and what we see&nbsp;are&nbsp;four people beating up a person in class and in the&nbsp;toilet ...  (lolz). &nbsp;Everybody cheers as we see the poor guy been bashed up and has his shirt pulled out and his genitals bashed ... ( oops! ) Also, none of the teacher can understand what is really happening.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best (or most daring) skit is put up by class 2C in which we see a guy posing as  Aisha  (the Malay&nbsp;lady working with Sharon Xu) and another guy wearing a dress with  enhanced bosom using pear shaped balloons ! It is quite funny watching these two people working up and down and fighting to bring out the theme of racism and prejudice.  Chen Yuan Kang , a guy from 2K, comments that they should not have gotten to such extent even if there is a need to play the role of a girl but they  receive a standing ovation  at the beginning and the end of the play.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, this reminds me of plays during Shakespearean times in which women could not perform in plays at all as they will be looked down or considered to have low social status if they perform (sad right). Hence, male&nbsp;actors will have to change costumes when necessary to act as women...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ho Wen Jun's  acting skills really rock as he acts as a  kiasu middle-aged woman  coaching her son and making him do tons and tons of assessment books.   His etiquette and movements really resembles to that of a woman. He is really a born actor ...  Go Wen Jun, go!     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for our class, we most likely will be performing next week and hopefully it is enjoyable. The topic is "Unrealistic expectations of parents and teachers".    WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION?

       27 July 2004:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Today, we have Zi Guang battling out with some other guys (including me) in a modified version of  carrom , where you get to hit your opponent's piece out of the table... He claims that he is not as pro in this game as a few years back in primary school  (Juanhe  , can you confirm this  ?)     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Selvan (that's our English + Literature teacher by the way - you can call her Junki or Selmo if u like! ;-o) teaches us that you can love someone with all your  LIVER  ... which means I can be liverbroken   (so sad)   ... won't I be dead by then since the liver is one of the most important organ in the body?    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The science is the most boring lesson ever ... the relief teacher (fifth one this year) speaks so softly that he is barely audible and no one can understand what he is teaching ... i think he will overtake Aymie Lim (geog. teacher) as Word + PowerPoint king ...

       5th August 2004:   Today we have  no lessons  but English Feste! To start off, we have a  dramatisation  making use of fairy tale characters and events in a surprise setting and props. For our class, we have to do on the characters Cinderella   by Norman Lim  , Rumpelstiltskin   by Yi Jing  , Baby Bear   by Bowen  , Goldilocks   by Mervyn Chng  , the Prince of Morocco   by Daryl Eng   and the Fairy Godmother   by Paul Ng   in the surprise setting on the mountaintop. We are given 45 minutes to write out the plot and dramatise and this is the storyline:        Once upon a time, in a land far far away,  Cinderella  married the  Prince of Morocco  in a royal wedding. Then,  Cinderella  realised that the  Prince of Morocco  was impotent. The  Prince of Morocco  said that if she did not spin a straw into gold, she will be banished from his country.  Cinderella  met  Goldilocks  and  Goldilocks  remarked, " Cinderella , you are so pretty and sexy!"  Cinderella  replied, "You are also sexy and chio too!" Hence, these two became very good playmates.      Then,  Cinderella  went to the mountaintop hoping to spin the straw into gold and return to her husband. When she climbed up, she commented, "I know the folks down there will want to see my underwear, so I didn't wear any!" Upon reaching the mountaintop, she met  Rumpelstiltskin  and they also fell in love with each other. As she tried spinning the straw into gold, the  Fairy Godmother  appeared.  Cinderella  wanted the  Fairy Godmother  to grant her wish and in the blink of an eye, the straw turned into gold!       At the same time, the  Fairy Godmother  got a crush on  Rumpelstiltskin  and seduced him! Since  Cinderella's  dream was fulfilled, she came back to her husband and they lived ever after.       How about  Goldilocks ? Yes, she met  Baby Bear  and  Baby Bear  said, "Were you the one who slept in my bed?" She replied yes and got married, and lived happily ever after.      Okay, after this, we have a round of Scrabble in which I am so lucky to place all seven tiles onto the board and score 81 points! ( HAHA !) I and some other classmates (pardon the grammar) watch Shakespeare in Love which is quite touching and how his love life inspired him to compose Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. It is an enjoyable day today!!!          WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION? DO COMMENT AND REPLY TO THIS POST!   COPYRIGHT © 2004 LEVIATHAN DREAMERS    ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

       4th August 2004          Today, we have inter-house  cross-country  competition at MacRitchie Reservoir Park which is a 4.8 kilometre run. For me, I have to be a  road marshal  and together with Guo Cong, Shan Hui, Mark Yeow and Kian Wee, we stand at a spot for  about 1.5 hours  seeing people run past us rather than doing our duty (slack rite?). By the way, I think the runners know where to run and we are just  some statues  breaking the monotony of the blanket of green in the park. We break the boredom by playing a game called " The Three Word Game ", in which one person will continue the story using only three words (punctuation marks not counted)           For example:              I see two ...              You can continue the story by adding three words, for example, "boys walking down", "chio bu talking" and so on ... until you will get a very lame, stupid story. It can be sexist, racist, vulgar, porn etc. as long as you use three words to continue the story. Here's one example (the different colours represent different people writing:                I see two   chio bu doing   tai chi in   a really noobish   manner ...            So we spend one hour on an essay something similar to this. We also cheer for classmates Norman and Yi Jing as they zoom past us in the top five positions.  It is glad to hear that they end up second and third respectively and the top three runners for Sec 2 category are from my house!!! This shows that our house stands a good chance as the overall champion house for this year...            At the end of this job, our heels get so tired that our legs feel like breaking and we seriously need to drink and rest. Basically it is kind of pathetic to watch people run and wearing half-uniform with a beret under the hot sun ... and the seniors (thanks to Choo Yee Sin) say that the  milo is not for us when it is open for all ...
