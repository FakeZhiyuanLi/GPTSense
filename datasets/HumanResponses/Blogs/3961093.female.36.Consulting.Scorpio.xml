       Walking home from seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 for the second time, I realized that I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something for the troops who are serving our country and risking their lives for the people of Iraq.&nbsp; After seeing the movie again, it finally sunk in that I can either take my rage over Bush out on all of my friends and family by forcing them to listen to my views, or I can do something that actually might set an example and require personal effort. If all we do as frustrated Americans is sit around the kitchen table debating the subject, or watching endless commentary on Meet the Press, we are as passive as we were when Bush snuck in the White House and fooled us into believing that Iraq was behind 9/11.    &nbsp;  So, I began to do some research............and I decided that my contribution would have to show support of our troops, while not misleading anyone that I oppose the war.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions if you would like to join me in supporting the troops, objecting to the war, or both:   &nbsp;    Send Books to Our Troops    If you would like to send books to soldiers yourself, check out&nbsp; urlLink www.booksforsoldier.com  where soldiers will post requests for books they'd like to get their hands on and all you have to do is pick a soldier to send a book to.  &nbsp;    Register 10 People to Vote This Summer   You can get voter registration forms at most city and county clerks offices and most DMVs and Secretary of State offices. Pick them up today and carry them on you. Begin asking everyone you know (or don't know!) if they are registered. If they're not, register them on the spot and send their registration card in (be sure to follow all state regulations; e.g. some states require that you have to live in the same county that you are registering someone in). RocktheVote.com can provide you with the  urlLink regulations for each state  and can also set you up with all the tools you need if you want to do a  urlLink larger voter registration drive  of your own.  Remember some people are afraid to register, often because they don't want to be called up for  jury duty  like my mom has been asked to give up part of her summer for. Remind them that juries are now called from the driver's license lists. Think of creative ways to sign people up. Grab them coming out of "Fahrenheit 9/11"!     Registering to Be a Conscientious Objector    Unfortunately, the United States Military does not allow private citizens to register for Conscientious Objector (CO) status until a draft is called. However, you can record your desire for CO status by sending a letter stating the beliefs (be they spiritual, religious or personal) or life experiences that would preclude you from serving in the military, to the offices of Selective Services (check  urlLink www.sss.gov  for appropriate office).  If you or someone you know currently is serving in the military and is looking for a way out due to conscientious objections, the Center on Conscience &amp; War can help provide all the answers and information. If you have any questions or concerns about obtaining CO status, contact:   The Center on Conscience &amp; War (800-379-2679,  urlLink www.nisbco.org ) and a representative will talk you through the process.  GI Rights (800-394-9544,  urlLink http://girights.objector.org ) who provide information to servicemembers about military discharges, grievance and complaint procedures, and other civil rights.   If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me, or respond to this Blog.&nbsp;

      Last night I talked to Steven Jr. about his trip to Chicago in two weeks. He works nights so the only time we can really chit-chat is on the weekends. Our conversations span the spectrum of current events and basically it is like I am taking to someone I've known all my life.  This time though the conversation veered towards something that happened in the late 1990's. Apparently Steve's roofing business was very successful and he was spending a lot of time and money at the stripclubs. Lonely and depressed, he bought the strippers gifts, gave them money. There was one he really liked and Steven said he even bought her a Camero. He thought they might end up getting engaged but then one day Steve told him that the stripper had been found stabbed to death in the car. Steven explained it to me like it was nothing.....that he heard that she had a  stalker  or something.  A little spooky? Probably the only other person who knows the depths that Steve went through to stalk me is Mary Beth. How I ever got so lucky for him to give up, I don't know. Keep in mind this is also a man who habitually lies and twice burned down his house for insurance money.  Do you think he could have killed her? Maybe he followed her and found out she had a few other sugar daddies? It's just a little too creepy for me. I am going to try to get more info out of Steven -- what her name was, etc. Hopefully somebody cared about her enough to mention that she had been seeing someone with a shady past.
