        Today wasn't quite as interesting as yesterday. Today was basically a packing day for my big trip to Idaho!!! Yeah baby I'm so excited! It's going to be six long hours of heat exhaustion though in the back of our Ford truck, which is where I get to ride. It's hot enough towards the east of the mountains without the whole canopy no fresh air factor.....ahh!   Anyways, I bought two new CD's today, Nickelback "The Long Road" and Toby Keith "Shock Ya'll." Need some new music for my long journey!!! Woo hoo!   I also went to the store today to find a bottom to my bathing suit...hadn't had much luck until today where I found THE perfect one!!!!! Yeah! It's red and has flowers and is SO cute! I'm so excited! I just need to tone down a bit physical wise so I don't look so....cough....okay that's enough of that lol maybe if I get a tan it will look better. Oh well, I'll find out.   Well I'm not going to be able to write for awhile since I will be gone 'til Monday I think...Yay! I'll fill in how much fun the trip was when I get back! Buh Bye!

        Today was the freakiest day of my life...I never thought ex boyfriends could be so freaking scary!!!!!!!!!!   Me and Murray were comin' home from Blockbuster after renting Calendar Girls (stupid) and Along Came Polly (not Murray's cup of tea). We go around the corner onto the street by Buds and Blooms and BOOM there's Eric in his stupid red jeep. Ali and I were freakin out so I was trying to follow her high pitched squeaky directions to go "there" "no there" "turn there."   The "turn there" happened to be an enclosed parking lot with only one freakin exit, which Eric parked his sorry butt. So then we were stuck, everytime I tried to get out, he'd move closer and closer to my baby 67 Mustang's bumper, making me more and more pissed every second.   Then I got so pissed that I just got out of the car ready to haul some butt and he backs up and away... I think "yay I won" but as soon as my tush hits the leather of my car, BOOM he's back again in my face.    That is when God bestowed a miracle for us. THere was a tiny Asian woman in the parking lot who shook her fist at the jerk and told him to leave us alone...I think, I couldn't quite understand what language she was tryin to say, but it worked (for the moment). We were able to exit the area but he was still on my butt. We drive around trying to figure out how to get away. So then Alison goes and she throws a stupid after dinner mint at his hood. This pisses him off so he pulls around us and does a U turn in front of us, speeding toward us, almost sending us careening in a ditch, which is where my brakes got good use of. The result was whiplash and all the crap in my back seat to fly at our heads and under the seats, creating a mess that was inexcuseable!!!!!!!!!Jerk.....   That wasn't the end of it. Then the jerk drives off and yells "no one throws things at my car!" like he should even be possesive over his crappy jeep cherokee that is going to die soon knowing his driving skills. UGH!   Then we were done, he was gone. Ali and I go for a walk and I get 10 or 15 somethin calls from him (didn't answer a single one...who honestly would wanna talk to that) and ugh it's just a big old mess. Dating sucks....It always ends up with broken hearts and future stalkers..that's all I gotta say for today so I'm going to go before I burst! G'night all!

        Hey Hey Hey! Today was interesting...I went to my brother's house up in Des Moines, where I had fun in their pool. I pushed him in and he got me back good by jumpin out and throwin me in. Keep in mind that this is only a five foot pool so I am surprised I didn't crack my head open....Him either for that matter with all the dives he tried....psycho!!!!   We also played YATZEE for like 3 hours...wow that game never gets dull....sad. Also for all you that don't know my brother, he may be twenty eight years old, but he's got the mind of a twelve year old, as do I by means of how we act around each other (total idiots). Lol...guess you have to see us together to get it..Oh wellz.   Last night was my parent's anniversary and they got woke up three different times by three anonymous callers...interesting...there was also a truck that kept drivin past my house extremely slow...wonder who that coulda been.....   Oh! I saw White Chicks today and it was FREAKIN HILARIOUS! Whoever told me that it would be a waste of money was CRAZY because I LOVED IT!!!! It was great, but I also have a warped sense of humor...actually, here's how it works:   My mother has a warped sense of humor...my dad has a witty sense of humor, and me being around both...the result is, well I am just pretty much screwed up, but as Skinny B said the other day I'm simpy "Unique" and that I am! =P    Well it's a Hot Hot Hot day out today and I have to go get some color before I go to Coure D' Alene (however you spell that dang lake's name) that's in Idaho. I'm gonna go waterskiin!!!! Yeah baby! One ski of course, and maybe I'll be able to figure out how to one ski getting up and not have to drop the second ski...that would be just plain awesome...yes! Well I'm gonna go now and try to get a tan....not holding my breath of course on that one lol jp buh byez!

       Wow...Skinny B got me interested in this thing, so now I made one...Isn't that facinating? Lol Oh well..So far summer is going SLOW!!!! I saw two movies though which is great.   The Notebook with Alison M was awesome! So sad, with a crappy ending lol old people kissing is not what you want the last image in your mind to be after a romantic love story.....ewwwww.....   The other movie I saw was Dodgeball with Schraum Dog...Very interesting to say the least. But not only did I go see that but I drove to Auburn the first time alone and LEGAL with a passenger since today my sixth months are officially UP!! WOO!!!!!! I'm so excited...and I just can't hide it...I know I know I know...okay that was stupid...   Moving on....  Lol.    Well anyways...I'm crazy just to inform those that didn't already know....Just for your information. Yet, most of you know that as you will through this Blog thingy...hehe have fun getting to know me and my fabulousness...despite that being a word lacked in the dictionary....oh well!!!!

      Today I woke up at 7 a.m. and was TIRED and could NOT get back to bed if my life depended on it. Soooo I mucked around for awhile, mom made me go do the grocery shopping at Safeway which involved using a cart. I hate those things, they're so difficult. Lol. Got the groceries, mosied on over to the BECU to take out some cash...15 dollars added to my current 7, which came in handy later. Lol. I go and pick up Brian and was thankful I brought my sunglasses. He's sure lookin good with his hardware off...very nice lol. About got blinded by 'em. Lol. We drive on over to the mall, and go directly to the food court. Brian gets pizza and seafood and I get chicken and rice. The chicken is SO good at the Cajun Grill...Yummy! Then we walk around a bit, go into the record store, Pac Sun, tried to pull him into the lingerie store. He didn't wanna go lol and started complaining that the mannaquins were made of plastic and not flesh...guy for ya lol. I tried to find him a girlfriend in the mall, but the ones I picked out for him he didn't approve of....lol. Hehe I'm so mean. Then we get to the sports store and he needs to pick up some dumbells...he figured they'd be like 20 bucks...rings it up and it was $45!!!!!!!! In the end, I helped him and we were searchin our pockets for small change to get up to $45. Lol. It was great. Then we walked back to the car which was on the other side of the mall, him with one of the 30's and me with another, which started getting heavy after awhile of walking in the heat lol. Since we were broke, we headed on over back to my house where we watched The Fugative...since apparently according to Brian it was a crime in itself that I hadn't seen that movie. I'm trying to convince him to go and see The Village because it looks cool, scary and able to be mocked...the best kind of movie!!!! Lol. Hehe...well I'm gonna go do somethin, the night is still young. I am SO sore...don't know HOW on earth I'm gonna be able to ski tommorow!!!! Ahh lol. In pain I guess....no pain no gain! Lol. I am outie for nows so buh byes!!! =)

      Today...I waterskied. I woke up at 8 a.m. so we could get to the lake at 9 a.m. where it is glass...like cuttin through butter...I was having so much fun. Then we came across these guys on jet ski's that broke down and we had to give them a tow. I got to drive the boat and that was fun stuff. Umm...we didn't get home til 5 p.m. and we're going again Sunday but we're probably not staying as long since it is going to be the weekend. It was overcast which was good because it meant less boats. The sun broke out about an hour before we left, so we got some sun. It was great fun. Had Taco Time for dinner, which was good. Surprised my dad by cleanin out the boat for him before him and my mom got back from lookin at a house we're interested in buying. I also found out today that if this all goes through we have to bunk with my aunt who lives in a one bedroom cabin with an attic...we get the attic....all of us together...that's gonna suck major. It's out by Flaming Geyser Park. My grandma lives up on the hill in a 3000 square foot house and won't let us bunk with her because of our dog. What a mean woman. Grr...she better not expect me to go play Skipbo with her...lol. Anyways, called up Brian to see if he wanted to join me and the rest of the tribe to go skiing on Sunday...hopefully he says yes because then I won't be entirely bored to death on the boat since everyone has their "buddy" lol. Plus we can teach him how to ski! It's gonna be great! He better say yes lol. (No pressure). Hehe. Learned somethin new about one of my friends today.......in detail of which I did not want to hear......but he's always been OPEN with me and this was NO exception apparently....nasty. You figure it out.....Lol. Anyways, Saturday is off....surprise surprise....lol. That means the chance of me seeing Brians pearly whites the first time is going down as days are added. (If I'm not the first to see I'll be mad so you better leave you're electrical tape on you're retainers LOL JP....you did put it on right? Jp) Hehe I'm bored. Well I'm gonna go do...sumthin....ttyl.

      Today...I washed my Mustang baby. Lol. He was DIRTY! He looked more brown than blue. Plus I'm goin out with the guys (maybe...pending on if they aren't gonna be too tired lol) on Saturday to the mall and if we're crusin all the way to Auburn, he's gotta be a clean Mustang baby. Lol. I can't get any attention in a dirty car...wink wink lol. Yay, I love my car for various reasons: 1. It's an awesome car 2. It's a classic 3. It's my favorite color, blue and 4. It's a guy magnet lol. Hehe. It's great! Last night at ten thirty I picked up Ashley M at 10:20 to spend the night. She went home at 10 because she was too tired to wake up. Lazy butt. Lol. We ended up goin to bed at like 11 because I was DEAD TIRED...have no clue why. Lol. Then I called Brian to see what was goin on with the plans, he didn't sound too happy to be talking to me...and I have no idea why...sad. Apparently Saturday should be a go if I ever get a hold of those boys....hehe. Then Katie Lewis called, she was in town today. She lives in Milton so we hung out for awhile. We went to Starbucks and I got my FAVORITE drink in the world, Vanilla Bean Frappacino. Yummy! Especially on a hot day, it tastes like vanilla ice cream, but better! Lol. We walked around the stores in Enumscratch...Over the Edge and Walgreens because she needed some highlight stuff. It was fun stuff. I had to then get back in my overheated car...sticky situation with shorts and leather seats lol. Oh well, I survived once I got out of the 25 m.p.h. zones. Yup Yup...well I gotta go with my dad to Des Moines to pick up my brothers car so that he can fix the brakes. Good to know someone else is having brake problems besides myself. Hehe. I think I should drive his car since I've had great experience with cars and brake problems...and I'm only 16!!! I find that good! Lol. Experience is a good thing to have...in certain ways lol. Hehe...wow I'm hyper and I just got done practicing pool so you can just imagine where my brain is....lol! Haha...well I'm gonna go now before I go further down the gutter way...I'm outies for now. Ttul and luv ya'll bunches =)

      I ended up having some fun today. Curtis came over at like 9 p.m. and we played pool. Lol. It was fun stuff. We "chilled" as he so rightly put it lol. He had to leave at 10 p.m. though and that's basically it. I was all gross and stuff like ten minutes before he came over so I ran to take a shower when the water pressure was zero, then I ran to dry it....got half way done, then he showed up lol. It was funny. Yeah that's about it. He had to go home early cuz he's got school and work in the morning lol. So yeah, I'm gonna go do sumthin...dunno what lol. Anyone wanna hang out tommorow, give me a hollar! Lol. Ttul bye!

      Today, I was bored beyond belief. Lol. I woke up, did nothing. Baked some Almond Cookies that have icing on them but I don't think they taste very good. I think they needed more almond than it called for. Umm.............Friday I get to go water skiing. That will be great fun. Then Saturday I get to sit on my butt. I was gonna go to Wild Waves on Saturday, but I can't go now because I don't have any cash to buy a ticket lol. Smart me. Oh wellz...I'll just prolly sit around and do nothing! Lol. Maybe I'll get a hold of some people to hang out with. Well I'm gonna go see what exciting things I can plan for myself. Prolly, ummmmmmm...................i dunno.......I'm gonna go read or work out or somethin....who knows....who cares. Outies.

      I BURN! I went to Allison G's "Christmas in July Party." Lol. It was interesting that's all I'll say lol. A plus was her grandma had an inground pool. It was SO nice. The bad thing about it was I got even MORE burnt to the point of now I am in constant pain. To add to my pain, I went down her slide and I hit the bottom of the pool straight legged, cuz it was supposed to side you to the deep end and I ended up sliding to the shallow end and now my leg hurts REALLY bad. If I just sit my leg gets stiff and UGH it HURTS! Alison Murray and I have a great time being idiots of course, as always. Lets see, what else went on, we watched "A White Christmas." MOST STUPID MOVIE ON THE PLANET. Ali M brought it, which explains it because despite her being my best buddy, she doesn't have the BEST taste in movies. I mean, there are just a few that are in question, like Oklahoma. Lol. Anyways, earlier today my cousin Jamie and his wife Sally dropped off their three minions for us to watch while they went to OzzFest. I had to drive them there and drop them off. All I heard from the concert was crap so I don't know what they were expecting lol. I got the Da Vinci Code in the mail today to read cuz I ordered it on the internet. Great stuff. Oh and to add to my blog from yesterday, I didn't tell what Ali M did in the theatre. We were all alone and we were bored. We were eating Snickers Popables and I said "I'll give you a handful of change if you throw that at the screen." So she threw one at the screen and just to clarify for anyone who doesn't know, the walls are hard and not a nice pull down screen. LOL. She left a chocolate mark too....we saw it when the screen went white for a minute. IT WAS GREAT. Yeah that's all I gotta say about today. Brian got his braces off, don't know how that all went. I'm sure he's a stud. LOL. Hehe. AnYwAyZ I'm OuTiE fOr NoWz! TaTa! ;)

      Well...because dumb and dumber (yes Brain...I know "dumber" isn't a word, but it's relating to the movie Dumb and Dumber so live with it and keep the sarcasm on that to yourself please! Thank you). Anyways, Alison calls up at oh...5 p.m. shortly after Anthony tried to conn me into seeing Bare Naked Ladies...any band with the word "naked" in it scares me personally...lol. Plus, they're guys...so that's just strange. Lol. Anyways, Ali and I decide to go to Wild Waves! FUN FUN FUN in da sun! So I go and pick her up at 7 Sunday night to spend the night. We go into town so I can take out some mulah for the trip lol and that's all good fun. We get home and act like idiots for awhile...do girly things like whiten our teeth, do our nails, talk about boys, and talk about boys...and laugh our heads off...and yeah it was fun fun fun. We finally get to sleep after having my mom come in and yell at us to quiet down about 20 times lol. We rise early and get our hair done up in french braids so we match! Cute Cute! Hehe. We get breakfast made for us by my mom...which was...interesting....when she went to the bathroom we threw it in the garbage...after eating the toast. She tried an experiment with baco's in eggs instead of REAL bacon..ew....that's all I gotta say about that lol. Anyways, we head off to the Wild Waves and get front row parking because we were there at 9:45 where it opens at 10. We are all ready to go and go on the four main colored waterslides. The purple, blue, yellow, and red ones. They were awesome, AND NO WAIT. This dude that is supposed to be the lifeguard guy on top though goes "my job is not to get wet, so don't get me wet" he was such a pansy. So when we went down I threw some water at him. He wasn't too happy lol. Hehe. Then we headed off to the wade pool. That was great. We dove for pennies we saw on the bottom because we didn't know what to do cuz the waves weren't on. After awhile we got bored with that and went on to bigger and better things. THE KONGA RIVER. We go down the river for like 10 times around. Alison goes "Hey, have you seen the Notebook?" I look at her like she's an idiot. "the MOVIE" she replies. I go " I went with you to see it you BLONDE!" She starts CRACKING up! She was SO embarassed it was just hilarious! Hehe. Then we get hungry so we decide to go get some pizza. The dude their rings up our order and it comes to SIXTEEN BUCKS! I go NO NO NO and he goes "oops....my mistake" it was only 8. Thank GOD! LOL. We eat that and we couldn't tell if we were hungry or it was ACTUALLY good...prolly the hungry part....it was kinda hard and still cold lol. But anyways, then we go get wet s'more. Then we decide to go on some rides after we eat an elephant ear that tasted like crap. Lol. We go on The Wild Thing. We wait in line and behind us are the two HOTTEST guys I've seen in a LONG time that weren't on TV. They had to be at least 19 or 20 years old. I'm watchin the ride go by and I look down and this dude is staring at me...he looks away and starts to smile and I'm TRYING to get Ali's attention, but her being the blonde that she is doesn't catch on at all. Then we rush up to the front of the ride because we want the VERY front. I tell her what's going on and I look back where the guys were waiting for the very back seat and the dude is STILL staring at me. Smiles....looks away. I'm like OH GEEZ...what's wrong with me now...Then they ended up getting on the car before us and as they're going by our eyes get totally locked, and as he passes he does the sexy nod of the head like "hey, how you doin'" look and I just go into shock. What is his problem? Does he need glasses? Oh well, I'm not complainin...lol. We get on real quick and get our brains jolted around in our skulls and prolly have massive head injuries from the ride lol and get off and go for the Ring of Fire. We look up ahead in line and guess who's there...the dudes from the Wild Thing. He looks back at me. Smiles. I smile. It was GREAT. He blushed LOL. We ended up sitting behind them on the ride! It was great. Never actually talked to him though...sad pathetic me....oh wells. We ride a few more rides and decide to go home. I drop her off after a miscommunication with my mother over if we could go to a movie or not and go back to get her to go to a movie lol. After I help her weed the corn, we go and see A Cinderella Story...ABSOLUTELY CUTE MOVIE! Definately a chick flick though lol. We get to the theatre at 5 when it doesn't start til 7:15. We hang out in the mall for awhile, go shop and eat a bit after muchos walking.  We walk on over to the theatre and we give our tickets to a lovely lady in a wheel chair, who was mentally disabled. Believe me she was mental. She took our tickets and goes "A Cinderella Story...A Cinderella Story...A Cinderella Story...Gate 12....A Cinderella Story...Right....Gate 12...." I know it's mean but I was trying SO hard not to laugh....and I didn't! Be proud for that! Lol. We bought some candy and turn the corner and bust into tears of laughter. Ahead of us on one of those dancing arcade games is a guy that had to be like 200 pounds doing river dance...Holding on to a bar and jumpin around, I was crying, mascara everywhere, we ran to the bathroom to laugh. It was SO funny, you had to be there, but I mean honestly, some people can get away with that game, this dude couldn't. It looked like an ocean was kept under his shirt everytime he moved....the waves of fat were just rollin and rollin and rollin along...Oh geeze. When we got to the theatre we were still fourty five minutes before showtime. So we were going to go in but the cleaning guys were in there because the last movie just let out. So we wait. We went back to watch fatty and laugh a few more times but then didn't notice if the people left or not. We quietly started to sneak into the theatre but we heard voices so we ran out. Then we started to laugh. We tried again approximately 10 minutes later and ran out again. We are such spazes. We go a THIRD time and go in...no one was in there...we were hearing VOICES and no one was in there...what a couple of idiots we are! We watch the movie, and go home but on the way get Frugals shakes which were good. I drop her off and am here now but I'm going to bed now so I'll talk later. OH WAIT! When we were eating at the Super Mall eating, she was zoning and I asked her what she was doing. She goes "thinking" and I go "about what?" and she goes "stuff." I don't buy that so I annoy her by going..."It's Anthony isn't it." She says ".....no...." I go "YES IT IS," and she yells "so what?!" I ALMOST DROPPED DEAD. She finally admitted it! I WAS SINGING Joy to the world...the truth is told. She LIKES ANTHONY!!!!!!Hehehehehehe......Brian....secret mission for you.....since you're "so good" at that...not but we'll give you another try lol. Heheheheheheheahahaha. Well g2g bye bye! Oh yeah sorry bout my comment there Brian, I was in a bad mood so disregard it. Oh yeah, you get you're braces off tommorow! You thought you were hot now...wait til the hardware's gone....then someone will be all over you...a girl you like but said she doesn't like you...if you catch my drift LOL. Hehe bye!

      Today has a sucky start. I wake up at 8:30, 9 a.m. to get ready to pick up Anthony and Brian. Shower...dress...straighten hair and get done getting ready by 10:10. I call up Anthony so make sure it's a go...it's not. He's half asleep. Says he stayed up til five a.m. reading. What I don't really know. So then I'm all fine then be that way and mock him. He gets a lil pissed at that but oh well. Then I call up Brian who didn't wanna go anymore since Anthony wasn't going and plus, he has to practice for his drive. That's understandable but all day? I dunno. This just sucks cuz Alison called last night and wanted me to go to Lake Tapps with her today, but now it's too late, so now I get to vegetate by myself again. Boys screw things over. Oh well. I'm just gonna go do nothing now.

      I went to the fair AGAIN with Jaclyn Welsh. We had SO much fun. First thing we did...hit Starship 2000. We were the only two people on it and he let us go three times! That was SO awesome. It was really hot in their though. It wasn't as fun as when I went w/ the guys because come on....two guys...good greif what's not to like? lol. Yeah. Then we run over and get an Elephant Ear. Yummy. Lol. Then we watch a bit of rodeo, which it was Jaclyn's first rodeo and I thought that was hilarious. Living in Enumclaw all her life and never seen a rodeo? What killed me was she goes "are clowns always at rodeos?" DUH...Hence RODEO CLOWN...Then there was this big ol bull with a round hump on it's back and the announcer goes "that hump is the last rodeo clown...they don't digest well..l" it was funny there. The rodeo clowns were losing their pants all the time which was rather interesting...at least they had oversized underwear! LOL. Then they couldn't catch this one bull so they brought out the hunky cowboys...they couldn't lasso him, so they brought out the rodeo dog which ran the other way. Then it went up and kept nippin at the bulls nose...smart animal. It was great. Then we move on to ride more rides after we get almost conned into joining modeling agencies....yeah right...me a model...Jaclyn I could see becuase she's a twig and she's tall...PERFECT lol. I'm short and a cow...as I've been told and cow's don't fit on the runway lol. We go and ride on the looptee loop ride whatever its called...Ring of Fire at Wild Waves...only two on it. Fun stuff...All these guys were sittin their watchin us and it was funny...they were HOT! They were tan and they were shirtless.....mmmmmhmmmm.....lol. Now that's somethin good to look at lol. Anyways, then we move on to the one ride that goes fifty miles per hour as Anton said...the Space Orbit or whatever? We had other people on and he told us to scream and Jack and I were the only one's to actually scream...and boy we SCREAMED lol. Then we got off and I saw Arlene, Toni, Jena, and Brianna all around various places...that was fun. We saw a hypnotist turn a guy into Shania Twain. Gave him dice for boobs...a wig...and a mike and when he came out of it he was so embarassed he turned as red as his shirt. It was FUNNY! lol. Then we leave...nuthin special. Earlier the two of us went to Starbucks and I got a sad excuse for my favorite Starbucks product...Vanilla Creme Frappachino...no coffee in it...just basically fancy Vanilla Icecream with a twist lol. We drive around sippin on it and I was at this interesection and this guy turns on the road we were on and he was totally staring me down and he WAS HOT. I have NO idea who it was but HE WAS CUTE! lol. Hehe...good day. Until I just remembered I saw ERIC in hid stinkin car...it's bad enough I had to see the car I SAW HIS FACE....not a pretty sight...think guy in truck...think guy in truck...think shirtless guys at fair....mkay I'm all good now...hehe well I'll write more laterz.

      Well I'm two days behind. Nothin special yesterday lol. I played PS2 all day and spent the night at Ashley M's house. We watched Dirty Dancing Havana Nights and the only reason that was a somewhat decent movie was because Patrick Swayze had a camio in it. Lol. Hey, he may be old....but he is still a hottie lol. Especially in tight black pants...Hehe. Anyways, we raided the Rite Aid and Exxon station for food. I ended up getting the biggest jug of water you've ever seen for a single drink size. I drank it all during the movie...lol. Anyways...Next day...come home play more PS2. Beat the game...move on to the fourth one in the set. LOL. Go online for awhile. Anthony is on. We decide we'll con Brian into coming over and we'll all have a grand ol time. Lol. Well later on after deliberation and confusion I go and pick up Brian at exactly seven o'clock...ON THE DOT! Lol. He's ready by his gate as usual in his usual hat lol. We go to my house, play a game of pool, then migrate out to the back yard on the trampoline. He was too chicken to jump though so we just sat lol. There were people coming to look at my house for the second time, and Brian got the pleasure of meeting the gay guy from previous entries...lol...I taunted Brian saying "aren't you gonna go up and see you're boyfriend?" Lol. Oh he liked it.....lol hehe I'm so mean =). Anways, Anthony shows up finally and is dead from biking in eXtreme heat. lol. We go downstairs and play pool while watching this comedy tour movie...pretty funny. My second time seeing it actually lol. Anyways...after a few laughs, a few scratches, and a few jump balls thanks to Brian, we had to head out. Anthony rides his bike ahead of us while Brian and I were smart and took the car. We get to the end of the road and Anthony ends up falling...hurting himself rather badly. I being the kind soul I am (while Brian just sat there) go help Anthony put the bike in the trunk and drive him home first as he bled...lol. We dropped him off then I was off taking Brian home...that's pretty much it...lol. Now I'm off to go play more PS2!!! Woo! Bye bye now!  Oh we're supposedly hanging out Sunday...dunno what we're gonna do though. Lol. Any ideas....yell it out! lol.

      Today I went to the fair with Brian and Anthony. It was great fun lol. I went and got Anthony after lots of confusion of whether we were going or not and trying to contact him and yada yada yada you get my drift. Anyways, so I go and get Anthony, and he comes out dressed in a white shirt and baby blue swishy adidas pants! Not what I expected. It was normal...it was a change. Not a bad change lol. Anyways, then we're off to get Brian who was dressed in his usual QuickSilver Hurly hat attire. Lol. We get goin down the road to go to the fair and are stopped like a mile or two away and don't move for like an hour. Maybe the fact that it was dollar everything day was the reason lol. WELL PARKING SURE WASN'T NO DOLLAR!!! lol Anyways, we get into the fair and we roam around. We go ride this one ride first that makes you go flat up against the walls and Brian looked like he was about to puke. I love that ride! Lol. Anthony said the humorous remark of "fat people get skinny on this ride...or spread out." Lol it was hilarious!!!!!!! Anyways...after the ride was over, we went over to this other ride that spins you around horizontally while sitting in a car. Three people can fit if you like being in a sardine can. Anyways...we were bickering on who sits where and Anthony being the intelligent being as he is says to me "Please don't get mad when I say this...." I say "okay" whatever...can't be that bad lol....BUT IT WAS! "Normally the heavier person sits on the outside" is what he tells me. NEVER SAY ANYTHING TO A GIRL THAT MAKES HER OUT BEING HEAVY...EVEN IF SHE IS...YOU ONLY PISS OFF A TIME BOMB. lol. Yeah...so I was pissed at him for awhile. Then we road the ride with Anthony in the inside, me in the middle, and Brian outside. He got to eat my hair as it flew cuz I guess he couldn't keep his mouth closed lol jp. We were squishin the poor guy...well Anthony was literally attempting to squash him. I tried to stop him but in the position I was in it just didn't work. Yeah...anyways... the other rides we went on I was also in the middle with the exception of one ride that only seated two. It was me and Brian and Anthony and this one kid that didn't have a partner. Lol. I swear...Brian is sick now or somethin after all that motion!!!! Anyways...we go and play a few games. Anthony saw his good friend Brianne....lol working at one of the booths. He wanted a scooter but she told him herself the game was rigged...put Pam on the beer bottles your supposed to put rings on I hear. Lol. Then we play this stupid game where you're supposed to spray water in the clowns face and blow up a balloon. We only got over there because of the "charm" of the carni. (New word taught to me by Anthony: Carni= Noun Meaning carnival worker). Lol. Yeah he yelled that he needed three people to play and screamed over his mike to us half way across the fair lol. We play...first time Brian's was rigged to where people noticed so he got a free game and won the next one. The prize...Puss in Boots. lol Hehe it was great. I got it in the end...don't know why...figured he'd wanna keep somethin like that LOL. Then later on we go and see the goats....well we were in search of a certain someone but she wasn't there. Brian said she saw her somewhere but she was with a bunch of four H people so we didn't wanna disturb her lol. Then later on in the evening Brian gets the biggest hurkin corn dog you've ever seen...and he inhaled it like it was air! lol. It was funny. Then we leave and go out to the car...after Brian called me a cow....still peeved if you are reading this....We get in my car and we don't move more than two car lengths for about a half an hour. Brian acts like he's on crack. I'm pissed because one way or another the two of them both slip up and call me fat and a witch w/ a capital B. lol. Then Anthony was yelling at random strangers like "how'd you like the fair' nad "hey!!" one chick said hey when someone told her not to talk to weirdos. Then Anthony yelled back "what'd you call me?"  they reply "a weirdo," then he said "oh...just makin sure." Lol it was great. Brian continued to be on crack...noticed that he was pissing me off for real and let me wear his hat lol. Then we finally get moving and Brian was still acting like he was on crack. Anthony had his head out the window like a dog. Brian broke Anthony's necklace trying to pull him into the window. I drop Brian off then Anthony acts not happy skippy. Apparently he was bummed about his necklace and tired kinda. Oh well...We're all gonna do somethin on Sunday which will be fun I am sure. Lol. Well I'm beat so I'm outie for nows! Bye bye!

      Today...I did...(you guessed it!) NOTHING!!!!! Well...my dad worked on my motorcycle's gas tank. He put this goop in it that is SUPPOSED to coat the rust that is inside and protect it from rusting further...which it didn't. Instead it cracked. It cracked in large pieces, which were quite a bit bigger than the hole in which the gas goes in. This is a problem. That means that my dad had to go purchase 20 gallons of Acetone and pour it into my tank and melt it all out...which worked like a charm. The reason he was doing it all was because there was nothing really I could do. Whenever my dad works on something, he's so involved in it no one can help...he's pulled into it and no one can help...you just...stare...CREEPY? Yes.  Umm...let's see here...I straightened my hair cuz I was bored...That's exciting...yes I know. Ummm...I baked some more chocolate chip cookies because some smart person left the lid to my last batch open, making them become stale...THAT SUCKED! Lol. Umm yeah...pretty uneventful day. I'm going to the mall with Ann and possibly Randi if she is up to it. We all belong to a lovely organization called BHE...Boy Haters of Enumclaw...Yes...its great fun. They both lost their boyfriends on Friday so they are sad, and I have some issues with some guys which was the minimum requirement for getting in. LOL. Well I'm gonna go to bed now so I'll go do that...buh byez.

      Okay...today way...interesting! Lol. After Ali left, I got dressed and wrote my previous blog to make up for the one that I didn't put in yesterday. Then I got in my car and got Brian. We came to my place and we walked all the way to Anthony's (my second time in two days) but it was a lot easier since I actually knew where I was going this time. Brian walks up and dings the doorbell and we hear a dog yelling and someone/thing coming towards the door. The person that came to the door had a "ciggie" in one hand and the devil dog in the other. Brian studders asking her if Anthony was home. She replied "No...He's at a boy scout camp out." I ABOUT DIED! Anthony....in boy scouts....that's a riot. Apparently he won't be back until Tuesday. We told her who we were and she seemed to know who I was which was slightly freaky. OH WELL. Then the two of us headed back to my place. I think the heat was getting to Brian because he started randomly talking about sheep and Baaing. Speaking of sheep...we saw a sheep on the way and Brian goes "look...a goat...or a sheep...or a very large dog" apparently he didn't pay attention to animal classification in his NORMAL biology class....me being smarter in that category since I took AP...LOL. Then he sees a cows rear and goes "look...a large cat." OMG it was funny. Anyways on the way back we were discussing what really could have happened to Anthony because we weren't buying the whole "boy scout" story. He thinks he ran away and was living in the trees we were passing, while he also thought that he was dead and it was a cover. We also thought that maybe the person who answered the door was Anthony who had undergone surgery. We even believed that he might have been the dog in her hand. THIS is where the heat REALLY got to him because Brian thought that maybe the mom smoked him...just wrapped him up and smoked him like a giant cigarette. WOW...he is crazy...That's when I decided that I needed him to get in the shade or coolness STAT! We get to my place and we play one game of goofy pool...only one because he beat me horribly because I kept scratching. I didn't even hit the ball... it went straight into the pocket. IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol Then we come upstairs and play a quality game of Crash Team Racing...that was interesting! Lol. I beat his butt in that game that's for sure! Lol. My dad then came in and asked if we wanted something when he was on his way home from the Home Depot. We decided Subway...his no lettuce...mine no tomato...lol what weirdo kids are we! lol. Then while waiting for our food, we decided to go downstairs where it was cooler. We played this staring don't laugh game for like TWO hours and I suck at it. He is definately the master. I started getting better in the end though. We know know that "Cracker Jack" "Celery Stick" "Candy Cane" "Vomit" and "Light Switch" make you crack up. They all were of his doing. He was trying to say "Wallace and Gromitt" and said "Wallace and Vomit" instead. HoW fUnNy Is ThAt? Very I think! LOL it was great! Then we get our food finally and it was yummalicious. 3:30 came around and then I had to take him home. Sad....lol...no more laughiness! Oh wells...I'll just make him come over agian. Hope he enjoyed himself...it was fun. Brian then developed the fine idea to start listing off the things in the room. It was HILARIOUS. He's all "there's a rectangular picture above the cd player which has a smaller one located on its left side and a radio on the right," and it was funny...Guess you had to be there but it was great. I also have these two different colored light bulbs and he decided that he liked the blue bulb ofer the green bulb...nice......hehe. What was a real riot was he started saying "you're staring at my hair...yes I know it's beautiful" and stuff it was HiLaRiOuS! lOl. WoW iM bAcK tO wRiTiNg LiKe ThIs LoL...Anyways that's all for now....Chelsea Outie

      Last night my buddy Alison came over. We hadn't seen each other in like 5 weeks! It was crazy. We laughed, we cried...from laughing so hard! Lol. Whenever we get together its like we just laugh at EVERYTHING. Doesn't matter what it is, we just laugh. Lol. For example, last night we went to BlockBuster to get some DVD's to watch (Secret Window and Paycheck). We were driving down 244th and she had her window down with her arm sticking out. My dad's Altima has automatic windows, so me being the driver I had complete control, so I started rolling up her window. She screamed bloody murder. It was hilarious. We were being so stupid it was funny. Then, when we were driving through town, all of the stations had no music on them, so we were desperate for a song to "jam" to. We check 106.9 as a last resort and they had Josh Groban on it....opera......not something to "jam" to, but it was all we had. So we mocked it in our "best" opera voices we could get LOL. Earlier in the evening we walked down to Anthony's aka Anton's house. We were worried whether he was dead or alive lol. So we think he was on the street right next to mine...he wasn't...the street next was a dead end with a bunch of six year olds yelling "hello" to us and wanting us to come into the pool with them. We said we had better things to do with our time....maybe some other day...ha...yeah right.  Anyways, then we try the next road. The next road HAD to be it...we walked all the way through, and it wasn't. So we try the THIRD road and we go "if this ain't it, we're goin home." After being followed by dogs we didn't know, we finally realized it was the correct road. We walk down Anton's road and look for his bright blue house. Now, picture a blue house with blue trim, blue fence posts, blue fence, blue rocks, blue balls on sticks, blue outdoor lights, blue reflectors BLUE EVERYTHING! It was FREAKY! So then we ding the doorbell and we hear the cry of a dog. Figure, with a dog there and the sprinkler on, they should be home...no luck. Alison tells me to ding it again but I didn't want to. There was this blue light/sconce thingy that had like the eyes off of potatoes growing out of it. It looked like it was an upside down root or something and it was freaking us out. So she dings the doorbell and like jumps six feet in the air from being so scared. It was a riot.  No luck. He was not home. We tried calling him....no luck....we could hear the phone ringing from inside so either they are all deaf, dead, or on vacation. Hopefully the latter of the two! Lol.  Yes...now I have to recap all of the "blonde" moments Ali and I had. Lets see...this morning I hit my head on the freezer door...Alison made weird faces at the breakfast table...Alison acts afraid of automatic windows ever since last night...Her hair this morning was like six feet high and six feet deep...I tripped in a pot hole...and the blonde moment of all was we were trying to rap....THAT WAS FUNNY. Lol. Good times...good times....that's basically what last night was all about. Well I g2g get ready to pick up Skinny B so we can go see if Anthony is dead or alive....do some real investigating. Lol. TTUAL. ByE bYe! ThIs LoOkS kInDa CoOl...AwEsOmE. cHeLsEa OuTtIe!

I made chocolate chip which are fantastic! Yummy!       Then a guy comes to our house to show it off. HE WAS GAY! He had a high pitched voice and looked like one of the dudes off of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. OMG it was hilarious. I was rollin on the floor.      Then I worked out to get my flab into shape! It was FUN. I jumped rope and ran on the tread mill...did sit ups until I about died...and I did a bunch of retarded other things lol.      Next...a cold shower. No need to worry about the hot water running out at my house. I couldn't get it cold enough!       After that I was online a bit. Chit Chatted with my friends.

         Life is fun. Actually, life currently sucks. I do not know what is wrong with me. Everywhere I go, everything I do seems to be wrong. It is like I am in a maze and keep running into dead ends. My friends abandon me...and only seem to want to be around me if they have nothing better to do. They do not wish to simply hang out with me for me and me as a higher priority. It is like I am always on the backburner, set aside until they need me for some tedious task.    I do not understand. It just does not make sense. My friends are not acting like friends. At least most of them.    Our house is up for sale. I am trying to make my parents move out of Enumclaw because I am fed up. I do not belong here. I do not feel accepted. I am not in the "group" and I try but most of the time I am only there as a last resort. The only reason I made VP was because no one else ran against me, not because anyone actually voted for me. When it boils down to it I probably didn't even get enough to win against someone anyway. I'm just there by the luck of the draw.    I do not know. Maybe life will be better tommorow. Wait. It already is tommorow. That just means another sucky day.

         Hey...who in their life could ever think that they could say "Someone (besides my father) thinks my mother is hot." Well...that question was answered today.   My mother and I were walking in the Fred Meyer. We're walking out after purchasing our items at the U-Scan...when this guy, had to be in his 40's who worked there was walking past. He gave me a casual smile...then looked to my right where my mother was walking. He slowed his pace...tilted his head...and if anyone has ever seen a mouth full of white chicklets...that's the grin he gave my mother as drool was pouring out from the side of his mouth. OMG what the heck! Here I am...young and in my prime, and people are checking my mother out! I mean, sure he's forty...but OMG she's like 50! Ahh...nasty picture. I have never laughed so hard in my life....LET ME TELL YOU THAT! geeze...   Besides that episode...today was an ordinary day. Except my mother has gone psycho and got me 2 credit cards. One for Pac Sun and the other for American Eagle...AWESOME STUFF!!!!!! I don't know what bit her today, but I like it! lol. Well that is it for now so over and out! Buh byez!

         To elaborate on my earlier edition...I am babysitting the child from HELL-O....lol. Yeah, wellz I was TRYING to run on my tread mill cuz I need to shed oodles of pounds before school starts, I'm currently a mess and dislike myself LOL and mom goes "Chelsea....go get Mikey...you have to watch him on the trampoline or he will kill himself..." Yeah, so I had to go at watch him jump up and down. Then I figured that I could run around the yard since my treadmill/sit up time had been cut short. Well here comes tweedle dumb trying to catch me...keep in mind he is only six lol.     Then earlier we took him to the cemetery with us where my mom's daddy is at, and he would NOT shut up...and this is a National Cemetery with all the war heros. So, my mother being as off the wall as she is, tells him "Now Mikey, you have to be very quiet because if your not, the army men will shoot you. They hide in the bushes." HE BOUGHT IT! Omg he was goin "I see one! over there!" He was all quiet and it was FANTASTIC! I thank God and my parents for them not deciding to have another child after me, and ESPECIALLY a boy...no offense, but six year old boys are ANNOYING AS HECK! Ugh....lol   So yeah, all is well....I g2g now so ttul bye bye!

Today was boring....did nuthin....not planning on doing much but babysit the child from HELL! He is a terror to society and should be put in a padded room!    Seriously, this kid has almost set fire to a house making smores, almost drowned a cat in a tub when he shoved it into a plastic lid, gets lost always, and screams and does the EXACT opposite of what you tell it to do. It's not a kid, its the spawn of satan. Straight from the bowels of hell is what that kid is. Ugh...too bad he can't go back. But if I am in a bad mood for the next too days, NOT MY FAULT its SATANS!    Adios Amigos! Love Y'ALL!!!!!

         Guys....are retarded. They say one thing, and do another. They want relationships, but just for the booty call. Ugh...FEELINGS ARE PART OF IT DEAL WITH IT!!! AHHH! Or like some people say they aren't ready for it or are "too immature and babyish" that's fine. Just don't lead people on for two years lol.   Another thing, I am sick and tired of people telling me that I am an emotional wreck and need a counselor because I have too much drama going on! What the HELL!? Emotions and drama and feelings are what makes people people for goodness sake! How do you know if anyone even cares or is hurting, or UGH!! Guys are stupid...they just make me mad....They don't understand! They most certainly do not know how to communicate! The real kick in the pants is when you tell guys something, then they go off and tell every other Tom, Dick, and Harry in the country, or make fun of you for it. THAT makes me pissed off...Oh well...that's what is in their genes...

         Today I finally did something interesting! First of all I wake up and am hunky dorey...which is good. Then I have to drive with my mother to Des Moines so we can let my brother borrow our carpet cleaner. She's goin 80 down highway 167 and every other highway in between here and Des Moines. I was entirely freaked out. The reason that she was speeding was because we had to be home by 12:30 so that I could go pick up Brian and Cassie for the mini golf day, and we left home at 11:00. WE FLEW! We got home at 12:15 though so it was all good.   Then I spruce up, changed my shirt cuz it started to get hot (later on I dreaded not actually wearing a skirt or shorts it was so hot lol). I go and pick up Brian and he's all happy go lucky. I met his mama...she seems really nice...but I only said like five words to her, so I dunno what she thinks of me ( I hate it when you don't know what other people's parents think of you...it freaks me out!!!!). Hopefully I didn't do anything too stupid lol.    Then we pick up Perky Cassie, who I swear never tires! LOL. We were going to go to Sumner mini golf, but Brian decided we would go to Maple Valley...It was a lot closer anyways. We get there and we play 18 holes of mini golf...I lost of course...and they tied 56 compared to my 73. Oh wellz! Yeah. Then we were done and didn't know what to do. We decided to go see Anchorman which was a hilarious movie. We had to go back and get Cassie's glasses so she could see the movie, but she ended up not getting them anyways. We stopped by my house cuz the movie didn't start until 4:50. Then we decided we wanted to eat first so we were going to go on down to the A&W down in Bonney Lake.    We get there and it is one of those two places in one thingys, KFC and A&W together. Cassie gets a kids meal with a toy that she never parted with and Brian gets chicken from KFC and I go for the double bacon cheese burger....so good! Brian and I both also got the nice cold root beers in mugs...when it's A&W root beer, you don't skimp. LOL. OH so good!    After that we go to the movie. Brian didn't understand why "females" travel in groups to go to the bathroom. I figured after watching White Chicks he woulda understood by now, but oh well! So Cassie and I tortured him by going in together leaving him outside all alone. I kinda felt bad, but I don't think he minded.    We get into the theatre and the seating arrangement was Cassie, Brian, and then me. So Brian was in the middle of two girls...any other guy would seem ecstatic with this situation, but he looked like he wanted to be anywhere else but there. Maybe it was me...I dunno. lol. He kept saying they should dim the lights and I got on his nerves by saying "so you and Cassie will get closer?" lol. He didn't appreciate that too much, but oh well! I was trying to have good fun. I kinda felt like a third wheel some of the time, I dont know why but oh well. But I am sure Cassie did to when I mentioned inside jokes, but I had to do something to not be the only one outside of a loop. LOL. Anyways, that was my day and I am tired so I am going to bed now. Ttul I'm outie night!

         Today is a new day...all is fine and well...the past is put in it's place and forgotten. After a night of thinking and analization of the past few weeks, I have come to realize that it was probably for the best. All who know about this (one person lol) prolly understand what I mean, but I am going to not dwell on the subject and move on...(who needs a b/f anyway right? LOL)   Yeah, so today I am going minature golfing...great times...my buddies Brian and Cassie get to laugh at my horrible putting skills....woohoo...aren't I excited. Well, I am just the driver so ya know, you never know will go on between them too.. Just Kidding. ANYWAYS...I'll write how that went after I get back, I have to go straighten my hair and stuff...people seem to like it better that way..."It's different." Lol...for me at least. Adios!

         Well...the guy that was a jerk in the previous blogs...we made up for about a day...then he cut it off because I let one person know minimal information...He said "I'm too immature for this right now." and that "I didn't want to lead you on." He coulda done that two years ago ya know???? It just hurts ya know? I guess I am kind of relieved he came to his realizations...but at the same time I feel like crap...I don't know. I am just going to go to bed now and sulk with myself...outie.

        Today...yes...I picked blueberries...THEY SUCK TO PICK...Especially when your grandmother makes you pick every BLUE blueberry off the tree, and ONLY then you can proceed to another tree (which is why I chose trees with like 10 on them so it looked like I did better lol). Also, you most certainly could NOT drop them, because if you do, she's down on the floor faster than someone in a Code Blue pickin up the stupid thing...what a psycho.   Yeah........that was my day. I started up my online health class finally cuz I'm bored and have nothing better to do lol. It cost $99 bucks, but it'll be worth having it done in seven days instead of ninety as it would in a normal class setting. Yeah, that's it for now...prolly write later cuz I have to go and make a blueberry pie now so I'm outie for nows! Tttul bye!

         I woke up this morning...tired. LOL that's cool huh? My mother has a habit of being very annoying when you are trying (or even trying) to wake up. She jumps on you and shakes you and screams at a very sound barrier breaking pitch! (I may be making it sound a bit worse than it is, but everything is six times worse when you are woken up to THAT! But we love her anyway...   I got a hundred bucks yesterday for grades...that's never happened before...but I don't care it's money which I don't have at this point with no job. Then on top of it I mowed the lawn so I got twenty more buckaroonies to add to it! Fun stuff huh? lol I thought so.   Yeah, I don't know what to do with the cash...I'll decide later when I am fully awake and coherent. LOL. Anywayz........I'm outie for nows.......ttul......bye

           I have been thinking...two friends of mine and I are supposed to go to mini golfing on Sunday...and I think they both have a thing for each other, despite what they say. My conclusion: to let them go alone. They probably don't ever have much time ALONE together to work on things...this could be an opportune moment! Plus, one of the friends is always pushing me away elsewhere so I may as well follow his advice! Hehe...They are going to love me for this! =P I'm sure it will all work out fine anyways!!!!! Well, I am not sure when I'm going to get on later, so if I don't write until tommorow...today was boring...all I did was mow the lawn and make cookies. Bugged Brian, and got interesting perspectives on things, which led me to believe why I should make the descion i did...   Come to think of it, I always told him "the day I get together with ***** is the day you and xxxxxx will get together...." Maybe he is telling me to go for ***** so that he can go for xxxxxx....THAT MUST BE IT!!! Ha! I win...Well now that I have figured out what Skinny B means...I'm going to do all I can to help him...But I'm still not getting with *****!!!!! YAY Bye!

        Today was interesing. Today Brian and I had fun conversations over the internet and are going to go miniature golfing with our buddy Cassie on Sunday...yours truly driving of coure! Lol.   Brian being the great friend that he was also helped try to find out what the idiot was up to...And fed him a taste of his own medicine which I LIKED A LOT. He put into perspective how bad the idiot was being...but I still don't know if he caught on... The idiot AIM'ed me, but said less than seven words...oh well!!!!!!!! His loss....I'm going to bed now cuz I'm tired..G'night and sleep tight...don't let the bed bugs bite your butt!!! (hehee my stupid humor for you)

         Today I went and saw King Arthur with my good buddy Brian. It was fun! There were more people in the theatre this time which was good lol, yet we couldn't mock the movie...what we did mock was a theatre guy that came down the aisle with those red wandy thingys in a roller scooter for the disabled people. It was funny. Then Brian TRIED to eat his weight in popcorn but couldn't keep it in his mouth long enough LOL.   Anyways, then we came home (to my house). We played a gutterminded game of pool...then my mother calls and tells me she has my report card saying "we'll talk about it when you get home" in a mean way. I get to acting like a total retard in front of Brian (still embarassed from the situation) because I was so totally freaked out! I thought I mighta gotten like a B or something!!! He thought I was hyperventalating, which was funny in itself.   My mother comes home and my grades are all good. All A's and one A-, which was fine. Then I got some stuff I ordered from PacSun in the mail today...a trucker hat, a belt, three socks, and a kewl necklace. It's pretty awesome. Brian and I then resumed our Gutter Minded game of pool, ranging from gags of "gimmie those balls" to "hey, your a girl...you shouldn't have any balls..." lol it was great fun.   Brian and I then played Need for Speed as he insisted I should get back together with the jerk from earlier blogs...I disagree. So then I bugged him on who he'd go out with and all this fun stuff. His answer was quite interesting...too bad he isn't interested in dating yet =P. Then his mama called. She was having trouble with their new DSL and he had to go home and fix it. He is the computer genius of course...hey, he loves his mama, he has to take care of her! Lol. Yeah, so now I'm here...alone and bored not knowing what to do with myself...Yup...Well I'm going to go make dinner or read or do something...tan since the sun actually came out...I dunno. Anywayz, I'm outie for nowz! Talk to ya'll laterz!

         I didn't make a blog last night! OOPS! I was just so darn tired! I got Doctor Phil advice from Skinny B. Maybe he should look into doing that for a living instead of journalism...(leave me a better chance of getting a job lol)Naw, the journalism world needs sarcastic people like him...that's all its made of.    Yesterday was so exciting! (Not) My mother pulled out Monopoly because she insisted on us playing a game...and to make it even more interesting, it was Disney Monopoly. Wow...what a boring life i lead!!!!!   Anyways...Let's see here...the guy that I had been having the problem with and I had it going okay for awhile...until he invited me over for an hour to hang out then he slams the door in my face saying I can't come in because his sister just came home...GOODNESS GRACIOUS! Geeze..what an idiot. I mean, I have met his sister once before...not on purpose but I have...Or was it really his sister?????????? Lol...let's not go down that road!    Anywho...Today I am going to see King Arthur with Brian and then he's comin back to cream me at pool...so he thinks...hehehe...let's see that beginners luck fade fast! Ha!     That's all I have for now! This is Curly, Over and Out! =D

        WELL...The past two days have been pretty dramatic...lol but it is looking up! That is good. Today I wrote that certain person an email telling him we need to talk. I kinda understand some things he said, but most of it was dumb lol. A friend last night who also knows this person helped point out a few things though so it's easier to understand...Go Skinny lol jp.   Anyways, tomorrow I'm going to see King Arthur which will be fun. Maybe we'll be the only people in the theatre again. That would be a riot. More mocking in store I am sure!    Anyways, it's only 10:30 so there isn't much that has happened today. My brother Justin is sick, but he's going to get betta, we hope! Anyways, I'll write more tonight unless nothing exciting happens lol Bye!

        Tuesday sucks as much as yesterday...Nothing to do but bask in my loneliness and think about how last night sucked. All day I listened to the same depressing cd by Evanescence. I tried to get hold of friends to talk to but they were either not home, busy, or their mothers were on the phone. I just need someone to talk to besides my mother..she doesn't understand. She says she does, but I don't know...it's just easier to talk to people of MY generation lol.    Today I shopped as usual...what I do when I'm really excited or really depressed. The latter of the two in this case of course. I drove to Taco Time to get some dinner, but I didn't eat it all...I don't have an appetite. I guess that is a good thing cuz then I can get everyone off my back about losing weight...I'll just lose it by not eating! Woo.........   I was going to go for a walk today, but didn't for the reasons of it was raining for a bit and there was no one to walk with. So far, summer sucks...Hopefully it will change...I hope. I don't know. I don't think anyone would want to even see me in the condition I am in anyways lol...I look like I just got done bucking hay again cuz my eyes are all puffy...thanks to last night. But it is getting better...slowly. I'm going to go before I either bore the heck outta people, depress them, or make them think I'm more of a retard than I already am....out.....

        Today I have come to the conclusion that members of the male gender have a constant need to hurt those of the opposite sex. They ramble on talking about nonsense...they get your hopes up, saying all this stuff is going to happen, but when you confront them on it, they totally turn it around making you feel like sh*t.    Guys need to learn how to be honest and not drag girls on, promising them things...especially after TWO FREAKING YEARS...........You don't just throw that away because you don't "fit in with their friends" or "aren't friends with their friends" and all this crap. If you really care about someone, wouldn't you think that what you're friends think didn't matter? Obviously not. I've been through this one before with Price, and didn't think I'd go through it with this guy.    Hell, I even asked him if he was ashamed of me and if he cared what his friends think and he said NO. But then when you ask them again and they say a scenario fo "okay, say it's time for homecoming and my friends wanna set me up with another one of the friends in my group...I'm going to have to go with them" HECK NO if you gotta freakin girlfriend you don't ditch them so you can go be with your friends "in a group." Honestly, if you like someone that much, going with someone else shoulddn't even cross your mind....I don't know I just don't understand it... Girls put their hearts on the line and guys just use 'em, abuse 'em and then throw them back. It takes awhile to heal....It hurts....It SUCKS.....

        Today was boring...well it was more of a "no friends to do anything with...so go bond with your father day." My dad took me to the mall to go buy tee shirts and...this is funny...he accompanied me in the "undergarment department." Wow...what a good sport. He so enjoyed accompaning his teenage daughter into such an area...in other words he stood outside by the aisle averting his eyes towards safer places.   After that we went to Home Depot to get salt for our water softener. He is in his fifties so I got to do the whole bending over backwards bit to pick up the fifty pound bags of the floor and handed to him to put into the cart. Wasn't that heavy, after all that weightlifting in zero hour and all, but ya know.   Then I get home and have absolutely NOTHING to do...wow...what a surprise. Currently my mother is having fun with my hair curling it and what not. It looks really cool...just don't have anywhere to go with it looking like this...sad. Oh well. I'm outie for now because there is nothing really else to say. I tried to get a hold of my friend Jaclyn to go to Starbucks, but she was unavailable and Sydney never answers her phone anymore. Murray is out of town and all my other friends seem to be too...So alone...So bored...Talk to ya'll laterz.

        Today was a fun day. I did lots of fun things, yet none of it partained to celebrating the fourth of July...oh well!    Brian and I went and saw White Chicks today and were the only two people in the entire theatre. It was his first time seeing it and my second, but I thought it was funny enough to go see a second time. The freaks that take your ticket stubs were goin all "movie...white chicks a movie?" and all this crap...they wouldn't know real comedy if it bit them in the butt!   Anywho, after that hilarious piece of art, we went to get ice cream from Baskin and Robins...(or is it Hag N Das? Lol...white chicks joke). That was exciting. Then I needed gas which took FOREVER to fill because my gas tank is retarded...oh well, the price you gotta pay for the awesome ride I got lol.   We got to my house and I taught him how to play pool. He must have some beginners luck because I only won like two games. Most of my losses were from me hitting the eight ball in or scratching on the eight ball though. Then I accidentally jumped the ball and it fell off the table under a chair, which took us like ten minutes to find...my game went all downhill from there lol.   After playin pool for a bit, we went up to my room and I beat him at Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit Two. The greatest PS2 game ever! I love it. After that we made fun of people in the yearbook and I made Brian point out who he thought was hot and who he would go out with...I was on neither list (tear) lol Just Playin!!!! Wow I am a spaz.    My parental units bought us some Taco Time too and my mother thought Brian was weird because he didn't like lettuce on his taco...oh well! People eat only what they wanna eat right? Lol. After that we played more pool then I got to take him home which was fun fun stuff...Now it's nine and I have no fireworks to blow up...sad...oh wellz! I have fire crackers that I can go and blow up slugs with anytime I want lol.   Arthur comes out on Wednesday and looks pretty interesting to see. If anyone wants to go see that on Wednesday, gimmie a holler! It'll be fun fun fun...I'd say in the sun, but since you're in a dark theatre, there really is no sun lol oh WELL! Well, I'm outie for nows so I'll c ya laterz yo! Buh byes!

                Yep...I'm back from my vacation...EARLY! Sucks, I tell ya. We woke up this morning to rain. Listened to the radio and it said "iscolated thundershowers are probable" in Coure d' Alene language, that means it's gonna downpour and you have an increased chance of being hit by lightning. Thusly, we got up outta that joint to where it was dry!            Despite the ucky ending, the trip was fun overall...let's start from the top shall we?           Mom wakes me up at 6 a.m. which isn't a bad thing because I'm pretty used to it because of zero hour last year (conditioning fun fun fun). I crawl into the back of our truck and make sure my mother doesn't open up the window of the canopy that is on the exhaust pipe side...that would be BAD!           We drive along...I fall asleep. We get to Coure d' Alene at about 11 a.m. and I wake up to my mom deciding to be in a shopping frenzy (which I did not complain). I ended up walking out with $300 worth of clothing...(isn't it great being the youngest child by 12 years...I think so)Hehe...well it was school clothes so it wasn't that great. I won't go into great detail of what I got...It would take to long =P!           Then we get to camp... Wolf Lodge Campgrounds just outside Coure d' Alene off Exit 22 off I-90. Fun stuff. We pitch camp and then we sit there on our butts because my brother and his girlfriend and her daughter won't arrive until the next day. The parental units claimed it was too late to ski at 6 p.m. when it's light out until 9:30, but oh well.            I discovered that air-matresses suck and the ground with rocks, holes, and thorns is a lot more comfortable than that is, which is why I eventually ended up deflating my air matress.            Next morning my parents bicker with me over what time we should go out skiing...they think I'd be too cold at 7 a.m. but wouldn't you think it would be for me to decide? I think so.            We get out on the lake and I finally learned how to get up out of the water on one ski. In the past I've gotten up with two ski's and dropped one, making us have to stay in the same area so we don't lose sight of the ski (with their high street value and all) lol. That was fun. Then the fun bragaide (Justin, Sanya, and Courtney) arrive, making us all revert to immature 12 year olds who are obsessed with stupid jokes, noises, and actions...not the most proud moment of my life lol.           Skiing was fun for the next day and a half and I got burnt extremely bad on my face, back, legs...you name it I'm  probably burnt somehow. That inhibited my ability to ski by a large percent being as my life vest would rub against my burt shoulders creating more pain than there was before...but it was worth it!!!           Yep...that was basically my ski trip. Though the freaky thing throughout it is that before I left, my friend Kyle goes "just wait 'til you get to the camp, there will be a red jeep there waiting for you. Now red jeep if you've read in my earlier blogs is the vehicle my ex stalker boyfriend drives, so throughout the entire vacation I saw about...oh...30 red jeeps...exactly like his...wow...am I paranoid or what? I think so.          Yeah...to top off the entire vacation though, we were in the middle of packing and Sanya walks up to me and goes "what is in your hair?" I am initially freaked out thinkin a bug or something...come to find out a bird crapped on my hair...THAT SUCKED! We were leaving and all i could do was rinse it off with a facuset. SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS! SIX HOURS IN A CAR knowing you have bird crap germs in your hair! I was so glad when I saw our house. I bolted out of the back of the truck into a shower! Ugh it sucked...But now I'm clean, red, buring, and Aloe Vera is my best friend right now.           Fourth of July is going to suck because I have NO plans. We were supposed to watch fireworks in Idaho...but obvioulsy we are not...oh well, maybe I'll find something to do...prolly not! I'm outie! Bye =)

      Today...well yesterday, being as it is one o'clock in the morning, Anthony and I went to Ali's family "ho down." Lol. Well...first off at about oh...12:15-12:30 somewhere in there Anthony calls and asks when we were going to go and I said one...one thirty...so until then since we were both bored out of our minds we watched the Olympics...each at our own house but commenting over the phone. We watched Badmitten and the USA was kickin' Russia's butt good lol. We decided to watch that over basketball because we were getting creamed there. Then we found out that despite the fact that we were both watching the same channel...we had different commercials! Woah....funky..lol. One o'clock rolls around so I just say we're gonna go now and go pick em up. Anthony came out with his hair glued...literally! Lol it was funny. We get to Ali's grandma's and sign in after getting a great parking place right up front ROFL. Hehe. We find Ali and she looks so enthused in her yellow Murray Jersey! lol.  We all hang out a bit then Corey Taff comes over... FUN...sarcastically of course. Then Alison's friend Melissa from church comes. Before that Ali and I tried to ditch Anthony with Corey out of spite and suceeded...though he knew what we did....we just made a huge circle it was great. We tried to escape to her house on the four wheeler but they saw us and jumped on the back...we were in search of black markers and it was Alison driving, me behind her, Anthony facing the opposite direction behind me, and Corey in the dinky trailor. We took the bumpy way just to spite them. Anyways...back to when Melissa came. We all walked to Alison's house which is not just a skip, hop, and jump away might I add. We go and visit Chai and leave the boys downstairs...so we thought. In reality the discovered some squirt guns...got water in them and begun banging on her bedroom door. We held them back as Anthony kept hittin his head on it. We finally let them in and that is when they spayed us with water...naughty boys. I pried it out of Anthony's fingers. Corey had one too but I wasn't gonna pry it outta his fingers.......We then left after several moments of akwardness on when we were leaving her room. We go back to the "party" to the great blue grass music and we all go eat somthin...Ali and I head straight for the desert table. Good stuff...umm....Then we went on a hay ride...that was fun. Saw some interesting looking ant hills that resembled a couple friends of a womans....LOL. It was funny. We were sitting on hay bales but then it hurt our behinds so we moved to the wood bottom of the trailor thing and that wasn't much better. Melissa lost her shoe at one point. Before we even got on Ali and I had the great idea to run and get some pop before...we get half way there and they start leaving without us. We sprint and get a coke, run back, jump on and Ali opens her pop not realizing the fact that it's been shaken up to high heaven and back. We tried the whole tapping thing but to no prevail.......hehe it was FUNNY! Ummm Anthony was baa'ing like a sheep at this little girl and she goes "where's the sheep mama?!" Lol it was funny. He started cluckin like a chicken too. We get off and go play some volleyball....little bit of badmitten....later on played some frisbee....Ali and I were vicious when it came to that game...but Alison was the worst. As Anthony described "she's like a little blue blur" racing around snatching up the frisbee...freaky! lol. Anthony and I pushed this 1200 pound hay marshmellow thing when Melissa and Alison went on one of the many frequent drink runs....Then dusk came about. We all settled down to watch the movie after a bit of a few hay/grass fights. There were three bales...Melissa, Alison, then me, while Anthony climbed a tree lol. We were watching the Three Stooges episode about plumbers which turned out to be about cross dressing Curly as an opera singer...lol. Then halfway through we get a blanket to put under us since the hay was killing our skin lol. Anthony then jumps down claiming the tree was uncomfortable and so Ali and I scooted over so he could fit....Four people on three bales lol. Funny stuff. We had another hay fight then and it was funny. Then they threw on another movie called Clockwise. It was like some bad Brittish film. Pretty dumb lookin lol. Yeah...it was great fun. Then 10 o'clock rolled aorund and Anthony and I set off four homesteads. I dropped him off and then I went home a mess from all the hay and grass and dust and dirt appauling my mother when I walked in the door lol. Now I'm going to bed now so I will talk to ya'll laterz =)

      Don't ask where the title came from. Wait...actually that was a song Ali was singing on our hike today with Anton and Brian lol. Anyways. We woke up at six fifteen....well...rolled around at six fifteen. Got to my house at seven where I showered while she continued sleeping lol. Then we get our hair french braided to match! So cute! Then after that we go and call Anton to see if he thinks we should call Brian as early as it was (eight o'clock). He said go for it....lol. So we did and Brian was awake...I think lol. Which was good...didn't wanna wake him up. He decided he WOULD go along lol. Hehehe I'm so persuading. We pick up Anton and blast him with She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy and Man I Feel Like a Woman. Lol it was great! Hehe...sweet sweet revenge. Then Brian gets into the car and we have the music on low. When he gets in we blast Man I Feel Like A Woman loud and both the guys look at us in terror! Hehe. Then I throw in Avril LaVinge and Anthony looks like he's going to strangle me right then and there! Lol. Hehe. Anyways...go to Subway and then on to Carbonato River! We take an alternate trail that takes us up to this lake that we never got to. All along the way we're all tripping as usual. This one point Ali and I decide to "check out the creek" and go off trail with the guys way behind us. They pass us and go way ahead. We try and catch up...but couldn't until a while later. We got a lil freaked out but lol oh well. Anthony was all confused thinking we were in fact extremely far ahead and showed up from behind. He ended up throwing his backpack at a tree lol. It was great fun. Then we were all walkin along and eventually stopped for lunch. The whole time Ali and I were cracking up. There was also this one really cool rock that we stayed on for awhile at the beginning of the trail that we waited for the guys on. It was a fun rock. We ate teryaki beef jerky lol it was funny. Anyways....we ate lunch at another set of rocks. Anthony climbed up this huge rock and Brian thought he'd get smart and trudge on ahead..not realizing we were stopping to eat. He gets all the way up this hill and didn't wanna come back I guess cus he didn't come down. But he ate his lunch earlier so its all good lol. After we were through eating and Ali and I were done bouncing our shoes off the rock, we trudged on. This is when we got REALLY FAR BEHIND the guys...we were pacing ourselves lol...not to mention laughing the entire way! LOL. I love it how Anthony the whole hike was all "we're almost there." five mor miles later "only five more miles...we're almost there." I wanted to deck him one. Lol. Then we finally get to the top after 20 minutes of being behind the guys and picking flowers and changing shirts lol. That was funny! Hope nobody saw that...haha too bad the guys were all the way up ahead otherwise they woulda gotten a show....good things come to those who WAIT FOR US!!!! Lol. haha. We get to the top and then turn around and RUN down the hill...Brian fell off the ledge from rocks and dirt just flew from under my feet and I was goin down. Thank God Anthony caught my arm lol. Smart ol me. Fell about three more times cuz my tennis shoes kept slipping off. Then I almost lost my teeth when I nearly fell this one time...almost ate a rock for cripes sake! lol. We get back in the car and Brian is no where to be found. He was WAY WAY WAY back there cuz he was having difficulty walking and none of us could slow down. We waited in the car for him though. Took em all home and then I went to the dump with my dad. Had to carry this HUGE freezer....lol very heavy. Then we went and got Burger King...yum...NOT. Come home...sit around. Anton called a few times and I'm picking up him to go to Alison's party tommorow....interesting. Oh and on the ride home to take Anton home I learned some VERY interesting information lol. That's all! BuHbYeS

        Hey Hey Hey....today was interesting. Sat around on my butt.......yeah lol. Ali got a cat and named it Chai...like the tea lol. It was cute! I helped her name it I feel so proud! I'm currently "on location" at her house right now. I was frantically trying to get a hold of Brian to explain things but he's not on...so he's not going on the hike. Sad. I tried though. Anyways..yeah we had a wee bit of a fight last night. Not too good. Anyways. Ali and I went to Safeway where she brought the cat in with her. Funny stuff! We saw Josh again....nice....lol. Saw another friend from school too. That was cool stuff. Outie for now in case Brian is on and sees this...in which he should get on AIM so i can explain lol. Bye!

      Today not too much happened. Woke up...helped mom with a couple of boxes...that was great fun. They were ReAlLy heavy!!! lol. Almost fell backwards going up the flight of twelve stairs a couple of times. It was quite comical if I do say so myself. Waited for my father to get home when we mosied on over to my grandma's house to leave a "good impression." You see, my uncle Coleman is in town and my family and him don't really see eye to eye lets say...lol. We all just don't really have a lot in common. Let's just say that was the longest hour and a half I've ever been through. The Village doesn't count because that was the longest two hours I've ever been through lol. At least there were no magic rocks here...just lots of knats...flying everywhere....nasty little suckers lol. Yeah ummm...drove by the new house a few times.....people their already know we're psychos because of how many times we drive by in a day lol. Then we went to Safeway to pick up some more groceries. Saw Josh there...that was fun. Lookin good. LOL yeah....umm... that's pretty much it. Gonna go and do somethin now. Don't know what. Lol. I'm outie...!

      Today I didn't do much until Alison called at 3:30. Well...I did go and buy some groceries for my mom around 11 and got whistled at by a bunch of truck drivers...it was funny. We also went to the cemetery to pay my grandfather a visit. He had nasty lookin flowers and so we had to drive to the QFC to get him some new ones. I wouldn't let mom leave until we bought him some pink ones cuz pink rocks! lol. We put those there and left for home. Hit Rite Aid on the way and picked me up some Got2B you hair mousse which is the "kinky" type lol. It's for people with curls...it elaborates them more...cool stuff! lol. It gets bigger when you put it in your hand...like the foam grows lol it's cool. I'm so easily amused. Lol. Then 3:30 comes around and Ali comes on over...well I pick her up and she's still runnin around like a fruit cake (gonna get kicked for that one) complaining about her hair. Lol. While she finished...I sat there mocking her as usual. Then she had an interesting time with a "shirt" of hers. I'd write more but I'd probably get in trouble lol. Lets just say she left the house with one...got on 212th with another lol. We rode around like idiots...did some shopping for my mom and bought a bannana creme pie. Good stuff. Brought that stuff home...set out to McDonalds...got some grub...more like maggots between bread...which is why I got McNuggets lol. Then came home...ate...set back out again. Drove around aimlessly. Ended up in Cumberland...then decided to turn around lol. Went around lookin for guys...found a few...found more in Safeway then on the road lol. Yeah...that's pretty much it! She's out gettin a kitten now and I have no clue what it looks like lol. It's gonna be kewl. Haven't heard from the guys yet on the whole hiking thing...but they'll come around..i think....never know with them males....lol....outies for now so buh byes.

      I hiked in the woods today with Brian and Anthony. We went to Carbonado River Trail which was FUN FUN FUN!!! We were a hikin' and I was a....fallin everywhere!!! Lol. What do you expect with tennis shoes that are two years old and no traction...at least I didn't acctually FALL....It was more like tripping lol. At least I wasn't the only one, Anthony and Brian both had their fair shares of interesting falls. Speaking of falls...we saw the Alice Falls I guess...cool cool. Saw lots of water....and rocks....and trees...and rocks....and trees.....and did I mention dirt? No? Well there was lots of dirt...and rocks...don't think I mentioned those. Yeah...We ate lunch when we were like only a half a mile away from the glacier, but afterwards we turned back. Anthony had this weird tube that went into his water that he drank out of that made him look like he was uh..."leaking" everywhere lol if you catch my drift. Ha...Brian and I had the brains to freeze our water so it would last longer...only problem is when you really wanted some it was in frozen form....not good. I believe Brian yelled "melt already" or something of that manner to his water along the trail lol. They all bought subway sandwiches and I made my own. Brian was taking pictures of EVERYTHING....sticks...water...sticks....lol it was funny. Then we were on this suspention bridge thing and Anthony kept shaking it and pissing Brian off because he was trying to take advantage of a Kodak Moment...lol. Umm...they pissed me off a few times...I was actually mad most of the time and not kidding...but then I took off and went for the car...originally mad but then in my time alone got over it and let them catch up...well...Anthony caught up...dunno where Brian went lol. He caught up also. You can't blame me for getting mad! We saw this weight limit sign for trucks and they go "Oooh....remember the comment at the fair?" "yeah, better watch it." That pissed me off...Then Anthony was singing the Witch is Dead song off of Wizard of Oz and Brian says "No she's not...she's right here." THAT made me peeved....But now that I think of it, it was pretty funny. Just dealing with the rest of the crap given to me during that day made me a little pissed at the time lol. OOO well...I think Brian was pissed off at me in the end anyways...wasn't acting all that cheery...If he was I didn't mean it...It was all good fun. HE WAS DISHING HIS CRAP! HE CAN MOST CERTAINLY TAKE MINE! LOL.  Then I take the cheery chaps home and call up Alison Murray despite my last blog...that was written in sheer fury. Lol. We hung out at her house and are planning on hiking this Saturday again. We got a hold of Anthony and he'll see if he can and I was gonna call Brain but I figured he wouldn't wanna be bugged...so if he reads this he can let me know =)! That'd be great! And he should come....who else is going to dish out all the sarcastic remarks and pretend to know how to read the "crappy map?" lol. AnYwAyZ we played this old game that Alison's dad has....it's pretty fun... I won again...second time playing lol. It was great. Well I'm outie and goin to go to bed now so buh byes!

      Today was a sucky day...really sucky day. It started off okay, Ali and I were supposed to go and hang out today because her babysitting job was cancelled for that day. I wait and wait for her to call me back for when her chores were done. She calls at two o'clock like choking up or something saying she can't come over cuz her mom changed her mind. This is a usual thing, but her voice caused me to ask her "why?" and she says she got into a lil fight with her mom or she said she had an outburst that was of the tone of voice more stern than usual...making her mother mad. This has happened before...but her tone of voice still had me suspicious. Her next line was "well...that's not all but its not important." That right there signaled the whole "oh geeze...what now? It's gotta be bad." She wouldnt' tell me at first, but I forced it out of her. "Well...my mom is back to the whole 'you're a bad influence thing." I was like great....that's just great....what did I DO NOW?! Honestly!!!!! What did I do?! Then she says "we can't hang out together either....unless its at my house." That was the breaking point. Oh my goodness...what have I done?! What have I done wrong? Is it because I don't go to their church? Is it what I wear? Is it because of how I talk? For all I know it could be because I associate with guys. I don't understand it....I mean we're best friends and I just don't understand it. I hate this. I'm so pissed off right now. I mean she says we can hang out at her house but I don't want to go to her house right now. I mean...while I'm there her mother will probably be just there marking me down for stupid things I say or do that have NOTHING to do with being a bad influence. I'd feel like I'm constantly being judged by someone who doesn't have the right. It's not fair...I get good grades...I don't get into trouble...I don't do drugs or drink or any crap that parents should be worried about their children hanging out with so WHAT'S THE DEAL?! Ugh. That's when I called Brain cuz he was the only person I could think of at the time and he prolly didn't wanna hear it anyways. Ahhhhhhh life SUCKS right now and I just ah....I'm gonna stop writing now so I'm out......Oh..brighter side...we bout a house...whoop freakin doo....see? I'm too pissed off to be excited about purchasing a new house and start over. Hopefully my mood will change by tommrow....when I go for my hike with Brian and Anthony...hopefully they're parents don't think I'm a bad influence on THEM too...

      Here I am sitting here singing to Lonestar's "Simple as That" (Country song by the way) at six thirty and figure...what the heck...nothin else exciting is gonna happen today so I'll just write my blog lol. So...this morning wake up...take a shower...and go outside to pick apples lol. In the meantime I'm calling Brian to see if we can get Anthony and Ali and us to all go hiking or something this week since it's gonna be nice out I think lol. He laughs at me the entire time saying I sounded like I was hyperventalating or something....all I was doing was throwing bad apples over the fence and trying to reach ones that were too high lol. I tripped over one of them too and that was interesting. Go in and Jaclyn called...wants to come and pick me up for coffee. Do I ever turn down a Starbucks run? No lol. So I run and have my mom put my hair up in a french braid (I looked like a farm hand but at least it was outta my face) and get done right in time to go with her. We go and I get my vanilla creme frappachino lol. SO GOOD! Before that I showed her where our new house might be lol. There was a park next to it and Jaclyn wanted to go on the swings...so after coffee we swung for like 20 minutes. My hands got so numb I don't know how I used to do that hours on end. It was a nice time to remember the old school days lol. Get home...had to do some grocery shopping at QFC. Sat around on my butt...did nothin but make my butt get larger lol jp. Ummm....called Alison and we acted like idiots as usual lol. Yeah....well thats about it for now..my day was boring...SAD! Lol. OuTiEs! Oh yeah...Brian and Anthony and I are going hiking at 9 a.m. at Carbanao River on Tuesday...fun stuff! Now I'm really outies! I wish Ali could go but she babysits! Sad...buh bye!

      Today I hung out with my best buddy Ali. I was supposed to call her up around 7:30...8 o'clock to wake her up cuz she had some chores...forgot...and fat chance me waking up that early for no apparent reason. Lol. I was up but too lazy to move the six feet to the phone. Anyway, I get up and about and call her around 10:30. She says "oh, I'll be ready by 11:15..but you should show up at 11:30" Ali is ALWAYS late...so we figured "pretending" that I would show up at 11:15 and not show up til 11:30 would make her on time...(if that made ANY sense at all lol) We were WRONG! I left at 11:25 cuz it takes about five minutes to get to her house. Two minutes down the road my mom calls and tells me that she had called and was not ready, but to go ahead to her house anyways...Figures....we FINALLY leave her house at 12. When I was there she was still half in her pajamas lol. Anyways...we mosie on over to the South Hill Mall...of which Ali has no idea where is. Lol. I swear...she has no clue where she is city wise...lol but she's still cool...just clueless (I'm gonna get killed for that remark). Anways, we go and eat lunch at the China Gourmet thing that has chicken that's really really really good. We had a hard time keeping the food in our mouths lol. Oh well. We got some Orange Julius's after that. She got some raspberry thing that tasted like crap and then I got strawberry which was yummy of course! Lol. We go into the Coach Corner or whatever off beat Hallmark store is and looking for beads to cover the doorway that will connect the two rooms because there isn't any way in high heaven that I am going to fit all of my crap in one of those tiny rooms lol. After we're done there, we mosie on over to the American Eagle and buy some shirts...2 at the price of $12.50 lol. They're so cute! Mine is blue and hers is green! So cute So cute...then I ran outta money. Well...I had six bucks left, but I still needed to find SOMETHING for my nephews birthday present lol. We drove back over to Bonney Lake to the Walmart because Ali had to return a certain lingere of a member of her families...giving her $10 free to spend lol. I realized at that moment...Walmart....seven year old's birthday present in need of finding...limited funds....PERFECT! He wouldn't care the price...just what it was lol. I ended up getting him a replica of a motercycle approximately two inches high and three and a half inches long, and I got him two matchbox cars... a Lotus Elise and the Batmobile. Then I got him two candy things...Runts and Zours. We then make our way towards the door to leave. I'm walking towards the exit door...the one marked EXIT in red...and Alison is going towards the Entrance. I go "where are you going?" she says "Well...that one says exit." She was entirely serious...I stare at her and go "yeah...since we are EXITING the store...we use the EXIT door." She sits there mortified and busts into laughter and we both were hysterical for the next ten minutes at least. Seriously, this is her new all time low lol. On the way out we decide we'll go to Starbucks...I had run out of cash by this time but she was nice and bought me mine...besides, it was technically her mom's ten bucks...not her own, so she wasn't losing out on it lol. We walk in and who do we see? Mr. Lightbody....I was ready to run away screaming, but he had already caught me in his sights. I went "hey...Mr. Lightbody..." and he bursts out " I just look at him like "okay...." since when was it illegal to go to a coffee place OUTSIDE of your hometown? Honestly...I'm not going to wait the whole time it takes to go the way to Enumclaw from Bonney Lake to get coffee in town when I want it now and it's right there lol. He asked me a few questions about my summer and I said as little of words as I possibly had to. We "made haste" to get out of there. Leave and get to my house at about 3 and follow my parents to the new house so I could show Ali. She thinks it's okay...just REALLY small compared to what we have. It'll do....I guess lol. So...from there we're off to Des Moines to give my little nephew his gift. Along the way I yell "probable hottie at six o'clock...about face in five...four...three...two...one" and Alison turns around all causual like and starts to giggle. "Hottie confirmed?" "yeah...." Lol. We did this the whole way basically from here to Des Moines. There was this one dude that was eating peanuts and Mountain Dew that was TOTALLY checking us out on highway...but we were unfortunately jail bait lol. Anyways...we arrive to their apartment and give Mikey his gifts. That boy has a fetish with shirts...'watermelons'/'puffers' really...lol...He did somethign to annoy me and I was in the middle of giving him as he calls it "an atomic wedgie" and he grabs my shirt! That made me give him the all time wedgie that I am pretty sure he had much trouble getting out lol. We ate cake and icecream which was pretty good. We headed on out at about 6 o'clock because we were on our way to see Little Black Book in Auburn. As we're coming down the stairs leaving the apartments, this drunk idiot was behind us. We get outside and he yells "hello!" I turn back and so does Ali and we just go "....hey" and walk a little faster. He hollers "I live on the second floor...do you wanna make out?" His friends that live on the second floor with him are yelling "He's house broken..." and all this crap like that so we are basically on the verge of running to my car, lock the doors, throw it in reverse and head on outta there. What a bunch of idiots! Lol. Scary stuff. We head on over to the Auburn Walmart because it had a bank inside it so I could take out $20 bucks for the movie. We also got some food to smuggle into the theatre there. We got two Vanilla Cokes, Twizzlers, Almond Joy, Beef Jerky, and these other things that I don't know what they were lol. We drive on over to the theatre and get our tickets and go sit down. The movie was so sad/good/funny lol. When it was over we leave and she sees her suppossed ex cousin...don't exactly know how that works...but then she realizes she forgot her sunglasses in the theatre. She was too chicken so I go in and try to frantically find them in the dark. The theatre guy was kind enough to turn on the lights and helped me look...but no luck. We searched everywhere in the surrounding area and there were no glasses. Sad. Lol. We are then all the way home and passing theatre she goes "dare me to scream out the window?" I look at her like she's an idiot and said "knock yourself out...but do it when we're in front of people" so she did it...I was in tears. Then I am driving along and she yells "go faster" and starts "rowing the car." She's acting like we're in a boat with her imaginary oar and people were looking at her like she was a retard...me included! lol. Then we're on the freeway and I tell her to yell woo out the window. She tries but sounded like a boy going through puberty...all cracked up in the voice lol it was great. She was going psychotic after that and boy, I learned the hard way but NEVER give her twizzlers lol. Yeah...that's pretty much it! Lol. Chelsea over and OuTie!

      Okay...The Village is the STUPIDEST MOVIE IN HISTORY!!!!!!!!! There aren't any movies bad enough to even compare to how much it sucked!!! It had NO plot, everything that could possibly develop into a plot were contradicted with "farse" information lol. To tip it WAY over the side, it had the line "we've got our magic rocks to save us." If a movie EVER says anything like that, it's a failure right then. Brian was about to choke on his popcorn from that lol it was GREAT! Yeah. He drove there with his mama and met me there. He needs to put in that extra driving time I guess. He didn't have his hat today! Lol sad I couldn't steal it just playin. Anyways, we mosie on over to the mall and this dude goes "hey can I ask you to do a survey on a few new movies we got?" Brian sits there like a deer caught in headlights....honestly, I figured he'd say something witty so I was waiting....got nothin. So I just go "no thanks...we gotta go." Lol. So much for Mr. Wit....lol anyways, then the dude asks us "oh...how old are you?" I tell him we're sixteen and he leaves us alone. Brian seemed to think it was because he realized we were jail bait. I'm sure the dude was sad since he was eyein' Brian and all LOL. Then we randomly walked around the mall which was great fun. Umm...then we drive home and Brian makes fun of my driving skills as usual....him being the one to talk...he doesn't even have his license yet! LOL! We BS around my house for like an hour...I think he was having a more enjoyable time with the dog over me...lol. Talking to the dog saying "we don't like her do we?" thanks...I feel so loved. Took him home at 3:40....then we went on over to the house we're putting an offer on as of now. It's okay...rooms are tiny, but I get two of em anyways....cuz goin from what I got to littleness is OBSERD! All of my crap wouldn't even fit in one of those room lol. It was okay though. We got some teryaki afterwards...and now I'm here...trying to create a funfilled day for tommorow...possibly lol. Yeah....now I'm gonna go chill out...write some emails....look for some stuff...Alison and I decided something too...After high school, we're both going to Central Washington University (maybe) and being rommies...this summer taking a few classes at Green River ( fun ones ) just for the heck of it lol like swing dancing or somethin LOL JP. Then we're gonna go get jobs together and earn money to go to college in the first place and it'll be so much fun!!!! Lol...just some ideas we had!!!! hehe....ttul! Buh byes

      Didn't do much today....except get stalked by the same guy AGAIN!!!! Ahh!!! I was going to the Exxon station and he passes me in the other lane...like we're going opposite directions. I assumed he was going to work in Bonney Lake, so I go on my merry way. I continue on to the BECU to deposit/withdraw some money for my mama...ever since I got my license I get to do all the odd jobs LOL. I start walking over to the machine and HE PULLS INTO THE PARKING LOT. I'm like "okay...maybe he was getting groceries at QFC...no big deal." I'm just trying to hurry so I don't have to have a confrontation with him....ewe...lol. So then, I go and rush over to my car...not looking in his general direction. I turn on the car and start to pull out. Symotaniously, he does the same. I hurry up and try to get to the exit and he's right behind me. I avoided looking in the rear view mirror so I wouldn't have to see his face. I pull out left, he goes straight. I'm at the Buds N Blooms intersection and he goes across the road and looks at me and ahh! Eye contact...not a good thing lol. Scary facial expression.....no smile...just stare...AHH! LOL. Other than that...nothin happened today. Went back to Des Moines to unload some cardboard for my brother with my dad. We went to Wendys...again....lol. Got one of their salads that suck lol. Umm... drove home and mom says she found a house she liked...dad went with her to see it and it might be a winner. It's out by the Texaco Station area....by the Chinook apartments I guess. I don't care where...as long as my room isn't microscopic! Lol. Well thats pretty much it. Going to go to the movies with Brian tommorow, we're gonna see The Village. Then we're gonna try and get Alison M and Anton to get together sometime this weekend or early next week so we can all hang out and do somethin... Dunno what. Anton isn't back from Idaho yet anyway. Mmmkay..that's about it so Curly Q over and OUTIE!

      I am homeless!!!!! Our house is offically sold and we have to be outta here in 19 days....we have no where to go. We're frantically looking for a house, but there still is the whole closing time if we bought a house and extra moving time and AH! I don't know what we're going to do. This is nuts. I mean, it has finally hit me. I've spent 7 years of my life here...wait...more. Ahh...it just feels like forever. This is home....I used to live in Kent, but I don't even really remember that house that much. I mean, I do, but not like this house. This house is different. I don't know....certain people ar probably going "here goes the emotional wreck" agian...but I'm serious. This is huge! A lot of things happpened to me while being here at this house. I mean, I turned 16 here, got my first car here, went to high school here, got my first boyfriend here, etc. It's just full of so many memories. It's hard........so hard......Things are so unpredictable now. I have no clue what is going on or what is happening. All I know is my dad brought home a ton of boxes and we've been starting to pack. Slowly, all of our stuff is being put away...then going to be carried out of my home...the one place I feel totally safe and entirely secure...without that...what is there? Nothing...Just a pile of stuff in boxes.

      Today I worked...all day. From 9 to 12 then from 4 to seven...so half the day. I had a meeting at the school between each of the times. My grandma is building a rock/brick wall. I was using the pick ax to hack away at the hill side. That was fun. Buildin up some real muscle now. I swear, out of all my cousins that are guys,  I'm the one down there helping her with the wall! Seriously, it's crazy. Oh wells! Anywho....I left there at about 12 so I could go home and take a shower to get ready for my big meeting with Smith and the prez...Rachel. It was boring...as usual. Basically we just got together and told how our summers went. That was fun. Then we had a meeting at 2:30 with these two women who are in charge of Hornet Brother Sister/Hornet Days. They have never done this before so Rachel and I were considered the pro's at it. I've done this for my second year now and her third so we know how it goes. lol. Then I go and get this huge list with like 50 people on it to call and remind them of certain meetings throughout the rest of August...that's great. Get home...head on back over to grandma's and help her finish up part of the wall. Kept hitting termite nests or red ants or somethin...kept goin up my pants. Have a few marks from em...those lil suckers sure can bite. Anyways...then she got the tractor stuck so I had to push her out. That was interesting. Got home...took a shower. Trying to keep everything clean and orderly for the inspection people to come. Was gonna hang out with Brian, but he's got stuff to do so now I get to go do somethin...maybe I'll have grandma let me help her tommorow instead of Thursday, cus I moved it to Thurday because I thought that I was going to do something more exciting. Alas...no. Well I'm gonna go...I'm sore as it is...tommorow is gonna be interesting. Over and out.

      Today...Alison Murray came over. We had our lil friendship ritual of making cookie dough, taking a giant spoonful of it, and eating it. IN ONE BITE. I did it no problem, cuz I have a big mouth. She ended up spitting cookie dough all over the floor and sink and it was nasty...It was all over her face it was great. Earlier in the day we went to Safeway to pick up some flour, brown sugar, and orange juice. We're in line to pay for it and we notice this dudes shirt. On it are a bunch of fruit names...and above are the types of boobs that go with it. Cranberrys....watermelons...nasty stuff lol. We started cracking up and he says "are you laughing at my shirt," we say "yeah" lol it was funny. You had to have been there. Lets see...nuthin else really. Gotta call from Smith sayin we got an official meeting tommorow at 1 p.m. after I work for my grandma. That's about it....so yeah...fill ya in laters!

      Today...I skied...again lol. It was SO much fun. I figured I was gonna die because I was so sore, but I was having a total BLAST! I learned how to jump the wake which was wicked awesome...wicked awesome? What was that? Oh geeze...I'm going insane...Too much water to the brain I tell ya lol. Anyways, we were skiing appy go lucky, I was the last to go and we were gonna head in. All of a sudden the boat stopps. I slowly sink into the water...about 1.5 feet then I touch the bottom....not good. I figured that's why my dad stopped the boat...then I noticed they weren't coming back for me...oh crap. This can't be good. So I start to swim....I don't even know if you could call it swimming, more like reach and pulling with one arm while grasping the lone waterski. Lol. The boat is slowly drifting further and further away throughout this whole ordeal mind you. Lol. I get up to the boat and go around to get in and something is terribly wrong....something is out of place....THE PROP WAS GONE!!!!! There was a rock in the middle of the lake and my dad hit it....so we had to get towed in. They tow us to the launching docks, but couldn't pull us all the way in cuz it's not humanly possible...well boatily possible but that's not a word. Oh well. So my brother Justin grabs the bow line and jumps into the water and lunges up onto the dock to pull in the boat. My dad jumped onto the dock which to most would SEEM humanly impossible...lol but he floats if he fell so its all good. I'm just kiddin...I love my daddy lol. Anyways, so the boat is sitting perpendicular to the two docks...the stern no where in reach to my dad and I couldn't throw the line in that far. I felt a daring streak in me after all the stunts I had pulled today (going outside the wake nearly twice as fast as the boat, jumping wakes, pulling weird stunts, lol.) So...I jumped into the water with the stern line...I figured it was gonna be about oh, five feet deep or so, so I just slid in....I come to realize it was about eight and I can't swim so I just looked like a fish out of water...lol....fish...water...lake...stupid anyways...So I throw the line up to my dad and I TRY to get up on the dock...My brother mind you is MUCH more athletic than I am and has MUCH more upper body strength, so he popped up just fine. My arms were dead from skiing ten minutes earlier, and I probably looked real funny floppin myself over the edge of the dock onto it. It was either that or becoming a dock and boat sandwich, with me as the middle of it. NOT GOOD. Lol. Anyways....then we mosie on home and clean up the boat...kill a few bees that were buggin us. I discover I am yet again burnt to a crisp...what else is new? If they had a skin donation service the peelings I have could probably keep them well stocked for a year. Ahh...pain. Lol. Then mom comes in at 8 going "do you wanna go to Walfart in Auburn with me?" Arg..."Only if I CAN DRIVE." My mom the whole way was going "this is too slow..." IT WAS THE SPEED LIMIT!!!!!! She's freaking crazy! Then we were next to this guy that was merging, I figure if I let him in she'd say "why did you do that, you coulda went past him," so I sped past him and she said I was stupid! What her deal is, I dunno...I never get a good read on that woman. Lol. But we love her too...HAHAHA Anyways....I'm tired and sore and burning so I'm going to slowly inch to bed...six feet is so far right now....I'll prolly get there in about 2 hours. Oh, but I did call Brian to see if he wanted to go to a movie when he gets back from his grandma's and his up close and personal physical.....touchy feely those doctors are LOL. What if he got a woman?! LOL he'd be happy then I'm sure....lol. I'm so mean. Oh well...he'll survive...has so far. If he really didn't like my meaness, I'm sure he'd yell at me or somethin by now....maybe...lol or he's too afraid of me one of the two lol. Well I'm goin to bed NOW so BYE!
