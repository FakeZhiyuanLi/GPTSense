      Right.  So I haven't gotten all that much reponse for my Apple Cup email.  I thought I'd start a new thread here, to see if I can drum up some more support.  Coug side tix are all but sold out already, and as of the last thing I heard, the Fuskie side has around 3000 left.  The game should be fun, not to mention hangin out in Pullman again.  So what do ya think?  I'm planning on heading over Friday morning and spending the day in and around campus, then Saturday hit the game.  The longer we wait the less likely we'll be able to get hotel rooms or tickets.  Just something to think about.  Of course, if you wanna just stay home, thats OK too.  I'd just really like to see one of these games.

      FOR REDHOOK MOVIE NIGHTS, EVERYONE IS WELCOME TO MEET AT THE NEVE RESIDENCE. PARK ALONG THE TOP OF THE STREET, SO NO ONE IS ON THE SIDEWALK & SO LARRY CAN PARK IN HIS SPOT WHEN HE COMES HOME TO TAKE CARE OF THE DOGGIES. 5:30 IS GO TIME, IF YOU ARE NOT THERE BY 5:30 PLAN ON DRIVING YOURSELF.

      The Buick is finally done.  KC Martin agreed to pay me 500 bucks on the damn thing.  I'm taking a serious soaking, but what can ya do?  I'm screwed no matter which way I cut it, so I'm going to cut my losses and run.  Thanks for everyone's help with rides, advice, and just support as I waded my way through this fiasco.  Bye bye Pimp-Daddy, it was fun while it lasted.  -Scott

      Well, according to the calender, its time for RHMN (easy!).  I've never been to one, so I'm looking forward to it mucho.    Whats the best way to go?  Meet up and car pool?  What do we need to bring?  This is going to kick so much ass.  -Scott

      Hey everyone!  The calender is really flushing out!  Thanks B for filling in your schedule.  I've put the Coug games up on the board (and only a couple errors for Ben-Wa to fix).  And I've started filling in birthdays as I know 'em.  Make sure your birthday is on there, as well as any you know thats missing.    Looks like Thursday we'll be hitting the RedHook Movie night!  My first ever!  But that is the subject of a whole new post.  -Scott

      Yo dudes.  Just wanted to see what was up for Monday night.  I'm thinking that perhaps we can chizzill at Bri-Guys, since he said he'd prolly like to hang out, but since his back has made him gimpy, perhaps he should stay home on his couch.  Nothin too strenuous.  Plus, we can get him dinner, and put it just out of his reach...hehe...wait, thats mean.  Anyway, thought I'd throw that out there.  I need to stop by Julie's and drop off goodies for the little dude getting heart surgery.  And I still need to get the hooptie (maybe someone can help me?...please?)    Busy busy!

      Just curious if our daily email crew would rather use this for or daily chit-chat, or just use this for making things happen?  I have a feeling that if we use this for our daily ramblings, things will get very crowded.  Unless we stick to the COMMENTS under each heading.   What do you think?

      Ok, so the main page is having some kind of issue with the sidebar.....And Scott is having some kind of issue with empty space at the end of his posts.&nbsp; I'm working on the sidebar thing, as far as Scott's problem.&nbsp; I dunno what's causing that.

      So I was wondering if we should continue to use a new Post for each comment, or if we should use the main posts as topics and anyone who wants to respond to it to use comments? Any thoughts?

      Welcome to the "Blog" (whatever the hell that is.)&nbsp; Here is the first attempt at setting up some kind of organizational website for us to come together as a group and make plans...to........come together...........as a group. &nbsp; If this doesn't turn out to be useful, F it.&nbsp; It didn't cost anything. &nbsp; Ben-Wa
