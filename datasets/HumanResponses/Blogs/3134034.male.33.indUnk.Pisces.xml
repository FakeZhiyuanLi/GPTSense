      Yeah right... silence is golden, most Indonesians are in to that phrase.   It was not unusual to see Indonesian pupils staring at their teachers with those big black eyes when the teacher giving questions. I don't know whether the symptom still remains nowadays, but that fact happened in my school era. Was it because we loved that phrase that much?   During my time in Europe I got a very valuable experience to get into touch with people from four corners of the world. There I could see more examples of Indonesians' attachment to the phrase. Some of us, ofcourse, were not that silent but if one had compared us with students from other parts of the world, it would have been apparent that we love "gold". I, myself, even found those friends too straightforward, too fussy. The impression died down in time, more understanding came about once I got along with them. They were not fussy, they were not too straighforward, not too noisy. They knew that people must talk to be heard.   I do think that it is not wrong at all to express the things we know, it is not wrong to admit that we don't know by simply asking question, it is right to think outloud!   Let other people know that we exist.  Salam.

      A mother, working hour: 08.00 - 16.00. Wakes up: 05.30, leaves home to work: 06.30, arrives at home: 20.00  She has to wake up very early, facing problems in the office as much as their opposite sex has, struggling with/against their opposite sex to find a spot in bus, gets home to find that her husband is already there with flat face, oblivious, no welcome kiss is received, only question,"Why so late?"  The husband sees her woman arriving home from work, late.  He knows she is working, he realizes how busy she is,  he does not want to see her suffering from working,  he wants her to be with their children home, he needs her to work,  he can easily give her woman a welcome kiss to wipe the exhaustion away; he does not do it.  He wants his lover to be there when he comes home, welcoming him along with their children in the front door, smiling.  She wants to welcome his man at home, kiss him to ease away all the tiredness. They can not do those simple things.  or can they?  (TO ALL WORKING MOTHER IN THE UNIVERSE, SALUTE...!)

      This word has been nagging me since morning. LOVE.  Do we need a reason to love or be loved?  Reason is in a mind's domain while love is in feeling. I don't think one can mix those two.   If you feel like it, love... No reasons needed.  Have a great weekend dear browser.

      Why do I start to hear like I loath police? Not that I know of. I like the force, I even once hoped to be a policeman, myself, before I gave the dream up due to my physical limitation. So If I mention police to often, it is just coincidence :D

      Last night I wrote a new record, covering a road of around 40 km long in a total of 5 (FIVE) f*****g hours in a heavy rain...!  To make my mind go wandering further, I finally managed to come across a policeman after 3 hrs, before then? zip, nill, nada. I mean, have you ever wondered, how we always come across something when we least need it? I only met policemen twice last night; three hours after I started my 5 hours drive and in queue before a gas station. I was stuck in a long line when I heard this siren from a police patrol car. At last! safe... (that was my thought when I heard the siren) the police would come as a saviour, arrange the line and we could go faster.   Beep..! Wrong answer! They sounded the siren to make way...! for crying outloud. Talking about abuse of power, huh!

      Have you ever been stopped by a police? I mean, it happened when you unintentionally break the law, say, you drove a long when the light was red? Well, I have.   I passed through this limited passenger lane when a police stopped me and asked for my driver's licence (he stopped me because I was the only person in the car while the lane required me to have at least three persons inside). It is not that I did not want to obey that requirement, I simply found it stupid to find two more passengers from the street just to fill my car to be able for it going through few hundreds meter of lane before entering to the toll road. Anyway, the officer checked my licence, took it, gave a ticket to attend the hearing in Central Jakarta Court.   I went to the court two weeks after the predetermined date as I just recovered from the dengue. The officer there told me that my files had been sent to traffic police headquarter, so it was better for me to go there instead. I went there to arrange it.   On the way there by the luxurious busway, courtesy of Bang Yos, I have prepared myself to wait for long hours of uncertainty and other fussy this and that. To my surprise, once I produced my ticket to the officer at the police headquarter, he let me wait only for 15 easy minutes, called up my name, asked me to pay 50.000 rupiah, gave me my driver's licence, and they allowed me to go on with my life.   Did they give me a receipt for the fine? what receipt?  I got my licence, did not have to wait, I can drive my dear old car again. Who cares about the receipt. What receipt?

      That's it. No more tolerance to ignorant fools who think that they can always be whatever they be in every place they set their feet on.  Few months ago, one platoon of presidential guard attacked a police post because one of the military men was warned for using public lane that is dedicated for bus (he was using motorbike). Are military helmets too hot that they melt clear mind? The lane is located in a city, the city is not undersiege or at war, police are supposed to do their job. The attack is full of arrogance and ignorance, in my personal opinion.  I was "trapped" in a crowded toll road with cars standing bumper to bumper (yes, in the city I live in, toll road sometimes is sooo full. the operator said that the users are not paying for the swiftness of traffic, we pay to recover the cost). Then, an ambulance set off its siren to make way. Lo and behold, it was not in emergency situation( I saw that there were only laughing passengers inside). It brouht me to the story about the boy who cried wolf.  I don't like this entry&#*@&$*#*&$()q#

      A little girl, with her twin baby sisters, looked at the crescent last night. She opened her mouth in awe and said,"I wish I dream about the moon tonight".  A crescent shines at night. It's shape is just like a ship, small ship without mast. The ship is floating around starry, saphire blue night sky, sprinkling its glimmer adding colors to the night.  Three little girls rise from their bed, open the room's window and soar to reach the small ship hovering nearby the girls' house. Three little girls in their night outfit (off-colored t-shirts, worn-out shorts) hop in to the ship, smiling, giggling, expecting a night of adventure. On a ship, floating in the starry night sky.  Sleep my babies, sleep....  (Dedicated for my little angels, adapted from "Winken, Blinken, and Nod")

      So the song says.... I heard the song on my way to office this morning with my wife humming it.  You know what? I see that people tend to use whatever they have on hand to forcefully make the world be on their side.  Exhibit one: A housewife hit, iron, spill with hot water and torture phisically and emotionally damage her housemaid after the latter uninentionally broke the former's cup.  Exhibit two: A warlord held a small town of Srebrenicka to a siege, sent the Netherlands' peacekeeping force out, sort out all male inhabitants from the town (disregarding their age and health condition) and then execute all 3,000 of them.  Exhibit three: A citybus driver stopped his bus anywhere at anytime to gather as much passenger as he can, leaving other cars stucked behind it.  Exhibit four: A football player with "fairplay" badge attached on his sleeve, tackled his opponent hard, with a possibility of injuring permanently.  Exhibit four: A band of youngster stopped a car right in the middle of a busy street, sing and play whatever instruments they got to express themselves (they don't really ask for money).  Me, I am still trying my best not to have everything I want. A friend of mine once asked me, what would I ask if a genie popped up and would grant anything I want. My answer was: I want to be able.

      Got fever last night, something went wrong with my digestion system but I brave myself to come to office (I said "come" to office, the word is not identical with "work" )  I start this morning opening emails from my long-time-and-distance friends, some of them really made me laugh my gut off! and you know what? The pain just left....  It is amazing to realize how the most ordinary things in the past was just an ordinary at the time it happened and it turns out to be hillarious and inexplicably extraordinary when we are recalling the event now. Hail to the carriers of "souvenirs from the past" !!! Long live friendship!!!   Here is one of them: http://dengjie.com/temp/bird.swf  urlLink

      Why do we need reason to love or not to love? Can we say that we love a person because he/she deserves it? Can we say that we don't need more love because we had enough?  LOVE IS IN THE AIR not only at present, it is just there for us to inhale, feel, no reason is needed.  Make peace with yourself, and you will feel love.

      I find it very funny about how we can be keeping in touch with our friends; long gone, faraway, and old ones.   True that technology helps us a lot; internet, telephone, even old-fashioned letter mail keep us in touch with our friends. But technology is just one of means, passive, a gun which needs a trigger puller. It is not a hard thing to come up with prove. Do you realize how thick your name cards collection is? How much the telephone numbers' list in your cellphone? So, how often do you contact the person who got those coordinate.... How many of them you called because you need them? How many of them you called because you miss them? - missing is also kind of need, our heart is telling us that it needs something to address - How many of them you called or contacted simply to say HELLO.  Anyway, we keep them in touch. Another way of keeping in touch with the very existence of your friends is dreaming about them. Unlike the "more sophisticated ways" people use nowadays this way of "contacting" is active. Functioning without us asking them to. It popped up when we least expecting. The dream connects us with a friend that we never met for zillion of years, it brings us to a time when we are "still friends". Not only it is self-propelling, the dream is sometimes also induces us to something further; MAKING a "real" contact with our friends; be it calling, sending email, or maybe just thinking about them, remember that we still have them in our heart.  I am quite happy with my recent "disorder"; light-sleeping. It makes me dream a lot, and that opens a huge window of opportunity to see my friends, the one that I don't even remember....(and I still refer to them as friends?)  Salam.

      Main Entry:  cre·a·tion   Pronunciation: krE-'A-sh&n Function: noun 1 : the act of creating; especially : the act of bringing the world into ordered existence 2 : the act of making, inventing, or producing: as a : the act of investing with a new rank or office b : the first representation of a dramatic role 3 : something that is created : as a : WORLD b : creatures singly or in aggregate c : an original work of art d : a new usually striking article of clothing  (Mirriam-Webster online dictionary, 2004)  Yesterday, in my parents' house, I saw with awe how strong the word is. It was the first time for my daughter (and her mother) to make donuts and panada out of dough. Her grandma prepared the dough and afterward they shaped it into those donuts and panada.    When I looked at those little hands of my daughter "playing" with the dough and saw her face, bright with light of content, I can feel how strong the word is. She looked very absorbed in her effort to form that dough into donuts, and once she finished one donut she showed it to me with  veeerry  broad smile. The things also happened to her mother; the smile, the content, the satisfaction. The spectator is not left behind, I feel so happy to see them showing the look in their faces. These all came from the creation of one single cake a.k.a donut.  Perhaps, that is why I love looking at buildings, especially the ones that were made in harmony with their surroundings; temples, palaces, ancient stadiums, houses of Gods. Behind those buildings lies the contented people who built them; their smiles, their happiness of finally finishing what they had started.  I wonder how wide my God's smile is.

      Indonesian folklore world knows mousedeer, a very wellknown cunning little animal that lives in a jungle. It always make it to go through dangers with its bright ideas. It can easily fool its foes, such as crocodiles and tigers. However, in one of occasions, a mousedeer was lured into the darkworld. It stole cucumbers from farmer's farm, and the farmer made it to cath it with yet another cunning idea.  Jakarta is another jungle and in this jungle, mousedeer proves itself as an incumbent winner, as yet. Early this month Jakarta administration just issued a decision letter to "set free"  kancil  (Indonesian word for mousedeer), a minivan cab for passengers, to operate in its busy streets. Each kancil that operates will take place one bajaj (Indian-style-three-wheeler-passenger transport), despite of huge protests from the latter's owners. The owners are supposed to give up their bajaj and take kancil, instead. Kancil is bigger, environmental-friendlier, easier to operate, quieter, and newer.   Owners insist that kancil is much too expensive (almost three folds) and they were not included in decision making process to let kancil out in the street. City administration remains stone-faced (one of its first echelon's official maintains that the administration is very strong now, it can go on doing its policy, though unpopular).  I don't really care which side will come up as a winner. In fact one should just wait and see whether kancil has a stand off with farmers or tigers. At the end of the day, I just want to see people moving cheaply and smoothly from one place to another in this beloved city without having to come accross traffic jams, unlawful acts of motorcycles and buses, and ignorant drivers. We don't mind parking our cars at home as long as we can use public transports in civilized condition. Gosh, I miss Malmoe bus... "Nature gasbus, bra for dig och alla andra."

      Be patient, brothers and sisters, members and fellow sympathizers of Welfare Justice Party (PKS). The party leaders are yet to announce their stance over which presidential candidate will be given their vote. Patience is one thing, but I agree with an opinion that members and sympathizers are not to be kept waiting in vain.   What make the leaders wait that long to vote? I believe that being a full-fledged party PKS elite have formulated ideal criteria on who will be this country's president. So, why taking time? Are they in a process of "cow-purchase" with some candidates? Are they under pressure from "higher" authority? Are they testing members and sympathizers?  PKS "only" gained 7,8 million votes out of two hundred millions, yet this vote is very significant in a share of chances amongst the five candidates. C'mon man, say it, who (s)he is. Your prompt stance, I believe will make a lot more difference now, rather than last minute announcement.

      Several honorable member of Indonesian parliaments just got back from Sounth Korea, they went, as per the house spokesman said, to observe progress of Pertamina's new tanker's building.  In so doing their noble task (watching how public fund is spent by the state's company), the MPs were accompanied by their loving spouses. Understandable; that will close slightest opportunity from stinky parties to distract the MPs with, for example,  opposite sexes lure.   How much is the tanker's worth? millions of US dollars, so the members of parliament were supposed to sleeve up and scrutinize the process to safeguard that huge amount of public money. How much does the visit cost? 150 million rupiah (or around 15.000 USD).   150 million rupiah for 4 days journey;  Day one : arrival in Hongkong at day time, free program, short presentation,  day two : free morning, depart to South Korea, arrive at night,  day three : 30 minutes presentation by dockyard and consultant, free afternoon, prepare to fly back to Jakarta,  Day four : arrival in Jakarta.  150 million rupiah....of course it is much lower than the budgeted 500 million for the visit, but 30 minutes of presentation and short explanation? Somebody please enlighten me with something!

      How can you do that to me?  You really dissapointed us in the last world cup tournament with your first round expulsion. In this "smaller" scope tournament you gave us very high hopes with that 2-1 magic over mighty England but then, what did you offer afterward?  2-2 with the Croats? Big deal. Croatia scored twice, one from that white spot thanks to, again, sloppy mistake by Silvestre and amazing twist from Dado Prso. Wish I had watched magical and much entertaining skills, yet again from Zidane, but no. Two consolations came from own goal and a goal from Trezeguet (with his own hand's help).  Please, please don't let us down next time, show your true value next match against Switzerland.  Regards, Me.

      Jakarta's sway 'Tis just like that of young females' hips Everyone is eager to see or even feel them...  Jakarta, my beloved city, a place where I was born. It is so dynamic, progressive, modern, and... and... it is limping.   Wherever one saw some info featuring my city, one will not fail to see nice buildings, luxury cars passing by on a wide roads, glimmering lamp lights at night, people with optimistic smile in their business dresses.   But wait, lo and behold! Where are those rusty city buses weaving their ways in crowded street? Where are those petit-hell-angel drivers on their motorbikes? Where are small kiosks selling everyting along the street? Where are beggars, street hawkers, street singers? Where are they? Seems that the city administrator's hard work does make it to make the city's problem out of sight, yes, out of sight.   On the other hand, the administrator doesn't even have to sweat to cover pictures of public room from the feature, because? They are simply not there. Jakartans can just marvel on NY's central parks. Jakartans can just dream about sports fields, open space for people to merely sit, read, walk with their children and lovers. People don't have enough room to move about and trained their bodies. People did have a public open room in city center, but they have to make room for royal deer brought down from Presidential Palace in Bogor, the city administrator think that only those animal have the right to enjoy such a beautiful and strategic space.  No wonder, I, the connoisseur of female beauty, will not spend my precious seconds in life to see those young Jakartan female hips, a glance is enough for those untrained physique.

      Law allows no distiction between high officers and common people. That beautiful statement comes from a highly respected Western liberal country, thus not an empty statement. We have witnessed how government officials are brought to justice and prosecuted, there.  What I don't understand is that why the US said that their president is not to be touched by Geneva Convention and International Law? Are they trying to say that he doesn't belong to one of the two? If the US, a prominent sponsor of democracy, hence, rule of law can stand such thing, can allow Abu Ghraib incident to happen, what will happen in other countries, disciples that just start to learn democracy?  No wonder, Lee Kuan Yew is still respected as a hero despite of his long gone history of shouting press' mouth in Singapore, Soeharto is still enjoying his retirement although the world witnessed his action in cruely eliminating communism on his own way.   Scientists can strive their utmost effort to create a powerful machine to move people  at no time, but I still believe, dream is the most powerful machine to move people from one place to another; reality to fantasy.

      Kastrup, Copenhagen, a door to my second encounter with European soil. Already anticipating  a confusion on how to get a bulk of my luggages into a train to Malmoe, I've got to forego a first sensation of riding passenger rail train connecting two countries as Goran, WMU's staff is there, waiting with a WMU banner in his hands.   He asks me to wait as he is supposed to wait some other new students that is due to come, in the SAME flight with me all the way up from Bangkok. There they come, Asians, all look very Indonesian. Once they approach, one of them asks me with strange language (later, Bay told me that he thought I was Philippino and he greeted me in Tagalog).  Goran, my first Swede "contact", helps us with our mountains of bags and drives us to the city where we will be studying for about two years, passing a new bridge that connects Denmark and Sweden, The Oresund Bridge.  I ask a Philippino sits beside me about the names of Philippines' students that are coming, he mentions three out of four. Whispering, he said that he doesn't know one person in front and adds that he refers to the one sitting with Goran as "Sir", adding that it is his first meeting with him. Well, no wonder, Bay is the most senior of all Philippines' coast guards in the batch, he is a Lieutenant Commander.  One hour passes and the car pulls over in front of our hostel. As we pass I manage to see one familiar face on the street, Adrian of Indonesia Port Corporation III, I did not know he is studying at WMU, too.   Goran walk me to my room, brand new room, my room lies at the brand new wing of the hostel. He passes over my keys, first keys, as we are receiving much more keys afterward and soon we are just like many other Malmoe citizens, carrying all our keys around, yes, ALL Malmoe citizens carry their keys around, some brandish the keys out in their chains, some put them in their bags or pockets.  Malmoe, small city with vast variety; ethnics, languages, nations. I soon call this beautiful city a home, after tear drops at my first night.

      I started a new week with one quote I heard from  Nuim Something of ABC, "All generalization is wrong" (Chesterton). I love this quote and I feel that this quote is in line with one of several principles of which I stick my life into: each of us; man, humanbeing, person, lives in our own box.   We live in there, alone, regardless our civil or social status. Forget about our beloved mother, lovers, children; we were born ALONE in the box. We "create our life" (No offense, dear God), around the box. We see things through little holes we make on it. We perceive facts of life based on it. In some cases, some of our box's side is touching that of others', sometimes we even share the side, but still, each one possesses his/her own box.  Who are we to say "OUR opinion..., WE think..., We believe...?" Well, they are gramatically right, but then again I believe that what they really tried to say is "MY opinion, which is also shared with..., I think, and some also think..., I believe and they also do...."   What WE call as "we" is a group of "I s" and "they" is a bunch of "yous". So, no more: Those Sundanese are really fond of sambal, you Irish are a crowd of drunkards.   All generalization is wrong, and why on earth did, again and again, I say "ALL generalization?"   Peace to you all, people with or without same opinion as mine.

      My head is trying to kill me this morning.  I started the morning uneventfully. Waking up, rushing to back-bathroom (family bathroom was occupied), putting on my dull uniform, running to my car, waiting for my daughter preparing herself up for school, driving as fast as police allows to reach my angels' school, my wife's office, and my office in time.  Office, the annual report project was waiting for me and I thought I was ready for battle. All guns loaded, swords brandished, I tried to steal a bit of time reading several emails and browse. Browsing, and I got struck by thunderbolt.  Call it hollow stomach, subconscious mind, jealousy, lack of sleep, undetected tumor, or what have you. All I know, I felt that my head was trying its might to kill me, paralyze my body, holding me from finishing whatever I got in hand.  Two tablets of pain killer to the rescue..! They made it to fulfill their jobs swiftly. Headache, what headache? Smiles come up, new spirit is high and I am ready again for yet another battle: boooooredooom....

      Is it that easy to communicate? Say, you got the latest-state-of-the-art gadget i.e. cellular phone, iPod, PDA, internet messenger, even telepathy, or whatever say you. Will that be easy to communicate?   No, of course not. RIGHT, in order to do a communication process, not only YOU got the device, your counterpart also is required to have one (may that be same model, same system, or same protocol).   Granted, you both got ones. Now communication is underway. Hmmm... I still got something in mind that is nagging and I am sure that thing will hinder the process of communication to go on. One CAN make a connection. He/she can do it instantly once he/she has got the device that is required, rite?   WRONG! A got cellphone, B got the same, even with the same model. When A tries to contact B with his cellphone it now depends on B to decide a faith of the intended communication to happen, will B pick it up? will B ignore it? or will B be available at the time A is calling?  Gadget, ability, intention, timing. I am deprived of one of those, at least once in several attempts.
