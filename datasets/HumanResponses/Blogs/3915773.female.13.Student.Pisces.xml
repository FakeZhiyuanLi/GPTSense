       According to the NYT today, it seems that large cable companies have been taking a fall and the&nbsp;smaller companies, like the regional Bells, are taking advantage of this. While Comcast has been trying to make back the profits it lost with the failed Disney merger, the Bells have teemed up with satellite providers to offer television services along with their telephone and broadband lines. Companies like Verizon and SBC, that own mobile carries, can offer wireless services and bundle plans. Comcast says its planning to introduce Internet phone services to compete with the Bells, but that isn't to be implemented until next year.  Comcast may have gained 1.1 million new digital customers in the last quarter, but they have also succeded in loosing 10.4% of its phone service suscribers and 96,000+ basic cable suscribers.

       On Tuesday, July 27, 2004, The New York Times ran an article entitled “Hussein’s Day, Not Forgetting Cookie Snacks.” The report outlines Saddam’s current living conditions, making them seem pleasant. Apparently he has been spending his time gardening, reading, and writing poems, one of which is about George Bush. The article also mentions that he has developed a love for American cookies and muffins, and even that he consumes 1,300 calories during his breakfast meal. This appears to be a public interest article rather than one published to inform. I found this very interesting considering how many serious articles the newspapers have written concerning Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Despite the fact that the newspapers have portrayed him in the past as an evil dictator, they appear to be writing about him in an almost sympathizing light, which I find to be quite unusual.

       Eight journalism students from the University of South Carolina, Emerson College and Northeastern College are blogging the Democratic convention through their cellphones (moblogging). They are providing a different perspective on the convention than viewers can get from quick soundbites on the network news.   urlLink Wireless Election Connection Moblog

       In the NYT today, there is an article about the animated online video, “This Land.” The video, appearing on Fox News, CNBC, CBS “Early Show,” and the “NBC Nightly News,” features animated Bush and Kerry characters throwing crude remarks to each other all to the tune of “This Land is Your Land.” The Spiridellis brothers, Evan and Gregg, work in the animation department at JibJab Media, who hosts the “This Land” animated film. The Gregg Spiridellis claims, “We’re hoping the buzz from this helps build our reputation and our following.” Well, the 3.7 million downloads of the film seems to show that the people want a good laugh.  &nbsp;Even though this video is about politics, I think it shows that the Spiridellis brothers seem to know good P.R. They are absolutely right in thinking by putting this video out their people will want to look more into their animated work at JibJab. This just shows that the Internet can be a very effective tool in reaching mass audiences. Now all those millions of people that downloaded the video associate it with the JibJab Media. The video has even made news on national television stations. One simple production at the right time can have success, but I feel that this could only have been done thanks to the Internet. What do you think about JibJab using this video to gain reputation? Is it ethical to make a movie about the political candidates? Would “This Land” have been a success without the Internet?&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Due to the recent down fall of video rentals, Blockbuster is expanding itself to keep up with online rental services. The main idea of the video chain store is to make it less rental orientated and more appealing to people that want to buy, sell, rent or trade video games and movies. Also, Blockbuster will be opening an online rental program that claims it will rent DVD’s for $19.95 a month compared to $21.95. However even this might not save them from the threat of video on demand. This article has a list of the top ten rented movies from Netflix and Blockbuster comparatively. The lists were quite different.  &nbsp; When Netflix was first introduced about the same time DVD’s were making an appearance of their own, my family stopped renting at Blockbuster. For our fast paced life it seemed more convenient to pick up the movie in our mailbox and return it whenever we felt like it; I think this is a major advantage of Netflix. Even though Blockbuster claims they can provide the same service for cheaper I don’t buy it. When Netflix first started it was also $19.95, but after about a year or two they claimed they had to up the cost due to shipping cost. I do believe the only thing helping the DVD by mail system is that movie studios release movies on DVD before pay-per-view. Also, the fact that in rural towns cable isn’t always available. Personally, I don’t know why the top 10 rented movies list would be so different. Do you have any ideas? Will Blockbuster be able to make a come back? Are smaller video rental companies on their way to being bought out?

       This week is the Democrats National Convention to decide on who the their candidate for the Presidency.&nbsp; It is already known that Sen. John Kerry and his running mate Sen. John Edwards will be chosen as Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates respectively.&nbsp; Thus the reason for the convention is not really choosing who will run, but confirming who will run; more importantly though it is a wonderful media blitz.&nbsp; It provides a arena where for 4 days the Democrats can present their platform and candidate to the American people and the media.&nbsp; When they do this the entire media focuses on the Democratic party, and places less emphasis on the Republican side of issues.&nbsp; This is the perfect Public Relations situation for the Democratic party.&nbsp; In fact, as the Gallup Poll organization notes    Historical precedent suggests Kerry is likely to come out of his convention with a positive "bounce" of perhaps as much as five to seven percentage points in the projected vote."     This shows that Public relations blitz of this type are a perfect way to increase a candidates possibility with likely voters.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Enquirer format conception dates back to around 1957.&nbsp; The book ( The Untold   Story )&nbsp;cites a eureka moment for Mr. Calder's hero and inspiration, Generoso Pope Jr.&nbsp; 'Gene was caught in a traffic jam and observed motorists rubbernecking to see the mangled bodies of crash victims,' Mr. Calder explains.&nbsp; 'If that's what they want, he thought, that's what I'll give them.' So he did. And he threw in physics, U.F.O.'s and strange diseases for good measure."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paragraph above describes how the National&nbsp;Enquirer, one of the world's most recognized tabloids came into existence.&nbsp; Iain Calder, who worked for the Enquirer for 20 years recently had his book  The Untold Story My 20 Years Running the National Enquirer , published.&nbsp; It describes how the Enquirer gave gripping photographs, one of their best photos was of Elvis in his casket.  "(Capturing a photo of Elvis Presley in his coffin was, by Mr. Calder's lights, one of the publication's greatest achievements.&nbsp; The fake priest with the camera in his Bible couldn't get the shot, but the Enquirer, with its famous largess, paid one of Elvis's cousins to help.)"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Enquirer also paid a Ross Cutlery $17, 500 dollars to say that he sold a knife to O.J. Simpson that looked like the knife he used in his famous murder.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is just a look at how tabloids, in this case the National Enquirer, got its information to publish that made them so successful.

       The town of Boston, hosting the democratic convention, is being over ran with political papers. All national-based papers are there along with four of Washington’s local papers, which have relocated to Boston to publish just convention news. Even though none of these smaller newspapers have a circulation of more than 21,000, the companies are charging advertisers about $10,000 dollars for a full-page ad. The point of these political papers is to be the first to report the most wanted gossip about the candidates. Hardly any paper compares with the National Journal, who has 90 reporters at the convention and sends out email bulletins to people that subscribe. Even though covering the two conventions will not be cheap, the newspapers expect to make profit from the advertisers.   &nbsp;Really, these newspapers are going to be reporting on the convention and the status of the candidates. I would think with so many newspapers competing that none of them would profit much because mostly they will all have the same information. However, these newspapers are aiming their stories directly at the people at these conventions. Most of which are from out of town and are only interested in the political race. It seems newspapers will shift their entire focus for one major event to get to these particular readers. Not to mention they make a quick profit from advertisers, who are zoomed in on this particular target audience. I don’t know if this very ethical. The papers seem to increase advertising prices and shun other news stories all because of the convention. What do you think?

       As you probably know already, Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France.&nbsp; It would be hard not to know since the front page, the sports front page, and page D7 of the New York Times are all dedicated to articles on his recent win.&nbsp; The most interesting of the reports is the one about how the “French Blow the Coverage of Armstrong’s Big Finish.”&nbsp; With this being Lance’s 6th year in a row win of the Tour, you would think that the French media system would have planned for the coverage of his win.&nbsp; In the article they said that it was predicted from last year’s Tour that Lance would be the winner this year.&nbsp; So why are there only 10 seconds of the record book win?&nbsp; The excerpt from the New York Times reads,  “John Carter, OLN’s vice president of production, said not to blame his network, which was concluding its fourth year of Tour coverage. He said that OLN wanted to lay a cable along the Champs-Elysees to allow for live cameras to follow Armstrong to the finish line.&nbsp; The request was rejected by the French production outfit, Societe Francaise de Production, or S.F.P., which controlled the video feed transmitted by satellite around the world to networks like OLN. ‘The shut down everything on the Champs-Elysees for security and other reasons,’ Carter said by telephone yesterday from Paris.&nbsp; Throughout the Tour, OLN had augmented the French production with its own cameras. ‘We would have done anything we could have to get it done,’ he said.&nbsp; But when it mattered most, Carter said, OLN could not get what it needed.”  The whole entire tour and memories of Lance’s record book win are recorded, but the cross of the finish line, &nbsp;the most important part, is 10 seconds long.

         Television commercials have become so fashionable in Britain that a new satellite network, the Advert Channel, has begun showing them 24 hours a day. 'People love commercials,' said Vince Stanzoine, managing director at the network outside of London. Marketing for the Advert Channel takes the same stance, with slogans like, ' Everything you'd see on a normal TV channel- except the programs.    Programming consisting entirely of commercials seems completely ludicrous and even funny here in the United States. After all, isn’t that what boring hours of infomercials, advertising things like cooking pans, are for? That obviously isn’t the case in Britain, probably due to the major differences between commercials in the US and Europe. Britons seem to enjoy the content between programming, which is usually creative and entertaining (Take for example, the Ikea lamp commercial we watched in class).&nbsp; In contrast to the Britain opinions on advertising, a study by Yankelovich Partners discovered that 65% of consumers feel bombarded by the amount of advertising. In addition, 69% would support the purchase of devices to omit or obstruct ads. However, nine specials on ABC, called “The Best Commercials You’ve Never Seen (And Some You Have)”, were popular with their incorporation of foreign commercials and comedy. Should a channel be devoted to commercials here in the United States? Would Americans embrace lineup upon lineup of nonstop commercials? Or should there just be a television show with an arrangement of some of the most entertaining commercials?

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While studying the article on French wine (from Friday’s NYT) that Rachel posted about, I noticed a tiny article at the bottom, about one tenth of the size of the wine article. It was about a train wreck in Turkey, in which at least 36 people died. What would make the French wine article so much more important the Turkish train wreck? Is it because people don’t care about Turkey as much as France, or because people care more about wine than human lives? Turkey and France are both far away from the USA, so distance probably didn’t have anything to do with it. Maybe there just wasn’t enough material for a large article on the wreck, or they just needed some sort of filler. In any case, it is an interesting problem to think about. What’s your opinion?

AJR has several interesting stories in the latest issue, including an interesting article on NPR,  urlLink "Quicker and Deeper"  and another on  urlLink  "The expanding blogosphere" .  Both of these would be good sources for many of your research projects.

       Sparked by a child pornography case that was ruled undecided because of confusion whether the pictures were authentic or forged has led researchers to create&nbsp;techniques that will make it harder&nbsp;to tamper with photographs.&nbsp;    At stake is more than the fate of possible child pornographers. The United States military has become increasingly reliant to digital images from drones and satellites to give soldiers a sense of the battlefield. Law enforcement officers routinely use digital cameras to photograph crime scenes. Newspapers and magazines are now dependent on digital photographs that can easily doctored.  &nbsp;   Professor Farid, an associate professor of computer science at Dartmouth College, has developed algorithms that can detect whether a photograph has been altered. For example, when two images are spliced together, one of the photographs must be altered to fit the other with image-editing software like Adobe Photoshop. This technique, no matter how cunningly put together, can be detected by the differences between the pixels within the photo. However, this test is only foolproof with uncompressed TIFF image files, which produce high quality pictures. Compressed picture formatting, which is used mostly online, makes identifying frauds more difficult.   An even more innovative technique in progress is the production of a camera that is able to take a picture of the photographer’s iris as well as one through the lens at the same moment. A person’s iris is comparable to a fingerprint. The idea is to compress all the information to be encrypted within the photograph. If any encoded data were missing, the picture would immediately be branded as a fake. Even though this method seems very high-tech, I still think it would be a long time before doctored photos are thoroughly eliminated. Technology advances every day, benefiting researchers as well as the ones doing the tampering.

       Last Friday, the New York Times published an article entitled “A Campaign to Drink Another Glass of Wine for France.” The consumption of wine in France has declined an alarmingly large amount, which is terrible news for their economy. Currently, wine is legally defined as an alcoholic beverage in France, so the industry’s advertising is limited. The wine lobbyists in the country are arguing that the substance should be redefined as a food because it is “a substance with nutritive components absorbed by the digestive tube.” This will allow the industry to advertise on television and radio, and they will no longer be required to post warnings on their product about the dangers of alcohol consumption. While this proposition would greatly help France’s economy, it contradicts the country’s desire to lower excessive drinking and driving. It will be interesting to see what France’s final decision will be.

       In class, we had been discussing missing persons and which type of missing person gets publicized the most.&nbsp; The conclusion was that young, attractive, or pregnant women get circulated the most throughout the media.&nbsp; Yahoo.com news has a headline under their “In the News” section that says, “Missing Utah Woman’s Family Clings to Hope.”&nbsp; Lori Hackings, the missing woman, is a 27 year old and also pregnant.&nbsp;   What I am wondering is how they sift through all the missing persons claims and settle on just one story to publicize across the nation.&nbsp;

       Some newspapers in the United States and elsewhere employ ombudsmen, or public editors, to review the quality of the paper and to respond to reader complaints. The official definition of an ombudsman is found on this page from the  urlLink Organization of News Ombudsmen :   "What is a news ombudsman? A news ombudsman receives and investigates complaints from newspaper readers or listeners or viewers of radio and television stations about accuracy, fairness, balance and good taste in news coverage. He or she recommends appropriate remedies or responses to correct or clarify news reports.         Why should a newspaper or broadcaster have an ombudsman? To improve the quality of news reporting by monitoring accuracy, fairness and balance.          To help his or her news provider to become more accessible and accountable to readers or audience members and, thus, to become more credible.          To increase the awareness of its news professionals about the public's concerns.          To save time for publishers and senior editors, or broadcasters and news directors, by channeling complaints and other inquiries to one responsible individual.          To resolve some complaints that might otherwise be sent to attorneys and become costly lawsuits.   The New York Times hired an ombudsman (they call him a public editor) after the Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal last summer. Daniel Okrent writes a regular column in the Sunday paper on a subject of his choosing that is not reviewed by other editors, so he can be completely independent. This week he addressed the question of whether the  urlLink New York Times is a liberal paper . His answer....on social issues, YES. He gives plenty of examples.  The column made me think of our conversation on Friday about news credibility and bias. How does this type of bias compare with the bias that many accuse Fox news of having? The answer is NOT to throw your hands up and just declare that all media are biased. What it means is that you must take responsibility to carefully chose the media you will use to form your opinions, understand how those various sources select and present their news, and balance your choices overall. Actively seek multiple points of view, and weigh them against each other. Take the time to stay informed about the important issues facing us as a society and a country. You all have important contributions to make to our future!

       The MediaGuardian.co.uk news website did a report on how many journalists were killed in wars around the world for the year of 2003.&nbsp;   They said this about the dangers of journalism, “The number of journalists killed in 2003 leapt dramatically thanks to the war in Iraq, and many more were arrested or censored, placing the state of press freedom on "red alert", according to an international media watchdog.”  Along with the 43 global journalist deaths, 14 of those deaths occurred in Iraq.&nbsp; This death toll is the highest since 1995, when 49 journalists were killed, 22 of those deaths being in Algeria.  Some of the most dangerous places for journalists are Columbia and Asia.&nbsp; The Middle East has been dubbed as the worst area for journalists.&nbsp; The Gulf War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts are responsible for 16 deaths.&nbsp; Conditions in Africa have worsened because of wars and civil conflicts.&nbsp; It was reported that Latin America was pretty stable in the area of press freedom.&nbsp; In Cuba though, the leading figures of the independent press have been put in prison.&nbsp; There is good news for journalists because the European Union has “satisfactory” conditions.  This information is interesting because a journalist would have to be very brave to want to cover the wars globally.&nbsp; Someone like Carol, from the NPR radio station that we visited, would have to have dedication and ambition to cover and investigate these topics.&nbsp; These journalists risk their lives to inform the people of the world.&nbsp;

       Warner Brothers Pictures&nbsp;has been&nbsp;having a difficult time recently as their 11 year long endeavor to recreate the successful "Superman" movie is still ongoing.   So far,  It has spent nearly $10 million in development, employed no fewer than ten writers, hired four directors and met with scores of Clark Kent hopefuls without settling on one.   The development of the movie has been littered with catastrophes; cancellations over budgets, disputes over scripts, rotating directors, and of course, the lack of a Superman. The recently replaced director for the film, Joseph McGinty Nichol, was in disagreement with Warner Brother over the location of filming. McG preferred America for reasons of authenticity and personal discomfort flying, whereas Warner Brothers chose to shoot in Australia to save $15 to $30 million. In the end, McG canceled his flight to Australia. Currently, with a new director, Warner Brothers is still working on creative and script issues for “Superman.”   With so many movies based on comic book sequels or remakes, Warner Brothers is under pressure to come up with something that will amaze audiences who have already soaked up movies such as “The Hulk” and “Daredevil.” Ahead of them are Sony Pictures Entertainment and 20th Century Fox, who have respectively profited from movies such as “Spider-Man” and “X-Men.” “Spider-Man” alone brought in over $800 million in ticket sales- not to mention income from merchandising. How will a remade “Superman” hold up? So far, there have already been 10 comic book based movies, with others such as “The Green Hornet” and “ Fantastic Four” on the way. When will audiences finally tire of this worn-out genre? Will “Superman” ever be made to win audiences before the hype is over?

       Lately the economy has become more global.&nbsp; As a result of this many brand name&nbsp;American companies that used to hold virtual monopolies over products have begun to falter.&nbsp; One such example is AT&T, which the New York Times ran an article on titled "Yet Again, a Brand Name Loses Its Magic".&nbsp; The piece details how AT&T and other brand names such as Polaroid, TWA, PanAm, and other major brand name companies have falter recently once they got to the top.&nbsp; The  Times  says that the companies fail because they often become complacent once they reach the top.&nbsp; One small, but interesting point that the  Times  makes is about the advertising of brand name companies.&nbsp; They note that:    AT&T may have cut back on marketing just when it needed to bolster its image the most. Last year, with its share of the market a fraction of what it had been even after the breakup, AT&amp;T spent an estimated $312.6 million to advertise in United States major media, compared with $427.8 million in 1998, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR, part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.   AT&T decided that it was not important to market their brand, that they were already a household name, and that it was a good way to cut costs.&nbsp; This approach seems to be the incorrect one.&nbsp; For example, the author of the article notes that Apple has become successful in recent years by marketing itself as "cool", especially with its iPod.&nbsp; With this new marketing strategy Apple has been able to make huge amounts of money.&nbsp; This shows that a large company, no matter how important still should advertise.&nbsp; But, can a large conglomerate company that has almost all the market remain "cool" in the eyes of buyers for long?&nbsp; That is one of the most important questions for large companies today.

       The  urlLink Program on International Policy Attitudes  did a study last year that compared misperceptions Americans had about the Iraq War with what news sources they used to get information. The study examined three key questions: was there a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq, were weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, and did the majority of people in other countries support our decision to invade Iraq. The study provided evidence for the answers to each of these three questions (no link/no weapons/little support). They found that 80% of people who watched Fox had one or more misperception, while 23% of PBS/NPR listeners held one or more misperception. For the other media studied, 71% of CBS viewers had one or more misperception, 61% of ABC, 55% of NBC and CNN, and 47% of people who rely on print media had one or more misperception.  Studies like this are useful in examining what media sources are the most accurate, as well as providing insights into how our political beliefs influence what we see and hear.   Fox News is getting a lot of attention right now because of a new "documentary" just released called "Outfoxed"( urlLink watch the trailer ) that claims that Fox news is unfair, unbalanced and biased. You can read reviews of the new DVD in a number of places, including  urlLink Wired magazine  and  urlLink USA Today.

       Digital Radio Signals are in the making according to Clear Channel Radios, who plan to convert 100 of their stations to digital radio. Apparently, the digital signals make the FM stations have the quality of a CD. One set back to this great idea is that people do not have digital radio receivers, and Kenwood, a company that recently began making the receivers, priced such a devise at about $500. Also, the Federal Communications Commission has been asked by the Recording Industry Association of America to prohibit the use of digital radio because of the possible widespread piracy.  &nbsp;Since we just visited the radio broadcasting station, I thought this article was relevant to what we have been covering. In our textbook, there is the mention of digital radio and names the lack of receivers for digital signals as the reason why digital radio hasn’t taken off. I am not sure of the entire process to making digital radio system works, but if the quality of the sound is improved than I think it should at least be tried. I am sure that if the public ends up not liking the digital radio, radio stations will hear about it. The only loss is to the radio companies. By acquiring digital radio signals, large radio companies like Clear Channel could move to using these. Meanwhile the traditional FM signals could be given to the small, local radio broadcasting stations. If I were the F.C.C., I would definitely be looking at these possibilities. What do you think about adopting digital radio? Or, should we stick with what has worked for decades?

       NASA has always mainly been an isolated organization that works inside the US, without the cooperation of other countries' space programs; but, as the New York Times article titled NASA Finally Gets Down To Business Side of Space&nbsp;shows, NASA is finally expanding and working with other space agencies.&nbsp; Because NASA has been isolated for so long it has decided to take an active role in promoting itself.&nbsp; It attended the Farnborough International Air Show to increase support for NASA.&nbsp; To do this they set up an exhibit that cost around $600,000.&nbsp; It included a space suit that people could try on.&nbsp; This PR move seems to have been to some degree effective, after all NASA got the New York Times to run an article on it, but I'm not sure how this will help NASA develop relationships with other Space agencies in the future.&nbsp;

       Ben Cohen, you would know him as the founder of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, has “taken to the road with a 12-foot effigy of President Bush.”&nbsp; It has fake flames coming out of the president’s pants.&nbsp; He made it this way so as to point out all of the president’s lies (liar, liar pants on fire).&nbsp; “In a polite society, you don’t go up to a person and look at them in the face and say, ‘You’re a liar.’”&nbsp; Cohen was quoted in a phone interview in Spokane, Washington, which is his next stop on his Pants on Fire Tour.&nbsp; The PantsOnFire-Mobile is a trailer that is pulled behind Cohen’s car.&nbsp; The electronic ticker on the front of the effigy displays some of what Cohen calls, “Bush’s lies.”&nbsp; The head rotates and has pictures of various George Bush facial expressions.&nbsp; He plans to take it across the country as a way of advertising against Bush for the upcoming election.&nbsp; This is the most interesting presidential advertisement I have heard of so far.&nbsp; It’s a joke to make people aware of the negatives of George W. Bush.&nbsp; What would you think if you saw this being pulled behind a car on the highway?

       During the summer season, most television shows begin to show repeats of hit shows that aired previously that fall. This summer FOX pushed for attention to the fact that they would be hosting a brand new summer line up. However studies show that the number of people watching the reruns of T.V. crime dramas is far exceeding that of the new shows. Meaning “C.S.I.,” “C.S.I. Miami,” and “Cold Case,” all of which are on CBS are taking the top spot of television shows. Next is NBC, which also hosts some crime dramas along with reality shows. ABC’s comedies usually take over during the summer season, but even those have tapered off. Meanwhile FOX, is struggling in the number four position. Two of their summer shows, “The Jury” and “The Casino” have already been canceled; this is not a good sign for their other shows that are barely surviving the season.  &nbsp;The reason that the reruns are at the top is because they are great shows. Also I believe audiences like the opportunity to solve a mystery for a second time or a first if they missed an episode during the regular season. Besides, many people during the summer travel. So there isn’t going to be that many people sitting at home every night watching T.V. as is during the fall season. However I find it peculiar that this article didn’t mention the FOX program “The North Shore.” According to many people I have talked to, it is the best new show of the summer. I would have figured that if “The North Shore” had been a flop too that this article would have mentioned it. So this leads me to believe that FOX does have a hit show, but the paper neglected to mention that because this article is based on the idea of showing that reruns outperform new shows. Even though I do feel FOX wasn’t given as much credit as they could have been, I think that next summer FOX will rethink the idea of announcing new shows to begin in the month of June.

       Do you think magazines should filter their advertisements, to make sure they are suitable for the targeted audience? Or should magazines accept money from anyone who wants to advertise a legal product?  That question was highlighted in The New York Times today, by a group who is upset that National Geographic Kids has ads for sugary junk food (especially since the cover story of the grown-up version of National Geographic this month is on obesity).   "The Center for Science in the Public Interest has sent a letter to the National Geographic Society, publisher of the magazines, complaining about the ads for products like Hostess cupcakes and Kellogg's Smorz cereal in the publications.   "It is unconscionable that the National Geographic Society, with its esteemed reputation and longstanding educational mission for both adults and children, has chosen to cram National Geographic Kids magazine with advertisements for sugary cereals, candy and snack foods," the letter says."   From  urlLink  "Obesity and National Geographic"   by Nat Ives, July 21, 2004.

       On Monday, Clear Channel Radio proclaimed that their 1,200 stations would limit the amount of commercials aired. Some of the stipulations are no more than 12 minutes of commercials per hour, four minutes and less during every commercial break, and no more than six ads during any single commercial break. There are just too many ads. In the first five months of this year ad spending has risen 4%. Also, the average listener hears 3 hours less of radio a week compared&nbsp;to&nbsp;10 years ago. As chief executive concluded,  "If you have listened to the radio at all, you know that there is an amazing amount of commercial and promotional inventory. So much so that we have run the risk of diluting our product." Clear Channel is hoping to bring back listeners who tune out during commercial breaks. Also, pressure from Clear Channel having fewer commercials may cause other radio stations to limit advertisements too.  &nbsp;  Finally, the radio industry has caught on to the demand of the public. I have to say that I am one of the compulsive station switchers as soon as a commercial is being aired. When I am listening to the radio, I want to hear music. If I wanted to hear advertisements, I would turn on the T.V. and watch infomercials. My experiences say that for every half hour of radio, 20 minutes is music and 10 minutes are dedicated to commercials, which is about 20 minutes an hour. I am all for the limiting of commercials. I think this is a great company move by Clear Channel considering other outlets of music are growing more popular everyday such as satellite radio, I-Pods, and MP3 players. Most of my friends don’t even listen to the radio because they prefer CDs. However, the limitations of commercials I doubt will keep people, especially channel surfers, on the same station during commercials. Listeners will have a sense of ease knowing that there will be about 8 minutes less of advertising which means more music.&nbsp; Radio companies aren’t interested if people stay tuned in during commercials now that the commercial breaks are shorter. The real point of this campaign is to get people to tune back into their radio station quicker.&nbsp;

       In the article headlined "Iraq Gives Order to Reopen Paper G.I.'s Had Closed," the importance of freedom of the press is shown.&nbsp; In the article, it describes the ordre by the new Iraqi government to reopen a paper closed by American order.&nbsp; "The closing was a catalyst for some of the worst anti-American mayhem of the occupation," the article says.&nbsp; This issue of freedom of the press obviously matters to Dr. Allawi, who ordered the reopening, and to the Iraqis who launched "anti-American mayhem" after the paper was closed.&nbsp; The anger shown toward Americans when they closed a paper down amazes me since the Iraqis have lived for so long without freedom of the press.&nbsp; The reopening of the paper is a sign of the U.S. letting the Iraqi interim government make decisions, even if they are contrary to previous American decisions.&nbsp; It just shows how much the power has shifted.

       In Friday’s New York Times, on page A20, I read an amusing article about a nudist camp for young people. There was recently a bit of legal difficulty, though, in ensuring that the camp would take place. However, the camp, which takes place next week, was allowed to proceed, although the camp coordinators put into place a rule, saying that the campers (aged 11-17) must bring at least one parent or guardian with them.  &nbsp;   True, the judge, Richard L. Williams., allowed the full array of naked camp activities to process, including, according to court papers, swimming, volleyball, tennis, table tennis, body painting, pudding fights, “shaving cream follies” and, alarmingly, darts.  &nbsp;  I was surprised that they chose to put something like this in the newspaper. The article was very entertaining, but I wasn’t quite sure what purpose it served. Perhaps it was just in there for a little bit of human interest. It wasn’t  completely  pointless; I enjoyed reading it.   However, it makes me wonder. The article didn’t seem very relevant to anything, besides the fact that the camp “is an hour’s drive southeast from here”, presumably meaning New York. Why would a journalist put something like that in a newspaper for reasons other than human interest (or, for nudists, information on possible summer camps)? Unless the journalist (Adam Liptak) was a nudist himself, I don’t see any major reason why to publish the article. Perhaps Liptak thought it would give insight to some of the activities and lives of a very small minority in America. Does anyone have any other thoughts?

       In July 16’s New York Times, I read a review of The Cinderella Story, by Stephen Holden. I have not seen the movie, but the review provided a basic overview. The movie is basically the old fairy tale, Cinderella, modernized. As says the review,  &nbsp;   Even for a fairy tale, “A Cinderella Story”, directed by Mark Rosman from a screenplay by Leigh Dunlap, fails to make sense. In an environment where looks are everything, no one notices that Samantha is far and away the prettiest girl in high school. Only a blind person could fail to guess the Girl in White’s identity when she makes her entrance wearing a tiny white mask. And a dropped cell phone as a substitute for a glass slipper simply will not do.  &nbsp;  I haven’t seen this movie, but I have seen ads for it, and I got the same impression. Is Hollywood so uncreative that it can’t even come up with a new idea for a movie, and is forced to hash and rehash old fairy tales? And on top of that, mess it up? The media is largely based on money, and while some people do get jobs by pure talent, most get jobs by money, or knowing the right people (who, coincidentally, have money). So not necessarily all movies have large amounts of talent, creativity and/or thought to back them up.  &nbsp;  While I probably don’t have the right to criticize a movie that I haven’t seen, I do find it interesting that there have been so many different retellings of Cinderella over the years. Yet I don’t know of any greatly publicized modern retellings besides this movie. Perhaps old fairy tales were meant to stay old. Maybe the media has used up all the material left in this well-known story, and should try to some new idea. If the media tries out one thing, and it turns out to be a great hit, they’ll keep doing it over and over until everything’s dry, boring and uninteresting. And even then they will continue with the idea until it makes no money at all anymore.  &nbsp;  The long and short of it is that the media doesn’t really care what the general response to its products is, just as long as the products bring in money. The Cinderella Story will probably make some money, and the media will continue to create new Cinderella stories until no one watches, reads or listens to them, since in our modern, money-based world, income comes first. Quality is second.

       "Cover Girl is reinforcing its 'look good, be good" message with music fresh off the CD burner. The cosmetics company has teamed with Atlantic Records to create its own record label, CG Vibes: Music That Gives Back".  &nbsp;  Cover Girl, whose previous message was "we are a strong believer in inner and outer beauty", has freshened itself up with it's new "look good, be good" statement. CG Vibes' first CD is a collection of nine songs from prevalent artists such as Queen Latifah, Brandy, and the Corrs. Cover Girl plans to market and sell the CDs from July 20th&nbsp;to the end of December. They plan to use the proceeds&nbsp;"to finance $10,000 grants to five young women in recognition of their community service". One shall go to a young woman who has applied herself in music, two to those "who start programs to fulfill unmet needs", and the other two to "young women who have had an effect on an existing program". &nbsp; Managing partner at the Prophet Judy Hopelain remarks, "They're probably hoping that the 'cool factor' can rub off on them from the music, and that the passion that young people feel about their causes will rub off on the Cover Girl brand". Of course, the artists featured in the CD will recieve money for their work, but also media publicity.&nbsp;Does the consumer benifit at all from this new advertising angle? Or is it a nice cover&nbsp;to increase sales of both the CD and&nbsp;Cover&nbsp;Girl's products?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday, July 12th, the New York Times ran an article about two accidents entitled “4 Die in 2 Small Plane Crashes In New York and New Jersey.” In class we have been discussing how there is a reason for printing every report, so I am having a difficult time understanding how this article found its way into the New York Times. Both plane crashes are completely unrelated. The first occurred at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday in New York; the second happened at 12:15 p.m. on Sunday afternoon in New Jersey.&nbsp; There were two people in both planes, all four of which died. No one else was hurt. While these events are tragic, I do not see how they appeared in a national newspaper, or why for that matter, the journalist chose to connect them. Also, at the bottom of the page, directly beneath the report on the plane crashes, there is a line that says, “Give to the fresh air fund.” Is this some form of a miniature advertisement or a subliminal message? Perhaps it’s just something that the New York Times is indorsing. Does anyone have any ideas?

       Recently the Nielsen rating company has come under attack for its change in rating systems.&nbsp; They decided to switch to a new type of electron monitoring box.&nbsp; Since they have switched to this new box the "[i]n one time slot, black viewership showed a 32 percent decline".&nbsp; Such a huge decline could not go unnoticed, and in fact it has not.&nbsp; Critics of the Nielsen rating systems are crying that this is further hiding the viewing habits of minority groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This conflict over the accuracy of the new Nielsen boxes highlights how important viewership is to the television media.&nbsp; So many decisions are based upon viewership that if these statistics are inaccurate the television media may be hurt and lose money.&nbsp; Often people feel controlled by the media, but this reveals how controlled the media is by them.&nbsp; The audience/consumer is the final judge on the merit of a show, and with it how much advertising revenue the station is going to receive.&nbsp; Although people are often at the mercy of the mass media, they do have some control over the course of action the media takes.  &nbsp;

       You've been discussing the power of books to stimulate intellect and imagination, and the Harry Potter series is certainly an example of the power books still have in our culture. But what messages are readers of Harry Potter taking away with them? A group of French literary theorists have been debating this question, most recently on the pages of the French newspaper, Le Monde. One of the essays was reprinted in The New York Times today, worth registering for and reading, for those of you interested in the capitalistic messages of today's influential mass media. From  urlLink  "Harry Potter, Market Wiz:"    "Harry Potter, probably unintentionally, thus appears as a summary of the social and educational aims of neoliberal capitalism. Like Orwellian totalitarianism, this capitalism tries to fashion not only the real world, but also the imagination of consumer-citizens. The underlying message to young fans is this: You can imagine as many fictional worlds, parallel universes or educational systems as you want, they will still all be regulated by the laws of the  market. Given the success of the Harry Potter series, several generations of young people will be indelibly marked by this lesson. "

       On Friday the 16th the New York Times ran an article entitle  Former Leader Is Still a Power In China's Life .&nbsp; The way that the New York Times decided that the "former leader" Jiang Jemin was still in power was through the Chinese media.&nbsp; They noted:     "BEIJING, July 14 -- With bold front-page headlines and top billing on the main television news show, China's state media announced this week that Jiang Zemin, the country's military chiet, had visted the northern city of Sheyang and called on troops there 'to master revolutionary theory"  According to the times this is "standard fare for the Communist&nbsp;Party-controlled media".&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it&nbsp;does not seem any different from&nbsp;a normal event and normally would not show that this man is still in power.&nbsp; But the event that the media&nbsp;in China reported on occured 13 years ago.&nbsp; This means that Jiang is a significant enough figure to be&nbsp;reported on 13 years after an event happens.  &nbsp;  The media report on Jiang shows he&nbsp;is a powerful figure.&nbsp; With this it shows&nbsp;how powerful the media is.&nbsp; The New&nbsp;York&nbsp;Times only realized how powerful Jiang might be after the media ran a story on him.&nbsp; The people at the Times know that media coverage on events&nbsp;such that&nbsp;reported in&nbsp;China&nbsp;is a significant indicator of power.  &nbsp;

       &nbsp;&nbsp; When reading the New York Times article "A Cellphone Boycott Fails to Produce Sounds of Silence," I was surprised to discover just how attached the people of Lebanon have become to their cellphones. On Thursday, July fifteenth,&nbsp;the consumers' union requested everyone in the country to refrain from using their cellphones to protest the absurd high rates. The protest was an excellent idea, with the exception of one small factor; the country's citizens are addicted to their cellphones. According to the article,&nbsp;the people of Lebanon&nbsp;have no problem answering their cell phones during movies, or even during funerals for that matter. Perhaps one of the most interesting attempts&nbsp;at boycott in the country was that of Abou Abed and Abou Staif, who decided to use carrier pigeons for the day. When one of the messages was did not get delivered, they ended up using their cellphones to figure out what had happened. The success of the boycott is still being debated, for&nbsp;the consumer associated&nbsp;found that 30% of the cellphones in the country were shut off, but the ministry spokesman bleives the number to only be 10%. Either way, I was shocked to discover just how quickly society can become dependent on a such a recently released form of communication.

       Medco, a pharmacy benefit manager, began its first advertising campaign earlier this week. Medco who already serves about 60 million people didn't begin advertising to gain clients, or inform people that despite federal scrutiny their services are above all else. Their first ad which appeared in the The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal is simple and informative about the company. As Mr. Smith of Gothem, the company's head of&nbsp;marketing,&nbsp;stated,"These are introductory ads."&nbsp;   Despite this company's ridicule by federal organizations, I have to say that they are using the media in a very effective way. Instead of being hounded with prescription ads that say they have the best prices anywhere, this ad seems not pressuring.&nbsp;I think the company has the right idea about making ads more informative. As I looked at the ad it seemed more like a brochure about the company than an ad to get&nbsp;you to&nbsp;use them as your pharmacy benefit manager. The company seems to want to establish a connection with the public about their company which many aren't familiar with. Honestly I would hope that more companies take this approach rather than making an ad that seems like all the company is after is your money. By sending this new message through and ad I feel the company will get a lot of praise. Also it&nbsp;can expect an increase of clients. It just goes to show that the conventional way of reaching people won't always&nbsp;work.

       We've been talking in class about the value of deliberation for democracy, and ways that journalism either supports or thwarts thoughtful deliberation.  I thought this article, on the efforts of officials to keep demonstrators away from the political conventions in Boston and New York this summer, made some good points along this line:   Many ordinary citizens seek similar insulation in their own lives. They want to be protected from contradictory views or voices. Radio and cable audiences prefer outlets and pundits that confirm rather than challenge their own views. Media moguls pander to this anti-democratic drift by offering up partisanship and polemic in larger and larger doses.   As a result, we are increasingly polarized in our ideologies. Ads that attack rather than inform are the weapon of choice for political campaigns. We regard those with differing views not as fellow participants in a democratic adventure but as enemies to quash. Rather than listen and respond, we prefer to silence by intimidation and isolation or to crush with raw political power.  Our national conventions once were robust and riveting affairs, with gavel-to-gavel coverage on network television. Now, scripted and predictable, they have come to symbolize a tendency among too many Americans toward shutting up and shutting out viewpoints other than our own.  If that tendency endures, our democracy cannot. We should not fear dissenting views but embrace them as opportunities to improve our own positions and to display our confidence in the give-and-take of democratic discourse.  Without disagreement, even discord, political discourse is mere noise and prattle. A people talking only to themselves and shouting at all others gurgles with an awful sound: the death rattle of democracy.   Here are some potentially interesting political links:  Political sites:  urlLink George Bush Web site   urlLink John Kerry Web site   urlLink Ralph Nader Web site   urlLink Republican National Committee   urlLink Democratic National Committee   Non-partisan sites  urlLink Factcheck.org   urlLink Spin Sanity   urlLink Vote Smart   urlLink Opensecrets.org   urlLink Center for Public Integrity

       The Fox network is in current production of a reality show called, "The Next Great Champ." Not only is Fox being intervened because of the possible boxing matches that took place without a licensed promoter, NBC also claims that Fox stole the idea in the first place from them. As of now the chairman of commission, Sanford L. Michealman, has scheduled another hearing on July 21 and subpoenaed all the companies involved with the Fox production including Endemol, Lock and Key, and Golden Boy enterprises. Now the question is what penalty if any should Fox receive? Can the commission allow Fox to air a reality show that might have been staged considering their wasn't a licensed official for some of the matches?  &nbsp;  In my opinion I don't think Fox or NBC should be allowed to air their boxing reality shows this fall. The situation is completely unethical. Fox would make money off a show that isn't even real, which I believe it has to be for the sake of being called reality TV. Even if viewers don't watch the Fox version of the show because they know it is probably staged, then they will tune in to NBC. Now NBC is profiting from Fox's former misfortunes. Not only that, these shows could hurt the companies&nbsp;reputation.&nbsp;As a viewer of many television reality shows, I feel that both stations, if decide&nbsp;to air the shows,&nbsp;wouldn't get that many viewers anyway because of this scandalous outbreak. Many people will probably have heard about the lack of accuracy in the show and find it to be a big joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that Fox tried to cut corners to beat NBC to the punch of broadcasting the first ever boxing reality show. In doing so, they left out some key paperwork that is now causing them more trouble than what they were expecting.&nbsp;Now Fox&nbsp;will&nbsp;accomplish in&nbsp;doing the opposite of&nbsp;what they&nbsp;intended which was to&nbsp;get ahead. Other networks are all ready taking this opportune moment to go to the drawing board and come up with something that will be even better than reality boxing.

       In an article from the New York Times, Nat Ives&nbsp;writes the article " Putting out&nbsp;the message that&nbsp;registering and then voting should be part&nbsp;of youth culture."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Today, Declare Yourself, a non-partisan voter-registration group started by the television producer Norman Lear, will raise two giant billboards in Times Square, showing Christina Aguilera and Andre 3000 with their mouths held shut, next to the message, 'Only you can silence yourself.'"  &nbsp;  In this year's election, nonpartisan groups such as Cast the Vote, the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, Redeem the Vote, Voter Virgin, Voteloud, Voces del Pueblo, Punk Voter, Rock the Vote and Choose or Lose, hope to increase voter turnout. They employ broad marketing tactics targeting young voters, from "sending interactive text messages to cell phones" to "producing performances by everyone from the Rza of W-Tang Clan fame to the Rock 'N' Roll Worship Circus." A cause for such persistent encouragement to vote may be derived from the 2000 election's close outcome. Another theory is that an increasing number of young adults are finding an increasing interest in politics. Whatever the cause, the advertisements seem to be working. In a study of the Iowa assembly from the Harvard University Institute of Politics, 17% of people under the age of 30 are participant voters, up from only 9% in 2000.  &nbsp;  Hopefully, these ads do influence more young voters to vote. In a time of political tesion, every vote should count, because the victor will lead our country. As photographer David LaChapelle said, "It's going to be scary if you don't use your voice."   &nbsp;

       "The study of 1, 906 feature films between 1992 and 2003 found more violence and sex in PG movies ("parental guidance suggested") and more of those elements and profanity in PG-13 movies ("Parents strongly cautioned"). It also found more sex and profanity in R-rated movies ("Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian") than a decade ago.  "when you look at the average, today's PG-13 movies are approaching what the R movies looked like in 1992,' said Kimberly Thompson, associate professor of risk analysis and decision science at Harvard's School of Public Health, who was a co-author of the study. 'Today's PG is approaching what PG-13 looked like a decade ago."  When parents look at a movie to buy for their children and they see PG, they consider the movie to be remotely safe for their children. In actual reality, the perception of the public eye is changing and what seemed violent ten years ago is is not enough to satisfy this generations appetite for violence.  When a customer looks at the rating, they can usually see why the movie is rated what it is. The M.P.A.A. has created so many different meanings for the same word that the original message can get misinterpreted. For instance, what is the difference between violence and action violence?  When parents are concerned about what their child is watching, it would most likely be best for them to either preview the movie themselves or to have a family movie night and spend some quality time with their children.

       Whoopi Goldberg was on the diet commercials for Slim-Fast. Her slogan was, "I'm a Big Loser." This was indicating her weight loss thanks to the Slim-Fast program. At a recent fundraiser to raise money for presidential candidate John Kerry and his vice president, John Edwards, Whoopi made "a lewd riff on President Bush." These comments that she made with a wine glass in hand has gotten her cut from starring in the commercials any longer. The New York Post describes her comment as "Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia." Her comments offended guests at the prestigous event. The General Manager of the Slim Fast company says, "Ads featuring Ms. Goldberg will no longer be on the air." The Slim-Fast company is being a gatekeeper now, so as to keep out Whoopi's negative comments by cutting her as the star of the commercials. She is getting punished for her lack of thought and the embarrassment she has caused the Slim-Fast company.

       In the article in the New York Times headlined "French Condemns Anti-Semitic Act," French President Jacques Chirac is quoted as asking that effort be used "to find the authors of this shameful act."  This shameful act was an attack on a woman the attackers believed was Jewish.    This article caught my attention first because France is all for cultural assimilation, and therefore the government is not usually supportive of other cultures exisitng in France.  It is interesting that this woman was not actually Jewish, which could help government sensitivities toward her.  Also, the primary reason for the attack seems to be theft, since the attackers realized only after the attacked began that the woman could be Jewish.  The attackers showed signs of anti-Semitism, but only after the attack started.  The attackers motive was theft, and later they decided to add elements of a hate crime.  This really is not much of an Anti-Semitic attack, then, if the primary motive had nothing to do with anti-Semitism.  Yet the article headlined it in that way, and therefore was misleading.

       An article in the New York Times by Ken Belson titled "G.O.P. Hopes WebSites Will Be a Link to Small Donor" effectively highlights the increasing importance of the internet in everyday life.  The G.O.P. has seen the effectiveness of democratic online fundraising and has decided to try doing so itself; so, it will hire sites to display a link to a donation page.  The question though is why is this such a popular way for political parties to raise money?  First of all it is because it is often cheaper than other more conventional methods of fundraising.  Second it is also easier for people to donate online than to go to the trouble of going to a fundraiser.    An additional and important point though is that "people might be more likely to donate if their favorite site appears to endorse the idea of giving to political parties".  This trust represents an important development in the mass media.  Previously most people would be convinced to donate to a political campaign if a person they trusted supported that party.  Now with the rise of the internet people are putting more trust in mass media.  Now that parties have figured this out they are able to exploit it to raise more funds.  Important to consider though is if people actually have enough loyalty to their site to support a political group because of its apparent endorsement.  I think that in only a few cases to people put enough trust in the choices of their website to actually donate to an organization because of its displaying of an ad. Pax Tirrell

          "Two weeks before the democratic convention and under pressure from conservatives, President Bush is escalating his support for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, moving the issue to the forefront of the campain and underscoring what his aides said was a critical difference between the president and John Kerry." -The New York Times, 7-12-04, front page     The way I see it, a human being is still a human being, regardless of their sexual preference. The Constitution's primary purpose is to protect America's human beings and insure their rights. If it causes no harm to another, I strongly believe a human being should be allowed to embrace his or her beliefs and values. I do not see this as an issue of whether the gay population is right or wrong to believe what they do, but an issue of how far the American goverment is willing to push its citizens' rights. America stands for freedom. An amendment to the constitution will not eliminate America's gay population, it will only oppress it and eliminate the freedom which America was built on.

       VH1 aired the newly acclaimed series,"I love the 90's" on Monday night. This however is only one of their new witty shows that have taken hold of about 100,000 new fans. Along with this brand new series, VH1 hosts "Best Week Ever" and "Best Month Ever" as part of their channel reform. These shows include hysterical recalls of the previous week or month or decade by modern humorists.  Through all of these short history lessons, I wonder if Vh1 is going to far in recounting the past. Honestly, only so many stories are going to appeal to people, and if they have heard the same story about the same person or happening over and over again, certain subjects will die out. Or will we be forced to rehash subjects that have been critized over  and over again? As Ms. Harris, a panelist for VH1's shows, states "We all joke that these pop culture shows will eventually eat themselves...Soon we will be doing the 'Best Minute Ever.'" I have a tendency to agree with her about this possiblity. These shows are great now, but I consider the question,"How long can VH1 keep ahead?"

       Los Angeles Times media critic David Shaw has a column today arguing that  urlLink  "News as entertainment is sadly becoming the norm."   He asserts, based on observations by university professors who have studied media habits, that people are intellectually lazy.  He says, "They don't want to sort through conflicting reports, often presented in a relatively dry, factual fashion, to figure out what's important and who's right in any news-making scenario."  He goes on:   I think young people — those in their late teens and 20s — are particularly susceptible to these one-sided, half-baked news mcnuggets. Thanks to MTV, and instant messaging and other rapid-fire features of the Internet, most young people today want everything in quick, small bites. They get their news — to the extent that they get any — inadvertently, almost by osmosis, absorbing bits of it on various websites or between the radio play of their favorite songs or while clicking the television remote control.    Shaw quotes another professor, who argues that other trends are also contributing to the loss of a "news habit" among Americans:   "The wealthier a society is, the more self-consciously individualistic it is and the less an individual feels obligated to consider things outside oneself and one's immediate interests," says Robert Calvert, a political science professor at DePauw University. "The last thing kids want out of a college education today is to learn how to be a better citizen. All they're concerned with is career preparation."   Calvert thinks this mind-set leads to more — worse — than mere civic ignorance.   "You wind up with people working for, and maybe at the top of, major industries who have no interest in institutions or in our cultural and moral environment, and that's a real national problem," he says. "That's how you wind up with Enron."   What do you think of these arguments? Does the media technology we use today affect our power to reason, to deliberate? How would describe the news habit in your home?  How does it affect your life and perspective?

       A new report by the National Endowment of the Arts called "Reading at Risk" shows that 43.4 percent of Americans didn't read any kind of book in the previous year (up from 39% ten years earlier). They also found that fewer people are reading (and enjoying) literature. They asked people what they would rather do than read literature. Here are the answers:   "Of the adults surveyed, 95.7 percent preferred watching television, 60 percent preferred attending a movie and 55 percent preferred lifting weights or doing other exercise to reading literature. Even 47 percent chose working in the garden."  urlLink Fewer People Make Time for Literature, NEA Study Shows     What implications does this shift have for the media of the future? Are our habits of learning becoming more visual, less textual? Or is it just that "books" are evolving into new forms that the people who write surveys haven't accounted for?  An opinion piece in Saturday's (7/10/04) New York Times,  urlLink The Closing of the American Mind  takes a pessimistic view of the results of the survey. The author writes:    The Nazis were right in believing that one of the most powerful weapons in  a war of ideas is  books. And for better or worse, the United States is now in such a war.   Without books, we cannot succeed in our current struggle against absolutism and terrorism.  The retreat from civic to virtual life is a retreat from engaged democracy, from the principles that we say we  want to share with the rest of the world.   You are what you read.   If you read nothing, then your mind withers, and your ideals lose their vitality and sway.    What do you think? Are you what you read? Or are there other ways to keep your mind vital and engaged?
