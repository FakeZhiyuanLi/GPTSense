      Well ...  during the unconscious courtship, why unconscious? Because we both did not expect that it was a courtship period. We thought it would be a merely blossomed well friendship that is going at a very high speed. Somehow or rather, I had an instinct inside me, telling me that it was more than friends, more than soulmates.   It was chemistry that started to react between the both of us. I tried to deny it but yet I started to miss his presence when I return to hometown or when I was on a trip with my boyfriend. I sms him a lot. It seems that the egg means more than anyone else at that moment.   I remember the most unforgettable moment was in Genting Highlands. I went up on a Wed night (i remember that the most). Both of us headed from KL sentral to the highlands just to chill out and spend a night there without getting a room to stay in. When we reached there, we had dinner, we walked around, we watched a movie "Bruce Almighty".   Just then , I broke down mentally and cried and he was holding me and lend his shoulders for me to cry on and thank God he was there to comfort me at that critical moment. I was crying like a baby that night when it was raining and the wind was blowing super cold.   And we chilled out the whole night at the open air.. and we were freezing in cold.. rubbing our hands against each other to produce more heat..  Yeah, guess what? HE was holding me tightly in his arms because I was feeling tremendously cold. I like to play with him, and so does he. Especially when he held me in his arms, I tried to blow his ears and made him shiver. U know deep inside me, I was thinking to myself.. great...Chemistry has already started but i tried to keep it within myself only. He just wrapped me around just like that. He himself was feeling cold too, but yet he cared for me. That really melted me down. The way he cared for me at that moment was so so so precious. I really wished that time could just freezed at that moment so that I don't need to worry about anything else but to sit down at the car park of First World Hotel (open air), gazing upon the endless diamond skies... watching at the glittering stars with him. It was beautiful. Yes.. a very signficant moment

      Well, the friendship did blossom from one day to another. Together with Sia, and Edwin and the rest of the AO gang that we used to be one big family. Especially in August Check Out period where we have to check rooms all the time. And it so happened when I finished doing mine with COral and Edwin, I went on to help Egg and Cintia. Well, of course Egg and I began to be really close friends as we worked more. Somehow or rather, we just want to sit next to each other by spontaneous, we just want to be together anywhere, anyhow.   Even in the bus, or in the train, or in the cinema, we just like to sit side by side. During the room inspection period in August, yeah.. we AUDP students have a midterm break, and we worked all day, but party all night. In the sense that, we drink liquor, and we chatted the whole night. And for me, I hang out so much in his room and almost every night I will turn out to sleep in his room. Too bad, he has to sleep on the floor while I slept on his bed. Edwin will just have to pity him I guess as his roommate.   Everynight we chatted thru msn, and then met face to face, sharing problems to each other.. yelling to the air to let go of tension. Well, we both faced the same problem at the time... what problem would it be?? Hahaha.. love??? yeahh...relationship problem. I would listen to his , and he would do the same for me.   Last year August was simply the best... we sms a lot to each other, WE called each other a lot. MOre than he called his girlfriend, or me to my boyfren. We just had so much to explore in each other's life and we wanted to know each other more ...yeah...so keen and eager to experience one another.   I guess the friendship has to go to the next level...

      What can I say?? Life with this man was both memorable and unbearable. Started with a kiss back in college one night.. just because we were both the best of pals, listening to one another's heart problems and sharing out loud to one another about life, love and practically every single thing we could just pour out to each other without any fear. Before that sudden spark, we met all the way just in one department where both of us were working part time even though when we were studying. Yeah, still remember how he took my number and started to call me when we were on duty. And I remember I sent him one sms which started with the phrase "I Love You" which almost freaked him out..by the time he scrolls down the message, he knew it was meant to be a crazy lil prank that i played on him. Guess what? Until today, he's still keeping that message of mine. That was like one year ago...so Long for today... to be continued...

      Dear Bloggy,  Throughout the whole week, I wasn't happy. I had been arguing a lot with my boyfriend. Hontouni Kanashi! Wakate rute.. I know he's got lots to deal with especially in his stepping-stone career & his stepping stone of financial foundation. One thing I wasn't really happy about was he's not ambitious. He is not prestigious in his vision and he prefer to lead a life with major simplicity. Not filled with a single complexion. To be successful in working society, one has to be far-visioned and beyond his imagination, he has to work all his way through. I wonder is he really learning anything from Accommodation Office of a private institution. Yes, I know his major criteria of working here is to be with me daily. But he's not learning anything and it's not worth at a long run. Last Saturday, he actually got an offer to interview in a bank, a position of Unit Trust Consultant was offered. But he rejected it. Damn! This is the saddest part of life I guess. How could he ever reject such offer? A offer of a lifetime where one does not always get a reply from job applications! His sickening excuses are still ringing in my head. "Don't like city life. Hate traffic jams! Wanna be far away from hustle and bustle of city life." These few excuses can be repeatedly playing in my mind for the past few days. Well I mean, in order to climb the corporate ladder, I don't mind all the hustle and bustle if I get a good pay and I can earn more for a better living in future. I mean... investment is a risk but whether it is worth the cost. I think it's worthwhile after all. Yeah rite.. claiming that his interpersonal skills is better than me. But the fact is, he deal with students more than people who are aligned with corporate affairs. How could he ever improve himself or his interpersonal skills in that Accommodation Office? Ahhh... PLEASE... Only he can self praise himself at all times.   For my life partner, I know I hope that relationship will last. If my boyfriend knows how to treasure me well and appreciate every single thing I do, I seriously do not mind tying the knot with him in future. But if he always has this simple mind, living a simple life under a rented roof but not belonged... Forget it. Life is Survival.. To survive is to work to earn. I can't bear his costs like now. Food and groceries and petrol and etc.. at this moment, I might be happily, voluntarily paying for him. But in future, I know I will get tired of it and it's time for him to earn himself and, moreover, I am not earning a 4 digit salary like him now. I'm still a part time staff but at least I get to pay off my living expenses here sufficiently without any savings at all. There is no such thing of man-woman equality in being the breadwinner of the household. Man is always the one paying for the most of everything in a household. So do you think I would want to pay for his items anymore? He would take me for granted in future, and probably he would think.."Ahh..She will pay for me. She will provide for me. Saves my pocket!" AHHH.. If he dares to even think of that, I would really declare him as an 'Asshole'! ( Sorry Lord, forgive me for being rude & impolite and calling names but I'm really on my nerves at him at times.)  To be frank, i do love him a lot even though at times we argue like cats and dogs. And I have 'belonged' to him. He is someone who offers me his shoulder at all times when I am filled with dark clouds all over my head. Honestly speaking, I really do hope he's the kind that he would surprise me in many ways. But he doesn't. He is so not romantic. I'm a fantasizer of romance. "Happily-ever-after"'s romance especially. I do hope he will be a perfect man (even though i know man do make mistakes). Perfect in the sense that, he provides everything for me. He can provide shelter, survival needs (food & transportation), love, spiritual intimacy, physical intimacy (not sexuality pls- I'm talkin bout holding hands, wrapping arms,hugs and kisses), trust, faith about future, passion and a life ahead. I didn't ask for super good looking partner here but at least it's acceptable.  A man who desires for family after his career hours. That is truly amazing.   Love, Misuki

      Though I was upset about almost everything about my darling, but I could say one word... I will give time for him to change. If I choose to believe him , I have to do it. My eyes are so swollen and tired at the same time right now.   Yes, I rowed with him last night. Had the coldest war during dinnertime. Complained every single thing which I was dissatisfied with him. Hated it so much. Really... I couldn't stand it the way he treated me. But what could I do? I love him so much. Very much indeed. I felt this relationship is so one-sided coz I kept doing so much while I get nothing in return. All I want is love. All I want is just a mere companion by me. All I want is to be appreciated and loved at all times... Simple as that..   He wanted to end the relationship some how but I felt ending it is not a solution at all. He kept pushing me to make a decision for the both of us but I couldn't do so. I was down with heavy tears and I couldn't even mumble a word but to wail and wail ...crying out to God in my heart... "Why? I love this guy so much... don't tell me I have to end this relationship with him."   But somehow he neither want to see me suffer in pain. He knew I have many other burdens to carry around my shoulder. He didn't want himself to be a burden to me as well. I guess love really hurts.   When he told me that he said "that's it. end it" I really broke down terribly in tears. He wanted to walk out of my room but I caught hold of his leg and insisted him to stay. What is this? Even though I knew the problem between us is I don't feel loved by him and yet I refuse to let him go. I could see tears in his eyes, but he tried to hold back so hard. I just looked in his face with never ending tears, and sang....  "You have stolen my heart. I'm captivated by you... Never will you, undying Heart... I've fallen deeply in love with You."   I couldn't pronounce or sing in tune because I was crying for I love him...yes I do love him... but this means... I still have to choose to wait ... he deserves a chance... I cannot judge him right now and say no more to him... Right?

      Yeah...  Been truly upset since that day I knew he hasn't been real to me That's why I felt like walking away And never return again to him  Hearts broken, tears flowed Life is never like before From an empty heart to a naked soul Even though I yearn for more  He thought I gave him pressure He thought I cheated on him He thought I did things for pleasure Without realising my own dreams  Day by day the scar in our hearts widen From the minute we started to argue Week by week the relationship gets swollen To a tasteless heart we can only feel   Love isn't a heavenly thing When things doesn't work out well In his presence I hope my soul sings But I wonder where does my heart dwell  Love indeed hurts so much Hurts deep within our hearts How could I ever go on in this dark Wouldn't it be better to stay apart  Written by,  Misuki 12:55pm T204L

      Migraine has become better each hour after I slept from 1:30pm to 5:30pm.. wow the amazing 4 hours. I guess I will still be sleeping tonight for sure. It's not enough for me to recover my migraine and my health is not that good either.   I had to admit that I didn't have a good emotion for the past few days. Practically I wasn't contented with everything that  I have and i wasn't going through such a smooth life. Furthermore, to see my boyfriend up and down all the time wasn't that good... I really don't know when he can be good, when he can be nasty and yell at me. It really hurts me a lot. I seriously don't want him to be like that. He's taking me for granted. He keeps thinking I will be here for him all the time. Well , yeah.. at least he knows when I said I don't wanna cook means I don't wanna cook.   Ok, at least he did apologise to me about those nasty words he criticised about me. Come on.. I just want some words of appreciation like "Thank You, dear" perhaps.. that makes me feel better and can even bring a positive add-on mark to our relationship. Right, Bloggy? I really don't know how to say... like just now.. He said he wanted to use the pc all of a sudden when I was still using.. at least tell me nicely, gently. Instead, he yelled back when I told him I only need 2 minutes. I really hate him u know.. i mean.. hate the way he treat me...hot and cold at the same time which I cannot accept totally. How could he be so evil to me?  I mean, he knows I am fragile and versatile inside. I cannot be hurt anymore just like him... my scar is even deeper and u know I am the extreme type and YES.. I can go crazier than him coz my mental problem is even more knotty than his. Versatile girls had senile brains... that's me. Tend to think a lot and tend to have beyond imagination as well. That's me.. PISCEAn... fantasier of all time.   I really don't understand him at times. But yet, I just love to be with him. I just love to hug him, and kiss him every part of his body. Yeah, I just love him so much that I can't let go of him. But if he's too much.. one fine day he will know that i do not want to be the one-sided relationship girl here. ...

          OHAYOU!!!Sunshine on top of me dude,Come on... it's a brand new day. What can we say? damn.. I wish I am not in this local damned place.. I wish I am in overseas.. DAmneD! Oh Man... I watched Couples Fear Factor yesterday.. EWWWWW... it's so gross to put worms in mouth.. that is so so so disgusting and SPOOKY.. damn, wanted to vomit when I was watching that show.      GRRRRR... Well, I admit I lost contact with God for the couple of weeks ago, I think I need to redial the number and stay in tune with Him soon. He is knocking on my door and waiting for me to return just like the Prodigal Son in the bible.       Well Blogger, I do enjoy entering journals into you and I can't wait for my fixed line (wireless) phone to be fixed tomorrow and Yeah... I could enter as much journals as I want without writing them. I just need to login and type as much as I can.          You see, I am a girl..full of imagination and wonders that are beyond my cells and nerves of my brains. I just hope I could enjoy a life that brings me to seventh heaven to feel the ninth happiness like the people said, "Cloud Nine". I bet most of people today has already experienced it, but not me... What does happiness mean to me?      I can't answer that question. I have too many questions in my brains to answer. I have a lot of doubts and fears. Seeing me smiling sweetly at most of times, but in my heart it's crawling in bitterness for help. Come on, who will show their depression all day long? That will influence friends to ignore and indirectly we are discouraging them too. That is the reason why we smile all day... to cover the truth, to encourage people to be stay happy & cheerful throughout the day. But deep inside me, it's a totally No-No situation.       Who understands me best? No one. Not even my own family. Not even my boyfriend. Not even myself. I just hope God will unveil my heart and reveal His purpose for me. What can I do?      Now this reminds me that I can even pray online. If i dun feel like saying a verbal prayer to my Lord JEsus, I can even type it down here...down here at blogger, He reads every word I type, doesn't He?         Lastly, I am going to end this blog by saying I have a whole hard life of day to go through. Not to mention, I have an appointment with the Vice President of my college. Hope to have a nice chat wit him as he tries to unveil my hidden heart.

      Something said...  I froze with remorse, as those words of  hatred departed from my mouth, Words that should have never been said,  My heart was crushed to see your eyes fill with pain, I knew iI could never undo what was done, "I'm sorry " I whispered into the unforgiving night,  Knowing in my heart what was said couldn't be undone, I took a step forward but you  retreated into the shadows, retreating from me, The hurt in your eyes would haunt me  forever.  The guilt that I had inflicted  such pain was unimaginable,  Tension was all around the room,  I could feel your body tense up  as you say it's ok.  Seeing you trying to smile  made me cry even more.  Knowing that you love me so much to forgive me made me feel how lucky i was.

      Seasons of Prayer..   Summer of Love that breezes the air,  Psalm of praises flow through the waters,  Sunny it seems but a soul to bare  Spring has bypassed out endless prayers.   Grass withers and leaves of Autumn begin to fall,  Colours of golden brown that covers the streets,  Trees startled as Winter they need to prepare for,  Weather gets colder as I whisper the Apostle Creed.   Atmosphere turns the nature into a cold dry place,  As snowflakes pile up the earth  I try to seek the Lord in His grace,  Even though I shiver and look upon heaven above.   Praying for blossoming season to return,  Flowers bloom from one to another,  Seasons do change, yet lessons learnt,  But the word of God stands forever...

      Dear Bloggy,  I felt so exhausted at times. And at times, I just don't know what to do. I don't have a life at all. My life is filled up with working and studying.   U know what? I actually wanted to pour out as much as I can for my dear. I'm trying to plan out something the best for him for his birthday but the fact is I am out of cash. I wish I could entirely transform his exhausting world to a better one.  TOo bad, I'm not Harry Potter or Sabrina the Teenage Witch. But I will bless him with my prayers. God in Heaven will take care of him.   In fact, I really do love him a lot. A lot a lot until I can't even bear to let go. At times I do hate the times we fight and row about, and hate his procrastinating attitude. I wish he could be more responsible in his career & be more promising towards his words.    I really do miss those times being intimate and romantic towards each other besides the words of S*XUALITY!I don't want to get sexually involved with him but I would want him to be intimate and physically affectionate with me. For women like us, intimacy is spelled as TALK and HUGs not SEX like Men.   I really do wish when we could chill out together in highlands or vacations, just the two of us. Man, I don't know how long must I wait to get to that day.   I wish he could be with me all my life, loving him deeply each day, and yet... I wish he could love me even more. Care for me even more. Passionate for me even more. Waiting...waiting... yet.. still waiting. I know he has been hurt by me coz I dumped him twice but We got back together again. I've been hurt too by my past relationships. I am sick of pouring lots of love out but never get back in return. It shoulded be one sided relationship. BUt again, it's my fault to hurt him even though i have been hurt. I want to give him the best, but too bad I'm out of cash. I can't even help myself at the moment.   Truly madly deeply is what I could say love should be. And I hope he loves me that way too.   Love, Misuki

And I must prove that I can do it by Grace of God. I love him so much, even though I was so mad about him. I love him too much to let him go. But I will really give time for him to embrace his passion for me... I will not let go... I will not let go.. I promise me!!!  Love, Misuke

      Dear Bloggy,  I actually has a lot to say about my road nowadays. I just can't spill everything out from my head. There are so many things for me to say in fact. But I don't have the time to blog it all out. I don't know who else will be reading this blog except me, but I hope it does not reach someone whom I KNOW definitely. Thank God... i am in Japan, apart from all countries in this globe. Sadly to say.. my life is filled with bumpy roads and pot holes as well~!!  Throughout the whole week, I wasn't happy. I had been arguing a lot with my boyfriend. Hontouni Kanashi! Wakate rute.. I know he's got lots to deal with especially in his stepping-stone career & his stepping stone of financial foundation. One thing I wasn't really happy about was he's not ambitious. He is not prestigious in his vision and he prefer to lead a life with major simplicity. Not filled with a single complexion. To be successful in working society, one has to be far-visioned and beyond his imagination, he has to work all his way through. I wonder is he really learning anything from Accommodation Office of a private institution. Yes, I know his major criteria of working here is to be with me daily. But he's not learning anything and it's not worth at a long run. Last Saturday, he actually got an offer to interview in a bank, a position of Unit Trust Consultant was offered. But he rejected it. Damn! This is the saddest part of life I guess. How could he ever reject such offer? A offer of a lifetime where one does not always get a reply from job applications! His sickening excuses are still ringing in my head. "Don't like city life. Hate traffic jams! Wanna be far away from hustle and bustle of city life." These few excuses can be repeatedly playing in my mind for the past few days. Well I mean, in order to climb the corporate ladder, I don't mind all the hustle and bustle if I get a good pay and I can earn more for a better living in future. I mean... investment is a risk but whether it is worth the cost. I think it's worthwhile after all. Yeah rite.. claiming that his interpersonal skills is better than me. But the fact is, he deal with students more than people who are aligned with corporate affairs. How could he ever improve himself or his interpersonal skills in that Accommodation Office? Ahhh... PLEASE... Only he can self praise himself at all times.   I'm glad I was offered a  more permanent in this institution even though I am an undergraduate student here. At least I get to pay off my living cost without my family's savings. I get to lighten up their burden. Being a communications assistant in this business development unit, I think I had been really learning a lot. To be successful, one has to be humble, not shy to ask and holds a good command of language skills that impresses executives of all levels. I really thank God for my VP to offer me such post. Thank God for daddy who encouraged me to read a lot of books since young in order for me to master the command of English. Thank Jesus for being so faithful to me.   Even though I am filled with trials and tribulations, I guess God is just moulding me like how the potter shape its clay. My family is damned completely because of my dad's greed in business. My dad is not humble enough... perhaps GOd is teaching him to be humble. Financial critical condition has been with my family since 3 years ago and the problem has been worsen each day of my life. I've no longer claims monthly allowance since early this year. And now.. I've to pay my accommodation rental as well. At times, I do envy people who get to enjoy and study without working. But at times, I thank God for not anyone is special like me.. because I get working experience at a very young age. Not to be proud of myself, But I do have a vision of life. I see that God will bless me wonderfully after all these hard work and circumstances that I will face. I see myself climbing the corporate ladder step by step after I graduate. I see myself will be leading a major company in the city as a manager perhaps.. at the age of 28 to 30. I want to achieve that vision of mine. Climbing the corporate ladder is what I want. To earn more, and to save for a better life ahead. And yet, I could give... 10% to the Lord as tithe. This is me. I know myself clearly. I want what I desire. I yearn what I cry for. And I pray that the Lord will guide me to achieve my goals in a Christian way. By grace of God and mercy.   For my life partner, I know I hope that relationship will last. If my boyfriend knows how to treasure me well and appreciate every single thing I do, I seriously do not mind tying the knot with him in future. But if he always has this simple mind, living a simple life under a rented roof but not belonged... Forget it. Life is Survival.. To survive is to work to earn. I can't bear his costs like now. Food and groceries and petrol and etc.. at this moment, I might be happily, voluntarily paying for him. But in future, I know I will get tired of it and it's time for him to earn himself and, moreover, I am not earning a 4 digit salary like him now. I'm still a part time staff but at least I get to pay off my living expenses here sufficiently without any savings at all. There is no such thing of man-woman equality in being the breadwinner of the household. Man is always the one paying for the most of everything in a household. So do you think I would want to pay for his items anymore? He would take me for granted in future, and probably he would think.."Ahh..She will pay for me. She will provide for me. Saves my pocket!" AHHH.. If he dares to even think of that, I would really declare him as an 'Asshole'! ( Sorry Lord, forgive me for being rude & impolite and calling names but I'm really on my nerves at him at times.)  To be frank, i do love him a lot even though at times we argue like cats and dogs. And I have 'belonged' to him. He is someone who offers me his shoulder at all times when I am filled with dark clouds all over my head. Honestly speaking, I really do hope he's the kind that he would surprise me in many ways. But he doesn't. He is so not romantic. I'm a fantasizer of romance. "Happily-ever-after"'s romance especially. I do hope he will be a perfect man (even though i know man do make mistakes). Perfect in the sense that, he provides everything for me. He can provide shelter, survival needs (food & transportation), love, spiritual intimacy, physical intimacy (not sexuality pls- I'm talkin bout holding hands, wrapping arms,hugs and kisses), trust, faith about future, passion and a life ahead. I didn't ask for super good looking partner here but at least it's acceptable.  A man who desires for family after his career hours. That is truly amazing.   A road that I see in front of me, has a lot of bumps and potholes to go through.. but at the end of the road, I see a rainbow leading to heaven. Gracing the presence of God and angels rejoicing in His name, everPraising His Name forevermore.  Love, Misuki

      Life is full of bitterness & Sweetness. It all depends on how we embrace our life with sugar and spice. The people we encounter with are all of different heritage and backgrounds. What else can we say when I myself is special in God's eyes. Everyone does. Everyone is unique in God's eyes. It depends on how you want to look at it.  For me, I might be dealing with bitterness of life, encountering unforeseen circumstances and obstacles of life. Socially, economically, academically, mentaly, physically...yes... you can name it all. But as usual, humans are born to make mistakes and we are don't score a perfect 10.0!!   But I truly believe in God. I believe in God- The Father, The Son and the Holy Ghost will cover me with the blood of His Only Son who died on the cross for us, cleansing our sins so that one fine day, we will share the glory of His kingdom in Heaven. Salvation is Free and Jesus has saved us from the eternal Death. We might face death physically but our soul lives eternally in Heaven with Jesus.   We walk by faith, not by sight. That's what Jesus told us to. Believe and trust in HIM no matter what. Proverbs 3:5-6 told us about that. Psalms 37:4-8 mentioned about that too. We must continue to live in His light and pray unceasingly to avoid ourselves to drain into temptations of the evil ones.  Life which is given by God is already a blessing. But we need to praise God at all times, giving the best and glory unto HIs Name. And Yet, we complained so much. Thus, we must thank Him for wat He has truly done for us. Thank God for everything...  AMEN.. Praise the Lord...  Love, Misuki
