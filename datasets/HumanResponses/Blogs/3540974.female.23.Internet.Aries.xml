      "It's hard for me to say it" thats what he said to me... Darn..what have i done? I shouldn't bring up the matters..but this stupid mouth just slip it out. He sacrifice it for the sake of my relationship. Though i don't know what's in his mind..exactly. I'm gonna miss him.. big time !!I don't know whether he really wants it or just play a around.. Gosh.. can i lie to myself?   I'm so tired being here..  Suppressed by all my childish fear... And if u have to leave..  I wish that u cud just leave.. Cause your presence still lingers here... And it wont leave me alone..  These wounds wont seem to heal This pain is just too real.. There's just so much that time cannot erase.. When you'd cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all your fears.. i've held your hand through all of these years But you still have all of me..  You used to captivate me by  your resonating light  but now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me...  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone.. and though you're still with me.. i've been alone all along ....................... :"(

      Today i got my streamyx done. So happy about it and i've been downloading mp3s since i came back from work hehe... Ergh but kinda sad because all my cdrom are with my bf. I want to install ragnarok malay version at my pc. Oh well , i just have to wait for him to send it over... Still can't forget him.., tho kodok have make my feelings towards HH fading.. hmm but i hate to know that so many girls call up my bf even tho when we're dating. They really have no manners.. MF !! I think si kodok also layan them all,if not how come they want to call him? Erghh when i think of all that, i feel like i wanna clash. But erm.. like i said.. what i am now.., preventing me to go much further or making any quick decision. Even when it comes to HH, i'm restricted.., i can't go much further.. to know him or whatsoever. But deep down inside... i really really want to see him again and again..Err adios !
