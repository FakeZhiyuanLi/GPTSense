      I am soo tired. Yesterday was interesting. I went to my friend danielles house and her bday is on saturday so she is having at party at her aunts house. She is doing it at her aunts house cuz her sunts house is right on the river and she has a nice big yard. At her aunts house they have this big concrete pavilion thingy and it was caked with dirt .. like an inch thick. There were leaves and a bunch of sticks and shit stuck to it. So Danielle and i sat there for an hour and a half scraping dirt off the concrete thing. CHER IS ON THE RADIO!!!! sorry she just came on and i had to add that .. lol .. :) ! anywayz .. now after an hour and a half of cleaning for her party danielle said she might cancel it. I was kinda mad but thats ok ... its her party she can cry about it if she wants to. So afterwards we went to Bens house cuz we had nothing to do and we didnt want to go home yet. When we got there ben told us that he was expecting chip over so they could go to the mall ... so i was going to leave before she got there. But we ended up staying and going to the mall with ben and chip. It wasnt bad .. i had fun. Then we went to amys where we met amy, nate, alvin, and shaina. Amy suggested we camp out so we called jeremy and camped out in his back yard. It was unexpectedly very comfortable and i really didnt want to get up this morning, but i didnt have much of a choice. Amy and nate started throwing pillows and blankets on me so i couldnt move or breathe. them they proceeded to beat me ... lol but they always do that so its ok. Everyone except amy and ben are going to see spiderman 2 today and i really want to go but i cant cuz i dont have any money, but i am pretty sure i am getting my belly button peirced today so that should be fun! im excited!! oh well i think i wrote enough, im going to go shower cuz im a stinky kid. I'll write another post after i get my belly pierced.

      ok so today started out crappy cuz i had to wake up at 7 in the AM to go with my mom to take my sisters to school. Grrr. anywayz, but then it got a little better cuz afterwards from 11 in the AM til 1:30 in the PM i was alone, so i had time to rest and do whatever. Then i got to talk to Amy and Ben!! whoohoo! i enjoy talking to those two. I went to Pride over the weekend ... well for a couple hours on saturday. I went with a couple of my friends .. two of them were damn heteros, lol. Anywayz, while at Pride i saw this girl i liked last summer. she talked to me for a second then left. I thought there might be hope for me, but then when she left she was holding another girls hand. Which is cool. So since i got home from Pride i have been going crazy trying to find a way of getting a hold of this girl. One of my friends goes to her school and said she could get her phone number, but i know i would never call her. Then i decided to search on planetout.com to see if there was anyone in hazelwood or florissant who could give me maybe this girls e-mail. So i saw a girl who lived in hazelwood, and i was going to write to her and ask her but the profile i found ended up being the girl i saw at Pride. how convenient .. lol. Anywayz ... im done rambling. I should prolly go .. although i have nothing to do cuz i am babysitting my sisters :( . oh well.

      I went to the Tim Mcgraw concert last night at UMB. I had fun. I dont think Amy did although she said she did. Then of course the whole way back to Amys Tim was on the radio. It would have been rockin awesome if faith would have went on tour with him, she would have been fun to see :)! GOTTA HAVE FAITH! anywayz .. so now i am listening to Reba, shes awesome and i love her. If and when she comes to St. Louis i am def going to that one. I want to see Alanis when she comes with barenaked ladies, but i will be in virginia beach :( . I was halfway lookin forward to Alanis coming. oh well. Amy is going out of town tomorrow .. only for a few days but she will be missed, not just by me of course. I dont know what i am going to do for those days, everyone usually congregates at Amys but she wont be here. I'll find something to do. My b-day is Tuesday, the 13th. I am way excited. I will finally be 17 .. yayyy!! I cant wait til amy and i go to connecticut .. a week from today. I love going up there .... if i could live anywhere i would choose ridgefield connecticut, because i think its so beautiful. anywayz .. i am going to finish my Reba and find something on the internet that will interest me for awhile.

      I havent written anything in a few days and figured this would be a good time to do it. the last time i wrote i think was last thursday, so i will tell everything that happened over the weekend. Friday afternoon I went to Danielle's aunts house because Danielle and her family were camping out in the backyard for the weekend. Later that evening we went to Austins house because he was having his birthday party there. Afterwards we went back to Danielle's aunts house and went to sleep in a tent in her backyard. Saturday we hung out for awhile at Danielle's and shawn came over and hung out with us. Saturday night we went to the wentzville music pit cuz our friends band was playing there. I hate the pit ... i went there once before and it gave me a major headache and i didnt enjoy it. I tried to get some people to stay in troy with me while everyone else went to the pit but everyone wanted to go to the pit. which i dont understand cuz i know two of the people dont even like that kind of music. Oh well. Danielle and i had those little glow sticks that you put in your mouth and both mine and hers broke open and we ended up swallowing all the glowing stuff on the inside. No one cared about me but everyone was running to danielle to make sure she was ok. But i guess i am used to that kind of stuff by now. After the pit everyone went to Danielle's aunts house for Danielles birthday party. Danielle, ben, natalie, and i were all mud wrestling and covered from head to toe in mud but it was fun. I kinda didnt want natalie wrestling with us just cuz she is hotter than i am lol. oh well ... she did look good! everyone was gone by about 2 in the AM so danielle, ben, james, and i all went to sleep in the tent. ben and james stayed awake talking and i kept hearing them say my name but i was too tired to care. Sunday we hung out at danielles aunts house .. i was waiting all day for amy to call me cuz i was supposed to go with her and some other people to the river for fireworks and stuff. around 3 in the PM danielle checked her voice mail on her phone and realized we missed the call from amy .. who had called about 2 hours prior to that. I figured they went to the river and i was screwed so i didnt really bother too much with trying to get a hold of amy. Finally i did get a hold of her and went to the river with them. It was amy, rachel, chip, nathan and amy and rachels family. we parked on this sand bar (and boy it was huge .. lol) and shot off some fireworks and then later we watched the professional fireworks being shot off. It was awesome cuz it looked like they were coming right at me. I had a lot of fun that day. Sunday night i spent the night with amy and went home monday cuz i had to babysit my sisters monday afternoon. I ended up getting sick. monday and today i had a fever and a sore throat but hopefully it will go away and i will be good soon. Right now everyone is at the movies watching spiderman 2 and i really wanted to see it, but i looked like a lazy crack whore and wanted to be able to go home and change and stuff first. I was also sick and didnt know if i would be able to last through the whole movie feeling like shit. I ended up just coming home ... right now they are staring at a giant screen watching spiderman swing around .. oh i wish i could be there :*( . oh well. Hopefully amy will call me tonight and i can go stay the night over there .. but i dont know yet, well find out soon! i am going to bed, i am sick and should prolly get some rest.

      I finally got my belly button pierced yesterday. I have been waiting to get it done forever. Danielle and amy spent the night at my house last night, that was interesting. I cant entertain people so it was kinda boring, but thats ok. They survived so i guess thats good. I slept on the floor cuz i wanted to be nice and give my bed away .. now my neck hurts but it will be fine soon. I think it only hurts cuz of the pillows i was using. I really dont have much to type today. So i guess im gonna go!
