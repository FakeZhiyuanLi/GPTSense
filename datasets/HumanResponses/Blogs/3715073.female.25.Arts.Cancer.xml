      There are about thirteen days left until my twenty-fifth birthday. Finally, I'll be one-quarter of a century. I.Cannot.Wait. I'd even venture to say that unlike most young women, I'm actually looking forward to growing older or as I like to say getting better. Isn't that what comes with age- experience? And isn't "being experienced" better than having no experience at all? I'd say so.   I may not have done everything, but I've done a lot. I've lived in California, Texas, south Carolina, Georgia, and Panama. I've gone to college; haven't graduated, but working on it. I've experienced racism, classism, and sexism; and I am solid in views of where I stand in politics and the more social aspects of life. I've never been a mother, but I am helping to raise my little corner of "this village" that I currently live in. I'm developing my passion, my love, my affection for my natural affinity towards written and spoken word. I'm a poet, a philosopher, and philanthropist (although I'm as broke as a two-dollar whore, I give when and where I can; and besides doesn't every little bit count?). I've been abandoned, abused, blessed, cheated, hurt, loved, needed, revered, stressed, over-paid and under-worked (and vice-versa). Being that I spent most of these twenty-five years as someone's responsibility (ie. my mom), I would say that I'm getting better, older, and more experienced.  I've never been in love. Shocking really, when I think about it, because I can count with both hands and toes the number of men I  THOUGHT  I loved. But I now know and not necessarily from my experience, but learning from others', that I've never been  in   love. It's strange to me, because I always thought that by twenty-five, I'd have been in love, or at least be loved back, and neither has happened yet. I want it to-happen. I want to experience that right, ready to reciprocated, real-deal Holyfield (knocks you out) type of love, sometime in my next twenty-five.

      &nbsp;I'm getting laid off. December 17th will be my last day in this office working for this company. To date this has been my longest commitment. (with the exception of poetry) I cannot believe it's almost over. I'm not really sad, well for me but, a lot of my coworkers have families and people that depend on them for  something . I just have me. I'll be okay. I'm going back to school.

       Well, I said that if I had to sell pussy or plasma I would make the team. My new year's resolution was to make the team. I devoted all my energy in the first quarter of this year to making the team.   &nbsp;  I made it.  &nbsp;  I am a member of the San Antonio SLAM team. Yeah, I am a slam poet. I'd been on the open mic scene for two years before I first slammed. The first slam I ever attended was in December of 2002. In February of 2003, I was asked (after slamming three times) to be a host on the third Tuesday of every month. My life changed when I became host. I met traveling poets- I realized what I wanted to do, where I wanted to go with poetry, where I COULD go. Poetry began to take up space in my life, and people (in the poetry community) began to take me seriously. My performances improved tremendously when I started hosting, I learned how to effectively use my natural charisma on the mic- how to draw the audience in.&nbsp; I became somebody to somebody other than my mom and my friends.&nbsp;As my friend Charles Peters (of Mojoe @ mojoefamily.com) says- "The Devil put a spell on the mic when he saw me coming, can't live with it can't live with out it- artists do yo thang, but stay grounded."  &nbsp;  I'll be traveling to St Louis in August (two weeks from tomorrow to be exact) for the National Poetry Slam to compete against other slam poets from around the country. Established poets featured on Def Poetry and&nbsp;lil ole me; sharing a stage with Shihan (Hollywood), Anthony&nbsp;R Miller (Bay Area), Da'shade Moonbeam (Austin, Texas), Mike Mcghee (Team San Jose), and&nbsp; Rock Baby (Dallas).&nbsp; I'm scared. This is the first team/time for me- I'm a NPS virgin. And for the first time in my life I feel  uncertain  about poetry. This is a bizarre emotion for me because my poetry, my words, my free versed expressions&nbsp;are the only things I've been historically CONFIDENT about. Never before in my life have I ever felt so sure, so right, so needed, so necessary as I do when I'm on stage. And not because I am the best poet in the world because I know I'm not- but on the mic is the only time I feel free, uninhibited, for real. And I don't know that I'm ready to have that part of my ego challenged.  &nbsp;  I tried to explain this annoying paranoia to my teammates yesterday- to no avail, they think I'm just panicking, maybe. Highly likely since I've never really tested myself like this and I'll definitely be exposing myself to more people than ever- at the most I've performed in front of three hundred this will easily be three thousand people.  &nbsp;  I guess it's time to put up or shut up-  &nbsp;

      I am the  ORIGINAL  social butterfly. Two, three, four, five nights a week and the weekend, I'm partying. Anywhere there is a party going on, I'm SO there and I'm in the spotlight. From the time I hit the door I speak to everyone (who's anyone) in the spot. I hug, kiss, shake hands with everyone in the place. I laugh loud and often. I never really have a specific table or place to sit I just kinda float around from clique to clique blending in and standing out then disappearing, quickly leaving the group stunned like I have one of those neuralizer jawns from  MEN IN BLACK.  But my name isn't Will Smith and luckily I was born with my own personal neuralizer- my smile.   I'm always complimented on my smile. Oddly enough, my smile isn't exactly one of my favorite things about me. When I smile all I see is cheeks, dimples, and teeth- my face disappears. Sometimes I smile at myself when I am getting dressed, when I think I am REAL cute, I look in the mirror and practice the perfect smile. Not too much teeth, just a little cheek here, and dimples to taste. I'll even cock my head in different directions, different light and shade- so that I can see when and from what angle I smile the best.   there are days when I am not all parties and smiles. Days when I want to just be at home alone, not on the phone, not entertaining; just wrapped up in my plush white, down feathered comforter, on my couch watching a sad movie. Or a love story. Or a romantic comedy. Usually one of all of the above. Sometimes I will stay like this for days. Usually a weekend. And I will not go out, and I will not party. I will cry, or I will write. I will write about many things- usually about lost smiles.   Because of my butterflied status- the party girl- people who see me daily, or at least regularly, have a hard time dealing with my cocconed state. So a lot of times, when I am expected to BE somewhere or SEE someone or DO something- I put on my manufactured manic mask. And I'm back. Happy, fun, party girl again. And when I'm alone, in the safety and anonymity of my apartment- I am free to once again wear the melancholic mask, and since it's my own party- I can cry if I want to.

        I had so many things to say. I knew before I found myself face to face with you, that this moment would come and I wondered if I would have the nerve to actually recite the speech I've been writing for three years in my mind. We've never been formally introduced, but I know who you are- you're Taylor Mali. You changed my life. Picture it- December 2001, late one Friday night I walked in the door from my first open mic poetry reading- I'd rocked it and I was soaring, high off of the responsive audience that welcomed me with their open ears and arms. I flipped on the television to HBO, and there was the fudge flavored frosting on my chocolate on chocolate cake- poetry on teevee. The poem you performed that night, (I believe it was called "What I Make") moved me in away I could never describe with words. I'm an English major with a concentration in creative writing and a minor in Psychology- and dreams of teaching High School English/Poetry classes. I've never wanted to do anything else and after being sidetracked by life for the last few semesters, I'm returning to school Spring 2005. Two years ago, I became involved in the Poetry Slam scene in San Antonio; and this year I found myself faced with the prospect of meeting you again, in person this time. (I am a member of the 2004 San Antonio Slam team and I knew that at some point during the National Poetry Slam in St Louis- I would have my opportunity to thank you. When the time came, I choked; I let fear keep me from saying what was on my heart. So, this letter is for all thanks I couldn't say when I had my chance that first week of August- THANK YOU.
