      I had a GLORIOUS time tonight. For a moment there, I questioned whether or not "glorious" was even a word. Has it really been that long since we've been out of school? I've also, since school let out, forgotten whether the body part that sits on top of your neck is spelled "head" or "hed". Is there or isn't there an "a"? I forget silly things such as these when I'm away from school for awhile. I saw Harry Potter tonight with Barron and Pearce. Damn girls... these girls sat next to us that talked the WHOLE time! GR! Thanks to Pearce's "Geeeeze...", they decided to shut up. Then, Pearce's lovely fart silenced them up a bit! And created laughter on the row behind us...oh that was funny! I went back to Barron's, and watched Dr. Phil. Tonight's episode was quite life-changing, for some reason. It didn't really feel "life-changing" until I got into the car and started driving home. I started thinking about the girl on the show, she was 12, who was ashamed of her 15 year old pregnant sister. And her parents were giving the pregnant girl all the attention and taking all their anger out on the 12 year old. It was really sad. The 12 year old said she didn't want her dad to live with them anymore, because he added so much tension to the family. The dad actually admitted that he liked his older daughter more than his younger daughter. What a SICK man! But this wasn't the good part... the 12 year old was so adamant about how she felt. It was quite inspiring. She knows EXACTLY what she wants, and that made me want to know exactly what I want... she seemed like a smart girl, with great intentions, knowing exactly where she was going in life...it was pretty cool. So, I don't remember her name, Katherine? I dont know, but whoever she is...she's my newest hero.   Hats off to Katherine (is that her name?) and Dr. Phil, for changing my life!  By the way...this reminds me of a redneck joke...I think I might just make one up, because it reminds me of the "You might be a redneck if an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger changed your life." Well, I might be a redneck because an episode of Dr. Phil changed my life!   I love Barron

      What a stressful day! I woke up at 12:30, and went to my dads to feed his cat since he's in California. Then, I went and made Macaroni & Cheese at Barron's, watched a dog have puppies on TV (the most disgusting thing I've ever seen), and then came home. Now, I have to pretend to read for my reading class tonight. Or, I don't think I will. I won't even pretend to, because mom knows I'm not reading. Anyway, after class tonight, which ends at 6:30, I'm going to see Harry Potter with Barron and Pearce (his brother). So, that will be fun! I'm excited, even though Harry Potter isn't my favorite of all time, I feel the need to go, since Barron is going to sit through Shrek 2 with me, because I wanna see that movie. Even though I told my mom I had seen it already (long story), I just told her that "it was just THAT good!" Anyway, time to shower and stuff. Today will be a lovely day, hopefully tomorrow will be even better!  *Sarripoo "Song to be put on repeat" of the day (it has been for the past few weeks, actually): No Doubt - Sunday Morning Pointer: Don't put milk in Easy Mac, it doesn't need all that stuff, hence the name "easy" mac.  Another Pointer: Don't drink Pearce's "kool-aid". Pssht, yeah right! That stuff made me sick... it was good though :( I love Mandy Reynolds (and Barron O'Neal!) with all my heart!

      I'm excited. Overwhelmingly. Next Wednesday through Friday I get to babysit Elizabeth O'Neal, which means I get to play with Barron! Yay! Quite exciting. Thought I might share that with you. And by you, I mean Mandy, since she's the only one that has this site address, although Betsy Bond will know soon, when I talk to her, as well as Emily, who I will see tomorrow at my Speed Reading class...which is...lots of fun. But Emily's there! So that's fun. Anyway, I'm sleepy. It's been a long day, and a short night. So, goodnight my friend. (Notice: "friend", not "friends")  *Sarahloo . .  >      *       A kiss! How cute! Nobody's lips pooch out like that! Thats a weird looking face...

      All your "faults"!? Mandy! You're like the most wonderful person in the world! (Besides Minette of course) I most definitely enjoy our gossiping and talking bad about people. Those were the days... I LOVE YOU! Thank you for my tribute post, it made me quite happy. Let me know when you're free (or when you're not) so we can play, because there definitely needs to be playtime!  P.S.: Do you ever miss Daniel, Trey, Eric (even ERIC!) and Walter? Sometimes I do, no...wait...I don't. I guess I just miss the buttsex. Yeah, that must be it.

      Well, I read Mandy's blog. Not quite as exciting as I was hoping for. Well, maybe 'exciting' isn't the word. It wasn't as cheerful as I was hoping for. I don't know why I always expect things like that. I double click on the link on her profile for her blog, and I sit there waiting in anticipation... butterflies in my stomach... quick random thoughts running through my head "What's it gonna say today!". Well, today it wasn't happy. It made me... not happy. The anniversary is tomorrow (anniversary of a sad day for Mandy), that makes me really sad. It made me think about things, like about certain people not being here anymore. Like, what would I do? Mandy has literally changed my life, as silly as that sounds! It is something to laugh about, but it's quite true. I hated Magnet last year, I hated it with a PASSION! Then, Mandy came, and now I like Magnet a lot. So, if she hadn't of transferred from Byrd, I probably would have transferred to Byrd or Shreve, and then I would have graduated and gone to BPCC, because people who go to Byrd and Shreve don't know things (because I DO know things, obviously!), and I would have been stupid and I would have married a trash man and we would have had 10 kids, but I would have had 3 other kids from another guy, but I wouldn't know his last name. We wouldn't have jobs, and we'd be poor living in a trailor park. I'm super cool. This is the story of my life... without Mandy. So yes, I thank GOD Mandy is here today, for if she weren't, I could be looking forward to a bright future in my white trash trailor park. I love Mandy Reynolds.  *A tribute to Mandy

      First day of "work". Ick, I'm so sleepy... and WHERE is Barron! He's supposed to be home today! Where is that silly boy... Hm. Well, I think I'll go take a nap, and then go eat with my mom (and show off my hair). So, ta-ta!  *Sarripoo (A new Barron word)

      Yes, I have work tomorrow. Work consists of filing lots of papers at my dads office. At least the girls there are fun and "froo-froo" (A Beth Robinson word). I'm tired, and I do  not  want to get up in the morning and go to WORK of all places! Barron's coming home tomorrow, I'd rather spend the day playing with him and little Lizzie (his little sister, she's so cute!). Anyway, my day won't be fun tomorrow, but I think I'll be leaving work around 1ish to play with Barron. Wish me luck, I hope I make a lot of money.

      So, I got a new online journal, as you can see. I haven't been keeping up with my xanga as I should have been. I noticed it disappointed Betsy... poor Betsy! Anyway, so it's been a busy yet incredibly un-eventful summer so far. The only real exciting thing I've done so far was spend the night with Barron O'Neal at his farm house and get drunk. That was a LOT of fun! Except the hang over... horrible. So, I told my mom I was going to spend the night with Mandy. Barron told his mom he was spending the night with his friend Parker. Then, we met up and drove out to his farm, which is about 45 minutes away. It's a really cool place, we rode 4-wheelers and stuff, which sadly is something I've never done. So, it was storming really bad in Shreveport (we were in Keatchie) and my mom kept calling all worried that me and Mandy would get in a wreck. I, stupidly, forgot to warn Mandy of what was going on. My mom called her house asking how we were and making sure we were okay... BAD! Luckily, Mandy's a smart girl sometimes (hehe) and covered for me. So, around 9ish, Barron and I broke out the Smirnoff. Haha, that was fun. Smirnoff and gatorade. Definitely NOT the best combination, but it was great to get us drunk. And I think I drank mine a little too fast. Oh well, it was so much fun. We went to bed around 1 or 2, I dont know, I don't remember. The only thing I really remember clearly was waking up feeling incredibly sick, but not TOO sick. So, we left the house, and went out in the car and fell asleep in the car. Then, around 9:15ish, we started home, to Mandy's house, so she could take me home and look like I had been with her. We got about halfway home, and I started getting sick, and Barron had to pull over and let me puke. But I didn't, I just gagged and spit up. (Mmm, lovely picture) Anyway, I'm really tired right now. Barron's in Six Flags with his family, and that makes me sad. But he'll be home tomorrow. YAY! Well, time to go. I hope this entry makes Betsy happy!  This post should be deleted! I shouldn't drink, it disappoints people... including myself! But, it was fun.  Never  again, though,  never  again!  *Sarripoo
