						   Lolz... Marcus got a B3 for his 'O' levels MT. So happy for him. Tols him this Sat can go his home, he sounded so happy. Don't know he ask me go his home for what. but i think i can trust him. No, i believe i can trust him. But, if he let me down, i don't think i will ever trust anyone again. Scared already.  Got back my bio paper yesterday. I failed by one mark!!! Haiz... i aiming for bio-medical course. my bio cannot go down!!! Must work harder than ever.  Tired. Don't want to write anymore. End here then. Adios...

						   Came back from school today, felt so tired. Evonne nowadays very good to me, like treat me as a close fren like that. Wonder why, when i have never even talk to her when she was in school. Oh, i knew her when she was in school, but it's like, I know her name but i never tried to talk to her. Her bdae and Hanson bdae just passed. Wished both of them the happiest bdae ever.  Missed marcus alot. Never imagines that it would be so hard not to hear his voice telling me to take care and that he loves me. Michelle told me that she wonders why marcus broke with me when obviously he still care alot for me. Frankly, i also don't know. But, i'll be waiting. he promised me that he won't let me down. I'm scared i'll turn out to be something like michelle in the end. But... i'll cross the bridge when i come to it.  I'll end here today. Bye...

						   hmm... first time having a blog... guess i should start off with something interesting...  I started this blog because, i don't know, maybe bacause i really want somewhere to be able to write my deepest thoughts, my deepest feelings. Also, as someone has been pressuring me to have a blog, i guess that's why i finally gotten this blog. Umm... i'll keep this post short as i think i can foresee, my other post will be quite long. Whatever i will write here, for anyone who will ever sees my entry, please bear it ijn mind that, whatever i write down at that time, those feelings only lasted that long, negative feelings that it. Positve ones of course will last longer.  I think i'll end my post here. Adios...
