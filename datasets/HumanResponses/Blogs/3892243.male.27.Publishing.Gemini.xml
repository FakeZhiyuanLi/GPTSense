       urlLink    When I was little I remember seeing  urlLink Lone Justice  on SNL and falling in love with  urlLink Maria McKee . I wanted to grow up to be on TV wearing a pretty dress and wailing my head off. Over the years, after the demise of LJ, Mckee went solo and scored massive critical acclaim, if not much in the sales department, with  urlLink You Gotta Sin To Get Saved , a country-rock classic. After releasing the more guitar driven  urlLink Life is Sweet  in 1996, McKee took a break from the music business as she struggled to become independent of record label interference. She kept busy by singing on other people's albums, including the haunting  Sullivan Street  from   urlLink Counting Crows  debut,  urlLink August and Everything After . At the end of last year she released  urlLink High Dive  and a new era of her musical expression was launched.   BONUS:  Lone Justice's  urlLink  Drugstore Cowboy    urlLink

       urlLink    Well, do we see a theme evolving here? I really like songs that are reworked and lose all resemblance to the original. I never listened to  urlLink Black Sabbath  and used to whine and cry every time my ex-boyfriend would blast them in our apartment. To his sheer pleasure, when I purchased  urlLink First Band On The Moon  in 1996, he gloated for months that I was not aware that this was a cover by the aforementioned band. But that's ok, he also listened to  urlLink Phish  and that was a good enough reason to give him the boot.    urlLink

       urlLink    The first time I heard  urlLink Interpol  I just wasn't that impressed. In preparation for the Curiosa Festival, I picked up  urlLink Turn On The Bright Lights  and this song has hooked me. I can certainly hear the  urlLink new wave  influence all over this record. You know, there's this whole derivative argument about musicians these days, but you know what? At the risk of sounding unsophisticated, I like hearing the evolution and the influence of other bands. It reminds me of stuff I used to listen to and why I liked it in the first place.   urlLink

       urlLink    I'm having a very mild freakout over this song. I have been waiting patiently for the new  urlLink Fiona Apple  record for quite some time, but alas, it sits finished on the shelf at Sony because there seems to be some confusion on how to market it. Fiona isn't for everyone, I know, but those that do connect with her are extremely devoted. If the record company is nervous about recouping the cost of the album they could at least release it as a download only for the fans. I think that they would be pleasantly surprised in the sales department as Fiona's cult status has only grown while she's been away. The album was produced by the always brilliant  urlLink Jon Brion  who has been behind the controls of some  urlLink freakishly good albums .

       urlLink    If you have never been a big fan of country music,  urlLink Bramble Rose  is a great record to get your feet wet.  urlLink Tift Merritt  is sometimes referred to as alt-country, but all I hear is classic country without all the twang. The entire album is almost perfect, an incredibly strong debut that will be hard to top. This is my favorite song on the album and is my theme song of the moment.  urlLink Nick Hornby  of  urlLink High Fidelity  fame wrote about the perfection of this particular track in his collection of short essays about his 31 favorite songs,  urlLink Songbook .    urlLink

       urlLink    Often described as "too pretty to be punk, a little too raw to be pop, and a little too elegantly constructed to be rock & roll," I had the pleasure of seeing  urlLink Pretty Girls Make Graves  live several times at  urlLink NorthSix , which by the way is the ultimate place to see up-and-coming bands, but I digress. I have had their latest album  urlLink The New Romance  for a couple of months now, but guess what? It is not PC friendly and can not be played on my computer. So, it has sat on my desk unplayed. This track is from their debut  urlLink Good Health . Does anyone else hear a distinct  urlLink Fugazi  circa  urlLink 13 Songs  influence?    urlLink

       urlLink    Yes -  urlLink Talk Talk . The Euro Pop sensation that gave us the widely popular and recently covered "It's My Life". After the release of 1986's "The Colour of Spring", the British band took a new approach, creating two beautifully, emotional albums. Listening to these two works, one finds it hard to believe that this is the same band that was all the dance floor rage in the early 80's. Swapping synths for live organics, the songs exist far outside of the pop idiom, drawing instead on ambient textures, jazz-like arrangements, and avant-garde accents. This track, from the album "Spirit of Eden", is a beautiful example of how a band can recreate itself in the most wonderful ways.  These two albums have influenced (in my opinion) a range of bands, including  urlLink Bark Psychosis ,  urlLink Alex Lloyd ,  urlLink Catherine Wheel  and the below posted  urlLink Sigur Rós . Listen...and sigh.   urlLink

       urlLink    This Icelanic quartet has a niche for creating soundscapes - Big, melting chords, swelling strings and bowed guitars, emotive climaxes and hushed comedowns, with tiny samples and environmental sounds hovering on the threshold of hearing. Underneath it all is a slighty darker undercurrent. Reminiscent of  urlLink Radiohead  and  urlLink Godspeed You! Black Emperor ,  urlLink Sigur Rós   seem content to stretch out, unfolding their songs gradually.  This track is from thier 2002 release " ( ) " .Don't try to decipher thier lyrics as most of them, much as the  urlLink Cocteau Twins , are poetic gibberish - a fluid use of vocal sounds.   urlLink

       urlLink     urlLink The Killers  took their name from a faux band in a  urlLink New Order  Video. So, it would come to no surprise if you hear their synth influence with an injection of testosterone. Check out the video for  urlLink Mr Brightside  if you want to get a closer look at the Las Vegas based hipters. Sure, they look like  urlLink The Strokes , but their lyrics are much more discernable. The cool thing about the up-and-coming popularity of bands like The Killers,  urlLink The Rapture ,  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  and  urlLink Hot Hot Heat  is their utter dance-ability.    urlLink

       urlLink    A meloncholic ode to giving in.  urlLink Her Space Holiday 's atmospheric pop is a little gloomy, but there's a time and place for everything. This is the song that will comfort you as your lying in the fetal position on your floor after a long night of arguing. Well, that's what I  assume .   HSH's blend of electronica and indie, stellar beats, melodic guitars and  urlLink emo  lyrics are the perfect bridge between my two main musical tastes.    urlLink

       urlLink    Manchester England never seems to stop producing superb music, and  urlLink Lamb  is a fine example. A combination of various styles from within the electronica venue, Lamb can make you groove the floor or come to near tears. From the self titled debut in 1996 to last year's Between Darkness And Wonder, Lamb have produced high quality, thoughtful expanses of sound over and over again.  Little Things (Fear of Fours, 1999) is one of there more flat out Jungle tracks - backed with Louise Rhodes' masterful and haunting vocals, this, like many of their other cuts, has something more than a rhythm to move you - it has a message. Listen up.   urlLink

       urlLink    This ain't your granpappy's country music. Produced by the  urlLink White Stripes '  Jack White ,  urlLink Van Lear Rose  is a gripping reconstructionist version of Appalachian soul music.  White  doesn't attempt to reinvent Lynn, but instead gives her an updated dress and a new hair-do and makes her look better than ever. This song is the only duet between  Lynn  and  White  on the album and is very accessible for non-country listeners. It's a tale of drinkin' and lovin' - stuff of quintessential country, but with White's fresh take on the classic genre.    urlLink

       urlLink     urlLink Ivy  started out as a side project for  urlLink Fountains of Wayne 's  Adam Schlesinger . Their 1997 release  urlLink Apartment Life  is one of my favorite albums.  Dominique Durand's  sophisticated vocals intertwine with sweet melodies that convey a mixture of pleasure and pain.  urlLink Guestroom  is an album of lush covers of songs ranging from  urlLink Steely Dan  to  urlLink The Ronettes  to  urlLink The Blow Monkeys . This track is a classic by  urlLink The Cure , and most of the time, I would grimace at the very thought of someone taking something so perfect and ruining it. Luckily, their gorgeous interpretation is flawless.    urlLink

       urlLink     If I were 14, I would be in love with  Ben Gibbard , the singer for  urlLink Death Cab For Cutie . His earnest lyrics and cant melodic phrasing makes him seem just dreamy, like he's one of those guys that can't talk to a girl but he can write her a song. He probably spends extended amounts of time sitting on park benches or in coffee shops alone writing in his journal. He feels powerless and needs to be rescued. It's charming since I don't actually know him. But I have a feeling, if I did, I would probably smack him upside the head and tell him to be a man. Of course, this album's forlorn brilliance will probably not reveal itself to me until after my next break-up. Good thing I will be prepared for it.    urlLink

       urlLink    The  urlLink French Kicks  website labels them as part trashy New York rock, part D.C.-inspired post-punk, part mod-era Brit-pop. Well, I certainly hear the  urlLink Joy Division  reference in this track, but I'm not so sure about the others. They certainly aren't my favorite band to come out of NYC as of late, but they have their own sound going on and aren't conforming to the  urlLink electroclash  movement that has recently become all the rage (even though they have been known to play quite a few downtown art galleries.)     urlLink

       urlLink    The buzz around this eight member conglomerate is huge right now. But the real question is, "how the hell do you pronounce their name?" Well, mystery solved. According to their label bio  urlLink !!!  is pronounced as any three repetitive sounds. Common interpretations are chicchicchic, powpowpow, and uhuhuh, among many unlimited possibilities. All you really need to know is that this track will make you want to shake that ass. It's the perfect song to throw on at a house party to kick off the festivities. Everyone's heads will spin around as they turn to you and say, "what the hell is that?" Consider yourself warned.    urlLink

       urlLink    After a suggestion from someone on a message board, I recently checked out  urlLink The Dresden Dolls  and I have quickly become enamoured. Their burlesque style is frantic and whirling. They've been descibed as "cabaret punk" which probably comes from growing up studying classical and jazz, but also being influenced by  urlLink Black Flag  and  urlLink The Cure . They were scheduled to tour with  urlLink Lollapalooza  this summer, which would have been a great opportunity for the rest of the country to experience their mad stage act, but since it's been cancelled, it looks like the great North East will keep this little secret in their backpocket for a little while longer. Let's hope it's not too long.     urlLink

       urlLink    When the name Sinead O'Connor comes up there are a lot of things that people think about. They know she's bald, she did a kick-ass cover of the  urlLink Prince  song  Nothing Compares 2 U , she tore up a picture of the Pope on SNL,  urlLink Frank Sinatra  said he'd liked to  urlLink punch her , she declared she was a lesbian and she was ordained as a priest. What a lot of people missed out on through all the hoopla was that early on, Sinead rocked it. This song is a great example of that. She was the original  urlLink riot grrl  before the term became a media catchphrase. If  urlLink Avril  covered this song today, it would surely be a  urlLink TRL  blockbuster.    urlLink

       urlLink    Sad songs say so much. The question is "why do we get such comfort out of reveling in our misery?"  urlLink Leona Naess ' latest self titled album is a heartwrenching look at a failed relationship that just happened to coincide with her break-up with  urlLink Ryan Adams  last summer. She lays her guts out on the table for us to sift through and she gets a few  urlLink jabs  in here and there, but mostly she gives an honest account of the pain that's felt when your plans just don't work out, well, the way you planned.    urlLink

       urlLink    Did someone say "gimmie summin fun"? Well here you are. American Alex Gimeno has created his own vein of sound. I like to call it Lounge Electro Vibe (yes, you may coin that). Blending elements from his impressive LP collection using world and break beat cuts meshed with flutes, jazzy horns, big bass sounds, a touch of synth and Latin and hip-hop voice samples. Something for everyone...even dad.  Not bad for someone who started out as a comic bookstore owner.   urlLink

       urlLink    Even fans of  urlLink Rufus Wainwright  might not be aware of this little gem of a song because it's buried on the  urlLink Big Daddy Soundtrack . I have a funny story about how I came across it, but you wouldn't believe me if I told you.  Instant Pleasure  is a great song to play when you're done believin in love and you just want to go out and get it on. It's actually a cover of a song written by Seth Swirsky who has written songs for Celine Dion, Taylor Dayne, Tina Turner and Al Green. BUT, it fits perfectly into Wainwright's repertoire.    Bonus : Wainwright's version of  urlLink Hallelujah  from the  urlLink Shrek Soundtrack .

       urlLink    Some who know me might be aware of my devotion to  urlLink Ryan Adams  but I have made a promise to not turn this into a RA worship site. I just wanted to share with you a classic song from one of the forefathers of y'alternative (also, see  urlLink alt-country ). This song is about sitting at the bar after too many whiskey shots, moaning to the girl who fucked you over but you want her back anyway. We've all been there.   urlLink Heartbreaker  is a stripped down tribute to coming of age. It was Adam's first solo effort after the demise of the more angst-ridden  urlLink Whiskeytown . Adams is known around NYC as being a real A-hole, but he's welcome to be an ass to me any day of the week.      urlLink

       urlLink    Alright, STOP, collaborate and listen (hey, that's my second  urlLink Vanilla Ice  reference in less than a week - scary. But, I digress.) Seriously, listen to the track first and then we'll talk about it.  Now that you've heard it, let me ruin it for you.  urlLink Rachel Stevens  is a former member of the a UK cult, also known as  urlLink S Club 7  (uh, btw worst. band name. ever.). Anyway, I guess they had a tv show, or have a tv show, I'm not exactly sure, but they're like a boy band but with girls or something. And I think they were, or are, like some really big deal in Britain, but barely a blip on the radar in the good ole US of A. But I like this song. I can guarantee it would be a huge hit on a Sunday night at  urlLink Melange .    urlLink

       urlLink    Here's a blast from the past. Back in 1994, at the height of the  urlLink Grunge Era ,  urlLink Pavement  were  creating  the indie scene with their messy, jangly rock and  almost  confessional lyrics. Lead singer  urlLink Stephen Malkmus  made you feel like he was telling you a secret, it was just hard sometimes to figure out exactly what his point was. Back in the day when only your hillbilly uncle would be caught dead wearing a trucker hat, they were the original hipsters, with their too-small t-shirts,  urlLink cords  and shaggy haircuts.  urlLink Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain  introduced them to the MTV generation with the college radio hit  Cut Your Hair , but I always preferred  Range Life . It's still the perfect song to listen to as you make your way home from the bar - alone.   urlLink  BUY IT

       urlLink    I never had a taste for love songs until I discovered Stephen Merritt's  urlLink Magnetic Fields . Chances are, you haven't heard of Merritt or his music, but what you're missing, especially on 69 Love Songs (Three albums also available in the boxed set "Love"), is pure pop genius. Merrit creates completely original two and three minute songs that range in taste from gentle French pop (in the vein of  urlLink Belle and Sebastian  and the legendary  urlLink Serge Gainsbourg ) to urban beat tales, ala  urlLink Lou Reed . Add to that the fact that Merritt plays over one hundred different instruments on his album (from the uke to banjo to musical saw), yet, everything sounds simple and coherent.   Undoubtedly, one of the top ten records of 1999 - an unknown masterpiece that gets more enchanting every time I play it.

       urlLink    So this is our first reader submitted selection. Not bad for only being around for about 48 hours.   The first time I listened to this song I thought the singer was a snarling man. I was wrong.  urlLink Jennifer Herrema 's vocal stylings make me feel kind of grimy and smacked out. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  urlLink Royal Trux  was one of the many bands that came into being after the demise of  urlLink Pussy Galore . This song is a far cry from the noise rock they started out concocting, but closer to what  urlLink Virgin  probably wanted from them when they signed them in 1994 as part of the  urlLink Nirvana  knock-off period. It didn't take them long to find their way back to an indie label.  It's been hard finding any info on the band, I think Jen and  urlLink Neil Hagarty  may have parted ways, but according to  urlLink Drag City , their record label, a new album,  urlLink Transmaniacon , is due out in September. And you can take that to the bank.

       urlLink    I wouldn't say that  urlLink Komeda  is following in  urlLink ABBA's  footsteps, far from it, but as they are the only other Swedish musical import people cannot help but compare - until they hear them.    Pulling from almost every vein of music imaginable, Komeda manages to weave a very tight mix of an overwhelming amount of sounds. In Komeda's smoothest moments, there's a vague resemblance--heavy synthesizers, infectious melodies--but even then they tend to be more energetic than  urlLink Nina Persson and her compatriots , their tunes infused with a compelling excitement. At their wildest, in performance, you might be reminded of  urlLink Devo . With good old-fashioned drums/ bass/ guitar pushing things along underneath the layers of futuristic keyboards, it's clear that Komeda like to rock (and this doesn't even quite describe the sound).  This multi-talented, jazz-rock-pop addicted gang is one of my all time favorite best kept secrets. Pop on!

       urlLink    In honor of the relase of  urlLink One Plus One Is One  by  urlLink Badly Drawn Boy  (Well, at least in the UK - no word on an American release date yet) let's revisit a classic from  urlLink Have You Fed The Fish?   The Further I Slide   is groovy and sexy and the perfect song to turn on Saturday afternoon around 2PM when you're rollin' out of bed with that special someone. It's quirky and sentimental all at once. All horns and smooth funk. Keep it comin' my way.

I'm smitten.  urlLink Jem 's debut  Finally Woken  has been described as  urlLink Beth Orton  meets  urlLink Dido . She even wrote  Nothing Fails  for  urlLink Madonna 's  urlLink American Life  album. But hey, we won't hold that against her.

It seems every hipster I meet knows them personally and thinks they're the greatest thing since sliced bread.  urlLink Ben Nichols ' raw vocal stylings suggest he's smoked one too many Camel Wides himself, but they are heartfelt and heart-breaking. According to  urlLink Jen  (who I yanked the song from), there will be an impromptu show on Tuesday night, at 7:30 p.m. outside  urlLink Last Chance Records . Be there or be square.

I like to read about music, but hate it when I keep reading about certain music and have no idea what it sounds like. The focus of this blog is to put together a collective of Memphians to post MP3's and write about the music they're digging. We'll also try to bring you event info and reviews of Memphis bands and DJ's. Let's see what happens.

       urlLink    So here's a really great reader submission from  Dennis . I would have posted it a lot sooner, but our gmail account has been acting out the past few days. In better news, the president of a bank in Nigeria has finally tracked us down to inform us our long lost cousin has left us a substantial amount of money.  In regards to  urlLink Jolie Holland , the Texas native is now living in San Fran, and  urlLink Escondida , her latest album, has been labeled as one of the best debuts of 2003. She's aiming for her next project to be "a pristine Jazz-slash-Country record with dance songs you could imagine couples dancing to wearing tight jeans."

       urlLink    Seriously, one of my favorite bands, albums and so terribly underrated it's criminal. Back in the early '90's when I used to hang my hat in Music City, I'd see  urlLink Fleming & John  every chance I got at dives like  urlLink Exit Inn . They haven't updated their website in years, but I know they sometimes work on other people's records like fellow former Nashvillian  urlLink Ben Folds ,  urlLink John Mayer  and  urlLink Train . The Benmeister co-wrote and played on another great song on  urlLink The Way We Are  -  Ugly Girl . I hear they're still in Nashville playing house with a kid or two. I hope they get bored with that soon.

       Two DJs from Berlin with only one album on their discography, BUT they have also done a Nike commercial as well as remixes for Saint Etienne, Pizzicato Five, Herbert Grönemeyer and Andreas Dorau. But don't get all excited,  My First Political Dance Album  is a horribly cheesy electro-dance-pop project with delusions of adequacy. However, there are a few saving graces that would compliment sushi and cocktails at the hipster bbq. One exampling being this featured track - a hip, organ driven little ditty that's good for da booty. Just don't take this track or the rest of this album  too  seriously - they didn't.   (Three in one day...wow. Guess I am makin' up for not posting for a few days. Carry on!)

       For those of you that don't know, Mark Griffith, otherwise known as MC 900 ft Jesus, is a subtle, poetic, multiple personailtied genius. Alongside his musical collaborator DJ Zero his musical styles range from electronic house to psycho hip-hop to jazz to spoken word that all questions the validity of a society gone mad. His distinctive vocal style could hardly be described as rap in conventional terms, and reflects more the spoken word narratives of the beat poets.   The moniker comes from a vision the evangelist Oral Roberts claims to have seen. A giant 900 foot jesus spoke to him and told him not to worry about being broke.    This track is a B-side to the track  Too Bad  from his first release  Hell With The Lid Off . The story behind this track and where Mark found this rather irate woman is unknown - but dayum has she got a mouth  on her!

        Mark Nishita, a.k.a.  urlLink Money Mark , is a hard man to pin down. If you recognize the name, it's most likely because of his role as the fourth (or is it fifth?)  Beastie Boy  from the days of  Check Your Head  on, but he's been doing his solo thing all along.   This track pulled from the album  Change is Coming  is a more laid-back, jazz hole of a project for him - the sampling and weirdness have really taken a back seat this time out. There are a surprising number of "traditional" instruments here, including congas, guitars, saxophone, and flute, making Money Mark feel more like a bandleader than anything else. The album is strictly instrumental, for one thing and it delves into retro-sounding jazz/funk/salsa with an awe-inspiring intensity. It's a testament to his skills as a songwriter and all-round musician that Nishita's keyboard tends to sit in the background on most of the tracks; heck, a few of them, like "Information Contraband", don't even have a keyboard (well, okay -- if it does, I can't distinguish it from the guitars). This is less about a showcase for Mark's keyboard skills than it is about the music, and that's a very good thing.   If you are a fan of The Beastsie Boys earlier works, especially the instrumentals, grab this album with haste! Everytime I put it on, I have an overpowering urge to take a long, slow, even-paced & groovy road trip to California.  NOTE: LINK FIXED - opps....

        The Giant Step crew from New York has made a name for itself through unforgettable dance parties as well as through marketing acts that fall just below the radar of mainstream soul and jazz.&nbsp;The new compilation&nbsp;rounds up a number of acts whom Giant Step has released on its own label or promoted and distributed to the U.S. market. Whether it's the gorgeous future-funk of West London supergroup DKD with Donnie on "We Can Make It," the analog soul of Detroit's Amp Fiddler, or the Santana-like RSL ("Wesley Music"), Giant Step's motto covers it all: Simply good music.

       Yonderboi seems to have an innate talent for paying tribute in a classic and yet original way. He has brought the underground sound up to the surface without losing any of his uniquness. Floating around a trip-hopish, house tinted, jazz laced wonderland, he has created music for perfectionists...music with a feeling...music from the heart...  Pulled from his only full album release to date "Shallow & Profound"

       urlLink    So after my  urlLink Jack White sighting  over the weekend, a little research has led to a lot of interesting stuff about music being recorded in Memphis. Is it the premiere place for making a great record outside of NYC and LA? According to this excerpt from the  urlLink Denver Post  - it just may be:   Modest Mouse recorded its brand-new album, "Good News for People Who Love Bad News," at Easley. The studio had an amazing run in 1994-95 with the recording of Wilco's debut, "A.M."; Pavement's "Wowee Zowee" (Easley got a pedal steel credit); and Sonic Youth's "Washing Machine." Other artists that have laid down tracks here include Big Star, Jeff Buckley, Guided By Voices, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Cat Power, Iggy Pop, Mr. Airplane Man, The Promise Ring and local-boys- made-good The Reigning Sound, whose "Time Bomb High School" topped many best-of lists in 2002.  Detroit garage rockers The Gories also recorded at Easley. The group's 1995 release, "I Know You Fine, But How You Doin'," with Alex Chilton at the boards, could have been what drew the White Stripes here a few years back. It's where Jack and Meg White recorded "White Blood Cells," the album that truly broke the Detroit kids into the mainstream. And while Easley is intensely proud ("Just try and find another gold-selling record that was recorded for $2,000," he said), he's not boastful.  "The White Stripes broke through the barriers, and that fits right into the Memphis mold of things that shouldn't have happened," Easley said. "I've had calls from a bunch of crazy people - Dylan included - but things just never panned out."

       urlLink    The new  urlLink Fiona Apple  - blah, blah, blah. That's how  urlLink Rachael Yamagata  is being sold to the masses. I like her, but I don't like the sale. How annoying. Just like a Hollywood pitch. It's gotta be like a "hit" meets a "hit." Nothing's original, nothing's new, it has to be repackaged and resold to us so that we stay in our comfort zone. I guess my point is that I hate being marketed to (unless it's an infomercial, I lourve infomercials), and if I see it coming, I ususally steer clear. There's nothing that can ruin good music more than an image. Although, image can sometimes steer us toward certain things that otherwise we might not have noticed. I was with my friend at Tower last weekend and picked up a CD to purchase when she asked me what the band sounded like. "I dunno" I replied, "but the cover is cool." Anyway, Yamagata is pretty deck, even if she does spell her name wrong.   No, I'm not drunk.

       urlLink   All bow down to the not so well known queen of Hip Hop, Bahamadia. Comparible to Digable Planets (who need to release another album soon thank you), Bahamadia has a lot to say and moves my butt to boot. Since Kollage (the album from which this track is pulled, Bahamadia has collaborated with a number of artists for both hip-hop and cross-genre tracks. Along the way, she worked with the likes of The Roots, The Herbaliser, Sweetback, and Morcheeba. Such collaborations widened Bahamadia's creative scope.   As Bahamadia breaks down the science behind her lyric writing, she elicits, "I'm more attentive to what I create because I have to research and actually live the experiences and then I can filter, take my time, sit back and write the songs."

       This is a bit unusual. Here is an entire mixed set by house music legend Larry Heard. It will take a while to download, but it will give you a hell of a history lesson. The set focuses on later-era disco and early-80s dance music (the primordial ooze that became house and then everything else electronic and dancy). I have a hard time listening to mix sets these days (having heard upwards of 10 trillion), but Larry's disco set is so much fun!   Those of you unfamiliar with  urlLink Larry Heard  should know that he is one of the forefathers of house music; that is, he helped to start the genre in clubs like the Warehouse in Chicago circa 1985-86. He's a kind of unsung legend who now does production work for all kinds of unusual folks from his home in Memphis.   This post is part another of my attempts to bolster the Memphis music scene, albeit unusual. Larry is now local, but more importantly, the set is hosted at the website of a fledgling local house & nu-jazz label:  urlLink deltajack.com .

       Putsch '79 is made up of two guys from Finland. They're on a Dutch label ( urlLink Clone ) They sound unmistakably like they are straight from New York City circa 1981. I guess that means they sound like Metro Area... and they do. But, as far as I am concerned, there is plenty of room for that. "Penguins are Deep" is a cute electro-disco thing with a driving Larry Levan style baseline and some neato synth noises. It's fun. I love Putsch '79. It's time to go home.

       This post is a little out of character for me (as if many would know or care), but it is more local stuff (see last post) and someone asked for it (see comments from the last post).  Here's a garage burner from the Reigning Sound, a song that is very much in character for Greg Cartwright and crew. These guys have scattered to the winds. They've all moved all over the country, claiming several times that the band would dis-band after the release of "Too Much Guitar." They're on tour right now, and I keep seeing Greg skulking around Memphis' dusty record shops (one of which he used to own). So, maybe there isn't so much stock to be placed in their comments.  The last time I spoke to the (now former) drummer of the this band, he told me (over far too many cocktails) of the American military bases on the dark side of the moon and other high points of the far-reaching Luciferian conspiracy that has characterized American government from the getgo.

       This blog comes from Memphis, but there has only been one entry for a local artist (Lucero... Mr. Airplane Man almost counts, as one of the girls moved here). This entry is not just an attempt to remedy the dearth of Memphis artists on this Memphis blog; the song (and the album from which it is pulled) is phenomenal.   Harlan T. Bobo's "Too Much Love" is the best recording to come out of Memphis in quite some time. The fact that it is totally self-produced and released (along with interesting posters touting the CD's availability in "less discerning record stores" and a childishly disturbing coloring book) makes "Too Much Love" even more desirable. Plus, each CD has a hand-made, one-of-a-kind cover.   Harlan is a local artist and bassist ( urlLink Viva l'American Deathray Music ) that came out of nowhere with a collection of grinding, dixie-fried laments in the traditions of Nick Cave and Tom Waits. "Too Much Love's" titular anthem is my favorite; I am a sucker for organ. It's a drunkenly (on whiskey, of course) creepy little love song that wears the two aforementioned influences on it's sleeve while announcing it's uniqueness with tones of Memphis garage and lyrics that no one else but Bobo could write.    EDITOR'S NOTE: Harlan T. Bobo will be playing at Earnestine & Hazel's Huricane Elvis Party Saturday Night along with Impala and Royal Pendeltons!

I can't wait to hear their new album which is scheduled for release in August. Anyone else heard it yet?  The wonderful vocal stylings of Miss Jenny Lewis can also be found on  urlLink The Postal Service  album, and you know how much I love them. If you live in NYC or SF, don't miss their upcoming shows at  urlLink The Knitting Factory  and  urlLink Bottom of the Hill  respectively.

      It's been a great first month! Thanks for stoppin' by. I came across this post today. Here's why we exist:    04:08 pm - Gee, Ricky, I'm real sorry your mom blew up.   11 am: downloaded "Heaven or Las Vegas" by Cocteau Twins and "Come Pick Me Up" by Ryan Adams from Scenestars.  2:30 pm: stopped by Dog Ear and bought Heaven or Las Vegas by Cocteau Twins and Heartbreaker by Ryan Adams.   I am anecdotal proof that filesharing is NOT responsible for the downturn in the music industry's profits. Hmmmmmm....  Also, please tell me that that woman in the Cocteau Twins is not singing in English? Current Mood:  lonely Current Music: come pick me up, take me out, fuck me up, steal my records..

       urlLink    I've never been a huge  urlLink Prodigy  fan, but in the great tradition of "putting out," I thought a few of you might be interested in hearing a track from their forthcoming album  urlLink Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned  which is slated for an August release.   I mostly liked their old stuff more than anything they've put out in the past 6 or 7 years.  Damn! How pretentious did that sound?  But, seriously,  urlLink Experience  hit at the height of the  urlLink American Rave Scene  and was a great techno record, back when they were fun. Then they went and got all dark and freaky which wasn't the greatest thing to dish out on a bunch of kids all spaced out on the drug of the moment.  Liam and Noel Gallagher are featured on the new album along with  urlLink Juliette Lewis ,  urlLink Kool Keith ,  urlLink Princess Superstar  and  urlLink Twista . But the hypest thing about the whole album is this song that references my 'hood. How the hell did that happen?

       urlLink    Believe it or not,  urlLink Stereolab 's  urlLink Dots and Loops  is the perfect road record. I picked up a copy of the cassette at  urlLink Vintage Vinyl  (who, BTW, always has great in-stores) in St Louis for a couple of bucks in 1995. Some friends and I were on our way back from a Beastie Boys show and since we had worn out their albums on the way there, we were ready for something totally different. When we finished listening to the entire album, instead of changing records, we flipped the tape over and listened to it again, and again, and again - for four hours straight.   Stereolab allows you to zone out to another world and get lost in your imagination. Subliminally, they're ingraining you with Marxist political theory, but on the surface it's just straight  urlLink Space Age Bachelor Pad Music .

       urlLink    Since yesterday we gave you something brand new, I thought today we'd kick it old school and dig one out of the bins.   The ethereal  urlLink Cocteau Twins  are the perfect music to listen to after you get home from dancing at a club until 6 AM. At least, that's what I used to do. Their music defines a mood not an idea. I tried many times to determine exactly what Elizabeth Fraser was singing about until I finally learned that just like  urlLink Sigur Ros , it's her very own made-up language.   If you are already a fan of Cocteau Twins, I'm sure you know about  urlLink CocteauFest 2004  coming up in September. With Cocteau Twins cover bands and DJ's spinning the latest remixes, it's bound to be a fun night. See, LA's not so bad afterall.

       Somehow this fell in to my hands. Here's a track from the forthcoming Interpol album, "Antics," entitled "Length of Love." If the comparisons to Joy Division were accurate before,&nbsp;the new&nbsp;album - especially&nbsp;track 9 here&nbsp;- will be causing the complete resurrection of Ian Curtis. Perhaps it already has. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Maybe Interpol's vocalist, Paul Banks,&nbsp;has been&nbsp;channeling Ian all along... But he just seems too clean. Would Ian Curtis&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;revisit the earthly plane&nbsp;through&nbsp;a French guy who wears Gucci and is probably too weight conscious to drink a lot of beer?&nbsp;Curtis was&nbsp;music's most famous flamboyant depressive, but he was from Manchester for Christ's sake...  &nbsp;  "Length of Love," is steeped in the sounds that cause Interpol to be compared to Joy Division and The Chameleons, but it's little more rhythmic than usual. There's more bass, and it's more driving. It's almost dancy - in that New York No-Wave/Franz Ferdinand&nbsp;fashion - but "Length of Love" remains totally over-affected in that special way that sets Interpol apart and makes them great.  &nbsp;  I love Interpol. I don't care if they are on Mtv2.

        From the ashes of Arthur Russell, PiL, and The Idjut Boys comes  urlLink Out Hud . Their First and only full-length album, S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. (2002), completely reinvented the often-pretentious "post-rock" genre and made a lot of noodling, avant-jazz boobs wonder what the hell they'd been doing for ten years - at least that's my opinion. It's one of the best records I have ever heard... That's not an exaggeration.    "Dad, There's a Little Phrase Called Too Much information" is a great, organically performed housey number that ambles around the stratosphere while remaining dance-able. Plus, it has a great title that seems as if it were pulled from some forgotten, early '90s, Mary Kate & Ashley Slay the Cave Beast videotape.

       urlLink   Confession time. I read Entertainment Weekly. I'm not proud of it and I've been trying to get into a 12-step program to ween myself off the junk. I know that it's a terrible habit, but what they never tell you about on those after school specials is that it's really really fun. Not everyone ends up out on the streets friendless. I mean, I swear I only use it recreationally. I can quit anytime I want.   The reason why I don't is because sometimes I come across little gems like  urlLink Tilly and the Wall . Without EW I would have never known that they're on the excellent Conor Oberst's label  urlLink Team Love  and that you can download their complete first album for free. So, I'm keeping my EW for now. Society be damned.

       urlLink   When I was a wee one and first became enamoured with a certain band or singer, many times an older brother or sister of a friend would ruin the high by saying, "They're totally ripping off so-and-so." I would argue that whatever music I was listening to was totally original, because that's what I wanted to believe.   The other night I was listening to Franz Ferdinand and my brother says, "They sound just like The Pixies." I hate it, but I am also beginning to become one of those people that hears the musical influences of bands. I blocked it out for so long, but the older you get and the more music you've heard, the harder it gets. I would be willing to bet you a dollar  urlLink The Realistics  have listened to some  urlLink Squeeze  in their time.

I was lucky enough to see them in a shitty little club with only about 10 other people after the release of  urlLink Get Skintight . Their set was kind of awkward, but you could tell what they were going for. They're like the female version of The Ramones with really sharp lyrics and tight guitar licks that make you want to rock out. It's music to drink beer to. Not that I drink beer.

        "Nerves" is the a-side of the near-impossible-to-obtain new EP by Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani, "Metro Area 5." The Environ label - of which Metro Area is the crown jewel - has remained admirably small and independent, but unfortunately, that means the vinyl is produced in small supply... Dammit!  Geist and Jesrani never fail to demonstrate a sense of innovation had by a precious few in electronic music. They reach both backward - to the tail-end of electric disco circa 1980 - and forward - to something unremembered and beautiful. "Nerves" inches their sound ever-onward and continues Metro Area's habit of somehow always outdoing their last release (a feat that I would think impossible). As usual, "Nerves" is a slower-tempo track that has the frenetic sexual energy of forty-five rabid Baboons in estrus.   If I had to pick a favorite artist/band/what-have-you, Metro Area would be it. That's enough praise; listen for yourself.

        I First heard  urlLink Moloko  waaay back with the track "Fun For Me". Laid back, deep grooves with that old timey radio voice thingy-ma-bob. Years passed and I looked them up again and ran across the album "I Am Not A Doctor". A neato electronica gig with a hint of Funkadelic. They tend to flirt with Drum and bass often, this track being an example.One word of caution, if you dig this track you more than likely will NOT enjoy their two latest releases - as their "creativeness" has turned into what I commonly call  poo . Now go get some sun - you look a tad pale.

        Felix "da Housecat" Stallings' new album, "Devin Dazzle & the Neon Fever," is far from the groundbreaking masterpiece that was 2001's "Kittenz & Thee Glitz," but it still stands out as a song-driven, crossover dance concept album (a mouthful). It's definitely worth owning...   "What She Wants" is my favorite track on "Devin Dazzle," and that's probably because I am very partial to James Murphy ( urlLink The DFA  &  urlLink lcd Soundsystem ), who lends his super-no-wave vocal stylings. The song comes off sounding like something from the  urlLink DFA label  (which you should definitely check out if you like this track), with it's disco-esque baseline and pure reliance on repetition for dance-ability. "What She Wants," along with the rest of the spate of new music that mysteriously marries house and indie-rock, nostalgically expands upon the undiscovered New York "disco-punk" of the early 80s - possibly to its detriment - but I, myself, cannot get enough!

       urlLink    I first heard  urlLink The Postal Service  in a record store. I was busy flipping through the bins, minding my own business when all of a sudden I looked up and yelled across the store, "Who is this?"  It wasn't until later that I realized the record was a collaboration between  urlLink DCFC 's Ben Gibbard and  urlLink Dntel 's Jimmy Tamborello. Well, that explains it. Anyway, I went straight to the P's, picked up  urlLink Give Up  and purchased it. It was just like what love at first sight must feel like. Sometimes you just know.

        "Um, excuse me, would you mind to... pump!" I think that's my favorite lyric in the history of popular music. But it could only be delivered by the inimitable  urlLink Miss Kittin .  On "Requiem for a Hit," Kittin joins with the production team of Tobi Neumann and Thies Mynther (read  urlLink Chicks on Speed  &amp;  urlLink Peaches ) and vocalist L.A. Williams (techno emcee of limited note) for a stripped-down, nasty, 9-foot-funk-ass homage to classic Detroit that had me digging for DJ Sneak records the first time I heard it. Miss Kittin claims her rights as techno's little Teutonic darling by playing to its very roots - albeit American roots - and it is pulled-off more genuinely and enjoyably than it could have been by Sneak himself. Kittin apparently made the right calls and put the right names on the guest list (her specialty) because, as usual, the cute little super-diva has exquisite backup.      "Requiem" is the most fun thing I have heard in a while, and it (along with the rest of the I COM LP) has become the record for me to remember this summer by.

        German based Tocotronic is one of the most potent indie bands in Europe. This remix--remake, really--by Console, is a pulsing blips-and-bleeps electro pop tune that rivals Console's best stuff. Atop Lo-Fi analogue-synth waves reminiscent of early Human League, Gary Numan or Visage--or more recent retro-electro acts like  urlLink Ladytron  and  urlLink Lowfish --With vocals provided by the synth underworld artist  urlLink Miss Kitten , the coherent whole is brilliant, propelled along rather than aimlessly gurgling, and retaining Tocotronic's short pop structure. Pulled with love from the 2000 EP release with the same name.

       urlLink    I am still surprised that  urlLink Sterophonics  have not been more popular in the US. What's so cool about them is how straight forward their music is, they never sound like they're trying. The music is catchy without being annoying and is perfect for driving up the coast on a Sunday afternoon in the summer. Or, if you're not on a coast, it's fun to listen to while you drive to  urlLink Target .   This track is a couple of years old from the very excellent  urlLink J.E.E.P , check out a clip from their latest single  urlLink Moviestar .

       urlLink    I've been waiting for these guys to break big for a couple of years. When their debut  urlLink This Tennessee Fire  was released in 1999 they were slated to be the next big thing, and they  were  on the underground cicuit - but mainstream success has eluded them. Their music is indie-rock for mid-westerners, alt-country for goths, the origin of wearing a trucker hat with no irony. I think the hold up on them being wildly popular is people's reluctance to like anything that hasn't been pre-determined cool by others. I mean they're from  Kentucky!  Are we allowed to like a band that's from Kentucky?

       urlLink    Ok, so I am way late on the scene with this one, sometimes life just gets in the way. All I know for sure is that now the second track has leaked, I am about to wet myself with anticipation for this album. It reminds me of when  urlLink Scarlet's Walk  leaked, it didn't matter that I had the full album a month before it was officially released, I was still in line at midnight the night it went on sale. Until I had that little plastic container with the artwork in hand I just didn't feel complete.   P.S. I think this may be a rough edit and might not be the final  better version  on the album - if it's ever released.

       urlLink    The NYC based band  urlLink The Bravery  have been likened to a Cure tribute band that decided to write their own songs. Sounds cool to me. This song makes me want to put on lots of black eyeliner and pogo around, so I understand the reference. It's been hard finding any info on these guys, but they're playing my old stomping ground  urlLink The Bowery Ballroom  on July 21st, so if you see the show - please give us an update.

       urlLink     Trans Am - TA (Thrill Jockey) 2002 - This album is a two year old entry but I was just recently introduced to them. With me being mainly influenced by electronic at the moment, this band breathes, for me, new life in to the rock/punk genre. With a perfect blend of rock and electronic, they make you put your hands up and bring the house down with a 80's new wave punk sound with a bite! Got the pleasure of seeing them in Chicago a few weeks ago in a local dive. COLDWAR (check link above) represents the albums freedom to touch on 80's but also presents their ability to transform it into the sound of tomorrow... My favorite release on the album is POSITIVE PEOPLE, which they performed at the show. Touch of New Order meets Judias Priest, just insanely wicked! Great show and nothing less than everything I expected. Check out their latest release called Liberation or  urlLink visit them on their offical site!

         urlLink Laika  was the first living creature to exit the Earth's atmosphere...  urlLink the first dog in space , sent up by the Soviets. Laika, the band, exhibits many of the same qualities: experimental, ethereal and kinda "out there." Laika formed in London in 1993. Vocalist Margaret Fiedler left her band,  urlLink Moonshake , to join Guy Fixsen and John Frenett and a mass of others from the  urlLink Too Pure  record label. Another example of a band that can't quite land on any given style...my favorite!  This track is from their 2000 release "Good Looking Blues" - and we can all relate.

       urlLink    A shy lovably geeky pop music obsessive, Ron Fountenberry, aka  urlLink Incredible Moses Leroy  (his great-grandfather's name; the incredible comes from his appreciation of comic book superheroes), constructs the kind of albums any shy lovably geeky pop music obsessive would, if given the chance. A genre-hopping cornucopia of ideas and sounds that spans the dial from '80s-flavored pop, rock, and new wave to '60s easy listening, chamber music, jazz, and breakbeat. This track is pulled from his more or less EP "Growing Up Clean in America"  I am hard pressed to list out bands that I find similar to this modern hip-cat, so listen up and pick your own.

       urlLink     urlLink The Maxwell Implosion  is Torsten Heller, a German DJ who fuses lounge, jazz, bossa nova, and soundtracks of the '60s and '70s. Before recording his own work, the record connoisseur had stints on the turntables in Japan, the United States, Moscow, Barcelona, and Rome. The Maxwell Implosion has played shows with  urlLink Dimitri From Paris , the Brand New Heavies,  urlLink Towa Tei , and the Cardigans, while remix work has included Pizzicato Five and  urlLink Kenickie . His debut record, Small Circle of Friends, features contributions from like-minded artists such as Laila France, Nicola Conte, and Montefiori Cocktail.  The album is a a cute mix of varying styles - 70's R&B, mellow house, Latinioesque dance rythms, with a dash of Trip Hop.

       urlLink    People often ask me, "So, where do you stand in the electroclash debate? Is it the future of music or a tarted-up rehash of old ideas?"  Ok, so no one has really ever asked me that, but if they did - I would say this with certainty: I don't really think much about  urlLink Electroclash  at all. Do you?

They look like this crazy hippie cult that are  urlLink waiting for some spaceship  to come and take them back to heaven. I think every song on their album  urlLink The Beginning Stages of...  has the word "Day" in it. It's totally crazy and alien. And I love that!  See, maybe I'm crazy, but this  urlLink video  makes me want to sell all my possesions, quit my job and follow them on tour. I could sell peanut butter sandwiches in the parking lot for gas money and trade friendship bracelets for cigarettes. Don't tempt me.   urlLink

Poor Perry Farrell isn't having a  urlLink good week . Back in the late '80's in the suburbs of Memphis, my JA and Cure albums were on constant rotation on the ole stereo and although I have outgrown many other bands from that time period, I never get tired of hearing  urlLink Stop . My boyfriend in high school made me a mixed tape with  Classic Girl  as the first song and sealed the deal in getting me to have sex with him. It would probably still work today.    urlLink

The mastermind behind the project, Chris Colonna, hails from down under but fine tuned his beats in Brooklyn while attending Pratt. With a buzz clip on MTV2 and tours with Radiohead and N.E.R.D, they're covering all the bases in terms of becoming the next big thing. They were scheduled to be at Lollapalooza, but because of the cancellation they won't touring until September.   urlLink

       urlLink    Stephin Merritt, who spawned Magnetic Fields, ( urlLink see past post ),is an undoubted musical genius, but, as seems to be so often the case, appears unwilling to commit himself to one pure, identifiable style. The album  "Wasp's Nest"  is an inspired collection of beautifully understated pieces. It's quite different from some of the music that Merritt has produced under his other aliases, but is equally valid.  It is the lyrical content that makes this album stand out, being as it is a combination of astonishingly clever word-play and unbelievably corny love poetry.

       urlLink    The most producer-driven act in the Japanese pop movement known as  urlLink Shibuya-kei ,  urlLink Fantastic Plastic Machine  was formed by ex- urlLink Pizzicato 5  member Tomoyuki Tanaka. Though he has the basic stylistic tastes requisite of the Shibuya-kei artist (namely lounge music, bossa nova, French pop and soft rock), Tanaka has more of a club mentality, driven by his long experience as a DJ.  This track, pulled from the album "Luxury", is infectiously catchy - undoubtably the stand out track from the album that easily outperforms such UK equivalents for the musical talent and sheer diversity on display.   What would we do with out guys like this? Probably not smile as much....   urlLink

       NYC based  urlLink Argentine  (meaning  silver ), has given us the chance to review their music, and I am quite happy that they have. Haunting songs with a post-pop, slow driven and deeply emotional feel. Slumberside pulls you right into it's peaceful yet powerful acoustic dream. The feel of this reminds me of older Radiohead, but it remains in a class of it's own. The ending has quite a surprising 70's-esque twist that catches the listener off guard in a most pleasant way. A groovy thumbs up to these cats!   Thanks for the submission

       urlLink    Remember when  urlLink Dummy  by  urlLink Portishead  came out? It was my first introduction to trip-hop and I fell hard and fast. Since I was a huge  urlLink Tori Amos  fan, but spent a lot of my time in clubs listening to techno and house, it was the perfect blending of two styles that really didn't seem to have much in common. Even with all Portishead's success, the genre seemed to slip back into obscurity. Sure, there was  urlLink The Sneaker Pimps  and  urlLink Poe , and more recently  urlLink Goldfrapp , but none of those artists have had the same success. Maybe  urlLink Daughter Darling  will be the catalyst to re-invigorate the movement. With two former hip-hop producers adding beats to the impressive vocals of Natalie Walker, their dark, moody atmospheric music is hard not to appreciate.

       urlLink    I bought this album at the end of last year when The Stills were on tour with  urlLink Ryan Adams . I wanted to check them out before I saw them play. Then Ryan went and broke his hand and cancelled his tour and this CD ended up lost under the seat of my car. A couple of weeks ago I saw the video for this song and remembered that I had this album, somewhere...  Anyway, I've been listening a lot to  urlLink The Stills  this past week and I really like them. I started reading up on what was going on with them and if I had a dollar for every  Cure ,  Joy Division , or  Echo and the Bunnymen  reference, well, I could afford to buy their next album. It's funny, cause growing up in the 'burbs, listening to those bands with my friends, we thought we were different, separate from the mainstream, original, in on a secret. But I guess everyone was listening to those bands, cause it seems this whole NYC band explosion is being accused of being derivative of that era. Oh, well, I never pay attention to music reviews. They're silly.

All that time I was really missing out on a great record. What a Loser! When I finally came across it in my CD collection, I was thinking about selling it at the used CD store. Thank goodness I stopped to give it a spin first. Pinback are obvious predecessors to bands like The Postal Service, another band I heart. A quick search of the Pinback website shows they've had a bunch of records come out since this one. Doh! Alright, I'm headed straight to the record store to undo my heinous lack of appreciation for such a really great band. Over and out.

       urlLink    I was pumping up the jam with this record the other night before going out for the evening and I made a mental note to share it with you. This is a record that I pull out when the timing is right, it's not a car record, nor a getting-ready-for-work record. Just like anything by  urlLink Daft Punk , this is a record you put on when you're ready to get your party on.  urlLink VHS or Beta  are a four piece from Lousiville that are teaching the indie kids to dance again. So ditch the trucker hat and grab some platforms and your boa, they've got a  urlLink new record  dropping in September and they aim to make that booty shake. They're heading to my old stomping ground the  urlLink Exit Inn  in Nashville on the 20th of August. Anyone wanna go?

       Reaching number 4 on the my 10 top cutest of all time dance tracks is this release from  urlLink Stereo Total , a Berlin based band with more styles of music than I care to count. Everything from garage punk love songs about Yoko Ono to slow countryesque ballads with a twist, to off the wall cuts like this one. Every release is a different little package within itself. Their members consist of people from Italy, Scotland, Bohemia and Germany - might explain their diversity, eh?  This album is a more refined electronica sound than past projects. Leaning on the synths in a way that has me reminiscing about the late 80's, but in such a way that the 60's are on the fore front. In listening to this album it might be hard to pin down the bands origin, using 4 languages to present you with a different approach to pop, one that keeps ya grinnin' all the way to the kitchen to get a tall, cool glass of lemonade - extra sweet. The songs title translated means "we're dancing in the square".  (thanks to an anonymous poster for that)

       Time for that way back hat again. When I first started DJing back in 1988, I picked this up from a music store here in Memphis. Not knowing what a famous  track it would have become, it was and still is one of my favorite older dance cuts to date. A strong driving, nod your head, 101 thick, infectious tune that sticks with ya.   Stakker  produced this one 12" and went on in later years to become the widely know band  urlLink The Future Sound of London  in 1991 - the duo of Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans became an infamous British group, with influences spanning acid house, hardcore, ambient, krautrock, 60's psychedelica, and more - one of the most influential electronic acts of the last 15 years.  Producing music to this day, I tend to prefer their older works, but if you are a fan of anything electronic and haven't given them a listen - do so.   Like this? -  urlLink buy it here

       OK,  urlLink Luke Vibert  has one too many alias - Wagon Christ, Plug, Butler Keiv, Ace of Clubs, Amen Andrews &amp; Kerrier District - but for good reason. As a man that has been known to produce  one track a day for months on end  I guess he felt the need to spread it around a good bit. The album that this rather light hearted track is pulled from ' Stop The Panic', is a collaborative project with legendary pedal-steel guitarist  B.J. Cole .  Ah - cheese. But only the highest quailty of cheese food was made for this album.  "It was hardly even a thought-about project," Luke says. "It was just having a laugh together." Or as BJ puts it, "we sit around getting stoned together - everything flows from there."  But their efforts had produced on of the funnest electronica albums of 2000.

       urlLink    Mark says I like Fashion Rock. Fine. Whatever. Nobody wants to be thought of as a bandwagon rider, but there's buzz for a reason right? Just like a stereotype is based partially in truth, so is hype. When I bought  urlLink Stellastarr 's self-titled  urlLink debut  I really didn't want to like it as much as I do, but then I relized that if I refused to jump on the hipster train because I would be accused of jumping on the hipster train, then the terrorists have won.   So for those of you who have only heard  Jenny  or  Somewhere Across Forever  and have pegged Stellastarr* as just another new waver knock-off, you're missing out on a lot of other great songs on their album, like this one. They're playing  urlLink Summerstage  in Central Park at the end of the month, but of course, if you're in NYC you already knew that.

       urlLink    Have you been following the  urlLink saga of Pete Doherty  and  urlLink The Libertines ? It seems they kicked his heroin-and-crack-addicted-ass out of the band after he ducked out after a three day stay at one of the most hard-core rehabs in the world located in Thailand. He checked into a hotel and had his heroin served to him via room service along with his bacon and eggs. When he ran out of money he got on the internet and asked his fans to wire him funds to get home. While the remaining members of the band have continued to tour this summer, Pete has been doing solo gigs at his flat in london for anyone who might show up to get money to support his drug habit.   The Libertines were supposed to be the biggest thing since sliced bread, beating out  Radiohead  and  Coldplay  for a Best British Band award from NME. But just like  urlLink The Vines , they seemed to have crashed and burned before they could ever make good on the promise of saving rock 'n roll. They have a  urlLink new album  coming out at the end of August, this is the first single.

       urlLink    I came across  urlLink Texas '  urlLink White on Blonde  in the used CD section at Kim's in the East Vilage the first week I moved to NYC. It became my soundtrack for the summer of '99, a full two years after it's release. Hailed as "a critical and commercial masterpiece which topped the British charts for weeks, sold millions of copies, spawned five Top 10 singles, and still ranks high in many charts as one of the best British albums ever," this stunner of an album fell through the cracks in the U.S. Some have speculated this was due to their record label not feeling their evolution from roots based rock songs to synth white soul. If the album had actually been promoted, it probably would have blown up in the States. I've always been surprised that they've never been embraced by American radio, or Americans in general. This is a great album to put on when you invite that special someone over for dinner and maybe a little dessert.

       urlLink    Normally when I hear about an actress seeking out a musical career, I dry heave in disgust from my finger being lodged in the back of my throat. However, I'm looking forward to the release of  urlLink Juliette and the Licks'  new album being released in October, and this may just be a first. Juliette Lewis sounds so dirty and full of sexual energy, she's hard not to take seriously. Lewis has always skated on the edge of celebrity, never falling prey to the usual antics of young Hollywood "it" girls. Her music seems to be as gritty as some of the roles she's had, and with Patty Schemel backing her on drums, comparisons to early  urlLink Hole  won't be totally out of place. She's being touted as the best thing on the  urlLink Van's Warped Tour , shaking and sweating in a bikini top and crowd surfing.  Juliette and the Licks  may be a vanity project but I think we'll let her slip by as the real thing.

       urlLink    The six-man Berlin-based DJ/producer team Jazzanova helped define 21st Century electronic soul through its 2002 full-length "In Between" and the essential collection "Remixes, 1997-2000." However, to grasp the full breadth of the Jazzanova esthetic -- everything from U.S. hip-hop to Japanese nu-jazz to UK broken beat -- one needs to hear the guys' transcendent DJ sets. Now they've made it easy: no need to jet around the globe or dig through the Internet for a Jazzanova mixtape when you can pick up the new "... Mixing" on Jazzanova's own  urlLink Sonar Kollektiv  label. This is no "Global Underground" marathon of generic "boom-boom-boom-boom" dance music; this is unabashed creativity behind the decks, showcasing serious mixing skills, curatorial consistency and a host of talent from the Sonar Kollektiv family.  Start with the unreleased DJ Jazzy Jeff version of Jill Scott's "A Long Walk," progress through a bubbling set of boogie-esque house (including a Jazzanova cover of Patrice Rushen's "Let Your Heart Be Free"), throw in a couple of new remixes of cuts from "In Between," and end on a haunting downtempo note with Philly hip-hop queen Bahamadia and Norwegian jazzers Bugge Wesseltoft and Sidsel Endresen. Throw this mix on at your next party and freak out in style.

       urlLink    Well, I hesitated to post this, but since it's out there and  urlLink From A Basement On The Hill  has made it to amazon, might as well. The first time I listened to this track, I felt a shiver straight up my spine, and as I write this I regret that I didn't take the opportunity to visit with  urlLink Elliott Smith  more often. His untimely death is still under scrutiny by his most hard-core fans and we'll probably never know what really happened, but I can predict that in 20 years as the  Cult of Elliott  grows, a film will be produced to inflate the legend. I'm sure the irony of this song is not lost on too many, but like the pink elephant in the living room, let's not pretend that we don't see it.

       Put on the way back hat, set it for 1989, go to any record store (ya know, the ones that still commonly sold LP's?), and pick up  urlLink A Guy Called Gerald's  "Automanikk". One of the founding fore fathers of Acid, Chicago and Detroit house - Gerald Simpson deserves all the credit he is due. The track  Voodoo Ray  became a launching point for him, making his name common amongst dance floors and strongly influencing the genre. I feel this song can hold it's own and has survived the test of time. I have always wanted to have a DJ toss this into his set of current cuts and see how the crowd takes it.  He teamed up with a few chaps in 1988 to form  urlLink 808 State  and has lent his hand to the artist  urlLink Finley Quaye . Still producing today, his offerings float around Drum-n-Bass. You may now return to your regularly scheduled beer.

       The most recent release by Luke Vibert (aka Wagon Christ & Plug) under the moniker "Kerrier District" takes its inspiration from disco's final moments. Disco became electric circa 1980, and scores of early electronic dance producers pumped out records so underground that they are just now being unearthed at garage sales. Many of them are finding the light of day just when they need to, as they were quite ahead of their time. It was one such record, Black Devil's " urlLink Disco Club " (actually found at a garage sale in New Jersey by one of the Rephlex guys and recently reissued) that lit a disco fireball under Vibert. He heard the record and locked himself in the proverbial closet. Stagnant no more (just listen to his previous Wagon Christ release), Vibert emerged with his best work ever: a disco meltdown in the vein of  urlLink Metro Area  but solidly Luke Vibert. "Let's dance and Freak" is my favorite track of the moment.

       urlLink    The latest  urlLink Innocence Mission  album is being hailed as their best work since they began making albums over 15 years ago. I have to admit Karen Peris' voice sounds just as saccarine sweet as ever, not that there's anything wrong with that. I remember listening to them in high school along with their counterparts,  urlLink 10,000 Maniacs  (Natalie Merchant version, natch) and  urlLink The Sundays . Of course, this was back when I still wore kulats and knee socks, read Salinger and kissed boys under the bleachers. Or was that last week?

       urlLink    So, in my continual pursuit of making this blog a "college rock" dumping ground (as I have been accused of lately) and in celebration of the release of the new album  urlLink Shine A Light , I present to you a track off this Canadian band's debut which has recently been reissued. I swear I am not a shill for Sub Pop, I am just really digging the stuff that they are putting out right now.    urlLink The Constantines  have been compared to an early version of  urlLink Fugazi , which isn't anything to be ashamed of. Most D.C. influenced bands would give up their liprings to be compared to the likes to Picciotto and MacKaye. They might implore that they want "the death of rock 'n roll" but they seem to have been doing their homework.

       Once again, The Hives have come from Sweden to save rock-and-roll. They seem to do that every couple of years, and for that I am grateful.   The Hives became one of the most trendy bands of the early 2000's as the garage-rock sound exploded nationwide. It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen. Two-piece, beer-guzzling R&amp;B trashbands from detroit and svelte, Eastern-Europeans that would be mistaken for The Stooges if they were less produced by one iota began to dominate popular radio. It would have been heaven for the indie-rock kids if they were allowed to listen to records that sell more than 10,000 copies. At least it was a fitting pendulum swing from the decade I regard to be the worst in rock-and-roll history: the 90s (Nirvana ruined everything, but that's another rant). The Hives have been the standout in the garage revival. The three albums they've released over their eleven-year history are all classic material, proving that the Hives are more than just a flash in the pan riding on a fad. In fact, they may just be the most "rock-and-roll" rock-and-roll band in the world right now. They are certainly more rock-and-roll than you... ;)   At any rate, I had a very difficult time choosing just one song from the new Hives record, Tyrannosaurus Hives. The whole album is fabulous. Every track is worth a post. I finally chose "Love in Plaster" because it strokes my love of new-wave. Go out and buy Tyrannosaurus Hives. You'll be glad you did.

       Mr Felix has been around for a good long while, making his mark across many electronic musical venues and working with more artisits than I care to count. This track in particular from Kitten & Thee Glitz" (2001) is a more hard driving tune that blends a style or two to create a serious groove.   Short and sweet cuz I need a nap

        urlLink Lowfish  is the work of Toronto producer Gregory De Rocher, who runs Suction Records with his longtime friend Jason Amm of Solvent. The pair share an appreciation for New Wave and early industrial artists like  urlLink Skinny Puppy  and  urlLink Front 242 , as well as a studio where distorted 808 drum beats and bouncy, melodic analog synth lines are the sounds of choice. Their tunes tend to be classified as "Lo-Fi". Despite their obsessive-compulsive fixation on cleanliness and complexity, they retain a groovy dance floor energy, making Lowfish a brand of intelligent machine music sure to stimulate all parts of your cerebral cortex.

       urlLink    Speaking of  urlLink Olivia Tremor Control  ( urlLink remember this post ?), check out a new song from  urlLink The Sunshine Fix , the latest project from Bill Doss, one of the founding members of Elephant Six pioneers OTC. Bill also wrote  Friends Win  from the  urlLink Power Puff Girls: Heroes And Villains Soundtrack , so you know what that means...he probably really likes kids!  In all seriousness, this track is off their second full length album  urlLink Green Imagnation  released just a few days ago. I'd file it under the evergrowing group of '60's influenced pop along the lines of  urlLink The Polyphonic Spree . This song is tempting me to break out some old school  urlLink Jellyfish . Now that's a reunion I'd pay to see.

       urlLink     urlLink Beulah 's 3rd record, the quirky  urlLink The Coast Is Never Clear , is filled with some of the best song title's I've ever come across:  What Will You Do When Your Suntan Fades?,    A Good Man Is Easy To Kill , and  Night Is The Day Turned Inside Out  are classic indie pop with twangy melodies and spirited lyrics of a guy who's not too cool to care. Although I'd love to give you a smart and witty review of the album as a whole, Miles Kurosky already explained it perfectly:   "With (this) record, I knew I didn't want to make the same one twice. There's a bossa nova song, a country song, a soul song, an ambient one, an Asian thing, a song that almost sounds like Macha -- it all sounds like Beulah to me. We're influenced as much by Stereolab as the Beatles and Beach Boys. . . . This record was more influenced by going out on the road with Wilco and loving Summer Teeth than it was a lot of other records."     Popular Mechanics for Lovers  is my favorite song off this classic album.    BREAKING NEWS:  Beulah played their last show at Castle Clinton today in NYC. Damnit!

       Don't ya love/hate it when you find out the labeling of a particular type of music you have been grooving on? The classification in question -   Brazilectro  . I don't think I need to explain just what area of music this covers.This track by Mr Aaron, who I had a helluva time finding anything on other than other tracks he has done, was a contribution to a collection for this styles name-sake,  urlLink Brazilectro 4 . I believe this seris is now up to  5  volumes. If ya dig everything from soulful, jazz tinged, electonically flirtacious, brazilian and latin tunes, this collection is a must. Each release is 2 CDs of worthy, diverse music.  Spice it up!

       From their North London studio, Dan Tyler and Conrad McDonnell (aka the Idjut Boys) run  three  record labels and produce their infectious dub-heavy disco sampling house for many more.  The U-Star Daze  (2000) is with out a doubt a house connoisseurs’s delight, in the purist form. An entire collection of Idjut Boy material procured from the hard to find U-Star label. The album's closing track,  Whoktish , takes house to an entirley different level. Heavy on the organic side, it wraps you in a cozy, warm, laid out blanket of groove. One of my all time favorite dance floor cuts.

       This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite songs of all time. In 2002, electro-disco experienced a revival/revision that isn't really losing steam at all. In fact, it seems to be escalating in stature and sophistication while the tempo just keeps slowing down.  urlLink Legowelt  is among electro's most interesting and innovative producers. Nearly all his singles are classics in some sense, and "2002" is probably the best example. "2002" is high-energy dancefloor magic that seethes with intelligence in its homage to producers of a decade (the 80s, of course) that never really figured out how to use its equipment.

       Here's more shameless promotion of Memphis Music. Viva L'American Deathray Music has been my favorite local band for about five years. They've changed a lot, and they rarely play locally anymore (the latest in a succession of drummers lives in Austin, TX). In fact, "New Commotion" isn't even very representative of them any longer, and I must admit that they're current sound (inspired heavily by no-wave) is my favorite (there are no recordings that demonstrate it, to my knowledge).  Here's a three-chord, garage-rock burner with heavy notes of new-wave. It's a great song, so I will try not to ruin it with my pretensions.

       urlLink    Turn down the lights, grab your headphones and fire up a doobie, cause you're in for quite a ride.  urlLink The Earlies  mix quintessential psychedelia with electronic bleeps and blips without forgetting to add a dash of lo-fi to cascade over your ears in a mesmerizing flush of sound. Although often compared to  urlLink The Flaming Lips , I sort of hear more of an  urlLink Olivia Tremor Control  influence. Although, with half of the band hailing from Texas and the other half from Manchester, it would probably be pretty hard to pinpoint a single inspiration.

       urlLink    Sounding like an outtake from  urlLink Little Earthquakes ,  urlLink Charlotte Martin 's  Something Like A Hero  wears it's influences on it's sleeve. If you are unfamiliar with the bio of  urlLink Tori Amos , the other comparisons will mean nothing to you, but if you are a fan, they're almost creepy. The classically trained Charlotte "uses her shows to further connect with her fans, keeping the evening conversational." She's also really into  urlLink comics , which is reminiscent of Amos' connection with  urlLink Neil Gaiman . One of her bios claims, "Martin's approach encompasses the orchestrated ruminations of Kate Bush, the poetic storytelling of Joni Mitchell, and the melancholy melodies of The Cure" which could have been copied straight from Tori's own bio. Spooky.

       urlLink    The new album from  urlLink Bjork ,  urlLink Medulla , isn't due to hit stores until the end of August, but because of the magic of the internet, we don't have to wait until then to at least get a little taste. Bjork, in her signature quirky style, has declared, "Instruments are so over." This album is all straight up a cappella.   Does anyone else remember the  urlLink video  that was an animation of Bjork having sex with her boyfriend? The intro to this song sounds like the outtake soundtrack.  P.S. Thanks  urlLink Stereogum !

        mmmm... vocoder. Even after almost fifteen years of electronic music and an even further reaching fascination with the chunk of analog plastic, I am still taken by it. Mitgang Audio's remix of Solvent's "My Radio" is chock-full to the gills with vocoder. It is electro-pop that doesn't let up.  Solvent ( Jason Amm ) has always been an artist I feel like I should love, but he usually leaves me wondering, wishing for more. I definately appreciate his feel for the analog and his talent for manipulating electronic antiquities (hardly an appropriate term when one is not speaking to hipsters who came of age in the 80's), but I have a hard time listening to his music. I think it focuses too much upon itself - much like the earliest electronic "Moog" music of Hot Butter or Perrey-Kingsley. It becomes more than a little bit boring for it's oversimplicity of composition and lack of passion after the novelty wears off. But the remixes are another story entirely. Third parties tend to give Solvent's skeletal pieces what they are missing. Mitgang Audio - a completely unasheamed electro-pop outfit - worked wonders for "My Radio." Check out the rest of Radio Ga Ga Parts 1 &amp; 2 (both remix EPs) if like good electro-pop or you feel like I do about Solvent.

      Two major changes going down here at  Scenestars . The first is that we will only be hosting mp3's for 7 days. The second is that the three main contributors have consolidated their picks into their own radio blogs. As our other contributors get on the ball and post more songs, they will get radio blogs too. Since we all tend to be into different stuff, this makes the music flow a little better.   The good news is that even though we won't have unlimited hosting for the songs, you can always click on the contributor's radio blog and hear the song. Technology rocks.  Comments, Questions, Feedback?  Ok, then. Carry On.

       I have this habit of putting my mp3 player to play my  entire  library at random. Every once in a while I run across a keen little ditty or two that I had almost forgotten. This is one of the many tracks I have collected over the past few years - one of those stand-alone, one hit wonders (usually because the rest of the artists tracks are rather insipid). I looked into DJ Rodriguez online and could not pin down just which DJ Rodriguez this is. At any rate, this is one of the funnest, hipest, electro-lounge bits to ever bless the dance floor that I have yet to be on when it was played.  Savor the flavour...hip on in and swing for a spell.

       I first encountered Erlend Øye as the vocalist on  Röyksopp 's pop masterpiece, "Remind Me." I loved the song (still do), but it gave me little indication of just how amazing Øye is.  Erlend's first LP, "Unrest," features ten tracks cut in ten different cities with ten different collaborators. They are not just any collaborators. The record features the likes of Scneider TM, Soviet, Mr. Velcro Fastner, and Prefuse 73. "Ghost Trains" features Morgan Geist (my dreamy fave) and it is, again, perfect dance-pop. Those Noweigans!

       I was not a fan of the Beta Band's first two albums. They have always been giant critical darlings, favorites of the record geeks (well, all except me it seems), but I just never got it... until now. The new Beta Band LP, "Heroes to Zeros" marries that rave-up, early-90's "Manchester sound" (ala Charlatans UK and Happy Mondays) with Pink Floyd in a way that I understand. Perhaps I am just beginning to become old and uncool, and Beta Band makes me nostalgic (don't think so). At any rate, I love "Assessment." It has just enough&nbsp;Scottish (Beta Band&nbsp;is from Edinburgh)&nbsp;alocoholic desperation to make the bippity-boppity psychedelic-swing great.   I just woke up. Well, I am waking up. It only takes an hour and a half. I am still having coffee anyway. The point is that I shouldn't write in the morning. I sound like such a prick... would you read that stuff up there... Just listen to the Beta Band and ignore the hell out of me.&nbsp;   BREAKING NEWS:   urlLink Beta Band breaks up!

       urlLink    Everybody's got a side project these days.  urlLink The Elected  is Blake Sennett's of  urlLink Rilo Kiley . Sounding like a cross between  urlLink Conor Oberst  and  urlLink Elliott Smith  and links from their site for  urlLink Team Love  and liner notes thanking Smith, this probably isn't much of a coincidence. Jenny Lewis, Sennett's cohort in Rilo Kiley and Jimmy Tamborello of The Postal Service (I'm not obsessed, really!), collaborate on a few songs, so the gang's all here. urlLink    urlLink Sub Pop  seems to be having their best year since  urlLink Bleach  was released.

       OK, I can't help it. If ever there was an electronic artist I near   worshipped   over all others, it would have to be Amon. Hence another track. This one is pulled from my favorite project of his to date, "Permutation". The word meaning  'A group of elements from a set in which the order of the elements is important.'  Amon has that approach with this album more so than in others.  Toys  shows a more playful yet sinister side of Amon, and one that I find quite agreeable. Tidy some?     >: }

       urlLink    Speaking of SDRE, three of the original members have reunited to form  urlLink The Fire Theft . I understand why they did not keep their original moniker, as this new incarnation of the band veers considerably from where the original group left off, with a more almost  urlLink classic rock  feel. It took me quite a few listens to the first  urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate  album to get into it, so maybe I need to give it a few more listens before making a final judgement.

       urlLink     urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate  - godfather's of emo before Jeremy Enigk found god and Nate Mendel and William Goldsmith found the  urlLink Foo Fighters .     Lately, I've come across a new deluge of anti-emo  urlLink communities . I thought that backlash happened 3 years ago, but apparently the inundation of recent label signings of bands like  urlLink Yellowcard ,  urlLink Story of the Year  and  urlLink Switchfoot  have old schoolers crying foul. The funny thing is, old school emo wasn't called emo, it was called  urlLink Weezer  - before they went all  urlLink Sabbath , of course. And don't email me to say it was actually  urlLink Fugazi  or  urlLink Minor Threat  that was the original emo, all true hipsters know that it was Kermit the Frog's "It's Not Easy Being Green."
