      My mind goes blank sometimes as I sit and day dream about days gone by. I find it hard to believe I am now fourty eight years old and still living in the very same home I grew up in. My father is 76 years old and lives on the first floor with my oldest daughter who is now 22. My mother past away ten years ago. I honestly believe it was the hardest thing I ever had to go through in my life.   Growing up I wasn't very close to my mother. As a matter of fact we bucked heads a lot but as I grew older and had children of my own we became the best of friends. As a matter of fact there wasn't a day, in the last twelve years of her life, that my mother and I didn't have lunch together. I worked at home while I raised my family and my mother worked the 3 to midnight shift. It wasn't an easy shift for her but she did it all the same. She went to work to make a better life for our family when I was about ten years old. She stopped working about five years before her death. I still miss her every day. Now when I think of her I remember how wonderful it was getting to know her as an adult. I see the hard times she had to endure and I understand all she went through in her young life, her marriage and in bringing us up right.   I was married to my first husband for eleven years and I have to admit they were tough years. We had three children by the time we split up just six months after my mothers death. I knew it was coming for a long time. My only regret is it didn't happen till after her death. She worried about me everyday. That's why I think she made sure she saw me every day. She was afraid if she didn't something would happen to me. I honestly believe my mother was more than aware of the abuse and negelect I put up with every day of my life. My husband didn't know how to be a husband. He had no role model to go by since his father wasn't that great a husband either. People used to get so frustrated with me because I always went to his defense but I believed I was his wife and that is what a wife does. Unfortunately he didn't feel that was what a husband should do so he went about his business and enjoyed himself on a daily basis.   I think he thought I was oblivious of his extra activities but he was dead wrong. As a matter of fact the person who opened my eyes to his games was my mother. She found out he was cheating on me and instead of ignoring it she called me, had me over in the evening for coffee, and let me know what she knew. The rest of my family was there for support but they only screamed at me when I said I wasn't leaving him. My mother just stood there and looked me in the eye as if to say I understand. She told them they couldn't expect me to just walk out. She knew I how I believed in my marriage vows. I tried for years to keep it together and she stood behind me and supported me every way she could. I know she hated seeing the saddness in my eyes and she prayed everyday I would be free of him but ultimately it was my decission to leave or to stay.  I guess when my mother died I no longer had my best friend to go to who would make me feel better. I sat in my house night after night remembering her love and warmth. Anger grew inside of me because my husband was not home. The person who should have been helping me through the toughest time of my life was with someone esle and would return home as if nothing was wrong. One night, as I sat in my room alone again, I talked out loud to my mother as if she were there. I asked her to help me get the courage up to do what I knew needed to be done. I admit I cried for the loss of my mother and for my marriage but at no time did I cry for the loss of my husband, at least not the man I was now married to, the man he had become. Some how over the years he changed and became his father, cold, uncaring, and mean. I longed for the man I married but I knew he was lost forever. As I spoke to her I could almost feel her arms go around me as warmth encircled me. I knew then that she would always be with me and hear me as I speak to her. Even in death she gave me the courage to go on and not to let him destroy my life.   My mother was my best friend. She was always there for me. Even now I can feel her presence and her strength. I don't think I have ever met anyone stronger then she. She died, at the young age of 59, from lung cancer. Her fight lasted eight long months and I often think about the pain she endured. Even with all she was going through she worried about the well being of me and my three children. She made my father promise he would be there if we needed him and he was and still is.   Her support and love over the years gave me the courage to find myself and explore what I like about myself. That was some thing my ex husband was able to tear apart over the years. She encouraged me to go for a job as a pre school teacher which I did and I loved. I taught for five years before I had a car accident on, what would have been my mothers birthday had she lived, March 4, 1998. Since then I have not taught pre school but I have gone back to writing. I think my mother was the only one I ever showed my work to. She always encouraged me to move on it and believed one day I would get a book published if I just believed in myself. Now I have a wonderful husband who believes in me the same way she did and encourages me to work on getting my novel published. Over the past three years my children have started to read my work as well. I think next to my husband of four years, they are my biggest supporters.   If my mother was here with me today she would be my best friend and supporter. She would push me to do what was best for me and to take care of myself so I would be around for a long time. Whenever I feel scared or sad I think about her and I feel her presence all around me. I know she is watching out for us for I truely believe she is my guardian angel.   Just the day before my mother died I was in her hospital room with her enjoying an old Fred Astaire move. Mom was in a coma but I sat next to her bed and held her hand, talking softly to her about the movie. I talked and believed she listened because I asked her if she liked the music and would like to get up and go dancing. My mothers feet started to move as if she was dancing and I could feel her squeeze my hand. The nurse came in to give her medication and I told her what happened but she insisted it had something to do with her pain medication. I knew better. Before the nurse left the room my mother opened her eyes and pulled off her oxygen mask asking for Toni. The nurse asked me if I was Toni and of courses I said I was. I moved closer to the bed and tried to put her oxygen mask back on her but she fought me. She had to talk to me. Her eyes wide she took hold of my hands and looked me in the eyes to tell me she loved me. Those were the last words my mother, my best friend, ever said to me. She closed her eyes that day for the last time.   The next day she died at 6:30 pm just two days after Thanksgiving. I am so glad, thankful, I got to hear her tell me she loved me but more importantly I am thankful I got to tell her I loved her.

      Someone once told me I looked rediculous always smiling and I couldn't understand why it bothered them so much. Recently I have gone through some hard times in my life and my mind didn't know how to sort it all out. It bothered me and still bothers me to this day how my being happy annoyed so many people. What's even more amazing is now that I have gone through some tough times, not that I hadn't before but these times were the icing on the cake, these same people are happy to see me on the down side. It's as though I joined their club. I can't and won't have that. It's not for me to look forward to a life of sadness because it makes other people happy. I have to be me and inside myself I am still smiling just having a hard time bringing to the outside. I have made a decission to try and bring that out as much as possible. It's not that I want to upset those around me by smiling and being happy it's that I want to make myself whole again.   I was divorced from my first husband of twelve years almost nine years ago. He remarried within eight months of our divorce to one of the women he had an affair with over our twelve years of marriage. My marriage wasn't all that great obviously but I loved him with all my heart and did from the day I met him ten years before we married. All together, before we divorced, we were together twenty two years. You think you would know a person. Like they say you don't till you live with them. My first husband was self centered after we married and who knows maybe he was before but I loved him so much I didn't see it. Then we had children. Our first was born within  the first year of our marriage. You would think things could only get better from there but then you would be thinking wrong but that is what marriage is all about, ups and downs. You are a couple and you work through them together but my husband didn't like the weight gain with each child and he didn't understand a tired wife who was up all night and day with a sick child. He understood his wants and needs and they were to come first above all else. In his eyes I ruined his life and he let me know it every day of our life together even after we split up. It's only recently he has started to talk to me like I am human but that is only after he tore me down completely.  Over the past few years he has tried to get my youngest son to move in with him and no matter what he blamed me for every thing that went wrong in his life. My son kept telling me his father was lonely because he didn't have any of them living with him and he isn't happy with is second wife. When I remarried he tried to get all three of our children to move out because he didn't like my husband and tried all he could to ruin our life together. The two boys had no problem with my husband but my daughter, who is the oldest, still has a problem with him or the fact that I married him. He has never done anything to her except try to be there if she needed help but she can't stand him acting out or getting upset over anything so he is one that needs to put a smile on whenever she is around. Horrible way to live I say. One day she will realize he is the way he is because of who he is and he cares the way he cares for the same reason. He doesn't have to be here and he doesn't have to help them but he does because he wants to not has to. Anyway back to my ex, he worked hard to get my youngest son to move in with him this past summer. He actually bought him everything he could possibly want for his room and gave him the room of his dreams, upstairs attic away from everyone. Perfect for the teen who wants to be left alone. He didn't, however, give him a family life. From day one my son has called me he's hungry, there's no food in the house because they don't food shop because she doesn't cook. The only time he gets a home cooked meal other than from me is if his father stays home and cooks. His fathers hours are off the wall and varry from day to day so it's hard to say when he will be home. It was hard for my son, at first, to stay alone in the house because his father was out at work and his step mom wasn't home. Now that he's getting older it's getting easier for him to live there but they still forget he's only 16 and think nothing of going to Atlantic City for the night and leaving him home alone. He usually comes and stays in his room here with me on those nights. I hope they do that a lot in the future. Since my son moved in with him my ex has stopped giving me child support even though my other two are still in college and need his help. He pays for nothing as far as their school is concerened and thinks the little he is doing for our son now makes up for the years I took care of them on my own. He tells me the money he gives me for the other two is now going on the care of the one. I can believe that because he only gave me a hundred dollars a week for the three all together and we all know what it costs to support children these days. The thing is I didn't take care of one child I took care of three and I didn't pick one over the other all of my children were the same. They still are. When my son moved in with him I was devistated but I understand how he felt. What was horrible was my ex husband waited for the right time to do this. When I wasn't looking.  In July my father had a heart attack. I was terrified for him. He was 75 years old with a busy life style. I got the call from a freind of his that she had driven him to the hospital. When she called he was already in surgery having a procedure done to fix things. When I got to the hospital my family was there waiting. Over the next few days we went back and forth to the hospital to see my father. On this particular Saturday I went to see my father, it was the day after his attack, when I came home I asked where my youngest son was. My children informed me he moved in with his father. Seems he thought it was time he had his son with him so he could help him improve his baseball skills for school in the fall. I have to admit this was the straw that broke the camels back. I fell apart and for the next two weeks I was lost inside myself and no one understood.   Everyone thought that because he only moved a town over I shouldn't be upset because I could see him any time I wanted to and I could take him to and from school whenever he needed me to. Unless you are a parent you can't possibly understand the pain I felt but I do understand it was nothing against me. My oldest son said it best when he told him it was something my son needed, something he wished he had but his father never gave him the chance. A boy needs more than what a mother can give him and my son needed to have all the help he could in baseball since this is his dream in life. I did feel however, that this was another way for my ex husband to strick out against me and cause me pain when he thought I had suddenly found the perfect life. I had remarried and was happier than anyone could have imagined me to be even with the problems of joining my children to a stepfather. I told them to look at him not as a step father but as a freind that will always be there for them no matter what and he is. No matter how hard it is at times he is there for this entire family and he was there for me through this tough time in my life. I think the thing I enjoy so much now is the seeing the realization of parenthood hit my ex husband every now and then. Once a while he shows he does know how to be a father but he used to know how to be a husband every now and then too. It's too bad he doesn't know how to maintain it. Raising a teenage boy is more than he thought it was going to be and now he is about to find out it's harder when you aren't around. His hours have changed at work and he won't be there in the evening which means my son is once again going to be without dinner and without company in the evening hours. Good thing I'm not that far away.  These are the two things that broke me and took away my smile for what has seemed to be forever. Oh there was a lot more that lead up to this but why bore you with all the details. Every one has hard times in life but it all depends on how you handle them. In the past I would laugh it off and move on but for some reason I wasn't able to do that. Maybe it's the realization my father isn't invinsible but what ever it is I can't let it ruin the rest of my life. I have to pull myself up by the bootstraps so to speak and move on. I have to smile not only inside myself but outside as well for all to see. I think what made me see it that way is the news I recently got from my doctor. I resently had an MRI done of my cervical spine and have been told I need a spinal specialist if I intend to remain walking. You know I intend to do just that and more. I also intend to do it with a smile on my face and a possitive thought in my head. I know it's not going to be easy because when I feel the pain I feel I am reminded things aren't perfect in this not so great body but pushing on is the only way to go. I'm not so sure I want a doctor poking at me but I do know I want to be here with a smile on my face, in my heart, and laughter in my eyes for my grandchildren to see one day so I can share in the joys of their lives. My husband tells me he wants the real me back I am trying hard to give him just that. I know he understands all I have been through since he has been there as well for the past four years but he doesn't know about the recording that plays over and over again in my head of my life and how hard it is for me to push it away now for some reason. I have to push it away if I intend not to let things from the past get me down and take away my life, my light, my smile. My mother used to tell me my smile would light up a room. I think it's time to turn the lights back on and move forward. I think it's time to write and be myself and show my happieness in my words, my heart, my eyes which are the mirror of my soul. Happier days are coming and happier writings are inevitable. Smiles to all and may your most precious dreams come true.

      It feels so good to be in front of this computer and writing this morning. It's been so long since I've been able to post anything. I've been running around lately like a chicken without a head. My husband wants me to slow down but it's going to be a while before I can do that. My day starts out about 6:30 A.M. when I make my husbands lunch, for him to take to work. I hate sending him off to work with out it because he drives a truck, locally, and it's hard for him to stop and pick something up. These past couple of weeks he has to bring me to my friends house to pick up her car in the morning so I can drive her children to school for her. I usually have my own car but my sons been using it since his broke down and he needs one to get back and forth to school and work. At the moment I am also taking my daughter to and from school, she attends Kean University, plus to her internship and her two jobs. We are looking at cars for her as I write this. Hopefully she will be set in a couple of weeks.  In Septemeber my friend, Iris, who had moved to Rhode Island a couple of years ago, moved back to New Jersey only a couple of blocks from my house. It was hard for her since she was seperated from her husband and has two small children ages 10 and 8. Iris is an Amtrak police officer who is on the night shift plus she is in the National Guard. At the time she returned to New Jesery she was working Homeland Security so her hours were extremely hectic and she needed someone to take care of the little ones in the morning. At first she was working the morning shift with the National Guard so there was no one home with them in the morning because their oldest sister, who is eighteen, had to leave earlier then they did for school. I was more then happy to pick them up for school in the morning and take them home after.   It wasn't long after school started her hours increased because she went back to working with Amtrak nights on top of her duties with the National Guard. Unfortunately within a month her duties with Homeland Security increased since they were now on a twelve hour day due to high alert. By the end of September she was one busy woman and I only got to see her on her days off.   This is where the story really begins. In October I went to visit Iris and her family on her day off. When I got there her husband was there visiting with the family as well. They had been working on talking this through and he was spending some time with the children. While I was there he asked me to talk to her about going to the doctor. Seems she found a lump in her breast but missed her appointment because she forgot. Her schedule was getting the best of her but she needed to make time for herself to get it checked out. I promised her I would go with her if she rescheduled the appointment. Before going to the doctor with her she and I had a long talk. She was concerned about her children in case she got called to go to Iraq. My husband and I went to see her on family day with the National Guard and before we left we talked to her about allowing us to take care of the children in case she was deployed. Although she and her husband were talking and he was visiting the children she didn't want him to take them because she was concerned he wouldn't be there for them. He would for a time but then he would do what he always does and start thinking about himself and they needed more than that. Since my husband is a Retired Chief Petty Officer of twenty years and served in Operation Desert Storm he understood her concerns more than I ever could. I met my second husband after he retired. We will be married four years this July 16th. Iris was so happy we approached her about this. I think we eased her fears somewhat.  The following week I went with her to the doctors office for her exam. I knew there was something there since I finally got her to tell me on the way to the office what she found. Her breast had a lump that was visible to her because it was causing a deformity to her breast. It was becoming inverted. I didn't tell her how scared I was but promised her no matter what I would be there for her. When she left the doctors office she knew no more than when she went in except they wanted a momography and if they saw anything questionable they wanted an ultrasound. To my frustration it took nearly a week for her to get scheduled for the test at the hospital and two weeks to get the results from the doctor. By the time we went to the doctors office it was already close to the end of Novemeber but he knew no more than when we first started out. He told her the results of the test showed nothing but he wasn't a breast specialist and wanted her to go to one he recommended. He also told her he didn't think she had anything to worry about that whatever was there wasn't cancer. Of course she asked him how he knew that since he never took a biopsy but he didn't give her an answer to that one. Of course by this time the hours of her jobs were getting to her and she had to leave Homeland Security in order to keep her regular job with Amtrak.  When Iris called the specialist she had to wait almost two weeks for an appointment. I was so frustrated I told her to call and do some yelling to get in there faster but she didn't want to upset the office staff afraid if she needed them for anything they wouldn't help her because she was hard to deal with. I guess I understood what she was saying but I also knew she had to be seen because she was getting worse and the longer she went with out treatment, reguardless of what her GYN had said, the harder this was going to be. Her breast specialist knew the moment she saw Iris what she was looking at wasn't good and did a biopsy in the office. She was putting a rush on it since she was going away for Christmas the following week and didn't want Iris to go to long before she heard anything. Iris got a call from the doctor on Christmas Eve that she had breast cancer, Merry Christmas. Unfortunately this message was left on her machine since the doctor wanted to let her know before she went away for the holidays but she said she would be calling her back to discuss things with her during her vacation and she did. However, it never seemed to fail they were playing phone tag for almost a week. By the time Iris got in to see her it was after New Years. Look at the time frame here. Iris found her lump sometime in September, got to the doctor in November, was told nothing was found but needed to see a speicalist, doesn't get in there till December and then has to wait till January to get things rolling in the right direction. We're talking almost five months, not a good thing in this situation.   The day we went to see the onocologist Iris' husband joined us. He had promised he would be there for support however, it didn't stay that way and evenutally during the time of her treatment she had to break ties with him so she could concentrate on healing herself and not worrying about her relationship with him and how he was letting the kids down. She needed to be well and that's what she needed to think about. The onocologist told us since the lymphnodes were not tested yet that she could only guess what stage Iris was in and that is going under the assumption it hadn't reached the nodes yet. Her assumption was stage 3A but if the nodes were effected it would of course as much as 3B possibly 4, the final stage. I told her we weren't going to think of that but we were going to concentrate on getting her well the stage didn't matter. Of course I told her it was easy for me to say since I wasn't the one going through this but I wouldn't leave her no matter what. Iris was 39 years old at the time she turned 40 only a couple of weeks ago. Her battle is still going on.   Before the end of her second chemo treatment Iris recieved a letter from the hospital that did the momography and ultrasound telling her the test was clear. Boy were they way off. After her first two months of chemo they were happy to say they could operate and remove the breast, start reconstructive procedures, and resume chemo two weeks after surgery. However, things didn't go as planed. Iris did have the breast removed and they did start the reconstruction but the chemo is at a halt because she has an infection in the sight. She needs rest and I do whatever I can do for her and the children. Before she had the surgery she was alone. Her mom lives in Rhode Island so Iris went through chemo with me close by her side and a few freinds from work pitching in whenever they could. After her treatments she was sick for days but when she wasn't we spent all of our time together shopping, starting a business together, and having dinner together every night. I was taking care of two families but I didn't mind because she needed to have her friends around her and she needed to know no matter what her children will have us. She and I talked on a number of occassions, during the first few weeks of her treatment, about what would happen with the little ones. At first things were going ok with her husband and she thought it would be a good thing to have him there for them if anything happened to her but she wanted me and my husband to handle their inheritance because she was afraid their father would squander it leaving them with nothing for college. I agreed but by Valentines Day he returned to his old ways and disappeared for almost two weeks before calling her to see the kids and see how she was doing. Now she refuses to let him in because she can't take the constant let down. She told him it was now going to be about her and her getting well and he was going to have to take care of himself. Iris didn't have one fight to conquer she had two. The one with her husband she had put to rest so she could battle her cancer.   Two weeks after she had her surgery Iris went back to the onocolgist to find out she had an infection in the sight and there were eleven lymphnodes that were touched with cancer. I felt horrible because this was the one day I wasn't able to go with her to the doctors although her mother was with her and had been since the surgery. She told me for the first time she cried. Of course I couldn't let her start feeling sorry for herself, not now. I told her we were going to see the breast specialist about the infection and find out about the lymphnodes but she was not going to let this get her down. When we went to see the speicalist she told us the reason Iris didn't know about the lymphnodes on the day of surgery was because it was not visible to the naked eye and she needed to send them out to the lab. The report had just come back that 11 out of 22 were infact with cancer but a small amount which told her the chemo was doing it's job and we needed not to worry but concentrate on that. I told Iris I would be there for her no matter what and we were going to beat this thing. She also went to see the plastic surgeon who told her he didn't feel the sight was infected, of course she has been on antibiotics for four days, and that treatment could resume.  She goes back to the onocologist this coming Monday but the kicker is in the mean time her unit is being deployed. Of course she can't go and had to go to headquarters and fill them in on what is going on with her. In the meantime we have agreed it's time to put her wishes about her children in writing. I refuse to believe that we are ever going to need that will to be readbut it is something she needs to do for her own peace of mind. Iris is going to be here a long time and I pray every day that her children don't have to face a life without their mom at such a young age. I pray she lives to a nice old age and kicks this cancer in the butt. The only thing I can do for her is pray, be there for support, and help her with the kids. Sometimes my family doesn't understand but I remind them of how my mother died from cancer and how I can't let her do this alone. Yes her family is there for her but it's different with the two of us. We are like sisters and she needs me right now by her side. She needs someone she can talk to and cry to. She needs someone to understand what she is going through and to be tough for her even though I cry behind closed doors. She will never see tears from my eyes only hope. May God hear my prayers and bless her. I have to believe he already has because she had come a hell of a long way.

      Reading the newspapers, hearing how so many have died in Iraq since the start of this war on terrorism, and knowing how many more are still there on this memorial day should be a wake up call for all Americans. I know this war has gone on longer than we had hoped, then we believed, but no matter how long it takes us to get our soldiers home our support for them should never falter. The American people need to stand behind all those brave young men and women still out there fighting so we can be safe. No matter how much we doubt the reason they are there we should never take away our support of the soldiers still there fighting so we can be free. I have had family fighting in wars for this country since World War I, my husbands family goes back to the start of this country, to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Needless to say we believe in this country and all it stands for and to get what we have here many have died for, to preserve it. Today is a day to honor those lost and those still fighting, still serving, willing to give their lives for what they believe in.   I think it's also a time for the American people to sit back and thank these brave men and women for all they have because without them we may not be the country we are today. From the beginning we fought for our independence and won it. With it came the responsibility of keeping it, keeping the people of our great nation free. I don't know about you but I think they have done a good job. I want to take the time to thank all those soldiers past and present for making sure I can walk in a free land, breath free air, know the pleasure of being able to decide for myself what I will do with my life. FREEDOM people, it's something we take for granted. Not just all who are born here but all who come here to make this their home. They come from a land where people are starving, living on top of each other, in shacks, whatever the conditions they come here for a better life then they knock it. This country was founded by immigrants and it was immigrants who have continued to fight for it. My grandparents came from Italy and their children fought for this country. I am proud to say my grandparents became citizens because they believed in the American way. They wanted to be a part of the country they lived in and they never stood here and told me how things were better for them in Italy. They always told me to be proud I am an American, proud of this country and those who run it. Yes they will make mistakes along the way but life here is different then any where else and we should consider ourselves lucky to be able to live it the way we want to.   There's an old saying, "Stop and Smell the Roses." Everyone should stop and think for a minute today about what they have in their life to thank a soldier for and the next time you see a young soldier in uniform take a moment to say, "Thank you for all you have done for me." I was touched by a woman I met in the doctors office recently. We started talking while our husbands were waiting to receive a test. I mentioned my husband was retired Navy. When he came out to the area we were waiting in she thanked him for serving this country for 20 years and keeping us safe from harms way, keeping us FREE. In my opinion it wouldn't hurt to say thank you, let the soldiers know just how much we do appreciate the air we breath. Even if you don't agree with why we are there any more you have to admit if it wasn't for them past and present we may not be able to have to new house with only one family living in it, the two cars in the driveway, and anything else in life we take for granted. Yes we earned it, worked hard for it, but without the Freedom to achieve it....Think about the word FREEDOM. What does it mean to you? How did this great nation obtain it? How can we keep it? With out freedom we may not be able to talk about not agreeing with the way our President runs our country, and the law makers on Capitol Hill. Think about our children and teach them the pride they should have not only the house they live in and the things they posses but in the land they live in. Teach them to be Proud of their Flag and the soldiers who fought to keep it hanging high, to keep the air they breath free. We are Americans from the United States of America, this is our Glory! urlLink

      I have to say I am really scared this War for Iraqi Freedom is about to turn into, if it hasn't already, another Viet Nam. Listening to the news this week and hearing how our soldiers are being ridiculed for their treatment of Iraqi prisoners concerns me. I know it's not right to abuse anyone in this world but it seems to me the people of this country that are crying out how unfair we, our soldiers, are to those poor prisoners are forgetting the horror stories of our soldiers who were held by the Iraqis. Not just our soldiers but what about the civilians that were P.O.W.'s have we forgotten them and some of the scenes we saw? We are in a land, once again, where they don't want us, so let's leave. Let them destroy themselves, not us. My husband served in Desert Storm and although I was not married to him at the time I am still proud of what he did for our country. Every one is worried about finding or not finding as the case may be, these weapons of mass destruction. Well I have not been in Iraq but from what I am told there are many places these weapons can be hidden or even buried. Look where their great leader was found. What makes you think if he would bury himself underground he wouldn't bury his weapons. With all that sand how long do you think it would take to find where they were hidden? Some people are outraged at the treatment of these prisoners but I have to ask this question, Have you really forgotten what they did to our men and women when they were held prisoners? Is it really so easy to forgive and forget because you aren't there to see it up close and personal? Well it's not easy for me because not only do I remember what happened only a short time ago I remember how the American People turned against our soldiers in Viet Nam. Don't let that happen again stand up for our Soldiers, stand behind them and put yourself in their shoes. Try to imagine the horrors they have seen not just in war but in this so called time when we are there just to help them rebuild and have lost more soldiers now then when we were fighting. We are not there so we can not say what is truly happening and what isn't but we were here on 9/11 and that I will never forget. It was a violent act against this entire country. For those among us who served in Iraq perhaps you should help educate the people of this country on just how wonderful the Iraqi people think we are. How they teach their children to hate us from the day they are born so that when they think of Americans they think of killing. Our soldiers may not have done everything by the book but it doesn't need to be paraded on National television it needs to be taken care of by Our Government not the media. In my opinion the Media is our worst enemy and they need to step back and let the Government do their job and perhaps remember all of their co workers who have been sent there and aren't going to be coming home.I am no different then anyone else in this country, when I heard the stories about the mistreating of the prisoners I was shocked but I also remembered the stories of our soldiers who were P.O.W.'s and wasn't there just a beheading that was televised not to long ago? I am not saying two wrongs make a right I am saying the media needs to let the right people do their jobs then they can have the story they are supposed to be looking for, The Truth!   I do believe in freedom of the press, especially since I am a writer, but I do not understand the need to poison the public against our soldiers. None of us want to see them there but to report things that would turn this country against the soldiers at a time when the majority of them need to know we are behind them, doesn't make sense. We are a people who believe in fairness and would not want our sons or daughters mistreated if they were somehow caught and held as prisoners but in reality we know things don't always work out that way. Of course we would expect something to be done about the matter just as we would expect something to be done about the mistreating of prisoners, if in fact that is what happened, while in our care but let's not try it on the six o'clock news, is what I am saying. Let the proper authorities do their job. Let them investigate the allegations and do what they are there to do. You can't take a word from a statement and turn it into a story you need all the facts to be a good, honest, respectable, journalist. Find out the rules of the Geneva convention before you start accusing, then investigate to see if the allegations are true, hence the word investigative reporter. Above all remember a person is innocent until proven guilty.

      Twenty one years ago Memorial Day became extra special to me because it was the day my oldest son was born. Now I had two children in my life that brought me joy and happiness! Two children I was able to love, cherrish, and yes, spoil just a bit.   urlLink      urlLink      Memorial Day has always been a special day for me when I was growing up. Not only did it start the weekend bbq's but it gave us a chance to say Thankyou to all those special veterans in our lives. In my family, on my block, there were a lot of them. I had Uncles and neighbors who survived prison camps in WWII, most of whom didn't like to talk about it. I also had friends who served in Viet Nam and came back to a world of hate for doing what the Government sent them to do.  urlLink    What Americans seem to forget was they didn't just go there on their own they were ordered there and did the best they could do to fight for what they believed in, Freedom. For this we need to say Thank you to those who fought so we can walk free today.        I am proud to say my husband, of four years this July 16, is retired from the United States Navy where he served 20 years. Most of that time he served as a Corpsman. Since we met and married I have met many a Veteran who told me how happy they were to meet my husband because he was a Corpsman and for all they knew he may have been one who helped to save their life at one time or another.        It's sad we have to send our young men and women to foreign shores to fight for others, but in fighting for others to have their freedom they are still fighting for us to keep ours. Think about it! If freedom is lost to others then it will one day be lost to us because we will be at the mercy of the next Hitler who wants to rule the world or any other terrorist who feels he can walk into this country and do whatever he pleases because they hate what we stand for, LIFE, LIBERTY, PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS!   urlLink        urlLink    HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO ALL WHO SERVED OR ARE SERVING!      urlLink

           Woke up this morning to rain and dark skies but it seems to be brightening   up.  I have a few errands to run before I have to go to my sons game tonight. He   had a great game yesterday. He went 3 for 4. Hit a homerun in the first inning   drove in two of the three runs scored. They won 3-0. Not bad for a sophmore playing varsity ball. The team's record is 12-6. They have a tough week coming up starting with tonights game. Go Saint Mary's!                     urlLink             All American Game           urlLink             Baseball, the all American game,                                  No two players are ever the same.                        Ruth, Mantel, Di Maggio,          Some of the names that made you go,                            Watch the game, cheer them on,          Still cheering long after their gone.          New faces and names,          Yet the game is still the same.          Four balls you walk, three strikes your out,          Hitting the ball is what it's about.          Rounding the bases to cheers from the crowd,          Doing your job makes you proud.          Win or lose it's how you play,          No matter what the fans say.          Some will boo others cheer,          Bleneded sounds is what you hear.          Makes no difference what they say,          Baseball is what your here to play.          Stand as a team together and strong,          The crack of the bat is your music, your song.

      I'm sitting here looking out the window enjoying the beautiful sunshine. I love this time of the year. Everything is in bloom. In my town the streets are lined with cherryblossom trees that have already lost their blooms but have become a beautiful green shade tree for the summer months ahead. Our park is even called Cherryblossomland. It's beautiful to see when all the blossoms are in bloom. People come from all over to see for themselves this collection of beauty. On Sundays the park is filled with families and friends who go to see the beauty and soak it all in. It makes you realize just how short life really is and how important it is to notice all around you. The blossoms are only in bloom for two weeks and if you miss it you won't get to see it again for another year. Sad but true, the comming of the Cherryblossoms marks the start of new life for a new season short lived.  I am enjoying my life and those around me because a long time ago I learned just how short and percious life really is. Not just by lossing those I love. Twenty two years ago I almost lost my life as well as the life of my daughter when I was giving birth to her. I am so thankful to God for giving me the chance to raise her into the wonderful woman she has become. I am thankful for being able to see that beauty emerge as well as being thankful for the ability to see the beauty around me. This time of the year is so colorful and bright. It makes you realize just how wonderful life really is. Sit outside, close your eyes, listen to the sounds around you. Yes there's traffic noises but what about the sounds of the birds chirping, the plane over head, dogs barking, children playing, the lawn mower going, laughter of neighbors as they meet and talk over the fence joining their yards, and the sound of music drifting out from a nearby window. These are some of the sounds I hear as I close my eyes and listen. At the same time you could smell the freshly cut grass of your neighbors yard, the lillies you planted a week earlier, the scent of the marigolds in bloom, in other words the smell of spring, the smell of life.   Today I am going to watch my youngest son play baseball and for a short time lose myself in the game. I love watching him, seeing the young man he has become. The changes that have occured to him as he matured into the young man that stands before me, not only in his behavior but in his game of baseball. I am so proud of my children. I know I talk about them alot but when you think about it I have a right too. I was a single mother for seven years of their lives but even when their father was with us, he wasn't. My children have become the people they are because of who they are not because of their father or their mother but because of their love for those around them and their belief. Perhaps I am responsible for their belief part but each of them has a love for something in their lives that drives them to be the best they can be. For my daughter, the oldest of the three, she is a social worker who works harder than anyone I know to get what is needed for the people she tries so hard to help. I think it's because of the way we struggled in life that she fights so hard for the children she councels. She listens to them as they call out in pain without really saying too much. You see it wasn't all that long ago she was going through the same pain and I do honestly believe she works so hard for them so they don't have to live through the pain she did as a child. Yes I was always there for them but their father was another story. Now as he has aged some he is beginning to realize just how much he missed and how short life really is. I hope he has the time to get to really know these children and appreciate them. My oldest son is a music education major. He found his peace in his music even though he knew his father beleived it to be a waste of time he kept at it and now he is working toward a degree in music education because he wants to pass on his love for music to other children just as his music teachers have done for him. I am so proud of him. When I think of him teaching it brings tears to my eyes because I always wanted to do just that. Teach the little ones and watch their eyes light up when they get it right. I used to be a preschool teacher but my health now hinders that. I do miss it though. And my youngest right now is focusing on baseball. Perhaps one day he will see his dream to be the best he could be in baseball and play for the pros. I pray for him and his dreams. He is young and that could change but if that is what he truely wants I do believe he will have it. Three great children who have taught me a lot in life too and I am proud to say they are mine. They give life a new meaning every day. If I didn't take the time to stop and enjoy there might have been something I would have missed in their growing up. I am so glad I never missed a beat. I remember every day of their young lives and I hope I am here to make many more memories for myself and for them.  My husband is the step father but he loves them as if they were his own. For this I love him even more. No one could have asked for a better man then he and I was lucky God saw fit to introduce us. When I met my husband four years ago I was reborn. He bought laughter into my life that went beyond that of a mother and her children, I was a woman in my own right for once. He taught me how to live for me and not just the kids. He taught me it was ok to think about myself from time to time. Now this was something I never did even when taking the time to smell the roses I never really took the time to breath when I did. He is the reason I now smile and the reason I remember so much of my past and have come to terms with it bringing on a new life for me, a rebirth if you will.   I hope every one stops to think just how precious life really is and how wonderful it could be. It doesn't take that long to breath and soak it all in. A minute or two is all you need to start but after you get a taste of it I can promise you, you will want more.

      Marlo Ventura sat quietly on the porch of her new home. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the feel of the breeze coming off the lake not more than 200 feet from where she sat. One of the reasons she bought the house was the peacefulness she felt whenever she was there.   Marlo had spent last summer at this very house on vacation. Actually it was supposed to be her honeymoon but it didn't work out that way. Her ex decided he wasn't ready for marriage but he waited till their wedding day to say so.Marlo decided she wasn't going to let a perfectly good honeymoon go to waste so she off she went and she fell in love all over again, but this time it was a little different.  When Marlo first laid eyes on the house she fell in love immediately. It was no surprise when the house went on the market the end of the summer she jumped on the chance to buy it in spite of all the strange things that went on there.  After living in the house for only one night last  summer Marlo woke up to what she thought was the sound of drums playing in the yard but when she looked out she saw nothing, no one, but still the sound of a drum beating continued till she opened the door.  Later that evening she thought she saw a woman standing near the waters edge but as she got closer to the lake the woman disappeared. Marlo looked around to see if she had moved off but there was no one to be seen. As she got to know the house she heard and saw a lot of strange goings and comings but nothing she could prove. After she got to know the people in town they filled her in on the stories of the lake being haunted. At first Marlo thought they were just trying to scare her but the longer she stayed there the more she started to believe in the stories.  She would take it a step further and say more than just the lake was haunted. Marlo believed there was a spirit or spirits in the house and they were trying desperatly to get a message across. Perhaps the events of the summer had a lot to do with her deciding to make a few changes in her life.  When she found out the house was on the market she immediately looked into finding a job in the nearest town which wasn't difficult at all. Marlo landed a job teaching first grade in the school just twenty minutes from home with hardly any morniing traffic to battle in her way to work. Now she had to set things right at home. She left her beautiful summer home and headed back from where she came with only two weeks to get herself packed up and moved out in time for the first day of school. She had made arrangements to remain in the house as a tennant until she actually took ownership of the house. The cost of the rent went towards the downpayment of the house and the closing fees.  When she got home she gave notice to her job, informed her family of the changes she was about to make, and started packing up for the move. Her family, of course, thought it was over being left at the alter. They tried to understand since Marlo kept assuring them she was in no way running from her past but into her future.  Now, a year later, she found herself to be a calmer, happier person, who has learned there is more to life than running errands and rushing through the day.  She has learned that opening your mind gives you a whole new look on the things around you.   Sitting on the porch she has her eyes closed and is listening for the sound of the drums for when they come she knows she will see him again riding his white horse through the clearing, his hair long with one feather in it turned down, besides him walks a gray wolf. He sits tall and proud on his horse as he searches the water, for what she does not know. Maybe it has something to do with the woman she saw when she first arrived the summer before.  Since then he has appeared to her many times each time getting closer and closer to her but then Marlo's fear pops into play and he is gone. This time she intends to keep her fear in check because this time she wants to know exactly what he is there for.

      I some times wish that I could be, A bird perched high up in a tree,  So I can sing a beautiful song  And have others sing along.  I some times wish that I could be A flower growing beneath a tree, To give the world a little color And free the mind of it's clutter.  I some times wish that I could be The grass that grows beneath a tree, To protect a child if they fall, so they will have no scrape at all.  I some times wish that all could see, All the beauty including the tree. Stop, listen, smell, and feel, So life doesn't spin you on a reel.

      I have a little soap boxing to do and I hope you take a moment to listen to me. I promise I will make a point.  It's not that I am a supporter of Howard Stern believe me I am far from it. There are times I have listened to his show and enjoyed parts of it and then there are times I find him rude and obnoxious those are the times I turn him off, it's my right. I have that right because of the Constitution of the United States the same reason he has a right to speak his mind. There is a bill in the House right now waiting to be passed to give the FCC more power than it deserves. I am opposed to that bill not because it would stop shows like Howard's but because it is the first step in the possibility of banning books. This bill gives the FCC the right to say something offends them without having to account to a higher level. They don't have to answer to anyone they just have to say you can't sell that book, or you can't read that book. What about the great books already out there? Are they going to one day decide to take them off the shelves and burn them so that morals of this country remain in tact. Yes I do believe there are some things that should not go across the air waves since radio is a lot harder for a parent to control then television but shouldn't it also be up to the individual what they listen to and what they don't? I am a parent but I feel confident when my children go out into the world they are prepared for what they come up against in life. I prepared them for that and I instilled their morals. Yes my oldest son, now 21, listens to Howard Stern and I asked him one time why he did. He told me Howard makes a lot of sense on many subjects and yes he does get vulgar at times but that has nothing to do with the message he gets across it's just part of is show. He knows how to reach the people. OK, so Howard makes sense and I have to admit I have listened to him and one point I totally agree with was about violence on television. I am not talking about the movies out there today because they are rated and it is up to a parent if they allow a child to watch it in their home. I am talking about the news cast itself every night of the week and how they capitalize on the violence in this world. No they don't curse, they don't show nudity, but they have the right to show the beheading of a prisoner of war. An actual act of violence that doesn't put the actor back together again when the camera stops rolling. There is no way to tell your child that's only make believe because the news isn't supposed to be make believe. Now where do we draw the line. Will the FCC stop the news casters from becoming tabloids such as the Star or Enquirer? Sensationalism is what the news is today and it depends on what candidate the head of the station is backing at the time, the left wing or the right wing. When you have an organization that is willing to give an award to someone like Hanoi Jane, (Jane Fonda Turner, as Ted Turner head of CNN now divorced, ) as women of the year then something is wrong here. Obviously the dictating of what is right and wrong depends on who is in charge at the time whether it is in an organization, news station, radio station, or the person in charge of a country. I always thought it was up to the people themselves at least in this country. I always thought we had the right to vote what we wanted for the better of the people. I think this is one bill that should go to the people. What do you think? Maybe you should let our law makers know.    If you think you should then pass this on.

      This is my husbands eulogy to his father George Payne written here with my husbands permission.  My father, George Arvey Payne, was born on May 10, 1927. He was a loving husband of 59 years, a wonderful father of 6 children, 2 of which are with him now. A man of hard work who believed a day of hard work was a day well sent. A passionate man who exhibited that passion in so many ways, only a few of which include, family, work, travel, nature, adventure, and love of this country.  As every knows, Dad would never turn anyone away, be it family or friend. This love of family was first instilled in him as a young child with the need to help support his widowed mother. His love for his mother enabled her memory to live on long after she was gone as our love for him will ensure he will live on in our hearts forever. He endured many hardships in his time that gave him strength of character which he passed onto those around him.  Although he did work hard for so many years he still managed to spend time with the family. This was quality time spent on family vacations, weekend outings, camping, fishing on many lakes and rivers, and motor cycle riding, all of which we enjoyed immensely. He gave us memories we will cherish always and pass onto his grandchildren and great grandchildren, the numbers of which could populate a small town. I remember one time in particular he came home with this large color television. As he hooked it up, with all of us watching with anticipation, he said he wanted his family to be one of the first in town to own a color television.  He taught us to work hard, nothing is ever handed to you. Be proud of who you are, what you are. Believe in yourself and in your family. He taught these lessons to us through example.  Growing up he was a good provider. In later years he was a good friend. I feel blessed for having that friendship that made him more than a father and I will cherish that for the rest of my life.  The proudest moment of my life was the day I retired from the Navy. I had the privilege of including my father in the ceremony to thank him for making me the man I am today.  He has given me many reasons to look up to him over the years. I always admired his strength. Not his physical strength, his inner strength, his will. There was a time when he was told to change his lifestyle to prolong his life. As he left the doctors office he decided right then and there he would do just that and he did, on a couple of occasions. There aren't many people who could say they have that kind of inner strength.  It has been my privilege to have a father who has become such a gentle, kind, and loving soul. One who is loved and respected by all who knew him. I'm proud to call this man my father.  We all will miss him but I stand here before you to tell you I know he is with all his loved ones who have passed on and he no longer suffers. Perhaps if you close your eyes you cam see him standing on a river bank fishing with his children, brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, and all the others that have gone on before him. Laughing, smiling, singing a song, telling a joke. These are my memories of him.  On behalf of my mother Carolee, my sisters, Carol, Sandy, Barbie, and myself, I would like to take this time to thank everyone for coming.  Peace be with you.

      I couldn't believe my ears that terrible morning of 911. The sites I saw over the next few days will live with me forever as I know they will live with most Americans. So many people killed and for what? We may never have the answers we want but we already have the truth. We were attacked and our family, friends, neighbors, children were killed because some people on the other side of the ocean don't like the way we live. They don't like our freedoms, they don't believe in our God, my God, your God, they only believe in their God. Sad because their God preaches death ours is loving and forgiving. We all know that no matter what religion we are God is forgiving and loving, not full of hate.   This isn't about religion, all this nonsense going on since 911. Hearings to see if the President knew more than he let the people know for one thing. Well I for one would hope he did know more than we did and perhaps they were in more control than we thought. We may never know that but we can't keep second guessing every one it needs to be put to rest so those who were killed on that fatefull day could finally rest.   Another thing that disturbs me is complaining about the war in Iraq. There's no sense in it. All the people of this country need to remember is 911. I understand there are rules that protect the Iraqi prisoners just like there are rules that are supposed to protect American POW's but it's not working that way. The people of this country need to stop feeling sorry for the Iraqi people and need to realize from the day they are born these people are taught to hate. Not just Americans but any one who is not like them. They teach 2 year olds to hate and distrust while we teach our children to love and cherish that around them. We love our freedom and want what is best for our children, want them to be happy and want to see them do well in life. We want others in this world to feel the same way we feel but we can not force it on them.   I am not crazy about war but I do understand why we went there. I am not saying people should be tortured but I do understand in times of war there are sometimes things that can not be controlled or dictated by bleeding heart liberals. I remember stories of the first American POW's taken in Iraq and how they were tortured and no one cried out for them they just reported the news as if we were the ones wrong no matter what the outcome, no matter how many soldiers were captured, no matter how many were killed, we were in a land where the people didn't want us. We were wrong. Maybe it doesn't make sense to every one why we are there but we are not the President of the United states. We the people elected our President so he can do what he thinks is best for this country and it's people. I will stand behind him and our troops in Iraq and I will pray for their safe return as I am sure so many of you are. What we need to understand is the Government has information, I believe, that we do not have and it should be that way. There is no reason for the news people to be sticking their noses into things that don't concern them. There is no reason for them to be aware of where we are in this fight or what action we are taking next the only people that need to know that information wear the uniforms of the armed forces of this Great Nation.  Although I will stand behind the President I also believe in my heart it is time for the United States to say goodbye to Iraq and it's people and No to others who come to us for help or who we believe need our help to be free because no matter what we are always wrong in the eyes of the world including some of the world that lives on our shores. It is time for the American people to stand up and be counted, to tell the government of this free nation we do not want to keep letting every one and anyone into our country. We want our country back. WE want to be able to walk in a store and hear people speaking engish, to have the freedom to chose whatever language we want to study in school not just a chosen one or two. We want to be able to understand the person we buy our newpapers from in the morning, We want to be able to walk our fair streets with out the fear of a bomb going off or a threat of some kind. What needs to be done in my opinion is to bring our troops home to guard our boarders and start saying no to those who want to come in this country, knock it, hate it, and make their money here so they can bring it home. We need to stop giving money to immigrants so they have a nest egg and open the next 711 in the neighborhood. We need to start taking care of those already here and then worry about new people in the furture. It's time to stand together so those nations around us know we are what we say we are United, as in the United States of America.  We the people, citizens of this great nation, need to stand up and be heard. We need to let those who don't like this country know they should leave, it wouldn't bother us in the least, as a matter of fact it's because of this great freedom we have, every one has the freedom to do as they please, leave or stay, the choice is theirs. There should be rules to become a citizen or be made to leave the country by a certain time if they chose not to be a citizen. Work for what they get not have it handed to them just because,when those born here can't get help they need to do better for themselves. It's not easy running a country, if it were every one would be doing it. So it's not right to second guess what should and should not be done since it is impossible for the people to know all the secrets. If we were told every thing going on behind the sceens through the news then we can rest assure a lot more will die over there and it will be on our side because we had to give up our secrets.   The American people need to remember 911, the fear we felt, the saddness, the crying, the dead. We need to remember how happy the Iraqi's get at the thought of an American's death, the cheers we have heard ourselves from the news cast. We need to remember this is our country and who ever doesn't like it can leave. WE need to stand up and be united, be one, let the world hear us tell them we aren't going to take it any more. If you don't like us go somewhere else to get help if you do like it then become a citizen. The United States has always been a melting pot but right now the pot is boiling over. The citizens of this country need to be one. We need to be United and strong.

      I am writing this as a goodbye to a wonderful man, my father-in-law, George Payne. I first met him on July 18, 2000 when my husband and I were honeymooning in Colorado. It was a combination see the state, honeymoon, meet the parents but it was wonderful. From the first minute we met I knew what a great man he was. His love for his son could be felt from the way he looked at him.   Unfortunately my father in law passed away on July 9, 2004. My husband Lee and I arrived in Colorado on Thursday for the services and to be there in case his mom needed us. I was more than happy to be there for all of them. I know it is what he would have wanted.   He has been ill for some time but over the past four years that I have had the privaledge and honor of knowing him he has gotten worse. I guess that all started when he broke his hip about three years ago. This past winter we had a scare and my husband went alone to see him and be there in case something happened. I am so happy they had that time together. I know it meant a lot of his father because Dad told me it did when I talked to him and he thanked me for letting his son go. I wouldn't have had it any other way. He was where he belonged.   I remember that first time I laid eyes on Dad. I entered his house as his new daughter in law and he welcomed me with opened arms. During the time we spent at his house both he and Mom made me feel as if I was part of their family and I love them both very much for that. He took me on a site seeing tour showing me all the beautiful sites around their home. I felt as if I had known him all my life.   As I got to know him I better I got to know the man himself. What I saw was a man with a big heart. He loved his family more than he could ever tell them so he tried his best to show them in the little things he did for them like talking to them on the phone, visiting them, the ones that lived close enough for him to visit, taking care of his great grandchild whenever they needed him and Great Grandma to do so. In all the times I talked to him on the phone long before I met him face to face he told me he loved me whenever we said our goodbyes. This man deserved to be happy and to be with his family.  From what I could see and the stories I was told he loved to make people think he was this tough guy but in actuality he had a heart of gold. Last summer he opened his home to me and my family. I am so glad my son got to meet him and I am thrilled he got to know my son. After all he was my children's step grandfather and they couldn't have asked for a better one. During the services the children talked about their memories of their father and I wished I had been around then. He was tough when he needed to be but he was always there for them and he tried to make his time with his family quality time by taking them fishing, camping, on vacations, and doing whatever he could do to enjoy their time together.   My husband said in his eulogy to his father that he is proud to call him his father, well I am proud I got the same chance even though it was through marriage. He was a good man, sweet, kind, loved by all who met him, he did what he could to help anyone in need, he was the kind of man you want on your side when times were tough and someone to share the good times with.   He's gone home now to be with the members of his family that have gone before him but he will always be with us. He will be watching over his family, making sure he is there to guide them, leting them know he will never be far. His love for them as their love for him will live on forever.   George Payne was married to his wife Carolee for 59 years. They had four children, three girls and one boy. They are blessed with seven grandchildren, 3 step grandchildren, and 18 great grandchildren soon to be 20. That's a lot of love to give and a lot of love to recieve. I am proud to say I not only knew George Payne, I loved him like a father. He never made me feel like a visitor or an in law I always felt as if I were home. I will miss you Dad, Love You Toni

      The phone rings in the middle of the night and fear grips you because you know something happened you really don't want to hear about. The other night my son was late getting home so I called his cell phone only to find out he was just down the street with my Aunt. Her boyfriend, of fourteen years, died. Although they were never married he was an Uncle to all of uss all the same. True he wasn't young but if you knew him you would never think of his 83 years or so as being old. He was so full of life, always a nice word, a smile that was contagious, and always keeping himself busy. He always said he felt like a young man just the body was getting older. At this time no one knows why he died since he wasn't sick or feeling ill. As a matter of fact he was sitting outside talking to some friends only hours before he was found. For him I pray for a peace everlasting. For those he suddenly left behind I pray they heal. He was an extremely loved man.   Right now I am trying to help my youngest son deal with this. He was sleeping when we found out about the death so I didn't tell him. The next day his father, whom he lives with, took him to school so I didn't get to see him. However, after school his friend picked him up and told him what had happened. My son immediately called me extremely upset. I felt so sad for him. Yes he had other deaths in the family over the years, many of them, but this one he was close to. Perhaps because he is older now he realized how final death is or perhaps it's because the man we are all mourning was always so good to him. He took the time to talk to  a sixteen year old boy and get to know him when others just thought he was in the way. He will surely be missed by so many. I have told my son to remember him for all the good he did and for how good he made you feel. I told him to take a lesson from our Uncle's  book and remember it's always better to have a kind word to say to someone or about someone. He always looked on the bright side and would help anyone if they needed it no matter what the situation.  I am hoping my son will help us keep up my Uncle's garden and the rest of the property around my Aunt's house as a tribut to a wonderful man. I told him it would make our Uncle very happy to know we are taking care of things for him. Perhaps it will also help my son feel close to him and know even though our Uncle was only here for a short time, like we all are, he will always be with us. In our thoughts, in our hearts, and always watching over us. He touched so many lives and I pray for him to rest in peace. He will be with us always.

      Usually I am a quiet person. I like to keep to myself and care for my family but when some thing upsets me lately I speak out. Is that a good thing? I'm not so sure but a doctor would tell you it's better than keeping it in. At least you won't give yourself an ulcer.  I can only imagine how many woman and men out there got married till death they do part. None of us ever expect to get a divorce or go into it figuring if it doesn't work out a divorce is a option. Yet we know only too many end up that way and with it the people that weren't there to help in the marriage decission get hurt. Who am I talking about? The children, of course. They didn't ask to brought into this world. They don't even ask for anything we shouldn't be willing to give, just love and support.  Now although it is usually the woman that is given custody and recieves child support from her ex spouse there are times that it is reversed and the father has custody of the children and the mother pays child support. I guess one of the things that bothers me about divorce is the inability to have your support on time. I'm not talking about allimony because for me I gave up my right to that. I wanted the little bit of money he was willing to give to go directly to my children. At first I thought it best if I collect my support every week, that was a mistake.  I am sure there are many of you out there who listened to their lawyer and gave their ex spouse a chance to pay on his or her own. Unfortunately it doesn't always work out. I had to run around and chase him for the money and then I had to put up with his insults besides. Not for nothing but I am no longer married to him why would I want to have so much contact with him except for the children. After a while I had to stop working due to an auto accident. Unfortunately that put me on public assistance, or was it unfortunate? You see by having to get help from the county their probation department got involved and he was immediately put on probation so they were sure I was getting my support.  Now here's the catch 22, if he sent them support for my children I didn't get it but once a month instead of once a week but it turned out they held onto it at times for two months at a time before I recieved the money that was supposed to help me not need public assisatance. What a joke. He gave me $ 100 a week for three chidren but it never got to me on time. The county turned out to be just as bad as he was. After a while of him paying through the county they sent him a letter, on a number of occassions, telling him he was behind. He had to appear in court with his cancelled checks and any other proof he had that he paid the support and if he didn't he had to bring the money with him he was in the rears for. Half the time they came up with some reason not to send me the entire amount at one time and again I was left waiting for support for the children.  After I remarried my ex asked me if I would consider taking him out of the system. He promised he would pay me on time and I agreed. It's amazing it didn't take him all that long to be removed from the system and forgotten about. It also didn't take him all that long to fall behind. He decided since he has my youngest son now living with him he doesn't need to help with the older two who are working their way through college and getting every and any college loan they could. He sees nothing wrong with not helping them because he feels he takes care of the expenses of our youngest son. I never gave up my custody to my ex so if I wanted to pursue it and go after him for support I could but the truth of the matter is the money, at this point, isn't that important.  What is important is he isn't there for the older two children and never has been. My oldest son, now 21, said he wishes his father would have allowed him to live with him for a while. Not because he didn't want to be with me but because he needed to have his father around. He needed that time with him, to get to know him, to bond. He never had that. As a matter of fact he was and still is the type of father who never took his visitation unless it was forced on him and I didn't like to force the issue because the children felt unwanted by him and his wife.   Yes it is important to recieve the financial support from your ex but more importantly the children need the emotional support, the love and caring of two parents. You don't have to stay together for the sake of the kids but you do have to be there for them no matter what. They need to know they are still going to have two parents who will always be there for them. Too often when the parent the children do not live with remarries or finds someone to spend time with they forget they have children. They don't make the time to be there and then when something happens the question will be to the parent in charge, "Where were you?" or "What were you doing when all this happened?" I can't tell you how many times my ex accused me of not paying attention to them because their grades slipped or they got hurt doing something around the house. The funny thing was since the day my daughter was born 22 years ago, he was never there. He never saw anything unless it was something he could complain about. My children can tell you if they got a 99 on an assignment their father would complain it wasn't a 100 instead of being proud of their accomplishments.  Parents need to remember to tell their children just how proud of them they are. They need to show their support as well as give it. They need to be there for the children today because too many of them are losing their way. We can blame the schools, the police, the neighborhood we live in, but what it really comes down to is the parents. Yes we go to work, we're tired, at times worn out but we are parents and we need to take a page from our parents or grandparents book and pay attention to our children. Know what they are doing, know who they are, know what they want in life. Teach them to believe in themselves and to know they can be anything they want to be some just have to work at it harder than others.

      Marlo had walked the short cut through the trees many times just to get a little exercise herself but she never ventured to the top of the cliff. As she neared the top of the path she started having a hard time breathing. She stopped for a second and put her hand on her chest. Matt was getting concerned. Marlo was in good physical condition so there was no way this walk should be hurting her yet, she was struggling to breath. She was taking short gasps instead of regular breaths.  As they reached the top of the path Marlo stopped for a minute to catch her breath but she knew it had nothing to do with the walk up the path. She had walked much steeper paths and even went hiking and never had this reaction. No, she knew something was there and that something didn't want her here. The area at the top of the cliff was beautiful. There were pine trees and wild flowers. The path continued in two directions.  One was to the edge of the cliff and the other was in the opposite direction. Marlo decided to choose the latter and went in the opposite direction of the cliff. Matt was surprised by her choice as he stood close by. He was well aware something was going on with her but he figured he would let her do her thing and stick close by in case she needed him. There was no way he would let anything hurt her. It's one of the reasons he insisted he would investigate with her. Matt may not believe something or someone lives in this place but he knew Marlo believed it and that could work against her. After all, they say if you believe in something then it is bound to come true.  Not far along the path they came to a clearing. Marlo stopped and stood in the center of the clearing. The wind picked up, dirt started blowing around pushing her back down the path but she didn't give up. It was as if they had walked into the wind of a hurricane but she wasn't about to give up. She pushed hard and continued on with Matt close by her side. Not far from the clearing Marlo stopped, turned and looked at Matt. The wind died down as Marlo started talking to Matt, in another language.  "Gibi-ayaa! Ningii-ayaa waiting!" Her arms were out stretched towards him. Matt stood in amazement. She looked no different yet she spoke a language Matt knew she had no knowledge of. He, however did understand exactly what she was saying to him and this amazed him. He wasn't sure how he understood her since it wasn't a language he spoke yet it was one he was interested in when he was younger. "ninaabem gidaaw!Gigii-wanike na?" She paused for a moment as if waiting for Matt to answer her. Marlo turned her head slightly, her expression was sad as she continued, "ndingaa'ig they!"She held up two fingers, "ningii-wani'igoo, gigii-mikaw. Ma'iingan nebaad, ninaabem." Marlo collapsed to the ground in tears. Although she wasn't sure what had happened she knew she could feel the pain of the woman she had seen so many times before.  Matt helped her get to her feet and put his arm around her gently. He took a few minutes to explain what happened to her while she caught her breath. She was shocked when he told her he understood what she was saying.  "Do you speak that language? Do you know what language it is?" Marlo was excited. She was anxious to find out how she could be of help to the woman and perhaps help her to finally rest.  "Well at first I was shocked but then as I listened I was able to understand what you were saying. I've never spoken the language before, to my knowledge, but I do know it is from the Native American tribe that lived on this land. "She motioned for him to hurry up and give her the name of the tribe. Her hands were doing her talking as she asked him to come on with it already, without saying a word. "The Ojibwa in English it's pronounced and spelled Chippewa. I have always loved to study about the different tribes that lived in this country. The Chippewa was easy since they are from this area. There are reservations where the people still speak their native language. Many tribes fight to preserve their heritage." Marlo put a hand up to stop him.  "Sorry Matt but I don't need a history lesson. I do, however, need to know what the hell is going on around here. If you understood her then what did she say?"  "Ok, if I am not completely losing my mind, she said she had been waiting for me," he started shuffling his feet again.  "She must have said more than that so come one and stop doing that with your feet, just tell me!  Matt wasn't aware he was doing anything with his feet because it was a habit he had when ever he got nervous since he was a young boy. "I believe she asked me if I forgot I was her husband." Marlo shot a look at him. Her eyes opened wide in shock. "She also said someone hurt her, plural because she used the word they and held up two fingers. It seems she has been lost since then and thinks I have found her. She called me by a name that couldn't possibly be right and then referred to him, to me, whatever, as husband."  Marlo didn't know what to make about any of this. For starters why did this happen to her and why is this spirit appearing to her not to mention the appearance of the rider on the white horse. "We need to check out the rest of this area and move down to the cliff and below then perhaps we can go back to my place for some lunch and go over everything." Matt nodded his head in agreement. Right now getting out of there sounded good to him. He was worried this was going to be something Marlo wouldn't be able to set aside unless someone was with her. He had heard stories once you become open to the spirit world it is impossible to shut it off. Of course he didn't believe in the spirit world so he was still hoping for a logical explanation of the days events.  They searched the rest of the area at the top of the cliff and then headed towards the bottom. Marlo wanted desperately to find out who she was and why she chose to come to her and speak to Matt. There had been many people over the years she could have haunted what made them so special.  As they headed down the path Marlo started to feel scared. Her eyes darted all around her. She felt as though she should run as if someone or something was chasing her. She started to run down the path towards the edge of the cliff when Matt reached out and grabbed her. "This just isn't your day. You can't tell me you don't see something, anything!" Marlo nodded her head. That's exactly what she could tell him and did. At the bottom of the cliff Marlo searched frantically. She wasn't sure exactly what she was looking for but she believed she would know it when she found it.  Of course there was nothing that jumped right out at her and the agreement was to have a look around then go to the house, have lunch, and try to figure all of this out. She intended to do just that. Exhausted, confused, excited, overwhelmed were the feelings she was having as they walked down the path and out the clearing heading for her home.  Once again they past Mrs. Wallingsworth but this time Matt had his arm around Marlo's waist giving her a little support since she was shaken up. He couldn't explain anything that happened in there but he did know what he heard and what he saw. Although there was nothing he could say as far as a woman goes, he did see and feel the winds that whipped up out of no where, he heard Marlo speak another language she had no knowledge of, he saw the fear and panic in her face as she almost ran off the cliff. What he didn't know was what caused all of this. As they passed Mrs. Wallingsworth they said their hello's and walked quietly to Marlo's front porch where they sat down for a minute before going into the house. Matt wasn't sure what to say to her but he did know they needed to figure this out because what happened out there was far from normal. "Has anything like that ever happened to you before?" He asked Marlo as she poured them both a glass of iced tea.  "No, I can honestly say it never has and I hope it never does again. I mean I could feel her pain and her fear. I couldn't fight her off but I didn't feel afraid of her either I felt," she paused for a second pacing around the kitchen, "sorry for her. I felt as though she needed help. I wasn't sure at first what it was but something or someone was showing me the way to go up that path. There was also something trying very hard to keep me away, to keep us away."  "So I noticed. But there was nothing I could see. Oh yeah, the wind fought hard against us but I didn't see any thing there. Am I missing some thing?" He looked at Marlo waiting for an answer. "Well is there some thing, any thing you could tell me besides what we already know?"  Marlo knew he was freaked out by what had happened and who wouldn't be. Matt was a the type of person who believed in what he saw and he saw nothing he could put his finger on. "I can tell you she was killed by two men many years ago. She is searching for something or someone. If you want my opinion it is someone I think she loved very much"  "If I understood her right it was her husband whom she called Sleeping Wolf. There is a legend that he walks the lake in search for his wife. I don't know the entire story but there must be something about it at the library. Unfortunately the library is closed already and won't be opened again until Monday." He was frustrated to think they had to put off their research until then.  "Does the local library have a webpage?"  Matt wasn't sure,"Well, I can do a little research on that if they do. Maybe, just maybe, there will be something in their archives about this so called legend." Her face brightened up and Matt couldn't help but love the look in her eyes as the idea came to her. "I'll get right on it and see what we can come up with. Come on," she tugged him up from his seat pulling him along into her computer room. She sat in front of her computer and typed in a few command words for the search engine and before she knew it she found the library webpage. For the next few hours the two of them searched for what ever information there was on the legend of the warrior known as Sleeping Wolf. What they found out amazed them.  To be continued.......

Exhausted, confused, excited, overwhelmed were the feelings she was having as they walked down the path and out to the clearing heading for her home.&nbsp;  &nbsp; TO BE CONTINUED........ &nbsp;

      As promised early Saturday morning Matt Hamilton was sitting on Marlo's front porch when she opened it to get the milk delivery. One thing she liked about living out on the farm was the milk delivery. It reminded her of stories her mother used to tell her of her childhood when the milk man delivered milk and the egg man delivered eggs and so on. Her mother said at least then you knew everything was fresh now you have to wonder how long it,s been on the shelf.   When Marlo opened the door she was startled at first to see someone sitting on her porch then she was a embarrassed because she realized she was still in her pajamas. Matt stood up and tipped his hat to her as he said good morning. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you but we did say early and I forgot to ask what early was to you.   She smiled at him, "Well to be honest with you Matt I've been up for hours working on my computer but haven't gotten around to gathering up the milk and taking a shower. Since she didn't have a robe on there was nothing to pull around herself so she stood there embarrassed to be in her pajamas but glad she didn't have on anything too sexy. It would have been too much so early in the morning. Please come in.   No that's ok. He put his hand up. I'll just wait for you here. It wouldn't look right if I came in there and you weren't dressed. Now Marlo looked puzzled as she looked around outside the house to see who else was there.   Ok, so, who would know? There's nobody here for at least half a mile.   Well you never can tell. Like I said last night this is a small town and I don't want people to start talking about you. She couldn't help but smile because he was worried about her reputation and she thought she should be too since she was a teacher in this small town. She asked him to give her a few minutes to freshen up and then they could grab a cup of coffee and some breakfast before going off into the woods. Once again he tipped his hat to her, smiling after her as she closed the door.   It didn't take Marlo long to get herself showered and dressed. After all she had great incentive, Matt Hamilton. Although she couldn't figure out what brought him out here the night before. He never showed her interest in school and they really didn't know each other all that well. She couldn't help but think about that as she showered but she figured if she was ever going to figure it out she would have to get herself out there and talk to him about it herself. After all she was a modern woman in modern times, she could just come right out and ask him why all of a sudden did he decide to stop by and ask her out for ice cream.   Marlo found herself rushing to get dressed but she wasn't sure if it was because she had someone waiting for her on the front porch or that some was Matt. From the first day she started to work at the school she noticed him. You couldn't help but notice him he was just shy of six feet tall from what she could figure. He shaved his head bald and he had blue eyes. He always wore a cowboy hat that seemed to bring out the beauty of his eyes. She never really talked to him except to say good morning or have a nice night. He was well fit but from what she understood from the ladies in the school he loved to go for long walks and he often went hiking and running. She got the impression, from the other female teachers, he was a loner.   As he said this is a small town and people love to talk. It's one of the great past times. It seems young Mr. Hamilton, as some of the older teachers have referred to him as, was in a relationship with his childhood sweetheart until about three years ago. Then one day she just up and left. Without so much as a "How do you do." Since then Matt has kept to himself. Oh the ladies have tried to set him up from time to time but nothing seemed to work. He just wasn't interested. They were starting to wonder if he was a "real man" or if that was the reason Susie Macintire left. Marlo tried not to listen to the stories but it's hard when people seem to want to tell you even if you don't want to hear it. She could only imagine what they have said about her situation and why she was now living here.   When she was finally ready she went to the front door to let Matt in. He stood as the front door opened and then didn't move. He just stood there starring at her. Marlo didn't give herself much credit. As a matter of fact she blamed herself for her breakup the previous year. She believed if she just lost those extra ten pounds or so, maybe changed her hair, fixed herself up more, maybe then he would have stayed around. Oh, her ex told her it had nothing to do with her but she didn't believe him. When Marlo looked in the mirror she didn't see the beauty that Matt was looking at right now. Marlo Ventura stands about 5 ft.. 5 in. tall. Her hair has always been short because she hated fussing with it. It wasn't cut as short as a mans of course but she kept it nicely styled and it had a sort of bounce to it. She was proud of the fact that it was her natural color Auburn. Most people asked her what she used in her hair and when she told them it was natural they really didn't believe her. Her eyes were green and showed every one of her emotions. Right now with Matt standing there starring at her in her blue jean shorts, blue and white tee shirt, and sneakers she looked a bit confused.   Matt must have realized he was starring and apologized,"It's just you look nice. I like the outfit." He shuffled his feet a little. She smiled as she opened the door wider giving his access to the house. As she was about to close the door she saw her neighbor Mrs. Wallingsworth near the lake. She must have decided to go for a swim with the kids and take in a little sun. Of course Mrs. Wallingsworth, Shirley, couldn't wait to let Marlo know she noticed her too. She waved to Marlo calling out to her, "Have a nice day." The sound in her voice was most insinuating.   "You know that grapevine we were talking about earlier?" She asked Matt as she closed the door. He nodded his head yes as she showed him into the kitchen. "Well I think it's about to ripen. I'm sorry Matt but Mrs. Wallingsworth was at the lake and saw you coming in here. Now everyone is going to start talking."   He smiled at her, "Let me worry about what they have to say and if it's something I don't like I'll take care of it. Of course, if you hear something you don't like just let me know and I'll take care of that too." Marlo laugh as she got each of them a cup of coffee and offered to make him some breakfast. He was more than happy to give her a hand so together they whipped up breakfast sausage, eggs, and toast to go with that coffee.   While Matt was having breakfast he took in surroundings. He liked what she had done with the place. His Aunt had always had the place so frilly but not Marlo. She gave it a homey touch but yet it wasn't overly feminine. He liked it. To him it was a place a man or a woman could call home and he let her know. "I feel a home should be some place you could feel comfortable in. Not some place where you have to walk on egg shells and be afraid you are going to mess things up or knock something out of place."   "We should get going. It's getting late and we told the ladies we would give them a call early if we found anything." Matt followed Marlo out of her house and past Mrs. Wallingsworth and her family. Matt tipped his hat in respect as he past her and took hold of Marlo's arm. "You're horrible you know. Just give her more to report." She couldn't help but laugh as she and Matt headed out towards the treed area just off the lake.   As they entered the area where they found the girls the night before Maria stopped and searched. Looking around as if she was expecting to see someone there. Although she didn't she felt as though there was someone or something there. The same feeling she gets when she sees her Native American riding high on his horse. She feels him before she sees him. She didn't say anything to Matt. As a matter of fact he just followed her quietly. He seemed to be watching her close. Maybe he thought she was off her rocker and he wanted to make sure he knew exactly what she was doing at all times, Marlo wasn't sure as she continued up the path. "I thought maybe we should check out the top of the cliff first." Matt didn't answer he just followed her.   TO BE CONTINUED...........

      As Marlo sat on her porch she thought she heard a cry coming from some where near the lake. It wasn't the sound of someone crying exactly. Marlo thought she heard someone calling out for help. As she got up from her seat on the porch she scanned the area around the lake. She saw nothing but she could hear the call for help coming in clear. As she started off the porch a car approached. To her surprise it was the third grade teacher Matt Hamilton. As the car came to a halt and he got out she stood there stunned at first.  "Matt, hi! How are you?" Marlo stepped forward and offered her hand in welcome but then she heard the scream. She jumped at the sound of the shrill. Her eyes opened wide as both she and Matt headed towards the sound. "Did you hear that too or was  it my imagination?"  "No, I heard it! Someone needs help!" She ran as fast as she could hoping she would get there in time with Matt close behind her. There was a group of trees that bordered the lake it seemed like the screaming was coming from inside that area. It was close to dark so there wouldn't be much visibility in there. Marlo and Matt followed the sound of the screaming calling out to the person as they got closer. To their surprise they found two young ladies huddled under a tree. They looked as though they had been scared out of their heads.  Marlo recognized both girls. "Betty, Maureen, what are you girls doing here? I know you mother told you to stay away from the lake unless you let me know you were here." She put her arm around Betty while Matt helped with Maureen. Both girls were shaking so bad it was hard for them to talk. "Shhh. Relax. Don't talk now we'll go to the house. We can talk better there." As Matt helped Maureen out of the wooded area and Marlo helped Betty, Marlo could feel the presence of someone or something else there. She turned her head slowly to look around and so as not to scare Betty any more. Her eyes scanned the area around where the girls were found but there was nothing there. As she searched the area off to the left of the opening they were headed for she saw her standing there. A pale image of the same woman she had seen last summer but some how she seemed weaker. Marlo didn't say anything but Betty saw where her eyes were looking.  "You see her, don't you?" Betty was shaking so bad Marlo didn't want to scare her anymore. She didn't say a word as she helped Betty to the clearing and the  four of them headed for the house.   Once they were on the porch the girls started to cry. Marlo went in the house to call their parents to tell them she would take them home but both mothers said they would come for the girls themselves. The girls were both fifteen years old and cold find their own way home any other night but under the circumstances Marlo thought it was best someone take the home. Marlo returned to the porch with iced tea for the four of them. "I thought you girls could use a drink before you tell me what happened out there." The girls didn't say a word as they took their glasses and started sipping the tea.  Betty was the first one to talk, "We were just walking through the pass there to get to the lake. We thought we would come and pay you a surprise visit."  "I appreciate that girls and it was a surprise," she smiled down a them, "but what did your parents tell you about taking that pass at night. It could be dangerous in there."   Matt was sitting next to Maureen trying to figure all of this out. "What happened? Who scared you like that?" Matt asked.  "Ask her she knows." Betty nodded her head towards Marlo.  "Betty I have no idea what you are talking about. Right now you aren't making much sense here." She didn't want to stand there and tell these girls she had seen some vision standing by the trees until she could investigate it further. There was something there that she was sure of but why and what was a different story.  "You had to see her standing there just near the clearing as we were leaving." Betty looked at Marlo searching for some kind of assurance she wasn't losing her mind.  "I'm not sure what I saw. There was a shadow but I didn't get a clear look because it was getting too dark in there. Betty maybe it was someone cutting through the woods the same as you two girls. Someone you might have scared off when you screamed like that."  The girls were shaking their heads no. "That's not what happened." Matt told them to take their time and tell them exactly what happened. "Well Mr. Hamilton, we were walking along the pass when we thought we saw someone running. It seemed like she was being chased so we  climbed up to the top of the pass to see if we could get a better look. That's when we saw her." Maureen's voice was trembling again so Betty took over telling the story, "She was running along the pass to the top of the cliff. We could see two men chasing her but as she got to the top of the cliff they just seemed to reach out and push her over. We hid behind a tree so they didn't see us but as we looked up at the cliff they just disappeared, vanished."   "What do you mean vanished?" You could see Matt was confused.  "You know the stories about the lake being haunted it must have been the spirits we saw because after that we ran down to the bottom of the cliff where you found us. We want to see if the girl was for real or not. When we got there the body was gone. At first we were stunned but as we were about to head for the clearing she appeared again. Her arms were stretched out towards us. She was asking for our help but we panicked and screamed. I think we scared her as much as she scared us." Betty wiped the tears from her eyes. "I never believed the stories but after tonight," she didn't finish her sentence because she didn't have to. Marlo put her arm around Betty's shoulder giving her a gentle hug.   "You girls know you are welcome here whenever you want to come but please do not go through the pass again. I don't know what you saw or didn't see tonight but in the morning I will go in there and check things out. In the mean time stay out of there at night."  "You don't have to worry about us from now on we'll never take that path again at night. I don't know if I'll ever take it during the day either." Maureen was saying as the girls mothers pulled up with Maureen's mother driving. They got out of the car and came to the girls fussing over them. The girls repeated their stories then their mothers did the expected scolding of them not being allowed on the path at night.  "Look these girls have had a tough day. Why don't you take them home and in the morning Miss Ventura and I are going to go over everything along the path and see what we can come up with. If we find anything we will give you a call." The mothers thanked Matt in unison as they put the girls in the car and drove off.  Once they were gone Matt joined Marlo back on the porch. "What do you think of their story? Sounds really far fetched don't you think?" Marlo just looked at him. "Oh come on you don't believe that do you. You can't possibly believe there is something or someone living out there, around the lake." He moved his arm motioning towards the lake.  "I don't know what to think but I do know what I saw and I do know I saw her before and it's always at night and she always seems in distress. So do I know for sure if the girls saw her running from some men? No, I don't. Do I know for sure she doesn't live nearby? No, I don' t know that either. What I do know is I saw her again tonight and she doesn't look like any real person I know so I intend to find out all I can about her."  Matt looked down at the hat he had been holding in his hand. He really didn't know what to say to her. "Look I don't want to argue this point out with you. I have heard stories about this place all my life. To be honest with you I couldn't understand what attracted you to it with all the stories and all. I mean I know it's beautiful here but you had to be aware of the stories and know that's why the Barneby's sold it."  He could tell by the look in her face she was surprised to find out that was the reason it went on the market. "Why would that be the reason they sold the house. I mean they owned it all their lives and now all of a sudden that would be the reason they sold the house."  "Marlo this isn't the first time the house has been on the market. The Barneby's moved out of here years ago. After their son had an accident on that very path the girls were on tonight. He lived but his parents couldn't get out of here fast enough. They've been renting it out ever since and it goes on the market at least once every other year with the hope they would find someone to buy it. Someone who would ignore the stories." Marlo raised her eyebrows and grinned. She didn't say a word it was as if Matt could read her mind, "Ted Barneby's story matches the girls exactly except he followed them up on the cliff and fell off. He was lucky he survived and he swears she helped him. The woman the girls saw tonight."  "How do you know so much about the Barneby's?"  Matt smiled slightly as he said, "This is a small town Marlo and every body knows every body. Ted Barneby is my cousin. My father always claimed my cousin was a little shy of a full deck but I know Ted. He's a very intelligent man with a bright future but to be honest with you he is terrified of things that go bump in the night and he admits it." He paused for a second, "Ted never talked to me about what happened that day but if we find something then maybe, just maybe, he'll talk to us and we can put an end to this." With that he put his hat back on his head putting his fingers to the brim and nodding his head to Marlo he said, "I'll see you in the morning Marlo so we can check this out together." As he headed for his car he turned and said to her, "By the way I stopped by to see if you'd like to get an ice cream or something. Maybe we can do that another time." He smiled at her as he got into his car, waving as he pulled off.

      I haven't written any personal thoughts lately because I've been working on my writing and trying to get my stories ready for a publisher but I feel I need to write down some things.  Only a short month ago I thought I was going to have a baby. I had mixed emotions, of course, because at my age who wants to start over again. However, I went to the doctor to find out and things didn't go exactly the way I had hoped. When I went to his office for my examination he too thought there was a good chance I was going to have a baby. The ultrasound, he thought, looked like the start of a pregnancy however, the blood test proved differently. The following week I was off to have a few test done. One was a more indebted unltrasound the other a momography and ultrasound of my breast. Both tests held a little surprise. My monography showed an abnormality in my left breast believed to be non cancer. But now I have to go to still another doctor to have a biopsy done on Tuesday. I am not in the least bit nervous about having cancer because I believe it is not there at this time, at least not in my breast. I was also told I have to go for a D&C so he can do another biopsy of my uterus because there is a slight thickening of the uterine wall which is why he believed I could be pregnant.  Here's where I have to admit I am a little scared. I lost my mother to cancer almost eleven years ago. These eleven years I have lived a life where I felt the loss every day and I don't want my children to ever feel that loss because I didn't take care of myself. If God chooses to take me home there is nothing I can do to stop it but if it is because I do not do what ever is necessary to survive then I am depriving my children and my husband of me. I don't ever want to do that. I love them all too much.  My mother had uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer a long time ago and she beet it. After ten years she was told she had lung cancer and lost the battle. Of course lung cancer has nothing to do with her first cancer but I don't have to wonder how she got it because she was a heavy smoker. I wish I could explain to smokers just how much they hurt their families by not taking care of themselves. Even though I was 38 years oldwhen my mother died I feel the loss every day. My age didn't make it any easier and the fact that my children were so young hurt because they had to grow up without their Grandmother who should have been here a long time. She should have been able to grow old with her husband and that didn't happen because this damn disease. I guess my biggest fear in life is cancer. I am afraid of it. I am terrified I will die here, in this very house I grew up in, never having my first book published, never buying my farm, never seeing my Grandchildren grow up. I don't want that. I want to be here a long time and I am sorry this is such a morbid entry but I have been keeping so much inside me since I found out I may have a problem because I don't know how to express myself verbablly. I write it better, I always did.  This month I am going to be 49 years old. My mother had her first case of cancer when she was just 47 years old. My very good friend just fought a year long battle with breast cancer at only 39 years old and I am happy, thrilled, to say she is doing great when the doctors were terrified she may not do so well since she was so far gone. I lost numerous family members and friends to this horrible disease so yes I am afraid of it. I am terrified I am going to be another one it claims before I have a chance to live my life to it's fullest. Life means so much to me and I do, at times, get frustrated because I am still in the same house I grew up in and my father is still here with me in this house and believe it or not he's still telling me what to do and not to do. At times I want that to stop but then I think about it and I am thankful I have still have him to tell me what to do or not to do. He means so much to me and having to tell him I have to go for a biopsy was one of the hardest things for me to do because I don't want him to worry. He's 78 years old with Parkinson disease. He doesn't need to worry about me but I am a parent too so I know even though he doesn't need he is going to even when I am not facing a biopsy because he is my father and that's what parents do, they care, they worry.  I haven't been able to cry in front of my family because I don't want them to know how upset I really am. I don't want them to know how scared I am so I tell them and my friends it's nothing to worry about and it's probably not but in the back of my mind it sits there that maybe, just maybe mind you, there is something to worry about. I've already made up my mind about treatment or whatever because I have had years of those I love go through this and I know what I would want for me. I made up my mind long before I was told to go for a biopsy because I figure it was something I needed to come to terms with just in case I ever had to confront cancer and I believe the best way to do that is to hit it head on.  Where we live there is so much of this disease and so many die from it but no one has done a study as to why, at least not as far as I know, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know New Jersey is contaminated with this disease because of things like the industrial revolution when they didn't know the dangers of dumping all that garbage into our water and how it was going to pollute not only the water supply but the air we breath and the soil we walk on and plant our foods. I sometimes wonder if it was all worth it. Yes we are a country that has advanced and continues to but at what risk. New Jersey and New York are considered the best places for jobs because of the pay but you know I don't think it should cost me my life or anyone else theirs because there is money to be made out here. Perhaps someone should do a study of the air we breath and how to clean it up as well as the water or the land instead of worrying whether or not gays have a right to be married and fighting to stop it.  Lately I've been feeling a little lost inside myself because I am scared and I am mad because too many look the other way. My being mad isn't a new feeling because I may or may not have a problem. My being mad started even before my mother died. I lost one of the first people I ever loved in life to lung cancer when I was only five years. That person was my paternal Grandfather. I love him so much I can still remember him. He was a big man and I couldn't believe anything could ever take him away from us. Not my Pop! But this disease knows no boundaries and it's not getting any better in Jersey. We need to start thinking about our children and get them out of here. I have asked my children to please think about moving from here as soon as they can. I am begging them not to raise my Grandchildren in a disease infested state. Yes infested and if you don't believe me take a walk on the cancer floor of any hospital in this state. Talk to the family members and friends of these poor people fighting for their lives and share in the joys of those who have managed to escape death but have to hold their breath for the next five years if not more. There was a slogan Jersey used to use and is said "New Jersey and you .... Perfect together." I don't think there is anything perfect in this state when you could smell the pollution as you drive through the park in the town where I grew up. It's so bad it burns my nose but nothing is being done about it. What about the garbage floating up on the shores. My daughter was down the shore with my niece and the garbage that was in the ocean made her sick. Now we aren't talking the bay we are talking an area like Seaside where there are a lot of people in the water every day. A few years ago my ex husband took my children with his wife, for the day to the lake. While they were there the garbage that was floating in the lake was a disgrace but you have to blame the people of this state too because they don't know what it's like to have things nice and clean so they live in filth, they play in filth, and they dumped even their baby diapers in the water. My son got sick with a virus that lasted for months and there was no treatment, the virus had to take it's course. So you see this state needs help and the people who live here need to open their eyes. They need to fight for their state to improve it, to clean it up. The powers that be need to hear us but the clean up has to be more than picking up garbage. It has to go out to the industries of this state and they have to be made to clean up the mess they have made of our air, water, and soil. They have to be held responsible and it should not be a public official who over sees it but the entire community where the clean up is taking place. I don't know how to do it but the offenders should be made to report the community they are infecting and not to someone who will take a kick back to keep their mouth shut. I'm not saying all elected officials are crooked but there are more that are then not.  I look around this state, hell around the area I grew up, and I can't believe how it has been allowed to deterrorate. How much it has changed in the past ten years, 5 years, and not for the better. People are dying because they can't breath the air, drink the water, or eat the food grown in some parts of this state because the ground is just as sick. The cancer isn't just in the people it is in the environment and it is going to take more than a walk in the park to get it cleaned up and help those we love. If I find out I am cancer free I will thank God for that but it still doesn't change things. This is a beautiful country and we are letting it get trashed. We need to figure out what to do to make it well, help it and the people in it heal. One thing we need to realize is drugs that are working on cancer patients in Europe are developed here and allowed to be used there while we do our testing over and over again and take a good 15 years to get it approved to use here. Sad isn't it. We are supposed to be so advanced but we can't help those who live here survive diseases like cancer and aides but in Europe they take the drugs we are working on here and give it a shot because it's better than not trying anything at all or just using whatever we have even though we know it won't work. My God we are so far behind the times all because we are afraid of the insurance companies who will refuse to pay for the treatment that may or may not save my life or the life of someone I love or you love.  I wish I could say I have the answers on how to clean up this state and make life healthier for those who live here and in making it healthier making it happier, but I don't. I wish I had the answers for a cure to this disease but again I don't so all I really did here is vent a little because I'm scared maybe a little more than I care to admit but I promise you if I figure out how to get someone to listen to me and I get more voices willing to take a stand and demand their environment is cleaned up then I will let you know. I will not stop looking for the answers because I think the people are worth it. Thanks for listening to me. I'm sorry I've been so long winded. I promise I will add to my story Spirit Wolf this weekend. Thank you all for listening to me and for coming back to my page. If you like to help fight and find a way to clean up the environment let me know, sign my page. Maybe together we can figure out why the insurance companies have such a hold over our government that they have the final say in how we get medical treatment or don't get it. Sign my page and let's see what we can get started.

      Since there was no history written about Sleeping Wolf from what they could find they decided to look into legends of the area and see if they could find anything about a someone called Sleeping Wolf. To their surprise they found what they were looking for. Sleeping Wolf was a brave warrior who fought in many battles. He was a man who loved his people and fought hard for them to keep their land, their rights. Most of these battles were fought against other Native American Nations driving them from the land occupied by the Ojibwa. His people lived in an area until the weather or the food conditions caused them to move on. During the warmer months only twelve to thirty lived in a camp but during the winter months, when times were harder, they ranged from 300 to 400 in a camp. The Ojibwa were a strong force even though they weren’t as well known as other tribes. They stood their ground and forced others to leave them be and get out of their territory. The Ojibwa tribes spread out over a large area yet they never formed one tribe however, they were banned together. Some of them grew their own vegetables while other Ojibwa gathered wild fruits, vegetables, and rice. They often hunted for buffalo, antelope, or what ever was available to them, as well as fishing. Quite often they traded food between the tribes in order to help each other survive the hard times. Sleeping Wolf was a warrior and a hunter who took care of his people. His love for his wife was strong and often they went off on their own to have some time rediscovering one another after he had been away on a hunting party or, at times, a war party. The legend said he had wanted to have peace with the white man in order to bring peace to his people. It tells of how most of the battles Sleeping Wolf fought were against other Native American Nations but he did as his elders had instructed and protected his people from losing the land they loved just as the thousands of other Native Americans had done before him and would do after him. Sleeping Wolf had gone with a hunting party for about a week when he returned to camp injured. The party had been attacked by a neighboring tribe while they were hunting for food. Most of the men Sleeping Wolf had gone off with returned with him alive but he was injured while helping one of his warriors. They carried him back to camp where he was fixed up and able to get some rest. After a few days he was feeling like himself again so his wife, Nuetee, took it upon herself to set up a camp for the two of them near the lake they so loved. It was to be a place for him to rest and get well and a time for them to enjoy and be together while he healed. They spent time doing nothing and yet doing so much. Nuetee would often go off into the wooded area just beyond the lake and look for food while Sleeping Wolf would fish or just go for a ride on his horse. He always cautioned her to be careful and to watch out in case there were any others in the area. She wasn’t afraid because she had him with her to protect her and together they had a friend who watched over them. Their friend was a wolf named Tette, who stayed with Nuetee in camp when ever Sleeping Wolf was off fighting. Often when he went hunting he took his friend along with him. About the fourth day of their journey they both new they couldn’t stay away much longer. There was a lot of tension growing in the camp about the neighboring tribe and their desire to take the land from them. The Tribal Chief’s were planning to take a stand and see to it that no one took another piece of their land without permission. It was the land of the Ojibwa as far as they were concerned and the only thing the other tribes as well as the white man brought to it was destruction, illness, and death. This they wanted no part of. Keeping their people safe where they belonged was what concerned them. So Sleeping Wolf and Nuetee knew they had to return to their village camp for the work that needed to be done. Although she feared for his life she knew he would return to her and she would wait for him. She never let him see the fear she held close to her heart because she was a warrior’s wife and held her head up high, proud of her husband. They left the camp the following morning to return to their village a short distance away and in just a few short days Sleeping Wolf was gone once again. While he was gone Nuetee worked on making a few things for him to wear in the cold months ahead since winter was about to come in once again. The women of the tribe worked on making moccasins, leggings, and fur wraps to keep them warm in the cold weather as well as gathering food such as, wild fruits and rice. It was the third day after Sleeping Wolf had left when Nuetee went off alone, searching for some wild fruit. The War Party was expected back in a couple of days so there was preparations that needed to be complete for the celebration. She left camp early in the morning leaving Tetee behind but never returned. The others looked for her but were unable to find her before night fall. The following morning a few of the females went out again in search of Nuetee. They even looked along the lake where she and Sleeping Wolf loved to go and be alone but there was no sign of Nuetee. After two days Sleeping Wolf returned only to find his wife had not been found. He searched for her but was unable to find her as well. He knew she would never have gone off and not returned unless something had happened to her. In his sorrow he went off, with Tetee close besides him, to the lake and searched day and night with his friend. Just before night fall Tetee picked up the scent and led Sleeping Wolf to the cliff along the path leading from the woods. There the legend says Sleeping Wolf looked down from the cliff and saw the body of his wife lying at the bottom. He let out a blood curdling howl that could be heard back in the village. Others came to help him bring her home but he never stopped searching the lake for those who did her harm. Even when the tribe moved on because the season made the area harder on the them to survive, Sleeping Wolf would return, with his trusted friend Tette, to search. He believed one day who ever did this would return and he would have his revenge but Sleeping Wolf died with out ever knowing what happened to her. The legend says he still searches the lake in search for the ones who killed her while she stays in the woods waiting for him to return preparing for the day when they would be together again. Their love never died and it is believed one day they will return to life form, find each other once again since their love was eternal, to live a long life together till they once again pass on to live the eternal life as one. Marlo let out a sigh as she sat back in her chair in front of the computer, “Boy that’s some love story.” Matt didn’t believe any of this had anything to do with the legend but he did know something happened on that cliff earlier that day and he was sure there was a logical explanation. “What’s wrong Matt? You don’t believe this do you?” “I don’t know what I believe or don’t believe. I have never seen this woman or this warrior walking around the lake but you did call me Sleeping Wolf today and you did say some thing about waiting for me a long time. I don’t know what to think.” He rubbed his hand through his hair, “I’m going to call the girls mothers and tell them we find any one because we didn’t.” He was sure she was going to give him an argument and was surprised when she didn’t, “I think we need to take a ride to see my cousin. Tomorrow is Sunday. What do you say we take a out there tomorrow and see if he’s willing to talk to us.” Marlo nodded her head in agreement. “In the mean time please don’t go out there alone,” he motioned towards the woods. Marlo assured him she would stay close to her house for the rest of the day and yes she would be ready for him to pick her up early the next morning. “You may not be able to go to church in the morning. Is that going to be a problem?” “No, I’ll go to a mass this evening. How did you know I go to church on Sundays?” He smiled at her and winked teasing her. “I take it you go to the same church.” Matt just smiled at her and assured her he wasn’t following her and yes he did go to the same church. He said his goodbyes and headed home giving her time to get herself ready for mass.  To Be Continued....................
