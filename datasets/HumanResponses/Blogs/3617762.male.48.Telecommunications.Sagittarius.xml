      HOW TO USE KEYWORD SUCCESSFULLY FOR SEARCH ENGINES  By emmanuelsar   When it comes to submitting your website to Search Engines, Keyword building is the backbone of your online advertising campaign - These words that will lead the millions of online searchers to you. However, there is more to building keyword lists than just coming up with a few words that describe your product or service offering.  The market presently indicates that generic terms such as  "investment" and "insurance" are highly valued and that  more obscure, but targeted keywords are valued much  less (e.g.: "Atlanta Georgia car insurance"). However,  contrary to what the market is determining, searchers are  becoming savvier and are using more specific keyword  combinations to find what they're looking for. Results  show that 45% of searchers use a combination of  keywords (key phrases), 28% use one keyword, 18%  search by a predefined option (such as browsing through  a directory category) and 9% search by typing in  a question (NPD).  You therefore have two choices when it comes to creating  a keyword list. The first is listing generic keywords in order  to generate the most traffic possible to your site, resulting in  high click-through ratios, but low conversion rates.  The other option is listing targeted keywords that will drive  targeted traffic to your site, resulting in traditionally lower  click-through rates, but higher conversion ratios ratios (e.g.: "Atlanta Georgia car insurance").  For example, if you are selling insurance services in Atlanta, Georgia and are only capable of delivering your services there, then you may not want to list the generic keyword phrase "car insurance". You would receive a high volume of click-throughs, but from geographic places you would not logistically be able to supply. This is a waste of your advertising money. +The number of keywords that you list on a search engine is also crucial to your online success.  Each additional keyword and keyword phrase you suggest will increase your site's chances of being found. Think of it as, not only placing as many hooks as possible in the lake,but also making sure they are of the right type to attract the clients you want.  ==> Powerful Creatives  Almost as important as the keywords are the creatives that support them. In the search industry, creatives refer to the titles and descriptions that expand upon the keywords you select. They provide a small glimpse of what your website has to offer. It is important to be as clear as possible for a number of reasons.  First, it is preferable not to use superlatives, caps or exclamation marks in your titles because this reduces the  validity of your offer and is not viewed as a professional listing. Second, it is suggested that the title and the description include the keyword it is associated with -  this is to reinforce that the result is relevant.   It should also expand in as few words as possible what the web  site is offering.  Using the car insurance company as an example, the title should have the following elements: "Company ABC car insurance for residents in Atlanta, Georgia". The description,as an expansion of the title, should have the following elements:   "Reputable car insurance solutions that are affordable and offer excellent coverage". Using this method of advertising on search engines, you are sure to attract your target market to your site, (from a purely geographic  demographic).  ==> Relevant URL's:   In addition to using specific and relevant titles and  descriptions, the URL that you submit to the search  engine must also be targeted. Ideally, the user should  go to the exact page that they are looking for on the  first click.  For example, if the user is searching for a specific type of insurance among your assortment of solutions, the submitted destination URL should take them directly to the page describing the solution in question. Internet  searchers have low patience levels, and, if they cannot immediately find what they are looking for on your site, they will give up and move on to the next result on the list.  ==> Added Benefits of Advertising Online: Tracking your ROI  You can analyse down to the penny your increase in sales through keyword advertising by tracking the conversion  rates (sales generated from clicks) for each ad money that you spend.   You only have to create a specific URL per  initiative, pointing to your website so that you can track which marketing effort the click is coming from.   You will then be able to monitor someone clicking on your advertisement, going to your site and converting into a sale.  This information will notify you which keywords, creatives  and marketing efforts are producing an acceptable ROI and  which efforts are not.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Do you want to use Keyword for your website submission?

      Regulation E protects consumers when they are hit by electronic financial fraud  • What's covered  • Consumer liability  • What consumers should do  • What banks are required to do  • For more information        Consumers have well-defined rights with respect to fraudulent electronic transfers, and should generally be able to obtain refunds with little hassle. The rights are spelled out in what's known as "Reg-E," or the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation E. The Fed was authorized to draw up the regulation by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1979. The regulation covers all manner of transfers into and out of bank accounts outside of paper checks, including the use of debit cards. It does not cover credit card transactions.      What's covered Any transfer initiated through an "electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit an account." These include point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine transfers, direct deposits or withdrawals of funds, transfers initiated by telephone, and transfers resulting from debit card transactions, whether or not initiated through an electronic terminal.   Consumer liability When a debit card or other "acccess device" is lost, such as an online banking password, consumer liability is capped at $50 for those who notify banks within two business days. Consumers who notify the bank within 60 days have their liability capped at $500. After 60 days, if the consumer doesn't inform the bank, any charges which occur become the consumers' responsibility. If no access device is lost, and fraudulent charges mysteriously appear on a consumer's account, the liability clock begins when the bank notifies its customer of the activity, usually through regular monthly statements.       What consumers should do The quicker the bank is notified, the better. Reg-E says consumers can notify banks in person, by telephone, or in writing -- the notice is considered given, even if bank employees don't acknowledge receipt of it. A certified letter is probably the best bet; that way you have a copy in case the bank challenges you on the issue of timely notification.      What banks are required to do Banks must investigate disputed charges within 10 days, and report results to the consumer within three days. Errors must be fixed within one day. If the investigation cannot be completed within 10 days, banks must issue a provisional credit to the consumer for the disputed amount, less $50.      When a debit card or other "acccess device" is lost, such as an online banking password, consumer liability is capped at $50 for those who notify banks within two business days. Consumers who notify the bank within 60 days have their liability capped at $500. After 60 days, if the consumer doesn't inform the bank, any charges which occur become the consumers' responsibility. If no access device is lost, and fraudulent charges mysteriously appear on a consumer's account, the liability clock begins when the bank notifies its customer of the activity, usually through regular monthly statements.
