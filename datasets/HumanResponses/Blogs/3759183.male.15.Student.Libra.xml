             Modern consumer society regularly throw away rubbish . However , a lot of waste can be recycled . Metal , glass , paper , waste food and many more can actually be collected before being recycled and used again . These things could be recycled over and over again .         Why do we need to recycle ? We need to recycle because we could help conserve enrgy needed to make new products . By recycling , we conserved lots of energy . We could also reduce rubbish which are to be burnt or dumped . In this case , we could help reduce the amount of rubbish dumps in the country .         Before being recycled , rubbish were collected and taken to processing plants before being sorted out into glass , aluminium and paper . Waste glass were broken up first before being sent to the recycling plant to be made into new glass . Empty cans and used aluminium were sent to recycling plants to be melted down and made into new cans . As for used papers , they were broken down in chemical bath and bletched to remove ink in the recycling plant before being made into waste paper .         By recycling , we could help to protect mother nature . It is important to recycle as it can help both living and non-living things .  -------------------------------EnDz-------------------------------  Erm .. THis is actually my school examination essay .. I got 28/30 ..! hehe .. but i haven't recorrect those mistakes .. LeavE it oUT to U la !! GO FinD THose MIsTakEs .!

      Our Emotional lives and our spiritual lives have different dynamics . The ups and downs of our emotional lives depends a great deal on our past or present surroundings . We are happy , sad , angry , bored , excited , depressed , loving , caring , hateful or vengeful because of what happened long ago or what is happening now .  THe ups and down of our spiritual lives depend on our obedience - that is , our attentive listening - to the movements of the Spirit of God within us . Without this listening our spiritual live eventually becomes subject to the wind-swept waces of our emotions .

      Ever since  September 11th , I've been arguing that religion had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. I've been pointing out that the Qur'an specifically forbids the killing of innocents in war, the killing of other Muslims even by accident (there were Muslims in the World Trade Center), and even forbids suicide. Islam does not condone this sort of thing, it condemns it in at least three different ways, if not more. Thus, I asserted that the people who committed this act were not acting in the service of any god recognized by any religion.  I was wrong.  They claimed that the events of September 11th were God's punishment for America's sins. This is precisely what many fundamentalist terrorists are reported to believe: that they are executing Allah's will in punishing America. Of course, they differ on which sins are being punished, Falwell blaming those who condone paganism, feminism, homosexuality, abortion, the ACLU, and the People for the American Way. But the central message is the same.  Alas, all the news in the world will sometimes fail to fully impact us until some little event in our own lives connects with it. Thus, I did not realize the significance of Falwell's comments on the 13th, and how they demonstrated the falsity of my own opinions since the 11th, until I encountered a woman on the 21st who helped me see what was wrong with my thinking.  I was helping staff the SCSU Pagan Alliance's table in Atwood, as I do every pagan holiday (the Autumnal Equinox in this case), when a woman stopped by the booth to talk to us. She started by "asking" us (and I quote "asking" since it later became obvious that she had already made up her mind and wasn't going to listen to any answer we provided) if we worship Satan. We don't, of course, and we told her so, and explained a bit about our various religions. She then professed her belief that the attack on the World Trade Center was caused by Satanists, and expressed her complete surprise that we would dare set up a display in Atwood so soon after that attack. I don't recall what we said, if anything -- we were all rather stunned by this. She concluded by expressing how deeply offended she was by our display and our very presence before storming off.  At the time, we laughed it off. What else could we do? But intolerance is a very serious matter, whether it be religious, racial, ethnic, sexual, or any other kind. And intolerance is one of the central tenets of the religion followed by this woman, by Falwell and Robertson, and even by the terrorists who attacked America. For you see, it finally dawned on me what I should have realized eight days before, in light of the disturbing echo between the words of Falwell and the words of radical terrorists: these people all worship the same God and follow the same religion!  The religion in question is called Fundamentalism. In the past, I've mistakenly believed that Christian Fundamentalists were a type of Christian, and that Islamic Fundamentalists were a type of Muslim, etc. But clearly, I was wrong. As I pointed out in the beginning, the terrorists were acting in ways directly contrary to the Qur'an. Could they even properly be considered Muslims? I don't see how, as they've rejected the very principles of Islam.  In fact, Fundamentalism is its own religion, that just happens to have denominations that insidiously associate themselves with other religions. An Islamic Fundamentalist is not a Muslim, he or she is a Fundamentalist who takes on the trappings of Islam. Likewise, a Christian Fundamentalist isn't a Christian, just a Fundamentalist of a different sort. And regardless of what name each sect calls their god, all Fundamentalists worship the same god: the god of hatred.  I had previously claimed that the attacks of September 11th were inconsistent with any religion in the service of any god, but they were not. They were fine examples of Fundamentalism in the service of hatred. Hatred is powerful, and also deceptive. Many people who worship Hatred are deceived into thinking they worship a different god, the god of love or of justice or of all good things, but if they really look at themselves, their own actions and attitudes that their religion inspires, they should be able to see through the deception. In the coming weeks, months, and years, I hope all of us, religious or not, can learn to stop and examine ourselves, and recognize when hatred is coloring our thoughts, and how to deal with it and not be deceived by it.  As for the woman who visited our display, she parted by wishing that God find us and help us. The gods have never abandoned me, despite my having abandoned them for many years, but I appreciate her thought, and I return it. Whoever you are, may you someday return to the God you believe in. He is, according to all the good Christians I know, a god of love and peace, and if you truly listen to him, he can help you in the struggle against hatred.  Bright Blessings. &nbsp; AnoTher ArTicLe ! I GonNa LoVe ThiS maN !!!

      In the second of my series of "   Counterpoint   " articles, in which I attempt to present alternative viewpoints, I would like to explore the issue of environmentalism and it's relation to paganism.  First of all, is there a relation? It would seem that for people of a predominantly earth-centered spirituality, there would be. It certainly seems to be assumed by many that if you're a pagan, you must love the earth, and therefore be supportive of efforts to protect her. Some would go as far as to say that if you don't, you aren't really pagan at all.  But does loving and protecting the earth necessarily imply support for environmentalism?  I guess that depends on what exactly you think the earth needs protection from. Like many pagans, I believe in Gaia, the planetary-scale organism of which we are all a part. I consider the well-being of Gaia to be of extreme importance. It is precisely because of this that I frequently find myself opposed to the actions and attitudes of most environmentalists. I frequently find it difficult to believe how disconnected they must feel from Gaia. I have a hard time comprehending how they can hate such large and important parts of her. And I'm utterly aghast at how often they attempt to interfere with her continued natural growth and evolution.  The essential anti-Gaia strain that I see running through much environmentalist thought centers around the absurd distinction between "natural" and "artificial". If you truly understand Gaia, then you know that you and every other living thing on the planet is a part of her. We are all Gaia's children. We are all natural. Thus, to consider a beehive natural but a skyscraper any less so is patently absurd.  I get tired of hearing how "modern people living in cities have lost touch with the natural world." We all live in the natural world, folks! You can't claim to believe in Gaia while denying that someone living in Manhattan is as in touch with nature as someone living in an old-growth forest in some remote part of Alaska. The person in Manhattan is perhaps out of touch with a certain type of natural environment, but the person in Alaska is equally out of touch with a different type of natural environment. Both environments are the result of the actions of particular species and wouldn't be there without them. Why would you consider the terrain that's a result of one species more or less natural than the terrain that's the result of another? You can't, if you're sincere in your Gaian beliefs.  You see, if you recognize the beauty in Gaia, you will see it in all her parts. And that includes her human parts. Hate humanity and its creations, and you hate Gaia herself. You also doubt her wisdom. Would she have given birth to clever evolved tool-users without reason? What reason do you have to think our actions are anything other than exactly what is required?  You point to endangered species and decry extinctions. And yet, we know from Gaia's past that these are sometimes required. None of the wondrous variety of life you see today would be here if, several thousand million years ago, a certain species had not evolved. This species did not think much of other species. It produced a gas that was lethally poisonous to the other 99% of life on the planet, and it produced it in such massive quantities that before long, this noxious gas became a major component of the atmosphere. As you would expect, this nearly wiped out all life on earth. Only those few species tolerant to this new gas, oxygen, were able to survive. And yet this was necessary to create the kind of atmosphere that complex and active life forms like us require.  Many more mass extinctions would follow over the eons, each time clearing away a great deal of old, moribund species that hadn't changed in millions of years, clearing the way for newer, more advanced, and more innovative species. It seems to happen on a fairly regular basis, every thirty million years, give or take. Perhaps this is because it needs to happen on a fairly regular basis.  The fact of the matter is, Gaia's environment changes all the time. It's supposed to. Species are supposed to adapt to the changing environment, or die off if they can't. This is the way of things, the way it has always been. Species have gone extinct on a daily basis for eons. Let them go in peace!  It's not that trying to save endangered species is wasted effort. It's rather that to do so is to try and stop a process that is vital for Gaia's continued growth! If we try hard to preserve Gaia as she is today, to prevent the natural environment from changing, habitats from disappearing, and so on, I have no doubt that we can succeed in doing so. But as someone who loves Gaia, I must oppose this! We must not stunt Gaia's growth in this manner! Who knows what wonders she has in store, if only we let her continue to grow? Given the chance, in the wake of massive environmental change, she has never failed to recover. In fact, she has always succeeded in not only recovering but in producing things even more wonderful than before. Do you have so little faith in her that you think she won't do it again, that she must be protected from anything ever changing again?  Seventy million years ago, the world was far more lush than it is today. The species may have been less advanced by our standards, but they were certainly plentiful. Of course, in those days, Gaia had no ice caps, and tropical climes ranged north of the Arctic Circle. This, of course, was because Gaia's air contained far more carbon dioxide than it does today. It was a greenhouse heaven for her flora, and the fauna thrived off this bounty. Given that, from a Gaian perspective, is global warming a bad thing? The Ice Ages have been good for Gaia in that they promoted extinction and evolution, including the evolution of some particular precocious primates, but perhaps the time has come to dispense with the ice caps and return to the days of warmth.  Hundreds of millions of years ago, certain types of seaweed evolved that started spreading iodine in the atmosphere, where it would settle on continents. It had no use at the time, but it laid the groundwork for the biochemistry of future land animals. We would all quickly sicken without it. Today, we spread plastics in landfills that won't degrade quickly, if at all. But these chemicals may be vital to some future species. Who is to say we aren't laying the groundwork for some future biochemistry?  You see, the problem with most environmentalists is that they don't know the answer to that question, but they're so concerned with doing something that they do things without any clue of whether it's the right thing or not. They engage in knee-jerk responses to anything that might in any way change the world for fear that it may be a change for the worse. But the world must change if Gaia is to grow! Change is vital for her continued well-being!  Environmentalists need to temper their concern with careful consideration. Then they can begin to carefully choose what issues are worth fighting for and what ones are not only wasted effort, but discredit their cause. They will be more effective in achieving their goals if they learn to be reasonable as well as passionate.  But as long as environmentalists remain enemies to any change to the natural world, they remain enemies to Gaia, and all those who love her must oppose them. I am pagan, and I love Gaia too much not to be extremely critical of environmentalism.&nbsp;   I GoT iT fROm SomE sOrt Of WeBsiTE ..! reAd iT and fEels quick interestinG ..!  EnJoY iT ..!!
