      Cyndi is gone for a week in the Bahamas so I'm doing her job as well as mine. The dynamics of the office are a lot different without her around and while it's stressful in someways, it's better in others. I am doing the work she does, but doing it right and trying (albeit only moderately successfully) to not panic when I have so much on my plate. She's leaving in June for a career change since she just graduated and although I'm looking forward to it, I'm also kind of freaked out about it. That means a new person to train, and I think I'll be the one doing some of the training.   Office politics are also interesting. It seems that everyone has a beef with everyone else on some day during the week. I'm just generally bitchy, though I don't mean to be. I'm bringing my day to day life with me to work and I need to stop doing that. Stress in life needs to be seperate from stress at work. That way it won't compound things. Today I started out with a nasty attitude...but talked with Mary and felt better immediately. Tomorrow there's some sort of meeting at 8:30 for the whole company. It seems that we're having a change in the way that insurance is being taken out of our checks. Pre tax instead of Post tax I think. In other news, there should be raises coming, if what I percieve is correct. Hopefully that's just a boon to me with another raise on top of that for a change in position.   Boring stuff..but it's my life.   Went out to take care of Erik tonight and he read a book to me. That was a wonderful thing to hear. :) I'm so proud of this little boy. He's working so hard at school and is struggling through the desire for independence and the need for his parents. At the tender age of 7 he's already been through so much. I hope to make his life a little easier in the years to come.

      Father's Day 2004. I haven't spoken to my father in 3.5 to 4 years now. My ex Step Father is recovering from a day out at the ballgame yesterday. My current Step Father is with my mom 4 hours away at a family reunion.  On Mother's Day, my mom was out of town. Easter, mom was with my Step Father's Family.   So, seems like it's a crappy set of holidays this year. ERik will be with his father on Christmas. So I'm sure I'll be here in St. Louis instead of with my family. I don't want to be around them any way.   Today is a bitter day. Ugh.   Blogging is entertaining, I guess. I'm going to start writing in here more. I'm going to write about specific things having to do with my family. Maybe this will be the catylist to begin the book I know is there.

      I remember dreaming about sitting in a swing as a very young girl. It was the fall and my father was pushing me back and forth, back and forth. I remember being happy to be with him.   Now, as I sit here at age 26, I feel that I will never have another happy dream about my father. I will no longer have happy memories of him. There aren't too many to remember anyway.   There was a day when I was 4 years old, sitting on the couch and crying as I watched my father take his suitcase and walk out the door of our home. When I was young, I wanted nothing more than his approval and his love and I suppose things haven't changed much in that way. I would still like his approval and love. I'm not going to get it.   This week we exchanged e-mails. They were nasty and hateful. I haven't seen him for years...hadn't spoken to him in over 3 years. He's lived in Arizona since I was seven years old and I have never seen him much.   I sent an e-mail out to everyone on my list and ended up sending it to him. There was a question asking who would be least likely to respond and I put he and my stepmother. A few days later, I recieved a response criticizing me for that comment. I was speaking nothing but the truth and thought it would be glossed over. Apparently emotions are raw in that household and I struck a nerve.  Over the course of two days, he called me names, told me I was just like my mother ( the biggest insult he can weild) and told me I shirked my responsibilities. He said I was still angry with him about not giving me money at a time when I needed it. If I hadn't been desperate, I never would have asked. He said that he needed to help my step-sister with the purchase of a house and I said as much and said I understood. He wrote back stating that she had never needed their help and took nothing from them, so I should leave her the hell out of it. Caught in a lie apparently. I left my boyfriend and left him with custody of our son because I couldn't have handled being a single parent. My son would not have been in a good environment. My ex and I both new that and instead of going through the courts for a nasty battle, I conceded and left my son with him. My father did the same when he left my mother and apparently holds anger and guilt over that situation. He acts as though it was an easy decision for me. Acts as though I just left and went galavanting off on a childless vacation. In reality, I left and started to rebuild my life and myself.   Now my son's father and I are closer than ever and we all have a wonderful relationship. Given the circumstances, that's the best thing that could have come out of everything.   Anyhow, nasty things said by both sides.   I decided to have no further contact with him last week. Ever. Maybe when I'm older that will change. But for now, he and I are both too stubborn to apologize. He hasn't been a father to me for years and I can't say that anything much has changed. Only the reality that he's the man I had always heard about and had always hoped everyone was wrong about. I still can't believe he acted in the way he did.   He attacked my aunt as well. My closest friend and ally in the family. Apparently he thinks I've been poisoned against him. The two of them have had a fairly long standing feud. He said to me that family is the most important thing to him. When his parents are pissed at him, his sisters will no longer speak to him and he attacks his only biological child.   I've never seen a father act in this way toward a child.   Now, all of this is my perception. A one-sided arguement, I guess. I will not post e-mails here because they are simply too much to handle at this point. I want to sweep it all under the rug and forget about it. I haven't needed him for years and will continue to get along without him. It's the finality of the decision. I had always hoped he and I could be close. Apparently that's not going to be the case.   Could I have done something different? Probably. But I'm not the parent here. I'm his daughter. I shouldn't have to clamor for the approval of an apparition. If he had wanted a relationship with me for the last few years, if he could have seen past whatever anger he held toward me, if things could have been worked out enough in his head to have a conversation with me....then maybe the situation would have been different.   I have an ex stepfather whom I have called "dad" since I was fairly young. He's the one who was there and continues to be. I have a stepfather now who would take care of me if push came to shove. I have a great family with lots of loving support. It took me until last week to realize what a support network I have. Randy (the bio father) seems to be the only one who doesn't want to be a part of it. He wants to get to know his grandson, that's evident. But he will not get to know my son until he gets to know me.   I've already checked out the legal issues governing grandparental rights and have found out that he doesn't have any rights. He hasn't seen Erik, hasn't contacted him and it's not like he's been seeing him since he was an infant. So, that's that. If they want to take it to court, then so be it. I wouldn't put it past them.   Anyhow, that has been the main part of my week.   Happy Fourth of July to me.
