      My husband played this for me the other night, I about jumped out of my chair, I am sure lots of people have seen this, but I thought I should share. Hope you enjoy.    This is pretty crazy... Check out this email I just received:This is a car advert from somewhere. When they finished filming the adthe people who made it noticed something moving along the side of thecar, like a ghostly white mist.The ad was never put on TV because the unexplained ghostly phenomenonfrightened the production team out of their wits.Watch it and about halfway look and you will see the white mistcrossing in front of the car then following it along the road...Spooky!Turn your sound on, then click link to watch the movie. http://www.stokeyouth.co.uk/Classic_Auto_1.mpeg

       This is all new to me!  I have never done a blog before, but I figured it might be fun.  I have decided to name my blog, Its All About Me, I am sure thats not the most original name for it, but hey, lets face it,  Its all about me right. : )   Being that this is my first blog, I guess I should write a bit about who I am and all that.  My name is Jaime, I am 26 years old, I live in Northern California.  I moved up here from So Cal in 1996 right after I graduated from high school, and as long as I live, I will not move back to So Cal, I don't like it down there, I will go to visit, but won't move back.  All my family and friends live there and I wish I could see them more but my home is here, and you know the old saying,  " Home is where your heart is"  my heart is in Northern California. I was born in Salt Lake City Ut  in July 1978,  and a year after I was born my parents were divorced and I moved to California with my mom.  In 1980 or so, my mom married my stepfather and we moved several times before settling down in Orange Ca, in a small apt that smelled like bug spray because we had nasty roaches, icky!  We lived in the apt for a couple of years, and then I was moved to a group home for abused children, because my stepfather couldn't keep his hands and other things to himself.  After I lived there for a couple of months, I moved to a foster home on a Airforce base in So Cal, my foster family was okay, but I didn't belong there.   After living with my foster family for a few months, I moved in with my grandma in Victorville.  I lived there for about a year, then in 1987 I went to live with my dad in Ut, which was an experience all on its own... I lived with my dad and stepmom until June 1990, then without my father knowing I made plans with my mom to move back to california and have been back in california for a little over 14 years now, I have not been back to even visit any of my family in Ut, the last time I saw my dad was in May of 1997 when I got married.   When I moved back to California my mom and I moved a couple of times before we ended up living with my grandma again in Victorville, I finished high school in Phelan and moved to No Cal.  I originally moved up here to live with my mom who had moved up here the summer before my senior year in high school, but after me being here for 5 months, she decided she wanted to go back to So Cal and was not very happy that I didn't go with her, but she got over it...  In May 1997 I got married, my husband and I had only been together for 6 months.  We have been married for 7 years,  and we have a 6 year old daughter, who is the light of our lives.   I wouldn't trade any second I have with her, because she is so special and I wouldn't be the same without her.  So thats it about me.... Now I guess I will write about other things that are going on with me.
