      Still trying to get my way around this thing. I realise my own age is increasing by the minute as i press the mouse button trying to get to where I want to go but unfortunately not getting to exactly the right page. I wasn't like this before when i was like may be 20 ? Not as computer savvy as before I reckon. Anyway so this will be the first blog and lets see if it will work out.   Went to the Mango sale on the friday during lunch time but went over time. Some girl at the office decided to tell the boss. But the boss is cool he didn't say anything. Just came up to me and ask whether the sale at Mango is good (the boss is a male in case you wonder). Dont know whether that is a warning or just a friendly conversation. But either way, I know who to thrash at the next office party. Okie back to the sale, nothing there really. Just a whole lot of people pushing and shoving each other. A bit like visiting the pasar malam. There were lots of aunties there too. Wonder how they would look like wearing some of the cloths. ew. One would hope they are shoppingn for their daughter and not themselves. Anyway, one particular aunty was pushing and shoving and yelling excuse me excuse me right behind me while i tried to make my way upstair. Felt like telling her to just shut up. Not like I dont want to move, i am just as eager to look for a good sale upstairs. After 5 minutes of getting stuck in the human traffic jam, i managed to move upstairs. The trip upstairs was only 2 minutes, it was a jungle out there. women behaving like animals goinng through rumbles of cloths, elbowing each other. So i decided to join in the fun and be an animal for once, and manage to grab one tank top which costs around 13 bucks.   one thing i dont understand about this sale is that, everytime i visit one, there is bound to be one person who decided to push in line and get in front. Are these people like blind or are they just naturally rude. Anyway i figured ifthey can be rude i can be rude back. so the poor girl who pushed in during the sale got told to bring her bootie back to the end of the line. She didn't look remorseful nor did she look embarrassed. Totally do not understand these people. whatever happen to the courtersy campaign?   Since we are writing on the subject matter of courtesy. I was reading a posting by some female who claims that a lot of Singaporean actually do give out seats to the older people when they get on the train. I can't quite agree with her. I still see a lot of men out there who doesn't give seats to a pregnant lady let alone some poor old lady or man. In fact they would much rather do a 100 meter speed run to take the seat away from you, and spread their leg as wide as possible so you can't sit next to them. So inconsiderate!!!! i can't stand people like that. is it just my bad luck to meet these people?   *sigh* I could go on and on about these people. But the fact is these people are still out there and I can't do anything about it. perhaps it is time I save enough money to get myself a car. Then I am sure there will be other stupid drivers on the road who make life hell for me. well i guess i have to end this blog by saying....If you can't beat them Join them. So the next time you see a girl fighting for a seat, please have some compassion for her coz she has been through a lot. =P   Night!
