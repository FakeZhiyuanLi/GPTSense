      For those of you who are reading, you may find it weird why do I start my story with Chapter 4. I will add in the previous chapters some other time or may be not all all. Anyway, this is supposed to be an account of what happened on 21/8/04.  - E X tremist saved - It was the usual service day. However, there was something special I have to do today, something significant, something that is going to make an impact in the rest of my life. I'll leave the best for the last for now. Two weeks ago before the spookshow, DC and WH promised to go church yesterday. I suppose DC wanted to meet his chem lecturer in my church and WH probably just wanted to accompany DC and it was Niap's birthday on 20/8/04. So, we wanted to bring him out for a surprise and WH made him promise to attend service. Praise the Lord that He arranged a way for him to come. Although, I know there's not much change that is going to change niap yet, but I believe my Lord has done His marvellous work within him and by exposing him to service, God is changing His hardened heart bit by bit. I was so delighted yesterday that my brothers came for service and it was the  FIRST  time during service that I offered 10 dollars. I just felt that God deserved this amount of offering. I didn't know DC's parents are christians and I didn't even know He had christian portraits at home and even a Bible. He was so zealous during service, maybe that was his usual self. Ever so extreme in everything that he do, that's why we called him  'The  E X tremist'. He can take part in e X treme sports for sure. He responded to the altar call for baby christians. Of all the people there, he was the 2nd least likely. Niap was first. I thought he was joking considering his extreme actions but he was serious and held none of his particulars back during consolidation session.I thanked God that he made this decision. Thank You, Lord for saving him and blessing him with the courage to respond to the stirring in his spirit. I was contented that WH was so attentive during service, he described to me how the sermon could be applied to his life. Although there are things holding him back from devoting his entire life to You, God almighty, I pray and believe one day, one day, one fine day, one fine day, he will take up this righteous path. Same applies to Niap too. Lord, I commit these people to Your Hands. Let Your perfect love fill their hearts and sastify the emptiness in their soul. Bless them with the Holy Spirit and guide them each and every step nearer and nearer to their salvation and greater glory. Lord, do Your good work in them and bless them with the wisdom to understand Your Word and open their eyes and let them see the wonderful Glory of God that is all around them. In Jesus' most High, Holy and Sweetest name I pray.  - Frozen wound - Lord, I had sacrificed whatever that is going to be a burden to our relationship. I want to surrender my life to You because I know You care so much for me. I'm willing to do anything, anything for You. I threw away whatever ex-lovers stuff I had in my drawer, not completely cleared though because I couldn't bring so much with me. I'm a psycho, boyfriend(I'm not homo) said as I wanted to dispose all these useless stuff in the church dustbin. Of all the places, the church dustbin.*laugh* Lord, I give You my heart. Guard it well, let me not fall for the devil's trap again. I had disposed of these things. Let Your healing work begin in me. Pour out Your Healing Grace onto me. Let it be a frozen wound no more, but a wound completely healed and without blemish. But Lord, let me remember this experience so that I could share my pain and feelings to other people and let them learn and grow through those difficult times. Lord, I know You love me so much that You hung there and died for me. I don't want anything to hinder our intimate relationship. I just want to worship You alone and not have any other 'gods'(Ps. Tan Hee Guan's sermon). Lord, use Your servant wisely. I commit myself into Your loving hands, conform me to be like Jesus Christ. Fill me with Your compassion, mercy, love, patience, peace, gentleness and wisdom. Let me understand the people around me and bless me with the Holy Spirit to guide me in order to help them. Let me glorify You. In Jesus' most high, precious, holy and sweetest name. And all God's children say? AMEN!!!   For Your Love is higher than the heavens,   deeper than the sea,   all I want is You in my Life.(How could I live without You)

      But  Jesus  came to open my ears to another voice that says, ‘I am your  God , I have moulded you with My own hands, and I love what I have made.  I love you with a love that has no limits, because I love you as I am loved.  Do not run away from Me. Come back to Me---not once, not twice, but always again. You are My child. How can you ever doubt that I will embrace you again, hold you against My breast, kiss you and let My hands run through your hair? I am your  God ---the  God  of mercy and compassion, the  God  of pardon and love, the  God  of tenderness and care. Please do not say that I have given up on you, that I cannot stand you anymore, that there is no way back. It is not true. I so much want you to be with Me. I so much want you to be close to Me. I know all your thoughts. I hear all your words. I see all of your actions.  And I love you because you are beautiful, made in My own image, an expression of My most intimate love.  Do not judge yourself. Do not condemn yourself. Do not reject yourself.  Let My love touch the deepest, most hidden corners of your heart and reveal to you your own beauty, a beauty that you have lost sight of, but which will become visible to you again in the light of My mercy . Come, come, let Me wipe your tears, and let My mouth come close to your ear and say to you, ‘ I love you, I love you, I love you .'
