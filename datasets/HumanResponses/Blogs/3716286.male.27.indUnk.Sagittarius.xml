Sat. we sa on the beach most of the day, then changed and walked the boardwalk the rest of the nite. it was beautiful. it could not have been a more perfect weekend. I love you Shannon.   --  Rob Rogers Website --> www.dmunkie.org Blog --> dmunkie.blogspot.com E-mail --> rob.rogers@gmail.com/drunknmunkie@gmail.com

      I had a really awesome night with my girl tonight. I picked her up from work, then we went to my store to visit. From there on we went to Logan's in Fair Lakes and had a wonderful dinner. I took her back to her work to get her car, and then we parted ways for te evening. It was awesome. I  LOVE YOU SHANNON!!  Peace, Rob

      I recently received my second PDA, a DELL AXIM X30 HIGH. 624mhz 64 RAM and ROM. nice deally, pretty screen. built in wireless. not too shabby. it replaces my HP 2215, which is only 2 months old. the HP is killer too, but the DELL is great for watching Movies and playing games.  Peace!
