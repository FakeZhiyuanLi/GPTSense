      Every body ends up some where. A few end up somewhere on purpose, they're the ones with vision. A clear vision with the faith and the courage to follow it through, Which for some can dramaticly increase the chances of coming to the end of their life, but at least then they can look back and be satified thinking i suceeded and finished well. The thing that scares some people with visions is the fact that maybe they will die to serve the vision but scared should only be those who don't know whether they will ever reach heaven.

      Saying mad is a luxoury you can't afford. Why? Because the bible says "Anger resides in the lap of fools" Which can mean only fools hold a grudge and cover their lives with anger. Not only does anger harm you but it is one of satan's ways of turning you from the ways of God.   To handle your anger try to...     1) Take a walk  Exercise burns of excess adrenalin and helps you to calm down and think things over more clearly, so if you happen to be in a place where there is alot of anger just simply walk away instead of getting involved.   2) Accept your limits  Be sure to recognize things you can't control like others attitudes , traffic, cancelled appointments or flights and count your blessings like health, the fact that you've got god, your family, your job and maybe the car that might get you to where you want to go like church.   3) Be careful where you release your anger  It's one thing to be angry but where you release your anger is another be sure when you are angry not to blow your lid around friends or family. But share calmly your feelings with those you trust and know will understand.   4) Don't hang out with angry people  like happiness and graditude angriness is contagious. So whenever God says dont hang out with angry people, It's good adivce, take it!

       Many people ask...   Why do i exist and what is my purpose???   But many people never find out.    The bible tells us specifically why God made us and what he thinks of us...     Deuteronomy 32:10-you are the apple of his eye     Exodus 19:5-you are his own special treasure, (which we are)     Isaiah 43:4-you are precious in his sight and he loves you     Isaiah43:7-you were created for his glory     Jeremiah31:3-he loves you with an everlasting love      To be a Christian you have to admit that your not perfect and you have faults in your life. Jesus' death on the cross provided salvation for all poeple in the world, but for it to be any use in your life you must believe that Jesus died for you and accept this free gift of salvation.     An example of salvation is, in bible times when a lie was said or done, a sacrifice of animal had to be made and when Jesus died he took away the sacrfices with his one great sacrifice,(his life), so now we just have to ask for forgivness and say we are sorry.    If you want to say sorry to God for all the wrong things you've done, but you don't know how, just repeat this prayer...    Dear Jesus,      Be my master, and rule my life with your love. Teach me to fo positive things, that are pleasing to you. That way, i'll get it right with your help. And then i'll be doing the do's and wont be concerned about the don'ts. Please Jesus forgive me of my sins      In Jesus name...    Amen

       The bible is God's word and the absolute truth.   There is one God who exists in three persons, God the father, God the son and God the holy spirit, (not three Gods, but one).   The only way to heaven in through Faith in Jesus Christ, he alone can forgive all our sins and make us acceptable to God.   The Holy Spirit lives in every born again Christian and is necessary to be saved, to have eternal life and live a life that is pleasing to God.       God will Always love you no matter what you do, but it doesn't mean you can do bad things and expect to be forgiven.
