      I've spent over two hours waiting for a telephone call and when this post is finished I shall give up on the waiting and do some  real  work instead of fooling around playing solitare as I have been doing.  In other news, I have decided on a new layout and like I promised, those music, mood and site things have gone, but fear not, thanks to  urlLink iMood  we have a lovely little smilie thing on the side menu so now you know my mood and get a lovely smilie as well - what more could you ask for?  Anyway, its a lovely day today so I think I might go outside and enjoy it, Ciao!

      Quite out of the blue ( mem. find the origin of that phrase) I have decided on several things; 1. To stop doing the Live Journal-esque things at the bottom 2. To try and put some things on the side bar 3. To use '()' instead of '[]' so much when doing brackets Of little consequence really, but this will be the last post of being in the style of Live Journal. Don't cry too much children.  Anyway; to the present, it's Sunday afternoon and I have nothing to do. Revision is always there, but that can be tiresome, I don't have a job, and haven't since I completed my work for  urlLink Hunter Seeds' website  and I haven't been able to buy myself a bass guitar yet.  A glance over today's 'world news stories' showed every one of them to be war-related. Seems that's all which is important today is war. Global Warming is of little consequence - in fact, it’s rather good if you’re Russia [warmer climate is better for their agriculture] and you don't really care if you’re America [because you ARE America and if it wasn't for them there would be a global depression]. Which I think is very thoughtful of the latter: economic depression soon or apocalypse later.

      Again I am blogging at a silly time in the evening, the time on this post is wrong to be honest - it is in fact the 30th by now but I decided to disguise it at the 29th so it looks nice and that I do one a day. Which I do, even if I am a day behind...  Anyway as today [yesterday] is [was] a Saturday I thought I deserved a lie in but eventually decided that it might be nice to be awake in time for lunch and I was just having a shave when I heard a knock at the door which told me that lunch was ready and there were a plate of spring rolls outside if I wanted them.  What is the point? People will do this to me all of the time, see I am busy and interrupt me with stuff; do I want to eat spring rolls while shaving? No. I'm holding a sandwich with a receipt in one hand while trying to put money in my wallet with the other; do I look like I need to be served? No. I'm reading a book; do I want someone to turn the lights off to save energy? No. I could continue on with this stream of stupidity but I won't and instead say this; if you ever meet me, whoever you may be, don't bother me with similar questions or actions!  Anyway before I do go to bed [which I really want to do] I wish you all good morning.  Good morning.  Music: Coldplay - Spies Mood: Dull Site:  urlLink http://www.neave.com

      Its quite late and I shouldn't be doing this as late as it is but hey. Anyway, today was my English Literature exam - an exam where it is by no means an exam on your knowledge of English literature and it isn't really an exam on  English  literature; my set text was Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; an American. The poems that I looked at were written by an American, a welsh person, an Irish person and a Scottish person. No one technically English was involved in my English exam. But what is it to be English? They all speak the same language, some of their descendents could have quite possibly been English and an 'English' persons ancestors could quite possibly be Anglo-Saxons or of some other European origin. Who is English?  As it is indeed Friday night [now Saturday morning], I went out for a meal earlier, except on finishing the mile walk to the Indian restaurant, one of our party realized they had forgot something which meant that I had to get from the restaurant, back to the house, and back again - a two mile round trip - all in time for the first course. I did it, partly as they were delayed by a few minutes and partly because I ran a good deal of it. Getting back to the restaurant I arrived in good time to receive my curry. I would like to inform anyone considering doing a two mile run and then going for a meal, to go for something a bit more cooler, like a sandwich, curries just don't seem to be quite the right thing.  On the topic of sandwiches I recommend a Safeway Chicken and Bacon 'sub' [you know, one of those baguette like things which isn't], at £2.69 its hardly value for money but for a cold and wet May day it worked for me. Speaking of baguettes, Sally's Place provides an excellent guide to them. Let them eat cake.

       "Hi" "Hey, how are you?" "Fine" "Good" So went the guilty conversation between a pair of builders who were taking a sneaky break from work and me, the son of their employer who appeared to be bunking off school. Neither of us could blame the other and so the conversation went.  Anyway, I'm not bunking off school as it is still study leave and I've just had the gruelling three hour IT exam, while it is simple it is incessantly dull; the practice exam I had for it back in the winter wasn't so bad as half way through a wasp landed on the next persons computer which provided a quick break of humor but alas, today, nothing.  Prior to meeting the builders [who to be fair, deserve as many breaks as they want] and after the exam, I decided on a visit to town where I purchased a portion of fish and chips, I consumed a good deal of them but left one or two because I wasn't very hungry. Point is I went to put them in a bin and this lovely old woman decided to comment; 'oooh look, he's throwing some of his chips away'. Yes I know I am, and I dare say your friend can see that as well. Why comment?  To be fair I quite like the way old people are very talkative to strangers, they normally talk to me if I am either alone or with a female friend [never if it is me and a male friend or me with several female friends], and usually they only talk about the weather but its still nice just to think that unlike the rest of our society, they can remain happy and content as well as confident to talk to strangers.  Finally while returning home I had the misfortune to be involved in a drive by in which I was 'shot' at by someone with a water gun. This has happened twice now, next time I will be sure to do something - what exactly I will do I am not sure of but who ever it is in that blue car with water guns will regret the day they crossed swords with the Don.

      This was going to be quite a bleak posting but the events of the last five minutes have managed to cheer me to a level above that. Most notably is my newly found cruel hobby of engaging arguments with argumentative people who don't have a chance of winning the said argument. It's cruel I know but secretly fun.  I had another dream which I can recall again, I don't know whether it is the fact that I am recording them that helps me remember them or what but here is last nights; I found myself in a shop with my father, the shop sells a variety of 1930s toys, especially models of cars, boats and trains, the shelves are dusty and the shop keeper wears old clothes and looks tired, I don't know why we went in there but when we come out again we have bought the shop. The next day I start work in the shop and decide that it needs to be cleaned and that way it can become successful, I start my attempts at cleaning it but I get tired and put on an old jumper and over the coming days I find myself transforming in to the old shop keeper. Well in other news I bought myself a replacement copy of Dracula [Bram Stoker] as I had lost my original copy, £1.50 - a bit of a bargain really. I have decided to re-read it as well, beats revision...  Music: The Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil Mood: Aloof Site:  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/.../...

      My German listening exam was dire, not to the extent of being not great, but a true calamity. I think it was destined to go badly, there were a number of clues but I didn't see them until now. I had another dream last night, I can't remember it exactly but it went a little like this; I am attending a posh dinner and I go wearing a tuxedo, someone I used to date is also attending and I remember how I still love her. She still hates me. I shrug it off; she never liked me and so nothing changes. In other news I have started re-reading all of Sherlock Holmes books, they are truly magnificent. Sign of Four this evening, brilliant. In other news I'm listening to the Cuban Overture as composed by George Gershwin, my brother tried to sell it to me as jazz but its quite simply, not the standard style of jazz. But its still good. To be honest I'm quite envious of any classical composer, it would be such a marvelous skill to be a good classical composer, despite lacking in the same recognition as their pop counterparts.

      I cook. I iron. I clean. I am the 21st century house husband - well maybe not but that's what I have been doing a lot of these past few days. I've spent most of the day losing time to trivial activities [in other words I took a siesta this afternoon] instead of revising for my  politically correct  German test tomorrow.  Its one thing to be hit with buzzwords like 'equal opportunities' and other social issues during lessons designated for such wastes of time but I think its taking things too far to be able to understand that: Ich halte Gleichberechtigung für sehr wichtig Which roughly means; I think equal opportunities are very important I could also inform you of how to say how to say something is racist or sexist... isn't this going too far? What are majority of people going to do with a GCSE in German? Some may go on to A Level, and then maybe take it to degree level but that's quite rare, shouldn't we focus on things that  will  be of use, not how to talk about people being 'der Gruppendruck' [peer pressure] or 'die Arbeitslosigkeit' [unemployment]. Let's focus on what will be of use, not what's 'politisch korrekt' [I think you can guess that one].  Oh I also had a dream last night; I am back in school [again] and I'm feeling quite lost, suddenly someone who I used to be seeing for a while runs up to me and talks to me briefly, she then moves in to kiss me but instead tears the flesh of my face. She runs off and I also go off and see a small year 9 girl who tells me that she ate my face. I respond 'yes, she did eat my face'. I carry on and no one else notices my absent face.

      Yesterday I neglected to mention that I had a letter from my  urlLink Careers advisor  the letter consisted of some 20 pages of the following; Notes of what I said [just encase I forgot what subjects I am taking at A Level] and careers that match my preferences, some of my favorites include 'Virtual Reality' and 'Science Fiction'. I'm guessing the former is where you have an imaginary job and the latter is where you pretend you work on a space ship. Maybe not.  Also I seem to be under constant attack from beetles looking rather similar to  urlLink May Beetles . While these pose no threat to my existence, I still feel it my duty to dispatch them, except I can't bare to kill the things so the result is a twenty minute chase in order to corner the thing and then send it out through the window and hope that it managed to survive the fall. I worry too much.  Anyway, I better do some  more  revision. It's all good.

      This morning I took a trip to Chester, for those who are unfamiliar with Chester, it is a rather charming place which got a bit too popular for its own good. Anyway I bought a few albums and a new jacket and wallet, both fit the idea of being 'smart/casual', which seems to be my current adopted style. Except for my hair which is just a mess.  My lunch consisted of going in to a small café known as 'The Crypt', a quick fifteen minute lunch extended to an hour due to their incompetence but after a complaint a full refund was obtained which equalled a free lunch for me. Top stuff!  After lunch I noticed an absurd number of fat people roaming the streets, maybe it was as I had just had lunch or they only come out after midday, point is, if your fat, why don't you try and make an attempt at hiding it, or more to the point, not advertising, for example, for the seriously obese, a 'crop top' is  not  a good idea. Wear a lot of black, and keep away from stripes. Worked for me when I was a bit podgy.

      Today I can say that nothing of any real value happened, my attempts at making lunch were not entirely successful as the custard for the intended pudding went a bit wrong, while it may be easier to do it in the microwave, I recommend you don't.  I also watched two hours worth of TV programs with Dan Cruickshank in, very sad I know but has anyone stopped to look at the coat he so often wears? Its rather wonderful in its own way but I don't know why. Today my friend read an article that had been written about her but as if she had written it after she had an interview with one of the journalists. The writer managed to infer that she was spoilt. Well said it to be precise which has my friend aggravated beyond measure as it looks as if she is admitting to it. Which she should. Just joking.

      I had my second maths paper today, that is all I will mention of it and its evil.  After the exam I went in to town to see someone off on the bus and then decided to stop by the record store, during my time there I managed to kick the store clerk [well kind of nudged him with my leg] and bought a Joy Division t-shirt.  Only when I got home did I realize Joy Division never released any official t-shirts [can't remember where I heard that but I think its true], but its not too bad; I only know one other person who knows of Joy Division so I doubt they're going to tear me down for wearing a fake, assuming they know it is.  Finally my horoscope tells me to look for romance. Hmmm.  Music: Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart Mood: Relaxed! Site:  urlLink http://www.horoscope.com/

       meÂ·chanÂ·ic - noun. A worker skilled in making, using, or repairing machines, vehicles, and tools. Mechanics are great. Well except for the dodgy ones, but in general, rather brilliant. The save us hundreds of pounds and by making things last longer, help the environment. Yes, mechanics are quite vital to our society.  Except if you look a bit further down the dictionary you will see another meaning;  The branch of physics that is concerned with the analysis of the action of forces on matter or material systems  Now I'm sure mechanics [the second version] in the right hands can be really useful, just it doesn't seem that useful to know what the tension is on a piece of string between two objects. Oh and I have the exam tomorrow.  In other news my relative who was given two months last week died last night. I seem remarkably untouched by the whole episode but that might be for the best as I have my GCSEs to concentrate on now.

      It is my belief that we underestimate the Irish - today I had an Advanced Maths paper and unlike the British exam boards, the Irish didn't have a single 'Blank Page' [which are always labeled 'Blank Page']. So this meant even the back cover was used - very economical! However I didn't know this and thus missed off the final question... Good for the consumption of paper in Ireland, bad for my grade [well 8% of it anyway].  I have also decided that exams are only good for providing an excuse to hug pretty much anyone, a fact I intend to abuse as much as possible over the next few weeks. Also prior to my maths exam a friend came over to 'revise', instead we locked horns in a match of  urlLink Worms World Party , my friend however has an unnatural ability at the game, however today I beat him in the two matches we played. Seems I can win at something, just nothing useful...  Finally I recommend the link at the bottom highly; strange that something so inexplicably annoying can be made to be mildly amusing by calling it a game and adding music but then again by listening to my MP3 player and thinking life is a bit of a game I guess I have done the same for my mildly amusing life.

      So my prom date is ignoring me, I had 2 people in my family diagnosed with cancer last week and I discovered that I am rather poor at Advanced Maths which I'm studying which leaves me with very little left to hope for.  In other news I had a rather interesting dream last night;   I'm back in the forth year and I arrive for school in my uniform but everyone else is dressed casually so I go home and change but when I get back casually dressed, everyone is in uniform and each time I change yet remain different to everyone else, no one notices that  I  am different.   Fairly easy to interpret if I say so myself. I'm fascinated by dreams, they can say so much and often with doing so little. I guess I should thank  urlLink Sigmund Freud  really - just I can't see anything sexual in being dressed differently.  Music: Radiohead - Exit Music (For A Film) Mood: Failed.

      I arrived quite late to maths this morning but no one seemed to bothered. 3 Days until the exam... I'm not really too worried which in itself worries me. My current movie recommendation is for Van Helsing. It's not really a great film, its alright but Richard Roxburgh is in it who is rather special in his own little way.  In other news I discovered that 'painting' your nails with permanent marker is  not  a good idea - I thought it was yesterday while idly colouring them in blue, now 24 hours on I have been able to get most of it off except the bits around the edges which prove to be the most annoying.  Finally my father managed to get a small bargain from Aldi yesterday, a Pocket PC, or a 'Multimedia Pocket PC PDA with GPS Navigation' to be precise. But like all things from Aldi which seem to good to be true, this little technological master piece isn't all that it could be. Think of it like this; just because it is a fraction of the size of a standard PC, doesn't mean you'll have a fraction of the problems - quite the opposite. Still it has Solitaire on it so I'm not too bothered plus I have managed to fix number of these problems.  Oh and at the bottom there is a link to do a practice theory exam; 26/35 means I failed!

      My shirt is signed and I have had more hugs than a bear, yes - today was the end of high school. Except I have to go in tomorrow. Then next Monday, and Tuesday... Well it was the last  official  day. According to my shirt I'm God and I have enough 'good luck's to repel a lot of those cursing chain mails.  So I have spent over 12 years of my life in education now, taken from society and not given anything back. A pleasing thought that. Last night I found myself watching Question Time from St Andrews featuring some 20 something who I announce to be very irritating. On the issue of  urlLink a 14 year old becoming pregnant and having an abortion without the mother's knowledge  she said that it showed that the government's health and education departments have failed. Now I am not a great supporter of the current British government isn't this a little extreme? It's like saying that because one crime occurred, the police have failed. This same woman had this annoying habit of calling 'here here' to anything anti-government - I dare say that if it was announced that Tony Blair 'smells' she would have called 'here here' to that as well.  On a more personal note I finally asked someone to the prom and she said yes. Now I need to find my self a tux and everything else that goes with it... She's worth it though!

      One more day of High School left; I won't be sad, quite happy that it is finally the end, High School was never my thing. Today I had my German speaking exam it didn't go too bad apart from the following mistakes I made;   &#8729; I eat pizza for breakfast.  &#8729; I don't go swimming in the swimming pool; I go swimming in the river Rhine.  &#8729; My father is dead. [He isn't]  In a bitter irony though I have since been told that my  grand father has two months to live: On Monday he was admitted to hospital, on Tuesday he was diagnosed with cancer, on Wednesday they operated and now it is Thursday and he has two months to live.  It's a common question, but what does one do if they are told they have two months to live? I don't really know, but surely if we do  live  then there is nothing to be done, just to carry on with our lives until something does happen? For example by going around the world on holiday, aren't we saying that we haven't lived and now we are trying to get something back that we lost? Could it not also be said that we are giving up - admitting that we're beaten, a doctors judgment our death sentence?

      Today was  the  definitive typical day. I mean there was nothing unusual, nothing to cause any emotion in me. Subsequently I am feeling quite tired for having had such an uninspiring day. Tomorrow I have my German oral exam, after calling my examiner a dragon last week (and yes, she did hear me) I am not entirely looking forward to it. On hindsight I think she not really like a dragon - more like  urlLink The Watcher  from Lord of the Rings [I'm not a big Tolkien fan, just someone bought me the game at Christmas which I felt obliged to play].  In other news a small ray of sunshine hit my inbox this morning with news that Ross Noble has returned from Australia to unveil his new show 'Noodlemeister'. Which is a good thing but it now makes my t-shirt for the 'Unrealtime' tour look somewhat dated.

      I think I have this sorted out; Careers advisers only interview people as they feel they have failed to get a ‘real’ career and must validate themselves by interviewing others. Yes, today I was chosen quite randomly to be interviewed. It seems to be a matter of stating the obvious ['so your good at maths and your taking economics... have you ever thought of being an accountant?']. Eventually I decided that I would make out that engineering would be the career for me so she wouldn't have to continue guessing jobs for me - the plan seemed to work as the interview was concluded fairly quickly after that.  4 Days until the end now; I had two random second or third years [they all look so alike] randomly scream in my face today. Perhaps it’s a hormone thing, I don't know but I remember not doing it to year 11s when I was a little second year. They should have more respect for their elders!

      Well the taster day at sixth form went alright; Economics seems strangely interesting and our head introduced his speech with the great line; 'this is not a speech'. I have this wonderful plan to sit in the common room and drink coffee out of a thermos in there all day. Yes. I aspire to great levels.  But you can not disagree [double negative, naughty me] that it does sound awfully nice. I just need to find someone who likes coffee to enjoy it such moments with me; rain lashing down on the windows outside while we sit in drinking warm coffee watching the more misfortunate people traipse in while we are both roasty toasty.  Just sounds so very snug and yes, I do need to get out more.

      Another day wasted - well not totally wasted but 90% wasted at least! Anyway, I managed 6 hours with my contact lenses today after spending 20 minutes getting them in. Really need to work on that.  Tomorrow is my 'taster day' at sixth form, I haven't applied to anywhere else so if I don't like it then I'm in for a bit of bumpy ride really. If I do then that's excellent. Let us hope for the latter option.  So tomorrow I will be back; back without a Caramac.

      Well today I managed to watch another episode of the original Charlie's Angels, they don't make them like that anymore, groovy flares and all! Groovy! Anyway, contact lens insertion time is still 15 minutes but I kept them in for over 5 hours today - I'm going to try for 7 or 8 tomorrow... and I'm supposed to build up gradually apparently... oh well!  Finally I would like to urge anyone working in a Saturday job, a temporary job, or in actual fact, any job to quit as I still can't find myself a job and that would create more vacancies for me to try for.

      Well I have managed to reduce the time it takes to put a contact lens in by 20, to 15 minutes!  How fabulous. Well I'm still bitter over last night but that's more me than anything. Today was spent in the pursuit of nothing which has probably made things worse. Oh well.  Just me.

      I commence with last nights dream as an introduction; I was on a Viking longboat sailing around an Eastern European country, somewhere not dissimilar to Prague in the Czech Republic. In the night sky are three moons, each carrying its own evil grin toward me, along the city streets lie animals in cages, possessed by an evil force as is each building, only the mortar stop it from escaping. I have a pewter staff though, on one side is the Christian Cross engraved; another shows Father Time - I cover the staff in a dark liquid and then this repels the evil; the three moons shrink in to one; the animals return to their normal form and the buildings return to their previous inanimate state. The Longboat continues to sail around the city and gradually the howling of wolves stop as I use my staff to repel evil.   Eventually the longboat makes one final turn and it hits a black wall, the wall doesn't smash the boat; instead it splits in half letting us pass through and only then do I realize that its just a fair ground ride. So to today, or this evening more importantly; with less than an hour left my prom date confirmed that she would be going to the prom and subsequently, I got changed and in due course, got to the venue. I played my part as a gentlemen better than ever but she just didn't seem interested me. She even left without informing me and so I too left and found myself watching Paul McCartney at Glastonbury, ending his set with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [the reprise].  We're Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We hope you have enjoyed the show Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We're sorry but it's time to go. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We'd like to thank you once again Sergeant Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band It's getting very near the end Sergeant Pepper's lonely Sergeant Pepper's lonely Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. My life has a habit of playing songs to be ironic at me. Oh well, I guess that might be the last time I see her, so is the way of puppy love.  Well good luck to everyone else as I seem to be out of it. I'll end this with irony;   We're sorry but it's time to go.

        *phone rings*  Me: Hello? Caller: Hello, is Mr Pearson there? Me:  *another call for my dad*  No, can I take a message? Caller: Well could you tell Stephen Pearson that he needs to come in about his contact lenses Me:  *ooh thats me*  I'll make sure he knows this minute. Good bye Caller: Bye So went the call from my optician, in due course I went to the opticians to collect them; Me: Hello, it's Stephen Pearson about some contact lenses Receptionist: What about them? Me: Well I was hoping you could tell me... you call me, me... me brother! This morning about them Receptionist: Oh, well you can take them away now if you've had 'THE TEACH' Ok so I over emphasise the idea of the THE TEACH but to cut to the chase, basically 'THE TEACH' is where your told how to put them in and take them out and as I looked around seeing the opticians to be completely empty, I was told that they were quite busy so I have to go back tomorrow for THE TEACH.

      Ironically, I hate students despite being one of them, and this is why;  After being turned down for a job at Safeway, I was on my way to the Job Centre who also had nothing for me, but on the way I met a student; Student: Hi Me: Hi Student: What are you listening to? Me: oh erm, Joy Division Student: Oh I've never heard of them, are they old or new? Me: Old  She carries on with small talk for a while  Student: Anyway, do you know what stress is? Me:  *the evil part of my brain was telling me to tell her to naff off - I'm that evil*  Yes Student: Well we're doing yoga classes for students Me: Well I don't really get stressed that often so no, not for me Student: Yes, you look pretty chilled out, well how about a donation? Me: Sorry I've no money on me Anyway, I've tried 3 places for work, nothing so far, I'll try two more tomorrow then I will give up - yay!

      My room is red! Oh life is so wonderful right now - I am to paint the skirting boards for the rest of the house and in return a bass guitar shall be mine! My life seems to be coming together!  But for a moment I would like to talk about my room; it went all rather smoothly until I had washed all the brushes and then came to packing away the dust sheets which had some wet white paint on from the previous day and my assistant managed to get several white streaks of this on to my fine wall - so back went the dust sheets, had to re-wash the brush... But it is worth it, even if it does look like an Indian restaurant.

      Well today was as predicted, a happy day spent painting listening to Steve Wright; today I only did the ceiling - tomorrow its the walls... Should be interesting...  A few tips for wanna-be decorators;    Paint barefooted, its cheaper to wash feat than buy new socks  If you use linen dust sheets - make sure they are thick enough else you get paint on the carpet like I did  Use a radio that doesn't matter if it gets paint on  If you can afford it, use rollers in a disposable fashion - they take years to clean    I will post a picture somewhere to show you the finished result... Until then; Fabius out.

      Well seems my 100 minute appointment was actually two 10 minute ones separated by 80 minutes which left me stranded in town with nothing to do - fortunately I sought refuge in the library where a copy of The Times entertained me, as did the rather comically written sign saying 'Watch out! Thief About!' further reading informed me that some lost soul is going around there stealing... not really a criminal mastermind who ever they are.  The actual optician was a finer guy as any - had a wonderfully dark sense of humour which I admire in anyone, especially in people such as him. 'We'll give you a free trial, come in after a month and we'll sort out payment, assuming you’ll make it back!’  Sadly I couldn't begin decorating today... hopefully tomorrow...

      Well I've been waiting for summer for so long and now its here it is quite frankly, rather dull! I mean I spent all my money yesterday and I don't have a job which leaves me with nothing to do as I can't afford to do it really as I don't want to use money from my guitar/camera fund.  Oh well, enough of my troubles; Today while hopping around channels I discovered on BBC4 was Brian Wilson [of The Beach Boys] doing a live performance of the Pet Sounds album with his new 10 piece band...  wouldn't it be nice  if he could still hit those high notes, which he unfortunately can't and so I ended up flicking over to the ever-reliable 'Bid Up TV' - as the name suggests its an auction on TV but it is one of the funniest things ever!  The average presenter is a bit of a flop and that’s the only reason why they are working there is because they aren't really top quality but they do work their hearts out on it all. However the presenters are nothing compared to the audience; despite selling all manner of rubbish, people ALWAYS bid, and this is the odd part; it costs £1 to bid, so instead of putting in a safer high bid, at the start people will bid the minimum £1. I have  never  seen anything go for £1, so why do they think today should be any different?  Poor misguided bidders... speaking of which I hopefully will be bidding on a camera on eBay. Poor misguided me.

      Yes my hair is cut and it doesn't look too bad, today I used some gum stuff, it’s odd; neither like wax nor gel but better than both in my view. Anyway took another visit to Chester... seemed less fat people today than last time but they seemed slightly fatter than before. Anyway I was pressurized in to buying a Big Issue type thing today by the seller and my friend, £3 for something which was patently worth hardly anything as it was just photocopied.  Lesson; don't give in to peer pressure.

      Well today I had my history exam, which is the last major exam really so this posting will instead be dedicated to politics.  Well the EU elections are over and it appears that in general, few people bothered to vote in the elections, and a great deal of those did, voted for parties campaigning against the EU, including my much hated UKIP. I think Kilroy-Silk put why not to vote for them best - when asked what he intended to do in the EU parliament he replied to 'wreck' it in a news conference yesterday, in which he overshadowed UKIPs leader who was also present.  I don't look upon him at all kindly if you hadn't noticed, he was forced to resign from his previous job after some racsist comments. And he didn't do well in that job to make good television [awful daytime television instead];   urlLink http://www.robertkilroysilk.com   Rant over. Kilroy bad. Green Party good.

      Wow, I had an English exam, something that was dangerously too exciting to me. Maybe because I had a little fun in it;  I linked a poem by John Agard to being similar to a song by Paul McCartney  I quoted lyrics from an REM song  In my original writing, God spoke on the PA  Weak but it got me through the whole tedious experience. Sadly I have a history exam tomorrow which is slightly harder to make your own fun in - I might try something but there isn't much room to manoeuvre with the Magna Carta.  Anyway I better be off revising for it, so I'll make like a tree [and leave/leaf]...

      So what happened today? I worked a lot and that's been about it, I have secured about £110 for doing up my room and that's going to commence on Friday when my cold blue room turns to a dark red lair with  urlLink bats on the wall . I shall be envied!  Well I still have little time to write here, just a few notes; I am still off finding myself a girlfriend, it’s all too much hassle really at the moment and I am still addicted to the deadly concoction of concentrated fruit drinks warmed to lava-like temperatures. But in all the mayhem, I did have the following thought;  Squirrels. So the grey variety are rather detested but they do have a few trials in their life as I noted this morning that manufactures of bird feeders often make squirrel proof accessories, most commonly 'THE DOME'.  [see this link  urlLink http://www.duncraft.com/prodimg/1092_200.jpg ]  Anyway, little squirrel comes along, asses the situation - can't get at it from anyway than via the top so he climbs a tree, gets on the dome and thwump, he's fallen to the ground and he can't stand on it. Now we must think how they test them, they probably have a garden where they trial the new bird feeders, now think of the poor resident squirrel, each month or so a new feeder comes along, and each time he has no such luck, that squirrel is going to be getting mighty paranoid, he's probably scared of picking up little berries in fear that there is a grand piano suspended above it ready to be dropped on him. Maybe not. Well it looks like I am ranting which means something is bothering me deep down.  Ah well, another long post will arrive on Thursday and then every day after that if your good boys and girls.

No not this one Me: Well see you next Friday there then Her: It's not next Friday. Its a month next Friday. Me: Oh. Ah well, time isn't my game.

      Went in to town today for a pork with stuffing and apple sauce baguette - tasty! Anyway not much to mention other than I had a rather interesting dream last night; I sit with a few friends on a bench next to a man; the man is of 60 years of age and is very thin, his clothes hang off his frail body and his skin is unnaturally white. While I am sat next to him I am conscious that he is evil and planning on stealing something off me so I try to get up and move away except I can't. Stuck fast I wait and eventually he gets up and I stand up at the same time, he then goes to embrace me and I reach to protect him from stealing my watch, I hold on tightly to it so that eventually he realises he can't get it and subsequently walks off. I then realise that he was Father Time. Looks like this was just a short one. Again.

      Recently I have felt that my postings have got rather dull, well I think I can blame this on the GCSEs (I'm blaming anything I can on them), so don't worry, less than a month left. Wow. Less than a month left. I had not thought of it like that. To be precise its less than two weeks then a history exam a week after, but thats not too much.  Well with that little excuse I'll be off for some sleep. It's still too hot these days.

      This applies to everything involving chairs. From trains to dinning, we often have to book a chair, a chair is then allotted to us and at the right time we use it. So why on earth can't people realise this when it comes to sitting down?  Today I had my geography exam [the irony here is amazing] in which I found someone where I was meant to be sat, after a brief silent argument [mostly hand gestures] they refused to move so I was forced in to sitting else where. So in geography exam they couldn't navigate to their seat. What is the world coming to? Short of putting up neon signs pointing out which seat is yours, there isn't much else people can do other than say which seat is yours and make sure you know it. If you’re on a train, you can SEE the reserved ticket things on the seat. Why, oh why can't people SEE them?  That said geography didn't go too badly. Well Thursday is when my next exam so tonight has been my little 'break' as it were - basically wasting time listening to Talking Heads while complaining to friends about the heat - which is unbearable. REALLY awful. Just think, global warming will give us another ice age, or alternatively we could have a more Mediterranean style climate. Frankly things are hot enough as they are - and too cold in winter so lets not contribute to global warming folks.

      Well my computer slow down problem was solved by... Microsoft [or Micro$oft if you don't like them], and it wasn't really solved by them but their lovely 'System Restore' feature. Anyway...  Today I got my hands on a copy of  Practical Photographer  which is a very interesting read, quite inspiring to me really... I just need to get a camera.  Among my revision I also had to happen upon some bhangra songs, they're not that bad to be honest, not my thing, but most certainly listenable.  My apologies for this being like a list in awfully short paragraphs, so to end that I have one of my dreams to write up; I find myself as a soldier in a kind of marsh area which we are attacking, after a bitter fight forward I board one amphibious vehicle and advance forward where after climbing what looks to be an embankment, the vehicle becomes a small yellow boat.  I find myself the commander of a fleet of similar boats and we advance on the retreating enemy, about half way across this ocean of sorts, I predicted that they would try to counter attack. In preparation I drew up the rest of my fleet and readied to defend which we successfully did, now they retreated with no hope of winning so I paddle furiously with my hands to another similar dinghy, on getting close the solitary sailor jumps over board and one of my men jumps on to replace him [where he came from I do not know], we then paddle back with the extra boat. Well just another day with just another dream.

      Well today I thought I might do something worthy of note - unlike yesterday - so I went on a little expedition to the book shop and bought a copy of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley as I had finished reading Dracula yesterday. While in town I met some 'friends' - the sort that are alright really just they can be an embarrassment to themselves at times (if you are one of those people... well lets just hope your not).  Also I had to cook myself lunch and dinner, and on both occasions I cooked twice as much as what was needed which has left me feeling somewhat tired. On a final note this weekend is the 60th anniversary of D-Day; a day when no one is sure whether they are celebrating or 'commemorating'. Shame really, anyway, over and out.

      I have had one of those 'its-a-crap-day-and-I-don't-know-why' days. I mean I got to the bottom of my problem with my computer running slowly - Norton Anti Virus apparently but it has also been so tiresome on me; after a number of things going wrong after my interference I sought consolidation in a friend, I use the term loosely as I have my suspicions to whether she likes me, and in keeping with my suspicions she was as cold as ever toward me.  So what good has come of today? I did minimal work and so now feel naturally unsatisfied with myself and I have a cold and everyone’s being mean to me and... and... *Cries*. Seriously for a moment though, I always feel so much younger in the sense of being 'immature' when I feel low like this, I don't know why but I do - perhaps it is because when we are children we have more moments when we do feel so insecure and so our experience of being insecure comes mostly from a time when we were immature hence we go back to that immature nature when we are insecure. Maybe.

      Well 3 decisions in 24 fours;  Not buy a bass guitar - buy an acoustic  Buy an SLR camera [the expensive sort]  Get a hair cut   Quite a decisive day really, the second idea stems from the first as with the money saved I could buy a nice camera; take some artistic style photos and post them here for all of your viewing pleasure!  And the hair. Well, quite genuinely it is big but certainly not clever; perhaps if I let it grow longer it might be but it's doubtful and it is a mega mess at the moment so best just get it cut.  Also I had a rather long and complex dream last night, consisting of two parts;   Part 1  I am with a group of people I know touring an old tower, at the very top there is the garrison of oversized  urlLink die cast figurines , one of them rides around the room on his horse and eventually we leave. Once outside I find out that they are evil and are currently under siege so I help in destroying them; they are going to come out and attack us and so in preparation we form a line and pass eggs down it until it gets to the final group of people of which I am one, smash them on the ground. I smash two eggs and when they hit the ground they turn out to be made of glass and are hollow, I fear that I might get in trouble for breaking them so I go in to the growing crowd.  As expected the door opens and the besieged come out but instead of being the model soldiers they are tourists who come out with their hands above their heads and carefully walk across the glass and are arrested. As they march out I see one of them dressed up impersonating my dead grandfather. They are evil.   Part 2  I am alone with a friend on the top of a mountain at an abandoned picnic area. Between one peak and another of this mountain there is a Chinese temple which, my friend tells me, contains lions and goes down there to tame the lions. I instead look around and find my father, together we get in a cable car and after calling someone it begins to move quite normally, except when it gets to the first support it shakes violently and stops, after a brief pause it continues but on each support it shakes even more violently, so much so that bottom and sides disappear and I have to hold on to a pole connected to the ceiling. During this life-threatening voyage I compare my plight to that of a soft toy holding on to a balloon, on hindsight I think of this as being very strange.  Eventually the remains of the cable car arrive at the other station and we walk through a cabin and meet a couple who run the cable car, we find out that we are in a foreign land and must get back to Britain, so we all go in their car, trying to get to a port. At one point we come across a river which we must cross, the driver decides to accelerate but when it hits the river it flips over as I had predicted. Somehow we find ourselves on the road again. On the journey to the port we run out of food and occasionally stop to get more but when it looks like we are running low on money as well, we stop at a van which sells food and the man gets out and while I am in the car some distance away, I can see him, he buys himself a large piece of meat and eats it, my mum [who has now also appeared] drives off leaving him stranded with the meat. We carry on driving until an undefined point where it all stopped. Sorry this posting is so long but I wanted to include it all. One last thing - DON'T vote for the UK Independence Party. I would list my reasons but this post is already too long so just listen to any debate featuring a representative of the UKIP and you'll see why.

      My God! What is this? I'm awake in time to experience a normal day instead of being nocturnal?! Yes, it is all true, due to some fool waking me up at the unearthly hour at 7am. Personally I didn't know of its existence until this morning.  Anyway, unlike yesterday where I was waiting for a call, today I am waiting for a parcel and with a bit of luck it should arrive soon containing  urlLink Joss Stone's  album.  As it is very early I can also remember my dream from last night; I have got a job in an office for a couple of weeks and it is my first day, I go to the third floor in the lift with a German, I don't know much German but I manage to answer his question of 'how did you get here?' by saying 'by foot'. I then go around trying to find my office but realize that I haven't a clue where it is and so after a while I decide to take the bus back home, except now I have no shoes so I am stuck in this office. While walking around looking for my shoes a man falls down the stairs and opens a cupboard before dying, there I see my shoes and my army jacket [why I don't know] but they are taken from me as part of the death before I can claim them. Anyway yesterday I read that they will be adding more domains; soon Star Trek fans might be able to be it www.geeks.klingon etc, well I had a small brainwave, why not move all those dodgy websites which you find yourself on if you type an address wrong to being at a .con address, that way they get to have the exact address and only those who miss type an 'm' and put 'n' will find themselves there [which is probably just me]. I know it is flawed in that no one would want to have a .con as no one would want to go to it, but its a nice idea to thing that all those pyramid schemes and 'manhood' enlargers could be in one place where no one dare goes.

Other than that brief episode today has been somewhat uneventful - tomorrow though I might be geting a bass guitar! Whoo!

        urlLink      A photo [taken by my JVC GC-A50 camera] while walking past this piece of writing in a busy street and wanted to capture the piece without stopping. Hence it is taken while I was walking so at an angle I have purposely neglected to sort out [the photo was taken on holiday a few years ago in another European country - I won't say which as I have seen similar statements in other countries as well as Britain]      So why have I posted a picture of a politically incorrect statement to my blog? Because quite frankly I can - I far from agree with it - my beliefs are quite opposite really but I am not going to get to my political beliefs just yet. So here is my piece; should this statement be removed?  &nbsp;

      Ok so this is what happened between this post and my last post;&nbsp;    Having used up my 15 minutes to the full I turned to leave and found that my party had left for some church leaving me to make my way to the station to meet in 30 minutes so I arrived at the station in 5 minutes and discovered another internet café so now I have 20 minutes here! Well to add anything more would be pointless as I will have access to my note book when I come to type up my full voyages on here but I will detail my reading so far;     1984&nbsp;- George Orwell  Gulliver's Travels - Jonathan Swift  Bones and Silence -&nbsp;Reginald Hill   All 3 are worthy of reading - The first being the best by far obviously but the other two have seen my through this holiday without a loss of sanity... anyway 3 minutes left and it took an awfully long time to publish last time so I will end this posting... here.

      So I get back tomorrow but for your reading delight your all getting a live posting from a small cyber cafe in Italy! The rest I will write up from my pocket note book and then date them as if I had done them live but this will be the only live one. &nbsp; So Italy... well it's nice enough - I'll be posting my full conclusions on my last post which will be dated as tomorrow but will be posted the day after tomorrow - well it doesn't seem to make much sense now but when it is all done it should all figure. &nbsp; To the present - they do cyber cafes as well as anywhere - a QWERTY keyboard is still a QWERTY keyboard (Unlike in the Czech Republic where is a QWERTZ - the only difference but amazingly quite annoying!). The machine I haveto use is a lovely black Dell which I have become quite fond of during the past 10 minutes... anyway time presses - I only bought 15 minutes and that is disappearing quite rapidly! &nbsp; Ciao to all... Fabius!

        urlLink      Where's Wally? Or more precisely, where am I? Well click to see the image larger and try and spot me reading from 92m - answer at the bottom of this post  Today was rather wonderful;    While other members of my party chose to go around a few of Bologna's older churches, I found myself a quiet square and sat on a wall, learnt against a pillar I read, during my reading an accordion player came along near by and played various parts of various songs - 'fragments of Somewhere Over the Rainbow' drifted my way at one point while a pair of old Italian men laid out some crisp white wooden chairs for an outdoor concert while the smells of a local bakery filled the air along with the pleasantly warm sun.

      Well it's hot but bearable - especially in an air conditioned art gallery in Parma - most amiable to spend a morning there - even if other members in the Party were rushing about as if it were a supermarket and the aim was to complete it as soon as possible... well ciao!

      If you've ever wondered how to get that smile from a waiter or waitress after giving a tip but your too tight not to give a tip... here's how you can get one; pay up and leave a few coins on the table as you finish the coffee round, get up, glance at the tip and smile to a member of staff - when they look away you grab the coins and leave. So was the method of paying of payment for a coffee I had this evening [by the way I do tip generously generally - just today someone else was paying].  So the flight to Italy was fine enough - my first meal was a challenge though - my only phrases of Italian being 'per favore' [I would like], gratzie [thanks] and ciao [hello/bye]... so what meals did I know in Italian? Well McChicken Nuggets is the same in Italian and from there it was fairly easy if I say so myself. So maybe I might develop my ability tomorrow, maybe not.

      I have reached the stage of holiday planning where I am having to wear old clothes which I won't be wanting to take on holiday so today finds me in typical 'townie' attire by which I mean I am wearing a Reebok t-shirt - I feel so dirty! Actually I do as an unfortunate accident with a carton of orange juice has left me smelling of the stuff quite badly of the stuff.  Anyway I require an early night so I can wake up early for work tomorrow! Away!

      Well instead of going to Chester I stayed at home and watched Sherlock Holmes DVDs while drinking ginger beers... days not working for me are not existing.  In other news I dug up a O/S map remember a dream I had many years ago. I look out of my bed room window and realize that the true love on my life lies out in that very direction. So I go off to find her - I can't see it from my window but I soon discover that to reach her I must cross some very steep hills but eventually I find her in a small one roomed hovel and we live happily ever after. Now this dream occurred 5 years ago I estimate but it holds significance for two reasons;  -5 degrees in the direction of my window lies the house of an ex-girlfriend [who happens to live in a bungalow [the closest to a hovel really in terms of size]... I once cycled to her and discovered the route to involve going up [and down] many hills  +10 degrees in the direction my window lives a close friend who lives very far away and subsequently between us lie many hills  While the second is a very vague coincidence I can't help to shake off a feeling on the first one may have a little fate in it... just a shame her title is  ex -girlfriend.

      My second to last day of work and I am struck by the fact that once this is over and I return off holiday I will need to find another job. Shame really - £25 a day isn't too bad for 5 hours work... but like all things it must end. Tomorrow I think I might go out to Chester... again...

      Wow, I've been secretly enjoying my work - doing websites and being paid for it but this time serious money - £75 for 3 days work! But it can be quite busy and I've spent most of this evening doing more work for it to add to it tomorrow, I fear I might get it done faster than expected and so receive a pay cut as I will have been working less hours...  Anyway as I have been at a computer all day and evening I'll be off now so this is only a short posting... Ciao!

      Well today I was going to commence work at school... But it turns out I couldn't so I start tomorrow... So I went off in to town to find another way to spend my time... And instead spent my money on a copy of Commandos 3 and a David Bowie album - both of which have been keeping my occupied through the afternoon.  During a conversation with someone doing similar work to me I found out what they had done... Lets just say there work will be better than mine will ever be and the other persons was far worse than anything I would ever admit to be mine!  Anyway there is a thunderstorm I want to watch so I'll be off now... Bye!

      Well while taking in a bit of jazz I'll describe today and tomorrow for you;  Waking up a little later than what I should have I was forced to rush putting in my contact lenses and then got to an eye appointment [again] quarter of an hour late. Fortunately though the opticians where quite empty and so my delay wasn't of much importance to anyone except myself.  The rest of the day has been idled away but I have decided to go for this job I was offered tomorrow so in preparation for that I have assembled the following; a thermos flask for coffee [in case it is a cold day], a bottle for water [in case it is hot day] and a copy of George Orwell - Nineteen Eighty Four [in case it is a boring day].  Apparently my payment will be of £50 so I will be very happy once I get it and I also get to give someone a little present who I otherwise wouldn't see for a long time - all in all - it should be okay if all goes well!

      A day of boredom in Shropshire; the peak of entertainment came from locating one of those grabber devices for reaching tins off high shelves, using it I set myself various challenges, pouring a glass of 7 Up for example... Truly thrilling and after I could take as much of that as I could I went back to the people...   After hearing the elder residence of Shropshire comment how much I have grown over the years for about five minutes straight I was driven back to my game of pouring 7 Up. What a great day huh?   Anyway that will be all for now.

      Well I was intending to go to Chester today but unfortunately that got called off so I instead went to Stoke and saw Shrek 2 and noted the following;  British people are becoming more American.  Yes that was all but its quite annoying, applauding a film when it starts... why? Who is going to hear your appreciation and be happy about it... the projectionist? Otherwise it wasn't so bad, a song by Counting Crows opening but then it was mostly covers of other songs - Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't 've?) by The Buzzcocks for example.  In other news I have been commissioned to work on another website! Yes, from doing websites on genealogy, to selling grass seeds my next project is for... my old secondary school! Well that's all I know as someone took the call for me and said I would be here so they should call then... but guess what? I'm not here tomorrow! So now I have to figure out how to answer a call when I am not there to take it.  Ideas?

      Of the few PC games I do play these days, I only ever play Real Time Strategies [or RTS for those who like abbrevations]; 'Rome wasn't built in a day' is a great expression with which to describe my evening playing a LAN deathmatch, after a couple of hours of building up a super economy [yes, it is unnecessary but I always want to have maxed out stuff on everything] I then attack and have my 'Grand Armee' kill pretty much anything with two [or four if there are horses] legs which leaves me using cannons to slowly destroy everything made of mortar which they own.  So yes, I wasted today. But I might join some work at home scheme... sounds like a scam though...

      Apparently my friend can't make in on Monday now - her parents said no so what money she had saved went on a pair of trainers instead. I feel so utterly lost - most of my friends are away on holiday as well which leaves me a skeleton crew with which to go running to with my problems. I might have to rename my blog 'The Fall and Fall of Mr Stephen Pearson' from the 'Misadventures' - but the later also seems appropriate right now.  I was looking forward to seeing her so much it has come as a stronger blow than what it should have - but then again it does mean I am going to be stuck around Cheltenham with nothing to do but contemplate it over the coming days.

      This week really is starting to get me down - all I did today was sit about and watch films; an appuling horror film and 'Trojan War' - a film following a guys attempts and getting condoms - not  the  Trojan War. Nothing much to say...

      Another day went by and another day was wasted; I did watch the 1939 version of The Hunchback of Notré Dame which did provide a short window of pleasure. At least I get to look forward to Monday when I meet up with my friend.

      There is one thing I don't like about holidays; a lack of routine. While many people dislike the idea of a routine, I quite like it, maybe not a strict one but some general idea as otherwise I find myself wasting every moment of every day doing silly things which don't benefit me in anyway, I might as well be drinking poison for the times like these.

      Several things about today;   I'm thinking of trying my hand at pen related art - well cartoonist and typography to be precise... just an idea at the moment  I've decided I need a second chance with everyone  I need to do something about my hair  I spend an absurd amount of money on various things I don't need   Well that's all really, I don't have a job still and I don't have anything to do. At all.

      This is being writen on the 3rd despite my ability to hide it by post dating using blogger... anyway the point is yesterday I decided I would write up the days event the next day, except now I can't remember what happened. Except someone played a game of cricket and I learnt a couple new songs for the bass guitar.

      After yesterdays flourish of excitement, today was in grim contrast - a visit to Yorkshire being the major culprit - I do like Yorkshire, the people, the landscape but some times it can seem so awfully grim and today was one such day - a blanket of fog greeted us in the morning and a blanket of clouds saw us away in the evening and in between it was one of those hot but not hot days - hot but without the fun...  Well you may be able to understand what I mean, you might not... Either way it was an exceedingly dull day.
