      The other night I went to see my friend's band perform.  It was a really good show...the band was tight, and the sound was phenomenal, especially considering it was an outdoor event.  I went with Kate, and while we had a good time, the whole event brought up alot of stuff I've been dealing with lately.  The biggest of these things is the fact that I'm the only one of all the musicians I personally know who isn't working.  Jeff, Justin, Larry, Jay, Will...even Brian is recording, if not playing out.    I could be recording now, but I don't want to get too involved in anything before we leave for vacation in August, because I have a feeling I might come home with some new material.  If I do, then I'd hate to have to compromise any of the work I'd done before.  Then again, if I wait and come back with nothing, then it's alot of time wasted.  Regardless of what I decide to do, I really don't want to do anything until after the American Idol audition.  I swear, it's become an obsession of mine.  I have no doubt at all I could do well in that competition.  I actually intended to audition for this season, but the audition date came and went before I realized it.  I'm not about to let that happen again.  Anyway, so I'm basically just biding my time by writing and tweaking and re-writing and tweaking some more, and I can't help but wonder if it's all in vain.  I mean, I have nothing solid.  I have no real plans or even a timeline to follow.  Everything I'm (not) doing hinges solely on this fucking audition.  If I can make it past the first round--which I'm confident I can--I'll consider it worthwhile.  And if I don't get past round 2, I'll lick my wounds and pick up where I left off.  I'm really trying, though, to find a balance somewhere between wanting it in the worst way and not giving a shit what happens.  It's a hard median to find because while there's nothing lost if I don't advance, there's also so much opportunity if I do.    I better stop thinking about it.  It's giving me a headache.  *sigh*

      I had an idea recently that I thought was a pretty good one:  To take some ABBA tunes and translate them into the style of classic country-western.  I thought I'd start with "Dancing Queen", since it was one the band's biggest hits.  Fuck if it isn't turning out to be a lot more difficult than I thought.  Oh well.  The most challenging quests are always the most rewarding.  But damn you, ABBA, for making music that's so perfect in the first place.  I'm also having to come to terms with a really big decision:  Should I hire a live drummer to record (whenever I finally get around to it), or should I use a drum machine?  I've heard some good sounding drum machines, not knowing it was artificial until afterward.  But I also know some really exceptional drummers.  One I know isn't playing at all anymore, save the occasional jam session or what have you.  Not to mention he's married with a kid--the whole reason he stopped playing in the first place--so his time is precious as it is.  The other guy is already busy in a working band, and might not have any extra time to spare learning new material.  i guess the best thing to do would be to program some drum tracks in advance, then approach each of these guys when the time comes.  That way, if neither can do it, it won't really set me back.  *whew*  See there, just talking it out makes everybig deal seem not so big anymore.  Till next time,

      ...it would probably be a "Ray".  Rays are geometric lines that have a definite beginning point (a) and move in a straight line, in any direction, for an infinite or indeterminate distance.    That's pretty much how I'm feeling about where I stand right now.  I can go from this point in any direction I want to go for an infinite distance/amount of time.  And that's a pretty good feeling to have.  On a quasi-erlated note:  I have a serious obsession, and I'm not sure if it's reached a point of being "dangerous" or not....  I watched American Idol this week like I usually do.  I was suprised by the outcome, but not as much as by how poor the majority of the talent is and has been on that show.  With every passing day, my desire to attempt to earn a place in that competition grows stronger.  Not that I'm cocky or anything, but I  know  I could do well.  Maybe not by my looks, but by my voice, for sure.  I imagine the next auditions will be later in the year, and will probably be held either in Miami or Atlanta or Nashville or somewhere in between.  Fuckin-A, I could tear that show apart.  Just need to make sure I get on it first...

      My name is Rob.  I'm an ordinary joe with an ordinary dream:  To one day be successful as a musician.  It sounds simple enough.  Honestly, it should  be  simple enough.  Ironically, though, it's this business that profits from drama and histrionics that creates so much more than one could ever expect to be entertained by.  As glamourous and exciting the lifestyle of an entertainer may seem while you're watching Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt spend 50k/hour on a massage on the E! channel, it's really just a big pain in the ass.  Seriously, only the truly masochistic put themselves through this kind of a wringer day in and day out.  More than 99% of the people in the entertainment industry make just enough to survive on or less, which means most of us have day and/or night jobs in addition to pursuing our dreams, be it a Broadway star or a trapeze bravado.  I am one of these people.  I work days as a phone jockey for a company that boasts itself as the world leader in scientific and medical publications.  I answer calls from doctors (who charge too much money for doing little more than writing prescriptions for drugs made by companies they have lots of stock in) asking/complaining about the journals they absolutely have to have, all of which are so exorbitantly priced that I now no longer wonder why doctors charge so much.  It's to pay for their fucking magazines.  Hallelujah and capitalism.  I hate my job.  At night, I tinker, I play, I dabble, I sing.  As I sit now, I'm the result of a band whose ambitions far outreached it's motivation to acheive them.  That's right, I'm the ex-musician.  I'm in between jobs, as it were.  And honestly, it's rather refreshing.  For a good three years or so, I was a founder/member of Dear John, a rock band that originated in a small town an hour west of Washington, D.C.  We quickly learned that D.C. was no place for us, so we hightailed it to sunny central Florida, home of Mickey Mouse, and...well, not a whole lot else.  Upon arriving, we quickly made a lot of good friends and a lot of good impressions, and things seemed to be rolling right along.  About 6 months later, a speedbump.  Then a pothole.  Then a sinkhole.  Without going into too much detail, the band dissolved in a manner that was probably a lot more dramatic than needed.  Words were said that hurt people.  Actions were taken that made me question vaious aspects of my life.  But thems the breaks.  That was probably about five or six months ago, and here I still sit, in a much different place than I imagined myself a year ago, but still a better person for all of it none the less.  Where I am now is a good feeling.  I can do what I want, and not really have to worry about filtering my ideas through anyone else for approval.  I can get ideas from friends, associates, strangers, keep the ideas I like and discard the ideas I don't like, all the while not worrying about if I'm hurting anyone's feelings or not.  And there you have my story.  I'm currently writing songs for a long EP (or a short LP, depending on how you wanna look at it).  I don't know when they'll be ready.  I can't even be certain how many songs there will be.  As of now, ballpark of 6-8.  But who knows what I may write tomorrow that I'll want to add to the record.  This is the resource where I'll transcribe my thoughts, feelings, doubts, assurances, plans, successes, failures, or anything else that might come to mind in regards to my pursuit:  The pursuit to make a record that I can respect myself for and that people will enjoy.  In the meantime, I hope you enjoy this account.  Regards,
