      So, I wanted my friends to have access to my journal but at the same time, didn't feel like my political views are something that they would want to see on a day in and day out basis, so, I created a blog. Fun Fun...

      Well, we listened to the entire Kerry speech last night, and it was so nice to listen to an intellect talk to us! OMG it felt normal to listen to a politician again! I was so tired of listening to them babble on about hateful anti-gay banter and Bush rattle on never saying what he's actually going to do. Always making "fear" threats, saying 9/11 everyone goes "aww" and his ratings go up. People are such moronic creatures that they can't stand to sit down, see the good vs. the bad and realize that right now, we don't want this man in office, we need someone who is willing to give Americans their rights, give them back their money if they aren't rich.   So, I make 42K a year, and a I pay over 1,200 taxes a month. I pay over 30% of my money a month in taxes...that's $14,400 a year folks. Now, someone who makes $200,000 a year only pays 7%, guess what that equals out to? $14,000 a year. They make 4 times what I make and instead of paying $56,000 a year in taxes, they pay 1/4 of that. The middle class is being punished, while the upper class is being given money to "supposedly" hire more workers. Give me a fucking break! You think they are going to take their $42,000 extra a year and give someone else a job when they could just increase their own income? Hell no! I'm not stupid, I see it every day, I know better. Voting Republican and giving these people massive tax cuts while the middle class is struggling by is a damn joke.   AND...Bush is trying to do with overtime pay. We pay more in taxes, more in health care and now have less of an opportunity to even make money and the middle class is supposed to vote for a Republican because they have "morals" and want to use their religious belief to control the world? We aren't much fucking different than Islam! No one ever thinks about this though, they just accept the mindless and regurgitated vomit that the media and the president serves them.   I don't want a president I can be "friends" with, I want someone who gives a damn.  What pissed me off most was the fact that the media slammed Kerry and stole his limelight, complained that he came up short on explaining what he would DO in detail to get the job done. He said he's going to lower taxes for the middle class and raise them on people making over 200,000 a year. No problem with me, I won't be making that any time soon. He also proposed environmental protection plans that WORK, and tax cuts for small businesses. They insist there's no way to do that. From what I've read, we have over 400 times more military power than any other country in the world but yet we're still taking money and throwing it into military power. Short of putting a bubble around the country, I'm not sure what you can do. But at any rate, they reamed him for not putting into detail exactly what he would do. Can someone please tell me that BUSH EVER laid into detail his plans for anything? OMG!   I once heard him say well, we've got some stuff planned, yeah, some stuff...and I'm going "and YOU are our PRESIDENT?" The moron won't discuss anything.   He's elected fucking anti-abortion, back woods, queer hating, bible beating justices who he thinks would be "perfect" for the job. HELLO? I think I lost the meaning of PROGRESSION...can someone please tell me what that means?   And then there's this...of which I'm really fucking excited about. At least educated DOCTORS know we're not satan-spawn.  ___________________________  U.S. psychologists favor marriage equality  Thu Jul 29, 8:24 PM ET 	Add Community - Planet Out to My Yahoo!	  Jen Christensen, PlanetOut Network   SUMMARY: The American Psychological Association said it will take a leadership role to help repeal laws that make marriage for gay couples illegal.    	  The American Psychological Association (APA), the largest association of psychologists in the United States, said it will take a leadership role to help repeal laws that make marriage for gay couples illegal.  The group said the fact that gay couples can't marry could psychologically harm the couples and their relationships.  The APA made the announcement Wednesday at its annual convention in Hawaii. In a resolution put together by the Working Group on Same-Sex Families, the group also affirmed its support for gay and lesbian parents.  "The APA recognizes the importance of the institution of civil marriage which confers a social status with important legal benefits, rights and privileges," said psychologist Armand R. Cerbone, chair of the Working Group and a private practitioner in Chicago.  "Discrimination of all kinds takes a toll on people's health and psychological well-being," Cerbone said. "In the context of the huge social and political debate that is currently going on, APA and psychologists had to grapple with the issue of what psychology believes is in the public interest in this controversy."  The resolution counters common arguments used by opponents of legal marriage for same-sex couples -- gay couples don't want long-term relationships, gay relationships are dysfunctional or unhappy, or they're unstable. The resolution cites studies which suggest almost half of gay people are in relationships, many of which are long-term, and that despite the discrimination gay couples face, the number of gay couples who consider themselves happy are about the same as the number of straight couples.  With that basis, the organization said it would take a leadership role to encourage "the repeal of all discriminatory legislation against lesbians and gay men" -- including anti-marriage laws. The resolution also said it would provide educational and scientific research to better inform public discussion and to create better public policy.  The resolution also brought good news for gay parents. The APA found that the parenting abilities of same-sex couples and straight couples were remarkably similar in their effectiveness. The APA concluded that a child's psychological well-being is unrelated to a parent's sexual orientation.  Gay rights organizations, such as the Human Rights Campaign and the Family Pride Coalition, commended the APA for its endorsement of marriage equality.

      Well, the House threw a black blanket over the Supreme Courts' eyes yesterday. Basically now, if someone wants to declare the DOMA is against their constitutional rights, they can't. I'm glad the constitution means so little to them. Imagine what would've happened if they did that with the civil rights issues stating that blacks simply can't take it to court. Nice, really fuckin nice. I want to move out of this country sometimes. We have a bunch of backwoods morons running our country! Why do we even HAVE a fucking constitution!!!! Argh!
