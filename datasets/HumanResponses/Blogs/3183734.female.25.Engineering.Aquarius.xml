      I need my space?!?!?! What the hell kind of statement is that? How are you suppose to respond to that statement? Oh okay honey, here I will move over three feet from you on the couch, is that enough space? Couples go through the most bizarre situations…  See when I hear the words "I need my space" being said between two people who are in a relationship, I think to myself, hmm wow this is not going to be good.   So, the other day I was sitting at this café on 3rd street, minding my own business (only to an extent, you can only do some much alone!) I happen to get lucky, and end up sitting next a couple that was having this SPACE conversation…. So, the conversation starts off peachy and nice… how's your morning, did you hear about Iraq, Lakers, and then all the sudden the bomb drops…  I guess the guy was smart enough to figure out that there was something going on… that is the amazing thing about human beings, they do not always need words, they figure things out by body language or facial expressions, even tone of voice… Okay so lets not get off topic… So he dared to ask, "what's going on honey?" and this girl beat around the bush for about thirty minutes, work, the remodeling of her place, blah blah… and then finally she worked up the courage to say, I need some space!!!! What!?!?! I was thinking…. What does that mean? Okay so, you don’t want me around as much, you think we spend too much time together… oh I am sorry, I thought we were in a committed relationship, where you wanted me to be a part of your life. Yes, I do things on my own, without you, but at the end of the day I want to be vegging out in front of the TV with you, not with my pillow… wow my brain went off on this telling her off phase and then I snapped out of it and thought to myself, SPACE, huh?  I am a creature of loneliness syndrome, and I have been in this conversation… Honestly it sucks if you are not the one who needs the space… see it sucks for these reasons: SPACE, now think about it… SPACE, wow space is so huge… How much of space has the living man discovered, not even 5%… So when a person is using a word like SPACE, what are they trying to tell you?   See for me, being in the same space but doing two different things, is having my own time… I can be sitting at the kitchen table writing a letter, reading a book or doing anything else, while my other half can be sitting in the family room watching the game, or playing video games, or whatever and respecting each other's space… but for some people being in the same physical space, means crowding their personal space… I think that is just funny… I mean we are all in the same SPACE! Think about it, we all live on earth, oh would you like me to leave earth so you can have your SPACE?!?!  I think people should stop using the word SPACE… its too broad… its too much for another individual who's world is probably as big as the space they are standing in at the moment to comprehend the statement "I need my SPACE!"

      Life has such a funny way of working out. Remember that Seinfeld episode where Jerry evened out on everything. His life played out like in a way as if he came up with the equilibrium theory. I feel as if every human being's life plays out in similar ways, but not as simple as Jerry's did. See I think the equilibrium in REAL life plays out in different degree levels… Now let me explain:   See there are a lot of people out there who live their life's allowing Karma to run and rule them. Karma you ask? What is karma? Karma is that funny little thought, feeling, fear that arises in you when you do something that you know has crossed your moral line. You make fun of an over weight person walking down the street, your first thought after the laughter, or comment is made, may be "oh man my KARMA is screwed." See if you truly laughed at this person's misery, then Karma will get you, but not in a simple way. You would think because you made fun of an over weight person, you might gain weight now, or something simple as such… But see karma is not that easy… It should get you when you don’t see it coming. Maybe you marry a perfectly healthy person, but then eventually they start slipping in the way they look, and five years into the marriage this person is titled as an obese person… Maybe your children will have an eating disorder, where they can not get enough of what is being served that night for dinner, and they just want more, maybe your old faithful (your dog) will not chase after the ball you throw but rather lethargically walk over to it. There are so many ways Karma can get you and these are just some of different degrees of ways…  See, I never used to buy into those moments of weakness… I always thought that I was in control of my life, I know the outcome of my actions because I am in the driver seat here… But I think what I failed to realize was, there are so many forces of nature around me at any given time in the day and I do not control those. I can only control what I do… I can not control the air, the water, the person standing next me, the traffic, the bug flying straight into my windshield… I believe with all these other forces working, trying to run from their karma, everyone is in for it. See, karma is like a domino effect… It started off with one atom, laughing or commenting at another atom's expense and then the theory exploded and now everyone, everything, heck every atom has gotten their share of KARMA…  BE AWARE KARMA WILL GET YOU BEFORE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TURN AROUND AND SEE IT COMING AND DON’T TRY TO RUN BECAUSE IT FINDS IT'S WAY INTO YOUR PERFECT LIFE!!!  HAHAHA….  This post is strictly for entertainment purposes.  Thank you.

          What is the longest hour during the 8-hour workday?  It has to be from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. I don't ever get anything done during this hour and it seems to me like this is the longest hour ever!

      Oh,  If I could only tell you how much pain she puts me through. I am there day and night to support her. I take her where ever she wants to go. I suffer through the endless nights of no attention but nothing holds me back, I am there for her 100%. So then why, why I ask, do you think she did this to me? Why do you think she wants me to suffer? Have I not been loyal enough? Have I not performed to her level of expectation?  I sit here in utter pain wondering when this maddness will end. My poor soul uncomfortably confined to this area. I remember those days when I smelled the beautiful air, saw the beautiful sights as my bottom rubbed against the oh so soft fabric. How bitter I feel now, to have all of me squished together in a pointy corner, no room to breathe, no air vents to have fresh air, and where sight is nothing more than a dream. How these turn of events happened is beyond my recollection. How I long for those carefree days, those days when I was snuggled in the soft fabric only to be protected by the strong leather.  Tell her I need her, Tell her I love her, Tell her I will leave her if she doesn't get me out of these uncomfortable shoes!  -Anju's Feet
