      meh, I got 3 hours till hockey. ill try to sum this stuff up: 1. first week, orono fair 2. new classes new peeps, university fair  1. well in the summer hmmm i gotta job at IGA, in the deli. went to Summer Sanitarium, SarsStock and hit justin timberlake with a water bottle! soon after on somethin unrelated my site was shutdown...as well as my blog. First week of schools means hitting on the new girls, initating 9ers (shampooed a few with soap from the washroom) but most of all the orono fair. this year me and jewlz (julie) went 2gether and met up with groups from both schools there. eventually i won her a stuffed somethin and we were accordin to me, her and a few carnies boyfriend and girlfriend for the night, and we chilled without getting drunk unlike a few of our friends  2. started the year off with spare, calculus, biology, lunch and gym but i added a geometry class for spare and eventually got the highest mark on that exam ever (93%). new VP replaced Joly, and is actually worse then Joly. his name is Majidell and I don't even think the teacher's like him. so im in gr12 now, guess that means next year is university, so i was convinced by my rents to go the university fair in the t.dot. definitely worth it, me and bobby went, got sooo much free shit, and decided since we were asian and they were racist certain stands did give us free shit by leaving it there cough *backpacks* cough *binders* s'alll good. we walked around the t.dot for awhile and then twas over. oh yah, new neighbour named Ryan in grade 10 at ma school, and its like since my rents are loaded i will occasionally come home from school and find a note saying, "Went to  blank , be back  blank ." This was the case near the end of september, after school I go home and find a note sayin "Went to  Cancun , be back  in 3 weeks ." You gotta understand this is normal, and who am I to argue? I got a car for 3 weeks, so I drove to school everyday and on the last day even gased her up! note: my rents did phone home occasionally so it wasnt like they just left me on my own, they let a few hundred for food

       music: D12 - my band  although i find that song both insulting and prejudice its sorta alright cause Bizarre and Obie don't seem to mind. anyway lots of shit been happening. try to sum-it-up. hockey we tied and are goin to the A finals monday night in the n.dot at 10pm. Wednesday = funness, trevor and natalie were actually at school 2day cause of inclass co-op so we went on lunch adventures. first the 8 of us, trevor, graham, lee and me plus natalie, lisa, amber and dina went to pizza pizza and got free pizza yeaahh. then we drove around and came back cause trevor, graham, dina and amber had class. then me, natale, lisa and lee drove around in natalies car and went everywhere, a flea market, the mall, katie's house, 7-11 where i got some new sunglasses, and other places it was a good time. thursday was the 3rd day that all of a sudden prom tickets were on sale which makes me really stressing right now because I don't know who I'm gonna take. theres this alisha girl ive been chillin with l8tly, she goes to clarke. then awhile ago i was thinkin of asking leanne who goes to durham college, but i really wanna ask this aleks girl who is like the girl I really wanna go with but things have been weird since Devons party. i worked 4-8 thursday and it was guy's night at the iga, not one female worker or manager or supervisor in every department, thats the 3rd time ever thats happened since i started seeing as we only have 3 male cashiers, and only one of them knows how to work customer service. Joe (bakery manager) wanted to join the Hell-Ziggas, which is our crew of the ethnics (haha and sum white ppl) of the IGA but no...     That's my crap school...where I have to go do everything. And now my sports life and after school life is totally fucked. Rugby = supposedly no spring season, so I spend 70bucks on a lacrosse stick and am now committed to that. figure ill join track n field on the side and now rugby is back up and i sorta have to join that so since IM CAPTAIN IF I DO! ha first asian captain cept my brother...anyway normally i could handle this since hockey is over. 3sports was done b4 (bball, hockey n rugby) but ontop of those 3 yearbook is having more and more meetings and work is getting more and more shifts. so my afterschool life is depleting in time. 2day i refereed my last 2 games of ever i think since hockey is over after next week and im not reffing next week or next year. friday=2 parties and lots of herb, and i really need to go to the bank soon...i only got 48 dollas in ma hands yo. this morning is gonna be harsh, i gotta really bad hangover and i needa make it to my hockey bosses' house to get my March Cheque, deposit that with my February cheque in the bank and then see my balance and withdraw a couple hundred, then try to work a 1-7 and possibly see Taking Lives with Alisha after but itll be harsh. ahhh i need a cappuccinno...

Monday I walked into data management and my teacher tried to flip out on me saying I was late and I'm like fine I quit your class then and whipped my book on the desk making it slide all the way to the end then fall off. note: i walked into guidance after and officially dropped the course like a month after the deadline haha but i explained it to them and they was cool.   2day was brutal, well the afternoon. religion we went to the chapel and meditated, then in english jus a work period and lunch at the whopper but 4th period i remembered i hadda shitload of chemistry due and hadda do that and realized i missed the lacrosse meeting which was important and i was told theres a practice/meeting thursday now. chemistry i thought i was gonna be late and i jumped in just as the bell ringed only to realize i forgot we hadda class in the library 2day and was late afterall... i went to the track n field meeting and got yelled at for being late for yearbook after but i wowed every1 by solving the problems with, well all their problems and then on the ride home chilled with jess, jenna, meghan, jared, aly and whitney and busted out the g-bag for some yellowcard. not like a second after i got off the bus did my stupid phone ring and my mom was like i coulda given you a ride home and im like yeaah thanks for telling me now and hung up cause she said she was gonna be late so how am i suppose to know she coulda given me a ride home. find out alisha called and then hadda cancel cause i got 2projects due and hockey 2nite after my longass suspension which was gonna go to the end of the year but isnt anymore so yah!

       music: linkin park - step up  this break was different...on the hmmm 16th i talked to katelynn on the phone for awhile, we had a long talk about life and shit. wednesday i worked a 4-9 as my last shift for the break and felt bored so i went all-out for the close since it wasnt busy. thursday i got woken up by alisha, who i accidently hung up on cause i figured it was a random white telemarketer. then she phoned again around 2 and she said her and her friend were comin over so im like whatever, hadda shower and got some mcdonalds then they came over. we played pool and watched Freddy vs. Jason on the satellite, then walked to IGA to get my hours. ahhh there was stupid shit there cause i was scheduled to work sunday even though i was told id have it off (id be in BC where i am now) and i had the joy of phoning my boss at home.   the plane ride was pretty cool, GRIND was one of the movies followed by a cartoon of the Pink Panther which I haven't seen in sooo long, still not funny. Taxed some airplane peanuts as well as some airport crap ill prolly throw in the useless box when i get home. watchin that though reminded me of back in the day, when I started high school. Linkin Park's song Step Up was the shit when they just came out, it was cool to take the GoBus and mp3's were the new thing. Shit has changed in the last 4 years. I remember getting the tour of High School as it'd be the next 4 years of my life, as I got the tour of UBC where I'm gonna spend the NEXTEST 4 years of my life.      That's just the library at UBC, and it's sooo sweet. There's a restuaraunt in a library, and there's malls on campus and it's also in the middle of Vancouver so whenever i want, Hooters, Bars, Casinos and Grocery stores (pointless fun). It's been a while since my last blog, like 4 days so I'm just rambling on. my cousins have been pretty cool, and BC is still awesome. Cept for a few clouds in the morning the weather is like Florida, and yes they have Bacon McFlurry's down here. Be back Sundayish.

      let the parties begin (stole that line from 2fast 2furious). well thursday marked the start of the march break, and after school me and ma neighbour ryan went to purchase some stuff, then i had a decision. either jordan from clarke's party, dave sharpe from bhs's party, or meghan saari from ssss's party. well i knew meghan the bestest so thats where it was at, but i hadda work 2day so i tried not to do anything too stupid. bein the idiot i am i ended up takin my rents nonalcoholic beer but at least i was high and smoked up wit 3 other ppl. at around two me and lee were gonna get goin home cause he was stayin over but meghan figured it'd be alright if we both stayed over, but i didnt wanna get grounded again so i did some baked walking home-ness. couldn't really walk straight, and at 2 in the mornin i wasnt feelin at my best and then this car pulled up and i thought there was gonne be a fight, but it was jus mike. him and his peeps were goin to get some more beer for sharpie's, so i went back with them. then around i think 4 in the morning i somehow ended up having a sword fight with poolsticks against this really hot katie girl from bhs, and she stabbed me in the chin and it bled like a mother fucker, but its alright now. got some sober ppl to drop me off at the gobus station and waited there from 7:30-7:50 around and a bus came, got dropped off in the n.dot and snuck into the house JUSSS b4 my rents woke up and checked on me. then i actually fell asleep and woke up a few minutes ago. ahhh..gotta shower, get some mcdonalds then im off ta work

DM and chem were easy, but after school it was weird. did a session with cull and his cousin and i hadda work after, not that good. but when i got home i gotta msg from dina which was because of personal stuff pretty much saying, after me calling her back, our relationship is over. but thas okay cause in the earth there's a balance and it jus so happens that at work today me and the new girl alisha flirted hardcore which was all dina was, a flirt, so its okay it all works out.

       music: DMX - Party Up  so today was full of unexpected shit. started off the day by playin matchmaker between a clarkie and a preppie, names not said due to requestedness. after first period the whole school went to the gym for a surprise EXTRA-CURRICULAR HONOURS ASSEMBLY! boo-yah, check out all these AwArDs: hockey, lacrosse, rugby, yearbook, debating, track n field and something im ashamed to be a part of so i wont mention dot dot dot at lunch we fit 6 ppl into devons mini red car, it was tight, literally but it was funny. i got the bacon mcflurry again, it was awesome. in data management we found out there is gonna be a fucking homework check 2morrow which fucking sucks because i havent had a homework check in like 2 years. i never do the homework, and just get like 100% on all the tests, the work is pointless if i know how to do it so now i have to do all the work up to now for marks which is ridiculous. in chemistry schollard was away so the supply took us the library where i played the new girl (Lena) who has a kickass German-Italian-French accent, more Italian-French shes awesome and hot, ah-hem played her in dots which is this game where u try to make a square complete its complicated but anyway that was last period. i contemplated going to yearbook or not because of my supposed thing with this girl in there but instead i went home then to work right after where i chilled w/ da clarkies michelle and mike w/ some story swapping. now i gotta bullshit some work..damnit...

       music: 8 mile road - jin  explained all that stuff finally, so todays blog is the first actual blog of my new blog. hmmm well i brought this stuff for english today, glowstick swords which is for this english presentation of hamlet my group is goin totally original for. in religion half our class was at the t.dot trip which i couldnt be on cause of an chemistry test, and so we had two religion classes joined together. our teacher said ppl if they wanted could stay in class or go to the chapel or library, so me, michelle and her friend went to mcdonalds. got the bacon mcmuffin obviously, and then when we got back no1 was in the library or chapel, and after askin around it turned out the teacher flipped cause no1 was working and made every1 go back to class. we almost got in shit but i phoned brett and asked him to get the teacher to photocopy an assignment he didnt really lose, then we slipped in.  in english i was the only person in my group there (t.dot trip and sickness) and pretty much dicked around the whole class jumping out the window with people and racing down the portopac hallway on those chairs with wheels. lunch..detention for bein late the day before but i raped the test i had in data management, the only 100% (boo-yah) and chemistry was also a breeze. nobody besides the asian kid and a few of his friends in chemistry were ready for either test which was funny cause in data management i got done after like 8.5 minutes and the teach lemme chill on the roof till every1 else was done. COULD be goin to Vibe tonight with a bunch of ppl but stupidass grounding-ness is in effect still. and The O.C. isnt even on tonight, either is Forever Eden so this is so stupid, ahhh i need weed :D

(she like never drinks), then the next day, a bunch of us went to mcdonalds and i put bacon in my orange juice and hashbrowns, and we drove home. slept till hmmm...well we got home at 3 and i slept till 8, then woke up and carolyn picked me up to go to lindsey's party in the shwa. highlights including smokin up ever more, splitting a whole bottle of crown royal with some sarah chick and even more hookups. PS: valentines also happened and i got jess some candy in a heart shaped case  10. so the details, well lindsey had the party friddaayy and before it ended (around 3-4ish) she told me and carolyn she was having another one, well she pretty much jus told carolyn cause i didnt know her the 1st friday, 2nd and right now i dont even know her last name but shes cool and hot. !!!!!!!!!!!!! well the pre-party was me having to stay after school for detention then rushing to work a 4-9:30 at work and then carolyn yelling at me cause i wasnt changed? went to my house and i got changed then we left but not before my rents yelled at me for stupid chores that i couldnt possibly have done since i went to work right after school so i was pissed off. oh and at the time i was suspended from hockey for nailin some kid and knocking his helment off him from the impact sooo soon as we got there i hit the beers, challenged some white kids to weed smoke offs and beat em all, and by 12 i was sick of drinking and smoking so i went to the basement dance area. carolyn was there and i meant to try and lean on her cause i was losing my balance but i ended up huggin her and then we slowdanced lol and i remember that, and then i woke up on the patio at 1am. see the first ever post for details after that (details being i got driven home by carolyn and rents found out and thats why im grounded).

      music: NERD - rockstar poser  where to begin. life's a bitch. wednesday wednesday wednesday. umm... i did something stupid at school again, you can all guess what that was. moving on. thursday i stayed after school to find out lacrosse was cancelled (grrreeaatt) and was gonna wait a whole fucking hour for the latebus but luckily andrew vyfschaft showed up outta nowhere and gave me a ride home. havent seen that guy in so long since he quit high school, wonder how amandas doin. friday I hadda dilemma cause lacrosse and rugby were at the end of the day. I got dismissed from chem and was like yah okay im at rugby from 1 until 2 and then at 2 im gone for lacrosse so i wont be coming back so yah. in rugby we faced eastdale, the all ontario champions with pretty much the whole school watching. fun shit, friend of mine dave got knocked unconcious and was taken away and this was like not even 2meters away from me. I felt like shit though cause the end of the game was delayed and I told jean-marc to tell the coach I left for lacrosse but I mean I feel like an ass for just leaving but I had an obligation to lacrosse. chased the lacrosse bus in my rugby uniform, and in rugby we lost but in lacrosse we won oh yah. got picked up and then yelled at for not having my cell phone on from my dad. saturday i worked with the hot kimmy who was away in the t.dot for like ever. sunday i worked my last shift ever with ian since hes got a fulltime job in the s.dot (scarborough). I just hadda lotta shit on my mind yesterday so I phoned katelynn and she helped me work things out, she's cool.  and outta nowhere a while ago I decided to blog because I remembered some time near the end of grade 11 a shitload of us went to the lateshow after this party got busted and we were all kinda high / drunk and we left through the backdoor of the cineplex and all stole one of those child booster seats, set off the alarm, were chased, got in the van and drove back to the n.dot without being caught AND we used those stupid child booster seats as toboggans for "the hill" in newcastle which is right by the n.dot arena. yes. drunk and high. stole child booster seats. used em as toboggans. it was winter and it was grade 11. :D.   and finally a daydream I had at work today while in the breakroom. for some reason I was goin to all these really kickass randy-river type stores cept they were locations like the future-shop. I was with one person and I decided finally to buy this kickass brown-vest-sweater-sweatshirt thing that was like a jersey but wasnt and then suddenley im with like 12 friends. and we get on this weird bus where theres like 4rows. the driver is in the 1st row, 2 people in those green holycross uniforms are in the 2nd row joined by two of the 12 of my friends. ten of my friends sit in 9 of the seats in the 3rd row but instead of taking the last spot I take a spot in the back next to this girl who has a green uniform on and im like hey can I sit here and shes like haha no just joking yes then she puts her arm around me and every1 turns around and they are like cheering for me and then I put my arm around her and then i fucking wake up cause im being called to the deli on the PA cause i fuckin spent too long on my break. she was hot though...

      music: billy talent - try honesty/the river below remix  who ever made that combo song i give props to, its not piece of crap collaboration like limp bizkit's just like this/n2gether now. anyway this past week was the week of extensions. instead of havin 3 ISUs due monday, WHILE i was at St. Catharines for Lacrosse, Lacrosse helped me out. Thanks to the all-winning undefeated team going to the All-Ontarios which I be part of, my chemistry teacher decided to extend our ISUs due date an extra day because 5 of us were in that class and would all be gone. Following the trend lacrosse did the same for english which also had 5 players. and then religion, well in the middle of discussing the ISU i raised my hand, and mind you we only had 2 lacrosse players in religion, explained what had happened in my other 2 classes and bam extension in the hizzle fo shizzle. chemistry was the gate to the others, but we pretty much said yo this is the first ever st. stephens team that has had an undefeated season, and we are the first ever lacrosse players for st.stephens. on top of that this school hasnt won an all-ontario championship (WON, not been in the finals for) for like 3 years. We were like yo you want us to give up the gold for some paper, than its your fault so bam.  thats just so fucking awesome. chemistry=tuesday 5pm, religion=friday and english=thursday. brutally we gotta be at the school at 5:45am but s'all good. for my english ISU presentation I'm the first to present cause were going in 'reverse alphabetical order' seeing as all the presentations up to now have been in alphabetical order. I got into Guelph, McMaster and Brock, but I already know where I'm going :D. On top of that Kathleen is my prom date now, asked her Friday Night (last night) so yeaah. ummmm, yo what else. gotta buy some disposable cameras, and bah iga.   me being the idiot I am forgot to book off June 11th (PROM). i hadda beg sum1 to take it for me which led to me taking their shift 2morrow (8-1) on top of my shift (1-6) so yeah I am working 8am-6pm tomorrow. Open till close. lucky me. 10 hours of work. now Im not even sure if I'm working saturday the 12th or not and if i am i gotta make a mad transition from hung over/high over to work mode, because after work I gotta drive up to one of 3 cottages that every1 else will be working at. and sunday, well, same shit if im working. if i could quit work that would be the bomb, but residence fees and all that shit is due soon and I would feel like an ass if I made my parents pay for 100% of it.   now outside of school/work lets see. last post was umm tuesday. leave for blink 182 [2nd row] soon as im done this. for some reason i think ill be driving/be getting driven from toronto directly to work as a result of high/hang overs. i dunno wear to buy a croissage. monday is gonna be mint. i gotta buy some more cameras for prom and st. catharines, as itll be my last high school outing EVER. holy shit, fucking basketball, hockey, rugby, a little track n field, student council, debating, yearbook, and more from grade 9-12. and now it all ends with my first ever and the schools first ever all-ontario OFSAA win since i was in grade 8. 3 WEEKS AND IM OUT!!!

       music: staind - so far away   thursday was mint. religion and english were bird classes, movie in each and i went through the rest of the day knowing I had a 3 day weekend. Friday was the lacrosse tourney, the only bad part was getting to the school at 6:45am (no1 can drive that early, even white people have a hard time opening their eyes all the way nevermind me lol) but it was done. beat kenner in our first game, we played on the 'island field'. didnt think it was gonna actually be an island when we got there but it was literally a field surrounded by like 4-5 meter pond-age. we crossed a rope bridge and it was good times. second game we played agin court and beat em making our undefeated record 10-0. (yah, double digits).   after that we figured we'd go to town [literally]. i got one of those damn step-o-meters at mcdonalds which i am still playing with (16, 457 steps and still goin) and while there the team hit on a lovely group of ladies at mcdonalds. the day was crazy hit-ons. i tried not to hit cause of the amazin n.dot girls and how things are goin, but my only one was by accident. savoie, demille and perron were hittin pretty good though. anyway before our third game me and tom were tossin the rock back and fourth and it rolled down the hill so im all ill go get it, and our crew was chillin at the top of the hill in lawn chairs and lyin against their lacrosse bags and then every1s like wu's goin to hit. i didnt realize the rock rolled right by these gorgeous girls watchin a game on the other field and i wasnt gonna hit on em, but then i THOUGHT one of em was my friend amanda carepellucci and im like yo sexy is that you? and she turned around and it wasnt her but she like smiled and was like oh so u think im sexy eh? and i couldnt really say no to diss her and they all started talkin to me but that was that.  so here's how shit happened. we are a B-division team. we have so far only played max b divison teams, and it was obvious we were gonna smoke peryma because we already beat them in league play. then there's the A Finals where St. Petes (also undefeated, except their streak goes back 6years) was gonna smoke who ever they were gonna face. so we switched spots with their opponents. first loss ever. that's all ill say. disappointment? yes. oh well. i was pissed and so i couldnt wait to get loaded at culls later that night and then alishas after. nate and lee picked me up around 8 and i told em to stop by iga so i could get some chasers. rachel was workin, think i hit on her and thats all i really member from that night. i was the big winner at texas hole-em poker and we went to do some drunk walkin around in the n.dot and were gonna fight so many ppl but it was just brutal.   saturday mornin was breakfast with the family seein as we're all here now. went to this cool mall but didnt get anything. worked 2-7 and think, yah i did go out with alisha after. sunday was work and then hardcore homework catching up. monday i found out all the shit i missed friday. i hadda do a lab in chem and my isu is due soon. in english my TWO isus are due soon. religion my isu is due soon plus we gotta new book to read. luckily there's spare, yay.

       music: staind - so far away   guess ill explain that last post. -dad flipped cause i took the car with a G1, even though he LET my brother do it this exact time last year before he got his G2. favouritism obviously seeing as my bro CRASHED and still didnt get in shit meanwhile my dad even said im a good driver. -my school fucking sent in the wrong midterm marks for university for 2 out of 3 of my classes so because of a stupid idiot like on Orange County I might not get in [*shes trying at least*] -too much conflict in my life right now, this along with small things like my bank account being too low -me and my prom date aleks got in this whole thing and she wanted to just go as friends so now we arent going to prom together anymore -i fucking bet 50 bucks philly would win in 4, and the leafs fucking pulled an upset victory...  lacrosse and rugby i love. why? because when im totally pissed off with some stupid bitch or some fuckign asshole in lacrosse i can just wack some mother fucking with my stick. similarly in rugby a guy doesnt even have to have the ball and I can go tackle his ass. hey, its better than anger management at a fraction of the cost (bus rides that assist me in missing class).

Funnest shit ever.. before the chem exam I brought my photo album to exchange doubles with ppl and every1 membered their pics cept cally... but anyway after exams trev picked me up and we went to clarke to get julie. i was the cool kid walkin through clarke in my school uniform.. usually I know ahead of time to get a change of clothin but fuck it I was done with school and didnt care. me and julie changed in the n.dot and then we picked up trudi and off to wonderland it was. craziest ass time ever, the whole way there trev took the backroads and we just joked about the funniest shit that happened between the four of us and how all four of us actually knew people the other people did through *connections*  day pass was fuckin $54.00 and a seasons pass was $99.93 so i jus got that instead. awww the day was so awesome like tha water park, cliffhanger, birds eatin my entire funnel cake, jus everything. oh, so me and trevor go to hit up some rides on our own for a bit and the girls (julie and trudi) are gonna play some games and buy some stuff, i give her 20 bucks to buy a 15 dollar spray=paint=hat that u can get whatever u want on it. i tell her she can have the extra 5 bucks if she remembers to get them to write WUFU on it (my lacrosse nickname). then theres trevor in the car who on the way there tells her how at the start of the lacrosse season after one of my goals or assists they said matt TOFU wong-fung instead of WUWU. yah so we meet up at tomb raider, and she friggin gets TOFU written on it instead of WUWU...wow 15 bucks thanks alot julie lol i mean the four of us thought it was funny for the first hour but I mean it was my hat for the day cause the water rides drenched my spiked hair and it said tofu on it. other highlights include me havin to empty every single thing in my pockets cause of the stupid new metal detectors which are useless. okay so after the first beep I say it's my camera so i throw the camera case in the bucket and he doesnt even open it, THERE COULDA BEEN A WEAPON IN THERE... then my phone, wallet, coins, and packet of gum which once again he didnt open. so they ask u to put stuff on the table but dont even look at it.. cool. eve 6 - inside out is ma new song, it was blarin on the way to wonderland and @ wonderland. saw dave and vanessa there among other ppl and it was jus a sick day. got back around 10:30pm, i coulda went drinkin but i was tired as shit and drinkin is for thursday night.   yesterday was recovery time, i slept till 5pm in acceptance that school is finally over. actually got out of bed at 7pm and ordered a big foot which was breakfast, bruch, lunch, and dinner. today I did something I havent done in a couple weeks, I took a walk. around all of newcastle pretty much, saw like everyone and got offered rides by like 6 of my friends in groups of cars seperately but I jus said I was gettin some air and they all thought i was sobering up, but it was just to check out good ol' newcastle. in august im out, at university. Roselina's, Captain George's, Mike's, Mac's, Piggly Wiggly's, all the old hang out places from St. Francis. then there was the St. Francis kids who didnt have a care in the world, at 'recess' they didnt have to worry about grades or moving out or anything they just chilled and squirted eachother with water guns which was cool in a funny way.   then there's 2morrow... graduation. the whole 'grudges' thing ill explain now. not really a grudge, I mean i cleaned up all my other lil rivalries. me and trevor english are cool from that whole hockey hate thing. same with me and darryl since he got a job at the deli. me and chris are cool now, we chilled at prom. and everyone i'd ever fought im cool with. girls, well me and trudi are alright, same with me and erin. me and dina are cool now which is awesome, but then there's her... not the clarke her, the ssss her, heather. im hopin at some point before or after, or at the after-party I can just talk to her and tell her Im sorry about how things have been but that I dont hate her. Just, after we broke up I dont know why but I gave her the cold-treatment even though I've always been really cool and even really good friends with my ex's. me and heather were cool for a bit, but then lately I just been ignoring her and i dont know why. for graduation i start the mofo off, im the cross bearer and part MC, and then i end it. i *THINK* im gettin a few rewards, lacrosse, geometry, religion and possibly rugby. one day... its so close. but now I gotta get some mcdonalds and go to my crappy job...peace out

       music: seether feat. amy lee - broken   past few days kinda summed up my whole school year with a different mode. cool party (lisa's), met a girl from a different school that i flirted with (nadine), got in shit from my parents who i hate again because i supposedly didnt tell them i was sleeping over at lisa's. missed a trifecto of parties thursday night cause i missed rides to two of them to go to the 3rd one but julie and clarkie were drunk and werent even answerin their cell phones...bastards lol but then clarkie invited me to his girlfriends party so it was s'all good. plus he gave me some advice on ashley from work.  lisa's present was a scooby doo dogg from wonderland that i won, and 2morrow im droppin off julies gift before work which is well if ur readin this judi then nice try. it sucks though since im workin 4-9, and can't book it off so im missin julie's dinner birthday at the mandarin BUT HAVE FUN GIRL! ill miss ya ;)  nadine it was weird. every1, or most ppl there knew i liked her cause as soon as i got there we jus flirted hardcore and then i found out i talked to her on the phone one time (after the weed and alcohol kicked in) and then we planned a date but she has a boyfriend and i have a girlfriend and we kissed but i mean bacon. plus it sucks cause there is an age gap, but she's just so awesome though.

       Music: White Dawg & Lil Flip - Game   probably one of the longest blogs ever but thats only potentially if that makes sense. its been a while since my last blog, posting a picture a week after my last ACTUAL blog doesn't really count I don't think. So since July 11th, this has been like complicated shit.  Well for starters there's the girl count. Zero. FOR NOW! I tried four at once, didn't work out. Me and Nadine just that wasn't working out, Alisha found out about her and then that ended so even though she wanted to give it another try I didnt wanna end up doin the same thing a week later so I just ended it. Ashley from work after are first outside of work get together found out about not nadine, not alisha but another girl Rachel and that ended before it started. Me and Rachel, we both like eachother (pretty sure) but right before we're good she tells me her parents will never let her have a boyfriend until she's done high school, and seein as she has another year left that's too long a wait. I'm 100% sure she wasnt lying because when we started chillin and hangin out her girl friends told me I was wasting my time because she isn't allowed to have a boyfriend, so yah.  Bunch of parties, best was probably this one in oshawa at my friend carolyn's house. she hadda band, that was the second party where there's actually been a live band. mind you no one ever heard of em accept for the friends of the band but they hadda pretty sick billy talent vibe goin. there was a kegger too and me and the original kim, kim walker are good now. she started workin at my work iga and we're cool again.  end of august, the newcastle iga's deli is, in one way or another, screwed. That's because the quote on quote '6-Pack' is leaving. It was originally the 8-Pack. 7 before I came, but when I arrived there was 4 girls and 4 guys. Kimmy H., Michelle Henderson, Jenn Woodcock and Marie Bumstead, then there's Kevin Ladoceur, Mike Sharpe, Ian Williamson and the new guy (Wong-Fung). For literally like 5 months I WAS the new guy, then at Christmas some more people got hired. During that period however Marie left to live with her boyfriend, and it was the 7-Pack. Ian eventually left because he gotta job in the s.dot (scarborough) and it became the 6-pack. the iga deli switched managers, and every single new person from christmas to may either got fired or quit. 5 newbies, alisha (one of my ex's), sheri (the one who told her i cheated on her), darryl, alan, and matt bowman. There's two parts of our Deli, the actual Meat Part called Deli or Cold Food, and the salads/prepared food part called Hot Food. People are trained on cold food before they can train on hot food. At the end of august starting with this friday, every single member of the 6-pack will be leaving. Kevin is moving to Ottawa, Kim has a job in Toronto at a lawfirm, Jenn has a job in Toronto at special fx makeup place, Sharpie is gettin another job, Michelle is goin to college and I of course am goin to university. Well I was a fast learner and the only one too learn hot food in one month flat,  out of the new 5 let's see Alan kind of knows how. Out of the 6 leaving we all knew both sections, and when we leave unless they can teach Alan to work 7 nights a week they are screwed.  speaking of work, I hate annoying customers. This one woman comes up, asks for like a shitload of chicken wings, I tell her it'll cost alot but she persists so I price em and give em to her. she comes back and says she doesnt have enough money but she'll come back. an hour passes, then 2 hours so I put em with the rest of the wings and they eventually get sold. she comes back and I tell her they're gone and she starts flipping out. Then she decides to get the bakery manager who tells her its not my fault and then she thinks we are all against her and runs out in a rampage.   met some university people in the same program as me on the message boards. got my meal plan and all that ready and I cant wait for move in day (september 5th). frosh week is gonna be so sick, at work michelle is like wong-fung at university you're gonna be such a pimp and i'm like 'yahhhh, i know' smilin like hardcore. i helped sarah close bakery tonight and when i was tellin her about my 'outings' last week with leanne and kimmy #7, she agreed 'wong-fung you'll be a major pimp at university' so i just smiled.  got a new everything, mini-fridge, boom box, lol and a bunch of lil stuff like an electric tootbrush, gel bottles, tissue boxes, binders and all that. this month better go by fast, but at the same time I want to meet a girl and have a meaningful relationship with a mutual breakup in the period of 3 weeks, that'd be so sweet.  august 14th is the birthday, but it'd be cool if me and leanne just chilled in the day because at night I'm goin to this surpise party for my friend x who may be reading this. it isnt even a birthday surprise party its for something they did or will do thats so worth it. my bro is goin out that day anyway and i think my rents are working so we cant do a family thing.  oh, and jess, if ur reading this, i finally did a real post ( boo-yah in yo face, but u still hot ;) )
