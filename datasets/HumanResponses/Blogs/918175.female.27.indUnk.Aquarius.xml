       Panaghuy   Bakit ka umiiyak? Bawat patak ng luha mo’y Nilusaw ang liwanag  hatid ng nag iisang bituin  Ng langit ba ika mo?  Marapat bang sabayan  Ng maka lumang lab song Ang bawat hagulhol ng puso?  Malungkot ka ba? Bakit me bahagyang kislap ang ... Teka, ‘kaw ba ay nangiti? Inagos na ba ng luha ang nakakamatay  Mong pighati?  uMiyak ka pa.

      finally! the sun's up with a smile. not too much and it still is windy but at least we got a rest from the rain.  ***  PUNDOKTINYO's moderator (my former editor from my college student publication ATENEWS) actually got me in the group's mailing list. It's  a writers group for atenews alumni so we can all get together and touch base at least while online.  -MiSael   so while the moderator's now on the hunt for other members, i'm creating a photo album..i just wanna share to them all people what i've been busy with after college.

      what do you do with all the gift certificates for a first class gym?? spend 2 hours in the sauna! huh! it was so great i could feel my sweat ran from my armpit to my legs..oh la la la!  the shower room have it's own shampoo/conditioner and body wash. the shower was so great i felt my skin dry up for spending too much time washing.   the locker room was not crowded that  sunday afternoon so i had the mid section all to myself. what with the large mirrors and hair blowers and AC on, it was sooooOOoo tempting to walk around butt naked.   the gym itself was fantastic. first, they have all types of soda and iced drinks free bottomless! huh! then the lounge area was loittered with ahemm..handsome pretty young men. mwehehehhe. deceiving young men oggling at other young men bwuahahaha! at least they've got the bod and the looks to at least feast at.   second, the machines looked monstrous. you'd think that after using them for a bit ten minutes, you'll have all the muscles toned up in places you've always dreamed of toning..like your ahem..chin? but then again, this person next to you catching his breath lifting a 50 lbs 'monster' is himself breath-catching.   i'll be back wednesday to attend to their group classes. got to decide from yoga, pilates, body balancing, body stressing, how about body undressing? huwaw!  i will never question, never again, why people with so much money could pay P3600 a month for a fitness program. and spend hours in the gym. i mean .. and spend hours in the gym.

      my sister resigned from work and moved out of her house to live in with my Mom. she set a one-month period to trim down her weight. all this for her application to japan. she wants to work in japan as an entertainer. (set aside moral issues, that would be another harbored topic)  she's only 25 and she wants to be financially able by the age 30. and so japan, she sees is the answer to all her wants and needs.   then there is also korea. if she opts for korea, she will then have to apply as an english teacher. since korean entertainers earn as much as tutors. (whatever!)   the bad news is, if she decides to go to korea. she wants me to join her. (urgh!)   do i need this? korea? money?   i could settle for a large McDonald's fries. i don't mind earning my meager salary as long as i'm peaceful wherever i am. but korea?   is that in mars?

             Fertility Tree                              The headlight blurred my vision; I raised my right arm against my eyes and watched as the approaching vehicle turned to my left. It was one of those mini-buses’ that roamed the campus. It stopped a few meters from my tree. Stopped and headed off. There was nobody. I am alone again.                             I sat on the grass under the tree. What kind of tree? This one was large, the board with it’s scientific name on it was torn years ago, only a nail that marked it that It was once named, remained, protruding inviting danger. Rusty and inviting .  This rusty nail faced against wind and storm and sun and it grew old with the tree. The tree and the nail, now nameless.                               I sat on the grass under the tree.    What kind of a tree? I do not know. The wind blew and I felt it cold.    School is about to close; the year is about to close. The store across the street is about to close. There were a few students lounging along on the grass, but no, there was no one with me under the tree. Another car is approaching my way; it’s the third in ten minutes.    The campus is about to close.                              On the grass, under my un-known tree, I watched as the sun changed the color of the skies. In a few minutes, it will be dark soon. But look, see, the sky is turning to orange, then red, then blue. Then darkness. The campus is about to close. I watched as those who lounged a few meters from me decided to go anyway.                              The year is about to close. The wind is cold. The field in front is empty.    I sat still, now on a large root under my tree.                                 My phone rang, three times I think, maybe more. I felt it. I reached and didn’t recognize the number. “What time is it?” I asked.    “What? And now you think you’re some place else, maybe the North Pole?”    The voice on the other line retorted, then laughed so hard.    I laughed along. “Damn phone call.” I murmured. The voice said goodbye finally and left me hanging, thinking what was the call for? Damn phone call.                              The wind felt cold and my heart murmured. Damn phone. I shouldn’t have brought it with me. I never wanted to own one anyway.    If they wanted to reach me, they could go ask for my home phone instead and we could all talk sensibly at the comfort and privacy of my room.    They could call me at night, early morning, any time.    There’s always a line for that. But not this phone. I don’t want a call, I don’t need a phone.    But I did buy one.    Damn phone.                             The night is closing in, should I call?

        not telling the truth is the ultimate sin to me. talk or never mention it at all. should you plan to deny anything at all, make sure that i have no hint of knowing nor of doubting. my questions will probe even your darkest secrets. and my questioning will hurt us both that it is too painful to handle.     therefore, hide or stay quiet.
