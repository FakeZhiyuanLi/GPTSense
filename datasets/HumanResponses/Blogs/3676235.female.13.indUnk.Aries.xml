      Today was the 1st day of school! And i simply detested it..our chinese teacher has changed again for the third time...damn...and the third one was worst of all the three...u noe when i said filthy little cockroach i was referring to my new chinese teacher...i hate her i hate her I HATE HER!!!!!!! From my point of view this particularly foul disgusting little blister has somehow made it a definite point to make our lives as miserable as possible to the extent of...i better not say it...its atrocious behavior..not that i have the right to say that of my teacher..but since i have this blog...why not vent some of my frustrations here...?? anyway thats what blogging helps u to do right?? well..i dunno..however..i jus have to conclude that this is a very very very miserable day for me...and i betcha tomorrow will be even more miserable because tomorrow there are two periods of chinese that means 70 minutes that means one hour and 10 minutes...OH!!THE HORROR!!i really cant stand to go to school anymore..i have already detested mandarin to a very dangerous extent now..and this teacher has made it even worse for me so i have delved even deeper in the hatred of chinese...sigh...can life actually get better?? and she gives us all this homework...some useless crap..why cant she mind her crappy own buisness and leave us poor little mortals alone??why does she have to make our lives even more miserable and pathetic??what does she think she is??the queen??the maharaja?? or some stupid strutting peacock.... Hey..but now that i have looked back on all that i have written?? i dont seem to regret it one  bit...but one must always be forgiving and holy and must be fair to oters right?? i dont hold it against her that much now but the hatred is still there...jus like a shield floating between...but i really hope that she will change her ways and try to be a better teacher...for the sake of herself....and mayeb for the sake of the students too..

      Listening to perfect ten right now..and its playing a song by BLUE.. its 8.59pm now..gonna be 9 already..always thought the radio station rox..couldnt live a day without listenin to its music..but recently ive been into chinese music at dong li 88.3fm...therefore started listening to that instead of the english radio station..but i soon grew ired of that and came back to 98.7fm..and found that the songs are nicer..therefore im gonna listen to this radio station for the rest of the year..hehe...LOVE "morning madness"...when my dad is driving my brother and me to school, my bro will always tune the radio into perfect ten...the DJs-->Shaik Haikal and Danial Ong are hilarious!!Sometimes the sound of them laughing makes me wanna laugh too..Hehe..Tomorrow is our school's founders day..and its the most important event of the year in my school..im sure tomorrow's performance is gonna be great!! We have to go to school tomorrow at about 9am..thats pretty late for school days and we dont need to study at all..besides doing the content page for literature and stuff...really love the smallville show..and the books too..they are really enjoyable to watch and read..Im feeling quite tired now..have not taken my afternoon nap in ages..you can call me a pig but i really need to catch up on some sleep...in secondary school..stress soon takes its toll and you'll look like a walking zombie sooner or later..today is a thursday and is the longest and most boring and tiring day of the week..during chinese lesson, our chinese teacher asked us to do some acting..it really freaked me out..my role was a doctor and i kept stuttering my lines..instead of facing the "reporter", i faced the white board..too shy and frightened..i dont think anyone heard me saying my lines though..and even they did my chinese must really suck..after my acting was over i was still shivering in fear and could not stop shaking..quite a terrible experience for me...think i have stage-fright

      Sometimes I have my doubts of words altogether, and I ask myself what is the place of them. They are worse than nothing unless they do something; unless they amount to deeds, as in ultimatums or battle-cries. They must be flat and final like the show-down in poker, from which there is no appeal. My definition of poetry (if I were forced to give one) would be this: words that become deeds.All poetry is a reproduction of the tones of actual speech.There are two types of relists: the one who offers a good deal of dirt with his potato to show that it is a real one, and the one who is satisfied with the potato brushed clean. I'm inclined to be the second kind. To me, the thing that art does for life is to clean it, to strip it to form.A poem begins with a lump in the throat; a home-sickness or a love-sickness. It is a reaching-out toward expression; an effort to find fulfillment. A complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found the words.Education is the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper. :)

                               The Final Analysis  People are often unreasonable, illogiacal and self-centered; Forgive them anyway.  If you are kind, people may accuse you of having selfish, ulterior motives; Be kind anyway.  If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies; Succeed anyway.  If you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; Be honest and frank anyway.  What you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight; Build anyway.  If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous; Be happy anyway.  The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; Do good anyway.  Give the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; Give the world the best you have anyway.  You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God; It was never between you and them anyway.   I think this anyway thingy above is very nice..The VP and Mr Tam told us about it..I like all those anyway parts..LOL..that is so very lame..anyway im gonna post another poem about being a christian or something..even though im not a christian..im a catholic for your information..im jus gonna put it here...its nice..nice things are meant to be shared.                   When I say..."I am a christian"   When I say...."I am a Christian" I'm not shouting "I am saved" I'm whispering "I get lost!" "That is why I choose this way"  When I say.... "I am a Christian" I don't speak of this with pride I'm confessing that I stumble And need someone to be my guide  When I say..."I am a Christian." I'm not trying to be strong I'm professing that I'm weak And pray for strength to carry on.  When I say...."I am a Christian." I'm not bragging of success I'm admitting I have failed And cannot ever pay the debt  When I say...."I am a Christian." I'm not claiming to be perfect My flaws are too visible But God believes I'm worth it.  When I say...."I am a Christian" I still fell the sting of pain I have my share of heartaches Which is why I seek His name  When I say..."I am a Christian" I do not wish to Judge I have no Authority I only know I'm loved  This is by Carol Wimmer..im gonna post another one on forgiveness..hope i dont bore you..:)                            Forgiveness  Forgiveness is not only meant for people we love or care for. Forgiveness is also meant for the people we hate.  Forgiveness is not a word of mouth saying I forgive you. It is an act of choice to embrace the person again. It is to embrace him enough so that he can be transformed by the grace of God.  On top of that, forgiving others now opens the door to forgive yourself for not being able to forgive them earlier.   haha..forgiveness..is a good virtue..work on it... Humpty-Dumpty sat on the stable Humpty-Dumpty touched a live cable He was electricuted And he exploded And the king had him for breakfast at his table.  That poem above is very very lame..well i came across it in one of the blogs..jus wanted to show you haha..hmm..maybe you are asking dont i have better things to do??well..i have tons of better and more boring things to do..however..i prefer to do the lames one...lol..  AN OLD MAN ASLEEP     The two worlds are asleep, are sleeping, now.  A dumb sense possesses them in a kind of solemnity.     The self and the earth—your thoughts, your feelings,  Your beliefs and disbeliefs, your whole peculiar plot;     The redness of your reddish chestnut trees,  The river motion, the drowsy motion of the river R   Hmm..i dont understand it right away,which is good,because there's nothing so tedious as a poem that can be understood straight away..hey..i came across another poem which is similiar to the anyway one above..but this one was kinda attributed to mother theresa of calcutta..shes a good woman..she really is..  Discipleship is an unusual undertaking; The better you become at it, the more difficult and challenging it will be. Be a disciple anyway.  The people you are called to serve may be unlikable, ungrateful and unimpressed by your dedication. Love and serve them anyway.  If you do good, people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good anyway.  The good you do for Christ will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.  Honesty, humility and simplicity make you vulnerable. Be honest, humble and simple anyway.  What you spend yours building may seem insignificant in the eyes of others. Build anyway.  People really need help but may attack you if your help them. Help them anyway.  Give the world the best you have and you may get kicked in the teeth. Give the world your best anyway.    Theres another one below..written by Peter Mcwilliams..its the best i have ever seen in ages..its really extremely nice..dont believe me??well read it!  My life has fallen down around me before ___lots of times, for lots of reasons___ usually other people.  And most of the time I was fortunate enough  to have a large lump of that life hit me on the  head and render me numb to the pain & desolation that followed. And I survived And I live to love again.  But this, this slow erosion from below ___or within___ it's me falling down around my life  because you're still in that life ___but not really. And you're out of that life ___but not quite.  I do all right alone, and better together,  but  I do very poorly when  semi- together.  In solitude  I do much, in love, I do more, but in doubt I only transfer pain to paper in gigantic Passion Plays complete with miracles and martyrs and crucifixions and resurrections.  Come to stay  or stay away.  This series of passion poems is becoming a heavy cross to bare  I must REALLY be boring you to death am i??well..i suppose ill jus stop here..i suppose this entry is dedicated to poems lol..ive noticed those really long blogs are hard to read and kinda boring..once i publish this post i wont read it ever again..since i know the contents and everything and i myself dont like to read long blogs..so i guess this entry will only be read by one every few zillion people who come across this..bye..on wanna spend my time boring you anymore..bye...GOD BLESS YEW!!!!BOO YA!!!!!!!!BYE!!!!!!
