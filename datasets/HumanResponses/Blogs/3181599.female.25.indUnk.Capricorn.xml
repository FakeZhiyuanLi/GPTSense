      if there were laws to follow on how to live life and anyone who dares break it has his dear life to pay for it, all of us would be gone by now. glad that there were no rules to follow, no laws to go by..and all us can live life whether it is with reason or without...   Perfect Reason by aleward  You are the reason For me to write a song And you are the reason For making me smile everyday And I wish you could feel my presence  When you’re alone  You bring light to my way And you are the reason for saving my drowning soul And every place I go I always think of you  If I were an angel I would give up my immortality I’d die with you Coz I’m here for you are …my perfect reason  You’re sitting right beside me And as I look into your eyes There’s something in you More than words can say And as I make my journey It’s so nice to think  That you’re here with me

        parallax error  Try pointing one finger at an object that’s a few meters away from you, say a wall clock. Then cover one eye at a time. Which one focused exactly? There should only be one. If you used your finger on your right hand, the eye that gives the right focus should be the left one (that means, the right eye is shut) and vice versa What explains this? its something called parallax error – an optical illusion of some sort.  My grad school prof who seems to know a little of so many things told us this including the fact that employment at IRRI (dedicated to irrigation research, among other things) pays well (surprising for a government agency).

        TGIF and the cast  Sitting-under-the-sun left after lunch, no clues as to why. she's smiling nowadays..no clues either. The muse is looking not so busy these days --- that’s news, news, news! So is child-meets-piolo, no room for panic right now and she’s happy with her CDs and flosssss! human-breathing-songs is the opposite of the muse, no song heard from her in the last few hours and the guy-in-striped shirt has been waiting for the same number of hours human-breathing-songs has been quiet – spell b-u-s-y. in spite of that, how can this day go wrong when mr. right just gave her a ring? Wink, wink :)   There’s no telling what’s instore for everyone tonite --- Friday. Still TGIF! hapi weekend! ;)

        Griffin and Sabine   Have you come across this book?  If not, do read.  It’s a mysterious love story between two people who have not seen each other but have fallen deeply in love and only through postcards.   Its pricey so I ended up reading it right there at Powerbooks.  Some things you can have for free. hehe

        me, my aging and 1st day of school   These past few days, I’ve been doing a presentation on market trends and interestingly, there is a market waiting to be tapped among those age 50 and above. There is an aging population ready to spend just to look young and feel good.  Yesterday, Wednesday while I rested my fingertips on the keyboard, it dawned on me that the other day, Tuesday was supposedly my 1st day of school. I just missed it.  All these stuff about aging...   so anyway, about me, aging and going to school, i feel that i have to go to school now or I may soon forget and they say that the learning curve becomes less steeper as you get old. now i do not know how to reconcile that with me forgetting so soon when im still not too old.. i would like to believe that, that particular 'forgetting moment' was the exception, just that and not me the person hehe!

       subject: no entry no id 101  heartonsleeve, who accompanied me to enroll in what so happens to be her dear alma mater wasn’t allowed entry becoz she had no id. So she had to wait for me for about an hour and a half in the gate while i desperately had to juggle my way thru the campus, the campus was small but every door and hallway looks the same – a labyrinth!  Heartonsleeve, says she didn’t mind waiting coz the sight was ‘good’:) nevertheless, grazie!!!  You deserve someone more than just a ‘drummer looking for bandmates’! oh,but if he turns out to be somebody, looking for something more, you may want to consider :)

      I couldn’t hold it up any longer, so I gobbled down on it while strolling in the mall (so much for etiquette hehe). Flosssss! its one of breadtalk’s bestsellers. Located in g4 where Pazzo used to be, Breadtalk is the newest talk of the town –(to borrow fortywink’s term) delicioso!

       up on the roof  When this old world starts getting me down And people are just too much for me to face I climb way up to the top of the stairs And all my cares just drift right into space On the roof, it's peaceful as can be And there the world below can't bother me Let me tell you now  When I come home feelin' tired and beat I go up where the air is fresh and sweet  I get away from the hustling crowd And all that rat-race noise down in the street  On the roof, the only place I know Where you just have to wish to make it so Let's go up on the roof   At night the stars put on a show for free And, darling, you can share it all with me  I keep a-tellin' you  Right smack dab in the middle of town I've found a paradise that's trouble proof (up on the roof) And if this world starts getting you down There's room enough for two Up on the roof   d, thanks for bein up on the roof with me, hapi third :)

      before i always see him as a piece of a puzzle that just wont fit in. i didnt know if it was the right piece to begin with or i just got entirely lost in the puzzle. but one day i decided to drop it. we parted ways. we lost contact.  two days ago, we just spoke. it was his mom's bday and for old times' sake, i refused the lure of indifference and sent my greetings thru text. he rang to say hello. his mom says thank you and invited me to come over. asked how he was, he told me that he's leaving for the US for good. i was surprised and he sounded really excited that i couldnt help but be excited for him too. he was doing it finally. he says he will miss home and everything tied to it including me. he's finally chasing his dreams or something close to it. the day would be the 27th of this month. im happy for him. Truly happy :)   and im happy for myself too. finally, im seeing it, i can piece together the puzzle and im seeing that the piece just fits right. thank you po Lord :)

       Patriot.  I never considered myself a patriot. Filipino was the subject that I could fail. Tagalog movies and OPM rarely appealed to my taste. My reading the dailies was not meant to care but was merely a part of that “slightly economist upbringing” I had. And even if it merited the headlines, the country’s political affairs were the least of my concerns.   The last few days, I jolted out of myself. I was eager and defiant about saving the country. I was tearfully frustrated at some people’s loose thinking of choosing their leaders. I was dismayed to mad at how scarred idealism was. On the one hand, I was fighting the urge to give up. I was hopeful and idealistic and brave. For the first time in my life, I felt how it is to stand for something or someone you believe in. Even if the bandwagon believes otherwise, I didn’t shrink, I stayed afloat.      Yesterday, reality was starting to sink in --- uggh! Very cruel --- how easily reality can just throw away everything. I’m yielding to reality but my belief.   For now, I’m just glad that even for just a few days, I became a patriot somehow. Until then.

       BIG FISH.  edward bloom meets sandra templeton. “They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops and its true” - edward bloom  son begins to learn that extraordinary things can in fact happen, that fairy tales can exist...that there are things in life that we'll always find hard to believe.. even when its being told by someone who cannot betray us with the truth..  could it be that life is sometimes too good to be true or have we become too cynic to believe that too-good things can still come true? glad that i am only halfway-cynic and that i still would like to believe in that time-stopping moment that edward bloom claims to be true..

       missing someone.   you dont wanna argue with yourself when you're missing someone. you lose the argument anyhow  you scour for logic as to how's and why's but where is logic to begin with, when you're missing someone..  i am missing him but i will attempt  not to lose the argument. maybe if i win i will know  that i didn't miss him after all. maybe..

      They say when you know exactly what’s going to happen, you rarely look forward to it. That’s why we show up late for meetings or appointments, we dread routines, and there’s hardly any anticipation for school or work. The element of certainty makes anything mundane.  I guess what “joey” said about uncertainty being the thrill of any experience is true.   Schooled and trained in the area of finance, I never thought I was going to get into a different industry.  Research and product development. What was I to know? First, I had nothing to show for it. Clueless.   Nike’s swoosh says “just do it” So I did. Never mind how uncertain the days to follow are. Found solace in the thrill. But to begin with, wasn’t exactly that, that got me here?   The thrill of uncertainty. But for how long? Maybe not long enough.   Until then, I’ll just have to cross my fingers, maybe then, uncertainty will find me again.

       no plans  I can’t recall an instance where I actually planned and saw that plan gradually come to life. Except for short weekend trips and craved-for shoes or tops, planning to me is alien.   What has been in my life and what is, were all part of what I considered impulse decisions. They did not form part of an exquisite road map that consists of clear-cut directions or signs. They were merely the most convenient and logical decisions to make at the time. Sort of a to-do list, have you done yours today?

      My photoframed image of Van Gogh’s painting given by a dear friend was sitting on the floor for two days, thinking it was just one of the rental bills.  The green mango I so eagerly demanded and happened to be left-over from an out-of-town trip turned a bit yellowish to rotten after being untouched for a week.  I crave for a thing and when I finally get it, ends up unnoticed. Then I crave for another one and who knows if the same thing happens. The reverse cycle of irony is that, something or someone seems so dear but as soon as its gone, that’s when the real price surfaces.  True for me too.

       Sleepy Thursday and Rainy Friday     On a rainy Friday morning:   In-a-rush-me:  MRT lang po manong. I was ready to hand over my P50 bill when the figure on the taxi meter surprised me: 31.00.  Only.   Enthralled me:  (Manong pulling out a P20 bill as change) keep the change manong.   (sigh) I hope manong realizes soon that his taxi meter is costing him more.    On a sleepy Thursday:  So I almost got off the wrong station if not for one girl, who walked towards me, tapped me lightly on the shoulder and woke me up.  Then I almost lost my all-time favorite black shoes if not for the train’s janitor who handed it over to me.   Thanks God for random acts of kindness :)

       Our constant bedfellows  Don’t you just love books and French films and friends who will lend you company to see films like these..     I still can’t get the image out of my head ---  Luo seeing the ‘little seamstress’ walk away to explore the city. It’s a scene from the movie “Balzac.” Balzac is a French writer and journalist who through one of his masterpieces “Ursule Mirouet” will, in the movie change the little seamstress’ life forever.    Spanning during the Cultural Revolution where intellectual youngsters were sent to the countryside to be “re-educated”, the story revolves around Luo and Ma, two intellectual youngsters sent to one of the poorest provinces in China. Toiling very hard and adjusting to the folks’ primitive way of life, life for Luo and Ma was hard. But was made colorful when they meet “the little seamstress”,  a girl from the countryside whom both Luo and Ma falls in love with. It was Luo, though who pursued the girl. Ma never told the girl that he loved her too, out of his respect for Luo but he loved her in his own simple ways with the pair of sneakers he gave her, his readings on Luo’s absence etc  As the little seamstress walks away to try her luck in the city, Luo asks what changed her and she answers him, “Balzac.” None of them knew that that was to be their last encounter. Many years after, Luo and Ma reunites, now both successful in their chosen careers and they reminisce life in the countryside including the little seamstress and Balzac..    How a book can change one’s life forever...  Oh yes, books – our constant bedfellows, patient, unyielding, powerful...   Postscript: child-meets-piolo and be-my-lady till our next popcorn date!

       The west lake dilemmas   When you are too hungry and the food you just ordered takes so long to be served, you can’t yell at the waiter and demand for your food or you’ll face the risk of it being subject to who-knows-what.    You cannot cancel it either and transfer to another place coz you’re too hungry to wait for another round of waiting.  When the food ends up not up to your expectations, you cannot demand for a change of order or the hunger might just gorge you up for waiting another round.   And when the food finally gets served and realize you’ve been waiting for more than you can afford, you can’t complain anyhow, coz the drink that might be served soon after may again be subject to who-knows-what.  When the bill arrives and the price just don’t seem worth it, you cannot complain coz you can’t give back what you’ve eaten.    While giving a tip is almost always de riguer, you just don’t give it, because of all the waiting and everything, how can it just be worth it?   Ahh dilemmas!

       A love letter to my feet  June 20, Sunday 330p   To my dearest feet,  Even after walking you, running you especially when I’m in a rush and tripping you over at times, I have not heard you complain.  Just how do you manage that? Ahh, i just cannot imagine how I would get by without you.   So today, I will pamper you. I’ll soak you in lukewarm water, let you experience that foot massage thing they show on tv. I will scrub you till all your calluses and dead skin cells go away. I will soothe you, and rub you with that flowery mint perfume they call foot scrub. I will massage you and take all those stress away. And if it tickles, that means my goal to pamper you is working..   This is your day off.  For simply making life easier for me. And in case you don’t know just yet, you mean the whole world to me, grazieee!!  Lovingly,  Your whole-body-up-there :)

       Beware of the runny nose  Meet runny nose. He can run after you Wherever you run and go He hardly runs away Once he runs into you. You will run out of breathe You will run out of tissue You will run out of patience rubbing the nose with the tissue You will run out of money buying tissue to rub the nose with  You can run a fever  It won’t run off easily  You can hardly run And you can hardly run for work So run for dear life before it spreads around in town Beware of the runny nose Or it can catch and bring you down.

      to the cynics of these days:  "Eyes that hadn’t opened for days did, and they weren’t chalky or vague. They were clear and blue and full of love. If a death can be lovely, his was."   -patti davis on Reagan's last moments

      I was making my first official stage appearance as a grad stude --- like every amateur, I was nervous. The eyes were like bows ready to let loose from the arrows but thanks to the element called time, the curtain was closed and I was off the stage. Quite down at the below-average performance but nonetheless glad that it’s over. second chances --- that’s what its made for!

       poetry reading  The cast and the curious on poetry reading: they :  First time mo ba?   The cast and the curious:  Di ah!    That in an attempt to be cultured, well-read and among the literati :)  Have you been to a poetry reading? Well, truth is, the cast and the curious haven't been to one.. until yesterday night :) the moment you step into ‘Conspiracy’ on a Tuesday night, you will find yourself surrounded with at least one national artist, a horde of UP professors, students, artists, young and old, all sharing the same passion: poetry.   You can sing the poems out, simply read it, act it out etc. etc. Choose your style. To each his own..     after all its poetry.

       to the boss ...whose middle name is ‘passion’, I agree with you that there’s a time for everything and for now you just have to go. The sad part about leaving is that everyone is simply sad and you’re the only one who can make sense out of your leaving, but isn’t that a wonderful kind of sadness? cheeerSSSS!!! :)

        the play called 'sanctum'   Friday night was 43’s despedida – the last to go among the little women. The rest of the little women 47, 40, and 164, in that exact order left the play called ‘sanctum’ one by one beginning June of last year.  Three years back, the little women auditioned for this play and passed for what they thought was just a simple manuscript to follow. It was the best ever written and the play’s director had the genius to craft the finest in friendships.    47 didn’t make it that night. Neither did 71, who accidentally joined the league for obvious reasons --- she was charming and funny and food-loving (the single most important factor to pass)  55, and the other ex’s who came before the little women, were also there. Well, 55 was not exactly one of the little women (wink wink) but she had the heart and mind that made her no different from them, yin and yang – that’s how 153 tagged her that night. And they endlessly tossed each other with ‘saw-you-with’ anecdotes  (sino na nga ba talaga?hehe)  Besides foods and drinks, the one other overwhelming company was stories, stories, stories. The promise ring between 39 and 46 was finally sealed with a marriage ring. The come-backing 45 will seal his own too very soon. And so are two other ex’s of sanctum. aww love is in the air :) Wonder when dippin dots and da man will?:)   Everyone was ribbing at 36 (43’s bf) on how he must keep his seal of loyalty while 43’s away coz the ‘double 007s’ are all over and the only safe hideaway for him is the ‘citi’. More ribbing ensued while 36 endlessly begged 43 to rub his back as they conjure up their ‘spa’ plans for the weekend.   The night was a rendezvous of memories. There’s 40 who had her share of the teasing -- she and her short-lived stint with 41, which never went beyond the trading floor (let him go, 40 hehe). there's 153 who's just happy come rain or shine. and why the ones that are never there always gets the biggest pie in the conversation? there's ex-44 and ex-71 and 59 and ex-47, etc etc    And who can stop 45  from baring his lists? The long list of codenames and blind items (stretch your imagination, pleaasssse)   By the time most of the guests have left, 36 was still begging and so 43 eventually gave in, she rubbed his back (what da love and da man combined can do, lucky da man hehe).   173 (?) has his own stories to tell too, on one evening with his other half, a bright idea lit the whole town (ting!) ----  it was possible for one to talk inwards and cough inwards  ----- it may have been unnoticed, but a laughing gas probably found its way out coz everyone couldn’t stop laughing to the point of breathlessness. what will eventually be tagged as “the discovery of the century” culminated the night of stories and white wine and tequila and samba chocolates and homemade longganisa, 3 in the morning, dizzy from laughing, half-dreamy, homesick all of a sudden.     The little women’s part in the play called ‘sanctum’ was over and it did so with 43’s grand exit ----now off to find her own place under the sun.   To 43 a.k.a.  dippin dots , i believe you can play the part and you can play it well.. whatever role, wherever (notre dame or cornell),  the days with the little women will remain  sweet and creamy  and it will get even sweeter and creamier the second time around --- looking forward to our next reunion :)

        Ok so I will miss  the sub-urban setting  the bumpy ride to the green fields  green building and green rooftops    the opm songs  that gets bearable by the day  the mushy songs  that melts the heart anyway    the pocket-friendly meals  that tastes just right  if you only half-expected them to  walking strictly on pedestrian lanes  eating only at the pantry  on pantry times  when there’s pantry food around    finally the cast  who’s a bunch of colorful personas  makukulit  and smart  makukulit  and mahilig sa music  makukulit  and fun-loving  and makukulit pa rin.    at least for 8 months, ako’y naging isang..      “bagong Pilipino – maka- Pilipino” &nbsp; &nbsp;   paalam, sa ating muling pagkikita   :)

         old wardrobe     To a dear dear friend,      &nbsp;     I think you’ve been wearing your weird pants lately. You seem to have wandered off into another planet where it’s just you and your so-called ‘the one’. I hope your old wardrobe is still there. I miss the old-fashioned suit and the pair of happy feet too -- they look&nbsp;good in you.&nbsp;     &nbsp;     Your old-fashioned friend

       winespirits  You seem to know the right choices, the right timing and the right places – all the time. So fasten your seatbelt, drive down the road and head to where you must be, just don’t forget to hit the brakes, when you see humps in the way.   belated happy birthday! :)

      I found the most inexpensive, useful therapy right inside my house, doing the laundry. The only activity at home, that I spend the longest time doing next to sleeping  --- it takes my mind off from the stress of the day and brings out the domesticated self in me :)

      On my first day at work, may nag-erupt na pimple right on my nose. Then coming to school the next day, a classmate of mine remarked (without necessarily referring to the pimple)  blooming daw ako. Baka na-love at first sight ako sa work. Good sign, is it?
