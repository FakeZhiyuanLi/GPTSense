      The five things I missed most about home:   Good toilet paper. You may laugh, but good toilet paper can be the difference between me in a good mood, and me in a bad mood in the morning.  My dog. I was able to keep in touch with the rest of my family relatively easily via MSN, email, and the phone, but there was no way I could give my dog a virtual pat on the tummy over the internet. I did talk to her on the phone, though, and her tail began to wag when she heard my voice, apparently. Also, it's really nice to wake up and have her sleeping at my feet.  Sleeping till whenever I want. It's about 12:15 PM right now, and I just woke up. Damn it feels good to get a good night's rest. Speaking of that...  My bed. Unlike the mattresses at Carleton, it's  more  than three inches thick.  Q-Tips. I forgot them at home and never thought to buy them at Carleton. Boy, was I glad to have those little SOBs back.   The five things I miss most about Shad Carleton:   Obviously the people. I wasn't even gonna' mention this, figuring that it was a given, but here we are. I'm just that sentimental a geek. I'm just a big social animal, so I really miss the all-people, all-the-time feeling you get at Shad.  The wide selection at meal-times. Here I'm limited to what I feel like cooking/what's in the fridge.  The schedule. There my being actually had something of a purpose; here, I'm free to fuck away the days as I please. Yes, the lectures may have been boring as Hell sometimes, but at least we were all bored together and for a  reason .  The creative fashion choices I would make so that I wouldn't have to do laundry. Here it's back to normal scrubbiness, wearing pyjamas 24/7.  And of course, once again, the people. It's worth saying twice how awesome you guys are.   If anyone's feeling extra sad (as I am), download the following songs: "Pizza Day" by the Aquabats, "Drunk Again" by Reel Big Fish, and "San Francisco Payphone" by Catch-22. They're all ska bands and personal favourites of mine. "Drunk Again" might make you even more sad, but it's such a good song that it just begs mentioning.

      And I'm home now. I want to thank everyone who made it possible, and everyone who made it special. You all know who you are and what you've done.  To everyone from Shad: you had all better keep in contact! If we didn't talk all that much at Shad that's all the more reason for talking to me now! That goes double for the PAs and staff.  I'm too tired to write anything more than that right now, and I'm still too sad to write anything good.  Rock on, mofos.  Cheers from my basement - Donut

      So don't go freaking out since I haven't updated the Blog in awhile. We've moved into crunch time for DE and for the committees, so I'm very, very, very, very busy right now. I probably won't be calling home as I have very little free time; hell, I probably don't even have time to write this. If there's something of dire importance email me: I'm usually on MSN so I can communicate with my other house members and check my mail everytime I log on.    I miss everybody back home lots. Friday seems so far away and so close all at once.    Cheers from si'ty fi'ty fi',  - Cary

      Well do ya', punk? You know what, you can't  handle  the stress!   That's the way most of us are feeling. It's pretty intense right now.   Let me paint a picture for you.   You and 12 teammates have to come up with: an original, unique device based on a theme; a working prototype, and a model of the final device if at all possible; a corporate website to go along with this device; a complete business plan approximately 20-30 pages in length; and a full marketing plan and strategy. Oh, I should mention something: you have a little over a week to do this, working on it only 1 or 2 hours a day.   That is the very essence of the DE Project. What does DE stand for? No one knows. Some speculate "Disaster and Emergency," as per this year's theme of Diaster and Emergency Preparedness. Others believe it stands for "Design and Engineering." Personally, I think it's an acronym for "Die, Everybody!" That's the way it  feels , anyhow.   I suppose the purpose is to emulate the business world, where timelines mean money and deadlines mean jobs. There the stress is real. Here's it's all a fantasy - an elaborate and highly complex fantasy - but a fantasy nonetheless. Still, the stress here is real in its own way: we know that the end results won't  really  matter, but our desire to please and our drive to succeed supercede reality. I've taken the advice my Uncle Ray gave me before I came here to heart: like to win, win, and win early. &nbsp; I'm tired. Anyhow, off to bed now. &nbsp; Tata from Carleton, - Cary

      Last update I promised that I'd tell you about my house, Green House. I will, don't worry: you'll still get to meet the fantastic people that make up Green Visions eventually; however, not in this update. Yesterday was Ottawa Day (July 15th, this update was written over the course of several days), and I feel that that supercedes Green Visions.   Ottawa Day. Our one day alone with the city. No direction, no strictly regulated time. Well, our time  was  regulated. It came in two blocks of two hours: one from 11am-1pm, and one from 4:30pm-7pm. But still... free time! It's something to be cherished here at Shad Valley, akin to the way a mother robin sits on her eggs. I'll start at the beginning of the day, though. No use in  beginning a story in the middle.   We woke up earlier than usual yesterday (well, I did anyhow). Breakfast ran from 7:30-8:00, with us leaving for downtown Ottawa at 8:00, in the hopes that we'd be there and organzied for 8:30. That went well enough. The bus ride was fun and full of energy, as bus rides usually are. I had my ska music (RBF!), so I was content. It was a little bit rainy, a little bit wet, but that&nbsp; didn't dampen our spirits. I tried to look appropriately touristy when we reached Parliament Hill. Some of the Shads had never seen the Parliament buildings before, so there was lots of picture taking and Oooing and Aaahing. As much as I mock here, they  are  impressive buildings, and always instill me with a very fierce patriotism everytime I see them.   We took the standard tour of the buildings. Red and Blue house split off to go with one tour guide, Green and Orange the other. Lisette, Luna and Melissa are all in Orange house, so I spent most of the tour with them. The most exciting part of the tour (I've done it 2 or 3 times before, and it was boring the first time) was at the beginning. Luna was joking about how they'd stop her and take her aside because she's a "terrorist" (her parents are both Indian). She went through security, then I did. As we were collecting our things on the other side I said, "oh, the terrorist detector didn't accidentally go off?" She laughed and said, "no." It was at this time that one of the scarier-looking security personel turned to us and said, "no jokes like that inside,&nbsp; please" in a very stern voice. Scared sheet-white, I nodded and managed to get out an "I'm sorry." One of the security personnel turned to me, smiled, and said (in a very warm voice), "don't worry, just don't do it again in there." Thank God for Canada. If I had been in the 'States,  I'm fairly certain I would have been nailed to a cross and placed out on the front lawn for vultures to pick at.   The rest of the tour was rather boring, as the Library is closed until next September for&nbsp; renovations/restorations. That's the only part of the building I really like; the smell of so many old books together is something magical. That, and the architecture of the building itself is something to behold: it's quite amazing, and I'm always slack-jawed everytime I see it.   After the tour of Parliament we had several hours of free time to ourselves. Since I've been to Ottawa several times before and have a pretty good sense of the downtown, I offered to take a group around wherever they wanted to go. We headed down to the March√© in the Rideau Centre. Crepes for breakfast/lunch are always a good choice, and I chose strawberry and apple with chocolate sauce on top. A good way to start the day.     Next we headed off to HMV. Not very exciting to some of the more suburban among the group, it was an absolute spiritual  experience  for the people from more rural areas. I think we spent about 45 minutes in there. I bought 4 CDs: the Billy Talent CD, Modest Mouse's  The Lonesome Crowded West , whatever The Mars Volta's CD is (De-loused in the Comatorium, I think), and the only CD they had in stock by The Soundtrack of Our Lives. All four CDs are most excellent, with TSoOL's being the best. I do like the Modest Mouse quite a bit, especially since I've been searching for that CD forever and was on the verge of ordering it from the Internet.   After that it was time to head over to the National Gallery. It was raining out, so we all arrived sopping wet. This was my... third time being to the National Gallery, I think. It's an amazing place to just sit. So very relaxing. Peaceful, if you will. However, peace and tranquility aren't part of the Shad work ethic, so we were off on a guided tour of the Gallery (not all of it though, and certainly none of the more interesting parts), and then we were receiving a landscape-drawing lesson.  The tour was pretty good. Our guide was rather knowledgeable, but it wasn't anything I hadn't heard before. I asked more questions in that 30 minute tour than I have in all the lectures and activities combined. Art's just my thing I guess, not business and science. I'll leave those things to the people who don't need beauty in their lives (hah).   The landscape-drawing lesson was also nothing I hadn't already learned/retained (which speaks well of Mr. Hanna's teaching abilities), so I pretty much just sat around listening to one of my four new CDs and trying to pretend that I was interested in what I was supposed to be doing. In the end the instructor told me I needed to use less gray. I suggested that I probably should have used white paper rather than... you guessed it, gray.   After that we were off on our own, and it was time for me to play tour-guide again. Since I felt like going to the By-Ward Market and that general area of town, I found a group that was headed in the same direction but had absolutely no idea of how to get there. The Market was fun enough. It's more of a place for girls, what with all the jewellry and clothes and fruit and such, but it's still an interesting place to be.   Angus and Rosie and everyone bought ice cream, but I wasn't really in the mood for that, so I headed over to the Beaver Tails stand. No trip to Ottawa is complete without a Beaver Tail, afterall. I bought a chocolate hazelnut 'Tail as a sort of... appetizer. This is where the party splits. Some people wanted to go explore the Market and Ottawa in general, whilst others wanted to get some food into them and have dinner. I was in the latter group. John, Steve V, Katharine and I all headed off in search food.   We were going to more in the restaurant/pubby part of town, when we saw a group of our friends (mainly from Orange house, those loonies) sitting down at the Hard Rock Cafe. Our taste in company overpowered our taste in food, and we decided to go sit down with them to a dinner at the HRC. Ottawa has several excellent restaurants; I know, I've dined at some of them. The Hard Rock Cafe is not one of them, not even by a long stretch. It's mediocre and over-priced at best, simply  bad  at worst. Still, we were with friends, so it was all good.   We payed our bills, took some pictures, and then decided to wander around the Market for awhile. First stop: Beaver Tails, for those who hadn't already had one. Many in the group were confused: actual beavers' tails? No, no. Just deep-fried batter with stuff on top. Oh, okay... Well that's fine. I'll take two.   There are almost always lots of buskers in the Market, and tonight was no exception. Particularly cool were two mimes pretending to be robots. All you had to do was put some money in their basket to activate them. We scrounged together about 5$ or 6$ and then watched them dance. They were quite good, absolutely incredible physical control and  concentration.   I then directed everyone to Sugar Mountain, the best candy store in town. Lisette was in search of gelato, since, being from Cape Breton, she doesn't have those fancy kinds of things. The gelato at Sugar Mountain is far from the best in town, but if you've never driven a car before then a Civic will suffice, so she was happy. Myself, I bought some Chupa Chups and some gigantic suckers (I think I was the gigantic sucker there though: they cost 3$ apiece!).   At that point it was time to head back to the Rideau Centre to meet up with the group. Seven o'clock rolled around, we loaded onto the bus and then headed to the Museum of Science and Technology. Having been there before, I prepared myself for a long sleep. The presentations there were long and boring. &nbsp; After that we headed back to the bus, took and short ride home, and then promptly crashed. &nbsp; I think my laundry's almost done drying, so I best be off now. &nbsp; Tata from Green House Computer #2, Cary

      Shad is fun. Let me get that out right away. Despite all the hard work, the long days, and the excessive time management, Shad is fun. Despite the fact that you're always keeping track of a zillion different things, trying to make sure that nothing is forgotten: no speaker left unthanked, no Late Night left unplanned, no committee meeting skipped. Shad is fun. Plain and simple. Sure, it's not fun in the same way that going out to a party with a group of friends is. It's not fun in the same way that Christmas morning is. But it  is  fun. Make no mistake about that.  I think it's because of the people. You spend everyday with the same group of people. Every minute from when announcements start at 8:30 till Late Night finishes at 10:50 is spent with the same group of people. Naturally, you get to be pretty close pretty quick. I have my own little clique of friends that I hang out with, but I like to think that I can talk/chill/hang with anyone here. I'm just that charming, you see.  I think now would be a good time to tell you about my "clique" (although Shad emphasizes interacting with EVERYONE, we all know that that just isn't feasible and that it's better to make strong ties with a small group of friends than superficial ties with a larger one). Quite simply put, we're the "cool group." That's at least the way it seems here. I think that in a more normal setting, we'd just be the kids with the best social skills. But here... well, you know what they say about the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.  We're normal kids. We enjoy partying, having a good time with our friends, and just generally being teenagers. We're the ones who think that the penis game is funny. We think that various euphemisms for "penis" are funny. We build giant cocks in the sand. We're kids. There's Rosie, Angus, Rory, Stephanie, Ashok, Dan, John, Lisette, Luna, Melissa, and Sheila.  Rosie's from H-town (Hamilton, for those of you not in the know), and she's pretty cool. Good taste in music. Angus is from some rural place in Cape Breton, and has the craziest accent you could ever imagine. He's a DJ, and pretty funny. Rory is the guy that I have the most inside jokes with. He does a lot of acting (well, auditions), and hails from rural New Brunswick (somewhere near Moncton). Stephanie is from Charlottetown. Rory and I have a lot of potato jokes about her (put the potato in the oven and what comes out nine months later? Tater tots! Skin the potato... with your TEETH!). Ashok is a pretty cool dude from Long Island, NY. He originally lived in Mississauga, so he understands my O-town blues. Dan's from Hamilton too. Heavy on the football. Good guy. John's a pretty funny dude from the T-dot. Plays a pretty mean set of bagpipes too. Lisette is awesome. She's a blonde bombshell from Cape Breton. Those Nova Scotians have the damn hottest accents ever. Luna's from New Market. Craziest girl I know. Melissa's a very sweet girl from Calgary. Sometimes kinda blonde, but a definite sweetheart. Sheila's pretty awesome too. She's from Dryden, a small town in Northern Ontario. She's diabetic, but has a really positive outlook on life. I love her to bits. Ah, who am I kidding... I love 'em all to bits.  There are other people I'm friends with too, but those are the ones that I spend most of my free time with.  I'll tell you all about Green House... but not till tomorrow. I've got a super-important meeting to get to now.  Lotsa love to the O-tizzle from the O-dot, - Cary

      It's already been nine days. I'm amazed. It doesn't really feel like nine days at  all  - what it  really  feels like is nine days or nine seconds, all at the same time. My mind's been awhirl all that time, always rushing from one activity to the next. Our time is highly regulated; we'll have anywhere from 4-6 hours a day of lectures, and an equal amount of time spent in activities. We're on from 8:30 in the morning till 11 at night, no exceptions. Shad Valley is all about excellence, afterall. Some of the lectures are incredibly boring and excellent at inducing heavy amounts of sleep. I'll tell you guys all about it later, but right now I have to go to a Diaster Fair. What's a Diaster Fair, you ask? I have no idea. Check in later.  Cheers from Carleton, - Cary   Back Again   I suppose I should talk a little bit about what we actually do here at Shad Valley. Of course I mention the lectures and the activities, but I don't mention what those actually  are , what their point is. All these activities and workshops and lectures are supposed to be helping us with one of two things: our teambuilding skills, or the DE Project. Since most of you know what teambuilding skills are, I'll go into what the DE Project is.  Every year Shad Valley participants are assigned a theme. It's common to all campuses aross Canada; we all have the same amount of time to work on it, same amount of resources, etc. We have to design a device that deals with this theme. Not only do we have to design the device, but also a working prototype, a business plan, a corporate website, a marketing package, and a promotional package. It's a fair bit of work for three weeks. No one really knows what the "DE" in "the DE Project" stands for. Some speculate that it stands for "disaster and emergency," this year's theme. Others believe that it stands for "design and engineering." But no one knows for sure.   We only get about 2 hours of DE Project time a day. Considering the amount of work we have to do, that's not a lot of time. Not a lot at all. So we must be fairly efficient. That's where the teambuilding skills come into play. If you can't work together as a team you're going to fail. Plain and simple. Luckily, my house work together incredibly well. We may not have the coolest people, or the most technically knowledgeable, or the most physically skilled; but, we do have the house that works best together.  The most important part of our team dynamic is how we listen. Every meeting the house has, whether it be regarding the DE Project or not, we assign a different chairperson to chair the meeting. The chair's responsibilities are to basically let only one person talk at a time and keep the others quiet. This gives everyone in the group a leadership role at one time or another, and gives those who would not otherwise make themselves heard a voice.  It didn't used to be this way, however.  Prior to the rotating chair system, we relied on two leaders: myself, and my friend from Nanaimo, Stephen. Being a leader among leaders is quite the feeling, let me tell you. The system worked well enough: there was order and control, and everyone was heard. However, it didn't really reflect the values of Shad, and that wasn't a good thing.  Anyhow, it's about 8:21, and I have to get to a lecture for 8:30. More to come later.  Cheers from Stormont, - Cary

      But first, what ROAR means. ROAR stands for "Rosie's On A Rampage." It's the name of the song that Jeff, Ben and I wrote at our last band rehearsal. Well, the music anyhow. I'm going to write the actual lyrics. JBP didn't show up to rehearsal, and Jeff said, "dudes, I have this drum beat and I want it to be in a song." So he started playing it, and when Ben didn't have any ideas, I ran with it. It's pretty bitchin' song. I think we're going to use it to close on the 19th.  I wanted to write a song and call it ROAR right after Rosie attacked Coutts in that fateful game of football (which Rosie, Steph, Emily and I CONQUERED. That's right Teoh, we ruined you biatches!). It was supposed to be a nice, friendly game of touch football. Two-hand touch. I guess Rosie interpreted this as "two-hand shove Coutts onto the pavement as soon as he has the ball." She made him bleed. In two spots! You'd think Steph or myself would have been the one to hurt someone, seeing as we're used to rugby and all. But no, it was Rosie. She's a beast, that Rosie.  Gotta like that hustle though.  Anyhow it was right after that that I knew I had to write a song entitled ROAR. I predicted after that unprecedented attack that more would follow in a similar fashion; however, I was sadly mistaken. It seemed to be an isolated incident. Still, the idea intrigued me, and here we are. Hard rockin' as we are.  But, I digress. There are weightier matters to attend to today.  It's something I've mulled over quite a bit lately, and I found a good outlet for it this afternoon. First though, there's the matter of the Importance of Failure. We're all aware of it: our need to fail - while not as motivating in the later years as our need to succeed - is real. Sure we can learn without failing, but do we always truly comprehend? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, Shad taught me a very important dynamic of group work: that sometimes the failures can be more valuable than the successes. That's not to say that this was the  only  thing I learned from Shad - far from it - but in terms of how I live and work with others for the rest of my life, I think this is what will stick with me the longest.  I guess this really all comes down to the way that Green House developed as a team and formed into a cohesive unit. Storytime, here we come.  The first week of Shad. We'd had a few minor successes as a group, the Mini-Project being the most obvious. We were beginning to gel as a group. When asked to describe how we worked together, the words "group dynamic" and "great" or "awesome" often came up in the same sentence. We thought we were pretty good, and coming together nicely. Besides, we hadn't made  any one from our House cry, and that was better than some of the other Houses could say.  Then came the camping trip.  Incorporated into the camping trip was a 2-day course run by Jim Ongena of  urlLink Corporate Heights . Part of that 2-day course was a series of 4 tasks that each House had to complete. You had a certain amount of time to complete each task. After that time had expired, the group would sit down and discuss its performance with whoever was running the task (some Shad staffer). Green House managed to complete 0/4 tasks. It was quite the eye-opening experience.   I think I learned more about myself and Green House in those 2 days than I did in the entire rest of the month. Hell, make that the past 3 years.  More later. Maybe.  Toodle-loo from the basement, - Cary (Donut O)

      A week. It's been a week now since I left Shad. Just a week! Feels more like a year. I can't even remember what I've done... not that there's anything of note. There was the obligatory "Hey, you're home, let's party!" partying, and some rockin' with Beermouse (we've got our first show coming up on the 19th - Masonic Temple in Oakville - be there). I saw the friends who needed seeing the most and tried to keep my Shadditudeous spirit alive. To that end I have done something, I guess. I've written down my goals for the next 6 months, next 6 weeks, and the next month. They're all pretty much the same, but different stages in the development of each goal.  I've begun talks with a friend on starting up a design firm: he has an incredible eye for design, but no business skills whatsoever. I guess I don't either, really, but Shad's taught me enough, so with that and my parents' extensive library of business literature I should be fine.  My band's starting to grow. As I said, we're playing our first show on the 19th. I plan on bringing a lot of the planning and management skills I learned at Carleton back into the band. Not the band as a creative entity, rather the band as a business. My goal for the next six months: Grow Beermouse (that's the band, folks - pure rock'n'roll) to the point where it will be a viable goal to be mothafuckin' RAWK stars by the end of high school (or, for some of the other members, the end of Grade 12 or the end of Grade 10).  As you may have noticed by either the frequency or length of the posts I'm writing, I've also resolved to write everyday. I think I posted that last time, but it's worth saying again, if only to reinforce the discipline into  my  mind. I'll have to write everyday for the Writer's Craft course I'm taking first semester, so I figure I might as well start now. Practise up  before  it counts for marks.  I've begun to run again. My time for 3.5 km: 18 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. That was the very first time, after having not done any training since early June. My time for 3.5 km at the end of last summer, after having trained since May: 17.5 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. Truly a testament to mind over matter, really (or, more proof that the universe is all within my head and I truly am master of all that I survey). This is to help towards my goal of exercising everyday in order to improve my overall physical fitness. I don't really care about how I look; if I  feel  good, then the looks will follow. Form follows functionality, afterall.  There are other goals, but they are (for the most part) boring to others and interesting only to me. Well, that's how I'm rationalizing it. They're upstairs on my desk and I don't feel like going to get them right now. Maybe I'll post them here on the next update.  Speaking of the next update, here's a sneak-peak:     What Shad Taught Me: The Importance of Failure   Ooo, looks cool, doesn't it? Knew you'd be enticed. Next time, on The Cary Show: That thing above, and I explain today's crazy title!  Buh-bye from the basement, - Cary (aka Donut O)

      Ah, back to the depression that I find inherent in the summer. You gotta' love the timeless void of summer; that vacuum of creativity that is too much sleep, too little work and too much food. My friends are mostly gone or leaving (or, for my Shadlings, scattered across the country) and I'm left to my own devices.  It's hard to go from being constantly surrounded by people 24/7 with no true privacy to pretty much left on your own all day. To go from a rigorously scheduled... schedule, to free to amuse yourself. It's a major shift.  I have a lot to do this month. Memorizing lines for  The Importance of Being Ernest  (I'm Jack, the male lead), starting a web design firm with one of my best friends, finally getting my G1, building my band (both our repetoire and our reputation), and earning some money being just a few things. But the one thing I've resolved to do everyday - and that means every single day - is write. It's something that I've always been moderately good at, but I've never dedicated myself to my writing the same way I have to my, say, guitar playing. So I've begun to write everyday. Not necessarily on the blog, but in some way, shape or form. Maybe I scribble something on the wall of my room; maybe I pen a song; maybe it's a long email to a friend, but whatever it is, I'm writing.  So now I'm going to write to you about a group I feel that I've neglected to far too great a degree: my home-dawgs, the buds back home. Sure, I wrote home to them about the Shads, but now I'm writing from home to the Shads about them. But there are so many. Where to begin?  Well, let's start with  the  home-dawgs: Brian, Nate and Kyle. They're more than hme-dawgs, they're my brothers. And I mean that the way black people mean it, cause I think it's closer that way.* We've known each other since elementary school. We didn't really come together as a group until middle school, but we've known/been aware of each other since grade 2 or 3. Funny story about how I met Brian.  It was Grade 3 and we were in the same class. Bri's quite athletic; he is now and he has always been. I was a pretty fat little kid. It was like the classic high school formula: jock picks on the nerdy fat kid. Everyday. Every single day he would harass me, punch me, tease me. Everyday! Trips to the principal's office wouldn't work, no punishment could deter him. Finally - in what kicked off my long path into the world of psychology - I decided to try and understand my enemy. I invited him over to my house one day. Well, my mom called his mom, explained the situation, and then he came over one day. Same thing, really. I forget what happened after that, but we became instand friends (it might have been my mother's homebaked cookies... the'y mmm mmm good).  I don't remember exactly how I met Nathan and Kyle; we were always in the same group of friends, I guess, and somehow we all just came together. Kyle and I go to the same school, WOSS, and Nate and Brian go to the same school, IRHS.  I'm the rock-n-roller-, Bri's the jock, Kyle's the pretty one, and Nate's the kid with tonnes of artistic talent who just wastes it all away dickin' around.  Anyhow, those are the home-dawgs. We've been through the best and the worst together. Damn close. They're welcome at my house anytime, even if we're not home. They don't need to knock; they call my mom, "Mom"; and they treat my little brother like their own. Truly my "bros."  Then there's Kate. Oh, where do I begin with Kate? Our history is long and convoluted; so long in fact, that I think it would kill my Blog if I were to type it out here. So I'll leave it with this: I met Kate 4 years ago this September at orchestra. To call her my better half would be an injustice against her as a human being. We're best of friends; she's my red-headed sidekick, forever at my side (if not physically, then spiritually). As a despairing Catharine Earnshaw says to Nelly in  Wuthering Heights , "I  am  Heathcliff," so am I Kate.  I couldn't talk about friends without including Jeff. If Brian, Nate and Kyle are my bros, then Jeff is most certainly my best friend. He's the lead guitarist in my band, Beermouse. Jeff and I have been going to the same school since grade 7, but we only really got to be friends in grade 10, when we were both part of our school production of  Macbeth . Jeff is quite intelligent, and quite excellent at completely ignoring that fact until it serves his purpose. He can be very charming and sophisticated (naturally, my parents love any of my friends that can discuss Stravinsky instead of sports) when he wants to, and a downright dick others. He knows how to push buttons, both the right ones and the wrong ones.  Finally there's Alison. I've known her for less than a year, but we're very close nonetheless. She's one of those rare people who gets to be beautiful, talented,  and  brilliant (well, rare in Oakville. We had plenty of them at Shad). I've decided I'm going to marry her someday. Others have pointed out that she might not feel the same way, but I feel it's  fate /  Anyhow, I think I've just told you all that about my home-dawgs without actually telling you anything about them. Maybe later. I'm tired and need a nap.  Cheers from the basement, - Cary (aka Donut O)   *That's something from Zoolander, for all the uncultured swine in the audience. Although I do think it's closer.
