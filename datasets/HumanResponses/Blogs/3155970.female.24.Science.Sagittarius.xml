      From what I see on Oprah, being a mom is a tough job.  I'm sure my own mother would agree with that.  She served as cook, chauffer, tutor, maid, butler, self-help guru, bread winner, and referee to both my sister and for many years and even now still.  But when my momther entered into this contract of never ending servitude she was in her twenties and already married.  Her struggles began after she left my father and had to raise us on her own.  Congrats to her because she did a great job (obviously I have no issues).  But should the same congratulations be given to all women that sacrifice their lives for motherhood?  Should we put teen moms on a pedestal and admire their sacrifice?  Hell no!!!  Yes motherhood is difficult, fatherhood is difficult.  Raising children is tough and that should be beat into the heads of every man women and child.  Honoring a 19 year-old girl for having a 3 year-old kid is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of.  Instead she should be told what a dumb fuck she is for getting knocked up and use her as an example for all little boys and girls for what not to become when you are 16...a mom or a dad.  At 19 you are still a baby and shouldn't be raising one.  Yes accidents happen everyday and what is fun and exciting for 10 minutes can lead to a lifetime of hard work and servitude.    So you got knocked up at 16 and decided to have the baby, sacrificing whatever sort of life you have led in order to be a mom.  Good for you, here's a cookie.  But don't parade your ass on TV and say shit like "I'm a mom so I deserve a break."  No you don't deserve anything, what you should have gotten was a kick upside the head for being stupid at 16.

      This past Sunday I got stuck in downtown DC due to the pro-choice march down Pennsylvania Ave.  I'm not really passionate about any causes enough to march around a city block for hours but I don't mind watching.  Its great to see people come together to fight for a cause, to see unity among men and women all of different backgrounds, colors, ages, and sexual preferences.  To see people peacefully expressing their opinions.  What is not good to see is flabby guts spilling out of belly shirts, fat chicks dressed as belly dancers shaking all over the place, and ugly guys with full beards dressed as women.  This wasn't a peaceful protest march it was a cry for help!!!  "Please help me because I look like I fell off the ugly truck."  If I were a guy looking to get laid I would definitely had made to go to a pro-choice march because you know all the chicks there would soooooooooo put out.  I'm glad however I am not a guy because I would have been sooooooooooooo turned off by all the uggies in the crowd.  I have never seen a larger gathering of nasty, fat, disgusting looking women in all my life.   I know, I know, I am a women and I should be behind all of my "sisters" and feel proud to see so many of them not giving a damn what society thinks and letting their big flappy guts fly.  Fuck that!!!  It was nasty and if I had eaten something before going to the march I would have heaved it all over them.

      A good question that I ask myself all the time.  "What is wrong with my life?"  Nothing really, I have a job that challenges me everyday, a job that I have wanted and now I have.  Not a job but a career, how many people fresh out of college get their dream job?  Not many but I was among the lucky few, so why am I unhappy.   I want more with my life, but what is that "more" that I want?  I can't put my finger on it and it is killing me.  I compare myself to too many other people.  Somedays I look at things that I have done and the places I have traveled and I feel satisified and happy until I remember that others have traveled more than me and have seen more than I have seen and then I am back to being unhappy.  I have married friends, engaged friends, actively dating friends, and single friends.  I don't want to be married or engaged but I feel lonely without someone there to cuddle with or to laugh with.  I date even though it is hard at times but still its fun.  I would prefer something more permanent.  My mom has a social phobia, so does my sister.  I believe that I have this but to a lesser degree.  I get nervous when I think about going out alone.  I think everyone is laughing at me.  "Look at the fat girl sitting alone," they all say in my head.  "She is pathetic and had no friends."  My head tells me that I am full of shit for thinking this but still I sit in my apartment alone.  I have my own apartment, car, dog, mailbox key, phone and answering machine.  I have a coffee maker with lots of yummy coffee.  I can get up in the morning and make coffee naked if I want and sometimes do.  I love thinking about the things that I have, it makes me happy, but something is missing and I don't know what it is.  I have narrowed it down to loneliness, but in what form.    I have a friend that says that I am not lonely because I have my family nearby.  We have different meanings of the term lonely.  My family is nearby and his isn't.  He is lonely without them.  He is outgoing and fun and has lots of friends and girlfriends.  I am shy and somewhat of a introvert.  I don't have lots of friend or boyfriends.  I am lonely without that.  Most nights I just go to sleep and forget about it.  I don't know how much longer I will do this.  I need to get over this social phobia thing I have I guess.  Its killing me.

      I don't like people, actually I hate 90% of the people that I come in contact with.  So is it horrible to hate most people?  No, and I will tell you why.    Everyone has issues, whether it is because your father abused your mother when you were younger, or your mom abandoned you as a child, you are stuck in a career that makes you feel empty, or you married for money.  Whatever the reason you, me, the guy next door, and the chick banging dudes alley we all have issues.  How you decide to handle the issues you have will determine whether or not you deserve to be hated by me or anyone else in the world.  So you are stuck in a shit job so you are rude and nasty and lazy all day at work.  I hate you.    You lost 100 pounds by starving yourself and over exercising but you still feel fat on the inside and all day long you beat yourself up over how horrible you look and how you will never be beautiful.  I hate you.  Sometimes I hate for silly superficial reasons but that is only after the person has opened their mouth and said something stupid.  And I bet you are wondering now, who don't you hate?   Well I don't hate intelligent people, so there you go.

      I need sleep.  I just got home from work and I am tired.  Work as in my part-time job at a coffeehouse is DC.  All the coffee I drank isn't going to keep me awake at this point.  Some man came into the coffee shop and gave me and my co-worker Kasey some advice.  "Never get married and have lots of anonymous sex with bike messengers."  I can't make this stuff up I swear.  Lots of weird people come in and out of the coffeehouse and say the strangest things, it makes work more fun, that and all the free coffee.  So now I sleep while watching You've Got Mail for the 100th time and maybe later I will workout OR clean-up.  Not both and maybe neither.

      What do you do when you don't know what to do?  When you don't know whether to eat or not?  To exercise or not?  To go out or not?  To stay home or not?   How do you know if you are giving the right answers for your questions or asking the right questions to be answered?    Tonight is another night where I don't know what to do because doing something will result in something being done or a need being satisfied and that is just to overwhelming for me.  So many choices that I don't know which to pick and if I don't pick I will just end up sitting here all night and nothing will get done and I will kick myself.  So if not picking a choice results in nothing getting done because having too many choices is so overwhelming to pick then why is having only one choice so frustrating?  (Oh god I hate myself sometimes.)  I don't know what to do because anything I do will come out with the same result: I'll still be bored and talking to a dog.  I would so much rather being bored and talking to a human and hanging out with a human and making fun of other odd looking humans with another human.  Ahhhhhhh so I guess I need human friends!!  Well DUH I knew that all along.   I'm too independent.  If I were more needy and pathetic then I would have more friends, or if the stupid friends that I have weren't so stupid then I would have someone to hang out with. Stupid fucking humans.

      I have decided to start running again.    But you are so lazy how can this be???   Well I would like to lose some weight and this is the best and quickest way to do so.   Yeah you are pretty fat.   Fuck you.  I used to run 3 miles 3 times a week.  Sure to those psycho marathon runners that is nothing but for me that is something.   Whatever.   Lately I have been working out to a work out video and its been pretty cool.  I have all these muscles that no one can see because they are buried under layers of fat.  Of course I would like to see the fruits of my labor so I will run off all the fat.  I bought a cute stop watch to time myself when running and eventually I will buy myself some new running clothes so that I will look cute while running (that is very important). Also exercise is suppose to make you happy and I guess that is a plus seeing as how I tend to...sometimes...on occassion...not be so happy.    So in conclusion, I am fat, will run to lose fat and gain happiness through the release of neurotransmitters. :)

      I have no interests in anything.  I care about nothing.  Right now my only interests are eating and drinking but I'm not even interested enough to go to the store to buy food and booze.  I exercise because its what I'm suppose to do.  I go to work because I have no choice.  I pay bills for fear of what will happen if I don't.  I walk the dog because if I don't she'll piss on my clothes.  However I do put a lot of effort into budgeting my finances.  I shouldn't even be able to afford to live where I do but with the right kind tweaking I get by just fine AND still have money to buy my booze and food when I'm not being lazy and depressed on the bed.  Sometimes I think life would be simpler if I had a sugar daddy as long as I didn't have to kiss him or sleep with him.  If all I had to do was to be his arm candy for a few nights a week it would be perfect.  But eventually I am sure that he would pop a few Viagra and want to do it so or else I wouldn't get my money.  To avoid that senario I would rather just not involve myself with that sort of lifestyle.  So I am back to being disinterested with life, at least for the rest of this week.

      So on Sundays I work in a "gourmet" coffeeshop preparing over priced coffee for yuppies in gang infested neighborhood in DC (Its called gentrification but we'll save that for another blog).  Its amazing what how addictive coffee is and how those of us that are addictive (yeah that includes me) feel we can't begin our day without our morning cup of personality.  However myself and my bank account have evolved to reject the other priced coffee drinks because they are a waste of money but not to these yuppies.  And in addition to taking their $4 for an espresso drink my colleagues and I also have the nerve to set out a tip cup to further bleed our customers dry.  I feel bad taking charging a ton of money for coffee but do I feel bad about taking thier extra change as a tip OF COURSE NOT!!!!  My first day I got $21 in tips.  The next day I only got $14.  Why such a decrease in my earnings???  Same number of people came in, they all bought the same drinks as the weekend before, so why less money.  The next week was the same, $14, and the week after, $14.  WHERE IS MY EXTRA $7????  I GOT A DOG TO FEED HERE PEOPLE!!!!!  And then it came to me.  The proverbial lightbulb went off in my head.  My first day I wore a tight shirt and smiled a lot, and the following weeks I wore loose fitting clothes, I still smiled but not as much.  So I decided to do what any money strapped woman with a dog to feed and DD sized breasts would do, show cleavage.  I wore a low-cut shirt and stuck my chest up for all the customers to see and it worked great.  Guys were smiling at me and shoving money in the tip cup like there was no tomorrow, even the women customers were digging in their wallets for change.  My tips for yesterday...$16.50, not great but up from $14.  The only problem was that I wasn't at the cash register the entire time, part of the time I had to make the espresso drinks which made me disconnected from my customers and them disconnected from my breasts.  Also the girl that I was working with was very flat chested and spacey, customers don't like that.   So what are the key points here???  When working for tips you must A) smile and have a cheery attitude B) show some cleavage and C) don't be a space cadet.  End of lesson.

      I think that I have a problem, an addiction you might say to romantic comedies.  I want to punch myself over this.  Every weekend I pop in one of my DVDs and watch these overly, unrealistic movies with perfect couples saying the perfect thing to win each other over. One might think that I am living in a fantasy land where I hope that one day a man will sweep me off my feet with the perfect line, gift, or with his quirky behavior.  Ugh I am not that naive, I just like seeing people happy and laughing.  All my DVDs really are comedies but I am partial to the romantic ones.

      Tarvor decided during his trip to Vegas that life was no longer worth living so he jumped to his death. Luckily someone had the forethought to tie a rope to his feet just in case something like this was going to happen.    urlLink Tarvor Jumps

      The resume is being sent out and in my head the going away party is happening as we speak.  I'm looking for a new job.    Apparently the powers that be here at my place of employment want me to be underpaid and overqualified babysitter for a 60-year-old idiot woman.  I have put up with a lot at this job.  I have given up weekends, come everyday for a month, stayed late, deal with being paid less than people that I do much better work than, and work under the most annoying, stupid, and dim-witted man on the planet and now this.  I will not rest until I have found another job.  I don't care that I will be losing this beautiful notebook, which I have grown very fond of, nor do I care that I will be leaving behind friends that I have made and enjoy laughing with.  Somethings are more important like my sanity and my bank account.  Boys and girls of the world hear me now.  Never let someone tell you that you do not have a choice.  You always have a choice.  I could choose to stay at my job and work with these miserable excuses for human beings or I can choose to take on new challenges and meet new miserable excuses for human beings.  Right now all I know is that any movement is better than no movement at all.

       Have fun today, [GIRL]. Put your worries aside and live this day as if it were your last on Earth. Keep a light and cheery outlook on life and don't dwell on minor mishaps. This is a day to enjoy the sunshine and keep smiling no matter what circumstances may arise. You will find that your good mood is contagious, and that pretty soon you will be the pied piper of good cheer and a positive attitude.   This is the dumbass horoscope that I received in my e-mail today.  Perfect day for stupid ass advice seeing as how I am back to hating everyone I come in contact with, especially men...wait let me correct myself...BOYS!  Every man is a boy and every boy is just a smaller, younger, and stupider version of what he will grow up to be.  Sometimes I think that I would be better off if I were a lesbian but then I remember that women are over-emotional crybabies and drive people crazy.  The real problem is is that men think that they are right in their dumbass thinking and so do women.  We are both right and need to find a common ground with each other.  If you don't want to compromise your thinking at all then don't fucking talk to me because I am going to stop listening after you express your first narrow-minded, dumbfuck thought.  What might be surprising to all is that I am not the sort of person that is going to tell you after the first of talking with you exactly how I feel about you, I just won't talk to you anymore.  Why should I waste my breath explaining why I don't like you when I could just walk away and pretend as if I don't know?  The latter is less aggrevating for myself.  Let someone else beat themselves over the head trying to knock sense into yours.  So as of this moment I am through with people.  You are all stupid, self-centered fucks with bad taste and horrible table manners.

       choice   (n)  - 1.The act of choosing; selection. 2.The power, right, or liberty to choose; option.   Having a choice suggests that there is an opportunity or privilege of choosing freely.  We as humans make choices everyday whether they be bad or good, right or wrong, a choice is a choice.  Last night I made a choice to take a walk with my dog to Starbucks and buy a fattening yet tasty drink.  On the way back an opossum crossed our path.  I'm not sure if it saw us or not but I did call to it not to walk into the street and when it did WHAM! it was hit by a car and then a second car.  I stood there watching it struggle for life for about a minute then it died.  For some reason I felt the urge to cry but I didn't because it was a stupid rodent that made a choice to walk out into the middle of the street and get hit by a car, or did it?  Seeing the blood ooze from the mouth of this larger and uglier version of a rat made me glad that I walk my dog on a leash so that something like that won't happen to her because animals don't seem to make logical choices they just seem to act on instinct.  But maybe I caused the opossum to run into the street.  Could it have made the choice to either a) face an enemy (me and my dog) or b) run away in the other direction?  Maybe if I didn't go to Starbucks last night the opossum would still be alive now and having opossum-style sex with a mate.  But alas the creature is dead and life goes on and in the world of streets with big cars opossums cannot compete but this is where Darwin steps in with his theories.  Dumb, slow moving opossums will be killed by cars but smart and quick opossums won't and so in years to come downtown Alexandria will be full of the faster smarter breed.  Or the tiny opossums with thin, weak skulls will die but the bigger ones with thick skulls will hold up to the weight of cars and soon the species will the size of big dogs.  All I know is that because I was struggling with the choice to either pay my rent increase or move, caused me to choose talk on the phone all night instead or make dinner, which then caused me to make a choice to walk to Starbucks with the dog to buy a fattening drink, which caused the opossum to make a choice to walk in the street and get hit by a car.

      I'm going back to school!!!!  Its not grad school but its a step to grad school.  At the end of June I will be taking Calculus because I need the class in order to go back to school.    I am such a nerd.  I had to take a placement test at the Community College I will be attending to see what math level I could take and naturally I placed in all levels so I can take anything I want.  (Save the ooohs and ahhhs I know that I am smart).  I'm so excited about about going to class and studying but what I am most excited about is buying school supplies.  I LOVE school supplies!!!!  But what is even better than buying my own school supplies is stealing them from work!!!!!!  Pens, pencils, highlighter, stick pads, 3-ring binders, paper, notebooks, oh god I am getting sooooooooo excited.  I need a cool drink.    I'm sure that after the first week of class I will be crying and complaining about how I wish I was bored again with nothing to do after work, but for now I will be excited and drinking cool drinks until then.

      I have but a few moments to write a bit about my life for the past couple of weeks in a short paragraph.&nbsp; I wanted to jot down my feelings about people.&nbsp; People are stupid, especially when those people are your friends.&nbsp; Your "friends" (I put friends in quotation marks because if these people were really my friends then they wouldn't act like jerks) expect you to always be there for them when their car dies, when they need a couple of bucks, when they want to go to the movies etc.&nbsp; Or when they are bored at work they call you expecting you to answer because you are always so happy to be their interest when they have nothing else to.&nbsp; They don't call you when they have free time to romp and frolick.&nbsp; They don't call you when they know that you are on your last dollar and really bummed out about your shit job and could use a laugh.&nbsp; No these people only think about themselves and what you can do or can't do for them and they call themselves your "friend." So instead of sitting around the house waiting to be someone's last resort you dust off your dancing shoes and hit the town, ALONE.&nbsp; You make new friends, discover new interest and make your own plans.&nbsp; Then your "friends" start to call you again since now their new friends are boring to them and they want to return to good 'ol reliable you, but now you have a life and are too busy having fun to be bothered by someone who didn't have the time to be bothered with you.&nbsp;  So what does your "friend" do?&nbsp; Accuse you of being the type of person that would ignore their friends for some guy, which is what that person has done to you.&nbsp; Well with friends like that who needs them at all.

      Today will be my second day of calculus class.  I was so happy last night as I did my math homework.  Its been awhile since I have sat down in front on the TV to do math and it felt great.  Working out problems with my little pencil and my little calculator.  I felt at peace with the world. Last night I bought some yarn and some ribbon so that I can knit my new project (I just completed a furry scarf) and when I got home I had received my knitting needles from ebay, but I didn't dare knit a single stitch because I had calculus homework and school comes first!!!!!  I LOVE SCHOOL!!!!!  I want to be the best student ever!!!!!  I will crush my classmates by receiving perfect on all exams and being the teacher's pet.  Laaa laaa dee da!!!
