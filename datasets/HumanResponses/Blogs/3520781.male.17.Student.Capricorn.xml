      Everything has been going really wrong tis june holidays. My younger brother was a total idiot.... Gave him a chance to play in basketball team again & yet he still takes it for granted, tis no the 3rd time... yet tis is the 5th chance tat we have gave him.... Yet, he shows his gone damn fucKinG BloodY attitude.. As if the whole world owe it to him.... My mum & dad are really in a sorry state now.....especially my mum, who constantly worry for my brother.... whenever i see her in tat sad state, i can't help but think why my brother dosen't change a single bit..... We lay down rules for him so tat he could  return back to basketball.... yet he dosen't really follow them.... still shows his fucking attitude last nite.... my mum got really pissed off while trying to call his teacher in charge & the sch.... but all she could get was no answer.... Damn fucking retarded the school.... i still can understand if the teacher turn off their phone, but no able to get through the school phone is another matter.... Now she is off to sch to find my brother.... In another few days time i am about to start sch.... i wonder how all tis problem at home are going to be by then.... all i could do is pray tat it ends soon...... So much problem like tis, yet my brother of mine thinks tat tis is all nothing.....

      Finally got my new phone at last.....Nokia 6230!!(i noe some pple thinks its not really tat great aniwae, plus its price is like very high, still i like tat phone....) but now i still have to let it charge for at least another 8hrs or so.... Spend like the whole day at home watching Tv & sitting in front of the computer. Yesterdae went back to sch to help out with the training of P.A members in school, was glad to see Midsean, Shao ming & ivan as well. simon also came back to sch to help out as well, so did Dennis.... Non the less, it was enjoyable helping them out, then there was tis boy by the name of guan wei, really had some attitude prob. but still i found tis guy rather amusing.... He could do lots of stuff in a really short time, at first i thought he was one the real trouble maker in the CCa... but still, he proved me wrong & now i think that keeping him in P.A may come in handy.... Well, anyway, the whole group of us( Dennis, Simon, Me, Midsean, Shao Ming & Ivan) met up with Eddie, Caspar & Lead Whye, to have dinner with both our ex P.A teachers, Ms Lim SH & Ms Tan CK for dinner @ Plaza Singapore. We had Pastamania tat nite & could u imagine tat ms lim (now teaching in RI) treated the whole lot of us for dinner, tat has been like the 3rd time she treated such a grp like us... we were really grateful.... After dinner, we all went upstairs to the 1st floor where we sat at Macdonalds open air tables, & chat for another 2 hours before leaving.... But still, i had to go back to school todae to get my 'O' level cert which i left it with Shao ming the dae before.... so forgetful of me..... Bought the music CD 'Speed Up', i think its a crap CD, knew i shldn't have bought it.... Around 8pm 2dae, my whole family went out together for a walk at AMK.... i just hope 2molo will be a good dae as i would be heading down to the GYM to sweat my fats out, hope 2molo will really be good to sweat off my excess Fats.....
