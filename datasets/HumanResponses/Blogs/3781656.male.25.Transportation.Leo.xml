						   I've been thinking about the morality of mocking people. I think we do it because we have to appear better than the next guy in order to attract people like Connie Chung and David Schwimmer. And the easiest way to do that is not to work on actually being the best guy, but to bring down the next guy so that you seem like you're better.  It's easy to call the woman with a beard ugly, the man who gets airlifted out of his house on Geraldo because he weighs eight hundred pounds fat, and the teenager who does not know the alphabet stupid. But it's not so easy to volunteer to shave the woman's beard, or pilot the helicopter hauling the man out of the house, or go down to the local McDonalds to pick up an application for the illiterate. No one is perfect, and we should remember that the next time we are making fun of white males and others whom life has dealt a difficult hand.

						   The woman who runs my house would make a good mate for Dick Cheney. She is obsessive, conniving, and foams at the mouth.  I live in a group house. I'm never going to do it again, or at least, not unless I've flown my prospective housemates to Vienna to be examined by a random Austrian. Those people know how to sniff out weirdos, and when they do, they send them to America to touch boobies and become governors.  I'll tell you more about Dick's lover, and the Formosan male housemate who gets Victoria's Secret, a little later.

						   I work, as many do, at a large corporation that exploits Canadian labor to produce goods of shoddy quality with high price tags. My work requires an intellectual backbone but no legs. Indeed, the only physical labor I perform each day is to get into my chair, and had I an East German maid handy, I would not even need to do that myself.  Sometimes I look out my window at the road below, hoping that a deer, elk, or moose cross it and create some excitement. But the deer, elk, and moose were all killed years ago by the first Republicans, who came to our country in the late seventies to escape persecution by Dirk Nowitzki's mother, who was, and remains, awfully tall. So instead I work and ponder the great mysteries of life, many of which concern people's reluctance to use the word "phlegmatic" in casual discourse.

						   I hesitated before getting a blog. I don't like the sound of it. "Blog." Not much good rhymes with it. But more importantly, I know someone who writes a livejournal, and he's got some real problems. He likes to use his livejournal to tell folks what he buys at the supermarket. That's not that interesting. It's a little interesting, because he buys a lot of food, but really not all that interesting. I think you have to be a little arrogant to start one. Who cares about what you think, unless you are Macauley Culkin? Maybe it's just important to be entertaining and not take yourself too seriously. All I know is that I need a distraction from work.

						   A co-worker of mine refers to her lover as "partner." I thought that was awesome, until I found out that my co-worker's lover is a man.  I could understand the nomenclature if my co-worker were a cowboy. Not only do cowboys like to use the word "partner," but cowboys are men, and if she were a man, she could refer to her male lover as "partner" because she'd be pretty damn gay.  But this just doesn't make sense.

						   The other day I saw a woman try to use her Giant Bonus Card to get a discount on pants at Nordstroms.  Someone, I think it was a neoconservative, shat on my car the same day.  I moved out of the group house. The woman who runs the house was a little sad, perhaps because she knew there would be one fewer person to watch her act like Satan. The Taiwanese housemate doesn't like to watch her act like Satan. He prefers to order lingerie from Victoria's Secret for himself. He can be nasty sometimes.

						   Have you ever noticed how George Bush "looks forward" to addressing any controversial matter reporters remind him about rather than actually addressing it?  He "looks forward" to meeting with the 9-11 commission He "looks forward" to figuring out what went wrong with the intelligence in Iraq. He "looks forward" to having a debate with the American people about the issues.  We have to hope that he also "looks forward" to getting kicked out of the White House, living the rest of his life as an object of ridicule and scorn by most of the country, and going down as the worst president ever.

						   Dick Cheney's would-be lover was at it again last night. She was in a bad mood, so she took all the toilet paper from the bathroom and went into her room. Who does that?   It's her house. If she wants people to walk on her rugs with sloppy bowels, that's her prerogative. I think it's kind of nasty.  She likes writing sticky-notes to tell her tenants what they are doing wrong. But she didn't write one to tell us about why she had absconded with the toilet paper. It's a shame, because I would have used it to wipe my ass.

						   One thing that irritates me is people who dress their dogs. Another is people who say that they are going to do something that they have no intention of doing out of a false compulsion to be nice or to make a token effort to fulfill their own moral expectations of themselves.  I've done it, and I don't blame my friends when they do it. But I find it really obnoxious when others do it.  I've been thinking that maybe we could all stop doing it. For this, I think we need to look to our nation's reigning moral authority, George W. Bush.  We all know the situation. You've had a date in which the other's person excessive flatulence has disappointed you. Or you're stuck in a conversation with an old middle school acquaintance who wants to get together with you to relive the old days. Maybe an aspiring benefactor wants to take to a museum on 16th century carpentry because you once mentioned that your house is partly made of wood.  In all cases, the other person is good-intentioned. As a result, you don't want to hear their feelings. You're not willing to say to the girl, "Hey, I was a bit disconcerted by the incontinence of your anus. I don't understand why you felt the need to snack on Beefarino before our date. I'm sorry, but you've ejaculated more nastiness in one evening than I could ever dream of hooking up with you, your putrid stench rendering my bodily organs incapable of doing anything but looking like they had just return from a foray outside the Village, and consequently I see no point pursuing this any further other than to suggest that you buy some Pepto-Bismol and try your luck with a deaf hippopotamus.  So instead of saying the truth, you say something like "I'll call you," or "this was fun."  In the case of the old acquaintance from middle school, you want to say, "You're a nice guy, but I don't really remember us talking in middle school. In fact, Pappy, the only time I remember you talking was when I was taking a dump in the library bathroom one Friday and you came in, looked at the mirror, and said "If I don't get some pussy this weekend, I'm going to burst." I saw it happen through the crack, Pappy. I don't remember your bursting on Monday, so maybe you succeeded, but I don't think we could talk about that for more than a couple of minutes. The reality is that we probably would have become friends on any one of the 600 days we spent together were we ever meant to be friends. Maybe you've changed, and maybe I've changed, but I don't want to beat a dead horse by getting together to talk about the people we knew in middle school and the things that we saw. I've beaten the middle school horse enough with my own friends, and we need to inter that mess along with Kurt Cobain and the Bee Girl. I've killed my high school horse five hundred times, and now I am well on to molesting the carcass of the college horse. Pretty soon I'll start looking for a new horse to beat, but yours isn't it. Sorry, Pappy, but I think you're better off just getting some pussy this weekend."  But instead you decide to tell Pappy, "yeah, I'll call you," or "I'm eager to catch up."  In the final instance, the case of the person who wants to take you to some museum because they seem to have the impression you'd be interested in it, you are inclined to say, "It is true that my house is partly made of wood, but I have no interest in learning more about the use of wood in earlier time periods, or even today. I am not a carpenter, nor did I ever tell you that I was interested in carpentry. In fact the last time I heard carpentry discussed in a remotely interesting way was that movie with Owen Wilson and the Focker. You clearly recognize that you are a complete lunatic if you go to a museum on 16th century carpentry, and therefore want me to go with you so you do not feel like such a neoconservative. You really should admit to yourself that you have bizarre tastes and not transfer them to others. Had I ever mentioned to you that I wanted to go to an historical museum of wood, I would have said, "I would like to go an historical museum of wood." But what you've done here is disingenuous, awkward, and psychotic. I encourage you to go about your task of recreating the kind of chair that William Shakespeare would have sat in, and sit in it until you feel like you have been enlightened by the experience. Meanwhile I will sit in my 21st-century recliner, eat a peach, and stare off into space. Let's see who needs the hemorrhoidectomy first."  You never say those words, of course, but instead say, "I'll call you," or "let's do it."  And of course you don't call, and you don't do it.  But you should feel bad about that, because it's not right to lie. It hurts someone's feelings as much as telling the full truth. What you need to do is to have your cake and eat it, too. And the person who can teach you how is none other than George W. Bush, an exemplar of intellect, righteousness, and equity; a paragon of virtue, wit, and wisdom; a Ms. Manners, Dear Abby, and Dr. Phil in one. Ask yourself, for all of these situations, what would Dubya do?  It seems to me, based on the sort of observation techniques I learned from either Jane Goodall or Diane Fossey, whichever one wasn't killed by her monkeys, that Dubya would be able to navigate himself through this treacherous moral conundrum with aplomb, like Odysseus past Scylla and Charybdis, avoiding both the guilt of having lied and the "untidiness" --to quote Rumsfeld--of the consequences of telling the truth. To do so, he would either make profoundly stupid comments or jokes, or impart incontrovertible generalities, the sort that are so mind-numbingly obvious or so hopelessly irrelevant that you are unable to muster any sort of reply but thank yourself for not having to spend any more time around what clearly is a very stupid and intellectually unsophisticated person. Dubya has employed this practice for years and it has gotten him out of many a scrape.  We saw it just last week when Dubya explained that tribal sovereignty meant "just that--it's sovereign."  So to the girl, following Dubya's example, you might say...   "Dinners, well, they come after lunches. And lunches come after breakfasts. But breakfasts come after dinners, if you don't count the time that you sleep. In other words, we eat food."  "Don't worry about it. I flagellate myself sometimes."  "9/11 was bad."   To the middle school acquaintance:   "Middle school. Well, some agitators like to call that 'Junior High.' But is it really the son of 'Senior High?' It doesn't make sense, Pappy."  "I know it's hard not getting tail, Pappy. But have faith, and remember that Jesus spent his life a virgin."  "I would enjoy seeing you, but I must fight terror."   To the person who wants to take you to a museum:   "I don't know much about sixteenth-century wood. I'm more interested in the morning wood."  "I don't believe in museums, or gnomes."  "It's important that we preserve our knowledge of wood. It's used to build buildings, facilities, and establishments. In other words, what high-faluting Washington types call infra-red structure."   By debasing yourself--acting like the President--a person will not at all feel offended by the fact that you don't want to see them. They will be happy for it. I have begun to respect Dubya in a whole new light, as his example should be useful to anyone looking to avoid embarrassing supplicants for their attention. All you have to do is be unintelligible, unintelligent, and Captain Obvious, and the often parlous world of courtesy and manners will undoubtedly become your ulcer.

						   I've often wondered whether our nation's president has the relations with his wife. There are many reasons why he would. These go to 11.  One, he believes it's good for Ameerca.  Two, he feels he should heed the word of scripture, which forbids him from sleeping with oxen.  Three, she's not bad looking for someone who married an idiot.  Four, due to Laura's age, there's no danger of creating any more idiot children.  Five, it's more fun than reading, governing, or getting lousy hand jobs from Andy Card.  Six, Bill Clinton probably has.  Seven, he believes it's good for Ameerca.  Eight, he remembers 9/11.  Nine, he's always enjoyed Doggy-Style.  Ten, Laura was the First Lady who did not think that he was an idiot.  Eleven, he believes it's good for ... and he remembers 9/11 ... and some people don't want to fight the terrorists... his penis is strong, and growing stronger every day... there's an old saying in Tennessee, i think it's Tennessee, it's definitely Texas--splooge me once, shame on you....splooge me twice...you can't get splooged again...i'll never let the international community tell me i can't splooge...  But whether or not Bush gets it on with his wife, Bush gives off a sort-of comforting "I'm not a sexual freak" vibe. To date, he has not been caught in a picture giving thumbs up to Paul Wolfowitz's fetid, naked crotch before a Mission Accomplished banner. Yet.  This sexual restraint has been lacking in some past presidents. As far as we can tell, Clinton and Kennedy couldn't keep their pants on. FDR was reputed to be a philanderer also, but it must have been hard being married to Eleanor Roosevelt. I think before that not much is known of American leaders pushing norms of acceptable sexual behavior, but there are antecedents in the classical period.  Next time you read Tacitus--I know it'll be soon--count how many Roman Emperors banged a horse within weeks of becoming Emperor. When things got really bad, they turned to their sisters and children. Nero, Caligula, that guy in Gladiator, the list goes on.  So we can applaud Bush for not being an adulterous sexual deviant prone to pederasty and bestiality. Indeed, because Bush sleeps with his wife, and not an ox, it could be said that Bush is good for Ameerca. It is clearly one of his more notable achievements, that of not sleeping with an ox.  Karl Rove should capitalize on it. He would be wise to make this the Bush campaign slogan in Middle America-- "John Kerry Sleeps with Oxen." Even though there is no evidence that John Kerry has ever slept with an ox, or even seen one--has anyone seen an ox since the end of the nineteenth century?--he is from Massachusetts, and we all know how Yankees can be.  The people will nod their heads and believe it to be true. "I saw Kerry sleep with an ox with my own eyes," they'll say.  But this is all secondary to the start of the NFL preseason. On this, morons and anti-Bush folks can agree.

						   Last night I watched some UPN, the Urine and Poo Network of broadcast television. I don't think I had watched it since  Moesha , which I enjoyed because it reminded me of my childhood. Like Moesha's dad, my father also unfairly prevented me from going out with guys named "Q." When the Urine and Poo Network took  Moesha  off the air, cruelly robbing me of the opportunity to ever again tell my mom, "I'll do my AP Calc homework after  Moesha, " I swore that I'd never watch the Urine and Poo Network again.  But last night I found myself watching UPN's premiere of  The Player , a ghetto reality romance show featuring white Casanovas pretending to be black, black Casanovas pretending to be white, and Hispanic Casanovas being Hispanic, all for the sake of winning a modern-day Penelope. Overcoming my animosity over the  Moesha  situation, I was directed to this piece of programming by no less erudite a publication that the New York Times, which gave  The Player  a glowing review. This I could not understand until I was introduced to the woman whose affections fifteen men play for in the series, Dawn. It became clear that the New York Times reviewer in fact owns one of those rare penises that responds to environmental stimuli, overrides all rational thought, and corrupts professional judgment. This woman is bling-bling, drop-dead gorgeous in a way that doesn't normally grow in the wild. Adding to her attraction is the fact that she is racially multitudinous; as the Times says after quoting one of her idiotic reflections, "with that elegant suggestion, it becomes clear that Dawn, whose accent shifts elegantly from black to white depending on the situation, is an inspired choice for this amusing show about courtship." It's called she's hot, and it doesn't matter if she's too stupid to remember her own accent. (And for women easily offended by the sexist nature of that comment, recall Patrick Swayze, who girls think is hot but took most of "Ghost" to figure out how to move his non-existent body through a goddamn door.)  The suitors are a boorish group, consisting of folks named Acie, Cheyno, and Eian. Each like to talk about their "game," which as far as I could tell just consisted of being obnoxious and good-looking, requisite characteristics for anyone interested in scoring the kinds of women who show up on reality dating shows. I liked Federico, who put on a breakdance last night which culminated with him awkwardly hopping into a pool with his pants on. Other people performed rap songs, poetry, and comedy in order to impress Dawn. Taken as a whole, these pre-mating rituals made me wonder why we don't look to the goats when trying to put on a show for the opposite sex. Butt heads and whinny; it'd be no less stupid and would serve a useful self-esteem boost to goats, who've never had it easy but have been even further marginalized under the Bush administration.  The men had not only to impress Dawn, but also the two lesser models she refers to her as "my girls." I think "my idiots" would have been as accurate a description, but who am I to quibble over Dawn's diction? She can't remember her accent. These two girls, Ananda and Jinelle, are alike in that their names are one letter away from being normal. No doubt they changed their names from normal to not normal when they became models, as they are not as hot as Dawn and need that extra bit of uniqueness to make it in a highly competitive occupation in which failure means that you get spit out of the bottom of the porn industry. (For those who think that at the very least, models get free meals each night from horny benefactors, remember that they cannot actually eat the meals. Or so my hot high school friend Eliqabeth once told me. She really did.)  Ananda and Jinelle are kinda like the two assistants that helped Trump in  The Apprentice.  Ananda is like the blonde assistant who looks like she'd kill you after mating. She's got a stick in her ass, and it smells. Jinelle is like the old man; she's kinda fun but you suspect she's got VD. But in being less hot than Dawn, they serve their purpose, as they remind us that Dawn is insanely hot, just as Trump's assistants remind us no one is as hard-core as the Donald.  Together, Dawn and her girls are faced with some difficult challenges, the paramount of which is determining which of the goons is a genuinely good guy. Last night the triumvirate decided that Federico wasn't good enough, perhaps because Jinelle and Ananda were upset that he had pulled the same trick with his name that they had. The girls will also have to choose which of the two players who listed Ashton Kutcher as their number one role model on the show's website will go first. And what will they do with the guy who listed himself as his role model?  I know; I really shouldn't look at the website of the Urine and Poo Network. But I'm mildly fascinated by this restyled, renamed version of the  Bachelorette , if only because it's a racially diverse group of egomaniacs, rather than the homegenous collections that show will give you. And as long as the Times says it's good, I won't be ashamed to watch it. The insight it provides into American culfure is undeniable.

						   So America lost to Italy in basketball today. It's kind of like a really swarthy, hairy David beating Goliath, upon the conclusion of which David gropes a few women and eats some spaghetti. That's really what it's like.  It's a bad sign when America is losing basketball games. We invented it, or maybe it was some Canadian guy, but I don't make a habit of distinguishing the nationalities except when foreigners have done bad things. The point is that it's our sport, it's our baby and maybe Shawn Kemp's too. Maybe we're not as good anymore because we can't shoot as well, our teams haven't practiced together like the other teams, or we're not hungry. But it would never make sense. How the hell does Allen Iverson not scare the hell out of the other team? The man is a virtual ghetto fresco on wheels. How can you guard a painting in corn rows that can dunk? And what about Tim Duncan? He's got a really long face. I wouldn't play my best knowing that face were looking at me. You can go down the line--Lebron James, Lamar Odom, Emeka Okafor--and find players whose names haven't even been thought of in Europe; you would think that would knock the foreigners off their game.  But apparently it doesn't. I think we're losing because Goliath has been spending too much in his hotel room banging six groupies at a time.

						   I've often thought that being an obnoxious Yankee fan is like being a Bush supporter. Both are disgusting occupations frowned upon by the Lord Almighty, who hates greed, selfishness, idiocy, and Jorge Posada. Let's look closely. The Yankees make more money than everyone else; so do Republicans. By fighting against a salary cap, the Yankees ensure that there remains an unlevel playing field so that no one can challenge their dominance; so do the Republicans. The Yankees plunder their own farm system annually in order to make trades to win the World Series, giving little thought to the state of the franchise in a few years. Bush raids our nation's treasury and environment for gain now rather than leaving something for the next generation. The Yankees win when they don't win; remember the little boy who gave Derek Jeter's fly ball to the warning track in the '96 ALCS a little boost into the stands? The little boy should have been forced to wash his hands of his crime with Yankee Stadium toilet water, but instead he was exalted as a hero. We all know how Bush wins when he doesn't really win; he, too, has not been forced to cleanse himself of his crime, and not because he can't find enough vestigial Clintonian discharge lying around the White House to do the job.  There are similarities between the people on both teams. Jason Giambi and Rush Limbaugh are practically identical twins, sharing equatorial waistlines and drug addictions. Paul O'Neill and Dick Cheney are alike in that they are both completely insane. They should both be put into lion cages at the zoo and see how long it takes for all the lions to be dead. Condoleeza Rice is a young Don Zimmer, in that neither of them has any clue what's going on. Joe Torre is like Colin Powell, a good man who's been caught working for a bad cause. But George Steinbrenner is definitely like George Bush, arrogant, condescending, without any foundation for his innate sense of superiority and entitlement. Neither cares that they are ruining things for everyone else.  Now, I understand that some support the Yanks because they were born in New York. It's OK to be a Yanks fan, as long as you're not a fan. Which is to say, don't be obnoxious. Your team is good because they spend 140 million dollars more than the average team, not because it is an absolutely superior franchise. It's like rooting for a twenty-year-old to beat a five-year-old in a fight. You know that in fifteen years, the kid could beat the twenty-year-old, but now he has no chance.  And I understand that some are born Republicans. Tha's OK, too; it can't be helped. But to support Bush, when he and his goons are undermining everything that is good about our country, is hardly justifiable.  With any luck, the Yankees will be playing in the World Series in November and will lose, causing all Bush supporters who root for the Yankees to stay home on election day because of their depression. It could happen, unless that little bastard cheats again.
