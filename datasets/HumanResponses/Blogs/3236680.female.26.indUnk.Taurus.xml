      Dear person.  Let me answer a number of issues you raised. This is just my reading of the situation, and I can be wrong.  First, the "lack of connection" and the "guardedness" of people around you. Yes, you have this uncanny way of rubbing people the wrong way. Your lack of "connection," or, let's say, personal confidence or security in your being makes you jump at the slightest sign of "connection" with another person. What is absolutely appalling is your tendency to "squat" in other people's lives. I don't know if you're famiiar with the squatting phenomenon in your country, but that is where people who don't own the land they live on stay there and claim it as their own, regardless of obvious facts. You, my friend, assume that once a person has become your friend, you have the right to intrude into their lives and assume that you have the right to refer to their friends (whom you have never met) and family (same thing) as if you knew them yourself, as if you have the same relationship with them as your new-found friend has. You presume that because now you are friends, you have to spend all your free time together. You have the right to ask what their plans are. Well, you don't. Deal with it.  Another thing is your tendency to stretch the truth. You do this all the time to the girl and me. You say things like: "J**** wants to go to.... or "someone" wants to do.....," or worse: "you said you wanted to.... (no, I didn't, asshole!)" passing it off as the desire of other people when in fact, it is only you who wanted that.  Balibad pa .  We hate it that you invade our privacy and our time. We are sorry that you feel you don't have friends you can hang out with, but we, especially me, are not about to tie a rock around our necks so you can feel good about yourself. I am not a self-esteem dispenser. I have a life that does not include you, and I prefer it that way. If you can't seem to find a life of your own, I'm sorry for you. But I am not about to allow you to use me as your sounding board everytime you feel insecure, because you drain people. Yes, you go and project your: "I'm so sad, pity me pity me" control drama, all the while draining the energy from unsuspecting, well meaning people. Well, I've caught on to your act. Do you know what you are called? Psychics call you an emotional vampire.  You are that way because you believe in nothing. You have nowhere to draw your energy from, not even yourself because you always think you're not good enough. You want to explore the realms of faith, but I doubt if you will find what you are looking for. Because ultimately, you seek other people to provide you with that energy. You don't believe in god, the angels, or whatever metaphysical beings. You don't believe that there can be something beyond this physical world, and although you toy with the idea in our discussions, I think you will never find faith. You think too much. Faith and belief defy the rational. It is a very personal experience, based on one's feelings and instincts. You have never felt safe enough to just listen to your soul, and to follow what it says regardless of what norms or conventions you will have to break. Yes, you say you have broken your religion's conventions. But you have never really taken a stand, have you? You are too afraid of the emotional investment that fighting for something would take, so you have taken the safe way out.... Be an agnostic, wash your hands of responsibility and say: "I don't really know." (at your age and with all the time you spend thinking?hmmm)  It has always been your choice. You make your bed, you lie in it. So stop disturbing me. When I say I am not doing anything don't assume that it means it's ok to spend time with you. I don't want to. Assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups and you, my friend, are very much that. Fucked up.

      I know by now that I seem to have inherited my mother's tendency to get depressed. I think it must be mainly hormonal, because it is right before, during and right after my period that my depression comes out. I know I am depressed, but that does not prevent me from feeling down in the dumps, as if everything is wrong.  Today, I have moved from being irritated, impatient, to unexplainably sad. I wish I knew why. I try so much to psychoanalyze myself, but it is difficult to play counselor and patient at the same time.  Let's see.... why am I sad?  I am angry at myself, because I can't seem to gather my thoughts together enough to write the two extra pages that The Buzz is asking from me. I know what should be written, but the words aren't coming. Deadline is on Wedensday and I don't want to cram again.  I am angry because I cut aikido class for this paper, and nothing came out of it.  I am going home in a few days, but it seems to good to be true and the pessimist in me is wondering if something would go wrong. I am hoping that nothing will, but it never hurts to be prepared.  I am also angry and frustrated because the Mactan connection is terrible, and all I can hear from The Hunny are disjointed words. Not that he is saying anything beyond mwah mwah mwah. I want to be angga today, but I think I need something a little more than that.  I guess at the end of the day, I am just hormonal. And this creature that keeps pestering me for attention! I will write next about him!!

      That old blog has been getting too.... crowded.  There are things which some people have no right to know about me... but which I also need to vent out once in a while. This blog is for that purpose....

      When these networking services ask you to describe yourself, what do you say? Where do you begin? Why do other people find it so easy to describe what they are?  I've been asked that again and again these past few days, and I always come up with a blank wall. Which aspect should I talk about? Should I give a "bio-data," i.e. birthday, birthplace, genealogy, academic background? Should I talk about my personality? Now that would be laugh. No one has figured me out, not even me. Should I talk about my life? Ewwww. I doubt if anyone wants to read my autobiography. I forgot Salman Rushdie's exact words in Midnight's Children, but went something like: "I am a product of my world." And my world is a product of other worlds.. and so on and so forth... all that Philosophy of the Human Person/Being/Historicity/Heidegger and Kierkegaard stuff that gave me a C+ for two semesters in undergrad.  I know what I am, but I would rather not limit myself to decriptions. I don't think anything can describe the way my mind works... how I know what the person is going to say as he opens his mouth, what he is thinking when he looks at me, what he actually means when he says one thing. I can't explain why I know that given something this person will do this. I can't give a good excuse when I'm in a bad mood, or when I just feel happy, sitting alone under a blue sky. I can't say I'm nice because most of the time I'm bitchy, even when people say otherwise. I don't want to say I'm smart because I'm not... I'm not a Tracy or a Zuba.  So I would rather not box myself into a description. I'm just me, and you be the judge.

      I read his blog today and at the beginning started feeling guilty pangs about why I have been so hideously bitchy (secretly and sometimes publicly) to him. After all, he didn't seem to be such a bad guy. I have also been toying with the idea that perhaps, some sort of past-life experience left me feeling this way, because there is no rational way to explain how every little thing he does becomes irritating for me. The strangest thing is that we started out good friends, and I actually liked him... until I changed my mind, that is. Why? Refer to  urlLink post below . At the end of said post I realized that he has has copied (for the nth time!!!!!) my writing style!!!!! Gad!  Ga init gid ulo ko !!!!! If you look at his past writings, they were senseless mumblings of a pseudo-philospher theorizing and complicating all the ideas of the world. Now he has gone and copied my pedestrian way of writing!!!!  Imitation should be the best form of flattery but... grumble grumble.....  The million dollar question is, however, why am I spending so much time,energy and mental space on a hapless creature (who ocassionally sucks out other people's energy)?  I can't explain it. The way he smells irritates me. The way he talks irritates me. And now, SHE is beginning to like him. Agh. I wash my hands of all of these.

      Well, the  urlLink fat lady  has sung, but my performance is far from over. I admire her for seeing herself that way, and I wish I could too, but a lot of things hold me back. I used to believe that I had nothing to prove anymore; I've graduated from good schools, achieved good things. But the other day caught me thinking of a now-common conversation between the Hunny and me.  i.e. Me:  Hey... I know that person.... Do I look ok?  (variant: "Am I pretty?" "Sexy?" Gad, I sound pathetic, and maybe I am). Hunny:  You look fine. Why are you so concerned about image, anyway?   It is difficult to admit but, yes, I am concerned about my image. Am I shallow and pathetic that way? I have a list of reasons why I act this way, but it will probably not be enough to justify my un-empowered, un-feminist behavior.  I feel I have to prove some things. One, that I am beautiful. Two, that I am smart and interesting. Three, that I am successful. Despite everything that has happened. I don't look it, but I am heavily scarred by that event which I should have put behind me, and which has given me so much to be happy about now. But I can't. The storm has passed, and people have moved on with their lives, but at times I still hear those accusations. I get impressions, rightly or not, that people are still looking at my every move, waiting for me to slip up so they can dissect me again and say: "See, she's nothing now."  I've made some enemies. I've broken conventions, I refused to follow unspoken rules, and I've upstaged many people. Obviously, they didn't like it. Even before it happened, I knew they were already stabbing me in the back. My fall became a free-for-all, and everything they could possibly pin on me they did, i.e. I was a satanist, I recruited members and led them in rituals disguised as org activities. I know the people who spread that story, but their names are not worth mentioning. I know the wheel turns. But it still hurt. People who should have known better believed them, people who have known me all my life. Oh well.  In the aftermath of that storm, I know many people were clucking their teeth, saying "I told you so." My gift made it harder, because I could tell that people looked at me differently because of my appearance: in their eyes I was no longer interesting, smart or worth any time of day. I was a has-been, washed out, fat, and likely to live a life of failure.  It made me want to go back, to finish what I started, to show them that despite everything, my dreams were not shattered, my future was still bright, I was still an achiever. It is my vengeance against a world that has never tolerated barrier- breakers like myself: to show them that I am successful, happy, and yes, beautiful. I know, beauty lies in the eye of the beholder and entails more than just the physical. But I guess you can say that I have embarked on a propaganda campaign. My Hunny put it aptly when he said last week that I used to look so innocent and harmless... and now I look like the director of a psy-op.  Have I sold out, given in to the pressure to conform to the world's concept of beauty? In a way I have, because it was too painful to be seen as ugly. And so I apologize to the women's movement for my treachery. I wish I could stop caring about what other people thought. But I have changed. I am no longer the same girl, although I would like to think I kept something of her in me, no matter how small or unseen. She will never come back, and although it saddens me that things can never be the same again, I realize I would have had to face the cruel world one way or another. And so I fret about my weight.

      We've never had a conventional relationship. In the first place, there was never any courtship in the traditional sense. A lot of flirting, yes. We were both insufferable flirts. It just came to a point that one day, one of us said, "You know... we don't act like friends anymore... I don't feel I'm just a friend anymore...." The other agreed, and that was it. And it was just the beginning of the death of Filipino courtship.  In our three years together, I have only received flowers twice; both times when The Hunny did some very thoughtless things (he knew he was in trouble!). He says that flowers symbolize... you know. But I suspect it's just his way weaseling out of such frivolous expenses. I don't really mind the lack of flowers, but sometimes I do mind the endless KKB. I've always wanted to be pampered, to have the guy say, "Don't worry, ako bahala," because that was the way I was brought up.  A few days ago I confronted the money issue (in my favorite thinking place: the banyo). True, it's such a hassle to be always paying my way. I often envy those girls whose boyfriends buy them everything, who pay for everything on dates and shower them with gifts day in and out. And I had to face the fact that yes, my Hunny is kuripot... But on the other hand, if he did the same things that other boyfriends are doing, what would our relationship be like? I realized that in most of these relationships where the guy answers for everything, boyfriends tend to be dominant and influence the decisions of their girlfriends. In a way, a lot of utang na loob gets accumulated in such a set up. So, yeah, I still maintain, financial dependence on a guy limits a girl's overall independence, and the way I was brought was not really the best way in the first place.  I guess I'll have to rely on my money (which is nil) for the rest of my life. The Hunny and I already agreed to split expenses when we live together, rather than go for the "fork over everything" Filipino way. I guess that would be better than being accused of being after his money. And I guess it also comes because, no matter how much we profess to love each other, we are always wary of the future. We don't trust each other enough to give everything, and he admitted that much to me some time ago. It hurts, but I guess the same goes for me. We are perennially afraid that the other might leave us, so we avoid making huge investments on each other. Well, he did, anyway. I've sent him huge amounts of money, and I might bite my siko for it someday, but I still think it was the right thing to do (although now I'm penniless. It was for the Bibi).  I guess I just feel sad. Unlike other girls, I don't get flowers, chocolates, or silly things "just because." I've never received a ring or any piece of jewelry. The most expensive thing I got from him is this Swiss Army watch, which he had when he was in highschool ("Christmas and birthday gift na"). Well, it's laden with sentimental value, if that's any consolation.  I feel bad thinking these things, because I know he loves me and,even though he doesn't express it materially, he does so many things that other people would find too complicated or difficult to carry out (i.e. make plane reservations, send books, buy lactacyd and Ivory, etc). I guess I should just stop waiting for THAT RING or any ring, for that matter. But you know, sometimes I just feel sad.

      One of my ..er... "concerns" have come to pass. Note exchange between  urlLink dahon and dark river      At 8:18 AM, dahon said...        >>The majority of the people who go out the streets to protest are usually people who have nothing else to do with their life so they pester other people and open their mouths with out thinking.        hey, hey, hey! get to know these people ralph.        >>that we lose our credibility as an ally      so this is about saving face than saving a life?        >>We have just shown the rest of the world that we can be forced to the will of terrorists      um no, disagree. the question is why are our troops there in the first place? we pull out because we don't think we should be there in the first place. it's not our war, the iraqi war wasn't a war against the terrorists, how deluded are we to think otherwise.:) it was bush's ego all along, but that's just my opinion.        >>What is one life compared to the lives of the rest of the Filipinos.      How do you quantify, if it's someone you love?    Ugh.    While he is a brilliant engineer, my Hunny Bunny tends to say things without thinking, say one thing when he means another, and be plain facist once in a while. I agree with his bottom line, but I would have gone about the attack differently.    And I guess, in some twisted way, I am apologizing for him, although it would hurt him to know that. He has a good heart, for a Machiavellian, but abstract thinking is not really his forte. He just says what he believes in, although he hasn't really thought out how to defend it.    Of course I feel pressured to explain ;)

      We hardly go out on dates. We don't give each other gifts "just because." I easily get impatient, and often wonder where this will lead, if it is worth hanging on to. I catch myself automatically replying "I love you too," my mind drifts when he talks of something uninteresting to me, and I mumble, "Yeah, ok," just to keep the conversation going.  The excitement is gone. We are the best of friends, but we hardly have those days anymore where we laugh and joke about each other, where we just sat and spent time together, unmindful of other things, not thinking of the next place we needed to rush off to, of the next errand we needed to do.  I guess at one point in time we had to grow up. Now he thinks of work, of paying the bills, of his bank account, gasoline, trucks and repairs. I think of a career, again, far away from him. With all the time we spent away from each other, we must have unconsciously gotten used to being by ourselves. I know I have. He doesn't say it, but his life doesn't seem to need me in it either. Either way, he'll live.  I asked him the other day if he would let me leave to study again. He said he wouldn't stop me, but he would miss me. What was unsaid was, if I stayed, what would our life be like together? Because the answer is: things would be pretty much the same. He goes on with his work, and I go off to entertain myself with other things.  I really shouldn't ask for more, ne? After all, other couples with regular nine to five jobs have it worse. Or do they?  I used to complain that we didn't spend enough time together. Now, I just wonder what we would do if we did have time together. Stay at his house and mope, probably.  This relationship just doesn't seem so exciting anymore. Everything has become so predictable, I find myself taking him for granted a lot of times. It's not fair, I know. I assume he will do things for me, be there for me, and he does, he is. But I also want more. I want our old conversations back, I want more time alone together, not with the entire extended family in tow. I want to be pampered, treated like a girlfriend and not as a guy bud. I want flowers too, and the poetry he used to make. I want stupid little gifts, stupid little visits, suprises.  But I guess working people don't have that luxury anymore. And I am guilty of feeling impatient in the few moments when he is mushy. I think, "Now, what has gotten into him? Does he want something? Is he guilty about something? Does he want sex? Is he just doing this because he knows I feel bad?"  In the past two years there have been drastic changes in me, and he was always just in the background, the loyal boyfriend waiting back home. And now that he's no longer there, I guess I'm not quite sure what to do with him, what to do with us. And it doesn't help that I am left alone everyday to deal with the ill-disciplined Pabii. It is so uncomfortable to be in his house, with the cold fish plastic parents and the bratty siblings. I guess I resent him for that too.  I don't like to admit it, but I am rethinking our relationship. I am neither here nor there, neither moving forward or backward, because I don't really know where we're going together. For him, it is just: "Let's do what we can now, save money, and we'll see in a few years." For me, it is: "Tell me now so I can pattern my decisions around it!" For him, it is Negros. For me, Negros will slowly kill whatever is left of my brain.  Worse, I don't think I am ready to be a mother. I was, two years ago, but I have been on my own since then, and I don't think the same way anymore. I make a terrible mother. I am impatient. I want my independence, I change my mind at the spur of the moment.  But I love him, and that makes everything harder. He has been my bestfriend, and he has done so much for me that I can't ignore. There are days that I feel frustrated, neglected, unwanted, and these are the days when he is away. But he comes home, looks extremely guilty, is extremely attentive and loving, and I can't remain angry at that, although I know the cycle will repeat itself. Although I know that this cycle must end, one way or another.  If you could choose, would you rather have a happy, fulfilled life loveless, or would you choose a pathetic life as long as you kept the man you loved? Love or the world? It's so simple, but so complicated.

      I knew what the consequences of my decision were, but now that I am reaping them, I am still having a hard time finding acceptance.  I knew that leaving would mean that the Pabii would forget me, she will be disciplined in a way that would be different from my concept of discipline, and she will be socialized in way that I will not have much control over.  Still, the Hunny and I tried to fight it. We would voice chat and use the webcam almost everyday. I would check up one her daily routine, her vocabularly (quite colorful), her attire. Thank goodness for technology.  To a certain extent, we were sucessful. She recognized me on sight, and didn't go through the "speechless turtle" adjustment period she usually goes through with strangers. The Hunny implemented all I asked for, from keeping the yaya, sticking to the family doctor, to dressing the Pabii better because my Mom said she looked like a "yagit."  But how far can my long distance influence go? I feel frustrated when she throws a tantrum when she doesn't get her way, and the only way of calming her down is for Yayay to pick her up. I feel so powerless when I know she needs to be disciplined, but I also have to be careful with what the Hunny's parents are going to say. She says things which she hears the maids and the driver speak, which are unacceptable (i.e. *name* baboy-- when she is angry).Despite these, I cannot get angry, I cannot discipline her the way I should. It is not my house. And in a way, I have no authority.  I knew these things would happen, but I still think I did the right thing. If I had left her with my father, where would she be now? At least with the Hunny, even though she's spoiled, she is secure. Everyone loves her, she has a home and will always have food to eat. Her father and grandparents will make sure her future is taken care of. I thought that was more important when I made my decision, but my family has never understood that. They still keep insisting that I take Pabii away. Away, where to?  I know my stay here is temporary. There is nothing here for me, unless I get a windfall of capital and start a business. And given the way things are, I don't think I was ever meant to be a mother. I am too transient. I move from one place to another, from one life to another. I must either be a career woman and focus on my work,  or a housewife focusing on my family. I don't think I can ever be in between.   I am lucky Ralph understands my need to move forward, but even then, I wonder how long that understanding will last.
