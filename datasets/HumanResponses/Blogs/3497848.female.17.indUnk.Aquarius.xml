      This relationship is the most useless I've ever been apart of. No matter how hard I try, or how well I  think  we're doing, there's always this point in our relationship that we have never been able to move past. We can't grow and I think that it's because, secretly, we hate one another. Yes, hate. And yet.... I find myself needing you. But not for any reason you would think. No, not for support or comfort or even for something to make me laugh, for this is surely no laughing matter. I need you to get on with my life. Ironic isn't it? The one aspect of my life I need most right now to excel in life is the very aspect that I must say goodbye to. You do not need me. So, it would only be fair to end this relationship as soon as possible, before one of us gets hurt.... namely  me . You will not read this for another week and 1 day. But by then, you will know this relationship has no future. So this is my letter to you, my not-so-dear....... Pre-Calculus.* Goodbye and  GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!    * To all math lovers:  Please take no offence. Math is obviously working out well for you and the two of you seem to love each other. Never let that go, because Math is the worst thing to have as an enemy. Believe me. *sniff*

      In the event that anyone besides myself sees this post, I'd just like to say... ... Hi ... ... My name is irrelevant and so is my age  (but I'm 17, if u wanted to know and I'm a girl too, eh?) . I live in Canada, but I'm from a land far away where Summer never ends and the bus system needs improving. As the name above implies, this BlogSpot will neither be here nor there. Meaning, it will not be dedicated to any one aspect of this maze people refer to as my mind. There will be ramblings, beginnings of songs left to die in the dust, finished poems, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Read at your own risk  (of dying of boredom) .

      Ladies and Gentlemen, I love my father, but sometimes he does things that really get my goat.... or they would if I had a goat. Anyway, he has to sleep in the living room while he's visiting and this is where the computer is. So he asks when I'm getting off because I have to remember that ppl have to sleep there. So I ask if my clicking and typing are bothering him. He says yes. Now, ladies and gentlemen, that seems reasonable enough. HOWEVER here's the thing:  The man is falling asleep on the couch in front of the TV which is ON!!!!!!!!  It's on now and he is snoring away. He's supposed to be the wiser one, right? *sigh*

         I am 13% evil.            I try to stay away from evil deeds but succumb to temptation every once in a while. I'm not quite on my way to hell but I certainly have some explaining to do.      Are you evil?  find out at  Hilowitz.com

      ...I'm a little annoyed. I'm on this South Beach diet (4 weeks now) and I feel like I'm trying to quit smoking. Why? Because I have a craving for FRIES or PIZZA (either one will do). But instead of buying it (due to lack of money) I'm chewing Juicy Fruit. Grrrrrrrr I really want fries or pizza. Help me!!   My dad and grandma are coming in (Dad from Toronto, Grandma from Jamaica) for my graduation and I have been given the duty (I shouldn't think of it that way but that's how it feels) of showing my grandma around Winnipeg since she'll be here for another WEEK after my graduation.   I'm a little annoyed about this whole situation, in fact, because I'm just being told what to do with my life. I've been told to go to York I'm being told that we're moving to a smaller apartment on July 1 staying there for a month and then moving to a bachelor's apartment for when it's just my mum here and I'll be there for 2 weeks before I move to Toronto where I get to take 3 buses to school and 3 from school every day. *sigh* Just talking about it annoys me.

      I am finished with Math and have passed with an overall grade of 65%. This is  the lowest mark  I have  ever  received in  any  subject. Nevertheless, I am simply glad I passed because all I needed was to pass with a grade of 60 or more. And that is a goal I have achieved and I am proud.  Next week I graduate from high school and that day will be oh so sweet.  I have been accepted to university in Toronto and have received an entrance scholarship that is, roughly, six sevenths of my tuition:  FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS . Ladies and gentlemen, this has made my life SO much easier.   I recently got contact lenses. (yay!) I've wanted contacts since I was 7. It's been 10 years, but finally I have them. Oh happy day! Now to get rid of this "glasses tan" I've developed over the course of my LIFE. ^_^

      ....come in all shapes and sizes. You have the slim, pretty ones and the tall not so pretty ones. And please do not assume I only mean girls. On the contrary, guys bug me too. _^ So here are the people who bother me most. First, you have the people who can  NOT  be corrected. The even worse variation of this type of person is the person who  LOVES  to correct others. And isn't even tactful about it. This kind of person has no quams about simply saying, "Dude! That's so wrong!" And even worse still is a variation if THIS person, who, when they realize that it was in fact THEY who were wrong, can't even say, "Oh. My bad." Or even acknowledge that they were wrong. But if you simply point out something, tactfully and sensitively, mind you, they get pissy and claim you're just trying to make them look bad.   All of that was only ONE person. Seriously. The next type of person is really not good to have around (or be). This is the type of person who invites themselves to places. Even after being told, "I don't want you there." That sounds clear enough does it not?! YES! IT DOES! BECAUSE IT IS!! In  fact  that's just plain harassment when you follow someone somewhere under the pretence that you're going to go somewhere else, but cross the street instead of going straight. Now, I don't know what your parents taught you, buddy, but this kind of behaviour is seriously frowned upon. I mean, what idiot invites themselves somewhere after having been told they are NOT welcome and then tries to win you over by buying you a smoothie? As if that makes up for it! Child! When you turn 18, if you do this to someone else (more importantly if I ever see you and you do this to  ME ), you can be arrested for harassment. BE ADVISED  Another type of person is the type who, in the beginning seems really nice and is, in fact, a little naive. Then, as time goes by, this person develops a whole new personality. And I really mean WHOLE NEW. It gets to the point where this person denies ever having been the way they were before. Even worse, they become egotistical and think everyone is on their side.   Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever find yourself around one of these people, RUN. Get away from them as fast as possible, because these are not good people to be around. And if you ever find yourself doing any of these things, or being like any of these people, go home and re-evaluate yourself. Pay more attention to people's reactions to the things you say like, "Where you goin'? Ok, I'm coming with you." If you and the person haven't already established a relationship where you can do that kind of thing, don't do that kind of thing. Paying attention is key. Do this, and it will go well with you.

      Today at 12 was the Grad Picnic for -you guessed it- all the graduating students. It was fun. There were mountains of hot dogs and I had only one since I was on this diet I was on and couldn't have too much bread. " So just eat the meat then " you say, but I wanted a hot dog, not a sausage. So I had one hot dog then I didn't have the croutons in my salad. It was a good tasty chicken salad so I didn't feel deprived. THEN there was wetness. Yes, everyone was soaknnig each other. A couple friends even got booted. Meaning: some guy had found a rain boot (galosh whathever you call it. it was green and plastic) and used that to pour water on ppl, which is disgusting cuz then those ppl had foot-water all over them. Plus he just found it somewhere. You don't even know where it had been. Eeeeww nasty. Anyway, I was the only one who didn't get wet. My friend and I had our very expensive SLR cameras with us and dared anyone to wet us up who was willing to pay for the damages. No one did. Except my friend went into the washroom to help another friend change and some guy threw a water balloon over the door not caring who was inside and her camera got wet. =( But I think it's fine cuz it still took pictures after that. Good times.

      I got new clothes....well, I bought new clothes. This is something I'm pretty happy about, since I was in dire need of them. Yay for new clothes. And... yesterday I did my practice exam for Pre-Calculus and you know what? It wasn't that bad. I feel like it's trying to lull me into a false sense of security then  BAM!  the exam will be  SUPER HARD  and I'll run out of the exam crying. Oy, I hope not. You know what, I refuse to let myself think that. I will pass and I will rock. There. End of discussion.

      In exactly 1 month, I move to Toronto. Should I be excited? I think so, but I'm not...why? Well, because I still haven't registered for my courses THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN, thank you very much, and I still haven't done much with my friends, and I kinda feel like most of them aren't too bothered. That's a terrible thing to feel isn't it? Cuz it can't be true. Well, I hope it's not true, but I've been so bored and I just keep thinking how much less time I have with them as the days go by. Hmmm oh well, when I move, I move I guess.

      No. I really don't. About 15 minutes ago (3:30AM), my mother and I, along with the inhabitants of 24 other floors of apartments were rudely awoken by the sound of the.....what?  *contestant* What is the fire alarm, Alex?  THAT'S RIGHT!!!! The  FIRE ALARM !!!!!!  JOHNNY tell them what they've WON!!  *announcer guy* Well, I suppose they've won  the fire !  And on the eve of our moving OUT!! Now isn't that the MOST LOVELY parting gift anyone's ever given? This just tells us that the building thinks about us and doesn't want us to leave. Ladies and gentlemen, I will not lie to you, I was SO scared. Just the thought that I might die tonight freaked me out! And it shouldn't! I should be ready to go whenever my Lord decides I should go. *sigh* I'm tired now, I'm going back to bed, so I can wake up and MOVE HOUSE!!!

      to a friend's cottage on Wednesday and got back today. The cottage was fun. The mosquitos were not. Mosquitos are evil and they carry diseases and I don't know what purpose they actually  serve .

      This is going to sound a little weird but I have to rant so I think I'm going to. I went with my mother to go bra shopping (yeah I know weird topic). ANYWAY I wanted to cry (and I did in one of the dressing rooms). We went to four stores...the only 4 that sold underwear in that mall and could find 1 decent one my size. ONE!! And it's not even just right or anything cuz it has patterns on it that  SHOW UP  through your shirt. I mean,  WHO WEARS THAT STUFF ?! It doesn't  LOOK GOOD!  But we bought it anyway, because, let's face it, I needed it. I was so depressed I went to the bookstore and was going to splurge by buying 3 books. Some splurge, right? 3 books! But books are so friggin' expensive no wonder kids don't read anymore! ANYWAY, I was starting to feel better (cuz books make me feel better), but then my mother is like, "Only buy one. That way you can buy another bra some other time and something nice too." But the books WERE the 'something nice' I wanted!! And I said that too, but she said, "I know sweetheart but I meant clothes-nice things." So I was in an even  WORSE  mood because I only got 1 of what I needed cuz that was all that was half-decent and I only got 1 of what I  WANTED  because my mother said so. Then we ate and went home. And on our way home I saw some cool stuff on the sidewalk so when I got home I got my camera and went back (it was just the street next to ours) and took pictures of the cool things. So I felt a little better about that. But I'm still depressed!!!
