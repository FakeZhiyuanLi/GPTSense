      Scenes from my recent trip to Seremban!  urlLink    urlLink    From young, I never had a real family home, a real family dinner and all, my parents' job required them to be always on the move...so I could only see them during school holidays. In occasions like this when I get to visit them, it will always stay in my heart, to know what family togetherness feels like.  My dad whipped up his specialty----stewed pork leg with vege, very good...very hokkien! hehehe. We had fun the whole night, family-get-together, sang karaoke after makan, what a  splendid  night!

       Last wednesday was our first time karaoke session @ Orchard cineplex    Kbox .    We had a great time ! The three singing birds really can sang well. I should say we are all extraordinarily well qualified to get in the     Singapore's idol    hahahha   ...      Its was a ladies night and was just $15 per pax form 7pm till closed which including 2 drinks and tibits. During that night Liwen & I dedicated a song 'Zhu fu' by Jacky Chueng to our dear friend    Kristie    who is going to circus next month.We got sentimental and tears started to rolled down our cheeks while singing to her. We just can't bear to see her go ...it was a magic moment that i believe everyone of us will not forget.Although me and liwen do feel sad about her leaving but we both know it's for her bright future .No matter what we will still give her all our support!!    Kristie you can do it and all the best to YOU!!!             Till late 11:00 pm we still not willing to leave the place..trying to finish all the songs that we choose..we sing, dance and even video down some of the funny shot into my mobile phone..We fell about whenever we play the video clip again and again.Hahaha it was so funny .  .. I guess we are the most happening room in the kbox . ..and we plan to go agian next WEDNESDAY !!! YEah ...will update for the next round ..... ;)

      Last Wednesday was awesome!Went to dbl O with my dear friend liwen &amp; Kristie .It's been so long that the three gals went party together. Althought it was just a short party but there was really so much fun with them!! And most important is it's the night for ladies and man cant get it!Haha...  We had all sort of poison.Long Island Tea,Tequila neat and smooth shooter...and that's nearly killed us.  Initailly the planning of the party supposed to be end by 12am as Liwen got to work on the next morning.With the raise of party mood she decided to extend another 30mins. And the 30 mins really let her enjoyed alot!!We were laughing and enjoying dancing all night..  Along the party we managed to 'hook' some cute guys. But too bad the three Cinderella got to roll out of the club into a taxi by 1230am.  It's been so long that we have so much fun before.I am sure there will be a next one coming up soon...

       urlLink    " I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life ... but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."  Have you ever dreamed of true love? Well, here's your chance to read about it. The Notebook is about a first love that lasts a lifetime.   Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson meet one summer and fall in love. Noah has just graduated from high school, while Allie is a junior. They face many differences, but the one that has the greatest effect is her parents' disapproval. At the end of the summer she leaves town with her parents, and Noah feels his heart will break in two. Despite efforts to keep in touch, his letters go unread.  He spends the next 15 years living with the "ghost" of Allie. Then, out of the blue, on a cold autumn day, Allie returns, only to tell Noah she is engaged. Her engagement, however, doesn't stop them from falling in love again. They spend the next few days together, exploring the wilderness and, eventually, their hearts. Everything is perfect until Allie's fiance shows up. For the second time, Allie leaves Noah without making any promises. &nbsp; urlLink

       Today was all alone in the office .Most of the people already planning for their long weekend and yet I was in the office working till 6pm . Still got to tolerate 4 days more to go before my OFF day.*sighed* .What to do ? There is no 5 day week / 5.5 day week off day on weekend/PH in my club...      My pig sista still in Hong Kong, will only be back in 4 days time .Miss her so much.She's like a breath of fresh air when she was in the office.I guess I also need a break. Just want to get out from Singapore to have some fresh air.life is so stressful here.Planning to go KL for some shopping spree & makan with friends in Sep.I really miss the hokkien mee there .Cant wait to have it now! It's just so yummy!      Two day ago went to watch the movie "Village" with my Pig brother. I thought it's those scary movie that will make me scream, yell and hide under my Tee. But it was just unexpected.Story was really well written .More like a love story to me! Wondering will i do such things for a guy.Cant imagine myself running in the wood alone ..Love is the strangest things in the world . It can kill a person But also can bring ones with happiness ... But no matter it apply to who i will always ask myself " Is he worth it ?"   There's always going to be people that hurt you so what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who you trust next time around.No one is worth your tears, and the one who is, won't make you cry...       Finally my papers is over, but i didnt really did well.. just pray hard and hope to get a PASS...

      It's been a hard day night. Was resting at home when my brother called and asked me to buy something urgent for him.... I’m dead tired and almost want to faint on my bed.Argghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...trying really hard to drag myself out from my house to causeway point. What to do? He's my brother and I can’t reject him. Happen to drop by Fiesta at causeway, bought the original favour cheesecake for breakfast. Wow it’s smell good!! Feel like taking a small bite now...keke.  Feel great at home now.My eyes hardly open now ...guess I am getting old...no more stamina to stay late at night...  Better tuck in early and got to wake up early to catch my 168 bus .....
