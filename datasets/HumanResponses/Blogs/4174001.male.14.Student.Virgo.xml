Woke up on 1130 by brother to bring me to the moscow circus.... not to watch show but to work... i got changed and took 1 and a half hour to reach there which is at boon lay MRT station... We got there and walk into a room where there is everyone in black... so am i... i wrote down my name the the gave me the pay before i even started to work! I then preocedded to get instructiong from the IC and he stationed me beside the stage whos job is the easiest... Stand there and not let people walk accross the stage...and sit down when the show starts. Catch people using video cams and children sitting on railings.... The first show was intersting but the second show made me fall asleep...  HAHAHA imagine looking and the same show twice and they repeat every move which the crowd think that it was an accident... after the show ends i went home by mrt....      When i reached KangKar LRT station, i walked to rivervale plaza's NTUC to buy Honey Stars to eat.... I immediately on my computer when i reached home and people started calling me to play mu... i Started happily playing mu while i heard Yong Hong tell me he created a blog and told me to visit it and add a tag...i think his was good...but his music was abit too sad... After that i heard kenneth bully jacq and made her cry... i make sure he pay for it... and heard he INSULTED GUTSFORCE!!! IT WAS MY GROUP AND HE DARE INSULT IT.... So i told jacq to send me that kenneth said but i cant read XML docs!!! so she have to send me another day...now it is 0330 am and this blog is create within 10 mins so dun mind it looks like shit....
