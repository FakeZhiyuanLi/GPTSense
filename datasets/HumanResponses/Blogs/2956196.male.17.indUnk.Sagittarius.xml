      Wo, 10 days since i last 'blogged' (still hate saying that). And what has happened in those days? I can't remember to be honest. The usual undulations between euphoria and depression. Finding out my blood group is B+ (same as Fraz). And oh yeah, FUCKING CHEMISTRY. That subject will be the death of me. I actually worked solidly for 3 nights after school on the write up. Fair enough i did have 2 weeks to do it but i procrastinated. That's not a crime is it. Either way i don't even need any grades as i have ALL unconditionals. Ha the easy life. But there's no way i'm fucking up my exams because of that. Mind you prelims were crap, BBC. Not only rubbish but soo corporate. BUt at least it's the holidays now and i'm flying to canada in 12 hours. 10 days snowboarding fun for me then. Despite factor of 10 days with father. Ah, was partying last night to mark end of term. It was actually quite interesting to see how me and don managed to keep talking for about 2 and a half hours in Nicky Tams. Then Phil showed up and we chatted some more and signed his shirt. Don signed it "I wrote this while u were taking a piss" as, strangely enough Phil was.Quite amusing. In fact I had a weird variety of drinks. Beer, Cider, Vodka and Bailey's. And i have now discovered the joy of Bailey's again. BUT...bitch at Spencer's didn't serve me. For fuck sake that's never happened before and it's so annoying. And i was also really annoyed about how lame i am. But in a vain effort to cheer the feck up, i watched "Withnail & I" then right after, the classic "Romeo and Juliet". However, i must have overlooked the fact that it is a tragedy and they kill each other in the end, as by the time it had finished i was quivering in my chair with emotional pain. Especially the very last lines: "for never was there a story of more woe, than this of juliet and her romeo". Aghh the pain. But luckily "Withnail & I" had humour. "I demand to have some booze". "there must and shall be aspirin. if i do not have aspirin I, i shall die". "accident black spot!? They're throwing themselves into the road to escape all this hideousness". "i fuck arses? who fucks arses?". They may not appear funny but when Richard E Grant says them, it's funny. Anyway i'm gonna indulge in some serious apathy before finally doing something resembling packing. Later

      I have come to the conclusion that no one I know or want to know reads this crap, but I'm still gonna do it as it is one of the only outlets I have for saying the stuff in my head. Well not  all  the stuff in my head as I would give away too much. I have some new found friends for that now who I feel I can trust. At least I hope I can trust them. Nothing other than that tonight kiddies. Oh Sex and the City finished tonight. Shame. I liked it a lot. Feck this I'm off to sleep, perchance to dream. Is that Shakespeare? I think it is.  Bye

      Haven't done this for ages as nothing interesting has happened. Well that's a lie actually. Things started to get 'brighter' since Wednesday for reasons I'm not gonna indulge to many people(esp. NOT sandy). But I dunno, I'm confused with life at the moment. I've got a sort of cold which is annoying and a bloody chemistry project to write up in 2 weeks(!!) and a busy week ahead and I can't be fecked with it all. But back to a more enjoyable tale of drunken ceilidh dancing. It started off slightly shit (reasons I'm not..blah..blah plus sobriety) but then after a few beers things picked up when I danced strip the willow. I say dance, it felt like I was a seal being thrown about by a killer whale before being eaten. That dance was just a blur. And then, after singing along to 'Sweet Caroline' (neil diamond is cool) and Sweet Home Alabama and then more dancing, I find myself in a flat full of drunken people and almost lost my fingers attempting to open a bottle of wine with a bread knife. And then came the sobering with sleeping after a couple of hours later. What fun. Oh well, think that's about it for now as I'm tired. BYE

      YEAH! Snowboarding today at The Lecht! SOOOOOOOO GOOD!!! started off a bit pish but after beans and chips at lunch went back out and started annihilating the softish snow. will probably be in pain tomorrow as haven't been for ages. Was also quite nice actually driving there as i had Norah Jones on my iPOD. i think that i'm falling in love with her voice. especially with songs like 'seven years' and 'feelin the same way'. Lovely stuff all-in-all. Right now that's done time for the interesting stuff. Today, J.K Rowling and astronomy. Here goes. There is a star called 'Sirius' and is also known as 'Canicula', 'Alpha Canis Majoris', 'HD 48915' or simply 'The Dog Star', as it is the luminary in the constellation Canus Major. Those who have read and actually remember PoA or after will already see the connection. If you haven't read any HPs(why the hell not??) or are just thick as shit i'll explain the very little there is to explain. Sirius' animagus form is 'Padfoot', a  HUGE DOG . OOOOOOO I hear the masses go, that's fascinating. And it doesn't stop there. Sirius is the brightest star in the sky(as we see it) after the sun (with an apparent magnitude of about -1.46 for those who care) which contradicts the HP character's surname, 'Black'. That's pretty shit actually as it doesn't even mean or have any great depth of interest. Also, most Sirius' relatives are named after stars in constellations,his brother Regulus being the name of brightest star in Leo constellation plus cousins similarly etc etc. Indeed  I know that there's greater deal to the whole Black family background involving 'niger', the latin for black but that's really complex.  Well that was an interesting Harry Potter detail. At least i found it interesting yeah. I could continue onto Remus Lupin and the extra little wolf thing rather than the book's  slightly  shortened version but  that's pretty much it for now. Watching Cruel Intentions at the moment and wishing I had the charm of Ryan Philippe's character. And his car. Oh well, Bye For Now

      .....and he emerged from the dark clouds and saw the light! -- Vegan 2:67  Life isn't that bad. After yesterday's slightly shit day, this day is soo much better. Finally after being sold out everywhere for several months, i managed to get norah jones' first album and it (along with natalie merchant's tigerlilly) is one of the most beautiful albums ever. She has the softest voice ever. Anyway i've had a shit load of caffeine today and feeling a bit worse of from it. And i have decided, after much deliberation, to go to the sandy bday/rory fundraiser ceilidh next week. I am actually looking forward to it now. Final Fantasy X-2 is awesome still except i got a bit pissed when yojimbo poisoned me then use zanmato and then everyone died as i tried desperately to use a mega potion. But that was cool coz i just went to djose temple and am about to kick the lightning horsie's skull in! Paine is still the coolest though. And also on that FF note, i found the coolest wallpaper last night of the turks from 7. Soo cool. With my new +ve outlook, i can't wait to continue my chemistry project as it is soooo interesting and easy plus i only have one more reaction to carry out. Although there is some hefty maths to come i supposedly let another computer program do all the work and then i get full marks! Well maybe not  that  easy but still not too bad. It also goes into uni chemistry kinetics which is why it's so good. Oh just remembered that i should start to read the amber spyglass again as i haven't read it in ages. OK can't think of anything else but i'll just add that i have my feelings sorted regarding something which I've been confused about for a while. Very much sorted in fact. Ciao bambinos

      School sucks! Badminton sucks! Life sucks! Indeed I am down. about what? I don't know! I was happy at lunch as my chemistry project is working and it's gonna rock the cock.But then i got pissed off at something and there's been a downward spiral into despair. AND badminon didn't help. Usually slapping a cock about on a friday afternoon relieves some of the pent up aggresion and anger however today i just wanted to kill someone. Favourably Linda Barker(arrghh). Yep still despise her, and everyone else does too. Is it possible for a public execution to be introduced if there's an overwhelmingly large percentage of the UK population backing the motion?

      Don't have a clue how the hell this things is gonna turn out as i'm seemingly already lost but who cares, here it goes. OK. My imagination is very overactive imagination(by-product of being an onlychild i reckon) so i think about a LOT of stuff. If u ever see me staring into space for long periods of time apparently vegetating, i'm actually sorting out all my thoughts. Just like cats do as they have v.sensitive senses and get a LOT of info. Since this is my first blog(or whatever) i've opted for a simple division of things (people, places, food etc) i like and dislike as this forms the basis for many of my opinions(naturally) as well as decisions(ooo..naturally too).

      More fucking photos? Far too many photos. I don't mind scanning ones of people who do not have many pictures in the yearbook already but the fucking people who are in every photo? Cannot be bothered so shove it up your arse!  And Orange? The future is not bright, nor is it orange. It is black. And dismal. Lacking joy, colour, hope or any other form of positivity.     Pass the coffee.

      Nyaha Fucker. You can steal my modem but you cannot steal the main computer, can you!!!   This is very late for a Sunday but people keep giving me photos too scan, and because I am a lazy procrastinating bitch I had not done any, ergo (mmm) was forced to scan some at 11pm. Ugh! The pressures of being Editor of Photography.  But i'm finished now so......off to bed. And let's hope for more nice dreams.   (have now worked out that not eating and drinking coffee is a very bad mix. Just a warning children)

      Bloody hell The Two Towers is long!!! But it is very good so was worth it. And to top of the LOTR experience, played ROTK for a good couple of hours until i got bored of killing orcs. and the fucking mumakai scum.   Still it is fun being Legolas for a while. And he's 7000 years old apparently? Indeed a very hot 7000 year old elf.  I digress. My favourite listening at the moment: The Commitments soundtrack. Irish soul, what more could you want!? And Decko is an outstanding singer. Is a nice mix of upbeat and slow romantic songs too.  Now....I need a saga. what's the saga. it's songs for the deaf!! you can't even hear it!! Sorry too much Queens of the Stone Age recently. But it's amazing stuff. BUY IT!!!  For some reason I am contemplating doing a few hours revision tomorrow!?!? Hmmm. Chemistry. Unit 2. It calls for me!

      Oh my god. Have just read an article about what foods to eat at what times for your general well-being.  And....according to research, having a coffee at lunch will boost your concentration and problem-solving abilities!!!! As if it couldn't get any better, the absorption of caffeine is increased by fat.......so  you are meant to eat either 2 cookies or a doughnut with the coffee!!!! Lol. This is the best news ever!  Now this what i call good research. Research that promotes coffee and doughnuts! OK will now get coffee and doughnuts, consistantly, every lunch for the rest of my life. Yes even when i am a consultant anaesthetist.

      ...................and relax.   Ahhh, no more chemistry. Will spend a weekend doing absolutely nothing then begin to work for nabs and well i spose the exams.   I am therefore in a good mood. Which would be a change.   Oh dear. Need caffeine. Too hot in my room. Ate too much. But Derren Brown is on in 20 minutes.   Ha, will and grace is so good. Haven't watched it for a while but will start again.   Wow Derren Brown is good. Also has a nice voice.  Right, will get very little sleep tonight because of excessive coffee intake then sleep tomorrow alllll dayyyy.

      ...."the tallest tree, the sweetest sap, blowing my ass right off the map.....oooo it's quite nice out here, think i might just stay a while".   I love walking home in the sun listening to the chilis. Ah what a lovely day. Bout time too with all the shit weather recently.  Only have the discussion to do in chemistry for tomorrow. Ugh! percentage errors, what a bore. Still, out of my hair tomorrow.  So, plan for the rest of the night. -finish chemistry -eat doritos and dip -continue to wear hawaiin shirt  -be pissed off that i don't have sky and hence have to wait till next week to see E.R.  -still remain pissed that i missed bad girls last night (!!!!) -go to bed early to be ready for 8.30 driving lesson in morning  What a plan!

      I am sooooo fucking bored. With life and school mainly.   Plan never gonna work. Will just die poor and lonely (maybe not poor). Really not in the mood for this.   Chemistry is hanging around like a bad smell but shall go on friday. Then there's the nabs within the next few weeks. And then....the exams. God! Give us young people a break!   Me and Fraz have a good plan for after though. By those cinema passes that are £10 a month. Go to cinema everyday. See a ridiculous amount of films and save an even more ridiculous amount of money.   Ugh! FED. UP. Wanna go to Uni and cut up bodies and drink alcohol. And coffee too. Really want to drink coffee in a cafe wearing a white coat. With blood stains on it. Maybe that's not allowed. It also appears everyone is going to Aberdeen for Medicine.   When i say everyone i mean like 4 people. But still better than none. Or is it? I dunno.

      OK, the plan is really not gonna happen.              Meh  I love free periods. And what better way to spend my free time than sitting in music duty with don, jonny and rik. Well i spose work would be better but i don't need any grades. So why fucking bother.  "A Prayer for Owen Meaney" is really, really good! Was a bit slow at start but is now getting very engrossing. I dunno what to read after it though. I could start LOTR but i think i'll read them all in the summer. Maybe some of H.G Wells' short stories i have lying under my bed. Or perhaps some Garcia Marquez. Never did finish "100 Hundred Years of Solitude" so probably that.   For some reason I really want to dye my hair bright red. Dunno why. Maybe influenced by Jonathan Ross' wife. And Matt Bellamy. Might just do so in the summer before uni. Don't think Aberdeen would be pleased with me turning up to become a doctor with red hair though. Hmmmm, before Amsterdam?  Oh, informal photo tomorrow. Hawaiin theme? WTF!? Really, why did no one like my gender swapping idea apart from donald. How dare he claim people would think it was an outlet for something! Well it's better than hawaii isn't it. No sandy, vegetables was a shit idea.  Right. Time to read some "Meaney". And let's hope for no more incest.

      Oh dear. My planned day of work has failed. Did no chemistry and minimal biology. But did do outstanding psychology essay.  Doesn't sound as good as fraz's though. Apparently his has tails of the 'North American Fishing Snake'. Sounds like one snake i don't wanna meet. Then there aren't really many i do.  Fuck! Coffee is so good! Only problem is, after four or five mugs i begin to feel sick. Same applies for fudgy wudgies. Except only need two of them and i'm feeling grim.   Should really stop eating and drinking crap. I probably will die of cancer at 25 thanks to the excessive volumes of diet coke i drink. But i do not care anymore. It tastes nice. Very nice. So therefore shall drink it and remain ignorant. And all the criticising fuckers shall die from some undiscovered health disease. Nature does tend towards chaos anyway. So therefore consuming man-made things will decrease our entropy. Perhaps. Or not at all. We all die some day. It's inevitable.  Right, too dark  Should say that my plan for the future was not direct advice from emma, merely something i developed from points that arose during the conversation.   I am gonna have to alter my top 5 attractive women now too. Simple change. Swap Claire Danes for Kirsten Dunst. Easy. Done. The reasons are too obvious to waste time explaining so shall not bother.  God i hate shaving. When i am older (i.e richer) i think i might just get laser hair removal on my face so i don't need to abuse my poor skin several times a week. That, or i could refuse to shave and scare my patients with a huge bushy beard.  6th form photo tomorrow so will need my beauty sleep. ok, am gonna need a lot more than one day.

      WOW! what an abso-fucking-lutely brilliant day out!  The shopping was very good as i added 3 DVDs to my collection. So now have the first two LOTR films in collection, plus Drop Dead Gorgeous. The latter fits in perfectly with my other titles. But still no bloody clueless. Well i could have got it for £16 but considering i got 2 films for that price, i didn't bother. Will find it someday cheap and then have complete collection. Oh maybe after that and moulin rouge. Now....what else would go well????  And now for the main reason it was such a good day out: 50 First Dates.  Undoubtedly the most fucking hilarious movie i have seen in the cinema for a good year or two. Seriously. I laughed  so     hard it was painful. Oh god. I'm still laughing at the thought of it. Why was it so funny? Sean Astin's character!!! Honestly just........oh you  HAVE      to see it. In fact it was only me and fraz laughing at the same bits, the rest of the cinema remained quiet for most of it. Guess it was just our kinda humour. And as if the humour wasn't enough, there was a really sweet love story between drew barrymore and adam sandler. Awww, he made her fall in love with him everyday. Awww. Rather weird ending though.  And i spose this would link on nicely to a very deep conversation i had on MSN with emma. Was really good. Gave me some hope for the future. Sooooo...now all i have to do is get over unrequited love and wait to meet the right person. Hmmmm. Still gonna be a long time till until i feel loved. Oh well. I can wait for love. Just. Why? Because.......all you need is love!   Is this depressing?        Or just sad?   (sorry if this has sandra-ish style sarah. i think it does but can't be bothered to change it)

      Well like i said yesterday, it's the love songs today. And it actually is. But since i am still lazy, i can only be bothered to post one.  Oh but trust me it's  good   . here you go.  "All you need  is love.  A girl has got to eat.  All you need is love.  She'll end up on the street.  All you need is looove.  Love is just a game.  I was made for loving you baby, you were made for loving me.   The only way of loving me baby, is to pay a lovely fee.  Just one night....just one night.  There's no way coz you can't pay.  In the name of love. One night in the name of love.  You crazy fool. I won't give in to you.  Don't....leave me this way. I can't survive without your sweet love. Oh baby, don't leave me this way.  You think that people would have had enough of silly love songs.  I look around me and i see that isn't so, oh no.  Some people wanna fill their world with silly love songs.  Well what's wrong with that, i'd like to know, coz here i go....yeaaah. Love lifts up where we belong. Where eagles fly, on a mountain high.  Love makes act like we are fools. Throw our lives away, for one happy day.  We could be heroes, just for one day.  You. You will be mean.  No i won't.  And i. I'll drink all the time.  We should be lovers.   We can't do that.  We should be looovers. And that's a fact.  Oh nothing, will keep us together.  We could still turn, just for one day.  We could be heroes, for ever and ever. We could be heroes, for ever and ever. We could be heroes.....  ....Just because iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii will always love you.  How wonderful life is....now your in love."  Well there it is. there are possibly some errors. but still.....the love is there. aww well that was fun. took ages too.   Hmm. forgot to mention the geriatric love in eastenders last night. was very,very disturbing. but no where near as bad as the vile nudists on distraction that i'm watching at the moment. just wrong.   will be having fun in edinburgh tomorrow with fraz. should really be a three musketeers outing but is not. thanks to the loser musketeer. but then he did come first in the musketeer challenge. bastard.

      Why does no one watch Bad Girls!? I mean really, c'mon people. this is classic TV. it has ridiculous storylines (usually involving lesbians and/or illegal immigrant prostitutes), a sexist-pig prison guard (now being tormented in his dreams for killing an inmate. what goes around, comes around fuckwit!!) and finally, is full of hard-ass, powerful minded women (feminism people??).  Exactly!! . So. Now, armed with this knowledge, you shall tune in next wednesday at 9.00pm. oh btw,anyone outside of britain. don't waste your time trying. you have shite TV and can only dream of getting something as good as this. (yes, ok. E.R, friends sex and the city etc etc. thank you).   on a completely different note. LOVE SONGS!!! woo.......oh cannot be fucked to post them. sorry.  well fuck off. i have a biotech essay to do. will post them tomorrow. It's friday tomorrow so will have lots of time.  Completely forgot that there is no badminton in summer term. NOOO!! now have absolutely bugger all form of physical activity. shall have to find new friday activity. Hmmmmm.....meh

      Yelp! Have done no biology! Possiblity of test tomorrow! On top of a NAB, I KNOW! Oh well, life is the bitch and we are the dogs. Why is it that school holidays go past  so        quickly. Hmmm. annoying  I don't actually have anything against school itself, i mean i enjoy the people and learning is good (and how can i possibly forget music duty!!! Remember kids, 5th period Wednesday 21st April is the official "crew" photo. be there or be a fucking twat). It's just that i have to get up early to get the bus (which is  always     freezing), and then i could do without assembly. and regi. and 1st period. and 2nd period. 3rd is ok though. but it's never gonna change while i'm still in school so why complain.   Finally replied to ucas today. So am now definitely going to be heading north to Aberdeen. as long i haven't fucked it up and accepted biochemistry at edinburgh by mistake. nah, can't of. not that stupid. now just have to decide where to live there. halls obviously, but which ones??? probably crombie-johnston.  Am now gonna try and get to sleep. sounds easy but is really not. will have to read a lot of owen meaney to knock me out. plus a mild sedative may become involved at a later stage.   Apologies again for the song lyrics. shall post some luverly love lyrics (double alliteration!!!!!) soon. perhaps the whole of elephant love songs. i love that song. (should that be songs. i dunno. still good regardless)  (thank you random person for the comment. do i know you. please say if i do. but still thank you. more comments. more comments. more comments)

      I have received criticism from a certain person that my blogs sound, and i shall quote her, "Sandra-ish". !!!!!!!!! How dare she! Ok then, i shall change my style. How? By swearing profusely and being blunt and vulgar.Now see how you like it. And NO! I am not bitter at all. Let's go.  I fucking hate the school holidays. They're so piss boring. I'd rather drown myself in shit than endure another day of fucking about doing sweet Fanny Adams. And TV is shiiiite (!!!) during the day. Honestly, who gives a flying fuck about DIY and Antiques. And  FUCK OFF      "Murder She Wrote" and "Quincy".  So are you enjoying this Sarah. I know. Some fun song lyrics perhaps.  "I swatted her like no S.W.A.T team can, turned her cherry pie right into jam"    RHCP - Sir Psycho Sexy  "When masturbation's lost it's fun you're fucking lonely"   Green Day - Longview  "Fuck You I Won't Do What You Tell Me"  Rage Against The Machine - Killing In The Name  "If you fuck with me I'll put my foot in your ass"  N.W.A - Gangsta Gangsta  Mwha! That was quite fun actually. In case ye haven't noticed, I was only joking. But the swearing was great fun. Might swear more in the future.   Thank you Sarah (genuinely) for bringing my "Sandra-ish" style to my attention. Because christ I don't want that. Thank you again. Except now, after the lyrics, you're probably never going to speak to me again. Please do! I need a bus friend! (insecurity and loneliness now blatantly apparent)  Oh well. Have to go. Bastard father stealing modem and hence social life. Cock.  Will maybe do another later when i reclaim modem. If i can be arsed.

      God I'm bored. Hence the need to despair into my blog. Have pretty much nothing to say. Created a Summer playlist today on iTunes so that i have a selection of songs to listen to throughout Summer. Now i have the hard task of finding an album to revise to for upcoming exams. For standard grades i had 'duck and cover' by mad caddies and for highers lagwagon's 'blaze' but what for advanced highers. Possibly queens of the stone age.   Have done 1.5 hours of chemistry today! So now i remember amines and aromatic structure and the reactions of benzene. Speaking of which, the benzene ring is annoying to draw. It either ends up looking squashed or has some weird KKK like pointy hood thing. Either way aromatic chemistry is fun. But that is cancelled by the project. Damn the projects and the 20% of the final marks it makes up. I'm gonna have to kick serious ass in June to get an A. Unless my Arrhenius Equation manages to pull it ooff.--"Everyone has problems, Chemists have solutions"-- Wise words. True words.  Watched Hollyoaks tonight (as per usual) and found out my darling, darling Izzy is pregnant! And two months gones at that. Damn how i wish i was Ben. And why did Dan go down. The writers obviously do not unserstand the basics of soap writing. Characters that are popular (Dan), you keep. Those that people want to drown (Ellie), you kill off. I mean, ok, well done for killing Toby, but Ellie must die. But Linda Barker is still first.  Have sudden urge to go to Megazone. Ahh the good old days of Me and Fraz shooting it up at the weekends. And of course the classic time we got stuck in a tournament. And the crazy guy with the chicken. Hmmm will go someday soon methinks.   Need to get back to school to stop me eating shit. Desperately.  Will leave it here for now. Good Night

      OK I'm a bit tired now but am gonna stay up late as i can. I love you easter holiday. Yummy chocolate eggs. I have figured that hitherto i have blogged with one big long paragraph and thus there is v.little strucure, soo from now on i'm gonna seperate things a bit more and.....whatever. Think i'll start new paragraph now.  Tired!! Result of relatively late nights and early mornings. Not my style. Late nights, late mornings is the way to go. Was in Glasgow (my hometown btw) today with Donald. Got only one thing but it was "Cruel Intentions" for £7 on DVD. So actually not a bad days shop. And then went to Pizza Hut with Stephe, Sandrina and Kirsty and then onto cinema, being joined by Alex and Becky to see Shaun of the Dead. Was actually quite good despite by sceptism before. And was actually very gory for a 15. I mean a guy got ripped apart and his intestines were eaten which i'm sure in earlier days would have constituted and 18 rating. But hey this is good. It means the BBFC are realising people don't give a shit about this violence stuff. Oh while on topic of film, saw the beginning of a film by David Cronenburg (of The Fly and the actually quite good The Faculty fame) in Canada called Crash. Now i'd heard of this film previously and thought it was a deep psychological thing involving people getting sexual excitement from horrific car crashes. Fair enough. However this DVD had the R rated version (american-style rating) which apparently means that it becomes, basically, porn. And seeing as my dad was watching too, decided to put on High Fidelity instead. Which was a wise choice as that's a good film. Now another topic.  Ok, music time. Recently i have been drawn to some intersting new sounds. Firstly, hip-hop. Now i'm not talking about cocks like eminem or 50 cent, i'm talking about the original stuff like N.W.A and Public Enemy. It's actually quite good if you look past the vast number of times 'nigga' is mentioned. Despite the rather 'ghetto' name "Gangsta Gangsta" is a really fucking good song with a cool, funky guitar riff thing in the background. And good lyrics too: "since i was a youth, i smoked weed out, now i'm the motherfucker that you read about" . Apart from that blatantly gangsta shit, i have rediscovered a band i used to like quite a bit called Millencollin. Thanks to broadband connection, i downloaded "Pennybridge Pioneers" and it is full of great songs. Especially "No Cigar", "Penguins and Polarbears" and "Hellman". Seriously good punk rock. And other than those two groups, i've been listening to the usual favourites of Queens of the Stone Age, The Chilis (god bloodsugarsexmagik is good) and the lovely, lovely Norah Jones.  Ooo, now something i have only just properly finalised: the most attractive women on this planet. After much deliberation and uncertainty, I have come to the conclusion that the 5 most attractive women on Earth are, in no particular order:  + Elize Du Toit - well she has a nice body, lovely looks and  that      accent. 'Nuf said Ok. + Elisha Cuthbert - well again nice body and just generally gorgeous, especially in 1st and 2nd series of 24. + Scarlet Johansson - she is just soo pretty and glamorous. + Claire Danes - just really because of "Romeo & Juliet". She is lovely in it. That's all. + ???????? - Hmmmm, for me to know (and apparently everyone else too).   Well fuck, i'm done as it's 2.10am and i'm fecked. Also feeling sick after eating half an easter egg and drinking a litre of diet coke. Think i'll have an early breakfast. Now Jordan Crunchy Crisp or Crunchy Nut Cronflakes????? AHA, both!   Night Night  (OK wouldn't publish this morning so doing so now)

      Ahhh back in the bliss that is Britain. Well even though this place is a bit of a dump, at least we can speak properly and don't say "for sure"  all   the time. And our cars are sensibly sized too, unlike the ridiculous unnecessarily huge 4x4s and pick-ups those weird Canadians have. But getting back here was a bitch. First the flight to Frankfurt was cancelled (!!) and would have had to stay overnight in some dive hotel. No thanks. But as luck would have it we managed to get transfered onto a flight to the greatness that is London! But then as we were about to take off, one of the doors says it's not closed (not literally, obviously) and the plane has to feck off back to the stands. ARGH! Not another fuck-up of a plane surely. Luckily though the door was lying (or at least the engineers said it was) so we eventually flew and hour behind schedule. About goddamn time too. Was sat next to rather attractive, friendly young female Londoner who was training to be an Osteopath. Which was nice considering the person to my left was an old asian granny. Ooo back-tracking slightly watched some really good films while in the lodge. First, Moulin Rouge. Very hectic but it had Ewan starring and Baz directing so I loved it. The ending was very sad too despite the fact you  knew   she was gonna die. Spy Games is another great film, as well as High Fidelity. Oh yeah and Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Was quite taken aback by the similarity between Harry's father and Jeffrey Archer! Scary! I dislike that man too btw. Archer that is, not James Potter. And on the last night watched Jurassic Park for the first time in ages. Quite and enjoyable film. Especially the human eating scenes. Very fun. Mind you no blood. God how fun it would be to do reconstructive surgery on a dinosaur maul victim. In fact I think that's what i'll specialise in, reconstructive surgery (minus dinosaurs hopefully). BUT then I become Mr Weir again after working 5 fucking years to become Dr Weir. Oh well i'd be rich as hell so would i care....YES!!!! I wanna be a Doctor. On a slightly more depressing note my neighbour committed suicide a week ago. So i shall say god rest her soul even though i didn't speak to her. So that was quite sad and sobering. But now on a brighter (yet still maintaining undertones of sadness) I finished His Dark Materials yesterday. And i was brought close to tears. I'll try not to say too much but when Will and Lyra....with the fruit.....they realise....and then have to.....alone......for ever.....ARGHHHH I give in, I cried like a girl (this was in a busy airport too so drew attention of dissaproving machoistic eyes). JK is gonna have to really tear out my heart to beat Mr Pullman on that one. Bloody hell this is long. Shall finish with something I like a lot now:   The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return.   (if only the last bit would work out....ahhh well)  BYE   p.s if anyone i know actually reads this tripe please leave a comment of love and happiness to ease my aching heart.

      OK very quick blog (!?). In Canadia at the moment and had (fucking yeah) 9 days of lovely snow, sore groin, lovely sunshine and an open wound on my leg (cheers father). It bleeds at night, OWW!. As said previously, only got 5 minutes left in internet cafe. Oh not that any bastards read this, maybe bar a  manic hispanic and a crazy irish alcoholic (not any one i know personally btw). There are a lot of attractive female (and male) boarders in canada  though. Not that i'm actually caring. Anyhoo  (crazy canadian accent) i'm gonna go sleep and fly for 12 hours tomorrow (yeah......not). Almost finished amber spyglass and it is kicking cock. Well lovers, saying farewell is such sweet sorrow, that i shall say good noght till it be morrow. Now that  is  Shakespeare!!! R+J btw. BYE!

      Oh dear. I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.  Chemistry is gonna fuck me over violent ammunition style. But wait, i don't need this grade. Ahh well. Captain Chemistry is now Captain Coffee.   But seriously, my body is now dependent on caffeine. Well my brain!  And i am gonna have to agree with you now Sarah. Hugh is hot. Swordfish enlightened me.   Miss Berry....meh! Never really though much of her. Scarlet though! (Vicky from Eastenders. not johanson, Johnson)  Awww i do love Vicky. I hate everyone else!!! And fuck you Izzy for turning into psycho slut bitch! Yes i am lacking any feelings at the moment. That's not strictly true though is it you twat!   Ok i am talking to myself in my own blog. I'm off to drown myself!   BYE!

      Yeah so the last blog lasted like a day. Happy feelings are coming back...slightly...i think?   Well had first exams today. Biology!? Farcical waste of my time!! Weevils!?!? Who gives a flying fuck about them!! Not me. Nor anyone i've spoken to. Hmm cheesils would have been funny. Maybe in a med exam?  But biotech was slightly more interesting. Equally as bullshit ridden though. They can't ask questions at all....losers!  Still cool to get them done. But that means i have like a week until doomsday.   Ah well. At least i have muse!!! And my foo fighters!  But not a fucking en-suite bathroom!! Aberdonian sheep-shagging bastards! Ahem, sorry for my appalling, football derived language. But really, sharing with other people. They had better not steal my shampoo! If they do i will kill them, unless they're really cool. And snowboard. And like coffee. And happen to love Fight Club.   Ok so maybe i won't be killing anyone. Oh unless they touch my toothpaste too. Then i will rip their teeth out!

      Eurovision is so funny. Admittedly i only caught the last ten minutes but that was enough to see the winners. Ukraine.   And Terry 'Boring Old Cock' Wogan wittered some crap about political voting. How about this. Britain is shit!! It's not because of the whole Iraq war and Blair cock-sucking that countries don't vote for us in abundance, it's because the song was bollocks.  Well i don't even know that as i didn't hear the song, but after last year i can just imagine!  Anyhoo (fucking canadians) i have to say that 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is one of my favourite films this year. In fact have i actually seen any other good films this year?   Perhaps the only contender is 50 First Dates!? Well Mr. Astin was very funny. But surely there have been some other films? Hmm apparently not. Oh well  Maybe Troy can sway me. (hehe. ohhh the hidden meaning)  I am apparently happy at the moment. Weird no. Well yes actually as it's a change. I reckon it's just the weather. I mean it's so much fun to be able to wear shorts and t-shirt. Oh, i'm actually wearing a hoody. It's night time, duh!  But my room is seriously fucking hot for some reason. And the heating's not even on. Again weird.   Oh exam leave is gonna be soo much fun. I intend on doing minimal work and sleeping for the rest of the time. And of course drinking lots and lots of coffee (plus caffeine containing products).  Ah well. Think i've ran out of stuff to blabber about so may just leave it here.  TTFN  (p.s - muse are amazing. especially their b-sides strangely enough. origin of symmetry is still outstanding. citizen erased! what a song!)

      Is it possible?? My DVD library is now even better!!  While in Glasgow, i managed to get moulin rouge and fight club as a buy on get one free deal. Amazing.  Hmmm, fight club is actually a film which can appeal to anyone.   For the male audience: guys beating the shit out of each other + acts of terrorism  For the female audience(+ some males): the above + many scenes with brad topless and sweating (and bleeding if that's your thing)  And as for moulin rouge..........it's amazing. no further explanation needed.   Ahhhh, and to round of the day nicely, went to the ballet. Romeo and juliet!!!! Wonderful music. Still not as good as Baz's though and it lacked the classic lines (as it's dancing obviously) but still good regardless.  Ooo, i'm actually getting quite a few comments. Well only from the same 2 people but i don't care. I have fans!!

      "look at my cat. why can't i live like that!"    Exactly. Why can i not live like a cat. They sleep all day and then wander about, get some food and then sleep some more. I wanna live like that.   But when i actually think about it, human existence has the potential to be quite fun. So why the hell is it not. These are meant to be the best days of our lives but they really aren't. At the moment i am so bored i just want to sleep all the time. I do no work in biology, minimal work in chemistry and then i'm forced to work in biotech. When i get home i am too tired to do anything productive so just watch TV and play ROTK. At the weekend i lie in bed and/or watch films all day.   I seriously cannot be hacked with anything. Which gives rise to a problem: what if uni is no different! If that happens i am screwed to high heaven. I will get stuck in a hideous cycle of apathy and boredom.    And how the hell can a 10 year old kid be celebrating a 6 year anniversary with her boyfriend!?!?!?!? She has had a boyfriend for three-fifths of her entire life. Really not helping raise my spirits. Very, very depressing.  Coffee cannot help me now.   Pass the class A drugs.

      Hmmmmm. Maybe i should cheer the fuck up more often.   OoOoOoO....i have my beloved Queens of the Stone Age back now. yum.   ...and only a few days till exams are over!! For....well, a few months at least.  OK there is really nothing interesting in my life. Yawn! BOOOORING!!  I think i know now that either strawberry cheesecake ice-cream or raspberry yogurt is the key to my heart. Quite possibly coffee too.

      John Frusciante is no longer jesus...he is God!   Since he no longer has his long girly hair (he buzzed it off to those not in the know) i feel that he deserves this new title. Well, that and the fact that he is pretty fucking learned on the guitar. Can you say "learned on the guitar"? Hmm i think i will. Anyhoo, he is amazing! He just extended the ending of 'Easily' for about 5 minutes just going crazy. It was above his head!  Well apart from the chilis, NERD are cooool! Maybe i shall buy the album. Or steal it from someone.   On a down note, i am biologically fucked!!! We have 2 exams on tuesday??? ehhh what!? No-one told me that. Hmm or i didn't listen. Either way i am gonna crash and burn.   Why the feck is nobody in school either? It's so booooring. I just end up watching snowboard videos on ucas computers. Shaun White is quite the dominator. And the same age as me. Bastard!   Oooooo fighting in neighbours! Aghh, but not as good as Big Brother. Bodyguards, Police investigations... "i'm gonna fucking kill you". Oh goodie. Finally some really good action.   Why is there a phallic dessert in neighbours? Well Izzy seems to be enjoying it. Whore! Hmmmm and Max. Ohhh, Izzy is a bitch!!   Bored now. BBLB time!!!

      Kids!!!!! I usually maintain some level of tolerance for the little fuckers, but when they steal all the seats (with help from the bastard parents) for The Prisoner of Azkaban, all tolerance is turned to bitterest gall!   But hey, at least i got to see Van Helsing instead!!   Mmmmmmm...Kate Beckinsale. I have discovered my new celebrity love!   And my attempt at reclaiming a social life wasn't too bad either. A night of drinking and good chat. Oh, met Alex and Anna too. Very lovely people.  WOOO! A week until the chilis!!!! Oh yes! I really hope they play Sir Psycho Sexy. Oh and If You Have To Ask! In fact, if they played BloodSugarSexMagik from start to finish that'd be amazing. And then threw in the great tracks off Californication and By The Way. OHH! There're far too many!!

      Oooo i haven't blogged for a week. Meh. People don't read this anyway. Guess what..  ...God No! Things are good!!! Finished SQA exams (ergo finished exams as A-Levels are too fucked to be bothered dealing with). Ahhhh. Soo good! Especially considering i thought chemistry went OK. Hmm that's tempting fate. Ah well. Do i need them!?! NO!!  And i am now seriously worried about the UK and it's lack of sexual restraint. Apparently a survey showed that 1 in 3 under 15 year olds had had sex!!! Ugh. The kid's are all wrong dammit!  Why has my mum stapled the bag of nachos together? I can't eat them now.  Ohhh finally! After a long time i am gonna be regaining something that resembles a social life tomorrow. First, prisoner of azkhaban with Fraz, then a night out in Stirling! WHEY!! Alcohol! The great beer/baileys combination is coming back. Maybe leave the vodka and cider this time. They don't really mix well.  Right. I'm hungry. Doing nothing is tiring y'know. And then some sleep. Ewww. Have been having rather unpleasant dreams recently. A few nights ago that irish gardner (dermot something) was telling me i was a shit snowboarder!! Even though he was so much more crap. Apparently i was being reckless? Bastard. He can only achieve silver in the Chelsea Flower Show so he can fucking talk!! Anyway, last night my teeth broke in half!!!!! Agghh!!! Was very scary and horrible.   I want my nice dreams back!!! Please! Woo. Chilis in 8 days!

So as a permanent reminder of myself&nbsp;to any person that looks&nbsp;at this randomly some time in the future...i give you&nbsp;a little piece of...."My Lovely Man" by&nbsp;the Red Hot Chili Peppers   &nbsp;  " Just in case you never knew
