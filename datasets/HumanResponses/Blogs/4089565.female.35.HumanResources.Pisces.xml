       Well, we went into town shopping today, and did our custmary stop at the DQ.  I really, really wanted to get a Medium Chocolate Dipped cone.  Instead, I got a kid-sized vanilla cone, and it really was just as good.  DH found some junk candy, you know, those boxes like you get at the movie theater,  for 98 cents  at Walmart.  You would have thought he found the Holy Grail! LOL  I didn't even look at what all they had, surprising since I love candy.   On the way home DH  were talking about my wanting to lose this weight.  I imagine this extra 68 pounds won't be too good for me down the road, and that I better get a handle on it now rather than later.  I have been lucky so far, to not have any weight related problems.    I told him that I want to be able to walk into a room and not look for someone fatter than me so that I can feel better about myself.  I do that alot.  As a matter of fact, that's the first thing I do when I am in a social setting.   I even compared myself to the women at DQ today, as I noticed one of them had an enourmous "bootie shelf ", and found myself wondering if I were that fat.  Shameful behavior for a grown woman. (But the answer is no, I wasn't bigger than them..LOL)

        urlLink    Me with my mother June 04. I definitely inherited her body type... And lifestyle. Time this girl eats right and exercises!! (That was about me mom! You can do whatever you want..)  Like mom, up until now, I have lived a very sedentary lifestyle. I was never taking time for myself, and never paying attention to how much I was eating.

        urlLink    Me, with my father, the 58 year old running machine. Taken June 04  Dad, dear Dad.  Always getting slack because he always talks about how fit he is and how much he runs.  Dad takes time for himself and eats right.  He puts himself on project status.  His wife Mary runs with him too..

Did Richard Simmons "Sweat and Tone" 30 minutes (after driving all over creation looking for an exertube to use with it.  I swear, those things used to be all over the place!  Finally found one at K-mart, only to return it the next day as it was the "strongest Resistance" one out there, and I couldn't use it! Wimp wimp!)  Then, after dinner that same night, I felt like walking... I went 1 1/2 miles in 27 minutes.  That's it, my first week done!!

       Well, I started Tuesday morning, actually late Monday night when signed up as an online member of TOPS. I just can't be this heavy anymore. I'm embarrassed to look in the mirror any more. So, I decided, it's just time to do it.  I am married to a WONDERFUL man who has stayed by my side, and thankfully, tells me that I am beautiful no matter what. He has seen the pounds come on with each pregnancy..And never leave. He himself has gained a few too, and it has come to the point he needs to shape up again..As being in the military, the rest of his career  could  depend on it. He now gets up early early and runs, so now I get up too so I can get my exercise in before the kiddies get up and the chaos starts. Actually, I am too embarrassed to let my dear children watch me exercise. Sad, but true.  So I hit the treadmill on Tuesday morning, and managed to do 15 minutes. Yep, that's it. I started writing down everything I eat too that morning, as well as use my TOPS NUTRIBASE software. This let me put in my weight, age, height and activity level to determine how many calories it get each day. Hmmm, 223 pounds, moderate exercise, that gives me 1938 calories each day. Seems like a lot doesn't it???  I also set some goals. My starting weight is    223.5    and I have set my goal weight at      155   . This means that I have 68.5 pounds to lose.   Only 68.5 pounds. Good Lord!!  I will do this by:  1. Keeping a written record of what I eat 2. Watching my serving sizes..Using portion control 3. Drinking   HALF my WEIGHT   in water each day (that's 112 ounces! Float!), plus adding 8 oz for each caffeinated beverage I drink and for every 15 minutes of exercise I do. (Float, Float, Float!!) 4. Exercising 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week.     I HATE EXERCISE!!     I really, really do. I have a collection of "exercise stuff" I can do including Windsor Pilates, Pilates for Dummies, WW In Shape DVD, WW Fast Track DVD, Richard Simmons  Groovin in the House , Richards Simmons  Tone and Sweat , and a Treadmill..phew!!  I decided since I have sooo many choices, I would write them all on a slip of paper (along with 2 off days) and pull one out each day, and that's what I'll do that day. Hmm, will that keep me from getting board?? If Pilates is picked, I'll do 15 minutes on the treddy too ;)  I will be weighing myself every Tuesday morning and I will post it here for all the world to see!!  I set a short term goal too, to get below 220 pounds. Easy, measurable..   MET  GOAL AUG 10 2004!!  Whooo Hoooo!!

       Well, had to get new shoes. The others just were not going to do. (hey, a woman needs good shoes right?)  So, I give the idea to my husband and he is prepared to put out 50+ dollars for a new pair of shoes.  Then, the Sunday paper comes.  I'm looking at the Target ad,  and they have a nice pair of shoes in there.  Can you believe it, they are only $11.  But, I want Nikes or New balance, you know something that costs alot , and of course will be excellent quality, just because they cost more!!  I go out to town, and I am trying on shoes.  I come home with $11 shoes.  No kidding. ( My husband comes home with $17 dollar running shoes.)  I kid you not, these are made just as well as any other more expensive shoes, and are just as comfortable.  We have both worn them for exercise, and are more than happy with our purchase.

       Back in October, I joined WW and by Feb had lost 27 pounds. They showed me I could eat reasonable portions of normal foods and lose weight. I sure loved the gimmick of the Points program, plus the cutesy little book to track my points in. At that point, lemme tell you, there was no stopping me as I had reached the end of my rope then, couldn't stand to look at myself!!  Then, it dawned on me one day, that it was ME who made the difference, not the gimmick. So I quit going. I was doing fine, losing a pound , here, a pound there, you get the point. Making progress none the less (wasn't exercising though, as you know how I loathe that..)  Spring comes along, and we talk of going back home to visit my family. Talk about stress, I could do a separate blog about how stressful visiting my family is. Instead of talking about it, I began to eat. And Eat, and eat, and I ate all the way through our vacation. If the 1765 mile trip through Fast Food USA wasn't enough, it was the pizza pig outs and un-healthy eating with the family that killed me. I found myself within 6 pounds of where I began in Oct.  Something was said about my coming home that really bothered me and recently I really made a connection about it.  My parents are divorced, and up until a few months ago I had a strained relationship with my father (mom too). My sister just now talks to dad. Anyway, my mother made a comment to my grandmother (dad's mom) that the reason he *probably* doesn't have a relationship with us (the girls) is because we are fat like her. OMG!!!  Alright, you know that I already case public places to see if I am the fattest one there or not. Going home was horrible for me because of the "acceptance" factor to begin with. "What will they say when they see how fat I am?"  I walked into my fathers house for the first time during that visit, and my step-mom hugged me and called for my dad. We hugged, he stepped back, and said, "What a beautiful woman you are. Mary, isn't she pretty?"  That in itself changed my world. He, in that one sentence helped me to begin to accept myself. I cry just to think of it again.  Listening to a radio program yesterday, that was taped in Feb 04, I heard Dr. Rankin speak. He said that a key to weight loss success is the emotional factor. He said.. self acceptance becomes a barrier to success. How true. Thinking about going home, worrying about what people will say about me, caused me to lose track of my goal.  Right now, I am back on track, the connection has been made again, and I am happy ;)
