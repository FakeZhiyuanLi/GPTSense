      A subset (or is it a power set?) of The Parallel Campaign is currently running a reading group on the philosophy of Alain Badiou, focusing particularly on Peter Hallward's Badiou: Subject to Truth, and the recently translated collection of essays, Theoretical Writings. A more detailed listing of the areas covered will be posted, as will hopefully a recording of some of the remarks and insights gathered therein.

      A number of questions arise in the wake of the interesting contemplations that took place in the first contribution to our fledgling discussion forum, questions which for the moment I can only address in a preliminary form. Principally the questions that concern me draw from simply considering: What is the relationship between poetry and philosophy? (is it philosophy’s other?) and further, what are the stakes apropos of their respective claims over thinking?   In the context of Nietzsche’s thought, certain possible answers seem to appear: Thus Spake Zarathustra does indeed seize the initiative by generating a “symphony of thought.” However, one wonders whether such metaphors actually resolve the problem or, on the contrary, just defer it. After all, what sense does this metaphor actually draw from us? – Are the operating conditions for thinking in Nietzsche musical? Perhaps we can infer from Schopenhauer’s continued influence over Nietzsche (even during this period) that music, understood as a non-representational art form, in an unresolved consistency, perfectly expresses the movements of an implacable will (music then, as the language of suffering). From hereon in we can perhaps conceive of the operation of thought swaying precisely in the poetical dithyrambic movements of the text, lured into the rhythm of thinking, a thinking which is at once ruptured against the unfolding revelations of the last man, the übermensch, and the eternal recurrence. But to ask again here, what then is the dithyramb? Are we claiming it is the condition of thinking? Has poetry then not taken on a distinctly ontological significance? It is interesting of course to observe that at precisely these points ostensibly Nietzsche becomes a problematic figure for the history of philosophy – that is, a potentially anti-philosophical figure.   Now this claim is made so often that one might wish to reject it immediately on account of its superficial temerity, yet I suspect that to dismiss it in such a manner is to fail to address the very real difficulties in Nietzsche’s work not merely in its assault upon the academy and the challenges that arise thereof, but also for any serious practitioner of philosophy – that is, anyone who wishes to uphold metaphysical discourse. Now Nietzsche can of course himself be labelled a metaphysician, indeed the metaphysician of all metaphysicians if we are to follow Heidegger – one, that is who sees through the history of philosophy but critically, with his investment in the notion of the will to power, fails to draw the right conclusions. Yet Nietzsche is surely closest to slipping the metaphysical web for Heidegger when he announces himself in the form of poetry. However, what becomes clear with Heidegger, and this should be immediately merited for Nietzsche as well (though without the same degree of philosophical rigour), is that poetry is a very particular discourse engaged in only by the few and the rare. To enter into poetry in these terms is to draw into an authentic singular relation, a relation which Nietzsche properly designates as untimely. It is clear at this point that poetry in this sense, that is, as the language beyond metaphysics, is something very different from anything we are normally given to investing in the term.  To consider Nietzsche from a different direction, it is, of course, unquestionably significant to draw attention to the systematic motivations within Nietzsche’s thought (e.g. Time Atom Theory) but more particularly Deleuze’s remarks about the Genealogy. Deleuze’s careful systematic, indeed scholastic, treatment of Nietzsche is indeed welcome. However, there are a number of points apropos of Deleuze’s treatment that are worth recognising here and potentially hazardous oversights which we should be aware of. Firstly, the conflation of the poetical TSZ and the Genealogy is misleading in terms of the development of Nietzsche’s thought, and more precisely, in the way in which Nietzsche’s thought develops as we shall see. It suffices to say here that the systematic operations within Nietzsche’s work during the period of TSZ are entirely distinct from the Genealogy – and subsequently the concerns with “Zarathustrian poeticism” are no longer evident in the Genealogy. Secondly, Deleuze picks up particularly on the Genealogy and his recognition of it as a Kantian style post-Darwinian Critique serves to direct us towards his own metaphysical project. The result of this is that Deleuze overlooks the most distinctive feature of the Genealogy – that Nietzsche drops the transcendence of the eternal recurrence.     	 Returning to TSZ, the poetical transcendence exhibited in the text is suggestive of a mystical referral or access to being. This movement, “the movement of thinking,” which turns out of the history of metaphysics: does it remain outside of this history? Or are we reined back in? The former case scenario implies that we all effectively give up the metaphysical dialogue and become poets, or philosopher-poets, the latter that we return to Nietzsche as a metaphysician (who makes a pragmatic tool of poetry) as the vitalist thinker of the will to power.   What do we find in the wider reception of Nietzsche in this respect? On the one hand, swathes of contemporary literature praising Nietzsche’s poetic philosophical effusions, his transcendence from the metaphysical sphere in a gleeful aesthetic dance; on the other, the attempts to seriously ground out Nietzsche as a metaphysician (whether in the French Deleuzian tradition, or as a hermeneutical or even neo-Kantian reclamation typical of the German response).   In the wake of this schism one thing is clear: for those who take Nietzsche seriously, for those who take the death of God seriously, we are always left feeling remarkably short changed. Of course, the literary-poetical posturing response to Nietzsche will continue to trade on the interdisciplinary ambiguities between literature and philosophy and process more and more books precisely on the back of this apparently productive void. But who then is this Nietzsche? Every time it is the romantic Nietzsche. How then are we to understand these literary-philosophical responses? Are they not after all failed novel(ist)s?   But let us situate this claim and draw its significance by tracing this question of the romantics back to the appropriate point of departure. What we discover of course is that the thought of philosophers becoming poets, or at least philosopher-poets, does not first arise as a serious consideration with Nietzsche, but with the early German Romantics, and hence I would argue with fragmentary discourse (the discourse of finitude) and the birth of modern subjectivity. Thus it is here, with the German Romantics, one should refer to really get to grips with the significance of the relationship between poetry and philosophy.   It is interesting what the stakes are when registered from the early Romantic point of departure. From this outlook we gain an entirely different perspective, a perspective that perhaps fulfils our suspicions: it may surprise us, but we must seriously ask ourselves has not poetry since the Romantics been entirely in the ascendant in the continental tradition? Badiou offers a remarkable insight on this point:  “if one considers the status ascribed to poetry and mathematics by Plato, one sees how, ever since Romanticism, they have swapped places and conditions.” (TW: 25)  Our pleasure at this recognition at first cannot help but sever us from the sneers of the analytic mind who has failed to register the significance of this victory – we might even humour ourselves in this light for a moment as poetic. Isn’t this after all what we wanted? In this respect Nietzsche acts like a mirror to our own desire – perhaps because with him the struggle was most palpable. But what was this struggle against? The answer rings clearly enough: romanticism.  What is romanticism for Nietzsche other than the clearest symptom of décadence and decline? – it is in other words, the seedbed of what Nietzsche would later align with nihilism. In the Gay Science aphorism 370, Nietzsche explores the question “What is romanticism?” and plays between various formulae to distinguish the Classical (or rather “Dionysian pessimism”) and the Romantic urge to create (over-fullness versus impoverishment of life). His analysis however, is here only a staging of how he himself bears its burden and more and more clearly traces it back to himself – Epicurus is now a romantic, Wagner and Schopenhauer are now romantics. What is clearly evidenced in this passage is Nietzsche’s developing understanding of the romantic condition – yet it is also clear that from the perspective of the early German Romantic (Schlegel, Novalis) he does not know what a romantic is. Further, his own mode of production is far more drawn into the romantic tradition than he at this time suspects, or dares to acknowledge. As always with Nietzsche, these are masks he is casting aside, projecting distance from these caricatures even as he identifies them more clearly with himself. What then would nihilism be if not the very point at which he has cast aside all masks only to recognise the process of production itself? – it is here that we suspect Nietzsche is thoroughly romantic, a romanticism which unleashes itself most fully in the astonishing folly of Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Zarathustra, following in the wake of the Gay Science is the full-blown ecstacy of romantic production.  Once it is recognised it can hardly be denied – Zarathustra is the romantic gesture par excellence to the event of the death of God. The formula: Existence is suffering, the suffering of a finite being in a world divorced of God. The problem to be resolved: How can existence affirm life? In its dithyrambic refrain Zarathustra pursues Nietzsche’s metaphysical preoccupation with the question of finitude and the One – that is, the singular event of the eternal recurrence.  Zarathustra, following on the back of The Gay Science, is thus the thought contusion in which Nietzsche principally works through the problematic of the modern condition, assessing the severity of its symptoms in modern consciousness. The eternal return is the concept he gifts with the weight of an answer to the burden of finitude – the greatest of all weights. It becomes the very heading under which man can still call out “I love you, O Eternity” (Z: 3, ‘Seven Seals’). However, in the winter of 1884, Nietzsche began adding a final part to his work, a part that in terms of its poetic power and inspiration is undoubtedly of lesser power than the others. What then was taking place here? Nietzsche it seemed, had blown a gale, but was now beginning to falter – were the metaphysical cracks beginning to show? The eternal return is once more affirmed at the end of the fourth part, but had this become something of a parody?   Prior to the writing of the Genealogy of Morality, Nietzsche’s evolving response to the eternal recurrence becomes suddenly remarkably ambivalent in a superbly lucid entry in the notebooks entitled “European Nihilism” dated June 10th, 1887. Here, our response to this development and its potential unfolding significance for Nietzsche’s ontological concerns hangs particularly upon the reading we give to the passages 15 and 16:  “Who will prove to be the strongest? The most moderate, those who have no need of extreme articles of faith…who can think of man with a considerable moderation…the richest in health, who are equal to the most misfortunes and therefore less afraid of such misfortunes… (15)  What would such a man think of eternal recurrence? –” (16)  The implication it appears to me, is the recognition of the need of the recurrence being no longer necessary, of it having essentially become acknowledged as precisely an extreme article of faith that to the healthy and the stronger type is unnecessary – indeed, it is a thought that still bears the signature of having been cast in the very same fire that animated the first withdrawal of the Christian God – and thus ultimately fails still to think beyond it. What is remarkable about this passage and the Genealogy that immediately followed is how the desire for metaphysical significance is set aside in favour of a method drawn out of a socio-political analysis via a genealogical method.  To turn back to the early Romantics at this juncture, what was very particular to Romantic speculation was the introduction of historicism to philosophy, a thought which “established itself as a horizontal structure for the historicity of the finitude of existence” (TW: 24), a thinking which, as a projection of the limit as a horizon and the theme of finitude is entirely alien to mathematics. The stakes of this for Badiou are nothing less than entirely obstructing the significance of the death of God by reversing the Platonic conditions. From the Romantics through Nietzsche, into Heidegger (who gets so far only to reintroduce poetry as the proper, the language of being), poetry issues as the productive ontological site of philosophy and is specifically introduced, and thus tied to, the language of finitude (the language of authenticity, etc). The seriousness of this implicit tie between the introduction of finitude and poetry has potentially grave consequences for Badiou; namely, “that we do not possess the wherewithal to be atheists so long as theme of finitude governs our thinking” (TW: 26). He clarifies this point further:  “In the deployment of the Romantic figure, the infinite, which becomes the Open as the site for the temporalization for the site of finitude, remains beholden to the One because it remains beholden to history. As long as finitude remains the ultimate determination of existence, God abides. He abides as that whose disappearance continues to hold sway over us, in the form of the abandonment, the dereliction, or the leaving-behind of being” (TW: 26).  Our co-extensiveness with time maintains in us a “tacit God” (TW: 26) delivering us over, via the medium of history, to “a new avatar of the One” (TW: 27). What the matheme offers as a productive ontology is the infinite inscribed in terms of a “neutral banality” – by returning mathematics to its proper place within philosophy and simultaneously banishing finitude and historicism, Badiou claims, only then “does it become possible to think within a radically deconsecrated realm” (TW: 27). If the language of infinity is for Badiou properly to be understood as mathematics, then the language of finitude is poetry. Furthermore, the finite, grasped as it is “in the pathos of mortal being” (TW: 27), is “in thrall to an ethical aura” (TW: 27).  What is this ethical aura of finitude? – it is an essential pathos that a finite being communicates in its singular relation. Insofar as romantic philosophy localizes the infinite in the temporalization of the concept as a historical determination of finitude, ethics is limited to a particular configuration of language – a language which in rejecting the metaphysical identification unfolds in a more originary enacting of being. But is its pronouncement necessarily configured in terms of the One? That is to say, must poetry as an ontologically originary operation, emit the singular relation of being as a discourse of the pathos of finitude? As Badiou elucidates:  “On the one hand, the ethical pathos of finitude, which operates under the banner of death, presupposes the infinite through temporalization, and cannot dispense with all those sacred, precarious and defensive representations concerning the promise of a God who would come to cauterize the indifferent wound which the world inflicts on the Romantic trembling of the Open” (TW: 37).  What then is poetry in terms of an ontological determination if not the language in the wake of a mislaid God? By turning to poetry, philosophy continues to breathe the decadent air in the final throes of nihilism – that is, it renounces metaphysics only to continue to passively give in to the intoxicating fumes of the One. In Nietzsche’s beautiful hymn to romanticism, Zarathustra, we witness precisely the confirmation and seal of this tendency – poetry emerges out of, and returns to the singular evental structure of the One in the eternal return. In this moment, Nietzsche commits the romantic error of failing here to properly think multiplicity and of evidencing within his own thought the language of romanticism – finitude. In doing so, in his proselytizing fervour he fails to think through the implications of his own thought and continues to attach himself to the One. In contradistinction, Badiou emphasizes:  “there is nothing but infinite multiplicity, which in turn presents infinite multiplicity, and the one and only halting point in this presentation presents nothing. Ultimately, this halting point is the void, not the One. God is dead at the heart of presentation” (TW: 37)  In romanticism a reconciliation between philosophy and poetry has already taken place. This reconciliation is drawn to its completion with the deposition of mathematics from philosophy in the work of Hegel where a rivalry is set up between it and philosophy with respect of the same concept, the infinite. What Badiou holds to is the termination of the romantic introduction of finitude into the work of philosophy and this implicates a radical caesura of philosophy and poetry – a break true to Book X of Plato’s Republic. Tying philosophy to the language of finitude fails to effect an atemporal break with established discourse the effect of which is to devastate philosophy rendering it “homogenous with the historical power of opinion” (TW: 30).   In his essay “Language, Thought, and Poetry,” Badiou concludes that it is fatal for philosophy to give up the mathematical paradigm, for what lies in its wake is merely the wreckage of a “failed poem” (TW: 241). In contrast he similarly claims that objectivity inflicts a mortal wound to poetry, turning it into “didactic poetry, a poetry lost in philosophy” (TW: 241). In the final analysis, Badiou summons us to celebrate the quarrel that lies in the midst of this schism for ultimately with respect of thinking one can after all recognise a common task:  “Let us struggle then, partitioned, split, unreconciled. Let us struggle for the flash of conflict, we philosophers, always torn between the mathematical norm of literal transparency and the poetic norm of singularity and presence. Let us struggle then, but having recognized the common task, which is to think what was unthinkable, to say what was impossible to say. Or to adopt Mallarmé’s imperative, which I believe is common to philosophy and to poetry: ‘There wherever it may be, deny the unsayable – it lies’”(TW: 241 my italics).

      Dear friends,  I want to offer a subject for discussion that I have already discussed at length with some of you and which I think is of interest to us all. I will try to give some thoughts upon the issue and to give some passages from a new book on Nietzsche that I think could provoke some discussion.   I suppose that there is something repulsive about the student of anglo-american philosophy who says that he finds Nietzsche's works to be nothing but 'literature.' When someone said this to me I did however wonder whether it was really an insult since it shows Nietzsche to have been open to using literary style to explore philsophical issues. Of course the speaker really meant that being literary Nietzsche gives out only wholly 'subjective' pieces of flowery language.  On the one hand we have Nietzsche's Time-Atom Theory(1873) in which a very analytical style is used to argue that time is not a continuous series. Against this we have the poetry of the Dithyrambs of Dionysus. Two different styles. The Genealogy of Morality is systematic enough for Deleuze to suggest that it is Nietzsche's re-writing of Kant's critique. However, Thus Spake Zarathustra seems more a piece of prophetic literature. This simple opposition between 'poetry' and 'thought' falls apart when we consider the truthbehind Deleuze's description of Thus Spake Zarathustra. He called it a symphony of thought because within it thought moves.   I have started with a very simplistic an inadequate definition of the terms 'poetry' and 'thought.' Of course, seeing poetry as bound to subjective relativism wrongly ties it to a supposed sollipsism of the poet. Poetry can be intensely subjective and personal but this doesn't stop there being poetic truth, truth about the world and existence bestexpressed through poetic inspiration. Nietzsche powerfully portrays the intensely personal and'subjective' experiences of the human being into the terms of Willing as opposed to any interior andpsychological ego. If we take the Will to Power to be a form of externalism we find that the ego becomes a state or point upon a broader canvas. Therefore, we cannot draw a distinction between the philosopher as a seeker after objective truths and a poet as a seeker after wholly 'subjective' and relativistic experiences.  The fact that truth is often attacked by Nietzsche as a reactive way of characterising or 'reading' reality shouldn't mean we have to assume that Nietzsche wantsto be a relativist. What survives the Genealogy and trasnvaluation is of course going to be complicated and hard to grasp. The Will to Power as a standard of truth allows Nietzsche to make very real and credible what were before denigrated as merely relativistic and subjective experiences. Poetry is in this sense liberated - it is able to capture reality by embodying forces that before were not considered fully or properly real.  Nietzsche will value the ability to think in different ways, to have different perspectives. Poetry must complement a relentless logic and vice versa. This does not mean we have no truth but that grasping truth demands virtuousity of thinking. I think Nietzsche calls it a 'gymnastics' of thinking. Kant was prone tothe occasional literary flourish and no one would denythat these all to brief moments are compatible with, and take further, the force of his rational arguments.  'Oh! how happy we are, we knowers, provided we can keep quiet long enough!...'['On the Genealogy of Morality,' p. 5, ed KAP, CUP(1994)].  The book I would like to select passages from is Alenka Zupancic's 'The Shortest Shadow: Nietszche's Philosophy of the Two', The MIT Press, 2003.  p. 7-8 Nietzsche was an 'anti-philosopher' but 'Nietzsche didnot oppose himself to philosophy, for instance, in the name of a more artistic mode of expression; ...Something else is at stake that could be formulated in these terms: to locate the point of the inner limit,or the inherent possibility, of a given discourse(...), and to activate this precise point as the potential locus of creation.'  p. 15 The subject must travel a certain distance in order to'take place', to 'happen' at the point of the Other thing. 'Zarathustra is the epic of such travel.'  p. 94 Truth is not an epistemological category but a matter of courage.  p. 97 Perspectivity does not make all truth subjective and partial for Nietzsche. If we relativise everything we hold onto a 'last solid truth' that there is no truthand in this we can still take refuge.  p. 98 Perspectivism is not a point of view but is truth engaged in life. It makes truth immanent while scepticism excepts itself from the situation it describes.  p. 99 'Is there a perspetive that belongs to no subject, and that no subject could claim to be his or her own, although there would be an intrinsic link between this singular perspective and the constitution of every subject belonging to this situation? The Nietzschean enterprise concerning a new notion of truth is heavily dependent on the answer to this question.'  p. 122 Truth can only take place within life, in the 'middle' of life.  I hope this makes sense and is of interest.  Best wishes, Edward

       During my research I recently stumbled across this rather perverse little fragment and thought I might introduce it here:       "Socrates, who, according to his statement wanted to ask the wise in the underworld whether they knew something or not, may get hold of Hegel in order to question him about the absolute method. Perhaps it would become evident that Hegel, who became so extra-ordinarily absolute in his earthly life, which ordinarily is the life of relativity, would become rather relative in the absoluteness of eternal life." [K., JP II 1606]        - the gadfly of Copenhagen registers an impolite sting on the nose of the great systematist...

      Dear friends,  I would like to offer a posting in response our continuing philosophy and art problematic and also as an attempt at a response to Scott's fascinating recent posting. I would like to be provocative in offering ideas from Deleuze that unavoidably conflict with the ideas from Badiou that Scott discussed. This is perhaps appropriate given that this is possibly the most pressing dichotomy in early twenty first century thought (if that is not too bold a claim).  I found very insightful the tracing of this whole problematic back to the Romantics and forward into Badiou's great syntheses. This transversal elicited in me both admiration and also stirrings of my Deleuzian sensibilities (perhaps I should say ‘of my Deleuzian pretensions’ since I feel myself to be merely at an early stage on the path towards grasping this great thinker). I hope that I can do justice to Deleuze's encounters with works of art.  Deleuze launches into a creative criticism of Kant in 'Difference and Repetition' by expressing dissatisfaction with the status and power given to sensations. They are already formed and given to a passive self. We might say that the Kantian epistemological machine seems to have something missing. For Deleuze the doctrine of the faculties is based upon a repression of the real nature of sensation. He wants to find sensations that force us to think (he sites this idea as a highly positive contribution by Plato). He uses the term 'sign' to denote sensations that are a shock to thought. Instead of sensation being finished and given it is challenge to our thought. Signs can only be sensed or felt since to allow them to be represented would be to falsify them. They are an element of reality neglected by representational thought. They are singular and cannot be generalised. They also bear a problem (for Deleuze a problem is not something defined by its ability to be solved but is a denial of general and common solutions [Deleuze (1994) p. 161f]).  The conclusion that Deleuze draws from this dissatisfaction with Kantianism, and representational thought in general (the dogmatic image of thought), is that we must innovate in our approach in order to liberate sensibility. He proceeds dramatically, in the pages of 'Difference and Repetition' and elsewhere, with the reunion - perhaps in the spirit in Kant himself - of the two senses of Aesthetics that appears in the Critical System. These two halves are said to be artificial because they limit the power of sensibility to be an activity of thinking itself. In the Transcendental Aesthetic we have a theory of the forms of experience and in the Third Critique we have the work of experimentation (cf. Daniel W. Smith, 'Deleuze's Theory of Sensation: Overcoming the Kantian Duality' in "Deleuze: A Critical Reader", 1996). The Kantian arrangement forces sensibility to play a part in the working of the faculties in two different positions that do not allow its genesis in the fully unity of its power and force. Now, the artwork is not a representation but is an experience and a way of exploring the sensible. Instead of being either a form of receptivity on the one hand and creativity within the sphere of aesthetic contemplation on the other, it is a full 'being of sensation'. This explains why Deleuze can say that his writings upon art are works of philosophy in a very literal sense.  In ‘Difference and Repetition’ we can grasp the in-itself of difference and repetition as repetition of difference within the work of art. If art were a mere matter of psychological activity it would remain separated from the activity of thought. Deleuze finds this artificial because it denies the autonomy both of sensation and thought. He tries to illustrate how everything removed from the continuum of living reality is mistreated and alienated. If we remove ourselves from this in our thinking we cannot think equally or adequately to the activity of sensation. This is elaborated in ‘A Thousand Plateaus’ where music is said to harness the forces of cosmos. Music can become a ‘cosmic sound machine’ since it is not a representation of cosmic forces that are the elements of reality and constitute sensation. It is plugged into them and thus traversed by them. Unless thought is seen to be this transversal force to which the rhizomatic (open onto the outside, onto the multiple) is subject we cannot truly think. Whether we take the later or earlier vocabulary we find that art is a science of the sensible because the artistic composition of the sensible is affective in and of itself. If we consider the work of art from this viewpoint of creation then we begin with the being of sensation itself and this allows us to think immanently to this activity of sensation. It allows creation to have the autonomy as an event in itself and this makes the subjective processes and responses of the artist and viewer a secondary occurrence. To paint becomes not at all representation at a distance but a composition of forces in the work. This is a true apprenticeship to signs since it anticipates and presupposes nothing about the occurrences within sensation. Aesthetics achieves immanence to sensation and thus bypasses the categories of representation.  The ultimate expression of the new status of art in the Deleuzian universe is its ability to think with a nobility equal to that of science and philosophy. Deleuze evokes the status and evocation of the work of art in words that he wrote with Guattari:     ‘The thing has become independent of its “model” from the start, but is also independent of other possible personae who are themselves artists-things, personae of painting breathing this air of painting. And it is no less independent of the viewer or hearer, who experience it after, if they have the strength for it. What about the creator? It is independent of the creator through the self-positing of the created, which is preserved in itself. What is preserved - the thing or the work of art - is a bloc of sensations, that is to say, a compound of percepts and affects.’ (‘What is Philosophy?’ p. 164)  If percepts can exceed the strength of those undergoing them, sensations are beings in themselves and in excess of the postulates of the dogmatic image of thought (representational and similar). Just as Kant’s Ideas exceed cognition, Deleuze’s Ideas are signs that implicate sensation in a virtual object = x that is nevertheless immanent to the virtual-actual dynamism.   If we conceive of sensation as the realisation of differential relations, we open ourselves, in the experience of the artwork, to the full force of forms of thinking that are harnessed in the composition itself. In ‘Difference and Repetition’ Deleuze argues that ‘difference must be the element, the ultimate unity’ so that divergence and decentring must be affirmed (p. 56). The identity of everything is swallowed in difference so that each thing is only a difference between differences. For Deleuze thought that is equal to difference must express in itself the being of sensation and compel the apprentice to signs to follow its realisation of thought. Deleuze recognises in modern art a ‘theatre of metamorphosis and permutations.’ This ‘labyrinth without a thread’ is outside or in excess of the logic of representation because sensation is not formed or mediated but allowed to draw the viewer into the fullness of immanent sensation itself. Transcendental empiricism is Deleuze’s project and it is not simply assisted by the work of art but this is its very realisation. This non- representational thinking realises the life of sensation itself, it espouses vitalism by being itself a vital movement that shocks the subject. Thought becomes the realisation of signs occurring in situation, immanent to this continuum. The categories of the dogmatic image of thought seek to impose the values of representation, the similar, mediation, analogy and so on (a full list is given on page 167 of ‘Difference and Repetition’). This makes the work of art the immanent realisation of the undoing of this dogmatic system of postulates for the apprentice to signs.  Centring this issue around the thinking of difference, Deleuze makes clear that the repression of difference is the poison of many presuppositions with which philosophy begins. The work of art is a composition of differential relations and their realisation in the repetition of differences that includes difference without mediation. Rather than the giving of form to sensation it is a realisation of the forms of sensation themselves. This is involuntary and violent, it is a shock. Francis Bacon seems to concur with this when he writes of painting that:  ‘The story that is already being told between one figure and another begins to cancel out the possibilities of what can be done with the paint on its own.’ (‘The Brutality of Fact’ p. 23).  Figuration can have a similar alienating role in painting as that which representation has in philosophy.  Deleuze extends his ideas to Proust’s ‘In Search of Lost Time.’ He latches onto the difference of the former present (as it was lived) and the present present. These two series have an identity and resemblance (the madeleine, breakfast, the taste that coexists across two moments) but this is not where the secret lies. This is the surface but at a certain depth is what the taste envelops, this is something = x, something without an identity. This is Combray as it is in itself, which exists or insists as virtual. It is essentially different and as differenciator it produces the identity and resemblance of the series. These coexist in relation to the Combray in itself as object = x which causes them to resonate. This movement of thought within the novel is not a something that can be represented by generalities. The singular manifestations of difference in the forces composed by Proust are signs that very literally carry their apprentice in his journey. They are productive of a resonance between the present present and former present as two different series where the workings of difference forces thought upon us. Involuntary memory is shown most truly in this composition that embodies the interaction between the virtual and the actual, it presents sections of this activity.  In my last entry I offered some tentative perplexities about Nietzsche. He does not seem to offer any of the great workings out of approaches and of the workings of reality as Deleuze does in a systematic and pluralist fashion. Yet he is a pluralist (in the sense of an empiricism that is open to the divergent and multiple manifestations of life and the world) and this seems to overwhelm our attempts to get hold of him. Deleuze’s book on him is a reasonable approach to grasping the workings of the Nietzschean reality (feel free to attack me on this point). If we limit Nietzsche by claiming that he avoids all systematic thought on principle, it seems that he fails to cope with the disorder that he recognised as the great challenge for thought. Yet what did not kill him could only make him stronger. This strength suggests an engagement with this challenge; the attempt to capture in thought something that is too strong for us. Perhaps this can only be done in a limited and embryonic way or as a shadow (if it is only the overman who is to experience thought fully).   I take Scott’s point that metaphors such as a ‘symphony of thought’ resolve the problem by simply deferring it. This I think points to the need for Deleuzian reading of metaphor as metamorphosis. If the work of art is a composition of sensation or force, we avoid ending up with a metaphor that is a form of representation artificially disembodied and isolated from the forces that composed it. The same goes for metaphors used in philosophy, creation with concepts rather than sensations.   The problem that Scott dramatizes in terms of two opposed receptions of Nietzsche’s philosophy, as either a ‘gleeful aesthetic dance’ or taking Nietzsche as metaphysician is I agree important and unsatisfactory (what indeed, could be more tame than a mirror to represent our own enthusiasms). If aesthetics is separated from philosophy (as a sober continuation of metaphysics or as its successor) then Nietzsche seems to be lost in this division. Yet with Deleuze I think we see a way into reading Nietzsche without needing to make this moribund separation.  The issue of the finite and the infinite is a fascinating transversal. Deleuze’s thinking attempts, using diverse materials and encounters, to establish the unity of thought and art in the immanent workings of difference. Artistic experimentation produces instances of this incarnated unity. Deleuze would perhaps argue that the infinite should not be presupposed through temporalisation as Badiou suggests in one of the quotations Scott uses. Instead the Eternal Return should be the formless being of difference since only in this synthesis is difference affirmed as it should be. The work of art as an immanent section of sensation testifies to the mechanisms of difference. Ultimately, the virtual object = x, through itself, is the differenciator of difference. The fully adequate and fully immanent excess. Deleuze warns that a conversion of the excess to the void would reintroduce the transcendent. He prefers the dice-throw (involving the affirmation of chance not as probability but as fate) on the site as a power of ‘making’ the event. Otherwise……  ‘philosophy thus seems to float in an empty transcendence, as the unconditioned concept that finds the totality of its generic conditions in the functions (science, poetry, politics, and love). Is this not the return, in the guise of the multiple, to an old conception of the higher philosophy?’ (‘What is Philosophy?’ p. 152-53)  Badiou is criticised for his theory of multiplicity because it does not offer two multiplicities (two types) from the start. This is necessary according to Deleuze because multiplicity happens between the two and this avoids the need for the transcendence that Badiou offers to compensate. These two types of multiplicity are one beside or against the other and not one above the other.               I expect violent condemnation from the rhizome that Brian and Scott have formed with Badiou (don’t spare me insults).  Best wishes,  Ed

      Dear Friends,  1. I wanted to add some more thoughts about the subject under discussion and related to my ongoing study of ‘Difference and Repetition.’ The nature of differential mechanisms in the virtual is very important to this issue because if actualisation involves a synthesis of depth it can be hidden and covered over on the surface but never removed. Even the singular does not get away from this depth because the singular is universal thanks to its rooted-ness in this dimension. To understand the role of the artwork in transcendental empiricism we can look at this universality of the singular. This concerns our ability to dispense with general or natural laws that ignore this depth that is revealed though thinking difference itself. The actual is rooted in the virtual to the extent that every object has a double aspect. This is expressed by the coupling ‘clear-confused’ as an individuated or singular unit. This is a state of actualised individuality and it defines the individual as being both local and global. It is locally clear and yet also globally obscure. This follows because the universality of anything, according to Deleuze, is not at all an impersonal abstraction. If it were then we would have a simple and empty repetition. If repetition is a repetition of difference we must say that ‘The highest generalities of life, …, point beyond species and genus, but point beyond them in the direction of the individual and pre-individual singularities…’ [p. 249] The individual is in this way expanded since we can think its universality without resorting to a representation that removes its concrete singularity. This singularity relates to the instance of actualisation as a production of the virtual. If this is ignored the rooted-ness of the actual in the virtual is covered over and the singularity not seen in the vital context of its progressive determination. Individuality thus becomes part of a global process and is not seen as a closed and static object. The objectivity of what is actualised belongs to this process itself. This double nature as ‘clear -confused’ gives the object both its singularity and its global connection or implication. Whilst being made clear by the focus of its singular actualisation, it is confused by its connection with global movements and processes such that a zone of indetermination surrounds the individual. This makes it open confusedly onto the cosmos in a way that anticipates the more radical thinking present in ‘Capitalism and Schizophrenia.’  2. Deleuze elaborates this idea by constituting the life of empirical reality through intensities. All intensities are implicated in one another so that each continues to express the changing totality of Ideas, the ‘variable ensemble’ of differential relations [p. 252]. This communication via implication is about the expression, production or incarnation of the actual. The connection of intensities opens up the product of actualisation to wider reality. At the same time, each intensity expresses clearly only certain relations or degrees of variation. It focuses upon these in its enveloping role. Yet as something enveloped and incarnated it still expresses all relations and all degrees, but confusedly. In this sense, the clear-confused is an expression of the production active in the virtual-actual circuit. This means that whilst the world is made coherent in a seemingly general and human way, ‘the advent of coherence is no more our own, that of mankind, than that of God or the world.’ [p. xxi] Since individuations are impersonal, the singular is universal in being produced continuously by a virtual depth and yet singular by virtue of being a specific and focused instance of actualisation. In this sense the event is both unique and rooted in a universal synthesis of depth and also of time (the eternal return).  3. Perhaps the most concrete illustration of the clear-confused in ‘Difference and Repetition’ is Deleuze’s reference to Job at page 7. Job challenges the law by dismissing the general in order to reach the most singular as principle or as universal. This is not an example of existentialism. Instead it expresses an excess over the general ways of representing reality that would limit it to human forms of calculation and thought. Instead, that which escapes all calculation, prediction and explanation is invoked in concrete despair and attunement to the singular. Job’s experience of the universal had everything to do with this overflowing in the intensity of his singular situation. To return to the question of the artwork, it must be able to capture sensation that is singular and yet which embodies the universal in its very singularity. This is the ‘being of sensation’ that is in excess of general or natural laws. Only through the singular do we capture this excess that is lost in the representation of generality. The artwork is able to present this excess by avoiding the logic of representation in its harnessing of the forces of sensation.  4. Deleuze elaborates this excess immanent to sensation when elucidating ideas of ‘the dice-throw’ that makes the point of actualisation aleatory and singular. With characteristic perversity Deleuze invokes a peculiar image of divine creation: ‘… God makes the world by calculating, but his calculations never work out exactly, and this inexactitude or injustice in the result, this irreducible inequality, forms the condition of the world. The world "happens" while God calculates; if the calculation were exact, there would be no world.’ [p. 222] Without this preservation of difference in the unequal there would be no production of the new, no change, no occurrence. There would be simply stasis and no production of anything: ‘…the unequal in itself which testifies to the existence of a natural "remainder" which provides the material for a change of nature.’ [p. 238] The artwork is supposed to capture or harness universal forces active in sensation that testify to an excess of difference that covered over by representations of general and predictable laws. This makes difference the being of sensation and its sufficient reason. The artwork captures the rooted-ness of the singular in the universal workings of actualisation. In this way the universal is concrete and alive rather than being drained of all vital and immanent process as it is in representation. Deleuze elaborates this in terms of a ‘signal-sign system’ in which every phenomenon flashes. This is made up of at least two heterogeneous series that communicate with signals. Without the unequal, the differential that differentiates these systems of differences (object=x), there would be no reason or being of the sensible. If there were sameness and identity there would be no motor of actualisation and the artwork would just represent things and not actually think difference.  5. An amusing comment by Deleuze proclaims that good sense is the ideology of the middle class [p. 225]. As such it is less acting that foreseeing and a belief in predictability. Perhaps this is rather apt when it comes to the artwork. The bourgeoisie protest that they like representational art because they want it only to be pleasant and perhaps soothing. They want it to flatter their own belief in the correctness of their way of life were everything or ordered for their material advancement without anything troubling their sense of self worth. Was there really ever any representational art other than that produced for the middle classes? Difference is for Deleuze that which cannot be thought. It is excessive and does not fit into the limit of our ability to comprehend it. Yet it is something that thought cannot avoid thinking about because as excessive and differentiating it is productive of sense and of the actual. The artwork embodies this un-thought or imperceptible that shocks us into thought. It is not given but which the given is given through depth that is differentiating, the un-grounding ground [p. 226]. We find in this the vocation of the artwork because as creator God is faced with interval and distances to fill (Deleuze offers these ideas whilst considering Plato’s Timaeus). He covers everything with intermediaries [p. 233-34]. Yet he ‘dances on a volcano’. This is the virtual depth constituted by difference. If in the artwork (Klee being a good example here) the abstract line is clear and yet confused it is because it is abstractly universal. The line captures the universality of movements that produced the singular line. It captures what we are forced to think without being able to fit it into manageable thought. The middle classes like to manage things and so management speak is utterly alien to the thinker and the artist.  6. I hope this is clear. Deleuze weaves together his thought using very rigorous concepts and yet these are so complex that capturing this rigor in one’s own words is utterly difficult. My main purpose here has been to further my attempts to expound on Deleuze’s aesthetics via his ideas of depth and the virtual that continuously implicate the sensation that artworks capture or harness within something global. Deleuze complains that whilst Schelling and Schopenhauer think depth they do not manage to preserve difference within it. This is an issue we could go into in the future. For now, the question I suppose I would put to the Badiouians in our midst concerns the value of thinking difference whether in the artwork or in anything else. Deleuze’s approach seems to remove the problems of dualisms by making this difference not at all a problem but something to be positively affirmed and in which to find the vital mechanisms of life. I am not sure if I could give this up. Forgive me these bold statements. Best wishes, Edward
