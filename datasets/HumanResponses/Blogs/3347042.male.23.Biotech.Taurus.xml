      It has been a long week.  For one thing, I got a new apartment down in Valencia, California.  It is a very nice place; an 847 sq Ft one-bedroom.  I can actually see Magic Mountain from my kitchen and balcony.  I move down there in the middle of next month.  I am pretty excited as it will be pretty much my own place.  Thursday was my last college midterm ever.  I had a Physics 133 midterm.  The test dealt with magnetism and how a current in a wire and a magnetic field act on each other.  It was a very hard test and I will be happy to have a 50% on it.  Too much is going on which means I didn't have time to sit down and study hard for a midterm.  Friday I saw Shrek 2.  I have to say it was as funny as I expected.  I think the casting of John Cleese as the King of Far, Far Away was excellent.  Mike Myers is the perfect choice for the ogre.  Although I enjoyed the movie, I didn't like the theater experience.  I made the mistake of going in the early afternoon and there were a lot of kids, some of whom decided to cry through most of the movie.    That's it for now, as I have a Senior Project paper to write.

      Well, today I had hopes of going to the rifle range to try out my four military rifles.  I have a Russian Mosin Nagant 91/30 in 7.62x54R that was made in 1942.  I have two Indian made Enfield Mk 1 No. 3* in .303 British. I also have the Yugo M48A in 8mm Mauser.  I haven't had a chance to shoot these rifles and I was hoping that today would be the day.  It started out nice enough; a warm sunny day.  My friend Patrick knew of a place in the nearby National Forest where target shooting is ok.  We decided to try our luck there and not at the actual rifle range.  This shooting area is off some dirt road and since neither of us own a 4WD vehicle, we decided to take my Saturn.  To make a long story short, we drove for over two hours in the middle of nowhere on some horrible dirt road in a car not meant to go off-roading.  We never did find the place to shoot but we did manage to ford some streams in the Saturn.  We made it back alright, albeit a little dirtier.  I still need to shoot my rifles though and I hope to do that some day.

       urlLink    A Glock 17 9mm  Today I went with three friends to the local indoor shooting range.  We rented a Glock 17 9mm and got 200 rounds for the four of us.  It was the first time I have ever shot a pistol.  It was quite fun.  I was not very accurate, as to be expected but my aim did improve during the day.  I must say that after doing that I wouldn't mind having a pistol and going once a week to the range to do some shooting.

      Today I took some time off from my senior project to see Troy.  Now, before I give my thoughts on the movie, I must say that I generally love well done epics.  I count Lawrence of Arabia as one of my favorite movies.  With that in mind, I would say that I disliked Troy overall.  I thought the dialog was poor and for the most part poorly delivered.  Leaving out the Greek gods was a mistake.  I also need to rant a little on the use of computer graphics in cinema.  It has become plain to me that many of today's directors use computer graphics too much.  Computer graphics are still not truly ready to completely fit into a depiction of a real world.  The Greek ships in the movie were easily seen as computer graphics.  I think that maybe a combination of miniatures and computer graphics would have been a better choice.  I could continue ranting about this movie (and maybe I will later) but right now I have other things to do so good night.

      Today I was able to spend some quality time with my Senior Project.  By quality time I mean around 14 hours.  That is right, I spent the majority of the weekend trying to compile my own version of the Java Virtual Machine.  I am so sick of staring at the terminal while seemingly random messages and compile warnings flash before my eyes.  With luck this will all be over soon.  I hope to spend all of my 'free' time on senior project so that I can have finished before I go through the graduation ceremony on the 12th on June.  One of things that has kept me going is the knowledge that I have a job waiting for me when I get out of school.  The majority of my graduating classmates are not in the same boat and I do not envy them.  I think that is it for now as I am mentally exhausted.

      Today I watched "The Wind and the Lion."  For those of you who don't know, this is a movie about U.S. Military intervention into an Islamic state.  This sounds very familiar.  To be more specific, the movie deals with a Muslim brigand kidnapping an American woman and her children in Morocco.  The Sultan of Morocco won't use his troops (which are mostly German soldiers on loan) to stop this brigand and thus President Theodore Roosevelt sends in the Marines.  I really did not enjoy this movie mainly due to the fact that Sean Connery was cast as the main Muslim character.  It is hard to become immersed in an epic film set in the desert when the main Arab has a Scottish accent.  I also thought some of the other actors were hamming it up a little.  The best part of the movie is the portrayal of TR.  The actor seems to capture the essence of the great man.

      Well, I have decided to create a blog.  It seems to be the sexy new thing to do these days and I figure that I should get on before its too late.  I don't know exactly what I plan on doing with these blog but I do intend it to be a dynamic and organic thing.  I will most likely just write down whatever I am thinking (which will most likely take the form of rants).  I think that's it for now as I have nothing else to write about.

       urlLink      urlLink      I finally was able to take out my rifles this Sunday.  I must say I was impressed with my four rifles--they all worked!  Its amazing to think that these old rifles still work as well as the day they were made.  Of my four rifles, my Yugo Mauser is my favorite.  It has the worse kick of all the rifles I have but it has a nice balanced feel to it and good sights.  With it, I was able to hit a harddrive from about 30 yards repeatedly from a standing position.   As you can see in the pictures, the bullet did a lot of damage exiting the harddrive.  This is due to the fact that were we shooting soft point bullets.  Its funny, the picture of me shooting was taken when I was not shooting one of my rifles.  The rifle I was shooting is a .223 caliber rifle that someone else had brought and that I was trying out.  Overall it was a fun day.

      Yesterday was the last day of regular college classes I will ever have.  Even if I decide to get a Master's degree, it will be through work and thus I will not have regular classes.  It still hasn't dawned on me that I will be a college graduate in a few days.  Once again, I am very happy to have that job lined up.  Only two finals separate me from my degree.  I have my Sociology final on Tuesday afternoon and my Physics final on Thursday evening. Speaking of Physics, I stopped my Physics professor's office yesterday to pick up my final midterm test.  Surprisingly, I got an A on it.  When the professor saw the grade, he asked if I was a Computer Science major.  I told him that I am indeed a Computer Science major.  At that point he then said that I was not scoring the grades that is typical of Computer Science major--I was way too high to be a computer science major.  Its nice to know that I still have some intelligence after years and years of public education.

       urlLink      The very first photo from my new camera.   &nbsp;  This is the first photo I have ever taken with my new Canon 300D.&nbsp; I bought the camera yesterday at Best Buy.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the view from my balcony, nothing too fancy.&nbsp; I am currently using a 16MB CF card to store the pictures on, which means I can take 4 photos before the card is full.&nbsp; Sometime next weekend I will have two 256MB CF cards which will allow me to store a lot more photos. &nbsp; Sorry about not updating this recently (like anyone reads it) but I just haven't had time.&nbsp; I have been busy graduating from college, moving, and starting a new job.&nbsp; I hope in the future to keep updating this site more often.
