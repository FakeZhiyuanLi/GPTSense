Remember me when i'm gone away, gone far away into the silent land; when you can no more hold me by the hand, nor i half turn togo yet turning stay. Remember me when no more day by day, you tell me of our future that you planned: only remember me; you understand. it will be late to counsel then or pray. yet if you should forget me for a while, and afterwards remember, do not grieve: for if the darkness and corruption leave, a vestige of the thoughts that once i had,  better by far you should forget and smile, than that you should remember and be sad.

      A few stories i wanna share with you  A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales. the teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human even though it was a very large mammal, its throat is very small. the little girl stated that John was swallowed by a whale. irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible. the little girl said, "when i get to heaven i will ask John". the teacher asked, "what if John went to hell?" the little girl replied, "then you ask him"  A kindergarden teacher was observing her classroom of children while they were drawing. she would occasionally walk around to see each child's work. as she got to one little girl who was working diligently, she asked what the drawing was. the girl replied, "i'm drawing God." the teacher paused and said,"but no one knows what God looks like." without missing a beat, or looking up from her drawing, the girl replied,"they will in a minute.  The children had all been photographed, and the teacher was trying to persuade them each to buy a copy of the group picture. "just think how nice it will be to look at it when you are all grown up and say,'there's jennifer, she's a lawyer,' or 'that's michael, he's a doctor.' a samll voice at the back of the room rang out, "and there's the teacher, she's dead."
