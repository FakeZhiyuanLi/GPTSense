        It's always fun to slave away at work. Though what I do is hardly slave labor. It's hardly labor at all which is why I want to lay down. My right ear is deaf. My left eye is blind. I'm only have hear. (hah) I'm only half "HERE".&nbsp; Goshy.    Guess Ha-What? It is the day of Thursday, and i'm guessing you all know what that means! (Oh wait. You don't. Neither do i.)   I could go for some apple pie right now, or cherry for that matter. I knew you knew that. I wish i knew. I'm clueless at the moment. Waiting for answers. I should know why the sky is blue but I don't. That can be answered though, as can everything else.  I think I'm going to change my name to "Far a n". It seems that spelling it with the double "a" makes more sense in the long run. Even though&nbsp;the name spelt that way&nbsp;is pronounced quite differently. What do I know, I always accent the wrong letters. It's a different perspective. I don't see many people asking "Karen's" if they spell their name "Kar a n". There should be zero problems, and maybe only 1 error.  Error: Bewilderment.  I'm going to marry Blogger and maybe have a child named Frogger. He's going to be a computer programmer. He's all about digetalness. He'll pass up dreamcast and game cube. He'll invent his own domain. Then teleport into the circuits. I hear the electric flow feels nice.  Maybe if I fall, I'll be held back for a little-tiny bit. Or if a dog attacks my ankles. Who would wish that upon theirselves? Not Me!
