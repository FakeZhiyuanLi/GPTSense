      So I am now on the train and was just telling my buddy AL, via text message, that there is some weird shit in the air lately. We have recently seen two major viruses come around and when I was walking on to the train I hear 3 bums, all in different locations, screaming about J.C. himself. Now, I am not into the whole end of the world thing but I do know when shit is acting weird. I don't know if it has to do with the Democratic National Convention or anything. Anyways, let me explain my buddy AL.  AL is a cool dude and you would hardly miss him if you saw him. He always has some sort of gym short on underneath his pants. Also, one tell tale sign that you are around the AL are the extreme colored fingers from puffing a marlboro red all day long. One day, when I was on my way to work, I looked over and saw the AL laying almost completely flat in his truck. The only way that I knew it was AL was the look of a shuttered beard and smoking marlboro. AL is always good for a political view here and there. I like his views and can see how he can piss people off sometimes with them. One thing is for sure...the dude can slay you in an argument about politics. My buddy Ryan just got toasted (although he will say otherwise) by the AL a couple days ago over some George Bush shit. AL is good, cherish the AL, learn to live with the AL cause there are many more like him out there.  Next to me sits this lady who I think is somewhat of a bitch. She usually sits next to me and spreads her bags out and shuffles her papers. The weird thing is that when she sits like this, if you walk by her, she sighs about the littlest thing!! I hate that when you are on the train and politely ask to get by, go ass to front, and people still think you are being rude. Hey, do you want me to turn around and shove my dong in your face!?!?? Then stop fucking bitching about me walking past you to get off the train.  I heard over the weekend that Ricky Williams retired. Ya know, I really feel kind of glad for the dude. I mean, I don't know him or what his situation was, but I do know that having the type of personality and pressure on him that he has dealt with has got to be nuts. All this dude did was "LIKE" football..he didn't love it..he fucking liked it. I like a lot of things but none pay me 3.5 million a year. I think that this dude just loves to get high and go hang out and play video games...nothing bad about that. Anyways, fuck you dave wannstedt since you fucked the bears for as many seasons as you did. I am glad you are suffering with Travis Minor and some other douche bag.  Anyways...I think I will end it here...take care.

      Well, after a hard days work I am on the train ride home and listening to the cubs on my wireless pcs card via my laptop! Pretty awesome! Anyways, across from me are a group of kids. Now, I don't mind kids, I really don't. I just hate when you have to deal with kids that whine, piss, and moan about everything while their parents just sit there and don't say shit. One kid was telling the other kid to eat some fucking fruit!! Let me tell you something; when I was a kid, the last thing on my mind was eating fruit!! I hope that when I have kids and they are on the train I don't hear one of them ask me for fruit. I was like 6 when I asked for a beer from my old man. The crazy bastard gave it to me!!!  Anyways, the day today was pretty stressed. I came back from a day off and had to play catch up for a bunch of shit that I missed out on yesterday. It sucks because we have this huge thing going down monday and....Oh jesus, these fucking kids are playing with their GOD damn fruit rolllups. I want to yell at them and tell them to sit the fuck down and quit playing with their food!!! There are like 3 girls and one little boy...the little boy is the one that pisses me off the most. Everything that the girls do the little boy asks to do also!!! I swear, this kid (the little boy) better grow a pair of nuts or else MY kid is going to grow up to kick his ass and my kid will be like 7 years younger. I can't wait to point this little punk out to my kid! I will remember you....you little sister wanna being fruit rollup eating chode!!!!!   Well, my stop is coming up and I figure I should save this. Take care.
