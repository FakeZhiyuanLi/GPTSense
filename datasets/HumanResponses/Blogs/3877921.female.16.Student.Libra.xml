      By  Sixpence None the Richer      I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    All the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine       I'm waiting for answers  I'm waiting to figure it out  I trip on my chances  I slip through my doubt    I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine the sunshine        well it seems that my weakness  is sometimes my only strength  and in my incompleteness  you get your way    I'll be around   and I will find my way back down  and I'll see the sound of the sun     I'm going nowhere and I'm going to take my time    all the questions in the world I can leave in my mind    I'm waiting on the sunshine, the sunshine        the sunshine

      Wow. I can't believe how fast the summer's gone by. But WAIT! It's NOT over yet!! You know, if I was in school right now, the next 2 weeks and 1/2 would be a really long vacation. So I have to keep thinking that way. Not  School's almost here,  but  2&1/2 week Holiday.  Hey, that's longer than Christmas break. I'm not too anxious or whatever about starting again, it's just the same old, same old to me. I always like to get new clothes! That's the fun part, of course. Everyone is so scared about seeing people again. It's only been 3 months! Not three years! And like, who really cares what ppl think about you. So I don't look totally different.~ So what? I've given up on the whole must-try-harder-to-improve-my-look craze, I just wear what I like &amp; have my hair and make-up the way I want it. I remember in 8th grade I would wake up at a quarter to 6 sometimes so I could get my face and hair just right. Now I wake up at 6:30, and spend a 30 minutes on all of that. (mostly because it's early and it takes forever to wake up) Anyway, I'm rambling.. as usual.
