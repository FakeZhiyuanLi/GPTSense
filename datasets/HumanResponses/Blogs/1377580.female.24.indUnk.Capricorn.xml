      In the process of packing to move to my new apartment today, I found my old diary.  It is my diary from 1996 - early 1998, my last two years of high school, and one entry from University.   Oh god, though.. the nostalgia!  It was so weird to go back and read that stuff from being 16 and 17 years old.  It brought everything right back, remembering how good it felt thinking the guy you liked might like you; the doubt I felt when Doug started spending a lot of time with Olly; the depression I felt over our breakup; the despair I felt when I found out he was going out with Olly; the relief of finding myself 'over' Doug, and being able to be friends with him again; the elation at wondering if Blair liked me and finding out he did; the crushing sensation when we broke up and blaming myself.. the craziness that was our post-relationship relationship.. just a whole lot of feelings whirring around.  I even had an entry about how I felt about hearing that Princess Di had died.  It took me right back to that very second when i was writing the entries and experiencing those emotions for the first time.  I could say I now have the Benefit of hindsight.. but I wouldn't have had things any other way than the way they happened.  (and Doug and Blair if you ever read this.. Smile and Wave you're now famous in a very limited kind of sort of way.. )   High school was such a weird time of life.  I was a total geek at  urlLink high school , but I had so much fun.  Reading my diary brought back a few vivid memories:  The graffiti in between the science block and F block that said "jah rasta" on it.   Running cross country and stopping off on the beach for a quick dip in the ocean before going back to school  Rolling the skirt of my school uniform up to make it shorter  Watching the cloud of ash from the  urlLink eruption at Mt. Ruapehu  come north towards the Mount from my English class in F Block.    The school lip sync (ooo outrageous!) where I was Kimber from  urlLink Jem!  and me and my friends created an awesome entry, complete with Mortal Kombat facedown and gun battle between the Holograms and the Misfits, where of course, the Holograms won.  I bought the video of it, but I have no idea where that went.  I would love to have a copy no matter how embarrassing.   Waterbombing the kids who had to run the cross country, when we were in 7th form.  We went round to Tracy McCutcheon's house and threw waterbombs at all the 3rd and 4th form kids.  hehehe.  I tried to dunk a teacher, but ended up getting drenched in the ocean myself.. nevermind, he got his too.. hehe.   Watching Oprah and Ricki Lake, not to mention  urlLink mtv uk  during unsupervised 'study' at the seventh form common room.  The video's I remember most from that time - Bittersweet Symphony,   urlLink The Verve ; Karma Police & Paranoid Android,  urlLink radiohead ; I'll be missing you,  urlLink Faith Evans  &  urlLink Puff Daddy ; Bitch,  urlLink Meredith Brooks .  I didn't say they were the best songs of 97, just the ones that I remember most from watching MTV Europe at that time, probably because they got the  most airplay.  I do love Radiohead though, so don't be saying shit about them.   Writing Flump with my friends.  Flump was a magazine we made up to take the piss out of teen girl mags such as  urlLink Dolly  and  urlLink Girlfriend  magazines.  Flump was pretty much dedicated to hacking down  urlLink  Dieter Brummer  of  urlLink  Home and Away   "fame".  Remember  urlLink Peter Andre  and his song Mysterious Girl? (No?  Then thank your lucky stars), we made fun of him too.   urlLink Brian Austin Green  was a favourite target as well.  I only hope that one day someone will realise the immense value in Flump, and archive the historical issues.  It would be nice if someone paid us to make it for a living too. :)   My first kiss was a week before sixth form started.    Making out on the seventh form common room after a party at the mount rugby club.  The other participant in this will remain anonymous.  (I don't kiss and tell)  Running away from Tracey Miller in 3rd form, but getting stuck with her and pretendiing to look for the others to catch up with.  Until Emily came and rescued me, and we left Tracey by her self.   Bike racing home with Kahn Day.   Standing spontaneously with my class for the National Anthem when our teacher asked us to stand.   Asking our science teacher about Botswana to distract her from the lesson, any time we didn't feel like learning (i.e. every lesson).   Watching the  urlLink Lost Boys  during science at the end of the year.  I flove that movie.    The Seventh Form Ball pre and after parties - sipping straight tequila from my date's hip flask, and thinking I was SO fucking cool.  My date, David, was from Hamilton.  I thought that was pretty fucking cool too.  David really wasn't very cool.   We laughed about him for so long afterwards because he was on his school's Tug of War team.  ummm, yeah.. go mate, go.   Chillin with my best friends, the famous five plus Nardz.  Making peace with Hayley (love her) who had previously (apparently) wanted to beat me up.  Converting everyone from the "I hate Lynda" club, to the non-hating members.   Smashing a frozen Jucie against my forehead to be admitted as a member of TSUM - The Student Underground Mafia.  We even had our own secret handsignals.   Co-ordinating an uprising against TSUM (secret of course), where we had Blair give the main TSUM members (Lex & Pete) a copy of a ransom note and tape from our renegade order.    Sitting on the field at lunch, sunbathing.. hiking up our skirts as far as decently possible, and browning our legs.    sooooooo many memories.. but now my apple martini is gettnig to me, and my typing is going awol.. so i am going to have to go now. hehehehe.    more later.  damn that diary for making me remember everything! To all my friends, you know who you are, and you'll never know how much you really mean to me. :) ( i must  be drunk, random sentimentalism is coming through!)

      This is a cool site that I have heard about for a while, but finally went there today..  urlLink one word .  Pretty much what it is, is they give you a word, and sixty seconds to write about it, whatever comes into your mind.  I think its pretty cool.    Today the word was "Princess".  This is my entry; I wish I was a princess. Princess' have fairy powers, and no problems. Princess' get to wear pretty gowns, and are always beautiful. True Princess' always marry the Charming Prince. I wish I was a Princess, even if Pea's are deadly to me.   Pretty lame, I know.

      I'm feeling a lot better about everything tonight.    I talked to my UM about part time positions at  urlLink fucktard land  and she is going to work with me on it. yay.    Also, I checked with Columbia and I can take summer Gen Ed classes @ Truman college this summer.  woo to the hoo for cheapness and cross-credity happiness.    I also have a rant about the lack of decent women directors in Hollywood - but y'know what? I'm fucking tired.   good night.

      *warning - incoherent, babbling post to follow*  ARGH!  I’m so upset.  I feel so fuckin crazy right now.  I just made a complete fool of myself - I was crying all the way home on the el.  I wonder what people think when they see a girl like me crying uncontrollably in public.    All I have ever wanted in my life, is to have the job of my dreams.  I never wanted the traditional stuff, the family, the husband, the mercedes, the kids or the dogs.  I just wanted to do what I wanted with my life, and to do it well.  What is the job of my dreams?  I feel so embarrassed to put it out here for everyone to see, but I want to write and direct movies.  Such a huge fucking thing for me, a little girl from Mount Maunganui, but its my dream.  It's MY dream.  You can laugh all you fucking want to, but its all I ever wanted since I was old enough to know.    I'm not afraid of hard work - in fact, whats the point of achieving something if it cost you nothing?  Is it your achievement if there was no pain?  I want to work hard.. I just want to work towards my goals, something that I know is, in some way, helping me get that little bit closer to my dream.  I don't know if I'm talented enough to get there, but god, I just want to try.  Its the one burning thing in my life.    Anyway, so this might not seem like much to anyone else, but I'm so tired of these continuous fucking set backs.  I'm "lucky" enough to find myself living in Chicago, a place with so many more opportunities in film than Mount Maunganui, but yet I feel like I'm further away from my dreams than ever before.    First off - there's the aforementioned pathetic, good for nothing bureaucracy pathetic excuse for a government organisation - the Immigration & Naturalisation Service.  I filed for my green card two fucking years ago.  where am i right now? Probably about $2000 down the drain, and no fucking green card.  No Green Card =  No Financial Aid or govt. loans.  No financial aid means I have to pay for all my education up front.  My chosen school,  urlLink Columbia  is so fucking expensive - i'm taking one course this semester, and it is costing me $1500.  I don't get any financial help whatsoever, and I don't want to be 30 when I finish school.  I've looked at other schools in the area - but for film in Chicago - there doesn't seem to be anywhere thats worth going, except for Columbia.    Second off - there's the poorly run pathetic excuse for a University that is Columbia.  Oh, the courses seem ok - well, as much as I can judge from the less than one course I've completed there so far - its the administration.  This is what happened this week:  I get a letter telling me my appointment for Fall registration is 11.30am on May 8 - a Thursday.  Well.. because of my lack of financial funding, I have to work full time for Corporate America (we'll talk later about this particular degradation), and therefore, I'm not fucking available at 11.30am on a weekday.  So I call the Records department - who rudely say "If you can't come in during the day, when did you expect to take classes?"  "Well, I was expecting to telepathicly project a hologram of myself to a class during the day - No, dumbass! I was going to take night classes, just like I do THIS semester!"  (things I wish I'd said).  He informs me that I can only register Monday to Friday 9-5pm.  Tough for me if I work.  Well, sounds like Columbia is firmly planted in the 21st century, where it is extremely rare for people to work and want to study at the same time.  Maybe they haven't tried to pay their fees lately? Hmm.. should we ask:?  Rude Rep Boy puts me into the voicemail of the registrar and I leave him a message to call me at work.   Registrar Man tells me that I can actually come down and register until 6pm, today and tomorrow only.  Well, I know traffic is going to be a bitch tomorrow, and I'm lucky if I'll make it to the South Loop by 6.15, and they will not be waiting for me then.  So I ditch my spinning class that I was looking forward to so much, and head straight down to the registration office - because I need Columbia to hold my hand and help me to register.  I'm not able to do that by myself from my home fucking computer.  No.. three prior years of University (thank god for the superior NZ education system and government.  Also, technologically savvy uni's that don't hold your hand, and give perfectly good courses over the internet) and I can't be trusted to make a decision for myself.  FUCK YOU COLUMBIA.   Anyway, I make it down there at like 6.05 - and I manage to get somebody to clear me to enroll - only because I was just about to burst into tears right in front of them.    I sit down to register, and the only two fucking classes they're offering that I don't already have credit for, or that I have met the pre-req requirements, are during the day.  Great.  I made people stay late to enroll me, and then its all for fucking nothing.  Well, I am cleared to enroll now, so I have to find something fast - by tomorrow to be precise.   I wish I had rich parents, or financial aid, or a suger daddy or some fucking thing to pay for my education - even if I had to pay them back, so that I don't have to work full time to pay for rent, a car to get me to and from work etc etc et fucking cetera.  But I do.  So there.    Ok, so I'm a little calmer now, and I realise that this really doesn't seem so big.  But imagine this one thing that you have really wanted your whole life, and really believed that you could achieve it if you just worked hard enough - and more and more it seems like the powers that be are conspiring to keep you from achieving that?  Thats how I feel.  My whole life is about this one thing, and I can't even comprehend that maybe, maybe I wont be able to do it through no fault of my own.  Oh, god.. here come the tears again.  If I worked hard my whole life towards this, and then didnt make it - because I just didn't have the talent, or I didn't have what it took, or whatever.. i would be ok with that.  I would be ok with that, because at least I would have had the chance, and given it my best shot.  What the fuck do I do, when I am trying so hard to make that chance happen for myself, and its just not happening?   I hate my job, I am a corporate fucking whore to  urlLink Hewitt Associates .  Can I get an Amen from all you other corporate whores?  Such is the paradox of my life - I work to live, but work takes over my life.  In the end I have no time for the things that I work to afford in the first place.    I was brought up to believe that you can have anything you want if you work hard enough for it.  I think to a certain extent it is ture - but in a society like america, it is less so.  America is so geared to the privileged and the rich.  If you belong to that elite class, then doors open everywhere for you - especially if you're white, and/or male.  America might not keep minorities down by segregation and outright racism now, they just keep em poor.    (disclaimer - I am 'white', and not poor - thanks to being a corporate whore - and neither do I think of myself as underprivileged, but I have realised that there are certain opportunities that are taken forgranted by the upper class, while others have to contend with huge obstacles to make those same opportunities happen for themselves).     Wish List  Some Philanthropic person sees my blog, feels my frustration, and offers me a chance to complete my education at their expense, but I will have to work it off somehow (see above for feelings on achievement without effort)  Oprah picks up on my blog, does a human interest story on me - the INS is embarrassed at their incompetence, rushes my application through and I get approved for Financial Aid.  This would be nice also in combination with the above.    I fuck off back to NZ and complete my degree there, even if I only ever make low budget NZ movies that gain only limited release here in the states.  (I will be a corporate whore to get me through film school, but I'd rather not be a whore to major studios as well).    I get struck by inspiration, write the next Good Will Hunting, get it made by  , get paid lots, win an oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and move with my cats to California to begin an illustrious career, first as a screen writer, and later as a director.  This option by passes the need for film school, and very likely the need to repay huge loans.  (and the need to seek constant treatment for the STDs I contract from whoring myself literally to repay said loans).    That I never forget the little people - even if I do 'make it'.    That I never forget how good it feels to have my cat sooty cuddling on my lap right now.    That I someday can look back on all of this, and say satisfactorily to my stylist and/or publicist that yes, it was all worth it.  :)   Things to do tomorrow:  *  Call  City Colleges to see if they have a summer semester - when it is, when I can register, etc.  If they do, and I can -  *  Call Columbia and ask them if I can cross credit Gen Ed classes still.  if yes -  woohoo.  If no -  *  Find a course I need to complete, and is at a good time for me, and enroll for summer semester.   *  Talk to UM about going to a part time shift (I need everyone's good vibes on this one) *  Scour the  urlLink Chicago Reader  for jobs.  *  Apply at will.    Anyone want to hire me?   - ooh ->  *  Post resume's on blog.    * Not get sick.  * Don't eat chocolate (bad easter pig out).   *sigh* Thats it for now, I think.

      Guys are wanks.   Why is it that they can be perfectly nice, damn near human even, when they are talking to you alone, but the minute a mate pops on to the scene, they have to degrade you, and make you feel like shit?   I can take a fucking joke, and I can fucking handle a lot of fucking shit.  I can take an insult better than almost any girl I know, and I can give better than I get.  But there is still a line you just don't fucking cross.  And someone crossed it.  I am so pissed off.  Pissed off enough that I had to go out and buy a new copy (i left my old one in NZ) of  urlLink  Live Through This   just so I could sing angrily along with the lyrics.    grr.  I'll get over it, but bleh.  It just makes me mad.

      i've been too busy to update this in the last couple of days, but I wanted to give a shout out to all those people searching google or yahoo for "laci peterson" + "no head" and coming up with this site.  rock on.    maybe laci will make me famous.  Or is that just a really crass thing to say?  anyway, are scott's parents in denial or what? Not that I can blame them for not wanting to consider that their darling son might be a psychopath.  I don't know what the situation with jails and everything is, but the papers are reporting that Scott has only been visited by  his lawyer since landing in jail a couple of days ago.  If I were his parents, whether or not I thought he was guilty, I'm sure I would have made a visit by now.  Maybe they just haven't been able to??   Anyway - to all you googlers - yes, Laci died with no head, according to all the reports I can find.  And I can't be bothered making a link, so google news it yourself.  And Yes, Laci apparently gave birth after she died - its a phenomenon called Coffin Birth, where the gas that builds up in a decomposing body forces out the foetus (hate it how americans spell it 'fetus').   Get all your latest news here, first! Either I'm really bored, or really morbid. ©.

      I guess the cops think they found  urlLink laci peterson's  body.  Although I'm by no means an expert, I think it was the husband.  Apparently he was fishing just two miles from where her body was found, on the day she disappeared.  Whoever was found, they are 'severely decomposed', there is a full term baby boy, with umbilical cord still attached, and in one account, the woman has no head. *shiver*.  Check out the latest I found on google news  urlLink here   I was really hoping for this case to be an elizabeth smart, and for laci to turn up, alive and well, if married to some crazy mormon nomad preacher.  *sigh*.  Even if it isn't laci and her son, obviously somebody went through some ugly, ugly moments.  Why can't we all just get along?

      My mother just accepted a job at a top International School in Bahrain (look it up!).  Here's what the CIA has to say about the place  urlLink bahrain .  I am excited as all hell.   Here is mum's recent email.  (Yeah, so what if I can't be bothered writing an entry myself today).     Dear Friends, Family and most of all my wonderful referees:   Finally the long-awaited job fair arrived and, thanks to my referees, I've had the most wonderful weekend.  You've done me proud.  In short, I've got THE JOB I wanted - and for a teaching job it would take some beating.  And so would my weekend.   I arrived to collect my package on Friday evening to find notes from 4 schools inviting me for interview - without me having lifted a finger!  I went home, listed all 15 English jobs and decided to try to interview for 9, having already eliminated the Mexico invitation because the pay was too low and I wasn't going to go just anywhere.   Saturday morning I lined up for my appointment time at the Turkish school which had invited me to do so, and found 4 possibilities eliminated immediately: by Turkish law they could not employ me, despite 24 years of English teaching, because it demands English majors for English teachers.  Down to 5 already and all granted me interviews.     Next the presentations from the schools.  A couple didn't impress me, but they were both in places of interest, so I decided to keep all appointments.   First interview: one of the top International Baccalaureat schools in the world - Copenhagen.  Had never thought of going there, but the school and location sounded wonderful and I was sure I could work with Michael.  I was asked what I REALLY wanted to do for work.  I said, I knew I'd never get what I really wanted but what I really wanted out of what was achievable was to be an IB English teacher.  "No, what do you ideally want?"   "Well, I developed a few little dodges (oops) to get out of full-time English teaching so I'd like to combine English with Reading or ESL or swap to Social Studies and Geography - something that would lighten the workload."   "Good, I'm glad you said that because if you had said life was wonderful being a full-time English teacher, I wouldn't have believed you."  He proceeded to tell me that three staff were at the job fair seeking other positions and if the English one got placed they would be offering me the job if I was interested.  In fact, they were so keen to employ me that they would even try to shuffle vacancies around to fit me in.  He said that my referees had shown me to be an outstanding candidate (he couldn't show me because it was confidential, so I still don't know!) and he was sorry he couldn't offer me a job right now.  However I shouldn't sell myself short.  Anything less than 100% desire on my part, walk away and start looking for jobs through other channels.  He would certainly be in touch as soon as he had anything to offer.  I left knowing I would be happy there.   Second interview: Oman.  Great package, but I felt they wanted their pound of flesh.     Sunday: arrived to find I had been shortlisted for Oman with a second appointment scheduled for the afternoon.  Had my interview with Bahrain and decided this was undoubtedly the job that I wanted.  Went away to lunch.  Returned to find a note asking me to go to the Bahrain interview room and got offered the job.  Accepted and cancelled the interview with the United Nations International School in NY and a school on the coast at Pattaya, Thailand.   And here's my package: tax free income with absolutely every expense except phone and food covered by the school.  This includes transport to and from work.  My apartment may be in a complex with pool and gym and it may have an ocean view.  It will be in a complex with some of their other single teachers who have a "jolly nice social life."    Prepared food of any nature is so cheap to have delivered that I need never cook again.     A lot of places in the Far East have far higher incomes, but this is certainly the cruisiest little number and I couldn't be happier.  Oh, and the best part: I'm an English / Social Studies teacher!  I will not be IB this year but that's definitely in the future.  The Bahrain Bayan School is the most highly regarded in Bahrain, so a candidate from another Bahraini school told me.  To check it out yourself go to www.bayanschool.edu.bh   And don't start worrying.  There has been no backlash of any nature against westerners there.  The only modification I need make to my lifestyle is to wear at least knee-length dresses and keep my shoulders covered.  Unless, of course I'm at one of the many clubs frequented by westerners.  If you're on private property you have the same freedom as home.   Not sharing the rest as it mentions names, etc.. but yeah.  I am very very excited.  I looked up airfares to go visit, they are hella expensive.  I'm looking at $1400-$1800 US for a round trip.  So.. any donations to the fund would be greatly appreciated.  Mum and I are planning to take a trip through Iraq to visit the site of Hanging Gardens of Babylon once I'm there (if you can actually visit the site).  yay!

      Mmm mmm.  I love's me some Ghetto.    I went to the aforementioned INS for fingerprints today, via the Broadway #36 bus.  The INS center I was assigned to go to is about 20 blocks north of where I live, in the neighbourhood I used to live in, Uptown.  The part of Uptown that I lived in, and that the INS center is situated, is not so bad, but some of the area you have to go through is pretty, well.. undesirable.    You first realise that you are entering this area when the boutique-y stores that are along broadway start turning into currency exchanges and pawn shops.  Then, all of those stores have bars across the windows.  Next, the group of people loitering in front of the school with the "No Loitering" sign.  This is what I was mentally chuckling at today, when I saw a thing I have only seen in movies before.  A drug deal going down.    So, one of said Loiteree's sees his mate across the road, and walks out to meet him.  The Mate walks into the road, and they shake hands and walk away from each other again.  I felt like I was in one of those movies where the cops are watching something on a security video, and they finally spot what they've been looking for, and the camera jumps in three times to magnify what it is they saw - thats what my vision did when I saw a bag of white powder being passed between the two men.    Well, it might be a non-event for a lot of people, but for me, a little immigrant cracka from NZ.. I sure as hell was impressed with myself.

      It's the strangest thing...   People are fucked.. I think.  I just got back from the gym, and on my way tumbled right into a scene from.. i don't know what.. maybe a South Park episode? I saw Jesus.  With his Cross.  No. Fucking. Shit.    Actually, I've seen Jesus around a few times lately.  The other day I saw him crossing Belmont Ave in front of our car, while we were stopped in gridlock.  I guess gridlock might equate to Hell, actually, I'm pretty sure it does.  Anyway, Jesus crossed in front of me with his little old wood-rotty cross, and then the light turned red and we drove on.    Today, I saw him again - crossing Belmont,  but closer to my apartment.  Maybe he lives around here? This guy is insane.  He has long flowy black hair (would you expect anything but?), and a black moustache beard thing, just like in pictures.  Well.. maybe thats just what I think he looks like, I'm kind of scared to look at him in case he singles me out anyway.  There are two possible outcomes of being singled out, as I see it, (Hell, or being Called) neither are good.  He wears a long flowing (again, Jesus and the flowing..) white robes, and a little crochet satchel, the type I would have bought years ago at  urlLink Trade Aid  in Picadilly Arcade. Jesus wear jeans - under his robes of course.    But the thing that really got me?  Jesus wears Nike's too.  Hell Yeah.

      I have to go back to the INS tomorrow, the world's most incompetent organisation.  I am not looking forward to it at all.  Once again, they're asking for my fingerprints.  I've already given my fingerprints - about a year and a half ago, but apparently fingerprints 'expire'.  Yeah, like my fingerprints change.  Oh, I forgot that I'm a crazy murderer who constantly cuts up my own fingers to change the prints.  Good thing the INS is on to me and making me go through a dehumanising process *again*.  I might start feeling like an intelligent life form if they leave me alone for too long, and we wouldn't want that happening.

      You know what I said about hating winter?  Well, today is one of the rare days when I don't, when I actually almost enjoy it.    We had a heavy snowfall a couple of days ago (see 4/7 post), which came as somewhat of a surprise, as our weather until that point had been relatively balmy for a month or so prior.  Now, the snow that covered the trees and the grass semi-melted, then refroze into gorgeous icicle's covering everything.  I normally hate getting up at 5.30am (what don't I hate?), but today, just as we were getting to work, the sunrise was shining through the tops of the trees and illuminating the icicle's with a warm, orange backlight.  It was absolutely gorgeous.. It's like seeing a million trees made of glass, with a million branches on each tree.  The empty field across the way even looked gorgeous.. the longer stalks of grass were also transformed into glittery glass.  I wish I had a camera with me.    I guess it's back to the grind now though.. 7am, and calls will start coming through any second and disturb me.  I hate people.  Add that to my list.  My infamous quote is:  Stupidity is Widespread Among the General Populace  TM  (props to  urlLink exxie  for that bit of html genius) .  This proves to be more and more true every day.    Soon to come:  Tales of stupidity from the Call Center from Hell.   Here's a teaser: I spoke to a lady who couldn't remember her password, so I told her I was resetting it for her.  She just laughed and said, "why you sayin' that?" (imagine a southern, crazy old lady voice) "Saying what?" I replied, perplexed.  "Password".  "Because you need to reset yours."  "Hehe, it's Password, not password" she giggled.   By this time I knew I was talking to a crazy woman.   "It's Password, not Password", she continued - "Why you keep saying Password? It's Password!".   Frustrated, I tried to end the call - "You'll receive the Password in -" "How'd you  spell that?" crazy woman interrupted? "P-a-s-s-w-o-r-d.  Is there anything else I can help you with?" "It's password, not password!"  I could tell this was going to go round in circles.   You know, I do have an accent, and I do talk to dumbasses a lot, but this would have to be one of the only times a woman insisted I was saying a word wrong.  I'm sorry I don't talk like a dumbass hick yank, Ms. crazy-woman-from-virginia. grrr.    I hate my job, too.

      I still haven't recovered from the change in time.  I had to take a two hour nap today to catch up on missed sleep.  I still feel like a friggin freight train crashed in my skull, but that could be from a lot of things, including a banal, inane existence and mind-numbing work.   routine, I have decided, is the devil's own tool.  Get up at 5.30, leave for work at 6, start work at 7, leave at 3.30, get home at 5pm, go to gym, repeat.  i need out.

      8:00 am in the morning.. but it's really 7:00am.. damn daylight savings.  I feel like it's still 6:00am, but - well, I never was a morning person.   We're in the grips of a winter storm fit for early February, not early April.  Have I mentioned that I hate winter?  Well, just in case you missed that, I hate winter.  The roads are terrible.  I was 40 minutes late for work today.  We passed several accidents, one of which really brought home a sense of mortality.  A car and a van, completely spun out.  One wheel lying about 30 feet away from either vehicle.. the back seat of the van lying in the middle of the road.  The flashing lights of emergency vehicles were the only colour against the white and grey background.  It's like living in monochrome when it snows.  Anyway, all three of us in the car were just kind of silent driving past that.  It might be trite and somewhat cliche, but I just thought, there, but the grace of god, go I.    I just hope that it wasn't as bad as it looked, what with the doors ripped off by the EMTs and everything. I hope that there isn't some family out there that lost a mother, or a father today.

      So.. does anybody else in the world sit on icq and talk to their ex boyfriend, 12000 miles away, for several hours?  Oh.. should I mention that said ex is my ex of five years?   is that weird? my present boyfriend seems to think so..

      Oh yeah.. fiddy years ago today (that's 50 for the uninitiated) a man from a wee country called New Zealand, along with his mate, from a wee country called Nepal, climbed Mt. Everest.    The NY Times is lovely and has historical issues on the web.   urlLink Here  is the one from that day in 1953 when the acheivement was announced.  You might have to sign up to view the article.    This is a nice  urlLink article  from the NY Times yesterday, on Sir Edmund and his work to help the Nepalese people etc. Though, it seems from this  urlLink article  written by Sherpa Tenzing's grandson, also in the NY Times, that there have been downsides to the modernization that came with the achievement.  I guess it happens everywhere.  *sigh*  Wonder if they had some number 8 wire up there?

      I'm so mad at  urlLink Jeep .  The Nerve.    They currently run this one ad on the radio, about the world's longest place name.  The world's longest place name is apparently a Maori name in New Zealand.  Not only does the stupid ad guy horribly torture and mispronounce what is actually a poetic sounding language.. he says "That's Maori (pronounced by him as "Maowree") Indian for... "  "Maori Indian"? What. The. Fuck?  Can somebody please slap the Jeep advertising execs upside their heads?    My suggestions:  Get a native Maori speaker to pronounce the world's longest name (Something about Rangi laying down his spear... but the announcer pronounced Rangi like you would pronounce Ringo as in Ringo Starr.. *ugh*).    Second of all.. and I know that most yanks are dumb and can't understand the concept of an indiginous people that aren't called Indians, and most yanks probably haven't even heard of New Zealand, let alone Maori culture (and - to my American friends - I exclude you from the yank calling), but... there's no need to call them Maori Indians.  They are not Maori Indians.  Perhaps, if clarification is needed.. Maori Polynesians sounds a little less patronising to me.    Ugh. Can you believe it?

      Ooohhhh.. my.... stomach... hurts....   Its nearly 5am on a Saturday morning.. and I am blogging.  No.. I'm not stumbling home, drunk, after a fantastic night of drinking, loud music, and hot boys vying for my attention (though that is my regular routine. No, really).    I have  urlLink dysmenorrhea .  No, that's not some weird form of the runs.  It's a/k/a menstrual cramps.  Oh, sorry boys, I can just hear you cringing and groaning.  Why'd I have to mention the 'M' word?    Well, tough shit.  I'm in pain, and you're going to deal with a stupid word.  No.. I don't have PMS at all.  My cramps get so bad my doctor prescriped Celebrex for me.  Celebrex is arthritis medicine.    Anyway, my body is lovely enough to consistently start to hurt in the middle of the night.  Every fucking month, like clockwork.  This generally means I get woken up by stomach pains at 2 or 3 in the morning.  I have to make several trips to the bathroom, take copious amounts of drugs, then sit and hope against hope that the painkillers kick in.  I should just smoke some pot or something.. it helps glaucoma patients, why not me? It'd take effect  more quickly than my stupid drugs do, anyway.  Once I've woken up with cramps, there's no falling back asleep till they go away.  If I lie down and try to sleep, all I can do is think about how much my cramps hurt, which ironically makes it hurt more.  If I get up and do stuff, I don't focus on the pain so much, and it goes away eventually.  This is what I'm doing now.. hoping that soon, I will forget the pain entirely, and be able to go back to bed, or I will get so tired that I will fall asleep no matter what tricks my stomach pulls on me.   I hate cramps!

      Carrying on the insanity..    "Prisoners are being subjected to 'Enter Sandman' from Metallica's self titled 1991 album, Drowning Pool's 'Bodies' from the film 'XXX,' and possibly the most fearsome of the lot - Barney The Dinosaur,"   urlLink NME  reports on US interrogation techniques.  A Sergeant in the US Army said,  "[The prisoners] can't take [Heavy Metal]. If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken."   Bwhahaha!  Find the full report  urlLink here   Last night, at the gym, I picked up a copy of Red Eye, the first time I have done so since it was released late last year.  The reason?  Jessica Lynch was on the cover - apparently it was a case of Wag the Dog.  I really didn't pay much attention to the Lynch story when it was happening, because I could tell the media was making her into a poster child for the war.  I knew that most likely a lot of the details were hyperbole, but even cynical old me didn't think the government would out right fabricate.  I mean, do they not think anyone has seen Wag the Dog? Anyway, my new favourite LA Times columnist  urlLink Robert Scheer  wrote about the whole shenanigan in his  urlLink latest column .  It's interesting reading at least.    More and more each day, I feel like I live in an Orwellian dystopia.  There are stickers on the newspaper dispensers on my way back from the red line, that read "War is Peace" on them.  America is so adept at doublethink.  I'm glad there are people who are aware of it out there.  I really try to not take the government BS line, but I am in a precarious position, at the mercy of the INS at present.  I don't want to anger any body or face losing my residency.  Although, not having to live in this country would not faze (sp?) me much, I would have to leave Andy and the life we have built.  It makes me mad that I indirectly support American foreign policy and bullying by merely existing int his country and paying taxes to a government I believe is corrupt and ineffective.    I have a whole war and politics rant sketched out in my head for future blogging.  It will have to remain unsaid at present though, as going through that and presenting my millieu of random thoughts and feelings on the subject in a comprehensible manner is going to be quite a feat.   And just because  urlLink Andy  ribbed me for crying last night about the end of  urlLink Buffy , and not mentioning it in my blog.. I want to just say to Joss Whedon - I love you.  You truly created a strong feminist character for our generation.  Thank you.  There is so much I love about Buffy, and so much that I'm sad to see go.  However, instead of trying to be eloquent myself, I will direct you instead to some links of people who actually get paid to write about this stuff.    urlLink NY Times   urlLink Chicago Tribune   and my favourite  urlLink Los Angeles Times   urlLink Zap2it 's tribute to Buffy.

      From Sex to Politics in one day..   I guess the US government is considering a new Defense bill that would resume nuclear testing, and approve development for new nuclear (sorry.. nukular) technology that is handheld, thus making it far more frighteningly available to terrorists.  Is the Bush administration THAT stupid?  I keep telling myself that the men and women in power of this country are governed by the basic tenets of common sense that most people have, but I guess not.  I also guess that ascribing basic tenets of common sense to the vast majority of this country is a gross exaggeration in which I give far too much credit to far too many people.  There is a really interesting column on this in the  urlLink LA Times .  It's good to see that some of the American media still has its wits about it.    I made a call to the Illinois Senator to register my opposition to the passing of this bill.  The staffer told me they'd received a lot of calls on it.  If you're in the states, I'd urge you to call your local senator too.    urlLink Moveon.Org  is a good site to get involved with activism at grass roots in the states.  Unless you're a Bush-ite, then I guess just head over to your local old boys club and scarf down a whiskey over intellectual debate on nukular weapons.  Don't "misunderestimate" them.  From politics to ... er.. insanity..?? Check out  urlLink Buckethead .  Rock On. I think he's GnR's new answer to Slash.. but I really have no idea.

       TV, Meteors and Sex - a lot of it.   Spent the whole day painting our living room two shades of blue.  The last tenants left it a strange shade of radioactive putrid spew yellow.  We also watched a lot of tv, now that the cable guy installed cable for us yesterday.  I Love Seth Green.    Anyway, thanks to  urlLink Tam I Am 's blog, I found this site to  urlLink register  your name on a cd being sent to crash into a comet.  Pointless? Yes.  Did I do it anyway?  urlLink You betcha .    Further pointless knowledge about me.  I have what I like to call the "Drop Everything and Fuck" list.  This list comprises of people (celebrities only, it breaks the rules if it's a normal person) that no matter what I am doing, if I got the chance, I would have to fuck.  These people are known to  urlLink Andy  (and he has his list too), so that if I actually ever do get the chance, it's not considered cheating.  Anyway, further to this list, I have an "Ashamed to admit it, but yeah, I'd do them till it hurt, and then some more" list.  I came to a realisation today, while watching the 2002 VMA's on MTV.  This realisation hurt me, deeply.  Sort of like how it must feel for an alcoholic to come to the realisation that they are, in fact, alcoholic.  Well, not really... but sort of.  My realisation was that - Justin Timberlake is HOT.  I want to Rock his body.  Thus, his addition to my Ashamed list is hereby cemented.  Please don't judge me, I'm suffering punishment enough.    Top 5 on my "Drop Everything and Fuck List" (in no particular order and I reserve the right to change this list at any time):   urlLink Dave Grohl  (mm. mm. I loves me a man with tattoos).   urlLink Keanu Reeves    urlLink Alyson Hannigan   urlLink Bruce Willis   urlLink Spike  (from Buffy - not James Marsters, just Spike).   In my Top 20 we include such names as:   urlLink Robbie Williams  (the tats and the attitude get me every time)  urlLink Seth Green   urlLink Kevin Spacey   urlLink Justin Timberlake (bleh.. *cough*)  urlLink Eminem   Anyway, enough of me and my indulgences.   Game of the moment: Who would you do if they were the last two people on earth and you had to fuck one of them because a gun was being held to your head, etc etc (no way out).   This game has been known to stretch the imagination (on long road trips) to such crazy choices as : "What would you rather do - that lamp post, or that street sign?".    Other great stumpers have been "Hitler or Saddam Hussein?" and "Christina Aguilera or Britney?" (Christina - cuz at least she knows she's a ho).   We talk about sex a lot.

      Well.. I saw  urlLink The Matrix  last night.  *sigh* I had such high hopes.   I don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it, so lets just say.. not too happy with it at all.  I would still say go and see it, but only because it's the Matrix, and you wanna know what everyone's talking about, don't you?

      continued from post below...   urlLink movies  last night.  Incidentally it was the one he won the award for.  It was in romanian and he fast forwarded to all the bits he was in, but it was a bit of a laugh to say the least.  He gets beheaded in the movie.  Poor Val  (sorry about the weird posting - I messed up the tags on this before, and couldn't edit it.  grr. I was so funny and witty in it, too. )  So, apparently.. I'm mostly liberal quaker, very closely followed by Unitarian Universalist and Neo-Pagan.  hunh. who'da thunk it? I least closely match the beliefs of Jehovah Witnesses.  Anyway, you can see my results -  urlLink here  - or, run your own quiz -  urlLink here .    Here are the links to the breakdowns of my top three matches.    urlLink Liberal Quakers  100%  urlLink Unitarian Universalist   96%  urlLink Neo-Pagan  94%  *shudder*.  I even match  urlLink scientology  by 54%.    Here's the info on my bottom three matches.     urlLink Eastern Orthodox  20%  urlLink Roman Catholic  20%  urlLink Jehovah's Witness  18% (how'd I get even that much?)

      I'm going to see The Matrix Reloaded tonight - I'm completely spoiler free, so don't tell me ANYTHING about the plot.  Stupid  urlLink Andy  read a review of it yesterday, and spoiled himself for it.  Then my stupid class last night at Columbia was talking about it.  I put my hands over my ears and went "la la la la".  They just ignored me as the crazy kiwi girl, like they usually do.    Speaking of my class last night, my teacher  urlLink Val , is a former Romanian actor (who won the Romanian equivalent of Best Supporting Actor) showed us one of his  urlLink movies  last night.  Incidentally, it was the one he won the award for.  It was in Romanian, and he fast forwarded to all the bits he was in, but it was a bit of a laugh, to say the least.  He gets beheaded in the movie.  Poor Val.   edited to add = yay for safe mode! I finally corrected the HTML in this post, so that it actually looks like a post.

      I can not believe I actually just sat through  most of the series finale to Dawsons Creek.  I haven't hardly watched the show since the first season when it was on on Friday nights (in NZ) and we used to watch it while getting drunk before we would go out... Anyhoo..   It ended.  I was somewhat sad when whatsername (the chubby blonde one - Jen) died, but only because the writers played every damned cliche there is to make us cry.  The video to her daughter? Puh-leeze.  But the Joey/Pacey/Dawson love triangle? ugh, gimme a break.  Joey is SO nothing to write home about.  Whining, selfish bitch.  (You can tell I'm not into this show at all, right?)   I definitely like Pacey better than fuckturd Dawson, but -- Joey is no catch herself, so I wanted her to choose Dawson.  This way, two people I hate end up together, and Pacey, who deserves way better, gets to move on with his life.  This was not to be so.  The writers felt they wanted to be 'original' or something, and made Slutface Joey pick Pacey.  Poor Pacey.   Fuck, I can't believe I'm spending precious blog space on this steaming turd of a show.   What I really have me knickers in a twist over is Buffy - can't really say much about it right now, as I have Buffy watching friends in NZ who read this blog (occasionally) and I don't want to spoil them for it.  Can I just say "Damn" though? Damn Buffy has pretty hair.  Damn Faith is hot.  Damn I am in love with Willow.  Damn Andrew is funny.  Damn, I'm sad about Xander's eye.  Ok, so I'll stop there before I give away every plot twist.    This is probably one of the only times you'll read me blogging about TV.   Be thankful.   Other developments in the life of moi - put it this way - boys are way too damn confusing.  Con-Fucking-Fusing. I now plead the fifth (I'm not american, so I hope thats the one where I don't say anything else to avoid  incriminating myself).   Anyway.. tra la la.. my cat is talking to me. He says "meh meh".

      Sometimes, just sometimes, I actually have a good enough time in Chicago, that the general crappiness of here fades away.    Saturday night, I went out with Andy.  So we walk out of the apartment at 11ish, expecting the same chilliness that had been in the air all day, but are buffeted by a wall of humidity.  Thunderstorms in the midwest are just amazing.  For 360 degrees around us, there was nothing but constant lightning, and huge booming thunder.  I loved it.  It started pissing down, so we hailed a cab, and then hung out in the doorway of  urlLink the clubhouse  record store for 15 or 20 minutes, just watching the lightening and listening to the thunder setting off the car alarms.  :)   We finally tore our eyes away from the lightening, and headed into the caverns of  the  urlLink Metro/Smartbar .  I was happy to find that one of my favourite local house DJs,  urlLink DJ Collette , was spinning. House specials were Finlandia & Red Bull (mmmm.. alcoholicious) for $6.  A few of those later, and the bassline was really up my spine.  I have no idea where Andy went, but some guy with his cap backwards was trying to put the moves on me.  The moment he put his arms around me, Andy was magically there tapping the guy on the shoulder - "dude, thats my girlfriend you're dancing with".  Never saw the guy again. hehe.   Can I just say - McDonalds? Nothing tastes better at 4am in the morning, especially when you're too drunk to have working tastebuds.

      *pours some out for her dead homies* RIP..   Well, ok, so no one died, but my friend  urlLink Dan  just got fired from here.  Grr.. *shakes her fist at the Corporate Pimp, aka Dale Gifford, dissing his ho's*  I'm really going to miss Dan, but we have sworn to keep in touch.  I know, everyone says that they'll keep in touch, but Dan and I already hang out, outsideof work, so I really hope we don't lose touch.    Dan.. this one's for you..    "NICKLEBAAAAAAAAAACK"  (it's an inside joke)  Dan, I just want you to know...  I believe the children are the future,  Teach them well, and let them lead the way.  Show them all the beauty they posses inside.  Give them a sense of pride.  To make it easier.  Let the children's laughter, remind us, of how we used to be.   (also an inside joke.. believe me)  (last conversation taken out - it was too fucken long to read through).

       The Move From Hell   Moving isn't good at the best of times, but at the worst.. its hellish.  Actually, it's Hellish.  It definitely deserves that capitalisation there.    So, we just got through moving (obviously).  We decided to move to a two bedroom apartment, and my friend  urlLink exxie p  moved into the other bedroom, thus lowering all of our rent.  We are now a lovely cohabitational unit of three plus cats.  We love our building and our area, so the ideal was to move to a two bedroom in the same building.. which we achieved.  We paid our security deposit and first month's rent back in March.   We  were organised.  Wish I could say that about the previous tenants.   About a week before we were set to move, we were all packed and ready to pounce the moment said ex-tenants left the building.  Their apartment was empty except for a few peices of crap left lying around, so we fully expected to be in posession of the apartment a day or two before we had to be out of ours.  But no!.. my faith in people's innate goodness was about to take a hearty blow.    Imagine the black billowing rain clouds forming over the lake.  Imagine yourself, totally engrossed in Angel having his ass kicked by ugly Jasmine, and a knock - a sort of timid tapping - on your back door.  Grumbling that the disturbance didn't happen in an ad break, and clambering over the many boxes, I open the door.  It's Tom the building foreman.    "The other tenants will be out of the apartment in around 15 minutes.   The keys will be on the counter, and the door will be open." (What?! They wait this long to move, and now they can't even wait until the end of Angel tonight?!) "OK, Thanks" I say, "I'll move a couple things in tonight then".   "Well, ahh.. actually.. " Tom scratches his head, and curls his lips up over his patchy-toothed gum, "You better move as much as you can, because the new tenants are moving in here tomorrow and you'll get fined if you're still in here".   Fine. Fucking Fine.  We've been waiting for a week for asshole over the courtyard to move their stupid  bags of crap, and now suddenly I have to move all at once or be fined? Shit.  Not to mention that I have to clean the place or face serious diminishment (sp?) of our security deposit.   Tom walks off mentioning something about a 14 hour day.  The first flash of lightening lights the darkening sky in the distance.    9pm, still reeling from gasp! Lilah's return on Angel (what? huh?!), I begin the trek down two flights of stairs across the courtyard, and up one flight to the new apt.  One box down, about 80 to go.  In the beginning I'm full of energy.  Two flights of stairs? No problem, I'll take 'em two at a time, running, jumping, skipping! La de da! Andy gets home from school at 10 and starts chipping in.  Soon, the first spits of rain plop down.  Five seconds later I can't see two feet in front of me for the rain.  Oh yeah, and the thunder and lightening.  Great.    What's really fantastic, is the really heavy furniture we have to move.  In the rain.  On our own.  With my weak muscles.  Two redbulls down, I decide I need Pizza.  Andy heads over to Walgreens to buy a frozen one.  Third redbull and half a pizza down, we decide to tackle some of the really heavy stuff.  3am and we finally hit the sack... or the really uncomfortable futon mattress on the floor.  We are so wired from all the Red Bull (not to mention my biceps that are aching in complaint of being rudely awakened into use) that neither of us sleep for more than a couple of hours.   8.30am a mere twelve hours after Tom so rudely interrupted Angel, and we are up again, eating a muffin from Intelligentsia, and moving some more of the heavy stuff.  I get into the scrubbing of the bathroom and the kitchen, but Tom the building guy relieves me with a small mercy - a cleaning crew, at no cost to me.     urlLink Exxie  turns up with her friend Nick, in a U-Haul at 11 - they have to get it back by 1pm.  That bit's ok.. we scramble around to unload everything, but with 4 people instead of 2, everything goes much more quickly.  We drop Nick off on the South side to attend classes and then make a very, very slow trip to the Northwest Side to clean out the rest of her apartment.  It wasn't as bad as ours, but remember - I'd been up more than 24 hours straight, with a couple hours of sleep in between.  I was also feeling for the first time, muscles I don't think even knew they existed, let alone me knowing that.  Quadriceps, meet Burning Excruciating Pain.  You'll be buddy's for the next three days so get to know each other well.  Biceps and Tender Sore Bruises? Same goes for you two.    grr. arrgh.

      Attended the  urlLink Chicago Gay Pride Parade   yesterday.  It runs just near our apt, so  urlLink Exxie  and I took chairs out, and snacks, and watched the revellers go by.    Last year, I got really drunk outside the 7-11 on Halsted afterwards, and much merriment ensued.. too much to relate publicly on the internet, thats for sure.  Yes.. nudity was involved.    This year, I was hung over from the night before, so after sitting for fucking ever in the sun.. we finally got enough motivation to walk three blocks home to nap.    I took plenty of pics, and seeing as I can't find any from the Chicago Parade online, I will post mine as soon as I devlop the film and scan the pics.. which could be a total of 2.6532 years.  approximately.    Oh yeah.. and  urlLink Portia de rossi married her girlfriend .  Who knew she was a lesbian? Oh well.  time to get back to work. (if i can figure out how i'm supposed to publish with this new blogger shite)

       Ground on Down   Friday night, I finally got to see  urlLink Ben Harper  at  urlLink Summerfest  in Milwaukee.  I say finally, because I have missed out on seeing him at least three previous times.  The first was in late 1997 or early 1998, and i didn't buy a ticket in favour of seeing radiohead, but then I didn't end up seeing radiohead instead (still haven't).   Second time, I'd just moved back to  urlLink Wellies  in 2000, and needed to go home to  urlLink Mount Maunganui  to pick up some stuff, and it was the same weekend of the concert.    Third time was at Summerfest also, Andy was so sure we wouldn't need to buy advance tickets, but it was sold out when we got there, funnily enough.   Anyway, fourth time was a charm for me, and it was sooo amazing. I have loved Ben Harper since I first heard  Faded , some time in 96 or 97.  I then bought two of his earlier albums,   Fight for Your Mind  and  Welcome to the Cruel World .  Anyway, suffice to say I've been a big fan for a long time.  So, to see Ben live, finally, was worth getting rained on twice, shivering, putting up with 15 year old girls smoking cigarettes (without even fucking inhaling) next to us, and all the general shit that we went through to finally hear him.  As soon as he came on stage, I warmed up.   The Innocent Criminals were a big part of the gig too, which was really great.. he has an awesome band.  Ben cuts it up on the slide guitar too.  I was just amazed.   They played one of my personal faves, Ground on Down (I've wanted to hear him do this song live ever since I heard the  Tibetan Freedom Concert  cd in 1998, with a version of it on there) followed up by Burn One Down - you could smell the air get heavy with pot smoke right then and there.  awww yeah.   There were three encore's, one song  urlLink Jack Johnson  came back on stage to sing with Ben.  For the last song, Ben did Faded, and went into a cover of A whole lotta love - sounds crazy, but it was so amazing.  Words can not describe how great it was.  Plus, I've had about two hours sleep since last night, and i'm still slightly drunk at nearly 6am in the morning (hence my excuse for a not very cohesive post.. )    With that, I'ma head off to bed.. again..     urlLink     Ben & girlf (& mother of his baby) Laura Dern (not jealous, not jealous.. )

      Motherfuck, it's Hot here. (herre) Don't worry, i'm keeping my clothes on.   I find so much stuff on  urlLink Tamiam's  blog that I am finally going to get off my lazy arse and update her into my permanent bloggy link section.  Because I'm sure her readership will increase tenfold once that happens.  blah.  Anyway, I didn't even know that  urlLink New Zealand  was considering this, but apparently they've just passed a  urlLink prostitution reform bill  which decriminalises prostitution and allows for greater protection of the 'sex workers'.  I think its about bloody time the powers that be recognise that no matter how illegal you make whoring yourself or others, it will happen, and that those people need to have rights and protections.  Not only that, but innocent wife-y at home needs to have protection that when her beloved hubby 'stays late at the office', he's not going to bring home  urlLink ghonorrhea .    Yeah, so yay for NZ.  If you click on the link above too, you'll see a pic of  urlLink Georgina Beyer  one of the Politicians that presented the Bill to parliament.  Take close note.   urlLink Georgina  used to be George.  But I say, Good on her.  I am really proud of NZ sometimes, for the fact that we can have a transsexual in parliament, and its not the issue, its the work they do that matters.  In the states, everything is so tied up to getting re-elected again, and politics, and pleasing the fucking  urlLink moral majority  that people like that are so fucking sidelined.    There was recently an election here in Chicago for all the city positions, like Aldermans and the Mayor etc.  Alderman's are basically like City Council members who represent a certain area of the city.  Well, I live right in Boystown, you would think that a gay man standing for Alderman in Boystown would not be a big deal here, but yet it was all over the news about the first Gay man to be elected an alderman and shit.  My only question is, why didn't this happen sooner?   In fact, I think a lot of American politico's - and a fuck load of yanks too - could learn a lot from Georgina Beyer.  I was googling info on her to link to, and I found out that only just on June 20, this year, PBS has released a documentary on Georgina, to be shown here nationally.  I checked my listings, and it's not scheduled to be on this month, but hopefully in the next month or so.  Anyway, it's really bloody interesting.       urlLink   P.O.V.: You've been complimented by the New Zealand Listener for being "a walking advertisement for transparency." Now that your life story will be shown on national television in the States, is there any advice you would like to share with politicians here?     Beyer:  My goodness, me. I had not heard that quote. I don't know whether to be offended or complimented by it.    P.O.V.: I think it was a compliment.     Beyer:  Yes, yes. The reality is, and this is only commonsense, really, is that I have had an unusual life. A misfit, one might think. If I were not a transsexual, anything I might have done would not be considered particularly remarkable. But I am a transsexual, [and] proud of it to the hilt, because that is what I am. In order to stand for public office, given my history, I want to do it from a clean slate. People want to know just who the hell they are considering to put into a position of responsibility. That's only fair. And it relieves me of a whole lot of unscrupulous media that wanted to uncover scandal after scandal as they delved into my past. I put it out there before them. And of course I knew that it was all true. And people are satisfied with that. They seem to want to support an underdog who's a good, true, honest person, with a certain amount of cheekiness about them. I guess I just slipped into the belief that people have a right to know who it is that they are electing. So my suggestion is that if you've got any skeletons in the closet, you can save yourself an awful lot of grief if you lay it all on the table before you enter into the world of politics.     Anyway.  I should be getting off my arse and going to the gym.

       Of INS and Pearl Jam..   First things furst.. I am now a legal permanent resident of the  urlLink United States of America .  Yep.  So I'm going to write the rest of this post in my American accent.    Sho' was an anti (pronounced ant-tie, not ant-ee) climactic experience.  yessiree.  We did done get the state id's from them nice people at the Deepartment of Motor Ve urlLink Hick les, and the taxes from them bastards at the IRS, and made it to the INS in time to wait 'n wait 'n wait for our appointment.    I finally got to talk to the INS officer 'n he jus' flipped through my paperwork 'n approved me on the spot.  Argh. I can't type in an American accent anymore.  Plus, it doesn't sound anything like most people around  urlLink here .    Suffice to say that I got my permanent residency.  Now I'm going to run off with my secret  urlLink lover  (hee hee).  Yeah, so on Saturday,  urlLink Andy  and I spent a night in hippie heaven.  Unfortunately it was pretty damn crappy for us.  We went to a Pearl Jam concert.  Don't ask me why we bought tickets, because we really have no good answers, considering that neither of us particularly like Pearl Jam.  We just figured.. summer outside concert - yeah!   Highlights of the evening: Seeing the  urlLink Buzzcocks .  Seeing this one guy wearing a t-shirt that said in big letters  urlLink "Bogan" .  For my US readers (heh, like anyone reads this shite), more information on  urlLink Bogans  can be found  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and (best of all) urlLink here .   Ok, so I said more about Bogans than about the Pearl Jam concert, but that about says what I thought of it and the people attending.  For such a rich band, couldn't they do more than shine some stupid fucking lights on a backboard for display?

      argh.. it's  urlLink that  time of the month again.  grr.    Tomorrow I have my final interview with the INS for immigration to the states.  grr.. At least when if I get approved I can finally divorce Andy (*KIDDING* Mr. INS man).    The paralegal at the lawyer's office just spent a half hour going mental at me because I don't have a State ID (it said valid driver's license - wtf would I need a State ID for?).. so tomorrow morning I have to start my day out the only way that is worse than starting it off with the INS.. at the DMV trying to get a state fucking ID.   wish me luck. (i'll bloody well need it).

      I quit Fly Me To The Moon.. Yeah.. it pretty much sucked.  Part of it was that they were so unhygenic.. (Is it mean of me to wish that the health department reads this?).. Yeah, so on Wednesday night, I poured these two Swiss chicks a glass of  urlLink Parducci Pinot Noir wine each.   They didn't like it, and said it should taste like a Bordeaux (say wha??), so I poured them a glass of their next choice, a Cab Sav.  So, after the girls left (I couldn't throw the drink away in front of them, and the sink was blocked anyway)... I was going to throw it away seeing as the girls had already drunk from the glasses, and they'd finished the bottle, so I had thrown the bottle in the very nasty bin.. but the owner, Greg, told me no.. get the bottle out of the bin and pour the wine back in.  Let us just take a moment there, he is telling me to get an empty bottle out of a rubbish bin and pour wine that has been drunken from, back into it.  E. WW.   It wasn't just that though.. Greg put bread that had been half eaten back into the bread bin for others to potentially eat.. I think this is illegal.    Also, he hired me on for no base pay, just tips.  Working for tips only is fine when the place you work for is actually fucking BUSY.  When it is not busy, and you make several drinks for the waiter to give to his tables, and he doesn't tip you out, then it is a waste of fucking time.   Plus, I got leered at.  ew.  The kitchen was downstairs, and the chef was walking up the stairs behind me, and made some comment about me getting a 'real cute figure from walking up and down the stairs'.. I shuddered but stayed quiet, and he followed it up like a quick one, two with "but you already  have a real cute figure..".  E. WWW.  *blerchchchchchhchchchchch*.  Bring me a bowl, I need to CHUNDER.   This would be scary even if the said chef did look like Dave Grohl (H.O. T. ), but alas, it's even grosser because the guy looks like an italian Cletus.  Like I said before.  E. YEWWWWWWWWWWWW..   Anyway... I quit.  Thank Fuck.    So now I gots to get back on my feet and find another fucking job.  I *hope* I get this one job I applied for today at a new bar thats opening on Halsted in a week or two.. cross fucking fingers for me..   oh yeah.. my word to the wise for the night.   Never, EVER, Never see a movie called "Ghost Ship" (not my choice of video tonight - I'm never lettiing  urlLink andy  pick a video again.  Anyway.  Just don't see it.  Just don't.   That is all.

      So.. I didn't get to see  urlLink Whale Rider  last night.  I was pissed, too, because they were having a pre-screening workshop with Keisha Castle Hughes, and Rawiri Paratene.  Being the film buff and as interested in the film-making process that I am, I was really amped to go see them.. also, to be about the only other person in the room who could actually pronounce Rawiri Paratene's name. heh heh.    But - that bartending gig I've got at Fly me to the moon? Yeah, well.. they needed me to work.. I mean, c'mon, I don't think they could have handled the whole FOUR customers they had in six hours without me.  Good job I was there.    sheeit.    Anyway, I called up Facets and begged them to tell me if Whale Rider was going to have a wider release, considering the massive reviews its getting and everything (sidebar:  On the elliptical trainer the other night at the gym, I was reading Entertainment Weekly or US mag or some such rag.. and Whale Rider was critics pick of the week.. you know you've made it when a mainstream mag like that touts you).. The snooty guy on the phone finally asked for me, and then came back and told me it was starting a run on June 20th at  urlLink Landmark Century , which, happily, is about five mins walk from my  urlLink whare , and a pretty great theatre.    So.. though I didn't get to hang with my pseudo- urlLink whanau  (in the sense that we're all kiwi's), I will still get to drag along all my friends there, and prolly cry buckets at seeing the East Coast again (no, not New England - the East Coast of Aotearoa, New Zealand).   I also just want to say - amazon.com links are a bugger, and messed up all sorts of crap that I have only just got right, so do me a favour and fucking click on it and buy something from amazon, now that I've gone to all that trouble.

      I haven't seen Whale Rider yet, but I am going to do my damndest to get to the whole ONE stupid showing of the film in the ENTIRE greater Chicago area, this Wednesday @ 7pm.  (Thanks  urlLink Facets  for showing it).    Anyway.. here's some  urlLink "buzz"  about the movie, along with links to major positive and negative reviews.  I was glad to see that there was as little as only one negative review, by the Village Voice.  (I'm not linking to them for the pure fact that they were negative - besides, you can follow the link from the page above if you really want to read what they had to say).  I think the reviewers negativity just illustrates his ignorance of New Zealand and Maori Culture.  You might think different. Comment if you do, I guess.   So.. I went to the bartending trial thingy last night.  It was bloody boring and slow.  It's a restaurant called  urlLink Fly me to the Moon  in  urlLink Wrigleyville  (blending into my  urlLink Lakeview  'hood).  So, last night, the  urlLink Yankees  were back at  urlLink Wrigley Field  to play the  urlLink Cubs  for the first time since like 1935.  It was a big deal.  (Cubs won.. by a hair that stunned even a vehement non-fan like myself).  So, apart from the rain keeping everyone in doors, there was a historical game going on down the road at the ole  urlLink Addison & Clark  intersection, keeping all the would-be diners and drinkers confined to either their TV sets, or the ballpark.  Great.    I did make two drinks - a Vodka & Tonic, and a Rum 'n Coke.  Well.. I actually made a Rum 'n Cranberry by accident, and didn't realise until later on when I came to pour myself a coke by pressing the red "C" on the soda gun, and getting Cranberry instead.  The guy didn't say anything, and still tipped me nicely.. It must be my winning smile.   Anyway.  I'm going back to waitress tonight.. I hope I actually make some money tonight. grr.

      *pouts*   urlLink Exxie  just stumped me, and she wont tell me the answer.    Why is a raven like a writing desk?    Uhm.. well, not too sure, but apparently in some way they are alike.  Also, apparently it took Exxie about ten years (of not constantly thinking about it) to figure it out.    Well, poo.. I don't know what it is.  I don't want to figure it out, I want to know now! Or i'll have a tanty.  So there.   If anyone knows.. gimme a hint.

      I just want to say that job hunting is a bitch.  It is demoralising and dehumanising.  You are forever at the mercy of snooty hostpeople.. "no. we're not hiring, but you can fill out an application".  You can just hear the subtext "you can fill out an application but I'll be shredding it to cover my pet hamster's floor later, anyway".   There may be a light at the end of the tunnel though.. In just over an hour, I am starting a trial at a restaurant as a bar tender there.. I have never worked as a bartender before, so this will be interesting.    cross fingers for me.

      I got sucked in, over the weekend.  Betwixt drunken hazes, I went to a talk on the blogging community, where they promised "hundreds of dollars of free booze and food".   urlLink Some Guy  spoke about how blogs will save humanity, or something.  It was boring.  There were lots of people who laughed at jokes I didn't get, and much overt intellectualism and digs at Post-Modernists.  Basically, for one of the few times in my life, I was able to point the finger and laugh at someone geekier than I.  Actually, there was a whole room full of these bespectacled Geeks.  Much long, greasy male ponytails, and jokes about the Matrix and.. gasp..  urlLink Harry Potter Slash fic .  I've been informed that Slash fic is fan fiction about homosexual pairings.  I'm hoping the Harry Potter Slash fic is of the characters at a much older age.. at least the legal age of consent.. or it'just wrong.  Not that Harry Potter isn't wrong on a lot of levels to begin with..   Anyway, the 'hundreds of dollars of booze and food" turned out to be a Keg, one Chateau Cardboard wine, and some cheese and crackers.  We bailed without sampling anything, and walked up to 600 North Michigan to catch  urlLink Finding Nemo  ("wicked daaahk" "I speak Whale") It was Great. Then we got drunk.   So, the crux of this guy's talk was.. linking to another's site is generous and humanity at its best, and gives hope where none is to be had.  The Post Modernists can go running from the room screaming at this thought, apparently.  Yeah, so link away, and save the world.  blah.

       Affleck and Lopez allegedly fell in love while making "Gigli" - but any on-screen proof is dampened by clunky dialogue.

       urlLink Chicago Tribune | Read Between the Lines of Those 28 Missing Pages   I hate to flog the political dead horse about the whole Sept 11/war against terror thing.. I also hate to use my blog as a platform for my political views.. but not enough to do both these things. hah.   The above Chicago Trib article pretty much confirms all I've felt about the inherent wrong-ness in the war against Iraq.  I find it so hard to believe that so many people were sucked in by the Bush junta's propaganda machine.  How was it that Sept 11 so quickly became about Iraq?  Don't get me wrong, I think Saddam is a despot, and it's better that he's gone.. BUT - if you're going to go to war over Oil, or to depose a regime.. call it as that.  Don't use one of the worst days in many people's lives to justify a holy war.  Operation Iraqi Freedom, my ass.    I'm too tired of the whole thing to be really eloquent about it.. or even to put down my arguments in a logical order.  I'll just let you read the above article and come to your own damn conclusions.    On a lighter note..    NEW YORK -- New York City is creating the nation's first public high school for gays, bisexuals and transgender students.   The Harvey Milk High School will enroll about 100 students and open in a newly renovated building in the fall. It is named after San Francisco's first openly gay city supervisor, who was assassinated in 1978.     urlLink read all about it .   Grr.. I never wanted my blog to just be a pointer to news stories.. but.. argh. grr.. etc..   We picked up the photo's from the Road Trip from 'Nam last night.. hopefully  urlLink Andy  will scan them tonight at  urlLink school .  Then.. the uberblog can begin.  Or at least some semblance of one. hm.  I also am having him scan a few pics from the Gay Pride parade.. nothing like buff men in sparkly hotpants to brighten up MY day.

      No.. Incredibly, it's not the latest offering from a low-down bookie in Vegas.. It's the  urlLink Defense Department's  own plan to - practically - enable you to bet on the likelihood of terrorist attacks and political coups.  Well, on a futures market anyway.

       E=mc 2    Yeah, so I am doing this astronomy paper for one of my general education components at Uni.. Anyway, I had to write a five page fricken essay on any subject of my choice, within astronomy.  Stupid me, decided that black holes are interesting, and I should write about those.  hah!   Black holes  are  interesting, but, fuck.. I'm no astrophysicist.  I've read more   Stephen Hawking  than I ever, ever wanted to.    I do think that my IQ has risen a few points though.  I can now use "quantum mechanics" in a sentence, as well as "curvature of spacetime" and "quarks, and other sub-atomic particles".  I be brainy  ....   My mum is visiting at the mo, and she took me &  urlLink 'im indoors  to see  urlLink Race:  How Blacks & Whites think and feel about the American obsession  at  urlLink Lookingglass Theatre .  It was thought provoking.  It's adapted and directed by David Schwimmer - yes, the David Schwimmer, dipshit Ross from  urlLink Friends .    But, much like when I saw  urlLink Joey Fat-one  in  urlLink Rent  and gained some respect for him when I realised he could actually sing, and act.. I likewise gained respect for David Schwimmer, who I realised was actually an intelligent individual, tackling a very tough subject in America.  Go Ross!   Most confronting moment of the play, which wasn't a linear story, but more lots of stories strung together around the same theme, was when the actors came out in Klan hoods.  Intellectually, I knew it was actors inside there, but it still made me feel.. icky.    Anyway, it was good. After that, we headed to  urlLink Melrose  for cheap eats.  mmm. mmm.

        ko paikea apirana tako ingoa   ok, so i suck at Maori.  The title of this blog is supposed to translate roughly as "My name is Paikea Apirana".  Yeah, I know my name is not Paikea Apirana, but that one line of  urlLink Whale Rider  made me and  urlLink Andy  and  urlLink Exxie  get all teary-eyed at the same moment.    So, the gist of the matter is, I finally got to see it.  Whale Rider, that is.     urlLink     As I said to Andy on the way out of the theatre, still wiping tears from my eyes, I was bound to like the movie no matter what, considering my somewhat substantial bias to any and all things kiwi.  However, don't let that undermine the fact that this is a great movie.  I liked it for the fact that it took me home, to summers spent on the beach, to a way of life.  Even though I've grown up in a Pakeha family, I feel that I did learn a lot of respect and love for Maori culture, even if the best phrase I can remember is Hei aha te taima? I do feel strong links to taha maori.  I went to primary at a school that was predominantly maori, my teacher in standard 3 & 4 was the teacher in charge of maori club.  I remember so many times, wishing I could be in the front row of the girls doing poi (i was never good enough to get chosen for outings except to the old people's home).  Poi e was my favourite.  Oh yeah, and who can forget Tutera Mai Nga Iwi (aue, tatou tatou e.. ).. but is this me talking about Whale Rider, or about my golden years of childhood at Arataki Primary?   blah.  Oh well, off to finish my nobel prize winning essay on Black Holes and the Theory of Everything.  Damn, I've read more Stephen Hawking in the last two days than I EVER EVER EVER wanted to.

      So,  yeah.. I just about got struck by lightning on the weekend.      urlLink       Honestly, it was no more than 50m (150ft) away from me - MAX.  I was so fuckin freaked.  I heard that sucker bang inside my friggin head.  I was shaking, thats for bloody sure.  I looked back and all I could see was wood and dirt exploding where the lightning struck.   Yeah, I almost got stuck in a tornado too.  In fact, there was a funnel cloud spotted right in the area I was at that exact moment.  Oh well.  Lightning is pretty damn coo.

      Saw  urlLink Black Eyed Peas  last night @ Summerfest.  I'm just happy cuz they played we be fallin up.. (never fallin down.. keep it at a higher level, elevated ground..) We left before the end, cuz we had to drive all the way back to Chicago from Milwaukee.  There was an awesome thunderstorm in the distance the whole way home.    Also saw some dj called  urlLink BT  who did a house music version of Smells Like Teen Spirit.  If you'd have told me that someone would do that song to a house beat, I would have told you to Fuck Off, because c'mon.. doesn't that sound lame? But.. I was surprised.  It sounded pretty fucking good.    Anyway, we were going to leave the BEP stage early and go watch the Crystal Method set, but since the BEP started almost an hour late, we just went home.  Like the lam-o's we are.    Heh.  Some funny google searches that have been turning up me lately..    urlLink Fly me to the moon restaurant .  (If you are searching for what I wrote about this particular establishment - feel free to read my scathing expose  urlLink here ).   urlLink buy "soda gun" . hmm. no idea.    urlLink Georgina Beyer  - well, since I did just write a big post about her.   Mostly I get people searching for "complete lack of surprise". Sorry, this isn't a blog dedicated to  urlLink Fight Club , though I do recommend the movie, and the book.    Also, scarily enough.. Google lists me on the first page for  urlLink Harry Potter Slash Fic .  *shudder*  But who am I, that you should listen to me?

       urlLink spam  it.   It's 7.48am.. I just took the 'delete immediately' function from the bulk mail box of my hotmail.  Lets see how long it takes for me to get some spam.    Updated @ 10am.. by 8.30am, I had three.  No.. I don't want to enlarge my penis.

      yeah.. fat fucking albert & the rest of the fucking population here.     urlLink read this .    I can fucking attest for the fucking fatness of just about every other yank i see on the street.  I put on about 10-12kg within 5 months of moving here (it dropped right off when I moved back to NZ).. I'm now nearly back down to what I was before I moved here.  But I wasn't fat to start with.  But then neither was  urlLink  this guy  before he was like.. erm.. one.   Yeah.. fucking stop reading this shit on the computer and get out and go for a run.. a walk even.  Just fucking quit whining.  ya fucking fatso.    (i am rather cynical these days)

       Neuromancing the Stone .   Bored today, having exhausted my usual daily blog reads ( urlLink tam ,  urlLink hawk ,  urlLink nick ,  urlLink exxie  & co), yet still feeling that urge to stay put on my arse and read yet more blogs, I decided to take a willy nilly, helter skelter ride through the unknown and see where I ended up.    I started from the Blogger home page and clicked through to a couple of interesting sounding blogs.. which really weren't, so I had to backtrack.  Third time's a charm, they say.. and for me it was.  The blog itself wasn't that great (though it did have a Bush witticism randomly generated), but in the links section.. I saw two words that made me sit up and wipe the crusty sleep boogers from my eyes..  urlLink William Gibson .  Of course! Why wouldn't the man who pretty much predicted the fucking internet have a blog? It took me only a few minutes to realize that his blog is actually written by him.  I feel like I have stumbled upon the promised land.  I get to now read the personal musings of an author that I deeply, truly, really respect?   I've already updated my "endorsements" (cuz we all know how much an endorsement from rraaarr matters.. all 3 of us) section with the link to the blog.    Within the first 120 seconds of reading, I knew that this blog by William Gibson would not let me down.  Reading through his August entries, there's a word I've never heard of before - twice.  My vocabulary is pretty damn extensive, so naturally, I had to find out what this word was - because I'll be damned if I'm going to go around not  knowing  what the hell William Gibson is writing about.  I just can't admit to that.  Apophenia.  It's not even a word in  urlLink dictionary.com .  My trusty  urlLink google  did not let me down though.     urlLink Apophenia :    Apophenia is the spontaneous perception of connections and meaningfulness of unrelated phenomena. The term was coined by K. Conrad in 1958 (Brugger).  The link above gives some interesting examples, then goes on to say:  "According to Brugger, "The propensity to see connections between seemingly unrelated objects or ideas most closely links psychosis to creativity ... apophenia and creativity may even be seen as two sides of the same coin.""  and:  "Brugger notes that one analyst thought he had support for the penis envy theory because more females than males failed to return their pencils after a test. Another spent nine pages in a prestigious journal describing how sidewalk cracks are vaginas and feet are penises, and the old saw about not stepping on cracks is actually a warning to stay away from the female sex organ."  Not much hope for me, in that last part.. y'know, what with being female and all.    Anyway, I love how this post started out about William Gibson hero worship, to learning a new word, to laughing at crazy shrinks.. But then, thats what I love about the internet too, and this whole blogging thing.  In a few short random clicks, you can be immersed in somebody else's world, a new thought, a new idea.  You can follow your train of thought as far as you like, and pretty much indulge yourself to your heart's content... heh. I'm hardly one to wax political or philosophical about the nature of the internet.. but it's a truly democratic system.. or something?                                        g'warn, buy it! it's only $6.99!

      I was not passionate about Rugby when I lived in NZ.. Distance, however, makes the heart grow fonder in this case.   Reading this  urlLink team guide  to the All Blacks on the RWC site has just got me so excited!!  I'm going to have to scour the telly listings on Fox World Sport to catch the games.  woohoo! Go the ABs!

      Can't afford a  urlLink $1.6mill  property? Not even a measly urlLink $430,000  home? Never mind, cuz if you can spare $100US and can belt out a half decent 75 word essay, where they don't even care about  grammar  or  punctuation , then you can still own a house, or an interest in an apartment building, mortgage free.  Only in America.   Anyway, here's the  urlLink link , and here's the  urlLink story  that led me to it.    Personally, I'm leaning towards  urlLink Hot Springs House  or a measly 1/3  share in  urlLink Oxon Apts .

      Who else would release a domain called geek.nz?  Thanks to  urlLink Hawk  for sending me on a  urlLink googling   rampage  searching for how to snap up one of these domains my self.    Andy is now the proud owner of artwank.geek.nz and I, I am the jubilant mother of a bouncing, bubbly 10lb 3oz popculture.geek.nz domain.  (film.geek.nz was already taken) Ahh.. for only $20US a year, I snapped those bubba's up.    No plans for what to do with them yet.. Andy is not really the HTML fanatic that I am, so I will probably end up taking care of his domain too.  Anyway.. seeing as exxie and I  are  starting a magazine about popculture, maybe that would be a good use for the domain?  However, not sure about having a mag based in the US, with a kiwi domain.  Maybe I'll move my blog to that domain, invest in some web hosting, and make the switch to movable type that I've been longing for.. ??  Whatever, rock on NZ.    Here is the  urlLink proposal  that was submitted to the NZ domain name commissioner last year.  I particularly like this part:   We envisage that the creation of geek.nz will foster awareness of New Zealand in international Geek culture, and in making Geeks around the world more aware of how Geek friendly New Zealand is, thus encouraging immigration of Geeks to New Zealand, furthering the Knowledge Economy, and importing both intellectual and fiscal capital.   The creation of   as a second level domain will serve as a focal point for this worthwhile group, allowing Geeks to express their cultural uniqueness and individuality via the Internet. We believe that geek culture crosses all boundaries, ignoring race, gender, geography and religion.   We are applying for   on behalf of all current and future  New Zealand Geeks.    Oh.. and this part -    It could be said that   is a suitable domain for people to make vanity domains under the current structure. This was certainly true for the early days of the New Zealand Internet. This, however, was only true because geeks were by and large the only participants in the early Internet.    And then... they define geek from the hacker dictionary!  Bloody hell, just go and read the proposal yourself!   Genius, I say.  Pure, bloody genius.  What do you expect from a bunch of kiwi geeks though?   *swells with kiwi pride*   Edited to Add  I notice that antisocial.geek.nz is still available.. that would be a  great  bloody domain name. *sigh* I wonder if doman-name.geek.nz is available? heh.

       urlLink Exxie  and I have decided, that since no one else is paying us to write for their magazine, we will write our own.  yeah, we're joining the counter-culture, and releasing a 'zine.    good thing we have web designers and graphic artists for friends, who are just as struggling as we are.   They can hook us up with their skillz, and we can give them something to put in their portfolio I guess.     urlLink Andy  even has his own column.. on artwank.  He's writing an article this month on  urlLink gigposters.com  an artwank music poster site that he goes to.  He's got interviews with the founder of the site  urlLink Clay , and a couple of big time gig poster artists, such as  urlLink Frank Kozik  and  urlLink Art Chantry .  I'm pretty damn impressed.  His article is threatening to outshine anything that exxie or I write.  His article will be the main attraction, and we'll just be filler.   Anyway, for issue after, I'm thinking about writing an article about the network of relationships that people form over the internet, and about how some of these relationships become just as important, if not more, than some of our 'real life' relationships.  Just thinking about it though.  I myself met andy via the internet, and one of my best friends too.  This guy, my friend.. known him for four years, and I still haven't met him, yet he knows me better than a lot of people offline know me.  I'm finally going to meet him in November though..   So yeah, my concept for the article is going to be roughly based upon that, and how somehow sitting at a computer allows us to be more honest with ourselves and others.  I know I'm not the only person out there who has these completely online relationships that become a big part of life.. and I hope I'm not weird for it, either!

      mmm.. two of my love's mingled deliciously.. fine vodka and New Zealand.    I know.  I was sceptical as well.. New Zealand is not exactly known for their fine Vodka making.  But Kiwi's  are  well known for their entrepreneurship (or as we like to say, the ability to do anything with a bit of no 8 fencing wire), and taking on the big boys at their own game and doing well.    It seems to have worked.   urlLink 42 Below  is NZ's first premium vodka.  My guess is, its a lot smoother than  urlLink Count Pushkin  in plastic bottles, that I used to drink when I was a wee, young lass at 16.  Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing but love for the Count.  However, my taste's have become a bit more expensive.    Anyway, 42 below seem like they're doing well for themselves.. especially according to this glowing report from  urlLink Xtra MSN  about them.    Oh yeah, and to give credit where credit is due, i wouldn't have known about 42 below, if it weren't for  urlLink end.co.nz .  I tried to copy his name in chinese, but for some reason it wouldn't do it.  So he goes nameless for now.    I'm so gonna hound my local liquor store for 42 below though.. and start demanding it at bars.  The American people WILL listen!

      well, i've been  inundated  (hah!) with enquiries about how everything turned out with ESS.    Pretty anti-climactic, really.  I got a call from the guy yesterday, so Next Thursday I'm off to learn the ropes. I'm pretty excited about it, but being the shy flower that I am, I'm also nervous about meeting new people.    I am  so  a shy flower!  We'll see it goes after that, but.. it's a step in the right direction.  Especially after the crap I've been through trying to get student loans.  In NZ we complained and complained about the government loan scheme.. there aint nothing to complain about in NZ, compared to here.  I have been in tears several times trying to get a loan.  The government will only loan you so much (and no student allowance, mind you), and you have to get private loans to make up the rest, if you can't afford it still.  Citibank was the first place I tried, as recommended in the loan information my  urlLink school  sent me, and they denied me because of a $55 delinquency that I paid years ago.  I shouldn't even have a delinquency but I was out of the country, blah blah blah.. but $55?! I pay ten times that on my car each month.  bloody oath.    Anyway, I might have a loan approved.. I now just have to worry because they want a copy of my green card, which although I've been approved for it, I only have a stamp in my passport as evidence.  My lawyer says the green card could take anywhere from a few months to a year to get here.  Well, hopefully the loan people will just accept a stamp.  Bah Humbug.    If all else fails, I'll be a hobo, hopping freight trains all over the country for the rest of my life.

      I don't know if any one (out of my positively *thousands* of readers) has read the sidebar on this blog.. the bit where it says:   Aspirations: To become a great screenwriter slash director, and write only films that matter in the whole cosmic scheme of things.    In that spirit, I have recently gone from full-time corporate whore status, to part time corporate whore status, enrolled myself back in University at  urlLink Columbia College Chicago's  film programme (getting myself more in debt than I've ever been in the process), and last week I decided to call around some local production studio's to see if they are in the mind to give out a lil' bit of free edumacation to a kiwi girl who's willing to be the tea lady for a glimpse at the inside of an editing suite..   Anyway, one of the places I called,  urlLink Experimental Sound Studio , said they were between interns, and asked me to come meet them.  So, today I went there to meet with the guy.  We seemed to get along well, and I think I've got myself a wee little internship! It won't be much, but I might get to hang out with cute musician boys at least.  well.. here's hoping. heh heh.

      I never thought Television could be this great! We all need a  urlLink Queer Eye  every now and then.   My plan is to get the Fab Five onto  urlLink Andy .  Our pitch would be that he is a graphic designer going into business for himself, and he needs the lifestyle to go with the job.. y'know.. that ability to accessorize.  Knowing your Gucci from your  Gauche , your  vino  from your vinegar, and definitely (so I'm told), your  urlLink Kyan Douglas  from the rest of us poor, unfortunately   regular  looking peons.    Even Andy's Mum is in love with Kyan Douglas.  Personally.. lets just say that he could grow on me.  But, what with the being GAY and all.. I'm not all tumbling head over heels or anything. Slowly, slowly..    urlLink exxie  loves Kyan.  In fact, I think her exact words were  urlLink "And Kyan Douglas soooo wants to make the sweet animal love with me." .  That exxie.    Anyway, "Bravo", to  urlLink Bravo TV  (yeah, yeah.. i'm so clever) for being ballsy enough to have this show.  Even though it panders somewhat to Gay stereotypes, it's all like.. positive 'n shit.  yeah.  Hey.. I wonder if they'll quote me on that in any literature.    Queer Eye For the Straight Guy.  Where we take a straight guy, send in the Fab Five to funk up his stylez in Grooming, Food, Fashion, Interior Design & Culture.  Critics rave!  "It's all like.. positive 'n shit".. rraaarr, blogger extraordinaire.. .   Prolly not though, eh ?

      well.. "blah" to  urlLink Tam  for her monkey problem.    I've been hilariously and gratuitiously linked  urlLink  here .. it makes me feel all squooshy & popular even if  urlLink exxie   is  my flatmate.    And if you're interested, said tales of mormon masturbation aversion therapy can be found  urlLink here .  As to how legit it is? Can't vouch for it.  But.. it does advocate eating worms while you masturbate.. or tying your hand to the bed so you can't masturbate at night..   I don't know about you.. but just thinking about that all makes me hot 'n horny..  Think I'm gonna go out and.. erm.. do some digging in the garden.. I'll.. erm. be back. yeah.. got the gardening urge.

       The Trip from 'Nam   I'm finally delivering the goods.. the promised travelblog of my holiday with mum &  urlLink Andy .      Saturday July 19, 2003    urlLink Chicago, IL to Wall, SD .  Set the alarm for 4.30am.  Hit snooze.  We'll get up at 5 am.  Hit snooze again.  Get up at 5.30am.  Stumble into car at 6am and leave Chicago to avoid the morning rush.   Illinois passes by in a flash, and before I know it, we're on Interstate 90 heading West out of Wisconsin.  We crossed the Mississippi  (second time I've seen it) into Minnesota (the land of Brandon & Brenda for you  urlLink 90210-o-philes ).  Minnesota is pretty boring.  So is South Dakota..   I started driving just after Mitchell, SD, where we *had* to stop and see the corniest sight (no pun intended)  urlLink The Corn Palace .        And, Damn.. wouldn't you just know that we missed the world famous Corn Palace Festival.   urlLink Tom Jones  was going to be there for fuck's sake! Just my luck. I'd bought undies especially for it, too.    K, enough of bloody Mitchell and the Corn Palace.  Might I add, that I had not seen a single non-white body since we left Wisconsin? It's just one big whitey-fest out there.   We decided to stay in Wall, SD for the first night.  Roughly 900 miles from Chicago.  About 600 miles away from Wall, we started seeing bloody signs on the road side for  urlLink Wall Drug , such as this:       Every five fucking miles, there was another stupid sign for Wall Drug.  "rraaarr", you might ask in innocent wonder, "what is this Wall Drug that must be so marvellous since it has billboards advertising it from 600 miles away in either direction on I-90?".    "Well", I would answer, shaking my head and smiling patronisingly at your foolhardiness, "although Wall Drug purportedly has billboards in the Metro in Paris, and at the South AND North Poles, in addition to the 1200 odd miles of roadside billboards, Wall Drug is nothing but a big tourist trap gone wrong.  In my day, they used to make these videos called "Girls Gone Wild", now they make them about Wall Drug, and call them "Tacky crap Gone Wild". Either that or "When good times go horribly, oh-so-horribly, bad". "  Wall Drug takes up its own city block.  Imagine all the tacky western touristy overpriced crap you can imagine, multiply it by infinity and you sort of come close to Wall Drug.  They do have free ice water and coffee for 5c though, so maybe they're not all that bad.   Mum, Andy & I were unanimous in the feeling that if we ate there, the Powers That Be At Wall Drug would surely brainwash us with their genetically altered "food" and turn us into mindless tourists as well, so we crossed the road and ate at a local joint.  Mmm Mmm buffalo burgers and strawberry daiquiris with real cowboys.  not in the food.. just there.   I also forgot to mention that it was 103 FUCKING degrees (fahrenheit - about 40 Deg C.) that day.  We made the prerequisite for our motel a POOL.    Coolest thing about Day 1:  (apart from the swim)..  The Badlands .  We only got to see them from the side of the road, and not the heart of the Badlands.. but it was still pretty cool. I would go back to Wall, just to see the Badlands again, and spend more time there.  It's this area that has these huge jagged outcroppings of rock, on otherwise smooth land.  It was pretty eerie, and easy to imagine the wagon train-ers in that area.  Freakin out and going back to England, most likely.  heh.  Specially in that FUCKING 103 Degree weather.     Sunday July 20    urlLink Wall to Mt. Rushmore.  Approximately 80 miles.   Got up and left Wall (thank goodness), and headed out to  urlLink Mt. Rushmore .  We left I-90 at Rapid City and drove into the Black Hills to Mt. Rushmore.  You had to pay to go up there, and we could see it from the road, so we just took pictures there instead.  No point paying for something you can see for free.   This is me and my mum there.. *awwww*.         urlLink Mt. Rushmore to Bozeman   We drove on through the Black Hills, which are really pretty.  For me, it was good to see something other than flat dumb stupid prairie land again.  Flat is dumb.    We got into Montana and then stopped at  urlLink Little Bighorn  - aka the site of Custer's Last Stand.  I studied the whole thing in history @ Uni in NZ, so we had to go.  It kinda worried me though, when we started out on this little grassy trail to see some grave markings, and there's this sign at the beginning.. Watch out for Rattlesnakes.  I was wearing sandles, so not too happy about potentially meeting a "rattler".. but lucky for us, there were none to be seen.    All I can really say about Little Bighorn - lots of graves.. Custer was kind of a Dufus.. lots of graves.  cool Indian monument though..         Here's a ghostly pic of the graves.. they put markers down, pretty much where the men fell.  The indians took their own dead away and buried them properly.         We drove on to Bozeman, about another 580 miles from Mt. Rushmore, and stayed there the night in a cheesy motel with a pool again.  Too damn hot not to swim.     Monay July 21  We spent the morning at Hyalite Creek just outside of Bozeman.  Andy fished.  Mum & I just sat and looked pretty on the rocks.  You can see evidence of Andy's fishing prowess  urlLink here .   After that, we drove down to  urlLink Yellowstone , via the North entrance at Gardiner.  $20 per vehicle for a seven day pass.  Not too bad.    Saw some pretty thermal stuff..  urlLink here , and some Bison and  urlLink Elks .  No bears though.   Went for a swim in a mountain stream, in our clothes..  urlLink here .   We didn't camp in Yellowstone itself, because no one remembered to tell us that they only have 1500 camp sites, and during the busiest time of the year you have to pretty much book in advance.. grr.  So, it didn't end up being too bad, we drove to West Yellowstone, and camped right on the border of the park - in a campground that had signs every where that it was "a site frequented by Grizzly &  Black Bears" - with a nice piece of the Madison river to swim in.    This is us outside our Tent.. I think it's kind of American Gothic-esque.. but prolly no one else will.          Tuesday July 22   Drove around Yellowstone seeing as much as we could in one day. I was sick, so didn't do much except lie in the back of the car and sneeze and sleep.  I did get out for Old Faithful to do it's impression of  urlLink a porn star  (I know.. I've always got to take the converstation down into the gutter.. )    Wednesday July 23    urlLink West Yellowstone to Butte .  approx 164 miles.   I was feeling much better, so we did some whitewater rafting.  No photo's sorry.. they were too expensive.  It was my second time rafting (first was on the Rangitikei in NZ).. Our guide used to take rafters in NZ himself, so it was pretty cool.  The water was kind of low, so there wasn't much adrenaline, but it was still nice.    Then we drove to Butte to stay with Andy's grandparents for two nights.     Thursday July 24   Took a ride with a crazy man up a mountain to see  urlLink Our Lady of the Rockies .  It's a monument to women everywhere, specially dead ones or something.  Andy's grandmother's name is there.    Andy's grandparents (his grandpa remarried) took us out to dinner - where, i kid you not - a man with a pompadour AND long hair - played country music for us.  Andy's grandparents knew the guy and his wife.. genuine "good people".. but his hair! MY GOD. His. hair.   urlLink See for yourself .  He's the  first on the left. His wife looked like Linda Ronstadt.     Friday July 23    urlLink Butte to SLC.  approx 420 miles.    urlLink SLC Punk! Yeah!.   Andy's a wuss and cried at leaving his grandparents.. *awwwww*.  We drove to Idaho Falls.  (see  urlLink this prior post  for the pic of Idaho).  Had *the* best meal at this cafe called "The Snakebite Cafe" in Idaho Falls.  I would not have expected to have such a great meal in a two horse town like Idaho Falls.. but apparently my prejudices are wrong, because Idaho Falls seems pretty nice, and all three of us had a  great  lunch.  Mum & I had the Blackened Salmon Salad -   Cajun spiced salmon filet, skewered mushrooms, onions and peppers atop mixe greens with diced tomatoes, feta cheese and a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette .  Mmm Mmm Good.   Andy liked Idaho Falls..         Then off to SLC.  Andy and I didn't have long, we were driving on.. but Mum was staying in SLC and then catching a train out to San Fran.  So, with the little time we had, we decided to look around the Mormon temple.  We took a half hour free guided tour.  The people there are freaky in ways I can't imagine.  They all wear the same clothes and talk in that scary soft happy way that reminds me of the kids in  urlLink "Village of the Damned" .  *shudder*.  The culmination of the tour was that they took us into this room, removed our brain's for science, and replaced us with these really real looking robots, so we can secretly help them succeed in their plan for world domination. .. er.. oops.. uhm.. i mean, all they did was take us to the top of a spiral ramp into this room that was painted like space with planets etc, and this huge statue of Jesus.  They then played a tape recording of his voice "talking" to us, while the Jesus statue's eyes began to mysteriously rotate in such a way that I couldn't... look.. away.. I Love The Master.  Anyway, yeah.. a little too attempted brainwashing there.. even if the bit about the eyes wasn't true.    We left mum to fend for herself against  the rabid  urlLink mormon's , and we drove on to Wyoming.     urlLink SLC to Rawlins  - approx another 300miles.   There's not much to report on this section, except that the hills just outside of SLC and in early Wyoming are really cool.. you can see all the different layers of the earth, and they're all jagged and red and bare.  No pics though. Sorry.   We stayed at the ickiest motel yet.  no pool even.  grr.      Saturday July 24    urlLink Rawlins to Chicago  - 1115 miles.  Holy Crap.   Andy & I just kept on driving for this one.  Fuckin A. I don't know how we did it, but we did.  We got home at 3am in the morning.  Slept all Sunday.  Through the rest of Wyoming, then Nebraska (longest, most boring state EVER.  E-VER.) Iowa then Illinois.    For some scope on the distances here.. Cape Reinga to Wellington is approx 681 miles, and Nelson to Invercargill is about 624 miles.    The End.  Fin.

      *sigh* I  know .  I've technically retired from blogging.   BUT... who could resist this snippet of info?  "News of Australia’s prowess as a gay nation came in the annual Durex sex survey published this week in the Australian media. It found that 17 per cent of all couples in Australia were living in a gay or lesbian relationship – the highest of all countries surveyed."  From the ever-gay  urlLink scoop.co.nz .    By the way ... for those who are still hanging on to my every oh-so-sexily type written word..   I started school again this past week, at  urlLink Columbia College .  Yep, my loans and shit all got worked out, now my credit card company is over $200 richer from my purchase of school books.  But.. funnily enough, I'm sorta kinda maybe happy. Yes, the school is full of a bunch of wannabe artwanks.  They're also all about 2 or 3 years younger than me. Often, they're rich wanker bastards who have mummy and daddy financing their studies and I hate every last one of them.. but, still.. i'm there. And I'm going to be making a 3minute silent film on a bolex 16 mm camera on saturday and.. well.. YAY! :)

      a couple of people have actually taken the time to not only wonder why I haven't updated my blog recently, but have cared enough to ask me/prompt me to update again.  some people have less of lives than  I  do. heh.   uhm. To answer their questions.. there's a simple fact. Well.. two facts actually.   One is that the template is fucked.  Scroll down to the bottom of this page and you'll see there is no end to my madness.. I really don't want to post anything else until I can fix that, and my normal fixes for this blog-template animorphing disaster have not worked.  I'll probably just scrap the whole blog.   Which brings me to my next point.  This blog s.u.c.k.s. If it didn't suck so much, I would put more effort into fixing the stupid template and posting more.  But because it has such a major case of Suckulosa Majorosi, (you need   more   evidence than that, of the general suckiness that is my blog?) I can not be bothered expending the energy to do so.  My energy is far better spent in the pursuit of blind drunkenness (which reminds me of last weekend.. ).    If it's good blogs ya want (ya mangy bastards) (i just threw that in there for no reason in particular) (see, I'm really sucky.. I have to use brackets a lot - I can't even keep up a good sense of sentence structure), then go  urlLink here ,  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Oh yeah, and go to Dan's Xanga site.. i don't know the URL off by heart, so just choose denjang from the side bar.  The side bar that is also fucked, by the way.

      In addition to Sept 11 rememberances, go to  urlLink this  salon article, on "Forbidden thoughts about 9/11".  It's all the crap we were afraid to admit we felt.  I found the link from  urlLink end.co.nz .    As much as that day was probably the biggest historical event that I have been directly exposed to, I think I identify more with the people in the Salon article above, than with all the uber-patriots afterwards.    I don't want to get into the whole debate on things, because.. well, no matter what happened, people died, and that sucks.  Lets just say that I completely disagree with the way that the events were capitalised upon, both by the public, and by the Government.    This is (hopefully) my last sept 11 postever.  To tell you the truth, I'm  sick  of it.  Bring on the criticism for that last comment.

      It's  urlLink exxie's  birthday today.  So  urlLink go  tell her happy birthday.  And read her blog too, she's funny.    Anyway, I heard this joke once, before I lived in Chicago, about Chicagoans.  It's one of those jokes that if you haven't lived in Chicago for at least a year before, you think is semi-amusing at best.  If, like me, you then reflect on that joke after several yearly cycles in this city, you begin to see the real humour in it.   The joke goes like this:  A Cubs fan dies and goes to Hell.  After a while, Satan notices that the guy doesn't seem too bothered by the heat, so he turns it up a little bit.  The Cubs fan shrugs to him self as says "it ain't so bad, it's just like a day in late June in Chicago".   Satan isn't so pleased with that, so he turns up the heat again, and goes to check on the Cubs fan.   The Cubs fan takes off his jacket and says "It ain't so bad, it's just like Chicago in July".  Satan turns up the heat one more time, and is so mad when the cubs fan merely fans himself and says "It's just like Chicago in August", that Satan turns the heat all the way down to freezing.    The Cubs Fan drops to his knees and yells, "Oh My God! The Cubs won the World Series!".   There's two things I like about this joke.  One the reference to the extremes of temperature we here in Chicago experience.  That damned summer heat and humidity makes walking down the street more like swimming down the street.. in a pool of sweat.    The other thing is the reference to the perenially losing Cubs team.  The Cubs are such a Chicago institution (along with the White Sox), the lovable losers, the underdogs.    For the first time in god knows how long, both the Cubs & the Sox are in first place in their division, and everybody is somewhat happy.  Only "somewhat", because everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop.  People are surprised when the Cubs win, not the other way round.    Anyway, what I think is actually cool, is the legend of the curse of the cubs.    I got this from a  urlLink Review  on the Billy Goat Tavern, the bar that started it all..    As for the actual billygoat mentioned above, its notoriety does not end with the Billy Goat Tavern. I wish it did. You see, the Chicago Cubs haven't been in the World Series since 1945, and haven't won one since 1908. Many attribute this misfortune to the "Curse of the Billy Goat." The alleged curse was placed on the Cubs during the 1945 World Series by Billy Goat Sianis himself. Sianis happened to be a rabid Cubs fan and attempted to bring his goat, "Murphy," into game four. Murphy even had his own ticket. As Sianis walked into Wrigley Field, the ushers prevented his entry, telling him that no goats were allowed. When Billy Goat asked for an appeal directly to owner P.K. Wrigley, P.K. told them to allow Billy Goat in but not Murphy. When Billy Goat asked why, they said, "Because the goat smells." In retaliation, Sianis cast a "goat curse" over the Cubs by saying, "Cubs, they not gonna win anymore." Subsequently, the Tigers won the series and the Cubs have never been back. The Cubs' loss prompted Billy Goat to send a telegram to P.K. Wrigley asking, "Who smells now?" Billy Goat supposedly lifted the curse in 1969, but the Cubs blew a nine game lead that year to the lowly Mets, causing some to believe that the curse remains in place.  Billy's nephew, Sam Sianis, now owns the tavern. To lift the "remnants" of the curse, Sam twice pulled up to Wrigley Field in 1972 and 1983, in a white limousine with a red carpet, a goat named "Socrates," and a sign that read, "All is forgiven. Let me lead the Cubs to the pennant. Billy Goat." Sam was denied entry by Cubs management both times. The curse was then lifted in 1984, when Cubs management finally relented and Sam brought the goat to opening day. The Cubs won the division, but lost to the Padres in the playoffs. Sam again brought the goat to Wrigley in 1994 after the Cubs lost their first 12 home games. The Cubs won their next game, but the season was cut short due to the players' strike. The goat made its last appearance in 1998, a year that saw the Cubs win a wild card berth in the playoffs but then lose to Greg Maddux (former Cub) and the Braves. Because the Cubs continue to show occasional promise but always lose in the end, some still believe the hex remains in place.

       Sept 11   I was determined not to think about 9/11 today.  Last night, Andy and I went out for Sushi, and he mentioned how 9/11/2001 seemed so long ago, yet it seemed like just yesterday at the same time.  Images of newspaper & tv pictures of people jumping and falling from the towers flashed into my mind, and with a lump in my throat, I told him I didn't want to think about it.    I guess I shouldn't have logged on to the internet today then, either.  Or turned on the radio or the TV.  When I go outside, I'm sure there'll be a re-surgence in American Flags hanging from apartment windows, like there were for so long two years ago.    But here I am, and after reading several op-ed pieces from the  urlLink New York Times  which I get delivered to my mailbox, and after reading  Hawk's  reminiscences of that day.. there's not much I can do but to think about what happened.. again.  Like I think I have for every day since it happened.  So.. here follows what I was doing that day.    Like I usually did every morning back then, I watched Fox news in the morning.  As I dressed, they switched to live coverage of breaking story at the World Trade Center, moments after the first plane crashed into the building.  They didn't know what it was, they said.. they didn't know how big the plane was, what had happened.  I remember noticing how clear and blue the sky was in New York that day, as it was in Chicago too, and thinking that no one could have accidentally flown into the building.  Either the plane malfunctioned.. or.. but the "or" was too farfetched, so I thought, to further contemplate.    I called Andy, who was already at work, and let him know that a plane had flown into one of the towers, but they didn't know what it was.  All this time, the picture on the TV was just the Tower burning, no cut-aways, nothing.  I hung up the phone and turned to continue getting ready for work.  Behind me I heard the news presenter gasp "Oh my god, another plane!".  I whirled around in time to see the second plane smash into the second tower.  I think that's the second I knew everything had changed.  The event had gone from a possible accident to two very pre-meditated savage acts of terror.    I watched long enough to see the third plane crash into the Pentagon, and then I decided to go to work, I was already late.  My boss was on a cruise, but I still had to open the office.  I remember the el that day was packed, as it often was.  Today, however, there was no buzz of small talk, just silence and drawn faces.  A girl next to me was listening to the news on her walkman.  Her knees buckled and she fell against me and told me that one of the towers had fallen down, collapsed.  She told the people around us that if they worked downtown, not to bother, because they were evacuating it.  Evacuating downtown? Evacuating the commerce and trade center of a major US city like Chicago?   I ran into work once I got off the el.  I was the first one into the office, even being 45 minutes late.  Lourdes, the other office girl was supposed to be going down town to file some paperwork for the lawyers we worked for. I turned on the TV's in the office and just sat, jaw to the floor, as I saw the second tower collapse.  Hector, Lourdes' husband called me, frantic, asking where she was.  I told him she was supposed to go downtown today.  There were rumours on the TV about another plane being hijacked, and on its way to Chicago.  I tried calling my Mum - it took me about 10 tries to get through.  We were lucky if we got a dial tone when we picked up the phone.. that only added to my panic.  I woke Mum up in New Zealand and cried out something about terrorist attacks, I was in tears.  I calmed down enough to tell her to turn on the TV, and waited while she did.  I heard her heart miss a beat as she took in the pictures.    The thing I remember is the silence that was everywhere you went after that.  There was nothing to be happy about, and if you did smile or laugh, you stopped suddenly, feeling guilty.  Everybody went around glued to news sources, but silent and awestruck for the most part.  Scared.    We got sick of seeing the pictures of the towers coming down, and eventually the news stations stopped playing them.    Two days later, the Chicago Tribune and the Sun Times released big  special issues about the day.  Andy bought both copies, and brought them home.  We looked through the pictures together, and I remember crying for an hour straight, huddled on the floor.  I think it was the picture of the two people jumping from a building, holding hands, that really got me.  Still gets me when I think about it now.    I haven't cried about it again, though I've been close to tears since.    I still don't agree with the War on Iraq, and definitely not with the way it has been executed.  No matter how scared I was that day, or in the days following, I don't see the link between 9/11 and Iraq.  In  urlLink this  article in the NY Times, the author makes a great point, that I think pretty much sums up my feelings on the matter.     "By pretending Iraq was crawling with Al Qaeda, they've created an Iraq crawling with Al Qaeda."

      A weird thing happened today.    I talked with all my three sisters on the phone, at one time.  It was almost like I was there in the room with them.    If you've grown up around your siblings your whole life, this situation is pretty much unremarkable.  I've grown up as an only child.  My mum split from my Dad when I was 18 months old to get away from  his abusiveness, the last time I saw him or any of my sisters I was five.  My sister Carlene was 6 weeks old, and my elder sister Sarah was probably about 13 or 14 and had already been shipped off to a children's home.  Nadia was about 4.    Nadia and Carlene's mother was Elaine, my father's fourth wife.  They just celebrated their 17th wedding anniversary last month.  Carlene said she didn't know what to get them, so she bought a frame for a picture of the two of them that had been lying around gathering dust for a while.  My dad cried.  Elaine was diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer, a couple of months ago.  About three weeks ago, they stopped treatment for the cancer, and gave her two months to live.  Yesterday, she died.    I have several short recollections of Elaine - she was always good to me.  I remember she knitted me this really cool white jersey once, it was my favourite until I grew out of it a few years later.  I remember watching She-ra at her mum's house across the road.  I remember my Dad beating her and making her cry.  She protected me then, just like my Mum would have protected me had she been there.    Elaine eventually tamed the beast that was my father, and apparently he hasn't laid a hand on her, my two younger sisters, or our youngest brother David, for many a long year.  I gotta give props to any woman who can do that.    Elaine must be a much more forgiving person than I am, for staying with my Dad after what he has done.  I can't even bring myself to address him as "Dad", and have maintained a civil relationship only with him, as I can't believe a leopard changes his spots that easily.  Even if he is no longer violent, there are despicable traits he still possesses.  But - he is only human - and it's human to feel, especially pain.  My sisters both say that he appears to be holding up, but it is just a brave face he is putting on.  I find it hard to imagine him experiencing such emotion.    No matter what my feelings are for my father, I have always wanted to maintain contact with my sisters, if for no more reason than that they are my sisters.  I've talked to Carlene & Nadia a few times on the phone.  Sarah, eight years older than me, has led a very troubled life, and she has drifted in and out of contact.  Recently, my mum was back in the UK and made it a priority to track Sarah down.  Sarah still considers my mum more of a mother than her own.  Mum still considers Sarah a daughter, and it was one of the hardest things she ever had to do, to leave my Dad knowing she couldn't take Sarah with us.  I spoke to Sarah on the phone for the first time in years two weeks ago. Her son, Nathan, calls me Aunty Lynda.    It's sad that it had to take Elaine's death to get all four of us together where we could talk and interact as sisters for the first time.  Sarah, Nadia & Carlene stayed up and talked to me on the phone, and for the first time in my life, I felt a part of something bigger than myself.  I could hear the three of them laughing and interacting in the background.  I wondered how much alike we are, not only in looks, but mannerisms, tastes, humour, behaviour..   We talked, and laughed, and commiserated.  Just like I imagine real sisters to do.  Sisters who have been together their whole lives.  We made plans for me to fly out to the UK to visit them in a year and a half when Carlene will have turned 18, and we can all go out boozing to the bars.  We can share drunken stories of first loves, first kisses, first fucks, first heartbreaks.. just like sisters are supposed to do.  Sarah and I have already decided that as the two oldest, we have a responsibility to teach the other two how to get fucked up right.  It feels strange being the oldest sister to anybody, especially people who are essentially strangers.    It's still strange that I should be 23 and not have talked to my sisters all at once, let alone been in the same room with them at the same time.  How much "big sister" stuff have I already missed out on?  Anyway, Elaine - even though I didn't know her very well, I have to have respect for any woman that obviously honestly loved a man such as my father to stay with him for as long as she did, and bear three children to him.  Maybe she actually made him into a human.

       censorship in general.. blah   Read  urlLink Salon's  article about stupid censorship in America.  I'm too tired to really write much, so just watch the ten second ad and then read the article.  The author pretty much sums up my feelings.    Just a few notes though:  If there  has  to be censorship at all, then:  *  Why is it ok to show two men (Will Smith & Martin Lawrence) leering over a dead woman's breasts in Bad Boys II, but it's not ok to show a man's penis in Bernardo Bertolucci's latest movie (in America)?  *  Why is it that male nudity gains a higher rating than female nudity (e.g. it is ok to objectify a woman nude, but not a man).   *  Why is it that gay sex gains a higher rating than lesbian sex? (see above).   *  Why is it that a  urlLink song about the objectification of women in hip hop and rap - using lyrics from  urlLink actual  songs to make the point - is censored, but the songs used were not considered offensive at all?   Read about this  urlLink here    as a note, Sarah Jone's sued the FCC for censoring her song on the grounds they did (indecency & obscenity), and after about two years, they rescinded the ban and the fine they had placed on the radio station that had played the track.  I still find it incredible that it should have happened at all, especially considering the "indecency & obscenity" used to describe women in much of the popular media today that goes unmentioned .   blah, i thought I was too tired for this! Anyway, double standards suck.    Righty-ho, off to bed for me.

       The End is Nigh... and other news.   Apparently, there's a great big  urlLink Asteroid  hurtling it's way through space at 19 miles a second towards Earth, and could hit sometime in 2014.  Or not.  It is there, but with only a few days of observation, the threat is one in 909,000 (which is still a greater chance of winning Lotto), and with each piece of new info we get about it, the threat lessens.  So much for my plans to launch a line of stylish & witty doom-saying sandwich boards.    So much for freedom of the press, freedom of information and the democratic results of google.   urlLink Google , under legal notification from Sharman Networks (the owner of Kazaa), removed links to sites which have a pirated version of Kazaa available on them.  Luckily for us, the  urlLink complaint  lists those sites as:  "a. http://www.kazaagold.com b. http://mp3download.com c. http://www.kazaalite.tk d. http://www.kaaza.com e. http://doa2.host.sk f. http://www.k-lite.tk g. http://www.kazaa-file-sharing-downloads.com h. http://www.kazaalite.nl i. http://home/hccnet.nl/h.edskes/mirror.htm j. http://www.kazaa-download.de k. http://www.zeropaid.com l. http//www.kazaalite.nl/downloads.htm m. http://kazaa.infos-du-net.com n. http://www.kazaa-lite.tk o. http://www.kazaa-lite.info"  I'm not going to link those, you can bloody well type in the address yourselves.  Lazy *cough*criminal*cough* bastards. :)   Apparently, L.Ron Hubbard's extended science fiction fantasy, the  urlLink Church of Scientology  has also had google remove links to them that are considered to infringe on their copyright.    It's just another grey area, I guess.  While I did do my fair share of ripping off the man back in the Napster days (back when napster was still cool), I have now tired of a crappy dial up connection & can't be bothered waiting a half hour to download a three minute song that will probably not even finish downloading in the first place. I'd rather just shell out $6 for a decent used copy of the whole cd.  Anyway, it puts me in the curious position of being able to be moral about the whole situation.  I certainly do not endorse ripping people off, but when I think the RIAA is ripping the artists off for the most part themselves... ahh, but I digress.   My point actually lies somewhere around the fact that - yes, ripping people off is wrong.  But so is hiding information from us.  Especially when the somewhat savvy of us will always find away around it.  (I've always maintained that there's nothing you can buy on the internet, that you can't find for free somewhere else on the internet).  The premise of the action on behalf of Kazaa against google is rooted in copyright infringement.  But if google can be strong armed into designing results to hide that information, they can also be strong armed into hiding other information on other searches.  You don't want kids knowing about information harmful to Big Tobacco? Slap some kind of legalese at google and next thing you know, a search on  urlLink "effects of smoking"  turns up a site on how sexy a cigarette is, or some such bullshit, instead of the myriad of anti-smoking sites it does right now.  Or maybe not that, but could Philip Morris lawyer their way to the top of google results, instead?    Not that my trust in google is entirely intact anymore, anyway.  Now that Blogger has been bought out by google, this very blog is in the top ten results for just waaay too  many searches.  (read  urlLink Kyan Douglas )  I don't know, maybe its all a bit far-fetched and cyber-consipiratorial, and maybe The Man really does have our best interests at heart.  All I know is, that if I google Kazaa, I'm sure as hell not going to indulge in copyright infringement just because those results came up, but, we should be able to trust in the integrity of our information sources.

      not that anyone cares, but I wrote a crappy 5 page screenplay for school.. i linked it on the sidebar.  It's oh-so-creatively named "screenplay".   BTW - I wrote it to specific instructions - e.g. length, no dialogue etc.. so that accounts for at least part of the ultra-crappacino nature of it.

      Considering my skyrocketing sitemeter stats for google searches on  urlLink "cubs jokes" ,  urlLink "cubs fan"  and this  urlLink Fox News  story that someone is  already  making the whole thing into a movie.. I have to put in my two cents (as always)..    urlLink     First off.. for those three people living under the rock in the desert that don't know the story yet (and kiwi's..) - a bit of history and the story.    The Chicago Cubs are losers.. I've posted before about the  urlLink Curse of the Cubs , so I won't get into that bit.  Suffice to say - Chicagoans (more specifically North Siders) love their lovable loser Cubs.  With a Passion.  The Cubs got to the playoffs for the first time since the 1980s this year.  Nobody could believe it.  Suddenly people who really never gave a fuck about baseball one way or the other (like me), were paying attention to the scores.  We played the Atlanta Braves.  And beat them.  I was watching TV at my home about 4 blocks south of Wrigley Field when we won the series against Atlanta - I wasn't even watching the game, but I knew we won because of the yelling and cheering.   urlLink exxie  and I turned on the news to see crowds of cheering people outside Wrigley, so we decided to take a walk up there and join in.  Ever since that night, the mood in Chicago has been.. unique.  Complete strangers would come up to you and talk to you about the Cubs and baseball.. and you would respond and enjoy some kind of a connection with this stranger, because you were both rooting for the Cubs.  Who cares if you'd never watched baseball before in your life?  In class, different people would get the scores during matches and report them to us, at the el station strangers listening to walkmans would yell out the scores for anyone to hear - at work, it was all anyone could talk about.  Normally, a Chicagoan will look at you funny if you ask them the time.    Then, during the series with Florida, an excited fan tried to catch a ball that came close to him, at the same time as a fielder was trying to catch it.. He didn't catch it and the ball went into the dugout, too difficult a place for the fielder to reach and catch the person out.  The cubs were up 3-0 at that point, bottom of the 7th inning.  They blew their lead, and the Florida Marlins ended up winning 8-3. Not the guys fault at all.. but the Cubs let it get to them, and they lost that game, and the next game, and now they're out of the running for the World Series.. The curse came back, seemingly.    That guy - the fan - works at my work.  In my building.  Two floors below me.  Poor guy.  Everyone's blaming him and it's not his fault.  My personal opinion? The Cubs are professionals and shouldn't have let the fan interference get to them so much - they should have remained focused on the game.    The fan - the one they now call goatboy - has had his name released to the media, and his address released - they told everyone where he works - there will be NO rest for this guy.  The worst thing - he's a diehard Cubbie fan.. he coaches little league and everything.  What really gets me is that the enjoyment of the game will be totally gone for him now. And that sucks.    Oh well.. at least the  urlLink All Blacks  are winners.

      "Answers please, Mr Bush"    Monday October 6, 2003  The Guardian    I have seven questions for you, Mr Bush. I ask them on behalf of the 3,000 who died that September day, and I ask them on behalf of the American people. We seek no revenge against you. We want only to know what happened, and what can be done to bring the murderers to justice, so we can prevent any future attacks on our citizens.   1. Is it true that the Bin Ladens have had business relations with you and your family off and on for the past 25 years?   Most Americans might be surprised to learn that you and your father have known the Bin Ladens for a long time. What, exactly, is the extent of this relationship, Mr Bush? Are you close personal friends, or simply on-again, off-again business associates? Salem bin Laden - Osama's brother - first started coming to Texas in 1973 and later bought some land, built himself a house, and created Bin Laden Aviation at the San Antonio airfield.   The Bin Ladens are one of the wealthiest families in Saudi Arabia. Their huge construction firm virtually built the country, from the roads and power plants to the skyscrapers and government buildings. They built some of the airstrips America used in your dad's Gulf war. Billionaires many times over, they soon began investing in other ventures around the world, including the US. They have extensive business dealings with Citigroup, General Electric, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and the Fremont Group.   According to the New Yorker, the bin Laden family also owns a part of Microsoft and the airline and defence giant Boeing. They have donated $2m to your alma mater, Harvard University, and tens of thousands to the Middle East Policy Council, a think-tank headed by a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Charles Freeman. In addition to the property they own in Texas, they also have real estate in Florida and Massachusetts. In short, they have their hands deep in our pants.   Unfortunately, as you know, Mr Bush, Salem bin Laden died in a plane crash in Texas in 1988. Salem's brothers - there are around 50 of them, including Osama - continued to run the family companies and investments.   After leaving office, your father became a highly paid consultant for a company known as the Carlyle Group - one of the nation's largest defence contractors. One of the investors in the Carlyle Group - to the tune of at least $2m - was none other than the Bin Laden family. Until 1994, you headed a company called CaterAir, which was owned by the Carlyle Group.   After September 11, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal both ran stories pointing out this connection. Your first response, Mr Bush, was to ignore it. Then your army of pundits went into spin control. They said, we can't paint these Bin Ladens with the same brush we use for Osama. They have disowned Osama! They have nothing to do with him! These are the good Bin Ladens.   And then the video footage came out. It showed a number of these "good" Bin Ladens - including Osama's mother, a sister and two brothers - with Osama at his son's wedding just six and a half months before September 11. It was no secret to the CIA that Osama bin Laden had access to his family fortune (his share is estimated to be at least $30m), and the Bin Ladens, as well as other Saudis, kept Osama and his group, al-Qaida, well funded.   You've gotten a free ride from the media, though they know everything I have just written to be the truth. They seem unwilling or afraid to ask you a simple question, Mr Bush: WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?   In case you don't understand just how bizarre the media's silence is regarding the Bush-Bin Laden connections, let me draw an analogy to how the press or Congress might have handled something like this if the same shoe had been on the Clinton foot. If, after the terrorist attack on the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, it had been revealed that President Bill Clinton and his family had financial dealings with Timothy McVeigh's family, what do you think your Republican party and the media would have done with that one?   Do you think at least a couple of questions might have been asked, such as, "What is that all about?" Be honest, you know the answer. They would have asked more than a couple of questions. They would have skinned Clinton alive and thrown what was left of his carcass in Guantanamo Bay.   2. What is the 'special relationship' between the Bushes and the Saudi royal family?   Mr Bush, the Bin Ladens are not the only Saudis with whom you and your family have a close personal relationship. The entire royal family seems to be indebted to you - or is it the other way round?   The number one supplier of oil to the US is the nation of Saudi Arabia, possessor of the largest known reserves of oil in the world. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, it was really the Saudis next door who felt threatened, and it was your father, George Bush I, who came to their rescue. The Saudis have never forgotten this. Haifa, wife of Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the US, says that your mother and father "are like my mother and father. I know if ever I needed anything I could go to them".   A major chunk of the American economy is built on Saudi money. They have a trillion dollars invested in our stock market and another trillion dollars in our banks. If they chose suddenly to remove that money, our corporations and financial institutions would be sent into a tailspin, causing an economic crisis the likes of which has never been seen. Couple that with the fact that the 1.5m barrels of oil we need daily from the Saudis could also vanish on a mere royal whim, and we begin to see how not only you, but all of us, are dependent on the House of Saud. George, is this good for our national security, our homeland security? Who is it good for? You? Pops?   After meeting with the Saudi crown prince in April 2002, you happily told us that the two of you had "established a strong personal bond" and that you "spent a lot of time alone". Were you trying to reassure us? Or just flaunt your friendship with a group of rulers who rival the Taliban in their suppression of human rights? Why the double standard?   3. Who attacked the US on September 11 - a guy on dialysis from a cave in Afghanistan, or your friend, Saudi Arabia?   I'm sorry, Mr Bush, but something doesn't make sense.   You got us all repeating by rote that it was Osama bin Laden who was responsible for the attack on the United States on September 11. Even I was doing it. But then I started hearing strange stories about Osama's kidneys. Suddenly, I don't know who or what to trust. How could a guy sitting in a cave in Afghanistan, hooked up to dialysis, have directed and overseen the actions of 19 terrorists for two years in the US then plotted so perfectly the hijacking of four planes and then guaranteed that three of them would end up precisely on their targets? How did he organise, communicate, control and supervise this kind of massive attack? With two cans and a string?   The headlines blared it the first day and they blare it the same way now two years later: "Terrorists Attack United States." Terrorists. I have wondered about this word for some time, so, George, let me ask you a question: if 15 of the 19 hijackers had been North Korean, rather than Saudi, and they had killed 3,000 people, do you think the headline the next day might have read, "NORTH KOREA ATTACKS UNITED STATES"? Of course it would. Or if it had been 15 Iranians or 15 Libyans or 15 Cubans, I think the conventional wisdom would have been, "IRAN [or LIBYA or CUBA] ATTACKS AMERICA!" Yet, when it comes to September 11, have you ever seen the headline, have you ever heard a newscaster, has one of your appointees ever uttered these words: "Saudi Arabia attacked the United States"?   Of course you haven't. And so the question must - must - be asked: why not? Why, when Congress released its own investigation into September 11, did you, Mr Bush, censor out 28 pages that deal with the Saudis' role in the attack?   I would like to throw out a possibility here: what if September 11 was not a "terrorist" attack but, rather, a military attack against the United States? George, apparently you were a pilot once - how hard is it to hit a five-storey building at more than 500 miles an hour? The Pentagon is only five stories high. At 500 miles an hour, had the pilots been off by just a hair, they'd have been in the river. You do not get this skilled at learning how to fly jumbo jets by being taught on a video game machine at some dipshit flight training school in Arizona. You learn to do this in the air force. Someone's air force.   The Saudi air force?   What if these weren't wacko terrorists, but military pilots who signed on to a suicide mission? What if they were doing this at the behest of either the Saudi government or certain disgruntled members of the Saudi royal family? The House of Saud, according to Robert Baer's book Sleeping With the Devil, is full of them. So, did certain factions within the Saudi royal family execute the attack on September 11? Were these pilots trained by the Saudis? Why are you so busy protecting the Saudis when you should be protecting us?   4. Why did you allow a private Saudi jet to fly around the US in the days after September 11 and pick up members of the Bin Laden family and fly them out of the country without a proper investigation by the FBI?   Private jets, under the supervision of the Saudi government - and with your approval - were allowed to fly around the skies of America, when travelling by air was forbidden, and pick up 24 members of the Bin Laden family and take them first to a "secret assembly point in Texas". They then flew to Washington DC, and then on to Boston. Finally, on September 18, they were all flown to Paris, out of the reach of any US officials. They never went through any serious interrogation. This is mind-boggling. Might it have been possible that at least one of the 24 Bin Ladens would have possibly known something?   While thousands were stranded and could not fly, if you could prove you were a close relative of the biggest mass murderer in US history, you got a free trip to gay Paree!   Why, Mr Bush, was this allowed to happen?   5. Why are you protecting the Second Amendment rights of potential terrorists?   Mr Bush, in the days after September 11, the FBI began running a check to see if any of the 186 "suspects" the feds had rounded up in the first five days after the attack had purchased any guns in the months leading up to September 11 (two of them had). When your attorney general, John Ashcroft, heard about this, he immediately shut down the search. He told the FBI that the background check files could not be used for such a search and these files were only to be used at the time of a purchase of a gun.   Mr Bush, you can't be serious! Is your administration really so gun nutty and so deep in the pocket of the National Rifle Association? I truly love how you have rounded up hundreds of people, grabbing them off the streets without notice, throwing them in prison cells, unable to contact lawyers or family, and then, for the most part, shipped them out of the country on mere immigration charges.   You can waive their Fourth Amendment protection from unlawful search and seizure, their Sixth Amendment rights to an open trial by a jury of their peers and the right to counsel, and their First Amendment rights to speak, assemble, dissent and practise their religion. You believe you have the right to just trash all these rights, but when it comes to the Second Amendment right to own an AK-47 - oh no! That right they can have - and you will defend their right to have it.   Who, Mr Bush, is really aiding the terrorists here?   6. Were you aware that, while you were governor of Texas, the Taliban travelled to Texas to meet with your oil and gas company friends?   According to the BBC, the Taliban came to Texas while you were governor to meet with Unocal, the huge oil and energy giant, to discuss Unocal's desire to build a natural-gas pipeline running from Turkmenistan through Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and into Pakistan.   Mr Bush, what was this all about?   "Houston, we have a problem," apparently never crossed your mind, even though the Taliban were perhaps the most repressive fundamentalist regime on the planet. What role exactly did you play in the Unocal meetings with the Taliban?   According to various reports, representatives of your administration met with the Taliban or conveyed messages to them during the summer of 2001. What were those messages, Mr Bush? Were you discussing their offer to hand over Bin Laden? Were you threatening them with use of force? Were you talking to them about a pipeline?   7. What exactly was that look on your face in the Florida classroom on the morning of September 11 when your chief of staff told you, 'America is under attack'?   On the morning of September 11, you took a jog on a golf course and then headed to Booker elementary school in Florida to read to little children. You arrived at the school after the first plane had hit the north tower in New York City. You entered the classroom around 9am and the second plane hit the south tower at 9.03am. Just a few minutes later, as you were sitting in front of the class of kids, your chief of staff, Andrew Card, entered the room and whispered in your ear. Card was apparently telling you about the second plane and about us being "under attack".   And it was at that very moment that your face went into a distant glaze, not quite a blank look, but one that seemed partially paralysed. No emotion was shown. And then ... you just sat there. You sat there for another seven minutes or so doing nothing.   George, what were you thinking? What did that look on your face mean?   Were you thinking you should have taken reports the CIA had given you the month before more seriously? You had been told al-Qaida was planning attacks in the United States and that planes would possibly be used.   Or were you just scared shitless?   Or maybe you were just thinking, "I did not want this job in the first place! This was supposed to be Jeb's job; he was the chosen one! Why me? Why me, daddy?"   Or ... maybe, just maybe, you were sitting there in that classroom chair thinking about your Saudi friends - both the royals and the Bin Ladens. People you knew all too well that might have been up to no good. Would questions be asked? Would suspicions arise? Would the Democrats have the guts to dig into your family's past with these people (no, don't worry, never a chance of that!)? Would the truth ever come out?   And while I'm at it ...   Danger - multi-millionaires at large  I've always thought it was interesting that the mass murder of September 11 was allegedly committed by a multi-millionaire. We always say it was committed by a "terrorist" or by an "Islamic fundamentalist" or an "Arab", but we never define Osama by his rightful title: multi-millionaire. Why have we never read a headline saying, "3,000 Killed by multi-millionaire"? It would be a correct headline, would it not?   Osama bin Laden has assets totalling at least $30m; he is a multi-millionaire. So why isn't that the way we see this person, as a rich fuck who kills people? Why didn't that become the reason for profiling potential terrorists? Instead of rounding up suspicious Arabs, why don't we say, "Oh my God, a multi-millionaire killed 3,000 people! Round up the multi-millionaires! Throw them all in jail! No charges! No trials! Deport the millionaires!!"   Keeping America safe  The US Patriot Act and the enemy combatant designation are just a hint of what Bush has in store for us. Consider a brainchild of Admiral John Poindexter, an Iran-contra perp, and the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa): the "policy analysis market", which the government was to put up on a website.   Apparently, Poindexter reasoned that commodity futures markets worked so well for Bush's buddies at Enron that he could adapt it to predicting terrorism. Individuals would be able to invest in hypothetical futures contracts involving the likelihood of such events as "an assassination of Yasser Arafat" or "the overthrow of Jordan's King Abdullah II". Other futures would be available based on the economic health, civil stability and military involvement in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey. All oil-related countries.   The proposed market lasted about one day after it was revealed to the Senate. Senators Wyden and Dorgan protested the Pentagon's $8m request, and Wyden said, "Make-believe markets trading in possibilities that turn the stomach hardly seem like a sensible next step to take with taxpayers money in the war on terror." As a result of the uproar over this, Poindexter was asked to step down.   Giving Saddam the key to Detroit  In Las Vegas, an armoured fighting vehicle was used to crush French yogurt, French bread, bottles of French wine, Perrier, Grey Goose vodka, photos of Chirac, a guide to Paris and, best of all, photocopies of the French flag. France was the perfect country to pick on. If you're a cable news company, why spend priceless reporting time on investigating whether Iraq really does have weapons of mass destruction when you can do a story about how rotten the French are?   Fox News led the charge of pinning Chirac to Saddam Hussein, showing old footage of the two men together. It didn't matter that the meeting had taken place in the 1970s. The media didn't bother to run (over and over again) the footage from when Saddam was presented with a key to the city of Detroit, or the film from the early 1980s of Donald Rumsfeld visiting Saddam in Baghdad to discuss the progress of the Iran-Iraq war. The footage of Rumsfeld embracing Saddam apparently wasn't worth running on a continuous loop. Or even once. OK, maybe once. On Oprah.   © Michael Moore 2003.

      My screenwriting instructor wants me to submit my latest draft for the advanced directing students to maybe produce.  It'd be awesome to have something from this class get actually made.  I've updated the links to the side with "screenplay 2". I know, I know, I pull out all the stops when it comes to originality in title choices.  I'm actually thinking of calling it "All Apologies".  Lemme know if you think of a better name - even if that name is "pile of mindless boring fucking crap".

      I also updated the "Currently reading.." section to a link to The Filmmaker's Handbook.. probably the best book about the practicalities of making a film that I have found.  It's required reading for one of my courses, and I'm actually really glad.  So if you're interested in making film or video - read this book.

      Ok, I have a rare 30 seconds to spare, so here's the quick update - the good, the bad & the stuff that ain't got no alibi..    urlLink Andy  moved out at the beginning of the month.  It's a strange situation after four years of your life with someone to suddenly have a bed to yourself each night, to come home to an empty house.  While I love having that back, there's also a sense that something is missing.  But I'm so confident that the decision to split is the right one for now, that the sense of missing something goes away soon.  And I don't mean that to reflect badly upon Andy - it's just that I'm so sure that we have done the right thing.  I couldn't continue the way we were, arguing every five minutes.  I didn't like the person I had become, throwing out accusations become easier than thinking about the real issue at hand.  I finally took the time to think about the issues, and well... here we are.  I don't want to preclude the idea that there is no hope of Andy & rraaarr in the future, but - we'll just have to see.  Right now, I don't know what I want, and it's not fair to drag someone around while I make up my mind.  I even start a rideshare with someone new next week - someone who also works at my work and goes to my school.  I'll pay $15/week for petrol.  It's still cheaper than the train!   Anyway. On to bluer skies.   School has been keeping me busy - so busy that I hardly notice sleeping alone anymore!  I've nearly finished editing my first film.  Well, I have finished it, I just need to touch up some bad splicing here and there.  I put on the Academy leader backwards (you know, the stuff with the numbers that count down), so I need to fix that.  I shot my second film last Saturday night, and put the two rolls in for processing at  urlLink Columbia's lab  on Monday.  I'll probably pick it up next Monday.  I've had quite a few friends and family say they want to see the films.  It's pretty impossible since I shoot them on 16mm film, unless you have a projector.  But I'm thinking of maybe transferring all three projects from the semester onto VHS at the end of the year - maybe a good Christmas present for everyone? It depends on how much it is, but if anyone is interested, drop me a line.  I'm sure my email is on this blog, but just in case it's not.. click  urlLink here .  The films won't run more than 5 minutes in length.  My first is only about a minute to a minute and a half.    Going to Florida tomorrow.  There are many things that are good about this prospect, the least of which is not that it's warm in Fl and bloody cold here.  We had our first snow flurry last weekend.  Brrr.  For a kiwi girl from The Mount, Winter just isn't my bag, baby.  Y'know? The other good thing is, as I have mentioned before, meeting my best net friend, jd - after four and a half  years.  or something like that.  I met him in March 99 - just about the first time I ever chatted.  Andy is not too happy about the prospect, as you can imagine, but I've booked my flights now.  So, tough bikkies. I'm excited - but I have to maintain an apathetic indifference, just in case it doesn't turn out.  I think it will.  He told me online last night that his parents want to meet me.  Wierd.  I don't even think of him as having parents, least of all talking about me to them.  But I guess if some crazy kiwi girl is coming to visit you for a weekend, it maybe rates a passing mention to the olds when you go there to do your laundry.  Not that I can imagine jd doing laundry either.    The other thing I'm looking forward to in Fl - getting so fucking drunk I can hardly stand.  Yeah, I know, I'm still 17 at heart.  All I'm saying is that it's been too long since that has happened, and jd has promised me alcohol galore - among other things. And no, that wasn't a reference to sex-on-tap. :)  Back to school - My screenwriting class is really challenging me.  Which is good, because otherwise I'll just write a load of crappé.  If you want an example of such crap, see the "screenplay" link on the sidebar.  I'll probably put another one up there soon, that I like much better.  In fact, Screenwriting I is where I should be heading now.. so. Prolly should feed the cats first, but.

       auteurism   I made my first film last Saturday. Yay! We shot on B&W 16mm film, using Bolex's.    They're just short - about 1-2 minutes after editing.  I'm going to edit mine on Friday.. I can't wait to have it finished.  I shoot my second film -  a character study - next Sunday.    Andy is also moving out tomorrow.  So lots of new stuff for me.. I'll be on my own again for the first time in nearly four years.  I can't help but be happy because there's so much else in my life that I'm enjoying right now, that not even the thought of not having Andy to sleep with at night can bring me down.  I'm sure it will hit me later though.. after he's gone and it's too late to have him move back in.  It's his birthday next Friday.. he'll be 29 the old bastard.  I'm going to cook him a good pork roast, complete with crackiling - yanks don't know the wonders of crackling.  mmmm..... crackling....   I'm going to Florida in two weeks.. eek. That's about the scariest thing on my horizon.. I'll be meeting a friend from the internet for his birthday.  I've never met him, but we've "known" each other for 4 years or so.. longer than I've been with Andy, anyway.  Just never met face to face.  Maybe one day that'll turn into a film of mine. :)   grr. excited.. and not drunk enough yet.   btw - halloween costume party's are LAME.

      I'm currently buzzing and buzzing and buzzing about Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King (henceforth just ROTK).   I went to see it last night with Andy, after buying our tickets on  urlLink fandango  a month or so ago.  In a way, I really didn't want to see ROTK- I knew that at the end there would be no more to look forward to.  I've been anticipating these movies since 1998 when I first found out Peter Jackson would be making them in Wellington.  They so exceeded my expectations, especially as a Tolkein fan since back in the day (i'm so old school), and I've been made so proud to be a kiwi, and so proud of Peter Jackson and all that NZ has to offer.. and now it's finally over.  It's definitely a bittersweet thing.  Thank God for extended edition DVDs though!

       Take this Wright Bros   Up Yours Wright Bros *shakes arm wildly with middle finger raised*   I got two words for all you Wright Brothers believers -  urlLink Richard fucking Pearse .   My favourite paragraph is this:  Grid jostling aside, Pearse’s achievements might be remembered as even more remarkable in that, unlike the Wright brothers, who employed skilled engineers, and later enjoyed the luxury of government sponsorship, Pearse managed to get airborne from an isolated farm at the bottom of the world with no technical training and absurdly scant resources: relying on practical ingenuity and trial-and-error innovation to design, finance and build everything himself. Sheer achievement against the odds: a modern day Icarus from downunder who fashioned his wings not from feathers and wax, but from bamboo and scrap metal on his farm.

       Letter from Bahrain redux   My mum rocks.   Dear All  We’ve just broken up for our holiday and Al Hamdulillah (thanks be to God) that I ever chose to come to Bahrain. The people here just blow me away. I’ve received so many Christmas cards and presents from Moslem staff, friends and students, with many more wishing me Merry Christmas. I’ve trooped home in the last 2 days laden with more Xmas presents from students than I’ve had in the last 24 years combined.  We finished on a lovely note. Bahrain’s National Day is today, but we celebrated it at school yeasterday with many students wearing national colours (red and white) or traditional dress. Without exception the girls looked absolutely beautiful, and they had the grace to tell me how lovely I looked in the modest jelabiya I had bought for the occasion.  Here are some more unexpected observations:  Men think nothing of wandering round in lingerie shops, selecting underwear for their wives  The sexiest (tasteful) lingerie window displays I’ve ever noticed are here.  For Xmas I’m cruising down the Nile on a felucca. I leave for Egypt tomorrow. I’m hoping to meet up with an Australian friend in Cairo, as she begins a different tour on the same date.  Noeline  I had to find out what a felucca was, so here's a link with pics that prolly explains what Mum will be doing  urlLink Sailing Down the Nile on a Felucca

      YAY! I'm so excited.. everything's booked and confirmed for my trip back to good old En Zed.   So, the plan is.. work like hell until January 17 (fine cut of final film which I'm yet to shoot is due that day) .. Party like it's my birfday.. and then leave here on January 18.   Arrive Nadi, Fiji Jan 20 at an ungodly pre-dawn hour.  Get whisked away to my hostel and sleep for a couple of hours.  Get up - Perch myself equidistant from the pool and the bar.  Drink alcoholic beverages from vessels (hollowed out coconuts will do) that have little paper umbrellas in them, and slices of such fruits as pineapple.    Periodically, I plan on rolling (not walking, and  certainly  not running) to the pool.  And, as I have missed seeing the ocean, I will exert sufficient energy only to make my way to said ocean surrounding Fiji.  I will do my best to avoid coup leaders, and George Whatsisface.    After two days of that, I will be heading off to Auckland.. land of the sky penis, and  urlLink Tam I Am  for some boozing, so schmoozing and some shopping.. wow. I really wish there was a word for shopping that rhymes with booze and schmooze.   Then I'm off to visit home & friends in the Mount for more boozing and shopping.. then Wellies beckons me. Depending on the financial and time situation, I'd love to make it to the South Island, but who knows.. ??   Anyway.. I'm so excited!!

       Letter from Bahrain   I hope my mum doesn't mind me posting this (I'm sure she won't), but the last email I received from her was SO interesting, I decided that my blog was the perfect permanent home for it.   She's currently living in Bahrain, a tiny island in the Persian Gulf, next to Saudi Arabia.  She's there on a two year contract teaching at an international school of Western kids and Arabic kids.  She's going to spend Christmas in Cairo, Egypt.  I am way jealous.  My mum continues to be my inspiration.     Dear All  It is wonderful to start receiving all the Christmas emails, thanks.  I’m having a great time here in Bahrain.  Both locals and expats are so friendly.  We’re a nation of only 600,000 on a desert island but there is always an invitation round the corner.  Two thirds of the population is expat, with large numbers of Indians, Pakistanis, Philippinos, Thais and people from the ethnically European English speaking nations.  This means the business language is English.  The Bahrainis are mostly Arabs, but a large number are very proud of their Persian descent.  Until 200 years ago most were Persians.    The main entertainment here is eating and drinking, with food from all over in every price bracket.  It’s really nice to go to the upmarket hotels formally dressed, a real novelty for me.  I’m a member of the Australasian Club, which has a function once a month, but I’ve also made friends with locals, been to their homes and been out with them.  One good outing was to the annual jewellery exhibition, where jewellers from all over the world display.  Jewellery is loved and worn daily here, so many of the goods were equivalent to something that one would expect in the crown jewels.  A Bahraini woman needs a new set of jewellery for each wedding she attends. It was interesting to see these abaya-clad ladies pulling their already laden hands out and trying on rings worth thousands of dollars.  One man I know, middle class by Bahraini standards, bought his wife and daughter a necklace (an understatement) apiece: the first worth $NZ46, 000 and the second $23,000.    The Bahraini ladies are very beauty conscious though most seem to wear abayas when they are not working or not at a western or tourist venue.  They wear more makeup than we do, have immaculate and often designer clothing under the abayas, and the married ladies have body waxes every month to be hair free - and I'm talking about full body except head.  Their traditional clothes are beautiful - basically kaftans, with or without an extra garment with floating panels, in rich materials, beautiful colours and bejewelled, tasselled etc.  These are worn at traditional events and maybe in the home, otherwise it's western clothing.  And don't be fooled by the abayas - here many are expensive garments of beauty rather than the black sacks you see on the Afghan women, but I still would not like to wear one in summer.  The range of sexy underwear is no less than we have, and perfume is revered with both Arabic and western used in large quantities.  Flower arranging is a fine art.  Men wear traditional Arab garments or suits for business and work.    Some sights that have struck me as interesting and unexpected are:  *Abaya-clad ladies holding their partner's hand in public - rare and obviously in the forefront of change  *An abaya-clad lady sitting with a man's hand on her leg - and both are married to others - no Sharia law here  *Women walking alone at night, possibly exercising with running shoes and exercise clothes under flapping open abayas  *Men dancing very sexily with each other - at public "Arab" venues women are not allowed to dance, but there are many western venues, and I really haven't noticed if Bahraini women are dancing there or not.  Certainly the men who are are dancing with women.  Bahrain is said to be the most liberal of the places in the Persian Gulf, so that most women appear to be as free as in the west.  They certainly have astounding freedom to spend thousands of dollars a pop on jewellery they fancy and many have complete new wardrobes every year for them and their children.  I'm also told that when the husband complains that he can't afford it, the woman says they "have to have" whatever, and she is not at all concerned about the bank loans or financial stress her husband may be under.  It's his financial responsibility to support.  Many women hold responsible jobs, travel overseas alone and drive.  The first girls' school was opened in 1922, though most kids seem to be educated coeducationally.  Bahrain has little in the way of tourist sights, though its human history stretches back to the Dilmun civilisation of 5,000 years ago, and a substantial part of the old city has been excavated.  We are connected by a 25 km causeway to Saudi and the Saudis treat this as their weekend playground.  They drive here in droves, stay at the posh venues and do all the things they are not allowed to do at home.  This means the Bahrainis dislike them ("They are like animals") as they drive recklessly and often drunk so the road toll here is high.  This is also one of the contenders for the Garden of Eden site.  This is an Islamic kingdom, where religion is taken seriously, so that for the month of Ramadan, eating and drinking in public during the fasting hours is punishable by fine, regardless of religion.  Isa Town, where I work, translates as Jesus Town.  Reference to either Jesus or Mohammed is often followed by the words "Praise be upon him."  A couple of Moslems I know, and I'm sure most of the rest too, know far more about Christianity than the average western world "Christian".  You should have seen the shocked look when I was asked what i gave up for Lent and I said, "nothing."  Any Moslem can tell you that Christ's message was forgotten over 570 years and that another prophet was foretold in the Bible.  That prophet was Mohammed, who delivered the same message.  It is the divinity of Christ that is not accepted.  They say this was invented (the story that grew) by his followers, as the first known writing of Jesus's message was 60 years after his death, whereas Mohammed wrote down his message as he received it from God.    Moslems are not allowed to drink, but Bahrain provides every form of liquor outlet that we have in the west, right down to the Irish pub.  Last year there was a crackdown on the Moslems going in to the liquor stores: to make the stores less noticeable screens were erected outside them.  Now the Moslems drive behind the screens and toot until someone comes out to serve them.. I suppose the law relates to the building rather than the purchase.  There is no obvious anti-American or anti-Western feeling here.  In fact, there are 5,000 American troops living aboard a ship docked here, and many more living ashore.  One lady said, "We can't hate the Americans.  Many of our men have American wives."  Without exception, they are glad Saddam is gone but I can only guess at what they thought of the American-British offensive.  I know one Bahraini who approved: I certainly did not.  As in any country, some support the government, others do not.  Those who don't and who have expressed an opinion want democracy.    I can wear whatever I like and no one bothers me.  Bahrainis always tell us when we ask that we should wear whatever we are comfortable in, though some longterm expats say the Bahrainis are far too polite to tell us they would prefer more body covering.  However, I do notice everything from the body-hugging, latest fashion clothes to the abaya on mufti days.  For Christmas I am going on a tour of the Nile Valley and over to the Red Sea with a Canadian teacher I have met here.  I wish you all well at Christmas and a happy and prosperous 2004.  Christmas Mubarak.    Bev, how's your health now?  I often think of you and have been concerned.  Preece family, my love to you as always.  Sunday, when does your trip start?  Gail, I got your letter and card - thanks.  Colleen, let's hear about your Indian trip and Amy's year.  Lance, Darrell and Liz - Ish loonak, Salaam alaikom, marhaban and thanks for your card D&L  Mum, you're letting your email skills slip  Love to all  Noeline

        Things to be Excited about..   In no particular order..   - I've made two films so far this semester!!!   - I'm about to make the  piece de resistance  - a film about a guy spanking it to a phone sex line after his girlfriend leaves him (c'mon, I *had* to get a masturbation theme in   somewhere !) - funnily enough, my instructor (a bit of a square) was totally loving my storyboards, and even suggesting more stuff I could do.    - I just did a stint over the weekend PA'ing on my first feature film.  PA's - for the non-film geeks out there - are Production Assistants - basically bum boys & girls. We do the work (like getting coffee & tea) that everyone else is too busy and important to do.  I served a lot of food, which was good.. because then everyone associates me with yumminess. =)  Anyway, the film is called "Cup of my blood" - it's an indie horror I guess.  The only website I can find is  urlLink here , and it's not all that.  I'm hoping that I will get credited on this anyway.  It'd rock if it did well, but I don't know how good it is.  The cinematography looks great so far -but there's so much more that goes into a film.  I didn't like the lead male's acting - thought he kind of overdid it in the wrong places, and totally underdid it in others.  I haven't read the whole script - it's an interesting premise about a guy who has lost faith in God, but has the holy grail.  Anyway.. some parts of the dialogue are clunky.. but who am I to judge? a lowly PA.  Besides, when its all put together, it might be really good.  I don't care, it was just exciting all round.  It totally beat the other *big* production I PA'd on - a short called " urlLink Measureless to Man " that good old Mel Lynskey was in.    - I've lost ten pounds - maybe more!  YAY! going to the gym four times a week finally paid off.  I can *just* about fit into my old fave pair of jeans I haven't worn since I was 19.  Just ten more pounds and I'll be at my ideal weight (yeah, I'm a girl).   - I paid for my tickets to New Zealand!! I'm going home for three weeks in January!! I'm going to spend two nights in Fiji first (for under $6 US/night at a backpackers in Nadi).  The only exersise I plan on doing there is between the Pool, the Bar & the Beach!  At home, bring on the Milo, the Tim Tams, the Marmite - the beaches of Mount Maunganui (*sigh* home), the shops of Wellies, Island Bay, Wellington Library, the fresh sea air, good kiwi music and the bestest friends. Not to mention being able to order a Flat White in a cafe and not having people look at me like I'm speaking martian.  I'm SO excited. Drop me a line if anyone is interested in meeting up that I haven't already emailed.   - my free entry to  urlLink Crobar  this Friday night! I haven't been out to a club in so long, and I haven't been to Crobar since it re-opened in October.  I can't wait!    Things that aren't so exciting   - I kissed another boy in Florida (my friend jd - the one I went to see), and I told Andy about it, and understandably he was really upset.  We are over it now (still broken up though) but, I still feel bad about it.    - I found a lump on my breast.  I bet you all wanted to know that! Yeah, it's probably nothing.  I'm going to the Dr tomorrow to have it checked out, but it's still unnecessary worry.  Hopefully unnecessary.    - My complete and utter lack of money - my fucking fault for going part time to follow my educational dreams.. but it still sucks! Guess going out to Crobar is prolly not the best idea considering my lack of funds, but the free entry persuaded me, so nyah.   - Not having a bed-warming body in my bed at night when I go to sleep.  I kinda like star-fishing in bed, but I do miss that, when I have time to.

      I entered another phase of something or other today.. I made my first sell of stock. oo00oo. I sold HEW shares - all 49 of them - at around $30 a share today.  I was given most of them, and bout 25 at $19/share - so either way you look at it, it's a good deal.  i can't bring myself to look at  urlLink NYSE.com  though, in case the price went up really high right after I sold.  Or, on the flip side, it dropped a bucket and I only think I got $30, but really it was $0.30.   anyway, I'm financing my trip back to NZ with this money, so I hope it is enough..   I can't wait to go home.

      i'm still burning.. but this time on my tummy.  the sun in the Mount is just about as hot as in Fiji.. i had forgotten how quickly you tan over here.  Anyway.. i am doing my best impression of a Maori right now, with all my brown-ness.  :) I was tired of being pasty and white like a chicagoan anyway.    I'm off to wellington with my friend Blair for a few days on Fri which should be cool. I can't wait to see wellies again.  I've been filling up on avocados here.. My boss emailed me today and said that they had a mega snow storm in Chicago and people are taking 2-3 hours to get in to work. aahh.. i don't miss it at all!   i'm a bit incoherent at the moment.. and i'm already hitting the piss.. shh. it's not 11.30 in the morning!

      argh! i'm burning! well.. it's all a good kind of burn if you ask me.   I'm in an i/net cafe in Nadi at the mo.. it's my second day here, and i've managed to get burned, make friends, get drunk (as always), nearly pass out from heat, drink kava, snorkel around a coral reef and get hassled by like a million gazillion fijians trying to sell me their wares.  Anyway.. the fruit is fantastic here, as is just abuot everything else..   anyway. the connection is slow as fuck soi'll write more later when I'm nz. hopefully i can con a friend in to some free inet time for blogging.

      i hope he doesn't mind me posting this.. i didn't write the following.. it was written by a good friend of mine.. my best friend in the whole entire universe.  The one person who makes me feel real.   I just think he expresses shit well, but it might be because he expresses things that i just can't even put into words.   "Holiday Rejection"  Alone when everyone has someone, sitting by myself not caring about another year to fuck up, I live a day at a time anyway.. No resolutions, except to not make promises I don't want to keep. Billion dollar celebrations amount to nothing but drunken citizens escaping the thoughts of an industrial country turned corporate monster, giving up all our money to people who're so rich they could line their trash bins with my year's salary, diversions from problems that'll never be fixed cause we can't face deevolution.. there's no willlingness to sacrifice modern convenience for freedom. We keep the cycle alive, Jesus doesn't want to resurrect a decaying system based on greed. We are doomed to be slaves to ourselves, never speak up against anything obviously wrong or regressive..

      So, last night I get home from school at 9.45pm and the phone rings.  It's a groggy-sounding Andy on the other end.   "Hey", I say, "What's up?" "Did  urlLink Veronica  tell you? I was robbed today".  "Oh my god - when, w-where?" My mind's eye saw Andy held to knifepoint in a dark alley, being ordered to give over his wallet.  "At the bank" "What?!" My mind's eye saw Andy held to gunpoint while masked bandits ordered the staff and all the customers to give over their money.  "In Italy"  "Huh?"   Turns out, someone got a hold of Andy's bankcard info and charged $3,000US to his checking account.  He doesn't even have that much money in his bank.  They're going to credit it back to him, and so he won't be out of pocket at all, except for a couple of days in the meantime.  He gets paid on Friday, so he'll be ok.  He says the only time he's used the card online is through Paypal, which I doubt is how those crazy Italians got his card numbers.  Anyway. yeah.. those identity thiefs.. they're crafty.

       urlLink CNN.com - State high court may get same-sex marriage - Feb. 24, 2004   All I can say is kudos to the mayor who started this.  The Gay marriage thing seems to be coming to a head in the States.  Dubya is actually trying to amend the constitution to prohibit Gay marriage.  If the constitution is successfully amended so, then it means Gay marriage will never happen in the States, because then it would be considered "unconstitutional", and the Constitution is a sacred document to American law.  My mind boggles at how those who support amending the constitution as such fail to see that denying a group of people a right that is enjoyed by everybody else is against the basic tenets of "equality" which the Constitution apparently holds in such high regard.    Oh well. I'm leaving this godforsaken country in a year and a half.

      Ok, so Chicago is only 41 latitudes north of the equator, but close enough.   In my never ending search for  urlLink 42 Below  in the area (I fell in love with it my last trip back to NZ, but had to give away my ONE bottle that I was allowed to bring back through customs, to Andy since I didn't get him anything else as a present) I have discovered a couple of bars that serve it.  According to the East Coast rep, they're still positioning it in the market to be sold at wholesalers.  So, for now at least, in order to get this great tipple, if you are in the Chicago area, head to:   urlLink Le Bar  or   urlLink Naha   Swanky places, yes, but a swanky drink calls for swish surroundings. I'm heading out to Le Bar this weekend to order up some 42 Below drinks and drain the bank account quicker than it reached its present point.  I have told Andy he must dress in his best " urlLink Metrosexual " garb, and accompany me before our very non-swank trip to the Chicago Horror Fest, aforementioned  urlLink here   Anyway, there is some possibly exciting news in the pipes, but in the interests of non-jinxing anything, I'll keep quiet.  But it does have  everything  to do with this post.

      I've got... 3 hours (maybe less) to write another ten pages of my screenplay before the building closes today.  Considering the Press Photography seminar going on behind me (damn them and their interesting photos!), and the fact that I recognize nothing of what I wrote last night, and the screenplay is fast degenerating (who'da thought it could get  worse  than it already was), I'm betting I don't have much chance of getting it done.   But I'll take bets on that for money - or beer.

      Fun Subtle Revenge Tactic #1:  When writing a screenplay, make sure to name the especially unsavoury characters after real life people who have wronged you.  Better yet, make the character's exhibit similar traits to their real-life counterparts, then kill them off in really,  really  bloody ways.

      i've decided to wait to change my template until i actually have time to do it properly and get something i really like.. till then, this will have to do, because I'm  really  tired of the old one.

      *sigh* Why is writing so hard?   One of my classes this semester is screenwriting II, in which we are supposed to produce, by the end of semester, a full length screenplay for a feature.  While I am happy to have the motivation of not looking like a fool in front of the whole class and wasting my expensive tuition to get me to the final draft 6 and writing like a writing-maniac.. it doesn't mean anything that I write is any good.  At all.   God.  I just don't get fully formed idea's ready to transform into feature films in six easy steps.  Or 12, or 24. I'm somewhat familiar with my own writing process.  I will start off with an idea - usually a really bad one -  and pound away at it for a few weeks, re-shaping it into something somewhat decent.  At some point, inspiration will strike, and I will know that I'm on to a good thing, the story and the beats of that story will somehow finally become clear in my mind.  I can then sit down at the computer and in one fell swoop, write something that I can feel is pretty good.  Of course, there's fine tuning needed here and there.. I do have a tendency towards the cliche.  But overall, I will be able to keep the main structure of the story.    This time, however, it's been different.  I've been happy to trundle along, with no solid story line in my mind for these past six weeks of class, trusting inspiration to find me and fire me up.  It's just not happening though.  My second set of twenty pages are due on tuesday and I have No. Frigging. Idea of what to write.   I've been trying to build a story around a character, and maybe that's my problem there.  I started with a really strong sense of a character, but no sense of the situation.  Usually i go the other way round, or the character comes to me out of the situation, if that makes sense.  I don't pretend to be the greatest writer, or even a very good one, but I know that every now and then I write something that I  don't hate so much.  I kind of want to do that again, this semester.  Because it feels good to do that.  It feels good when the words start flowing.  It feels  good when the character comes alive to you, and it's like everything just unfurls, movie-like, in your heard.  One keystroke follows another, effect follows cause, and your story and images are laid out on paper, exactly how you imagined them.  Your story conveys your own personal themes and ideologies..   That's what I want to do.  Maybe I'll scrap everything I've written and start over again.  Maybe it's time to kill my children, so to speak, and start anew?

      Yeah *puffs out chest* I'm a kiwi.  aww. I'm so guldarn proud.   Actually, in a completely uncharacteristic move on my part, I totally forgot the Oscars were even on until about 8.45pm CST.  That might have had something to do with the recent binges of beer and jaegermeister that had permeated my weekend.. but probably not.  Anyway, I sat down to be thankfully relieved that I missed Blowfish-face Zellweger win her award.  God, what was  up  with her frou-frou piece of shit dress?   I actually had seen a record amount (for me) Oscar nom'ed films before the big day, this year.  I think the only main one's I hadn't seen were Seabiscuit (blech) and Master and Commander (blech, ich.. urgh - Russell Crowe is one kiwi the Aussies can have).  Bill Murray was my pick for Best Actor, but Sean Penn is deserving anyway.  As long as no one nominates Tom Hanks again. ever.   Of course I wanted Keisha to win for Best Actress, but I'd already resigned myself to the fact that she wouldn't, and I was happy for Charlize to win (yep.. i'm on first name bases with *all* the stars). I loved Diane Keaton's look... no matter how much Crow-face Rivers or whoever the "style-guru's" of the day might pan it.   Jack & Will were funnay.   My mum called from Bahrain as the Best Actor nom's were being announced.. we held our breath together as the Best Film nom's were announced, and then screeched together as Stevie Spieley quipped "it's a clean sweep".  Two little expat islands of excitement beaming out high-pitched babble into the airwaves.. (and that's just a regular day.. )  Fave Oscar-related links of the day (no, I didn't spend the whole morning scouring the net for "yay-NZ" related stuff.. )   urlLink E online's Best & Worst    urlLink Oscar Q&A's  (fun facts about NZ!)   urlLink CBS News - And the winner is...

      First draft screenplay due tomorrow..   So what have I done since I got home from work today?   I walked to Home Depot to buy spackle for the wall (see To Do list below), and stopped to take advantage of the offer at a local establishment of $5 pitchers of domestic beer (mmm.  urlLink Old Style ) and 25c wings.   Fucked around online, replying to e-mail, checking out my  urlLink roommates.com  profile (I'm "lakeviewnzer") and trying to solicit new unsuspecting people into my den of sin.. I mean, apartment.   Checked out Open Ops on the  urlLink Hewitt  website.    Looked, puzzled, at the handhelds on Franklin Covey.   I know, they're all items on my list (apart from the beer and wings.. ) but still..   Anyone know anything about PDA's worth letting me know?  Pretty much the only one I can afford is this  urlLink PalmOne Zire  handheld.     urlLink     I want to buy from  urlLink Franklin Covey  since I have a $50 gift voucher there, and it's not going to be use for much else. Anyway, I know I'm only, like, 5 years behind every one else in the world (I'm definitely can't afford to be an "early adopter" in marketing-speak), but anyway. It's my current dilemma.   Actually, no.  My current dilemma is that I need to pee, then try not to procrastinate any more and finish my fucking screenplay.

      Until I get a PDA, I'm going to have to take a page out of  urlLink Kiwifruit's  blog and do my to-do stuff here, because face it - who can keep track of the zillion pieces of paper I keep writing shit down on? I know I can't keep it in my head, but for fuck's sake, it's almost as much effort tracking down every scrap of paper I use.   So. Anyone who reads this will have to be bored (what's so different from usual, I hear you say.  Well, I don't see a gun to your head, so bugger off!)    To Do List     urlLink School   * Register for Summer Semester  * Apply with  urlLink The Devil Herself  for Summer loans  *Register for Fall Semester - can't do this till May 03.  *File for Special Circumstances Adjustment due to Lyn/Andy split and Full time to Part time work change.. (can't do this until divorce is filed)             -  Ask for letter from HR dept confirming change of hours  (My HR rep said she'd interoffice it to me by end of business tomorrow) *Misc. homework             -  Finish the fucking first draft of the screenplay - Tonight!  Yeah! wooho!  -  Meet with Lauren to rehearse scene for Saturday .    Divorce  (ugh) * Call Clerk of Court to find out paperwork to fill out  * Find out Andy's new street address  and update paperwork * Call  urlLink Gerard  to find out if his name & Attorney info needs to be on the paperwork .  If not, do I need to fill out an Appearance for myself as well as filing one for Andy? * Go to DMV to register car in Andy's name only - do this Mon May 3 so I can pay the $65 fee.  * Ask andy to try to re-fi the car in his name only  * Open a new checking account for bills at my bank  *Close the Joint Cheque account at TCF Bank (need Andy to be there) *  Give  urlLink the gym  my new cheque acct info for monthly dues.  *File paperwork at Clerk of Court! (50 S. Washington, Rm 802)    urlLink Work   * Get approved for temp schedule change  so I can go to school during the Summer and get  urlLink Production II  out of the way.  * Get approved for a temp schedule change during end of May when Andy is on holiday, so that I can take public transport to work.  * Check out Open opportunities within the company for the Chicago office.  I  hate  commuting to the suburbs.    flatmate looky-findy stuff  * Since Veronica is moving out, I need to  call the landlord and find out what they need if a prospective flatmate is interested in the apt . -  Tell Veronica she needs to write a letter to Parliament  (landlord Co.) telling them she's leaving and wants off the lease, and her share of the Security deposit back. Sign it.  -  Get tenant applications from Building Manager, Tom .  - Write my own letter to Parliament stating that I'm ok with change in flatties. etc.  *  Get spackle etc  for the huge hole in the wall left by Andy when he left.  Now just spackle the damn hole . (thanks jd)  *  Ask landlord to repaint the bedroom in preparation for new flatmate moving in.    Most importantly...   Get completely, utterly sloshed .    Ok, I think thats about it for now.  I will probably think of more later and update it.   At least now I don't have to worry about where I last wrote it down, and I can kind of figure out my progress.   Shit, I have a lot of crap to do.

       urlLink this is my hat  I bought it yesterday because I'm a completely trendy cunt. Or I like hats. Whatever.  So anyways, I'm forcing you to like this band: The Mannequin Men. You may be asking.. "Oh jd, why do I now instantly love them? Did you use voodoo on me?" Well a guy in the band (I didn't get his name) works at a record store I frequent, and he's nice as fuck to me. He tips me off on some good music and he's never pretentious or anything even though he's known a lot of shit about other shit that I wouldn't have thought he'd have known. Yeah. Anyways, I now have two videos of Stitches songs because of this unsung hero so you will now fucking love his band. I'm going to go see them June 8th whether you care or not. $2 cover and drinks. Fucking rock on unsung heroes of the world. And I especially don't mean fucking firemen.

           Ahhh, I actually have my own blog somewhere, not that i know where it is or even what it's called or how to get into it, so this, besides my little unread notebook, is my new forum for whining or bitching or whatever it is that I do that makes people despise me. That was not exactly relevant to anything at all, but I felt the need to alienate anyone who reads this with personal and inside knowledge that they would never understand (much less understand why I took the time to mention it).       So I've been on this faux "health" kick lately which has done me absolutely no good in that I still have a large beer belly and feel shitty about myself as compared to all the slim chic looking gay guys strutting around here.       I've now found a job though, not that you even may have known I was unemployed, or that I even existed, and it's pretty shitty, but I'm really sick of looking for jobs and whoring myself out in that fake "yes, I AM good with people" presentation so I'm going to at least live with it till my first check, maybe in the mean time I'll find some inspiration to actually email my resume out to prospective employers.       I feel particularly unimportant here, which can be good, and bad, seeing as I have one friend and if we fight then I have nothing else to turn to, which at times seems as though it could lead to disaster, but, oh well, fuck it. I've been thinking about being homeless alot, like, what would I do? How would I stay warm, how would I eat, etc. Some times it doesn't seem so hard, it's just the whole having a place to actually lay down and sleep thing that bugs me. I don't know why I think about it so much, actually, I do, but I won't tell any strangers because I'm ultimately scared of pretty much everything, including criticism or even advice.      So, otherwise, life isn't utterly horrible, and to here everyone else tell it, I'm extremely lucky. I don't feel that way though, being lonely and turning lazy, becoming bankrupt, though I'm not exactly too far away from the point I was before I moved. I guess I'm sort of always this way, I'm "dysfunctional" emotionally, I just think I'm a pessimist, or at the most extreme, completely out of my mind.

      Having not lived here long, I don't exactly know where the post office that would be holding my last paycheck ransom would be located... so I go off in search of said ultimately important money and property.. which turns out to be a huge fucking waste of time. The online address of a postal annex "near" me is actually a Marshall's (I think) and the post office my girlfriend sends me to has in fact, moved. So, once I call the one that "moved", they say I have the wrong fucking store in the first place (I figured that out already via insight into beaurocracy, why would the one closest to me serve me?). So anyways, I call the one they tell me to call, who then says I once again have the wrong place, and promptly hangs up on me. So after calling the hotline (which I probably should have done in the first place), who tries to refer me to the previous location, and some explaining that they just told me to fuck off, I finally get the right office, and after talking to 3 different people, whilst holding 5 minutes in between every new voice, they tell me there's no mail for me, take my phone number, and that's about it. Dude, fuck it.  --posted by jd.

      I received an email from an old.. "acquaintance" on the weekend...  The Backstory..   Back in my first year of Uni, in 1998 (omg, pre-2K), I was introduced to Dan by a mutual friend of ours who lived in the hostel ( urlLink Victoria House ) I stayed at.  He was, apparently, quite interested in me after only one meeting.  A strange phenomenon for me at the time, because I didn't tend to think of myself as the type who made impressions on people after only one meeting.  Anyway, he asked me out on a "date" and we went to the movies (I think we saw Saving Private Ryan.. or was that another time?) and hung out at  urlLink The Matterhorn  before he took me home and cooked me an amazing meal.  If there was one good thing about Dan (and even I can admit there was more than one good thing about him) it was his cooking. Wish he'd done it more often for me.  Anyway, can't remember what time I got home that night, but it was probably sometime the next day...   Things went from there. We were never really "going out", but we spent a shitload of time together.  He was generous with his money, took me out to nice restaurants, bought me nice things.. When we had fun together, we had a LOT of fun.. but those times kind of got fewer and farther between after a while.  I was 18 and not really into having a full-time boyfriend.  Dan did a lot of things to me that really aggravated me, and I know I was a bitch back.    This one time, he was producing a short film -  urlLink Measureless to Man  (yay! my name is on IMDB!)and he offered me a chance to help out as Production Assistant.  During Pre-Production, we had a big fight - I can't remember what about - and he "fired" me.  So I went home, and forgot about the production meeting that was scheduled the next day for 5pm or so.  At 5.10 I get a call from Dan asking me, incredulously, why I wasn't at the meeting.  Goddammit, you just fired me - that's why I'm not at your bloody meeting!! Anyway, on that shoot I crashed the director's car driving in the Wairarapa.  Fun times.    But on the other hand... he ran into me once at New World and - knowing I was a poor student who was almost broke - bought me a whole lot of groceries.   So, all I can say is it was a surprise to hear from him.  I haven't talked to him since shortly after that film.  I ran into him outside of The Matterhorn another time, but he was with Jono Rotman (dunno how I remember all this) and kind of blew me off.  I can't blame him, really.  I heard from a friend of his that he'd moved to Australia and then heard nothing more...   But really, all the anger and everything I felt about him has gone now. I realised that when I was reading his e-mails.  And as I read about how he's got a script that's sold and the other things that he's doing, I started remembering all the good things about him.. his generosity, his good cooking and our shared passion for film, the nights I spent at his apt on Garrett Street, watching Lost Highway (over and over..).   I realised that I really felt genuinely happy for him, and hopeful that things work out for the best for him, his girlfriend and his dog.

       urlLink MSN  has both the following stories.   First the "aww.."   In less happy "Buffy" news, a former member of the Scooby Gang is battling some post-Sunnydale demons. Nicholas Brendon, who played cutie quipster Xander Harris during the show's seven-season run, revealed this week he's seeking treatment for alcohol abuse.   "After realizing that I had a disease that was taking control of my life, I decided that the best way for me to regain my health was to enter a treatment facility," Brendon candidly announced. "Over the past eight years I've discovered that Buffy fans are the most caring and supportive fans in the world. Knowing that they will be behind me, rooting for me as I go through this process, makes everything that much easier. I'm looking forward to leading a happy, sober life."   Is it not enough that he had to lose an eye?!?!  Now the eww.. well, not necessarily ew, but each to their own, I guess.    Ready for the gossip equivalent of gulping down the red pill? The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Larry Wachowski, co-creator (with his brother Andy) of the "Matrix" trilogy, is preparing to undergo a sex change operation.

      Some of you may have gathered (if you were insanely bored and actually read my To Do list.. ) that I am currently looking for a new Flatmate.  Veronica is moving out.    Anyway, this puts me in the entirely awkward position of having to talk to people I don't know, don't care about and don't particularly like, and try to seem  nice .  I have to seem to care if they live with me or not. Stroke their ego's like that of a fading star "You're still the one. You're still popular.  What do you mean, you haven't had a hit in 10 years? The world's just not ready for  you ".   But you do get to meet some ... types. Take for instance the two calls I had over the weekend.   Call #1 from "Mr. Sex-ay"  Mr. S - "So I've just moved to Chicago from Miami, where I was a model" Lyn - "Mmhmm"  Mentally ticks the "not sure how I feel about that" column  Mr. S - "And I'm used to a laid back lifestyle in Miami". Lyn - "Laid back is good". Mr. S - "Really laid back".  Lyn - "I'm from New Zealand, we invented laid back" (albeit with some jandals, a builder's crack, a stubby of DB Brown and the rugger.. prolly not "Miami Model" laid back..) Mr. S - "No. REALLY laid back." Lyn - "Ok, I'm laid back." (Thinking: "Dude, for someone who's so concerned about being laid back, he's kinda uptight") Mr. S - "As in, I like to walk around the house naked". Lyn - (gulps) "uhhh.. Ok". (me? living with a naked male model? I'm sorry - did my ship just come in, cuz I don't see a boat)  So anyway.. the conversation progresses, and we're in the middle of describing the way we look (I'm thinking this is all way too Internet-datey) so that we can meet at a local and have a drink before he see's the apartment.  (Am I getting asked out by a potential room mate who's never met me?) I mention that my friend Jd will be there.  Here the conversation picks up..   Mr. S. - "Are you seeing him?" Lyn - "Yeah, I guess... why?" Mr. S - "Then I'm going to have to rethink this.  I'm sorry, but I've lived with girls before where their boyfriends or whatever had jealousy issues over me, and I don't want to deal with that again." Lyn - "wtf?" Mr. S - "I just don't want to get myself into a situation again.  I'm going to have to think about this".  Lyn - "Dude. I just want a roommate". (Not a fuckbuddy)  Ok, so it appears that Mr. Sex-ay thought that flatting means fucking. I don't know.  I heard back from him at 11pm last night, but he'd forgotten he'd already talked to me.  Asked me again if I was ok with him being naked, like "75% of the time". I kid you not. I told him it was fine, but he'd probably get cold and would be in danger of getting something delicate scratched by my cats at some point.   I may save the other conversation for another day. I have to go and pretend to work again now.

      Because if I had a decent broadband connection, I wouldn't have to wait for my winamp to buffer the  urlLink stream  from  urlLink 95 bFM  every five fucking seconds.    Thanks to  urlLink Tam  for reminding me that it's New Zealand music week or month or something, in New Zealand.  This, in turn, reminded me that this week, bFM would be  playing kiwi music 24/7.   While Tam may be kiwi-music'ed out, I don't get nearly enough.  In fact, it's so bad, that when I heard "Don't dream it's over" at Starbucks the other day, I got all misty eyed.  Good old Neil.

       urlLink    Pride, baby. &nbsp; urlLink     What has more bare arse than a stripper convention, more bad techno than boy racers on a Saturday night in Palmerston North and more ugly old people than the local RSA?  Chicago Gay Pride of course!   Once again, it was a stellar year for Lynda. The drinking started at approximately 1.30 pm when JD purchased a pint of rum and distributed it evenly between myself and him with about an ounce of coke to 'dilute' it between us.  In the hot sun with empty stomachs, that quickly translated to much obnoxiousness by the both of us, which I think was encapsulated by myself yelling the title of this blog to the marchers for the  urlLink Naked Juice  float.  I'm sure they'd  never  heard that one before. Anyway. Kendra and Kate showed up shortly after the parade, and we headed over to Halsted to hang out by the 7-11 parking lot and be even more obnoxious to passers-by.    Needless to say, we nearly got our asses kicked more than once, and ended up leaving about 6.30.  At which point we crashed out to sleep and I woke up about an hour ago with the biggest case of dehydration ever.     urlLink    Shake it like a polaroid picture&nbsp; urlLink     The best floats were: The Red Eye/Metromix float (picture above is of their float for '03),  The Altoids float (as usual),  The Dykes on Bikes.. (not technically a float, but as the guy next to me remarked.. there's just something about a chick on a powerful bike.. )    Highlights: Seeing an offical looking Police-Chiefy type speeding down Broadway on a Segway.  I'd never actually seen one for real before.   Seeing a newly married Gay couple all en-hotpants-ed press foreheads and noses together like the blatantly in love people that they were.   Low points: All the fucking political candidates parading, and blatantly pandering to the "gay vote". I'll maybe give them some respect for parading when I finally see  urlLink Barack Obama  parading in drag, complete with red patent leather fuck-me boots and a beehive wig.    urlLink John Kerry  campaigners handing out "out loud for Kerry" and other such propaganda stickers at Gay Pride.  He's not for Gay marriage, so what business does he have campaigning in a Parade about equal rights for Gays?  Best freebie was (sadly): The Red Eye fan with the sticker that I put on it that said "Bush - you're fired!".  That or the Pride 2004 lollipop I got.   Best part of Pride this year: Standing in line for the portaloo with a million gay men (people - don't poo at Pride.. it's just not right) and drinking strange people's alcohol.   Woohoo. Yeah, Shake it for Gay Pride!

      Where should I start? It's only been two point five weeks, and I already loathe him.  I think that he exaggerates stories he tells for dramatic effect.  He's overly negative He seems bitter and is probably projecting that on to us, his students I don't entirely trust his knowledge.    urlLink Production II  is my last required course at  urlLink Columbia , then it's just electives all the way.  We're again making short 16mm films, but this time we're shooting colour negative, with post-sync sound (as opposed to  urlLink Prod I  where we shot B&W reversal with no sound).  Anyway.   In one of said teacher's long, drawn out spiels to us about making sure we have our Columbia paperwork with us whenever we shoot in public, he told us this story.  Some kids were shooting on the South Side, where they were inadvertantly shooting near a drug bust.  The cops who busted the people asked if the Columbia kids were involved with them, and told no, left them alone and drove away.  Along comes another cop who asks for the paperwork, and upon not having any with them, takes the camera, busts it on the ground then hands it back.  Now, I'm sure there was a grain of truth in this, and I'm not one to defend authority figures (especially the Chicago PD) but I don't think this happened exactly.    Second point.  He's overly negative.  Ok, we get it.  It's hard to get a job in the film industry, even if you go to film school, especially if it's Columbia which is not even rated anywhere near the top ten film schools (probably because of it's open admissions policy, but who knows and who cares).  So, thanks for the dose of realism, I don't want a teacher who blows smoke up my arse about everything being rosy, but we're attending school there for a reason.  Get over it, it's not your job to discourage us.   Third point. You're bitter and I get it that the one feature you made will never be released because the producer won't finance a transfer back to film for release, but that's not our problem.  Thanks for the headsup on your experience, but now.. lets move on.  And see point two.   Third point - I don't trust his knowledge.  I know my basic lighting stuff, having just taken and passed well a Lighting I class.  That class uses more advanced lighting than we'll need in this Prod II class.  But somehow, my teacher is fucking that up too.  For example, colour negative film has around 7 stops of latitude (depending on the stock, blah blah).  This means that you have about 3.5 stops either side of your exposing stop before the brightest and darkest areas of the frame have no discernable detail in them.  Mr. Teacher Man told the class that it meant you have 7 stops either side.  If he's fucking up shit I know about, then that's all good.  But we're supposed to be learning about sound and a whole lot of other stuff I don't know about, and I'm not going to be able to trust what he tells me.  And apart from that, he is like the worst person ever at explaining stuff, and can't stay with a topic or organize a lecture for shit.   *breathe*. GRRR.   Anyway. My latest objects to covet..    urlLink Avid Xpress Pro  for students (there's like a $1400 Savings!)   urlLink Movie Magic Screenwriter 2000  (so I don't have to use a cracked version anymore. sshh! secret squirrel.    urlLink Apple Powerbook  to run my Avid Xpress on.    urlLink American Cinematographer's Manual for film & Video  Not that I want to be a Cinematographer, but it's still handy to have if you plan to make your own film's at some point.    urlLink scr(i)pt magazine  subscription. I devour these things. I wish they came out every month.    urlLink creative screenwriting  ditto.    urlLink Spotmeter  I'll never win the auction though.   That's about it for now. *sigh*. I wish I had unlimited reserves of money. Donations will be happily accepted.  I'll even credit you in my Golden Globe acceptance speech if you want.  (Oscar speech is reserved for my Mum, my Agent and my fans.. )   edited to add  I also want this  urlLink DV camera .   I'm just crying out for a generous benefactor/sugardaddy.

      I just watched the E! true hollywood story of Ellen Degeneres. It's basically an hour of jacking off her lesbianism. The coming out episode was hailed as "landmark" which is rediculous considering most people realize by now that t.v. is bullshit. A landmark t.v. episode would include the complete mocking of the viewers followed by alienation from any sponser. Also, the "downfall" that she experienced due to her coming out via tv and anne heche or however the fuck it may be spelled is irrelevant. The show fucking sucked at that point. And her bitch going out with a dude a couple of weeks after being found wandering around a cornfield professing to be god or something.. well, welcome to every guy that does drugs' plane of existance. Note to Ellen. Never love a bitch cause a bitch is a ho. Thank you Cleveland, Good night.

      Yeah, so I finally got a copy of  urlLink L.A.M.F.  No fucking disappointment here, whatsoever, "Chinese Rocks" rapidly usurped "Born to Lose" as my favorite song.. And I also decided that I want to live up to my email and be a trashy thrasher, so I'm in the process of buying a guitar, It's an  urlLink Epiphone Les Paul Special II , it's only $150, but I'm like dead ass poor... and I'm really glad Lynda is understanding that I wanna be a rocker. So yeah, anyways, You all (whoever you are) actually fucking missed out. The Mannequin Men, as I suspected, fucking rocked all 30 people there. The guy (I forgot his name) sings alot about sex, but he kicks it in so much overdrive it's amazing. I was impressed. Paris, Texas, however, fucking sucks. And I didn't stay for Bang! Bang!, which I kind of regret, but Lynda had already left, and blah blah, so on and so forth. Anyways, I've stumbled onto this thing, ripping the movies off of cd's with bonus shit... it's not exactly revolutionary or even techinically hard, I'm sure, but still, the movies play more regularly and I could send them to people, if I felt the need. Wow my life is boring. Oh, yeah, The manager of Einstein Bagels asked if I wanted to be a shift manager, which is wierd, because there's more people there who've been there longer and I think are better at it than me, they're just less reliable. Whatever. I'm gonna say yes and hopefully make more cheese, so I can pay off my much neglected celly bill.

      Mojito recipe  3 fresh Mint sprigs 2 tsp Sugar 3 tbsp fresh Lemon Juice 1 1/2 oz Light Rum Club Soda  In a tall thin glass, crush part of the mint with a fork to coat the inside. Add the sugar and lemon juice and stir thoroughly. Top with ice. Add rum and mix. Top off with *chilled* club soda (or seltzer). Add a lemon slice and the remaining mint, and serve.   Well, Technically I'm on phase one of the  urlLink South Beach Diet , which prohibits alcohol for the two weeks it lasts.  Supposedly, I can then add it back in "very limited" quantities (except for red wine).  But to that, I say a hearty "Bah!".  No one and no diet is going to come between me and my cheap alcohol.    I have been on phase one of this diet since last Sunday.  Tuesday began my downward spiral as jd and I went to  urlLink The Metro  to see the Mannequin Men (no band site exists as far as I can tell) and there were $2 beers.  Although I did not partake of the extra carbohydrates contained in the beer, I did permit myself a Vodka gimlet.  My rationale being that lime juice is allowed in Phase One, and adding two shots of vodka to that ain't  so  bad.  Anyway.  I think I've had a gimlet every night since then.  And tonight, I've partaken of the devilicious gimlet, raspberry mojito and a wee tequila cocktail at my  urlLink local .  Not too much in keeping with the whole philosophy of  urlLink Dr. Agatston , but who the fuck cares? I'm twenty fucking four.  Too young to be curbing my copious intake of alcohol at this point.    Anyway. On another point.  Everywhere else has a fucking  urlLink Tornado Warning  except for Chicago.  Damn us. We just get lots of rain and "Severe thunderstorm warnings" that produce only mildy mentionable thunderstorms.  Personally, I say bring on the death and destruction, just as long as my home and friends and self are left unharmed. :)

      But for some reason, this  urlLink NZ Herald  story put a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.     "Mr Coleman was given a glass of 'the best red wine I've ever tasted' before a vast cavalcade pulled up and President Chirac stepped out.  'He came over ... I snapped to attention and gave him a little salute ... he put his arm round me. He said he would be happy for me to travel in one of the aeroplanes and gave instructions that I was to be driven to the door of my hotel in Paris.' "

      Yes, So, the Belmont Street Festival was this weekend, and  urlLink The Von Bondies  played. Lynda and I mistakenly thought they were playing Saturday night, but they weren't "Smile Empty Soul" or some bullshit was. Anyways, So we went on the day we kicked off the alcohol abstinence marathon, which actually really didn't affect a thing. It's wierd how the first real concert I've been to since I've been of legal drinking age was a sober one. Oh well, I have to admit, the fucking VB's rocked it... Lynda bought thier CD the other day to see if it would be worthwhile to go... ah yes, I neglected to mention the show was free too. Anyways, Ole Jason Stollsteimer (sp?) rocked it. The sound was pretty much searing, straight forward rock, man, it was fucking great. It was great to see some old drunk cubs fan dancing next to me and the hardcore punk kids even giving it up to them and having some fun. The drummer, Don something or other... played like he was trying to beat a rhino to death or something, he was going apeshit, and still hitting every beat. The bass player even threw in some nice little solos and the two girls singing together sounded rather harmonic, a fucking great antidote to the pop show shit we went to and basically just left the floor to go sit at the bar.

       urlLink Ananova  reports:   A German couple who went to a fertility clinic after eight years of marriage have found out why they are still childless - they weren't having sex.   Anyway.  Things for me have finally quieted down a bit.  Last week was my last week of the semester.  I called in sick to work for three days, and since I only work three days a week, ended up with nearly two weeks off work (Monday was a public holiday here).  That was plenty of time to finish the second draft of my screenplay, finish the script and flow chart for the game I wrote, write my four page paper on Lighting and slack off as usual for Acting.  Oh yeah, and Drink.  So anyway, everything's finished and I'm happy as larry.    Saturday was my last class, then that night I had some friends over because my friend Kendra turned 21 last week.  It was my obligatory duty as just about the only person over 21 that she knows to take her out and show her a good time.  A few hours and a depleted bank account later, that was pretty much achieved.    Sunday I spent a well deserved day in bed, watching E's urlLink 101 Most Shocking Moments in Entertainment  (and being disappointed that I watched all that to find out that stupid OJ's car chase was #1 - what an anti-climax) and DVD's.  It was great. Fanfuckingtastic.   My old roommate Veronica finally moved out.  Thank fuck for that.  Bad blood that I'm tempted to post about, but really I'm in too good a mood right now to pay it any mind at all.   I have my court date for the divorce finalisation thingy tomorrow.  If all goes well, I'll be a 24 year old divorcee this time tomorrow.  Definitely wierd.  Andy and I still hang out and get along, so it's all good.    Next week the madness starts again though.  I'll be working Monday, Wednesday & Friday, then taking a summer class Tues & Thurs through to the end of August.  I'll be shooting with post sync sound this time, so that should be fun and new and interesting and all that stuff.   I'm planning on writing at least two more screenplays over summer too, for my Screen Treatment and Presentation class in the Fall Semester.  One is going to be a short loosely based on The Great Flatmate Hunt, the other is a feature based on one of a couple of ideas I have lying around in my head right now.     yeah.  Where would I be without the madness?

      Hey everyone,   In case I haven't given any of you the update in a while, things are going.. ok.. I guess.   The divorce between Andy & me is final sometime this week.  Eek, I can't believe I'm a divorcee at 24 years old.  But it is all for the best, and I just hope I've learned from the past! Andy & I are still good friend - better than about the last year of our relationship, anyway.  We still work at the same company, so he drives me in on the days I work.    I'm still going to school at Columbia for film.  My main focus has changed from directing to screenwriting though.  I've really found that writing is so much more natural to me, but I know that Directing will always be in the back of my mind.  I think it will be much more of a natural transition to directing if I have a solid base in the craft of story-telling anyway.    I recently shot my 5 minute film project for my Production II class at columbia - the last required class for my  major.  It actually went a lot better than I expected - and it helped me realise that I don't want to give up on directing altogether.  In previous classes, the films we have made have been products of our sole efforts - so I've had to fulfil the role of lighting, camera, set design, producer, director all at once.  This film was much more collaborative, although it was definitely MY film.  But I did have another class member do the camera, and a friend did the sound, while I focused mainly on directing.  The little girl who acted in the film, Kayla - a friend's daughter - was awesome, a real natural.  I couldn't have been happier.    I'm also planning on making a documentary at the end of the year in the UK.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm in the very earliest stages of pre-production on that.   I'm spending about 10 days in the UK with mum over xmas, and then about a week in Bahrain to see where she lives.  It'll be my first time in the Middle East - naturally I feel some apprehension, but Mum assures me Bahrain is safe and very friendly to westerners.  I'm just going to make sure I travel there on my NZ passport, not my British one. Keep your fingers crossed for me, because I am flying British Airways.  We're also hoping to get over to France via the Chunnel for a day or two.  I can't wait.  I've got the best mum ever - she's paying for the whole lot!   I can't wait to get back to NZ though.  My trip there recently was amazing, and just made me realise all sorts of things, including the knowledge that my heart never left NZ.  I can't think of a place I'd rather be in the entire world than there.  I need to get travel out of my system though, and so it might be around the end of 2005 before I'm actually back for good.  I need to see the world.   Well, I can't think of much else that's going on these days.  It's finally warm in Chicago again, and that's welcome.  I hate moving though, and it's supposed to rain today.  Chicago has the most erratic weather ever.   Ok, well if I forgot to include anyone on this email, pass it along for me.  And keep in touch.  :)   Lots of love,   Lynda

      Article's involving NZ in the international press.   Most  of these make me proud to be a kiwi.    Israeli Passport Scam    The important aspect was that the Government stood up for itself, denounced Israel, demanded an apology and swiftly dealt with Howard's reaction.   From  urlLink Sydney Morning Herald   Even the Aussie's are giving us kudos in this.  I think old Hel's acted well in this case, and am right proud to be a kiwi.  We'll show them Frenchies and them Israeli's (and anyone else who tries it on) that we might be a small country, but we're sure as fuck not an easy target.   See also  urlLink Haaretz  on Hamas' endorsement of NZ's stance on the issue (not that we wanted the endorsement of extremists), and this  urlLink CBC  coverage of the grave desecrations in NZ.  This is definitely one I'm NOT proud of. Bloody fools.    International Whaling Commission    urlLink Reuters  reports:   New Zealand has tabled a non-binding resolution expressing concerns over how whales are killed. It has a fair chance of passing since, unlike legislative measures, it only needs a simple majority.  While Japan tries to pass a resolution allowing the return to large-scale commercial whaling.    Floods 'n' Quakes   As well as the usual plethora of local media, events in my home county of B.O.P. (Bay of Plenty) have even made it into  urlLink CNN , albeit not on the home page.  It's kind of funny seeing Opotiki mentioned on CNN.    Civil Defense workers maintained a state of emergency across the region Monday as floodwaters up to a meter (3 feet) deep poured through the streets of several rural towns including Opotiki, Edgecumbe and Whakatane.  The Rugger    urlLink The Guardian 's report on NZ winning the Bledisloe Cup for the first time in seven years. Or something.   "There's a real feeling of pride," Tana Umaga, the All Blacks captain, said. "The cameras are out, the boys are sitting around the trophy, they are pretty happy." They are but a snapshot of their nation's content.  Did I ever mention I met Tana once?  Well, I did.

      So I guess Stephen Hawking is losing a bet based on his own research. Basically, some other super-nerd challenged his theory that all information is destroyed in a black hole, never to be  recovered. For losing the bet, he is giving the other guy an Encyclopedia of his choice, from which information can be recovered at will. Other cool bet's he's lost were that black holes didn't exist (he sent the winner a subscription to Penthouse) and something about nakedness, in which he bought the winner some clothes. He's supposed to be smart, but I wouldn't take this guy to Las Vegas with me. Except may to bet against him.    Anyway,  urlLink The New Scientist  and   urlLink Discovery  (for laymen - read: idiot - like me) can explain it better than I can.    Here's an  urlLink essay  I wrote last summer for my Astronomy Gen Ed class.  Re-reading the essay, I feel kinda like the guy, Charlie, in urlLink Flowers for Algernon  when his IQ is going back down and he reads his own research.  It's like I can't even comprehend what I wrote.    Anyway, I'm a geek.

      Yesterday, two cool things happened. Or kinda happened.  Whatever.    The first thing is that I finally got inspiration for my 5 minute short film project for this semester.  Originally I was going to adapt  urlLink Lamb to the Slaughter  by Roald Dahl, but I decided that I wouldn't be able to adapt it for less than a 10 minute film, when our limit is 5 mins.  So I was struggling for ideas, starting to worry as the deadline for our pre-production approaches, when yesterday - on the train to school - I had an epiphany.  Literally, it was like a light going on in my head.  So I have the perfect idea and totally know who I can get to act in it, and I pretty much know how the script will go before I've even written a word.  Damn, that's good. My friend Blair is going to do original music for me, too.. so if it's anywhere near good enough to enter festivals, I won't have to worry about getting rights for any music.   Second thing is that I finally went in to the  urlLink Doc Center  at school yesterday and chatted with a couple of instructors about the Documentary I want to make over christmas.  They were both really enthusiastic about it and said things like "dynamic" and "passion" and "potential" about it. That makes me happy.  So I guess I'm officially on the road to making my doc.  My instructor for Doc I next semester is going to hook me up with a Grad student that might be able to help out, but said I shouldn't have any difficulty finding people to help, since it would be a great project for other documentarians to work on. So, yay for me!

      Supposedly it's independence day.  All I care about is that I get a day off work tomorrow.  Spent the day "celebrating freedom" by napping and then cooking up some food on the bbq.  I'll be making my bookings for my trip to the UK and Bahrain soon.     Anyway.. here's an excerpt from my Mum's latest email.  Needless to say, I'm seething with jealousy. I mean, it's not like she deserves it or anything. ;)    I spent one night in Rome.  Looked at the  urlLink Colosseum  and  urlLink Palatine Hill  then on to  urlLink Polignano a Mare .  What a find for Julie and Pete.  If you want a beach holiday in Italy where the sea breeze gives pleasant evenings and there are no foreign tourists, let me know as this will be rented out to tourists every summer Julie and co are not using it themselves.  It was even better than I expected, with a view over the Adriatic (could see the ferries from Greece passing) from their roof and two night concerts in the piazza for which we had ringside seats, sipping our pina coladas on the balcony. After 5 nights I took the train to  urlLink Perugia  and have the most fantastic accom for E12 a night in a spacious hostel right in the heart of the city.  From both my room and the big hostel balcony are wonderful views over the city and the Umbrian landscape.  I have explored Perugia on foot (architecturally quite unlike any other city I,ve seen, with towering brick walls, often curved) and also seen  urlLink Assisi , including  urlLink St Francis,s tomb  and  urlLink Todi ,a hiitop town (as are all Roman towns it seems) with more narrow streets and winding alleys.  Tomorrow on to  urlLink Siena .
