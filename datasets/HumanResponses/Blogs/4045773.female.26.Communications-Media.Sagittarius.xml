      The six or so year old girl sitting across from me on the subway tonight had hair in neat, short cornrows and eyes so bright and wide each seemed to take in all of me.  White teeth I never saw participate in a smile, a red plaid skirt, black mary janes buckled over socks that seemed to have had a very good day running all over Manhattan.  Beside her sat her father, a burly very dark skinned man. The girl's mother sat beside me, and when a flood of night owls flooded the subway car at 42nd Street the woman scrunched over to make room for a young woman on a date with her boyfriend.  THe mother spoke to her husband in a language I didn't understand, while the girl gazed at me, unsmiling, growing more adorable by the minute.  Way past her bedtime, I thought.  Why is she up?  A thin, average-heighted white man with lanky, collarbone swaying dark hair and grimey clothes fell to his knees and began moving, very slowly, through the car.  He clutched a white coffee cup emblazoned with some non-Starbucks label (those other places still exist?) in his hands, the black ridged soles of his sneakers face up as he slid along.   He spoke loudly, but thinly, asking for help, telling riders that one day we'd need help and if we had no where to go and no one to turn to perhaps someone would reach out and help us like we ought to do to him now.  A desperate figure no one at 12:45 on a Saturday night wanted to listen to, muh less look at.  "You know what you can do, sir?" a guy in his mid-20s asked, peering down at the man.  "There's a day labor line every day at X LOCATION.  You can go there, get a job, and make some money."  The man stopped, fumbled, dropped a few cards on the floor, said he wanted the address. So the young guy borrowed a pen from a woman on his left (the couple to his right, whom he'd initially turned to for a writing implement, were fast asleep up against one another). He wrote down the address on a piece of paper that had suddenly materialized, and the man moved on. "You can bet I"ll be there tomorrow," the man said, continuing his slow forward motion through the car.  And the amazing thing happened next.  The little girl's father reached into his pocket and found a folded dollar bill, which he plopped into the man's cup.  The little girl watched this, thinking what?  Here she is, once-white socks ashy gray, leather mary janes worn and fading.  The boyfriend of the girl who the MOther had moved over for then pulled some change out of his pocket and added it to the cup.  Everyone in the car watched. Then the car stopped, arrived at the next station.  I smiled at the littel girl, then I hurried off.  Here is this father, probably not American, probably not here for a whole hell of a long time, reaching out to this pathetic man.  Most of the others on the car --perhaps even the guy with the day labor information --were jaded.  What can money do but buy you more drugs? If I had a sandwich I'd pass it on, of course, but I don't.  or, like me, wanting to pretend the begging man wasn't there, that he'd move on if we didn't pay attention, didn't say anything, didn't touch and certainly didn't make eye contact, however accidental.   There's a chance this little girl will always remember her father's action on a subway car half past midnight on the last Saturday in July.  Her father, who gave money to a man crawling on his knees on a subway.  I have not been in NYC for long, but I've been on lots of city transport in my life and have never, anywhere, seen a person crawl on their knees.  This big-eyed girl, whose field of vision is now a bit larger, may be forever changed by this moment.

       Walking through   Central Park   tonight after dinner with a friend I met fifteen years ago--I'm now 26--I felt light enough to float.&nbsp; Everything new around me, the air fresh, the sky clear, the whiz of rollerbladers creating a pleasant  zzzzzziiiiiir  as I strolled.&nbsp; Poofy dogs with red flashing lights around their necks, lest they lose their owners.&nbsp; Even the guys taking a break on the grass during a street hockey scrimmage in some zone of the park I have yet to pin down couldn't get to me.   "Hey girl, want someone to keep you&nbsp;company?" &nbsp;  "Whooheeee, gimme some of that!"   Are they kidding? I've just returned from  Turkey , where the catcalls were accompanied by far more robust lines, delivered by men in the midst of men and&nbsp;men and&nbsp;more men.   "Are you lost? I'll show you the way." "Would you like to go to an exotic island with me? We can leave tomorrow."   and   "Will you marry me?"   In Turkey, walking down the street meant having shiny imported cars slow as they approached, or stop when&nbsp;the driver caught&nbsp;a&nbsp;glimpse of the dazzling site in the rear view mirror.&nbsp; (That'd be me and&nbsp;my photojournalist friend   Mimi  ; we typically dressed in&nbsp;combat pants, loose tanks and t's and sneakers. Sex&nbsp;appeal unlike anything&nbsp;else,&nbsp;no?)&nbsp;&nbsp;As though my friend and I would simply hop in,&nbsp;blow (job) his brains out&nbsp;and bid adieu.&nbsp; And our Turkish friends told us again and again that these car-slowing, tongue-dripping men knew we weren't prostitutes.&nbsp; Heh?!&nbsp; Guess the site of two women out and about during the day was too much to handle.&nbsp; But at least these guys in Central Park weren't in cars.&nbsp; And I was too distracted by the flickering  lime flare of fireflies  to bother delivering the Spanish lines I quickly rehearsed as I walked by.&nbsp;   "Si me tocas, te kill!"   (I couldn't remember the word in Spanish.)&nbsp;   "Tu eres un gran caballo!"  &nbsp; (Likewise the word for ass; would horse suffice?).&nbsp;&nbsp;Their tiny bodies--the fireflies, not the guys, who were not small--lit sparks in a quickly fading evening.&nbsp; I walked through clouds of pale fuzzy flies--what are they, exactly?--and was amused rather than wondering how many were now&nbsp;stuck in my&nbsp;hair.&nbsp; Couples lounged in the grass at Sheep's Meadow, pushed baby carriages besides late joggers who sang along to music in their heads.&nbsp; It was a perfect night, a far cry from the hustle of  5th Avenue  a few hours earlier as I pushed past  bleach blond teens  in ragged denim teenyskirts up to *here* clutching their lanky boyfriends' hands, staring across the street at GUCCI in big letters in a goldframed window I'd never in a million years be able to keep gleaming day after day even if it were my only occupation.&nbsp; Fifth Avenune--blah.  I prefer the fireflies .

      robert04nyc writes...(his *photo* looked normal)...  "... i'm tall, have brown hair, fairly fit. i'm also very well endowed. it's not just a little bigger than average, it's much larger than average. i'm not saying it brag, but rather to get it out in open. some women like it, but most do not. i have had relationships where sex was an impossibility. i would rather get it out in the open before getting into a relationship as sex is very important.it's hard to describe exactly who i am looking for. i guess just a fun girl that lives in the city. honest, caring, hip, sexy."  And this, from a guy who wrote me an e-mail: "It would be an honor to get rejected by a girl as pretty as you." Sad!
