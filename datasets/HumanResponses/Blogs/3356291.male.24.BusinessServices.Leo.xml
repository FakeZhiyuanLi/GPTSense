       i will start to go away     i want to say i am a free man now. i don't want to hurt anyone. specially not her coz i have hurt her a million times. as it is, i don't know if i am, i guess i am. but she's getting by. her pride and probably her resolve to make things work for her is getting her by. though i know deep inside she's hurting. because of me.  i know how i can make her really happy. but i just cannot do it now. most especially now that i have to clear out certain issues about myself.  i am contented to see her happy, no matter how contrived it is. i know she's not, deep inside she's not. but something tells me she's on her way there. she can make things work for herself. so i believe i am ready to leave her now for good. maybe slowly, i will drift away. and never bother her.  we'll finally have our separate lives. maybe once in a while i will check on her. i hope i can let her be. let her find her own peace. i will leave her for good.

      august  3  my thoughts are filled with just getting out, leaving everything behind. maybe i am a walking contradiction. there is no other way for me but to lead. here i am now. leading. the pressure is getting too much. sometimes i feel like this is not me anymore. i hate some stuff i am obliged to do. smile here, smile there. give commendations. be a people person. i fucking hate all these crap.  there are times i want to be left alone. i want to have some quiet time. i want to do my thing. in spite of myself, i realized all i want to have is a low profile life. a quiet life. maybe that's why i wasn't too keen on modelling. people are so nosy. and i couldn't just smile when asked to. i just want to do my thing. i want to sleep when i want to, i want to wake up no matter how late. i want to dress up the way i want to, i hate ties, i hate looking so yuppy. i want to curse whenever i feel like it. i will be friendly when i want to, i will be nice when i feel like being nice.  show me the light please as i am about to go nuts where i am now.
