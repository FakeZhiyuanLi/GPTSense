      Will discuss Spy Fly which is being developed at University of California, Berkeley  Known affectionately as "robofly," the gadget is exactly what its name implies: a flying robot about the size of a housefly. It even looks a bit like a fly, although it will have four wings instead of two and one glassy eye instead of two beady ones. Uncle Sam, who is bankrolling the project to the tune of $2.5 million and wants to see robofly airborne by 2004   why are fly robots creating such a buzz? Flies, for all their faults, are outstanding pilots. They can take off and land in any direction, even upside down. They can change course in just 30-thousandths of a second. And they process information at speeds that make a supercomputer look like an abacus.   Specifications Robofly will weigh about 43 milligrams -- roughly the weight of a fat housefly. Its body will be made of paper-thin stainless steel and its wings of Mylar, which looks and feels a lot like Saran Wrap. Robofly will be powered by the sun, and a tiny device called a piezoelectric actuator will flap its four puny wings 180 times a second.   How does it fly?  urlLink Dickinson  discovered that insects use three different wing motions that, taken together, create backspin and air vortices that create lift. The complexity of the movement means robofly will need four wings to do what flies do with two.   Present work Controlling the robofly once its airborne.   Future California Institute of Technology in Pasadena who are developing tiny gyroscopes just one millimeter in diameter. Caltech researcher  urlLink Kris Pister  is developing for "smart dust" which will pack sensors, communicators and computing power onto tiny silicon motes   To learn more go here  urlLink http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~flymanmd/

      Recently many schemes have been proposed to organize the proxy servers into a cooperative proxy cache system.  However most of the existing proxy cache schemes require manual configuration of the cooperative proxies based on the network architecture.  Due to the size and the complexity of network structure and the nature of the existing caching protocols, complex organization and management decisions are often left to the institutions and the system administrators.  Besides manual configuration, there are other problems in existing proxy caching schemes.  These problems include complexity, load balance, hit ratio exaggeration, cooperation misuse, scalability, data replication, availability, and adaptability.  The objective of this proposed research is to reduce the complexity of managing the distributed proxies using a novel cooperative proxy caching scheme.  Each proxy in this proposed proxy cache system makes its own caching decision based on an individual-based cache model.  The Web documents are automatically replicated in the proxy cache system based on demand.  The cumulative results of the individual caching actions by all proxies automatically distribute the data closer to the clients.  These caching actions create artificial life for the cooperative proxies and hence build a self-configured, self-managed, and self-stabilized cooperative P2P proxy cache system.

      Parking in major cities is a big problem with the exponential growth of car owners and limited space availability. Finding parking space in parking lots in and around places of high activity like downtown or stadiums during games is a big problem. A lot of time and effort is wasted by drivers in actually navigating the whole parking lot looking for space. This problem can be solved by using image processing techniques.  PROPOSED ACTIVITY  We propose setting up a parking availability determination system based on image processing. The system will consist of a camera network in a parking lot which provides live image feeds to a hub. The parking lot will be mapped and the occupancy of parking spaces will be determined. The entrance of the parking lot will have a display which would show the driver a map of empty spaces. This saves the driver the trouble of actually searching for empty spaces by driving through the parking lot. The parking lot availability can also be displayed on cell phones using an application so real time occupancy can be determined. We propose parallel image processing of images of parking lots obtained by two or more cameras on a single hub thus making it cost effective.   EMPTY SPACE DETECTION  The whole parking lot is mapped with specific block of pixels in the input image assigned a parking spot. When a parking spot is occupied by a car its presence can be detected by applying image segmentation algorithm and it can be further verified by taking the color and intensity differential for edge extraction and recognition of vehicle occupancy. Now cars being driven on the aisle could be either be one needing a parking spot or one on its way out. The obvious problem in such a system would be reserving spots for vehicles being driven on the aisle so that the correct availability is determined. This problem can be solved by tracking the cars entering the parking lot and tagging them. Tracking these cars would be a trivial problem since these cars move linearly and with a slow constant velocity. For the cars that have been tagged the nearest parking spot in its path will be reserved.

      Put simply, Voice over wireless networks is about sending voice packets over wireless LANs and MANETs(Mobile Adhoc NETworks). So, we have been sending data packes over WLANs. What's the problem with sending voice packets? This is easier said than done. Lets explore some of the problems with communicating voice packets over wireless data networks.  Data transmission relies heavily on error free reception.The exising wireless standards such as the 802.11 series are optimized for sending data. Thus if packets are lost over the wireless link, they will be repeatedly retransmitted by the sender, till they are successfully sent, or the retransmission limit is received. The delay caused due to these retransmissions is hardly of concern for data transmissions. On the contrary, voice communication emphasizes more on being delay free than error-free. Speech codecs do have some level of proprietary error concealment, which can make up for packet losses. However, delays in receiving packets are undesirable, as those who've been subject to such delays in long distance phone conversations would agree. The ITU specifies a limit of 150ms for end-to-end delay for voice communications. However, equipment manufacturers often stretch the limit to 200-250ms.  The delay in the wireless link is just a part of the problem. If we have a phone which sends voice packets through the access point, and thereafter through the internet back-bone to another phone, the delay and jitter issues associated with VoIP systems are added on. The good news?. For one, the IEEE recently ratified a new MAC standard named the 802.11e. One of the significant features of this standard, is that it prioritizes packets. Thus voice packets have a higher priority, as compared to data packets. This is just a part solution, since more needs to be done to limit the large number of retransmissions due to packet losses in the channel. certain companies such as Spectralink and Cisco have already come out with Wireless VoIP phones. The Spectralink phones have been charged with tweaking the 802.11 MAC by reducing the contention time (which is the time each wifi user waits before he can transmit). And while equipment makers and standards bodies keep arguing about the nature of such a thing, the phones seem to serve the purpose.  Some of the proposed methods focus on adapting voice over wlan focus on avoiding packet losses due to bit errors in the channel and collisions. These include 1) Using link adaptation (i.e feedback from the receiver to determine the quality of the wireless channel and adapt transmission accordingly) 2) Transmitting multiple copies of the same packet so that even if one copy is lost, it doesnt have to be retransmitted. This introduces additional overheads but reduces delay due to retransmissions.  There are a whole lot of issues associated with different aspects of voice over wireless LANs. Skeptics may wonder about the long term prospects of VowLAN, given that VoIP systems are being deployed only now. Voice over wireless networks still holds a lot of promise as a cheaper alternative to cellular communications in the long run.

                      Humans have always wanted to interact with their environment. Humans communicate with other people as well as objects daily to get work done. Computers and machines have become important elements in our society. We use them to perform various tasks. Humans still rely on keyboards, mouse or buttons to interact with machines. This has tremendously affected the naturalness of interaction. Humans interact with each other using speech and gestures and it would be great if we can do the same with machines. Recently a lot of research has been done for using speech as input for systems. Interaction using only speech has some drawbacks. The speech recognition system has to be trained by the user and even then they are not accurate enough. Also designing speech input based systems that can be operated by just one user donâ€™t make sense.  Gesture recognition has been used to complement speech recognition. Gesture recognition can be done by interpreting the motion of a human arm. E.g. a hello wave. Gesture recognition was initially done using glove based techniques. These gloves had mechanical sensors to measure the arm and finger joint angles.  The user has to wear a mechanical glove and carry the load of wires attached to it. This method of gesture recognition defeats the purpose (naturalness of interaction) itself.  Researchers have now tried gesture recognition using visual sensors. Presently common human hand gestures like pointing, wave, and stop as well as American Sign Language gestures can be recognized using vision. Further research is needed to understand more complex human gestures and use both hand tracking for gesture recognition. I am presently working on a gesture recognition system.  PROPOSAL:  We plan to develop a gesture recognition system which permits a human user wearing a specially marked glove to command a computer system to carry out predefined gesture action commands. Here they basically get the initial and the final position of the points of interest (markers) on the glove and extract their motion vector, since different gestures have different sets of motion vectors for the markers they can be discriminated.  After solving the static gesture recognition problem we plan to form a library of simple dynamic human gestures which can be recognized and be used for intelligent control of machines. This would require tracking the human hand. Such gestures would consist of discrete abrupt motions and a multi modal particle filter would be needed to track it using a library of motion models.  Bandwidth limitation is a major concern in video tele-conferencing. Our system can be used to for video coding: image sequence are described by states (position, scale and orientation) of all objects in the scene and only change in model parameters are sent instead of the whole sequence of images.

       At 100Mbps of effective throughput, the 802.11n is a quantum leap over the existing 802.11 a/b/g standards which allow for a maximum throughput of 54Mbps. And this 54Mbps is just the total throughput. The effetive throughput of the existing standards is further reduced (about 18 - 22Mbps), due to the various overheads in the 802.11 standards.   This high data rate may finally open the doors for real-time multimedia communication such as voice and video over the wireless link which would share the bandwidth with existing data transmissions.      Some of the proposed techniqies for increasing the data rates include using MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) antennas with a 2x2 MIMO antenna, (2 transmitters and 2 receivers) allowing a sata rate of 250 Mbps, and a 4x4 MIMO allowing a data rate of 500 Mbps. It would also employ OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) which exploits multipath (i.e multiple versions of the transmitted signal which arrives along multiple paths at the receiver), to increase the effective throughput.      The 802.11n will operate in the frequency spectrum of 5Ghz as 802.11a, which has suddenly brought this hitherto unpopular standard back into the limelight. It would also be made backward compatible with the existing b and g standards.       802.11n will be ratified as a standard by 2006. But products based on the same will be out by 2005. This is one important development to look forward to in the future.        urlLink  http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3379371     urlLink  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/08/12/802-11n_proposal/
