       Well flight two went much better than flight one.  I actually kept a controlled hover for about 10 seconds a few times.  I reached an altitude of about 4 feet and didn't turn it over one time....almost lost it a few times, but no crash.  If I can keep that up it should last for a while without repair parts.  I'll have to get some pictures of it airborne tomorrow.  I have a long way to go but I definately see the potential.  I hope in the future to do sling loads and landing to small points and even dust landings.  When Bill's copter arrives, then things will get real interesting with competitions and other ideas.

       I recieved my RC Helicopter today and it isn't broken yet.  It is pretty durable though.  The controls are not set up the way I would like them and I might change them in the future but I don't want to mess with it just yet.  I will give this setup a try.  I learned one hard lesson though so far  Turn off the radio controller before picking up the helicopter.  OUCH!  I accidently bumped the controls with the copter in my hand and it started up.  I will fly once more tonight and hopefully I can make it through another battery charge without breaking it.  I am definately getting braver which is more dangerous.  There are several looky lous that show up....probably hoping I will crash.

       This site   urlLink Rogue River Mail Boat Trips   Looks like a great place to stop. We will have to go there someday, but unfortunately our trip will be taking place around March and it won't be open for business.

       Because of my job position I have to correct people everyday and because of it, they like to find reasons to correct me.&nbsp; Most of the time&nbsp;people get very defensive when you point out&nbsp;what they are doing wrong and what they need to do to fix it.&nbsp; I try to control my defensiveness now because of one of my favorite scriptures.&nbsp; "And ye have murmured because&nbsp;he hath been plain unto you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities." (2 Nephi 1:26)&nbsp; I try to think about this scripture anytime I receive criticism, constructive or not.

        urlLink Mini Dragonfly Electric Powered RC Helicopter.     Sitting around bored out of my mind, Bill, my tentmate, states "Lets get remote control helicopters!" So now one is on the way and should be here within the week. I expect it will be broken in less than five minutes and repair parts will be on order.

       Well I got myself a RC car.  This will give me something to do while I am charging batteries or waiting for parts on my helicopter.  I don't know for sure the condition, but it was less than half the price for a new one with battery and charger, plus a new motor is only about 17 bucks.  Should be enough to keep me entertained.

       My tail motor seized up while flying today and now I am stuck waiting on parts plus I ordered a few upgrades that will either eliminate my need for the damper system I made out of paperclips or make it much better.  I flew great last night and today.  I am starting to work on 3D hovering (more difficult).  Bill also helped me fix one of the broken tailrotor blades and it was working today before my motor seized.  It's pretty stressful trying not to crash this thing and it can quickly grow into an expensive hobby.  I found that it is common to burn up motors every so many flights and they aren't that expensive.  You can spend a little more money and get better, more powerful motors.  I might do that when I lose my main motor.  I took my training gear off last night to and the helicopter looks so much smaller and I ended up trying to be a lot more careful so I put it back on for a little while longer.

       Wow!  Tonight was fun.  I flew two batteries worth of flight and only landing a few times.  I was hovering within a couple of feet of the intended point at head height.  I even made some landings on top of boxes and tables.  One box was only twice the length of the helicopter in size and had obstacles right in front of it so there was little room for error.  It was a rush to be doing so well and I feel bad for Bill because I know he really wants to fly his but he is waiting on parts.  I'm ready to set up simple skill challenges, but I have no one to challenge right now.  I have heard at least one more person say they are going to buy one.  It is going to be funny to see them popping up all around the camp.

       I don't really know about bankrupcy but this article  urlLink Trump casinos on the rocks  raises a few questions for me.  Trump claims that the casinos were only 2% of his net worth.  That would mean that he should have enough to cover the expenses of the casinos.  How can you say "I can't pay this debt" and wash your hands of the problem when you still have all this other money.  I know if I had a debt on my credit card and I had the money, I would still be responsible for that debt.  I wonder how many people are effected by this bankrupcy and just so Mr. Trump can doesn't have to settle the debt and stay rich.  Like I said I don't understand the process.

       This site  urlLink RC Groups Discussion  showed me an idea that I was able to modify on my helicopter to make the vibration/wobble problem go away.  Now I am hovering great and I can keep it in the air several minutes at a time and move the helicopter where I want it to go.  I even landed to a specific point on top of a pile of wood.  I broke my tail rotor now though and have to keep superglueing it back together until the repair parts get here.  I used paperclips for my modification and they work great so far.  I was getting so frustrated with the wobble so I am extremely glad I found a fix.

       I can't get the vibrations to go away, but I am getting better at dampening them.  I was hoveing well yesterday.  I tried using peanut butter on the control links on the rotor head because I thought it was to loose and that is why it was vibrating, but it didn't seem to help that much.  Bill's helicopter is not flying anymore until he gets some new parts, which are already in the mail.  His tailrotor motor is completely broke (he got superglue on it).  I'm thinking of buying a little RC car too.  There is less that can go wrong so I think that would be fun.

       Bill got his helicopter in the mail today and we flew three separate times. He crashed his a lot and broke his tailrotor. He also got superglue all over his tailrotor motor and it is making it not work well so he ordered some replacement parts. Good thing is that it is still flyable. My helicopter has a strange vibration which I have almost no clue where it is coming from or what to do about it. I have something I will try tomorrow, but the few times I was able to take off without the vibrations effecting the copter, I was hovering great! I think if I could just get my vibration to go away, that I could hover for a whole battery charge (about 7 minutes). I can't wait for tomorrow to fly some more, I just hope my next idea for things to try to fix it will work.

       The servo I was concerned about went haywire the other night and I had to do a complete overhaul on the servo.  It appears to be working right now, but last nights flight was cut short too because my swashplate kept coming apart in flight and when that happened, the helicopter would lose all control.  I ended up superglueing the swashplate together last night and now I am waiting for the wind to die down to see if I can have a successful flight finally.  I have taken just about every piece of the helicopter apart now so I have a pretty good idea the way it works.  I hope I can get a few problem free flights so I can get some good practice in.

       I know I was planning to work on landing accuracy today, but I succumbed to peer pressure from Bill and changed the controls on my radio to make more sense so in reality I had to learn it all over again.  I had my radio all torn apart and all the wires disconnected.  I was kind of worried I wouldn't get it put back together right or break something.  I picked up the new controls a lot quicker though and I was really rough on the copter.  I'm still not as good as I was with the old controls, but I am close.  A couple of more flights and I think I will be ready to start landing accuracy training again.  I might be running into some problems with one of my servos though so I will have to keep my eye on that.

       I got a haircut today and because of the bus ride, it took almost 4 hours to eat lunch and get my haircut.  I flew my copter tonight even though the wind was a little on the strong side.  I was hovering at head height and only crashed a couple of times (which I will blame on the wind).  I found a board and tomorrow I will work on my accuracy by trying to land on it.  After I get good at that, I will elevate the board to make things more interesting.

       Today's flight was great.  Last night I went out with a flashlight to find the piece I lost.  It was a bearing the size of a pea and the whole area is scattered with rocks about the size of a pea.  After saying a prayer and diligently looking I found it about 40 feet from the crash site.  I went out with a full charge and hovered for over a minute at a time and didn't crash once.  I was able to run out the whole battery without a significant negative event.  Just as I was getting brave and was ready to hover a little higher, the battery power was getting low and I didn't have the power left to get any significant altitude.  I'm able to keep it consistantly in a 10 ft square now and will start working on accurate landings soon.

        by Jonathan Vance When I peeled away the plastic, The cover was smooth and clean. The pages were crisp, like an apple, And the gilded edges gleamed. The binding crackled as I opened the pages; The first breath of a babe, Waking up from the ages. The magnificent tome was unblemished. And wouldn’t be useful till tarnished. Years later, The cover was battered, And within it, The pages were tattered. Any one leaf Would meet your gaze With a flood of colors Like the map to a maze. Each little nugget I’d found in my quest, Had been marked and noted, Then put to the test. This book had a price, years ago. Its value now? You cannot know.    urlLink A.

       The helicopter is still in one piece but it went out of control today.  I was doing great and all of a sudden the little guy went down hard.  The tail rotor came flying off and I lost a little bearing that is required to stabilize the shaft that the tailrotor spins on.  I couldn't find it anywhere, but I will look again tomorrow and then will try to fabricate something if I can't find it.  I will probably order some spares.  Hopefully I'll get it flying again soon.

       I found this article and entire site pretty interesting.  I'm not really for or against the guy at this point.  I am trying to keep an open mind and wait to see the debates before I make any final decision.  The site has to do with the Officer's that served with him in Vietnam and for the most part, they just don't like him because of the things he said about the war and the activities of the unit (which they claim are not true and the  urlLink picture  here shows attitudes contrary to the pictures Kerry described.) and they also claim that he didn't follow orders very well.  I am trying not to fault the guy for leaving Vietnam the way he did because if I had a chance to come home to my family (especially a chance given because I was wounded 3 times already) I would probably take it, but I am not planning on getting into politics either.  I don't know that I would want a Commander in Chief that gets out when the going gets tough and not see a job through.

       Flight five didn't go well.  I learned another lesson today.  The helicopter is very sensitive to wind I was doing great for about 3 minutes and had the helicopter up to 10 feet on accident.  Then I had a big crash, caused by the wind, and the tailrotor came flying off and I had to find several very small pieces.  I was able to find them all with Bill's help and fixed it on the spot.  I actually tried once more before finally deciding it was to windy and would have to wait on account of weather.

         Flight number three almost ended in disaster.  Halfway through the battery life, one of the major input control pieces came loose which caused the helicopter to do its own thing.  I didn't realize it happened though and I kept trying anyways.  Finally after several rough landings I looked a little closer and noticed the loose piece.  After a repair involving a small ziptie and having to adjust control rods to level out the rotor head, the problem was solved and flight four started.  Flight four went great, but was ended early because of lack of light.  I was hovering for over 30 seconds at a time and had the helicopter as high as my head a few times.  I am somewhat concerned that the piece that came loose today was slightly damaged or at least made weak.  I hope I can keep it flying quite a bit longer before needing major repairs.
