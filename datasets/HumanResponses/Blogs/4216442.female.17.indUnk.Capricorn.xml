         so bored.. so so bored.   well, alots been going on. everytime i try to update i get distracted. which is nothing surprising. lol. but anyway...  i went camping with lee last weekend i think. it was fun, i met justin and stephon, hung out with pat, lee, duane and butch.. got drunk off my ass. got melasted, got shot, and so on so forth. it was  fun .  then basically this whole week i hung out with G. we brought crys to planned parenthood thursday. then we brought her home. G came back over for the night, and we got bored and felt stalkerish so we walked  all  around amsterdam looking for  someone . hehe. we didnt find him though, but we did accomplish alot.  we talked to a stranger petted a strange dog used a public bathroom played on playgrounds  swings!  thats all i have to say lmao got attacked by spiders got waved at and the best thing..  stole big orange cones!  lmao.  hes awesome deals. by the time we got home i was hella tired and passed right out. the next morning we was all ready to go somewhere again, but couldnt find anything to do. so when my mommie went to work we went to visit her, she gave us money go to for a ride around the lake..  instead we ended up in northville... we got all distracted by the boys on the other side of the road that we didnt realize we were going over the speed limit and guess what!  we had an encounter wif a cop . lmao, yup. he pulled us over. asked us if we have been doing drugs or drinking, visiting their local crack houses, if there was drugs in the car. yadda yadda. but we got outta that ticket cuz he knew G's brother. thank gosh for that..   after that lil incident we bolted outta there and took a wrong road, we ended up in speculator..  village of the big trees  lmao. and we played on their swings! then we left..  see, i love my swings...   around 8ish we finally made it home, lmao. only three hours after we left. and we watched a movie wif mom. got bored, told monz to come over.. and around 11 we were gone  again . we had this urge to go to Albany. and since im  excellent  wif directions we got there.. traveled around.. and around 1ish we decided to leave...  well, it was easier getting there then leaving! lemme tell you that. cuz we kept gettin lost, went to every damn place known to man, and around 3;30 we got home. lmfao. my ass was too tired, crawled up next to monz and fell asleep.  G woke me up this afternoon by  humping my ass  with my rabbit. it was kinkie. and then he left to go home. now im hella tired, but i cant sleep.   boy, its been fun.   i think im gonna attempt a nap again. theres nada to do. and talking isnt stimulating me this afternoon.   listening to:  goodies - ciara  feeling:  overly tired.    I'm not bein too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it  You think you're slick  Tryna hit  But I'm not dumb  I'm not bein too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it

        yesh, its true.  people do change. and usually for the better. which if that was the case, this would be a happi ending to my situation. but its not.. so i guess i should explain, everything.  the other day i got the computer back, since i havent spoke to crys or matt in a while, since she moved i figured i would check their blog to see what was goin on up there.  after readin a few entries into hers, it just pissed me off. she kept saying how  i  was the one pushing  her  away, and ruining our friendship. and making me out to be the bad girl. when in reality it was both of us doing it, or no one at all making an effort, because how the hell am i supposed to call her when its long distance, i had no computer, and i have no car? vice versa i guess... i dont know what fucking miracle she expected me to pull outta my ass. and when G comes down, i cant beg him to bring her and matt along if he doesnt want to.  its his car . but she made it all out to sound like i am the bad one. and like she didnt do anything, that is were my victim speech came in.   anyways i decided i would call her and try and have her explain it to me. since it was urking me pretty bad, but she wasnt there, so i asked to see if G was there.. but he was on his way down. so i emailed her... which i admit was  harsh  here and there, but it was how i was feeling at the moment, and if she can state her opinions and how she feels and  know  im going to see it. why cant i do the same?  well, she read it. got all pissed off. and now we are fighting. shes taking it out on monz too, and i dont even see what he has to do with it. she hates him, he dislikes her. she treats him like shit, so why cant he do the same back to her? hm. i just dont like the fact that she has  always  treated him like shit in front of me, knowing i cant stand it. and he doesnt do it back, because he knows. he knows that it bugs me when my friends treat eachother like that. and hes respectful enough not to let it get to him. if he does it to her when im not around, i  cant  control that.   but she picked apart his spelling errors (which is something he cant help) and called me a  whore  and a few other things, told me i was less mature than her. *i dont know in who's eyes because we both have our moments of immaturity, same as any other normal teen*, and she just hurt my feelings. which obviously didnt bother her at all, monz was sittin right next to me and i almost started crying. so im kinda happi he was here, juss to give me that hug.   i can understand why she wouldnt wanna be my friend anymore, and i should say the same thing. i cant though.. no matter what happens crys will  always  be considered/remembered as my best bud. we had more good times than bad, and the one time i stand up and tell her how i feel it blows up major. but i am more than willing to just talk to her about everything and try and be like we were before, which i know will never happen. i said things outta anger and spite. and kinda regret it... and i never met to come off as a bitch, but how can you not help it when your being called a whore, and everything else?   at this point i give up, i dont know what we are fighting about exactly. maybe its cuz what i said.. or the fact that im the "bad" friend out of us two. maybe its because of the boys. or we're just all growing up and drifting apart. either way it  hurts , and im not gonna sit here and pretend im not hurting. cuz i am.. ill be the first to admit that. but i dont want to pin this all on her (like she might be doing to me) and make her seem like the awful one, because we both did it to ourselves.  anyway, enough of this. ill talk more about it later on tonight, adios.    listening to:  breaking the habit - linkin park  feeling:  ultra confused.    I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit tonight
