       Hello. I've been really really&nbsp;busy lately. My Statistics Quiz is tomorrow, have to hand in my research paper by Friday. Doing my reference list now. Thank God I'm almost done although I did it last minute. Hehe! My Econs Quiz, which&nbsp;I'm not really&nbsp;prepared for,&nbsp;is on next Tuesday. Furthermore, I have an Assignment for Malaysian Studies which I'm supposed to hand in by 2nd August. My  Finals  coming up too. In 3 weeks time. Aahh! Wish me luck ya?    Hmm, this weekend, my aunt and her family from England&nbsp;are coming back for the summer holiday. They'll be here for 2 weeks and will be going back to England the day I finish my exam. Wont be able to spend quality time with them. Tragic isn't it?   Oh well, I guess I'd better get going. Got to catch up on my studies and make sure I score well for my Finals.   By the way, the picture below&nbsp;was taken&nbsp;at my class this afternoon. :) Ok then, take care! Buhbye....
