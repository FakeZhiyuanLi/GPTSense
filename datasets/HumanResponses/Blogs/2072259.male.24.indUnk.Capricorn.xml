       My short story  urlLink "Beggar's Banquet"  is over at Dmitry's  urlLink XPEHb  journal.  The story is one of my lit-fic in sci-fi pieces but is more of an experiment in broken imagery than anything plot-wise.  During my junior and senior years of college, I was playing a lot with poetic flow in long prose settings.  Ultimately, the stories became  too  removed from setting and structure to work well ("Journey to the Heavens", a meditation on Eastern philosophy through the American "space monkey" launch is probably a good example of its failure), but the gradual collapse of stream in "Beggar's Banquet" probably helps pull a reader along instead of throwing him/her into a spastic firing of meta-electrons.  Anyway, check it out.  Dmitry is running a nice show over there, and there's plenty of substance if you get fed up with me.  I mean in no way to demean my fellow XPEHb contributors, but Dmitry's photos make any pain you might experience from our rhetoric worthwhile.

       Less volatile indeed!  One has to wonder whether Sunday's Bears win could have been achieved with Kordell Stewart, but one needn't mill over it, because a win is a win is a win.  The new Shins CD,  Chutes Too Narrow , is excellent by the way.  Critics are claiming  O Inverted World  marked the beginning of concious thought for humanity, though, and that this is just a nice follow-up.  I don't remember the universe getting knocked to the floor by the last album, but the "sophomore slump" is like juicy red meat in criticism.  I don't think there's any REAL "sophomore slump", the same kind of approaches used following a successful first are the same as those used following a second, third, fourth, etc...  One magazine I read said, essentially, "some bands clone their original sound, some bands rebel against their original sound, and others mature/evolve".  Who are we trying to kid here?    It is no great feat nor surprise that bands must have their second record sound like  something .  There is no mysterious trend in how bands make their decision, they just do it and the results are as numerous as second albums themselves.  The whole idea of the slump needs to be abandoned as a viable introduction/structure for a piece of criticism.  It's an introduction much too steeped in the business of music.  Though we've been trained to care about the marketability of music, I don't think the album itself cares too much.

        urlLink Networks have noticed a mysterious disappearance of 18-34 year old males watching television this season .  Maybe because we are downloading all their shows off the internet.

       The question for the day is:   Is a mall a good place to hole up in case of a zombie outbreak?  George Romero's  Dawn of the Dead  and Max Brooks' seminal  The Zombie Survival Guide  seem to give us contradictory answers.  In Romero's film, a group of four survivors find great safety in a shopping mall after securing the structure.  All of their needs (aside from social relations) are accounted for and the mall is a large, relatively controllable environment...  once it is secure.  That is the important thing to emphasize.  In  Dawn of the Dead  only two mall residents survive the process of shutting down outsider access, a sign that the task is extremely dangerous.  Of course, one can argue that if early situations had been handled more wisely, the deaths could have been avoided.  Romero's mall is strangely vacant aside from a spattering of zombies.  Brooks' however sets a more realistic stage of the possible overcrowding of a mall.  In the early stages of an outbreak (and continuing indefinitely), malls will be points of attraction for both zombies and people.  THIS MEANS DANGER!  Even if you can arrange the initial arrivals into an efficient military, constant influx of outsiders and zombies would present continual problems.  In order for Romero's mall to be as vacant as it was when the heroes arrived, how many regular people would have already died at the location?  This certainly doesn't say much for your odds of survival.  Still...  Are the potential benefits greater than the dangers?  Large parking lots give you a good scope of approaching undead, there is a large quantity variety of inherent supplies and the attraction of people means an ability to establish new trade, society and culture.  If you've got the answer, weigh in at the  urlLink forums .

        No more Tuesday Morning Quarterback for awhile     beeFymojo:   espn.com just ousted Gregg Easterbrook (one of their best non-sports-people-but-still-serious-about-sports columnists) presumably because of something he miswrote about Jews off-site  Moogle:  Something he mis-wrote?   beeFymojo:   [Edited for length: text is here in the  urlLink   10.16.2003 entry .   beeFymojo:   as he explains it, he didn't mean to bring in the jews-love-the-money stereotype   beeFymojo:   meant more to go for, how can the victims of horrible violence also market it  Moogle:  I got more of a "Jews are corrupting us" sort of thing.  Moogle:  Yeah, I can see the glimmer of that argument lying in there.   beeFymojo:  obviously, what he wrote was bad  Moogle:  But, yeah, this is why you have people look over your work.   beeFymojo:   but that is part of the problem with the quick-update philosophy of the web right now   beeFymojo:   the blog mentality, so to speak  Moogle:  Oh well, he'll get his foot surgically removed from his mouth, and get a job somewhere else.   beeFymojo:   yeh   beeFymojo:   i just hope the football column gets picked up quickly  Moogle: Uh huh   beeFymojo:   i'd paste some quotes in here, but espn eradicated the whole archive   beeFymojo:   it is a good thing that RF has taken a year to get its first issue out  Moogle:  Yeah, otherwise you guys would totally have come across as the New Hitler Youth of the critical world, or something.   beeFymojo:   and our publisher would fire us all  Moogle:  Hey, speaking of insta-update and blog mentality, I've been reading Transmetropolitan...   beeFymojo:   o?   beeFymojo:   how is that?  Moogle:  Oh, it's good.  Moogle:  Especially if you have delusions of being a writer or journalist.  Moogle:  But the "Feedsite" thing Ellis put in there is remarkably similar to blog-news  Moogle:  Basically, people sign up to be "listeners," and run around equipped with backpacks that feed everything they see and hear into these massive website/tv station things.  Moogle:  These are then filtered and turned into television.   beeFymojo:   that is interesting  Moogle:  A bit more centralized than modern blogs, but I could see centralized "Plastic" style hubs of "professional bloggers" who actually get good at writing or investigative journalism, or editorials, for that matter.   beeFymojo:   that may be where things ultimately go   beeFymojo:   it is kind of moving that way  Moogle:  Especially as professional writers are starting to keep blogs of a sort...   beeFymojo:   Gregg Easterbrook, incidently has one   beeFymojo:   which brings us full circle to the problem of that kind of system   beeFymojo:   pretty soon, we will just have rediscovered the old media publication environment   beeFymojo:   i mean, if you think about it as a frontier  Moogle:  Yeah, but for a few moments, right now, it can be remarkably simple to thrust yourself into literati.   beeFymojo:   in the literal frontier you had people just going and living independently off the land...   beeFymojo:   and here we are   beeFymojo:   yeah.  it's nice to have a moment  Moogle:  Yup. Pay attention. This is history.

       Well, the Bears with Chris Chandler look a lot less volatile than with Kordell Stewart.  I've been trying to figure this Kordell guy out and my basic assumption is that he's essentially a rookie who has been in the league a long time.  With some good and possibly difficult coaching, he could turn his career back around and at least be considered a decent quarterback.  He just makes too many rookie mistakes on a Bears team whose veterans have the injury bug.  Chandler has plenty of experience and can use his limited abilities more effectively than Stewart can use his versatility.  I don't like to see Chandler start, but I feel fairly calm when he does.  Maybe Kordell Stewart needs to stop trying to prove he is capable of getting out of his slump and just focus on the situation at hand.  He's given the opponent the ball at the end of each first half this year, all in situations where the game was close and we could have made it, at least, closer.  These aren't life-or-death moments, so don't treat them that way.  Honestly, I have no ideal.  But my initial statement is probably the most true thing...  The Bears with Kordell, for some reason -- whatever reason you decide, are an unstable concoction.  Super Bowl!

       Kill Bill was tonight's attraction...  Bought some comp tickets off a guy for $5 a pop for a sold out show.  The story is funny considering a dream I had about a week ago...  My old friend Chris and I decided to go to the big Chicago premiere of Kill Bill, only we didn't have tickets.  Somehow we ran into a guy from my high school who had stacks of comp tickets he was giving away.  Chris, being the astute kinda guy he is, figured out the tickets were counterfit though.  My response, "If they find out, the find out... but it's worth taking our chances."  Soon after, I learned ticket holders would get to meet Quentin Tarantino before the film.  Now, I don't know any HUGE Tarantino fans, but my imagination created every type from handwritten t-shirt-clad teeny-boppers to film geeks with scraggly hair and tiny specs.  And not only was Quentin meeting his fans, but he was staging a seance' gone awry for groups of a dozen or so.  I finally got into the room where the seances were being staged and while waiting for the scene to reset itself, Quentin looks at my jacket and says, "That's a good coat.  It's got that classic, vintage look... That's a great coat."  I humbly say thank you and in the process notice he is wearing a pair of sneakers like the ones I own.  I point and say, "Same shoes too."  He laughs and points out we're like evil twins and all of a sudden he's schocked.  "Your shirt," he says and goes to his bag and pulls out a book and holds it up to my chest to confirm this strange occurence.  I am wearing a Forlorn Funnies t-shirt, he has an issue of Forlorn Funnies.  "WHOA!" is what we both say, and I am about to suggest he make a movie of Forlorn Funnies when I realize I can use such a point to get a creative "in" with Mr. Tarantino once we get a chance to talk more.  Well, in the back of the room is a fanboy type guy I went to college with, who is upset by the parrallels between me and the director.  He starts teasing me about how I'm taking the attention away from everyone else for no reason; he steps back and begins falling.  Quentin Tarantino, invoking Gene Wilders when a child falls into his river of chocolate, says matter-of-factly, "Watch out.  This may be a fake seance, but that's a real bottomless pit with acid at the bottom."  I wake up before flesh begins to be eaten away.  By the way, Kill Bill is loads of fun.  I'll keep anymore comments about it for the review and move on here in the blog.

       Went to go see  urlLink Neal Pollack  read at  urlLink Quimby's  last night.  We were a dumb-founded (maybe just dumb) crowd who couldn't think up any questions in the question and answer part.  We tried.  Oh yes, we tried.  But trying to think equals silence, and silence is not conductive in a question-answer session.    In a public venue, I find it difficult to ask questions of a underground/alternative artist.  For this reason:  No one knows much of the background details of the artist.  When you're in these book reading crowds, you have the tendency, though, to assume everyone else knows many more details than you do.  You don't want to ask a question that will get you old women staring at you over the tops of their glasses while shaking their heads at your baffling ignorance; this makes you feel like the illiterate scum of the known universe; this is bad.  At  urlLink Quimby's  last night, the only information the group universally knew was that Pollack is from Chicago, is now living somewhere else, and writes as/about hilariously ultra-important alter-ego characters.  We got through the first two facts with a certain amount of cautious prodding...  "How is your return to Chicago?"  "So, are you living in Philly or Austin right now?"  "Do/did you like it?"...   Neal spared us the grief of stumbling around the third and read an Anthology piece on Columbia.  If you haven't read/heard Neal Pollack yet, you should write it down in your planner for next Tuesday at 10am.  Stop into a Borders or your local underground zine shop, and find the  urlLink Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature  and read the introduction.  That's all you'll need to understand how important a piece of work it is.  Look for an interview with Mr. Pollack in the second full RF issue.

        Football is a game of gods.  Baseball is a game of curses   For the 7 out of 8 American households not tuned into the Cubs ill-fortuned drops of games 5, 6 and 7 of the National League Championship Series...  Shame on you.  Most people don't believe in magic anymore because they don't bother looking.  A good portion of the world, though, got to witness some lingering force from a more mystical time incinerate the bolstering hope (and egos) of Wrigley parishoners.  Sure, you can look at each moment in the Cubs' demise and explain it all logically, but when you take the tragedy in whole...  There is something far more powerful than you, I, Alex Gonzalez or Steve Bartman at work here.  And all of baseball are its puppets.  Red Sox lost as well, by the way.  It is very satisfying for all whose allegiances lie in the south side of Chicago, that Cubs fans were partly responsible for game 6.  They, moreso than the Cubs, are the bane of our baseball existence.  But, more on this in an upcoming RF essay.  Time to work.

       The  urlLink Kill Bill  soundtrack has a 10 minute Latin-ish cover of the Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" by Santa Esmerelda.  It's my feeling that covers should never be recorded straight (concerts are a different beast altogether).  It's disrespectful and shameless to peddle another musician's wares as one's own - even if you claim it's in "tribute".  Can you imagine if Picasso had painted a copy of Van Gogh's Starry Night?  Well, the inbred patrons of art would probably have clapped very loudly and pulled some bars of gold out of their cavernous belly buttons to pay Picasso with.  But Picasso... Picasso would have laughed all day in  urlLink those shorts  he wore in some of the David Douglas Duncan photos.  On the other hand, if Picasso had fractured Starry Night, we'd have an actually interesting piece of work.  It's how Dada and Pop Art fed their extended families.  So, my advice to all the ambitious bands out there that would like to do a cover or two...  Listen to the original and add something to it.  Change its focus, change its flavor, find something inside of the song that the current emphases hide.  People will love you more for it.  So, remember.  Faithful covers are for chumps and concerts.  Required listening: Cat Power  The Covers Record , Red House Painters "Silly Love Songs", Yo La Tengo "Little Honda", the "Roxanne" song in  Moulin Rouge , and the above-mentioned track from Kill Bill.

       As you might have already noticed, RF proper is functional.  The last touch I'd really like to get working before we start pulling people in is to get The Coco Cabana Club's beautiful eulogy of Captain Ahab "Moby Dick".  The band is struggling to give me the track without giving me a new incarnation of the blaster worm, but hopefully we can get things figured out in a short amount of time.  Regardless, we'll probably start publicizing the magazine and hope word-of-mouth extends our coverage.  And I'll be writing about a bunch of different pieces here so keep coming back.

        Missing Links   There are some updates to the "Stuff to Read" section of the blog.  Tuesday Morning Quarterback has found a new home at NFL.com (ye gods!), so the TMQ link now takes you to TMQ.  There is no archive yet, so I will be linking directly to the articles.  I've also added  urlLink Spinsanity , which is a very nice site that cuts down rhetoric and tries to give its readers a clear idea of what's  actually  going on in America's political system.  They criticize the truth-twisting of Ann Coulter and Michael Moore with equal disdain...  Now, that's refreshing.

        Skinned   On Friday, I happened to flip-and-stick (a term I made up and hope to use on a regular basis) on HBO's  Naked in America  documentary on a global tour of the artist  urlLink Spencer Tunick , who has made a name for himself by orchestrating seas of naked individuals across natural landscapes.  When Kristi and I saw the original ad promoting the program, we both kind-of winced at Spencer's... exploitation in the name of art, i guess.  That is...  here was another artist peddling mediocre nude compositions for their cliched shock appeal and 'taking the art world by storm.'  Bleh.  It's not that I won't eat it, it's that I really have no taste for it.  But what engrossed my attention were the motivations behind the exploitation; the documentary could assess these things where Tunick's photographs could not.     Before getting too far into this point, though, I'd like to say that the director/editors did an excellent job of presenting the finished photographs of Spencer Tunick; detail crops were handled with a good understanding of composition and  the  composition itself, and I got an excellent idea of the presence of Tunick's work through it.  I've seen this botched plenty of times, so it was nice to see it done correctly.    Anyway, back to more pressing matters...  In documenting Spencer's struggles and triumphs at convincing random individuals to pose for him and in interviewing those who did agree,  Naked in America  explores the national relation of global citizens to their bodies.  Probably the prime example is the director of the Russian Museum's argument with Spenser over the implied erotocism of his work.  Tunick's goal is to create very stoic nude photographs, and from an American perspective this is a success.  But to a Russian, coming from a recent cultural heritage of communism, the simple presence of a naked body has an erotic value to it because of how new such an individual act is.  As one of the models (the director was the centerpiece of a photo, incidentally) states in explaining his drive for posing, under the former cultural/political system one's body did belong to oneself but to the greater society.  It is these relations that the documentary explores so splendidly.  Japan's corporate mentality, France's openness to nude on a wall but prudent opposition to naked on the street. the world-travelling youth of Ireland stepping away from the reserved ideals of the church...  There is also some handling of individuals who are coping with the scarring of their physical bodies (through HIV or early-life wounds), but for whatever reason the director chose not to go into this type of relation too deeply.  The other thing we don't see is Spencer Tunick approaching locations where his art might actually be deemed dangerous by national institutions.  For the time being, if you want to get to why Tunick's work is exploitation you can simply address the absence of, for instance, the Mid-East.  Tunick arrives at scenes where the fundamentalist control structure has been laid to ruins, but never to where it still stands or is beginning to detioriate.  For what purpose does Spencer avoid locales where his art might have real impact?  There are plenty of answers, many justifiable, but the question is worth addressing for this artist who has turned the globe into his canvas and its people into his paint.  Overall though, an excellent tv special worth stopping for.

        Have Intercourse With Our Friends and Beat the Crap Out of Our Neighbors   At least, that's how this George W quote from a speech in Britain is bound to get picked up:  "It really is about time we started to realize who are allies are, who our enemies are, stick with the one and fight the other."  It must have sounded good in his head at the time.    Aside from when he really gets his mind set on something, Bush tends to be much more a grayscale thinker than he expresses himself to be.  This has been part of his PR problem since... well, since forever.  I imagine him seeing this kind of statement as grand and heroic rhetoric, a head coach in the locker room at halftime about to stage the biggest come-from-behind victory the world has ever seen.  After the show, he gives Condoleeza Rice a high five and like college buddies they point out the kick-ass-ed-ness of the sound bite.    I sincerely doubt Bush literally meant we're going to send the armed forces of all allied nations to massacre all non-allied nations.  But you can't use global struggle as a metaphor when global struggle is what you're addressing.  On a related note, it's times like these that we should read British papers like  urlLink The Guardian .  It allows us to see how the people being addressed are viewing how they're being addressed.  Reading them to get the most honest outlook (which I know many who do) is just as immature as trusting mainstream US media as the end-all be-all.  More on that later (if I can get myself riled up about it).

        Eat, Drink   Last Saturday, Kristi, some friends and I went downtown to eat at Lalo's, one of the River North food machines that caters with huge atmosphere and overpriced dinner plates.  Reservations for 9pm unwittingly turned into 9:45 and then 10:30 and could have become later if it weren't for the diligent pestering of Kris and Ben.  In a restaurant whose overall floor area is half-devoted to the bar, it is no wonder that reservations get bumped to a later spot.  Drinks from bars are already grossly inflated but tourist-gobbling enterprises like Lalo's jack it up another notch; so why not pocket a few extra dollars for a nudge of the reservation time?  In their defense, resaurants also don't want tables left open because of reservations where the diners are late and justifiably have to cushion what would be a loss.  But praying to the gods of chaos eventually incurs their arrival.  Not that Lalo's (or any busy restaraunt) really loses any money when things go awry.  For our wait, we were negotiated free drinks and some free appetizers, which have a high menu value but extremely low real cost.  The only person affected is the tangentially related waiter/ress whose guests might not tip for the menu value of the free items (we did).  So, I guess what I'm saying is to not specifically fear Lalo's but to hold a general wariness for any dinner factory and most restaurants.  The food, though, was just okay, so my feelings won't be hurt if you decide to never go there... except you'll be missing out on a fantastic paintings of boats sailing by a cross against a clouded map sky.

        Respect for Amnesty International   I would probably join the American Civil Liberties Union if it were not for a few pet issues which I feel have become politically motivated and are counter-productive to the key principles of the organization.  In conversation with people on the behaviors of the ACLU, I have often cited Amnesty International as having the kind of ideal apolitical atmosphere the ACLU  should  be striving for.  That said, I find  urlLink this Salon interview with Amnesty's US executive director William Schulz  to be very interesting.  Salon has chosen to sauce the tease (a term I made up and hope to use more frequently) to fire up its audience, but at its root the interview addresses the non-stance Amnesty International has taken on what the organization interprets to be political decisions.  Some interesting implication of the ethics involved in such decisions raise some debatable questions; for instance, should Amnesty International take a lesser-of-two-evils approach in certain cases? Of course, the edges are glittered up with sparkles to get the "antiwar left" dazzled in one way or another.

        Princes of the Universe   At  urlLink Penny Arcade , something has been written about the new Prince of Persia that makes me want to jump on my bike and ride down the frozen tundra of Clybourn and trade in all my old Game Cube games to purchase it.  O...  Since you are so curious, here is a little portion of what was written.  "If your game doesn't look as good, play as good, or just feel as good against my bare skin maybe it should never see the retail shelf."  So, a reminder.  I don't necessarily hate this type of criticism (although I don't think Tycho necessarily sees himself as a critic persay); in fact, I enjoy it.  Good article in  urlLink The Reader  this week about  urlLink Bookslut  that ever so subtly touches on the debate over the purpose and approach of literary criticism (Why couldn't it just go in that direction a tad more!?).  And it reminds me why I think we're so cool for trying to do what we're trying to do at RF (and what other underground zines are also stabbing at)...  Most normal places... Whether the criticism is too harsh, too soft, too true; it's all geared at the sale.  I love the fact that such criticism exists (this might go against RF 1.1's theme) and that I can hear/see beautiful praise or scorn laid at the altar of the works of man.  But there are times when I KNOW what I'll think of something and what I really want to learn about is what makes a work work.  I am at a point in my life where having my furnace and water heater explode at the same time seems like less strain than reading plot summaries and back catalogs in reviews.  Fluff.  Let's trim it so we can see the glorious beast underneath.  But yes.  Accolades and attacks are great fun, I eat them like they are ice cream.  I'll even eat tiramisu ice cream because I love ice cream so much.

        But the Water Main's Busted   New American Ninja Underground strip is up.  "Water Main" is probably my favorite ANU strip so far and I think is the best portrayal thus far of what I'm trying to do with the comic.  ANU is meant to be a humanized  urlLink Xiao Xiao .  Although the stick figure fights will be cool and stylish, my interest is more in telling a comic story about a bunch of ninjas trying to be ninjas in a world not made for ninjas.  I hate punchlines (gag frames and what-not) in comic strips.  Alright.  Let me correct that with a convoluted story.  In the first strip of my short-lived series,  In Pictorium , I wrote three frames of solid text about how the comic was never going to have a punchline; the fourth frame said, "Oh.  How about a picture?"  It was a stick figure sketch of a drunk man and a crow and a chicken on some grass.  This is to say:  I'm not necessarily opposed to gag frames or punchlines, but I don't think a comic strip should read like a joke.  A regular-running comic strip depends on the notion of each strip being just a piece of a large body of work.  This is true even if there are not regular characters persay, because the narrator and the themes become the continuity.  With  In Pictorium , the worst strip I ever did was one where the intrusive self-analyzing writing of the narrator was replaced with thought bubbles of the comic's central figure.  Although the structure of the humor and the visual style were exactly the same as in previous outings, I had lost the strip by thinking each  In Pictorium  could depend on those two principles and stand individually.  I was wrong.  In a continuing comic, there is assumed story around a strip and to be most effective, the author needs to depend on this story in structuring these individual parts.   Calvin and Hobbes  is the example I keep thinking of...  Bill Watterson used the continuity of his strips to ground his humor. i.e.  He didn't have to force a joke on the surface; instead he depended on his characters' natural responses to create the humor.  The way he structured strips could change dramatically day-to-day, but each strip acted as just a part of something bigger.  To put it most clearly, though...  A strip didn't make sense just at it's conclusion; it made sense in every frame.  And that's what I like about "Water Main".  The final frame is the climax of a joke and the strip is at some root level a build-up to that gag.  Even if you haven't read any other ANU strip though, you know there is more than "Water Main" going on.  The apex feels good, but all the other frames are doing more than leading-up to that point.  We are getting a better idea of who the characters are, as well...  Cyd's as-of-yet-unamed wife, continues to be confrontational towards the ANU's boys club behavior, Cyd himself continues to be a guy getting pushed around by these two powerful halves of his life, and we meet Peter Travers for the second time...  Cool and deadly serious about his craft.  It just has a great sense continuity while pushing the story critically forward.  What Gary Larson did in the  Far Side  is a different creature altogether though.  The major difference being that  The Far Side   was  gag strips.  Larson, however, managed to establish strip continuity in ways which I have not thought about hard enough to fully explain.  But, his strips were not simply jokes, and anyone who has read the strip can probably attest to each piece really feeling like a piece of the entire body of work.  If you have any thoughts on this, please post in the  urlLink forum  and I'll be sure to respond.   urlLink A Modest Destiny  is a neat strip that I think is structured very well; if you're ever looking for something fun to read on a boring day go back to day one and read the catalog thus far.  Anyone who would enjoy it has probably heard of it, but  urlLink Penny Arcade  is another online exclusive that generally works well at deemphasizing the final frame gag.

        The Spirit of Jackass Alive and Kickin?   I preface by saying, I've been away from MTV for a long, long time...  Although Johnny Knoxville has left the hijinx of Jackass, MTV is gratefully reluctant to let go of the weird assortment of talent they had surrounded the turn-of-the-century underground legend with.  Yes, Jackass spin-offs have hit the tube and it's a funny thing considering the original show was the exact opposite.  Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  Breaking up the circus has allowed for some things that worked well on the original series to be fleshed out.  The adventures of Steve-O and Chris "Party Boy" Pontius with Manny, a kind of wildlife guide from the So Florida episodes, are turned into a half-assed, tongue-in-cheek nature show.  I'm sure this will be said of it ten million times, but it's the Crocodile Hunter if the Aussie gator guru were an actual idiot.  There's a bad catch-22 working against the show though, the "Wild Boyz" can't hurt the animals but the animals are totally willing to hurt and/or kill them.  So, there's not the same kind of idiotic danger as in Jackass...  but, sometimes, it still manages to be funny.  When Steve-O had eggs from a dead salmon squirted in his mouth and then salmon semen squirted all over his face, I laughed.  Pretty loudly too.  The other show is Viva La Bam.  Which I have not witnessed yet, but which presumably follows the Margera family's psychological torture at the hands of Bam Margera.  Sundays, I believe, if anyone needs another show to clog up their Sunday evening viewing.

        All the Prophets in the House   Carnivale has opened a mighty big metaphysical can of worms on its viewers as the battle to inevitably be waged between good and evil begins to unveil itself.  This is a show with an almost painful patience at revealing its characters, as if it's saying "You are about to witness one of the most collossal conflicts in the history of the universe.  Let's make sure you fully understand what brought every piece into place for it to happen."  The allure of, say, the Sopranos is in waiting to see what will become of Tony Soprano...  Sure, hints have been dropped that the show will end in Big T's demise, but we have no idea where that will come from.  Also.  Tony has been working towards remedying his feeling of the end being nigh both practically and psychologically.  So, there are no guarantees.  Instead we watch to see where the characters will bring themselves.  Carnivale is different in that we have the feeling that we are seeing a history of the story; we don't have a full character sketch for any of the major players at this point, but revelations to who they are gradually given.  Even within an episode we see this structure; we don't understand the relevance of things until the conclusion (even then, we oftentimes are only assured that items will have relevance to the grand conclusion).  Anyway.  We've hit a point where we know enough that we can actually talk about what's going on in the show and not just stare at each blankly and say, "What the hell just happened?"

        Critical Mass   Friday night I participated in the October edition of  urlLink Critical Mass .  For those not in the know--basically everyone--Critical Mass is a bike trek through Chicago's busy streets during Friday rush hour with many hundreds of bicycles.  It is one of the strangest (or most frustrating) things you will ever see and honestly one of the most fun to participate in.  The line of bikes, once the mass gets moving, stretches at least five city blocks, and although the front line stops appropriately at traffic lights the rest will keep moving through red intersections in order to keep the line together (done partly for safety, partly for order, partly for the fun of it).  Arguably the best part of the ride is the reaction to it.  The majority of witnesses fall into the puzzled and/or awestruck category... Bar patrons plaster the windows or spill out into the sidewalk, pedestrians step to the curve to get a closer look or to question riders breaking to the side, car passengers think they've lost their minds.  After all, the streets, which we associate with the dangerous, accelerating iron-grid of automobiles has been pacified by an endless stream of pedal-powered skeletons.  Part of the wonder of even participating in the event is this dramatic reversal of authority.  Even if the corking of traffic frustrates you to no end, there is little to say or do aside from just watching it all go by.  Howerver, some people are, I suppose, in denial.  They will honk (which is greeted by the "woo"-ing of passing cyclists), try to inch their way through the mass (which is greeted by one excited cyclists pulling to a stop directly in front of them, thus ceasing the car's forward movement), or in extreme cases, get out of their car and try to pick a fight with their halting rider (which is greeted by swarming bicycles demanding for the individual to get back into their car).  Normally, routes are planned ahead of time and pretty much stuck to, but a few "tricks" in this month's map ended up bringing the ride into a benevolent chaos as the ride was given its own life on a wandering exodus from Daley Plaza.  The group I was with for most of the ride ended up experiencing a radically different conclusion to the ride than I did after we were separated --DUE TO THE INTENSE SPEED AT WHICH I RIDE!!! -- but both concluded with a practical party social in the middle of triangle intersections.  They got bagels though.  (There were probably 3-4 different packs by the end of the ride.)  For more on the Mass, check out the website :  urlLink Chicago Critical Mass  or drop me an e-mail.

        Dorks in Sweaters   Headline has nothing to do with anything.  But.  I'm going to be writing for the comics section of the pretty major web-zine  urlLink Pop Matters .  It's a very exciting prospect for me, and I'm currently weighing some other neat options outside of Robots Fighting.  Again.  RF is going to become a more experimental publication and I think we'll all be better because of it.

        Sick   I'm sick.  I'm either not sick ever or just slightly sick all the time, but either way I don't get like this so often.  But when I do I can I feel my body fighting itself, which oftentimes gets personified in my dreams with whatever strategy game I'm playing.  I remember having some horrible nights reliving Starcraft and Command and Conquer scenarios.  Most ended up with me dashing to the bathroom to puke.  Warcraft has been much nicer to me and has held the diseases in check better.  Am I just better at Warcraft and so can use it to command my white blood cells more effetively?  Not likely.

        Shake it like a Polaroid picture!!!   "This is my happy song," my cousin Tim turned to me and said as I did about as much getting down as is possible for a bundled up white boy constrained to a seat in a freezing Soldier Field.  "It's probably everyone's happy song right now," I responded like a jerk on the subject of Outkast's "Hey Ya!"  Even though the song has become love-it-or-tired-of-it party driving vernacular and Tim Martens' official Happy Song, I've been wondering about how really happy the song is.  Somewhere between the body moving hand claps and peppy guitar strumming and the get-unmoving-bodies-moving call and response, there's real despair in the song.  The lyrics, about the seeming impossibility of love being able to hold two people together for long, tends to show that.  Even if we aren't paying attention to (or making out) the lyrics the first hundred thousand times, the song still reaks of a melancholy darkness.  Just listen to the wilting delivery of the title phrase, or the eerie lonely echoes of the chorus chimes and Andre's calls.  But it's a song that overwhelming makes us feel happy.  Do we find joy in this celebration of our mortality?  Do we just ignore the song's mood of impending disaster so that we can clap along?  What does either say about our relationship with music as it relates to ourselves?  Is it even worth thinking about or should I shut up and dance?  Hey ya!

        The Times They are a Changing   A little forewarning.  I'm making the move to fold the creative writing of Robots Fighting into Dmitry's xpehb.com .  This is the first part of a number of moves which will be enhancing the experimental aspects of RF, and will be a major move in establishing the magazine.  Regular features will be bolstered but organization will be less formal, making more room for informal experiments in presentation while keeping a focus on interesting style.  I want to create a sort of frontier of writing and visual art that can be explored and consistently be filled with surprises.  I don't want people to say, "Who the hell is Tim Howard?" and never read about his approach to songwriting.  I want readers to stumble upon things and make connections and most importantly feel like RF is a place, that it is as intended a sandbox in a warzone.  I also want more psychological freedom for myself.  A magazine is measured in issues and volumes and for a personal project like RF, I don't want to get caught up in an expectation of linear production.  As I've come to realize, I dig myself into holes in order to dig myself out of holes.  If I can produce laterally...  spend 8 hours working on a cryptic flash animation or the script to a comic book and not feel that what i needed to do is finish that Shattered Glass review.  The way I work, I feel the refocused concept for the RF website will actually help me improve production.  I know that may sound odd.  But that's my thinking.  Anway, Dmitry is being given a great amount of access to my creative writing, so a lot of poems which were only ever publicly read or printed up for classes will get an expanded audience.  I am excited to be able to share a lot of these pieces to a bigger audience, and I continue to commend Dmitry for the exquisite site he produces.

        You and Me Were Never Meant to be Part of the Future   The great grandmother of a gaming clanmate passed away several days ago.  Although he's not one that I have gotten to really know yet, I've been trying to think of some encouraging words to pass on to him.  At funerals we often end up mourning the inability of a person to continue with us, instead of accepting the ceasing of that person's mortal walk and seeing their place here for what it was in the past.  Maybe I am fond of the latter idea because of the solace I find in the theology of and surrounding predestination, but I think there's a certain truth to it no matter what your doctrine or creed is.  That said.  I would like to have the Flaming Lips play at my funeral.  I am officially abandoning my prior request to be trebuchet'ed into the sunset, but I do with great sincerity thank those who kept this knowledge with them.  You have done a great service to me and I am indebted to you.  I abandon that plan because looking back it seems less romantic and more a giant logistical hassle for everyone involved in planning.  I mean, if you can make it happen... great, I appreciate it.  But you can move it out of the special request category.  Anyway.  The Flaming Lips.  Really, if they could just play Do You Realize I think I'd be happy enough (knowing this would happen), because that song captures in a moment the way I feel death should be universally dealt with better than many others.  "Do you realize - that everyone you know someday will die - and instead of saying all your goodbyes - let them know that life goes fast it's hard to make the good times last."  That is, to me, you can't get caught up in the finality of mortal things, you make the best of the moments you share and you share the understanding that there's no reason to waste mortal time bidding farewell...  "The sun doesn't go down, it's just an illusion caused by the world spinning 'round."  So that's that.  If they want to play a couple other songs, I'm cool with that but see if they can somehow not make my traditional relatives walk away saying, "That was weird."  Because it's for them as much as it is for anyone else.  As much as I might like them to appreciate that weirdness, it's not necessarily a forum they should be doused with it in.  A bit like how Christianity is handled in the same situation; it's laid out for anyone who wants to understand the calm it brings those who embrace it, but you don't have altar calls and trash like that.  I'm still hanging onto having "Be Thou My Vision" played, but I wouldn't want the Lips to be forced into it unless they were really feeling it.  If they are, word.  If not, you can try to pick up Pedro the Lion or just whoever has the song in their blood.  But don't have Kirk Jackson or Michelle LaGroue sing "Do You Realize?"...  They have wonderful voices, but I really wouldn't feel right about it not being The Flaming Lips.  Of course, what do you care?  I'm dead.

        Digital Millenium    urlLink Yet another story  of a guardian getting the lawsuit for a child's Kazaa downloading.  Intellectual property lawyers who have the upbringing and understanding of digital issues may still be too young to make a difference in the courtroom, so it is disheartening to see the media (generally considered younger and hipper) failing so miserably to alter perception of file-sharing.  Stories of people too stupid to make a plausible argument only make the broader battle more difficult.  The lady in the story above, for instance, has decided that her best vocal defense is to ignore the issue altogether...  As if pretending she doesn't have to settle or fight will make the lawsuit disappear.  How zen.  Grandparents, working class moms, 12 year old teeny-boppers... these faces are meant to elicit sympathy against the big bad wolf of the RIAA... but it's not what we need.  Watching straw and stick huts fall isn't going to spark people.  Make a story out of a house made of brick; somebody who's standing their ground and might actually have a shot at holding their own.  There's gotta be such a case somewhere...  The anti-share defense is so simple and so ignorant of legal sharing that I find it hard believe that someone in the position to do so is not closing in on not just a loophole but a solid legal stance for peer-to-peer.

        Killing in the Name of   A number of gaming sites have been reporting with a not-so-subtle flair of irony the release of  Medal of Honor: Rising Sun  in Japan.  The game, developed in America, places the player in the role of American soldiers during World War II's Pacific Campaign...  You know, the one where the US fought the Japanese.  Game Girl Advance's write-up and discussion on the release is  urlLink here .  The basic questions stem from Japanese players simulating the slaying of what could in real-life have been their fathers, uncles, grandfathers, etc.  There is generally this type of pondering when a game based on recent historical conflict is released, but this debate is possibly greater because it relates to a work in the birthing place of the art form.  Now, I don't want to say this is a non-issue, because there are without a doubt a number of very interesting issues involved with this release of  Rising Sun .  But.  When a person plays a video game, they are knowingly entering a fiction...  No matter how detailed and realistic it may be, it is a known fiction.  This is what allows a gamer to "kill" in the video game world and never give even a thought to killing someone in the physical world.  We play  Grand Theft Auto  or even  Midtown Madness  with an understanding that oncoming cars could--in the real world--potentially be us or our families...   There is a definitive line between fact and fiction; although we may try to blur it, although we may astonish audiences by nudging them closer to the line than they have previously witnessed anything go, it is there.  Our maturity is in some ways measured by our ability to discern each side of this line, and it is definitively immature to claim that a Japanese player is killing a relative while playing a somewhat accurate portrayal of World War II's Pacific Campaign.  Or... to claim that there is betrayal against the nation in fighting against Japan within the game.  The problem is in a critic's application of the player's reality onto the fiction of the game.  The avatar and the player are two separate entities and such projection ignores this.  While I eat a bean burrito from Taco Bell, my character could be starving in Siberia.  As much as the game or I may try to trick my mind in order to make the game's fiction more absorbing, any bond between character and player is an artificial one.  While my character dies from a gruesome head wound, I sit in an upholstered chair at a computer desk sipping a glass of milk.  While an enemy may be killed in the game world, its code still exists just as it did before and can be resurrected by simply reseting a level or the game entirely (and arguably, just by coming across an identical enemy).  If I kill in the real world, I wipe out the code for that being; there will be no revival or cloning.  It's gone.  By nature, the deletion of a crappy game from your harddrive is closer to real-world killing than in-game slayings.  Shouldn't it be considered more morally absurd to kill the avatar of a friend down the street in multiplay, than to halt an autonomous character?  Well, maybe not... because both events are equally part of an entirely fictitious universe.  Again, our eyes may be fooled by pretty particle effects, but the game is still fiction.  Only in the most tremendous of  urlLink Philip K. Dick  stories, does the line between the real and the artificial become blurred to an extent that there is a problem of morality.  The key to these stories, though, is the erasure of an individual's memory of entry into the fiction.  But the  Rising Sun  issue is one based not on morality but on business (specifically, marketing).  How do you get Japanese players interested in the  Rising Sun  story?  Once they decide to play the game, they are knowingly entering a fiction.  It's getting there that's the tough part.  If we try to turn fiction into reality and force ourselves to put real constraints upon the fiction, we destroy the purpose of it ever existing in the first place.  No longer could we explore the  un real.  And that's the real danger.

        Just Be In Love When You Scream That Song, I    Some songs I've been enjoying lately:   "Staring at the Sun" - TV on the Radio  : like The Polyphonic Spree if they were stuck in a factory machine   "Now It's On" - Grandaddy  : possibly  the  single of 2k3 (after Hey Ya), also possibly the only band able to make geek-tech themed music that isn't geeky   "Be Thou My Vision" - Pedro the Lion  : a little awkward at first, but a nice reworking of the hymm to emphasize the human frailty of the narrator   "Last Night It Snowed" - Ass Ponys  : mainly because I've been able to mimic the titular line perfectly, but it's a good song anyway   "Last Call" - Outkast  : a tough guy hip hop track that's still suave as hell   "Sinking Ship" - Soltero  : at the end of a long night of painful drinking, lift your last pint of Guiness and sing unintelligbly along with this song.  skip the "woos" and stumble out of the bar.  this is how you make an exit.   "Cinematic" - Erin McKeown  : i'm a sucker for ms mckeown's music, and that's the real issue here.  a fast, light, maybe even agile song.   "Kingpin" - Wilco  : i wanna be... your king pin...   livin in...  PEKIN.   "Anything For Love" - Robbie Fulks  :  how this song is even possible beats me.  clean-cut noise folk with soul.  at least, i think that's what i hear.

        A Man of My Word   So, I followed a link from the Windows Media Player media guide today.  I swear, it isn't something I usually do but how do you resist a link that reads "Bustin' a Move for the Pope?"  You don't.  It is your duty as a good Catholic to find out who is bustin' what moves and how the Pope reacted.  (where and when are also important but to a lesser extent)  The thirty second clip features some Polish guy breakin' on the palace floor in front of the Pope throne.  He wasn't bad but I'm not about to adapt it into a full length screen play.    The real reason to watch the movie is to see the aging John Paul himself.  There he is with his Pope cap on his Pope throne watching some jackass spin on his head when he reaches up his hand and does the Pope wave.  Done from a balcony or Pope-mobile, this gesture is a pious expression of welcome.  Done towards someone in the middle of popping and locking, it looks like an especially God-Fearing "I feel you dawg."    The Windows Media Player wouldn't let me snag a direct link to the content, but searching for the terms "pope break dance" on the media guide will take you to the good stuff.

        The Dailies   Just discovered, thanks to my RealVid install (wait, am I thanking Real?) that  urlLink Comedycentral.com  has been doing a very nice job of archiving Daily Show headline segments.  I always end up missing the actual show (Comedy Central is in what we call the "fuzzy high channels" on my TV), so it's a nice resource.  Also, I'd like more details on this, but apparently The Daily Show pulled together a panel of media higher-ups for  urlLink spirited discussion .  The CNN story I've linked is only good for a couple chuckles, no actual information on the event.

       Yes, politics is an inbred pile of skin tissue, focussed more on "our party, our country" (a term I just made up and hope to use more frequently in the future) rhetoric than on actual issues (they are getting worked out somewhere inside the epidermal lump, but it's pretty well hidden from us).  But sometimes, rhetorical analysis handled properly can be insightful.   urlLink James Fallows' notes on the State of the Union   By the way, pick up the current "State of the Union" issue of The Atlantic while it is still on newsstands; by far, the best magazine being produced today.

        The RealMark of the Beast   Well, it's happened.  I've installed Real Player again after avoiding it like the armageddon for the past year and a half.  I can already hear my computer crying about having its will broken by the software program...  Real Player does what it wants no matter what you tell it.  Want WinAmp to keep control of mp3's?  TOO BAD, REAL IS RUNNING THE SHOW NOW!  To cap it off, the introductory audio clip tells you, "YOU'RE IN CONTROL of the most powerful media player..."  And you have to ask yourself...  If it's so powerful, why does it let a fragile user like me control it?  The answer:  IT LIES TO YOU.  This is the true sign of power.

        Water, Water Everywhere   Just when you thought the Mars craze had passed, you get contact reestablished with Spirit (see Andy's post below) and the Europeans have apparently  urlLink confirmed water on Mars  (the last time you heard about it, it was just a suspiscion presumably).  My hope is that we can blame water on Mars on an impact-created exchange of molecules with Earth.  Let me tell you why.  As someone who writes and enjoys science fiction in a variety of forms, my fantasies are reliant on the idea that we are, as far as we know, alone.  For one thing, this allows a region of mystery which one can fill with fiction.  If we meet a bunch of lizard-chimps on Mars who tell us "You know what, we've traveled f-in everywhere and there are no f-in wookies," well, our ability to dream that there are wookies is hampered.  For another, our entire relationship with the universe radically changes.  Even if all we find are microbes or maybe tuna fish, they become an integral part of the story of us and the universe.  It's like if you were to write stories about life in your apartment and suddenly your dying cousin Larry moves into your bedroom...  Larry now figures into your stories; even if you never have meaningful conversations with Larry and generally despise him, you're stuck with him being part of your apartment life.  You can't just write him out of the story, because, well, he's dying and that's a rude thing to do to someone terminally ill.  This is how it will be with the microbes.  You'll look up at the stars at night and think about the millions and millions of miles of nothing but burning gas and floating rocks and, oh yeah, a bunch of parasites next door.  And when we finally discover some hot, super intelligent aliens half way across the universe, we're going to have to bring them home to our solar system and introduce them to the microbes, who will do nothing but swim in circles and drool.  What are we going to do?  Ignore them?  They're life!  You can ignore Jupiter, you can ignore Pluto... but you can't ignore life.  It just doesn't happen too often.  And it happened twice in the same solar system and you want to forget about it?    No.  Impossible.  Life on Mars is going to be a part of our day-to-day interstellar realities whether we ask for it or not.  We could hope that it won't be found, even though we would really like the initial thrill of discovery...  Which is why I can only root for life on Mars to be some kind of backwash of the cosmos.  And now you know.

        The General vs. the President   I watched the entire Democratic New Hampshire debate last night because I'm a nerd and was a poltical science major.  Anyway, all throughout the debate I kept thinking, "Is it possible for anyone to do  worse  in a debate than Wesley Clark is doing tonight?"  It was as if he didn't expect to actually be asked questions.  He had no answer for numerous inqueries, embarassed himself in trying to explain away Michael Moore's comments on Bush, and relied on stupid cliches all night long.  (My favorite?  "This election is about the future, and that's why we're here tonight."  Thanks, General.)  I was shocked at his answer to Peter Jennings question about Michael Moore calling George Bush a deserter while onstage with Clark.  The General basically said he didn't think it was relevant, didn't bother to check the facts, and thought Michael Moore had a right to say whatever he wants (Don't infringe on our free speech!  Even if it is factually wrong!!)  Clark is a General in the United States Army and someone is calling his Commander In Chief a deserter right in front of him while campaining for his presidency.   Clarks says he doesn't care and it's not even relevant to him.  Probably because Moore is such a great "leader."  His word, not mine.  Anyway, the  National Review's  Byron York has a great column on this same subject.   urlLink Byron York on Wesley Clark in the debate

        The Red Menace   Good news urlLink   from the Gusev Crater: after a scary day and a half, Spirit, NASA's robotic Mars exploration rover, has reestablished contact with an eager flight team here on Earth.  The contact came early this morning in the form of a 20 minute data burst broadcast from the red planet.  For the scores of scientists involved in the project, this means the hundreds of millions of dollars and countless man hours put into landing the rover on Mars won't be wasted after only a few weeks of exploration.  More importantly, for me, this means more mind blowing, high quality images of Mars.  Since Spirit touched down on the third, I have spent about half an hour of every morning studying the latest pictures and reading press releases about the minutiae of the Martian landscape.  I have never spent this much time on a .gov website before.  In fact, before the Mars project, I can't say I've ever spent any serious amount of time on a US government endorsed website.    This has major implications for our president.  His administration is in charge of one of the most popular websites on the Internet (as of today it is ranked 302 on Alexa) and there isn't anything on the site that connects him to it.  Think about it, every day thousands of nerds visit this site and try to found out as much about Mars as they can.  What if they also found out that George W. Bush supports the search for signs of extra-terrestrial life and is dedicated to furthering our understanding of our universe through blah, blah, blah, vote for Bush.  It doesn't matter that he's taking credit for something he doesn't have a whole lot to do with.  Politicians do it all the time.  It worked for Gore, didn't it?  I can't say that I voted for W. his first time around or that I plan to vote for him in November, but if he were to change the focus of his campaign from the War on Terror to the War on Space, I might at least watch one of his debates.

In the article Seth MacFarlane says: "We're sort of waiting on an official word, but to the best of my knowledge, the plan is to start producing a batch of new episodes without necessarily knowing where they're going to wind up." Several options are open for the eventual home of the new episodes including Fox, or the Cartoon Network, but eventually they will end up on DVD.  Click for  urlLink the New York Post article .

        Remember the Vernacular   Or sometimes the best laid plans ignore the actual geography.  I at once cringed and laughed a few years ago when Malcom X College here in Chicago had the slogan "Capping Off the Millenium" on banners around their urban campus, somehow missing the double entendre in the street definition of  urlLink cap .  On Saturday, it happened again.  Marshall Field's ran an ad in honor of Martin Luther King Jr, which was filled with excruciating iconography. The worst of which read in big wood-cut Soviet-style lettering:  Celebrate  urlLink THE MAN  (and then smaller text which cleared up that the man was Martin Luther King Jr)  I know the phrase is somewhat common, but the ad's large and equal emphasis on THE MAN seems to allude more to  urlLink Urban Dictionary's definition  than to the traditional honorary phrase, especially when coupled with a typeface reminiscent of a cruel and faceless regime.  Perhaps it's unfair of me, but in both these cases I'm puzzled as to how such copy/design escapes the various levels of the editorial process...  Someone somewhere along the line must recognize that the wording or design emphasis could be changed to avoid embarassing puns in the vernacular of the target audience.  Do they knowingly reject such interpretation, or is it just a mistake of circumstance?  I have a hard time fully believing either.

        Trebuchet Snobbery and the Return of the King   A common misuse of the  urlLink trebuchet  in cinema is the siege weapon's combative use against ground troops.  As any trebuchet hobbyist will tell you, the easiest way to explain a treb to someone is to refer to it as a catapult and yet the two have very little in common aside from their basic hurling purpose.  A catapult (onager, mangonel, what have you), generally perceived properly, is a tension mounted device used to hurl heavy objects for moderate distances... It's target is pretty much up to chance, so a catapult is most effective against large groupings of enemy forces and large or light structures.  A trebuchet, however, is a long-range sling-based weapon known for its precision; it can not fire as quickly (changing trajectory and distance are also a more involved process) as a catapult nor can it carry multiple ammunitions in one firing.  The trebuchet was/is used against heavy, preferably stationary fortifications; it can hit these with more force and accuracy than a catapult would ever be capable of.  While a trebuchet is certainly capable of firing on ground forces, the excess power and precision is superfluous (a giant boulder does not have to be moving too fast to flatten a human), the sacrifice of speed and area-of-effect of shots would be too great to be effective.  That said, one has to wonder what the defenders of Middle Earth's Minas Tirith (P. Jackson version) were thinking when installing trebuchets along its walls for city defense.  Ye gods!  The only way such a thing would be worth while is if Sauron's tower sprouted hen's legs and began marching on the city itself.  In  Return of the King , we watch as a few boulders crush a few targets but against half the army of Mordor such scattered shots are inconsequential.  If only onagers had been installed along the front and secondary walls!  Or ballistae along the fortress' gates!  So many lives would have been saved.  Case in point, it took legions of the dead devouring all in their path to tilt the battle towards the human side in the movie version of  Return of the King , while the books' army of man (presumably, armed with proper knowledge of siege warfare) needed the dead only to tangentially capture Mordorian ships in order to succeed.  What a difference a siege makes.

        Memo on More (Moore?) Blogging   Scot never got the memo about RF being apolitical, but that's okay.  Readers will need to get used to his incendiary rhetoric at some point or another, and it's best to start with something simple like Michael Moore.  Scot's a Michael Moore defector; he used to swear by  Roger and Me  and  Awful Truth .  But then, even long before  Bowling for Columbine , Scot saw Moore start to go a little loopy (maybe he'll tell us the story).  And here we are.  For more on Moore (pun of the day?), check out  urlLink Spinsanity ; there you will find some of the most independent-minded indictments of Moore playing fast and loose with the truth (a phrase which is now forbidden for the rest of 2004).  To be a dork for a second, I would like to explain each of the three current blog team member's in Dungeons and Dragons alignment terms (the idea was given to me by my manager at work, who is a serious but respectable D&D player).  I am replacing Good and Evil with right and left or left and right (it is inconsequential really), but Chaotic, Lawful and Neutral will remain the same.  Scot is Lawful Right, Andy is probably somewhere around Lawful Left and True Neutral and I like to think I am somewhere between True Neutral and Neutral Right.  I think there's a lot we can learn about politics through Dungeons and Dragons, but I'm not really qualified to make that post.

        Scot on Moore on Clark   Apparently, I will be posting here now too, introduction by Mike or not.    This is a test post.  This is only a test.  But to make it worthwhile, a few notes about crazy Michael Moore's endorsement of Wesley Clark.  First of all, if I were Clark, I'd decline the endorsement, but that's not going to happen.  Moore sent out an e-mail explaining his reasons for support.  A few of the highlights:   1. Clark has committed to ensuring that every family of four who makes under $50,000 a year pays NO federal income tax. None. Zip. This is the most incredible helping hand offered by a major party presidential candidate to the working class and the working poor in my lifetime. He will make up the difference by socking it to the rich with a 5% tax increase on anything they make over a million bucks.    This is Moore's main thrust in his current incarnation (besides not responding when terrorists attack us): class warfare.  The left has no new ideas, no passion, no drive, no real support in working class America for their radical anti-war stance.  So, it comes down to taxing the rich.  "Socking it to them," as Mike says.  What have the rich done to deserve this?  Well, they've been successful in life.  They've worked hard to accumulate wealth.  They are the success stories in this country.  And the reward is paying 5% extra in income taxes.  What about the family of three making under $50,000?  Are they less deserving of a tax break than a family of four?      2. He is 100% opposed to the draft. If you are 18-25 years old and reading this right now, I have news for you -- if Bush wins, he's going to bring back the draft. He will be forced to. Because, thanks to his crazy war, recruitment is going to be at an all-time low. And many of the troops stuck over there are NOT going to re-enlist. The only way Bush is going to be able to staff the military is to draft you and your friends. Parents, make no mistake about it -- Bush's second term will see your sons taken from you and sent to fight wars for the oily rich. Only an ex-general who knows first-hand that a draft is a sure-fire way to wreck an army will be able to avert the inevitable.   Well, there's a lot of lies in that paragraph.  Bush will not bring back the draft.  Recruitment is up right now.  And in fact, re-enlistment is supassing the Army's goals.  That's right.  More troops in Iraq are re-enlisting than even the Army expected.  DOn't believe me?  Unlike what Moore would do, here's an actual link to facts:   urlLink http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=17852&archive=true   Another of Mr. Moore's reasons:    3. He is anti-war. Have you heard his latest attacks on Bush over the Iraq War? They are stunning and brilliant. I want to see him on that stage in a debate with Bush -- the General vs. the Deserter!    Excuse me, (cough, cough) Mike. You might want to read this:   http://www.drudgereport.com/mattwc.htm   Those attacks for the war are also stunning and brilliant!   Mike's never been afraid to play fast and loose with the truth though.  That feels about right for a first post.  Let's see if this works.

        The Way Things Ought (Not?) To Be   Today my grandmoms and regularmom came out for lunch and visit.  At lunch, our crossing conversation had me and my mom discussing a new addition to her sewing machine (it is, to my credit, a very high tech sewing machine) while my grandmas, one in a pink sweatshirt the other wearing a soft white sweater, discussed the weekend's playoff football action.   Palindrome Speaking   Two guys sitting next to us were talking about home furnishing and one said to the other, "They are the nicest wood floors I have ever seen.  And I said that to him, I said, 'These are the nicest wood floors I have ever seen.'"  I do this occasionally but it made me smile to know others fall into the trap as well.  Palindrome speaking (a term which I just invented and hope to use regularly) is an awkward, dull and clumsy part of rhetoric, but there is something...   neat  about it.

        For Those Who Have Rocked   Thought I'd pass on an excerpt from this week's Tuesday Morning Quarterback (see link to the left, or simply look on nfl.com) which shows the kind of thing commenators  should  be pointing out to you.  It's these guys' JOB to watch football and tell you what's happening.  DEMAND MORE!   The Panthers called a three-man rush. Marshall Faulk cut-blocked Carolina DE Mike Rucker, diving at him low; Rucker responded by jumping on top of Faulk. Brilliant play! Why? Watch Rams film and you will note Faulk often cut-blocks a DE to get underneath him while selling pass-blocking, then jumps up to catch a screen pass. Rucker knew this, and simply sat on Faulk so he couldn't get up. Marc Bulger just stood there holding the ball, wondering where Faulk has disappeared to. Carolina ended up with a sack that effectively ended the first half -- although with Rucker seated atop Faulk, at that point the Panthers had only two gentlemen rushing against five offensive linemen.

        For Those About to Rock   Maybe it's mostly chance, but there's got to be some kind of skilled craftwork in FOX's coverage of the Green Bay vs. Seattle game.  One astounding replay showed a closeup of Brett Favre in the center of the screen with D.D. Lewis' back taking up the bottom right corner...  You see Lewis jump a little early and Brett Favre look directly at him and realize the threat.  Favre stops counting and makes a change up.  Now, the chances of a FOX camera man catching this moment perfectly composed like it was are slim.  The chances of a producer catching the moment in enough time to kick it up to the announcers to specifically comment on are even slimmer.  But there it was on my TV screen.  Yes, this is the number one coverage team and this kind of thing should be expected, but they still deserve a hats off for this shot.  I've been wishing that football commentary for the playoffs (and in general) was a little bit more like what FOX did with the baseball playoffs (and world series), where the network brought in a pitcher for the Mets (I can't remember his name; apologies to him and his family).  Said pitcher was detailed in explaining the strategy and method of pitching throughout the game, leaving anyone listening to FOX's coverage a little more learned.  Many (including me) are under the impression that football is all emotion and drive, because that's all announcers can talk about.  Their ability to explain what quarterbacks are seeing, how blocks are working or why defensive schemes are working is virtually non-existent.  So few actually understand the complexities of the strategies of the game and believe solely in hype.  Chris Collinsworth.... Don't tell us that "angels are still floating above this Green Bay Packers team".  I have seen you on Inside the NFL and I know you know more about what's happened than that.   Clarify-cation   I guess I should put the real emphasis in my Soap entry on drug stores.  I generally find soap in grocery stores (but I do think it takes longer than it should).

        Soap   Does anyone else find it incredibly difficult to find a bar of soap in a drug or grocery store?  If not, I have to doubt that you've ever tried.  I spent a half-hour at Osco today looking for some soap.  What I ended up with is a Neutrogena POWER SCRUB or some sort of thing.  It's basically tiny soap in a dish sponge.  But it's the closest not-hotel-size thing I could find.  How can there be ten thousand types of shampoo for every "type" of hair and there be no basic rudimentary soap?  I don't understand.  There's not even that much body wash (which is a joke... more perfumes and less actual soap to actually get you clean... this is WHY you need to have 13 stages of cleansing substances to open your pores....  because you're coating yourself in flowery feces).  ANGER!

        Please don't sing us a melody   A fairly big pet peeve of mine is when when people sing along to pop songs (whether they be rock, hip-hop, country... whatever) in their "pretty voices."  Yesterday, one of my coworkers was singing very melodically along with the Beatles "I'm Looking Through You" in this soft, passionate way like it was "Yesterday" or "Amazing Grace".  The problem is that the glory of the imperfections is lost; "You're not the same," instead of being this coarse, assertive holler that -ahem- fits the music turns into this loungey whine.  Blegh.  My favorite part of "Build Me Up Buttercup" is the "WhhhhYYYYY do you..."  Specifically, the "WhhhhYYYY" because it's a dry. strained exhale that just builds all the tension for the chorus.  This part gets mauled by sing-alongs all the time.  It's like the entire song is getting sold out in one second.  And these are the most fun parts to sing.  So, I just cannot stand it when someone sings over them with their crappy, trying not to sound crappy crap crap voices.  I mean, what fun is singing along with Bob Dylan if you don't contort your voice like a Cirque De Soleil clown...  What's the use of a rendition of "Beast of Burden" without an accentuated imitation of Mick Jagger singing "Pre Ty Pre Ty Pre Ty Pre Ty."  There are people out there wasting the best moments of pop music with their classically-trained for karaoke voices;  IT NEEDS TO STOP!

        Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice...   William Ligue, Jr., the man who attacked Kansas City Royals coach Tom Gamboa two years ago,  urlLink violated his probabtion over the weekend.   What a surprise.  Ligue allegedly tested positive for marijuana three times during the month of December, and will now, god willing, head to prison.  Prosecutors urged the judge in the case to give Ligue jail time to begin with, but the judge gave him probabation.  Since then, the state of Illinois has passed a law making it a felony to illegally enter restricted areas, such as a playing field, basketball court, locker room or stage. A violation carries up to three years in prison and a fine of at least $1,000.  Ligue used the death of his infant daughter to explain away his actions from that night, saying he turned to drugs after her death.  (No word if Ligue had another infant daughter die in November of this year)  He was under the influence of five drugs that night, including cocaine, marijuana and Valium.  While chaperoning his nephew's 13th birthday party.    "That was not me that night," Ligue told the Daily Southtown. later. "I was going through so much stress. ... I see on the videotape (that) I was out of my mind. I had to let anger out and it came out that way."  Sure.  The real him is just a loser druggie, not a violent lunatic.  I never quite understood why White Sox fans got such a bad rap over this case.  The criminal element in our society will almost always find a way to commit a crime if he really wants to.  This was not a reflection on Sox fans or basball fans.  This was a criminal committing an act of violence.  Where the system failed was in the sentencing.  As I said, criminals will find a way to commit their activities -- it's up to the legal system to punish the criminals for their actions and deter others from doing the same thing.  After Ligue another fan did the same thing to an umpire at Comiskey (fine, U.S. Cellular Field) last year.  Determent failed.  Ligue now has found himself on the wrong side of the law yet again.  Punishment failed.  There is good news -- the man who attacked the umpire was sentenced to jail time.  I believe he got three months.  We'll see if he decides to violate his probation.

        Grey Tuesday   So, if you haven't heard...  DJ Danger Mouse (a guy who reportedly has done gigs wearing a large mouse costume) has mixed a cut-up of Jay-Z's  urlLink Black Album  and the Beatles'  urlLink White Album  to create...   urlLink The Grey Album .  On a purely critical level, the Grey Album is an interesting reenvisioning of Jay-Z's album but shouldn't be considered a tribute to the Beatles.  While the mixes are smart, they are frequently sloppy with the White Album samples.  As a an album, it pales to a great number of official releases and really doesn't deserve some of the frothing accolades it is receiving.  But.  It's free.  And.  It's become the centerpiece of a copyright litigation protest called  urlLink Grey Tuesday , which is occuring right now as I type this.  EMI has threatened lawsuits on sites distributing the free musical experiment, and so these sites and many others (maybe on principle, maybe caught up in the excitement) are distributing the album anyway on this day.  However, as neat as it is, I don't think the Grey Album is strong enough a piece of art to become a rallying banner for actual change.  And, as I've said before on other issues, the problem is that the protest groups are stirring the muck, but they're not guiding the solution.  Grass-roots groups like  urlLink Downhill Battle  do an excellent job of piquing public interest, but they end up losing the long term debate by not engaging law-makers and officials with sensible solutions or interpretations.  But.  Hats off to Downhill Battle (and all other Grey Tuesday participants)for standing up to the internet-infamous Cease and Desist letters.  Even if there could be better long-term strategies, their short-term efforts are a noble attempt to seize back the power on the internet from corporate powers that are claiming it as their own.

        Technologically Proficient   Got to spend a good chunk of today working on the site as you  urlLink may  or  urlLink may not  notice.  As those links show, the graphic menu system on the main page is starting to take form and promises endless fun for everyone involved.  Also, there is now a working archive section to the blog.  So, if you missed my post in December about Outkast's "Hey Ya" and are now wondering what I would have to say about it... well, you can try and find it.  Good luck, chump.  I've updated the link bar once again taking the out-of-season Carnivale link off and switching Tuesday Morning Quarterback to Gregg Easterbrook's non-football column/blog on the New Republic.  Good stuff, highly recommended for frequent reading.  I'm learning more and more about Blogger script and honestly, enjoy the power and customizability of it.  I've been thinking about switching to a MySQL based server blog script, but I think this gets us a little more exposure and certainly does the job in a simple fashion.  Finally, comments are now available and I encourage you to use them.  Follow up on a post with your own witty remarks, ask the author important questions, just waste everyone's time with random statements... the power is yours!

        New Merchandise from Oak Street Park   Over the summer I decided to try and design some Abercrombie-esque t-shirts publicizing fake locations or events.  The t-shirts would be ridiculous but (like their A&F brethren) would have just enough realism that people might have to give them a second glance.  The only idea that really came to fruition was the Oak Street Park Hippie Burn...  An annual event where, presumably, hippies are burned to the great entertainment of spectators.  I think this event may occur with the hippies being willing participants as it cleans them of pachouli stink and pachouli dirt like a prairie fire rejuvinated the plains of the New World.  Of course, no hippies are forcibly ignited. They do, however, run like antelopes out of control once ablaze.  Oak Street Park Hippie Burn T-Shirts are now avaliable for a limited time at the  urlLink RF Store .  The Hippie Burn logo is vibrantly colored and captures the true essence of this fictional event.  Future incarnations of the shirt will be one-color printings, so this is a good chance for hippies  and  not-hippies to get their hands on this celebratory memorabilia.

        Fall of the House of Mouse   Saw Michael Eisner on Larry King Live the other day.  Ouch.  As well as he did trying to hide his worry about the upcoming board meeting (which might result in his ousting) with descriptions of attractions as "awesome", it was painfully obvious the kind of stress he is under internally.  The guy obviously loves what he does, but his tragic flaw may be that he believes too strongly in the power of the brand.  With attacks from all sides, it is becoming increasingly apparent that Disney isn't a media superpower; it can't expect creative talent (like the folks at Pixar) to come groveling to its feet anymore.  Disney needs to work to regain its mythic status and its going to require an about-face turn around.  Because of his love for his place and the company itself, Eisner, if he continues to be obsessed with brand power, will ride the company into the ground.

        Victims of Freshness   The words "more fresher" were uttered many times to me today.  Some answers regarding the current Chipotle crisis based on my conversation with the manager of my workplace Chipotle.  The recipes haven't changed, I was told; apparently, though, the stores will be making the salsas from fresh ingredients on site.  This means your salsa will be fresher.  It's funny then, that your salsa tastes more like  not  fresh salsa.  Still, it may be necessary to plead the Cheese and Macaroni defense.  It's true that fresh ingredients often do equal better food, but occasionally they don't.  Macaroni and Cheese is horrid trash if made with real cheese, but dehydrated cheese is enough to make kids worship the stuff.  FREE GREEN CHILI!

        If you see Beatles albums go on sale for incredible prices, DON'T buy them!!! It's all a ruse.   Picked up the reissue of Bob Dylan's  Blonde on Blonde  and continue to be floored by SACD hybrid reissues (hybrid discs can be played on either SACD or CD players).  The SACD format allows audio to be stored in distinct channels corresponding to a 5.1 speaker set up, so sound engineers are able to emulate the actual space which musicians recorded in.  From the  urlLink Crutchfield Advisor's  interview with Dylan reissues producer  urlLink Steve Borkowitz :   The panning presents Bruce Langhorne (guitar) on the left and the bass on the right, with Bob in the middle — exactly like the stereo. But now, you have the actually palpable sound of the musicians playing in a room — in a real space. It’s three-dimensional, just like it was when he recorded it. The only thing you hear at the back is the stuff that you would naturally hear behind you in the room.    For those without a 5.1 SACD system (I'm still not quite to that point yet either), it's important to note that the work put into the SACD tracks is so intensive that it comes across remarkably even on a simpler system.  Extensive work is done working with original masters in an effort to pull out all the detail and sound they contain.  You can hear instruments as individual units of a song, giving the music a much more real feel.  The Rolling Stones were the first to receive an extensive hybrid reissue discography and now we have Dylan.  I've stopped buying Beatles albums  hoping  that they'll get similar treatment but there doesn't seem to be anything definite on the horizon.

        If I were to make you a tape right now...   ... it would probably have these songs.   Modest Mouse   urlLink Float On       I picked up this song after opening a lucky bottle of Pepsi yesterday and I have listened to it about 15 times since then.  The Mousers continue to emulate the sound of the Talking Heads and now are picking up a little of their sunny disposition as well.  Also, new drummer Benjamin Weikel looks funny when he plays.     David Byrne   You and Eye      Speaking of the Talking Heads, I revisited this used bin pick up earlier this week and found out it wasn't as bad as I remembered.  Sure, it can't touch 90% of Talking Heads songs, Byrne's warm burbling guitars and conspicuous rhythm section work together to make a pretty charming song.   Funky Four plus 1  That's the Joint      Best known for being sampled by the Beastie Boys, this nearly eight minute jam shows just how amazing hip hop was before Yo! MTV Raps made it commercially viable.  Featuring four funky DJs plus female DJ, this track has everything you could possibly want.   OutKast  Happy Valentines Day      This song came into the playlist last Saturday and refused to leave.  Hey, when arrows do not penetrate, Cupid reaches gets his pistol.

        Money For Nothing   If I ever get rich and famous (of course I mean even richer and even more famous than I am now) and I need to negociate a contract, I'm hiring one man and one man only: Scott Boras.  At least three times in the past three years, Boras has gotten his clients more money than they should have been able to get.  Boras, somehow, convinces teams to bid against themselves in the persuit of his free agents.  Yesterday,  urlLink Boras' client Greg Maddux signed a 3-year, $24 million contract with the Chicago Cubs.     This despite the fact no other team offered Maddux a contract.  The Cubs originally offered 2 years and $10 million.  Boras flirted with the San Francisco Giants.  The Cubs upped the offer to 2 years and $14 million.  Boras was in New York to announce the Alex Rodrigues trade (more on "A-Rod" in a bit).  Rumors flew that Maddux would sign with the Yankees.  And guess what?  The Cubs increased their offer to the final numbers.  So, without anyone else bidding for Greg Maddux's services, Scott Boras got $14 million more out of the Cubs.  Brilliant.  As I said, this isn't the first time.  When Alex Rodriguez signed with the Rangers, no other team in baseball bid more than about $16 million per season.  Boras got the Rangers to give A-Rod almost $23 million per season.  This offseason, Ivan Rodriguez signed with the Tigers after once again Boras got the team to raise their offer even though nobody else offered him a contract for more than two seasons.  The result?  Four years, $40 million.  Ka-ching.  Years from now when the big radio stations come after me, begging me to work for them I'll direct them to my agent -- the frozen head of Scott Boras.

        Which is the Better Pun: Dog Days or Dog Daze?    urlLink The Guardian's  L.A. dispatch reporter, Dan Glaister has brought up the claim that America is an  urlLink awards-obsessed culture, especially when it comes to canines .  I'd expect this from Canadian parliament, but our friends in England's press?  Tsk tsk.  I think the big problem with the column itself is that Glaister says that the big story in the US was not a.) primaries b.) janet jackson's nipple c.) bush's tv interview, but was a d.) dog show.  He then mentions that he found out about Westminster in a news service e-mail where it was the  third  story listed.  Out of the four options, I'd hope that the dog show would be number 3.  But Glaister also points out that nearly 4.6 million people watched the show last year... Astonishing for a dog show or for the UK, possibly, but for prime-time US television...  it's a wet newspaper.  Also amazing to Glaister is that there are 58 million dog owners in the US.  But the key is that there are 293 million people in the United States.  There are 60 million people in the UK.  If you multiply all of Glaister's US figures by five, you can see why he has deemed dogs an abnormal craze...  But as it is, it's nothing special.  What's obvious, though, is that there may be a small cultural rift between the US and the UK when it comes to awards and canines and awards for canines.  We're not batty because of it, as Glaister might suggest; we're just different (I feel like I'm in a third world country defending myself against  US  reporters and tourists).  It's an issue of size and population.  We have space to keep large pets, so a sixth of the population does.  As far as awards go... we have a large population of creative work and a somewhat similar coast-to-coast culture, so awards help our culture to pinpoint and document what the greater works are over time.  And we enjoy giving awards for much the same reason; it helps to distinguish our favorite pieces.  Personal rankings work similarly (Nick Hornby's cast of characters in  High Fidelity  were certainly willing participants).  The system is, of course, filled with flaws, but anyone will tell you that; there aren't many highly regarded awards whose awarding is highly regarded.  I know a few people who are obsessed with awards, and the nominees can often get very worked up about them, but most people are only casually interested in them if at all.  But look at me... preaching to the choir.  Just remember folks, Canadia and Dan Glaister are in cahoots (sp?).

        Two Things Everyone Should Know   Give me a couple days to confirm the universality of this, but it appears  urlLink Chipotle  has changed its salsa recipes.  I grew suspicious on Monday when my meal was provided "on the house" after i asked for chips and salsa (maybe i should explain that I have a handful of "usual" items which half the employees have memorized... ).  Why am I being offered free food from people who know I will be back every other day until I change jobs or they change their salsa recipes?  A-HA!  Sure enough...  The sacred has been defiled.  Green Chili (aka crack-cocaine aka medium-hot) has been turned into a horrid parody of itself, a tomato-y edge gives it the flavor of a watered-down generic jar salsa.  Chili-Corn (aka medium aka THE CORN) supposedly has a stronger onion flavor.  Mild (aka tomatoes aka mild) is indistinguishable to me so far but may have a little less cilantro.  Red Chili  (aka chiles de arbol aka ---> HOT >  Give out a holler if you're hearing me on this, but there was the Word of God and then there was Green Chili salsa from Chipotle.  The divine spoke through us through these things and now we're stuck with the NIV of both.  Yeah, it's all there...  but where's the poetry?  Do you feel it?  Crisp, clean salsa taste found nowhere else...  Gone.

        "Nothing Else Behaves Like Me"   From Thomas Oliphant of the Boston Globe (which has been used as a primary source in recent media quagmire):   "However, the impression fostered more in the press than in politics that the inevitable existence of questions and gaps permits  urlLink inferences about the answers  and about what might be in the gaps is... pernicious."

        Good News for People Who Love Carson   After rocking out with  urlLink Modest Mouse  on Wednesday,  urlLink Carson Daily  continues his string of surprisingly good musical guests with  urlLink Death Cab For Cutie  tonight.  Past musical guests have also included  urlLink Sonic Youth  and  urlLink Candy Butchers  and many others whose homepage addresses I am too tired to type in right now.  The point is that the one time terrible Last Call has nearly become almost watchable by catering to the snotty rock hipster set - something MTV, MTV2, and just about every other music venue on TV has given up on.  Not to make a tired argument, but putting interesting music (even if its not popular) on TV can actually draw a sizeable audience.   And they'll even put up with Carson Daily.

        Let's Get Political   If just for a second.  Techno popster Moby (who created the very stellar album  Play  and many par-for-the-course electronic records)  urlLink suggests lying on political-oriented message boards  to incite dissent in  Bush's  presidential campaign.  The can says "Disgusting Worms" but Moby is too busy looking for the perfect sample that he never notices what he's opening.  I can only hoping he was joking....  but if this were to catch on, you could basically write-off the relevancy of democracy.  I am not shitting you.  I've seen Moby get tied up in a few political strangles recently, and what he absolutely does not understand is that your own weapons can be use against you.  Basically, this kind of thing would start a war of disinformation in the New Media, and the Old Media would be too busy salivating over the maggots to actually  urlLink fact-check .  Is it true that the ends can justify the means?  Yes.  Absolutely.  But we cannot actively endorse unsavory means to get our dessert.  Just can't.

        Record Round-Up   After spending one of my morning walks to work planning an elaborate independent shop review / database site, I discovered that one has  urlLink already been made .  At least for record stores.  It's a neat resource and I'd like to see it expanded.  The problem is that by focussing on user reviews, the whole thing could turn south in a second.  We've seen it happen on practically every other major database; individual reviews would be less than meaningless if it weren't already a suffix.  So, the major sites generally either favor the Top Reviewer awards to those who consistently write well (or, well, write consistently) or just create a giant database giving average ratings and demographic stats.  Smaller sites don't have the traffic to do the latter effectively, so they must rely on the former but don't have the traffic to effectively run "review the reviewer" scripts.  Even on larger sites, the most interesting subjects and reviews get ignored or thrown into a giant   Maybe the large question is how do you effectively filter democracy?  I haven't yet seen a system work extremely well at sorting out cheese from the deli meat (our own government included).  This, incidentally, has been the subjct of talks between politicians and video game designers in the past week, as the two discovered their problems and solutions are almost identical.  (I will link as soon as I can find it, but the story after being everywhere yesterday is buried today).   A site I thought would filter well was  urlLink Plastic .  Plastic automatically assigns moderator status to frequent, registered readers which allows them to endorse the quality of individual posts.  Two major problems have befallen Plastic.   A.  The left-leaning readership majority mods up liberal bitch-fest sessions, while conservative participants struggle to get "karma" points for even the most well thought out posts... (A well-recognized issue which generally frustrates the community's most active members.)  B.  As posts build up in popular conversations, readers use karma points to decide what to read, so fresh posts--no matter how astute--are ignored.  But.  Plastic is a pretty fair system and is one of the best, if not the best, mass public message boards on the internet.    I'm realizing I'm getting way too long with this post, so I'm going to stop for now and continue on specifically how an early era Plastic model could help sites like RSR from drowning in their own democracy.

        Cheese Blog   I think of a lot of good ideas for blog entries on my walks to and from work, but with all the crazy stuff that happens on those walks.... I generally forget them.  I did remember this item though.  Someday if I ever get steenking rich and I feel like being mean, I'm going to go into specialty stores and ask for a clerk's advice on purchasing...  say, a new ottoman or digi-cam.  In order for this to work, I will also need them to suggest some really expensive luxury item.  Then.  I will mock it.  But the trick is, I will demand to buy it  because  it is so hideously awful.  "I never want to forget how horrible a thing this is," I might say as I chortle up the twenty dollar bills that will line my stomach.  Pause.  Unpause.  This would completely crush the self esteem of the sales clerk because of their role in the exchange.  If I call something "ugly" and leave, I've created a barrier of conflict.  The clerk will think I'm a jerk and be on with his/her life.  But if I patronize the clerk while insulting him, I force him to in some way agree with my statements in order to make the sale.  In sales, we often become convinced by our own sales; at my store, we generally distrust Canon cameras because Canon pays us the least amount of money for selling their goods.  Clerks often buy the things they sell because they've convinced themselves that it's something they need.  It's something that can be turned back on them/us.  And with it you can demolish their/our aesthetic taste.

        Segway into Disney   I'm categorically against the Segway scooter, that crazy gyroscopic upright personal transport, as a means of transportation, especially to be used around pedestrians.  In the words of Gregg Easterbrook, getting hit by one of those things would be like getting tackled by an NFL linebacker at full speed.  I don't trust people's focus on navigating it enough to feel at all comfortable with them zipping around me.  Maybe I should...  But I know the way people are in crowded and/or interesting places, and motor vehicles aren't good to add into the mix.  Regardless.  Disney World employees use them; I saw them a lot around Epcot when I went last spring, and I'm pretty sure I saw one or two at the other parks.  Disney, I also seem to recall, was one of the major buyers of the Segways when they were first introduced.  I am not certain if  urlLink Disney's ban on patron usage of the scooters  instead of wheelchairs is straight out hypocrisy.  But I do know that this really doesn't say much about Disney's confidence in the product.  Another sign of the tremendous flop the Segway was/is.  I remember that in the expo portion of Epcot, a staff member was showing it off... and you could tell everyone gathered around was waiting for a chance to try it.  No such luck.  Why?  Because.  They're friggin' dangerous around groups of pedestrians.  So, in Disney's defense, if someone came up to the front gate in a golf cart (which staff do use inside the park) I probably wouldn't let them in either.  Those complaining about their rights to the Segways use could just as well be saying, "Not letting me drive around Disney World in my pick-up truck makes me feel more crippled".

        Announcements   Work is continuing on RF Proper; the Dogmi gallery is now working and you will see that American Ninja Underground is also on the front page of the site.  (I will always post here when there is new content.)  There is a small problem with the Dogmi gallery system that I am looking into fixing.  If you are experiencing any other difficulties with the site -- things not laid out properly, etc -- contact me via e-mail ( mike at robotsfighting.com ) with what browser you are using and exactly what the problem is (a screenshot is helpful if you have the time / capability).  In other news, former Kindler Ben Johnson is at EA doing some work on the Ultima X morpg project Odyssey.  Also, if you buy the new Dead or Alive game in Japan, you will get  urlLink this .  O Dead or Alive... solid games turned legendary by a little jiggling and a lot of cheesecake.

        Doing My Part   The following is a message to anyone who can't resist opening up an e-mail attachment because it might be something important...  It's not.  From CNN :  MyDoom.A, also known as Novarg or Shimgapi, emerged nearly a week ago in the form of a spam e-mail message that contained a well-disguised virus attachment.   NOOOOOO!  It's not well-disguised!  It's a freaking e-mail attachment!  You can't disguise an e-mail attachment!!!  That's like saying that the bomb outside your front door was cleverly disguised as a bomb.  Well, maybe, even though it looks like a bomb it's actually a package from a long lost lover.  Let's open it up and screw the entire world up the polar ice cap.  Also from CNN:  Yes, so basically it disguises itself so there's no clear thing to look for.    Wait, wait...  Even MyDoom's arrival as a no-body-text e-mail attachment (basically, saying to us plainly "I am a f**king virus"), is not a clear enough sign to tell there's a virus?  TRULY... TRULY THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO!  QUICKLY!  TO THE PANIC ROOM!  (Why do these explanations get buttered up in the news media?)  Honestly, I can be a little forgiving to people who are just coming to the internet and don't understand that it's not Disneyland...  they don't understand that they cohabitate this space with other people who are more savvy and more exploitave than them.  They need to learn this quickly, though.  Perhaps a tour of the world, where they can see metropolises like CNN or AOL.com but also be driven by the vast frontiers of porn and piracy.  Whatever the case, they're naive and the community needs to do its best to make them less so.  My problem is people who consistently get burned by viruses and scams.  It's been explained to them, they've seen the results... but still... they just can't not click the freakin' e-mail attachment.  They look at it and maybe they think for a second, "Hey...  This is a little suspicious, maybe I should just delete it."  But fantasies of Disney erotica and de-light-ful forwards override reason, and suddenly their computer is effectively disabled and Microsoft has lost $250 million.  I hate these people, and I wish we had a way to make them go watch TV and leave the internet alone.  Seriously, don't be that guy.  And if you know that guy, BASH HIS BRAINS IN WITH THE CLOSEST SOLID OBJECT!  DO IT NOW!

        Beyonce's a Survivor   The girl's a class act, but a guy who isn't is Richard Hatch.  Honestly, I know why they picked who they did from the Borneo (I) cast, but the Sue and Jenna thing was over by the time the first season reunion special occurred.  There's a good possibility that the oppurtunity for tension may never even arise (and there's no guarantee it will even then).  I guess they selected the four fiercest players from season 1, but I would have rather seen Gervase or Colleen come back for a showing.  You don't have to be in constant competition to win Survivor (Tina from Australia is good enough evidence of this), so why not bring back a few more interesting/fun characters?  Anyway, the downfall of many would-be contenders is that they get to playing "the game" too early.  In its early stages, Survivor  is  about surviving; your group needs to stay as united as is possible in order to lay the groundwork for a strong post-merger showing.  If you make too many enemies too early, if you let your tribe get picked off in immunity challenges, you're not going to last.  You have no immunity protection from your own tribe nor can you make actual strategic or trust alliances based on immunity.  In these first stages it is about tribal unity, not individual strength.  Richard, having been gone for half a dozen seasons, is way too anxious to play.  He is playing as if he were only 5 people away from getting another million dollars already, pretending to hold all the secrets and promising to muckrake.  He'll have to be on his toes if his actions cause his group to shatter.  Even if he's around just to have fun screwing people over, he's not going to be doing it for long.  Pride is his hubris, and he appears to be blinded by it right now.  I'm rooting for any member of the Africa cast, although I wouldn't mind if Colby got his dues for losing so graciously to Tina in the Outback.

        Apologies   I deeply apologize to everyone for the near incoherency of the previous post.  I was writing it on the brink of sleep, much like I used to write all my columns in college...  which reminds me that is time to apologize for the incoherency of those pieces.  Sometimes, just because words can be fit together, does not mean they should be.  I also apologize to everyone who I have to send e-mails to... This time my excuse is still lame, but it is better than most times as my laptop has inexplicably lost function of its G, H, Backspace, and ' keys.  I generally prefer writing on my laptop, and it is psychologically difficult for me to use my tower for that sort of thing these days.  We (and by we, I mean I, but maybe you will empathize) have been spoiled by an abundance of technology.  I will get my act together very soon, but I have two other things distracting me right now.  1.  I received a pass for the Chicago preview screening of the  urlLink movie version  of  urlLink Hellboy the comic .  I like Hellboy a lot.  To me, it's a readable superhero comic, one that works well in a short story format along with the drawn-out serial plotting.  The characters are clear-cut and consistent.  The art is superb; bold, dark and brooding with elaborate simplicity.  And it's got everything... Demons, Nazis, mythological monstrosities, fishmen, frogmen, wolfmen, Lobster Johnson...   I'm excited to see how well it will transfer onto celluloid.  I'll throw my thoughts up here.  2.  Also for free, I signed on for the  urlLink Lineage 2  open beta.  It's my first experience with a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game since  urlLink Gemstone 3  and Federation (which I cannot find even a tangential link to) were centerpieces of AOL's online gaming aspect.  Both were text-based if it helps you put things in perspective.  Unfortunately, Lineage 2 has been  packed  and the servers seem unpredictable as to their ability to keep people on, so I haven't been able to get a decent session going.  I have, however, killed my fair share of wolves on the open plains of the game's starting towns.  It's a funny sight to walk over a hill and see hordes of individual players chasing wolves around and slaughtering them.  I don't understand why MMORPGs insist on having players mass execute in order to get to a point where they can actually begin playing.  Give players a quick tutorial era where they can get a chunk of abilities and develop their own style within a few fights.  After about ten kills, I should be choosing if I want to be on my way or if I want to screw around with brutality.  No other genre could get away with the tedium that's acceptable in MMORPGs.  But, as I said, I haven't really gotten to play for more than a few hours, so my criticism may not be entirely fair.  Anyhow.  I'm going to try and ride my bike for a bit before the movie, so I'll be taking off now.

        Dawn with the Sickness   Saw  Dawn of the Dead  (the remake) last night, and I think I agree with the widespread critical analysis of it as the original without the underlying social commentary.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a crazy zombie action movie, and it's definitely fun.  What  Dawn of the Dead  (2004) does well is tell a lot of mini zombie-stories through the basic structure of survival in a mall.  As if you were shopping it, the movie has a lot to choose from...  And you're not going to buy everything.  There are scenes and plot twists in  Dawn of the Dead  (neuvo) that are hopelessly ridiculous and would likely spoil the movie if you were allowed to ponder them as in the film's inspiration.  But walk away with one shopping bag of savvy finds, and you'll be delighted.  One of my favorite moments was the addition of "Andy" a gun shop owner alone on his rooftop across the parking lot from the mall that the central characters dwell in, whose communication with Ving Rhames' removed cop is the centerpiece of a montage scored with a lounge cover of Rage Against the Machine's "Down With the Sickness".  Other added characters don't work out as well; the head mall security guard, for instance, undergoes a major attitude shift almost instananeously.  Some moments work (the communication breakdown during the rescue of a truck full of "refugees"), others don't (the escape from the mall is generally silly).  But everything gels well.  Zombie fiction, however, is in a state of crisis with the continuing presence of fast zombies (28 Days Later) which goes against traditional zombie lore.  Directors seem to feel that fast zombies will help make zombies more terrifying, and they're right.  Fast zombies are much more frightening than true, slow zombies.  But.  They are made so overpowering that human survival becomes completely implausible.  Directors create a situation that  requires  a deus ex machina in order to drive the story.  This breaks any added suspense having a fast zombie creates.  We need slow zombies back.  Now, more than ever.

Of Montreal -  urlLink Disconnect the Dots  New Wave plus Vocal Pop plus Kevin Barnes Style Psychedelia - sounds like a train wreck but works as well or better than anything to come out of the Athens twee scene in years.  From the forthcoming  Satanic Panic in the Attic   TV on the Radio -  urlLink Dreams  Unbelivably heavy and gloriously uplifting at the same time, TV on the Radio is the flying buttress of the indie rock world.  From  Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes   Out Hud -  urlLink  Dad,There's A Little Phrase Called Too Much Information  How could you possibly dance to this?  From last year's  S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.   The Decemberists -  urlLink Shiny  This straight forward country/folk single from The Decemberists proves that they can write good songs that don't involve pirates.  From  The Tain.   Xiu Xiu -  urlLink Clowne Towne  Far closer to art than entertainment, Xiu Xiu are destined to dominate the mix tapes of stuck up collectors for years to come.  From  Fabulous Muscles   Kanye West -  urlLink Through the Wire  At first, rapping through a broken jaw seems like an obnoxious gimmick, but West's nimble lyrics and solid flow turn it into a inventive disruption of an increasingly predictable genre.  From  The College Dropout.

        Errol Morris' Fog of War   In the same way that people apply Sun Tzu's  Art of War  to  urlLink practical use , I feel like the eleven lessons that make up the structure of   urlLink Fog of War   have similar application but for a culture where combat is generally avoided.  In the film, McNamara looks back on his role in major points of 20th Century conflict and grapples with his successes (the Cuban Missile Crisis) and his failures (Vietnam, the fire-bombing of Japan) and attempts to explain what is important to learn from those events in hindsight.  As he meets with former foreign opponents to openly discuss history, he discovers that they had very different national interests than the Cabinets McNamara was part of had assumed.  Instead of Sun Tzu's "Burn the bridges", Morris and McNamara present "Empathize with your enemy", referring to how nuclear war was avoided in the Cuban Missile Crisis and ultimately the United States' failrue to control the situation in Vietnam.  While McNamara is not saying that conflict is always avoidable, his thesis in the film is that the time we spend in war can be minimized with practical values, with an understanding of the flaws of human nature, the flaws of reason.   Fog of War  is masterfully shot, edited and scored and is an incredible insight into conflict in the 20th Century.  Definitely a documentary deserving of its Academy Award.

        Live Action Anime   What would happen if you made a live action Anime?   urlLink Casshern  is what.  Can you call it Anime?  It sure looks like Anime...  But the actors aren't animated.  (Are the  Mary Poppins  subset of films considered cartoons?)  You might argue  The Matrix  is already an example of this.  But I'd respond that what  Matrix  does is take a lot of Anime style and paste it onto an American action movie.  It's kind of like the Chipotle of movies.  Yeah, it's a burrito, but too many things have been tweaked to make it a  real  burrito.

        RIAA Realizes... There is a Better Way   From the  urlLink Chi Trib  today.  Apparently, the new boom in SACD / DVD-Audio formats (Elton John's  Goodbye Yellow Brick Road  has been re-released as a hybrid disc, by the way) is a way to discourage piracy by presenting better audio quality and more features in a physical format.  Brilliant.  This is good news all around.  Hybrid discs are still rippable to the mp3 format, still unlimitedly burnable to new CDs, but the original discs have quality that is uncapturable.  Sharers rejoice because they can have the freedom to share, to test drive music and to become more informed on what's out there without having their minds flogged by radio.  Record companies hold onto sales even if people have downloaded an album.  Audiophiles and music lovers reap the benefits of having a high quality audio format being pushed in the mainstream (and will have to replace their old Elton John CD's).  And if you're Sony right now...  Keep crying about album sales and let no one realize the kind of money you've been minting with the sales of mp3-playing devices and now SACD-compatible players.  You are so money and you know it.

        Proof That You Don't Have to Be Young and Black...   ...all you need is  urlLink no sense of ethical responsibility .  Here's the cut-and-dry "we're gonna sink this bastard" version of Jack Kelley's ouster for plagiarism and fabrication from  urlLink USA Today .  Here's my you-heard-it-here-first moment of the century, discovered by my tireless research (Google)...  Jack Kelley is (was?)  urlLink faculty  at the  urlLink World Journalism Institute .  The reason I'm familiar with WJI is because flyers for it are frequently passed on to me by my pastor.  That's right, WJI is a journalism school focused on Christian ethics.  From their mission statement (linked above):   There is one primary reason why the World Journalism Institute should be committed to the education of young journalists: it comes directly from the need to be faithful to the Christian example of accurately reporting (e.g., being reliable eyewitnesses) the work of God in today's world.    We at WJI believe it is now time to implement a new phase of this statement in order to help turn out journalists capable of presuppositional reporting.   O I love the smell of irony in the morning.

        I'm Just Like All These Other Collector Losers, I   Thought I'd diversify the listing of things a little bit by adding some of the better comics I've been reading.   urlLink  Hell   - (preview available)  Gorgeously drawn and colored.  Hell of the title is actually an island of genetic experimentation (Eden) gone horribly awry.  The coloring is lush; there is probably no better word for how well its details and pallettes work.  And the drawing... Done in a graffiti-ish style, with sharp, jagged emphasis along curving and twisting forms, captures action and motion as well as (if not better than) anything I've seen.  I'm only through issue 1 (there are four on stands), but if the story holds up, Hell could assert itself as one of the best action comics in production.   urlLink  B.P.R.D.   - ( urlLink preview ) With the Hellboy movie coming out, it seems providential that I discover B.P.R.D., a Hellboy spin-off as sure as they come.  This comic makes me very curious about the film.  Yeah, the first issue ends with a lot of screaming and shooting and punching and monster noises.  But you gotta have some of that when you've compiled a task force of tortured superfreaks.  There's an air of "League of Extraordinairy Gentlemen", but I get the feeling that much more has been invested into the story than with that book.  We will see when the second issue comes out in April.   urlLink  The Pogostick   - Our hero is a mixture of Milton from Office Space and Jimmy Corrigan of Smartest Kid on Earth fame.  As such, Pogostick is a dark comedy of office interrelation hijinx and tragedy.  Al Columbia is an amazing comics artist, yet (like many underground comix) his work is difficult to come by when it's out of its run.  It's good to be reading it during the cycle.  Some quick notes as well...   urlLink  Dead@17   is essentially Buffy the Zombie Slayer and a little disappointing because of it...  urlLink  The Clockmaker   folds out to tabloid size and wins some art points because of it, but the story itself is plodding (I'm on issue 3) especially for a short-run comic...  the new  Optic Nerve  is on par for Adrian Tomine; I'd reccommend the previous issue (#8) if you'd like to read an exemplary story of his.

        Ripped from the headlines...   Kudos to  urlLink Eric Zorn's amazing blog  for this one.  If you've ever seen even one episode of "Law and Order" or "Law and Order: SVU" or "Law and Order: Criminal Intent" or "Law and Order: CSI", you must check out the  urlLink Random Law and Order Plot Generator .  My favorite so far:   A headless corpse is discovered in a park by out-of-towners. Lenny and Curtis initially pin the crime on the victim's lover, but after insurance fraud is revealed, they arrest a down-on-his-luck executive. McCoy and Kincaid prosecute, but McCoy must skirt the law to win. The old DA takes a drink and says "Advice is like castor oil, easy to give but dreadful to take." Tony Danza guest stars.    These are the actual TV Guide recaps of tonight's episodes on NBC:   After a sweatshop owner is beaten to death, suspicion falls on the husband of a worker he impregnated.     The discovery of a woman's body in the Hudson River leads to an investigation that uncovers a scandal involving attorneys and a judge.    I wonder if McCoy will get his man.

        Spanish Bombs   It's impossible to tell just what the swing in the Spanish vote was caused by. Any of the reasons I've heard (from the polls being wrong, to the Iraq war, to the heavy-handed accusations at ETA) have validity on a micro level with individual voters. It's silly to think that the entire swing was motivated by one particular response.  Democracy is wild and diverse...  The issue here, in my mind, is that what happened went  urlLink exactly as predicted .  From a piece on Iraqi jihad that the Guardian cites being published in December:   "If [Spain's] troops remain in Iraq after the attacks, a Socialist victory is practically guaranteed and withdrawal of the troops will feature in its election manifesto."   This is what makes the election results frightening however fair and justified they may be.  There is a plan in action that we (again) did not foresee.

        The [Start] and Fall of Matte   Noticed today that alt.culture magazine Matte has given up its domain and is no longer even in Google.  A sad sight (site) because the folks at Matte were putting out one of the best magazines on the shelves.  What did Matte do well?  Well, for one, its design balanced text with art in interesting ways (like a black and white Print almost).   urlLink Here's a sample .  Tied to that, it was terrificly readable.  The writing was handled maturely without being too heavy-headed, and the design was enough to draw you into an article you might otherwise skip over.  Plus, there were just a  lot  of in depth articles.  Reading 30% of the magazine was like reading everything in two issues of Rolling Stone.  Even aside from these basic foundation points, Matte had a lot going for it.  A large advertising base with pricey rates (for a small press publication) was in place from the very first issue.  They had a publisher belaying, at least, part of the up-front cost.  And distributors.  A large staff and what seemed to be a good support structure...  So what went wrong?  Well, I have guesses...  The change in printing between issue 2 and 3, moving from a thick, unfinished heavy stock like The Believer to a more traditional paper quality, seems to hint at the economic plan of the magazine falling apart.  I'd gander that the magazine wasn't able to pull in subcribers with its $20 for 4 issues plan.  I also imagine its abstract covers weren't able to attract the eye of buyers on a newstand end.  The third side of effective distribution for a print pub these days is the web, but Matte's website was static and fairly minimalist.  The readership for Matte  should  have been much larger, but its most basic draws for building that readership were fairly impotent.  In my dreams, I imagine co-editor Anne Elizabeth Moore's seeping-through-the-pages pretension (which may or may not be fair to her outside Matte) to have turned enough people off to lead to the withering of Matte.  But, I'll place my bet in reality on the business model collapsing because of the mag consistently turning its back on effective marketing techniques.  I don't know who is at fault for that.  Still, Matte's collapse has an important lesson in it for the small press...  Even if everything goes right, it can still be blown.

        SHOCKED   Jayson Blair seemed shocked and unprepared to deal with hardball questions on MSNBC's Hardball earlier today.  Hm.  Nobody ever said the guy was a genius.  O wait!  They did!  To make matters even zanier....  The guy who once pretended to be a journalist is now pretending to be a  urlLink superhero .  Not enough pain for you?  In his book, Blair blames his problem on "drug and alcohol addiction, undiagnosed manic-depressive disorder and the pressure of being a young, black reporter at a large, competitive newspaper."  On Hardball, he said he was at home sick when he was first lured into fabricating stories.  If he would mention the  urlLink depravity of man  he'd have a straight flush.  Blair ducked and weaved through the interview attributing all he could on the "old" Jayson Blair, even looking like he had never thought about how he had shown a total lack of respect for the NYT readership.  The moment of the Hardball interview when he shook Chris Matthews hand and said with a smile, "Thanks for having me here," made me physically nauseous.  If the New York Times has done one thing right, ever, it's currently refusing to acknowledge that Blair exists as a media figure.   Update!    urlLink Bookslut  caught a tidbit on Slate with another Blair excuse "He was do-gooding. He had visited a man in prison, taught at an inner-city school, and visited his girlfriend's childhood weekend home in Morris, N.Y. Also, he was tired."

        I'll Be Your Friend If You Give Me a Dollar a Day   Excited to be joining the Chicago Blogs web ring.  You'll see the link added to the left in the links column... Click on the arrows in either direction to move through the blogs in the ring or hit  urlLink "chicago blogs"  to go to the central site.  Initially, the other bloggers will probably view us as a pack of tools without the concise, poetic wit of their own pubs.  But, over time, they will come to realize that our prose is so poetic, our subtlety so concise, our wittiness so witty that they were fools to ever think elsewise.  They will shower us with comments like rose petals from the city walls, paving roads where we are thinking about walking (but will probably change our minds), reinforcing corroded infrastructure, asking for our autographs and hollering "Yo da man!" while we try and sink a putt for birdie on the 7th hole.  And then we will quit.  The world will fall into the black void of silence once again... Until they post in their own blogs.  At which point, we'll be nothing more than the  urlLink Suck.com  of the 21st century.

        This is the Washington Post we're talking about, right?   From the Washington Post:  a comprehensive analysis and explanation of their  urlLink fairness and accuracy policies , including a discussion of the use of anonymous sources.  I, like many people, despise anonymous sources.  It's nice to hear someone apologize for having to use them.  But much of the problem comes from protection of people whose information is not ni fact sensitive while skewering up those who are in actual danger.  There isn't a consistency in the standards.  What that means is that the press gets manipulated by its interviews, especially in Washington.

        Just be in Love when You Scream that Song II   Here we go.   Violent Femmes  -  Johnny  : I've been appreciating a bit more how good the Violent Femmes are since seeing  urlLink Guster  cover their self-titled debut on MTV2 last Friday.  My first exposure to the band was during high school, sitting in a car with two other not-theater-type theater friends while they with great anticipation popped in an album.  Like the whole environment of the evening and my relation with those friends, I remember the music being roughly defined, dark and still somehow poppy as hell.  So, I've always had a considerable warm spot for the Femmes, but I don't think I ever delved too deeply with them.  "Johnny" is a track I had never listened to.  It has all the angry variations of emotion that Femmes are known for but in a song that pulls itself back into a simple eulogy every time it starts to break away.   Guided by Voices  -  Echos Myron  : Honestly, I like it just because it's a catchy little lo-fi number; a toying melody against an electric wall of noise.   Elvis  -  (Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame  : I've spoken my love for "In the Ghetto" before for its pure bizarrity.  But before Elvis was overblown (or  urlLink switched places  with an impersonator), he was singing simple numbers that - so much more than his later efforts - delighted and shocked the world.   Josh Rouse  -  Love Vibrations  : I'm saying "Love Vibration" even though I probably listen to "Slaveship" a bit more, because I feel like if you want to get to know  urlLink Josh Rouse , "Love Vibration" is a very good place to start.  Think  urlLink Conor Oberst  if he was obsessed with soul and could feel the human emotion of love.  The album is appropriately titled  1972  , right before the 70s turned sour.  (I think.)   Scott Miller and the Commonwealth  - Any Song off Thus Always to Tyrants. : Alright.  I know I broke the rules, here, but...  If you have any love for rock, if you have any love for country, if you have any more love in you than Conor Oberst, you need to stop by your local music shoppe and nab a copy of  Thus Always to Tyrants .  Steal it if you have to.  Scott Miller is not Radiohead.  He's not obsessed with form and complexity.  What he does is write a song that will hijack your brain and make you believe there is a guitar in your hands and a rock star in your heart.  Perfectly crafted, perfectly delivered, perfectly captivating.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Yum!

        At the Movies   Today in the Sun-Times (Still 35 cents!), Roger Ebert writes  urlLink one of the best movie reviews I've read in a long time .  What movie does he review?  It doesn't matter.  And that's the point.  A movie review should be interesting and hold your attention even if you don't know a thing about the film.  The lead paragraph in this review is superb.

        Air America Radio, The Left AM   So, it appears the much-ado, thankfully-not-named-Indie-Network, politically-left radio network  urlLink Air America  is about to dive into the pool with air-time locked in New York, here in Chicago and a handful of other cities.  I've decided to create a short list of both reasons it could succeed and reasons it could fail; this way, I'll be right regardless of what happens.   Reasons Air America Could Succeed   1.  Al Franken - He's funny.  The guy is good at sifting through rhetoric and has become the classic antithesis of Rush Limbaugh because of it.  Accordingly, he's been able to hold his ground in debate against conservative rhetoricians like Sean Hannity.  A name I've seen for his program is the O'Franken Factor. Cute.  2.  Jeaneane Garofalo - She's funny!  Another talented comedi person and the Hannity killer for the network... Because Sean Hannity is so Rah-Rah-publican and so so unentertaining to listen to if you disagree with him, Garofalo stands an excellent chance of picking up stray listeners (even conservatives) who are tired of that idiotic Hannity theme song.  3.  Political Satire - It's funny!!  Liberal, conservative, it doesn't matter... Satire is unassuming and coy.  Basically, AAR has assembled representatives from every quality poltical satire entity in the past decade.  Franken is from Saturday Night Live, Garofalo was involved with Michael Moore's TV projects, Lizz Winstead is somewhere in the mix and a co-creator of the Daily Show.  Is that gold or is that platinum?  You can decide.  4.  There is a Void - Liberals who are tired of repetitive music stations have escaped to talk radio along with their conservative brethren.  They listen to conservative programming and end up calling in to complain, at which point they are obliterated by well-trained conservative hosts.  Yes, there are liberal talk radio hosts even on otherwise conservative networks, but the conservatives are the ones moving up in ranks (for whatever reason).  Somewhere there  is  a market, and you need only listen to Rush Limbaugh for a few minutes to hear voices from it.   Reasons Air America Could Fail   1.  Al Franken - We'll start with the easy points here...  Franken comments on commentators.  Now that he has his own show, he's going to be unable to listen to and study those commentators (**cough**Rush**cough**) and direct commentary has to be the center of the show.  While we've seen Franken push policy, it's generally been in the wings.  On a side note, how many weeks before trying to call in to Limbaugh's show becomes a regular staple?  2.  Garofalo - Her fame is from generic comedy.   Yes, she's been vocal about political issues, and being vocal is the basic prerequisite for radio.   But is she going to be able to spit out dates, cases and records like her counterparts whose mainstream identity was born from political debate?  Maybe.  If she's not at the start, it's going to take her some time to get into the swing of things...  Is she going to be interested enough in this program to stick with it that long?  As much as she is an asset, she is also a tremendously large question mark.  3.  NPR - In the radio world, NPR is like a badge of courage for the liberal educated and political talk is unbearable schlock.  Is it going to be necessary for AAR to pull liberal listeners from NPR (where they've found refuge from the likes of Limbaugh)?  Is it possible given the social status of NPR?  Not saying NPR  is  liberal, just saying it is something of a haven.  4.  What Good's the Radio? - Franken, for one, admits he is in this deal partly as an effort to get Bush not-elected come November.  But add a lack of radio experience with talk radio's traditional impotence when it comes to presidential elections, and you could get frustration... especially for investors.  Ask yourself.  What good did Limbaugh ever do?  The AAR website itself places the foundation of conservative talk radio in 1988 when a (R) was in the Oval Office, which boomed through 1992... when Bill Clinton (D) won the presidency.  It continued to steadily grow through 1996 when...  Bill Clinton (D) won again.  After the 2000 election results, certain individuals (including candidate Al Gore) began partly blaming talk radio for Bush's win (robbery, of course, was the major complaint).  Thus, the polterzeitgeist was born.  But it's never proved to be anything substantial; it's obsessing over gnats while you're getting stung by bees.  Here's a column on this issue from  urlLink a liberal perspective  in an effort to prove I'm not being ridiculous with this point.  Anyway, I think I've covered my bases.  Back to you.

        Dispatches from the Commonwealth   Been a fan of  urlLink Scott Miller  since he assembled the Commonwealth and released  urlLink  Thus Always To Tyrants   so I was excited to read about a recent whistle-stop tour on the  urlLink Amtrack Crescent .  Jack Neely of Knoxville's MetroPulse stayed along for the ride and crafted  urlLink "This Train Goes On"  a long form piece of rock journalism that blends remnants of the Civil War, public transportation and rock and roll into a portrayal of region-by-region perceptions of Miller on this interesting tour.

        Porn on Beta   A couple weeks ago, I was casting out the question, "Was porn ever made on  urlLink beta ?"  Not because of a particular desire or need for it, but because of the  urlLink popular   urlLink legend  that the porn industry's exclusive support for VHS was a major force in the demise of Betamax.  You most commonly hear the story in conjunction with a defense of  urlLink porn's importance in driving new technology  particularly the internet.  If the accounts are correct, then porn on beta is something of legendary status in the annals of antiquated technology.  One band from Vancouver, at least, has  urlLink acknowledged this  (although, their bio avoids it).  Unfortunately, the answer I fished up wasn't nearly as exciting as the mythos of the question.  One respondent attested to owning a fairly large collection of porn on beta.... which ruins my hope that such an item is a monumental rarity.  He also claims that the fall of beta mostly had to do with aggressive marketing of VHS by JVC, including some ultra-discounted distribution in the professional market.  (This may be where the porn myth arises.)  The claims seem backed up by the  urlLink Urban Legend archive , which outlines the marketing battle and resulting price war.  As much as I hate to abandon this novel story, it appears the facts are forcing me to do so.

        How the Lion Lost Its Pride   There are new comics reviews up at  urlLink Pop Matters  including my review of Paul Hornschemeier's  urlLink  Mother Come Home  .  My goal was to reflect on the central symbol of the comic, hopefully broadening the possibility of its meaning for the reader.  The Pop Matters style is interesting because at a root level it is searching for the same type of criticism that we have been with Robots Fighting, yet its large readership also looks to the site for clear opinions.  It is taking me a few reviews to be able to balance things in a way I feel is appropriate without seeming too constructed or too vague.  I feel like I'm getting there with the  Mother Come Home  review, although my attempt to move beyond the symbolism to actually rate the book is a tad weak.

        These Are the Vistas   Any two things moving with different rhythms will at some point for some time reach a synchronicity.  If you've ever ridden a swing next to another person you've seen the effect in practice, when without effort you swing  with  someone you had been swinging opposite of.  But the synchronous rhythm does not last perpetually and soon your swings are disjointed again.  Enter the joy and the frustration and the joy in frustration of post-bop jazzers  urlLink The Bad Plus .  Their compositions soar over jagged and scattered beats until they rise over a particular peak and reveal some perfect, hidden vista.  But just as you begin to acquiant yourself with the surroundings maybe even settling in, the music's wings are taking you away to some other secret majesty.  That said, their contemporary rock covers have warmed to the populous, giving the listener a thread of familiarity with which to trevail the rocky and glorious heights of The Bad Plus' breed of jazz.  These tracks are like Sound Picassos, breaking their sources apart and reforming them so you can hear every angle at once...  But despite the brilliance of these moments, does The Bad Plus risk becoming a novelty act because of them?  It's a question the band must be aware of and an awareness that can only heighten the danger.  As their repertoire of covers builds, will anyone care to listen to their original compositions?  It's true there are a number of pieces that reach places more beautiful than anything in The Bad Plus' explorations of common locales, but for average listeners the trails to get to those places are foreboding.  "Iron Man" is possibly the cover least coy about its inspiration and as a result the least graceful, yet this is what the audience of last week's show at Martyr's demanded to hear.  I don't think it was because of a particular contempt for the original compositions - the crowd grooved to all of them - but because, given the choice we'd rather discover an antique pocketwatch in the floor boards than to face hunger and cold as we traverse the Andes to find  urlLink the clock the world spins by .

        Volume 2   If  urlLink  Kill Bill vol. 1   had been what  urlLink  Kill Bill vol.2   is, I probably would have been apathetic to the entire series.  For certain, I didn't want talking.  I told Kristi back in the day, "If there is no talking in the entire movie, I will be happy."  And in the end (or middle?), I was impressed with Quentin Tarrantino's ability to embed complex themes into the two hour fight sequence with as little talking as possible  and  to still keep it constantly fresh with an amalgam of international action movie styles.  (Was just thinking, incidentally, about Cottonmouth's board room scene being Tarrantino's way of suggestively defending his creation as a legitimate fight movie.)  That said, at the cliffhanger conclusion of Volume 1 what I wanted for Volume 2 was not non-stop action, I wanted talking.  I didn't have any desire to see the Bride storm through dojos for another 2 hours.  Yeah, some swordplay was going to be necessary, but I understood the world the characters lived in and wanted to, obviously, the plot to reach a full-fledged fruition but also to be given a deeper look into the mythology of the characters.  And it's what we get.  What seems clear to me is that Tarrantino is one of the best character developers in cinema.   Kill Bill  (and arguably the entire filmography) is a handful of interesting characters tossed together in a basic framework.  They invent their own story and Quentin just tweaks the knobs and dials...  "What happens if we have Uma Thurman, Darryl Hannah, and David Carradine all get their training from the same guy?"  "Let's set it so that David and Uma and Michael Madesn have the same one-of-a-kind sword."  Most of the intricacy of the character's relationships to one another stays in the subtext but feels nevertheless more true because of it.  The story is controlled by the characters, and as such allows the actors to dazzle.  So, how Tarrantino approaches some scenes is, in some sense, dependent upon how the actors control their characters.  In other cases, Tarrantino adjusts the controls... camera angles, lighting / color design, exposure, whatever...  and the characters play through.  There's a symbiosis to the whole thing.  A few years ago, I winced at the idea of Tarrantino doing a  Dirty Dozen  style World War II flick; I couldn't see him being able to make the transition from Resevoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction into that...  But, here in  Kill Bill , he  proves  his proficiency at character design and his intent to let that design drive the story.

        iRecycle   If you've got free iTunes songs from Pepsi's big promotion and have no real interest in using them (I'm in the boat, where unless I have a full cd, I have no interest in having an ugly file format on my comp), check out  urlLink Tune Recycler  from the folks at  urlLink Downhill Battle .  Send them your codes and they will use them to repetitively purchase the albums of various independent artists (including  urlLink Pretty Girls Make Graves ).  Pepsi only expects 10-20% of all codes to be redeemed by the April 30 deadline, so this is a way to get the codes that you never intended to use active and make some indie artists a little bit happier.   Creative Use of iTunes #2:   I was on iTunes looking for something to spend my songs on (I ended up donating them via TuneRecycler but may end up buying an album or two in the future from Apple) and discovered that the service has high quality, quickly streaming samples for every song in the database...  What's more is that the clips seem to be smartly produced, picking highlight moments of the songs.  It's exploitable for  anyone who would rather buy a physical copy.   Weird iTunes iTem   I signed on looking for tracks from the Guster-covers-Femmes show and was disappointed at the limited number of songs from the event (five altogether, with one being a Guster original)...  But I did find the Meow Mix of Guster's Keep It Together, which in the spirit of the Goldfly bonus track replaces all the lyrics for the entire album with meowing.  If the sugar-coated lyrics of Keep It Together weren't your thing but you loved the music, the Meow Mix album is $2 less than the actual album.  Save money!  Love Guster!

        Musical Chairs : Your Weekly Challenge   I've decided to post a weekly challenge (every Saturday)  for the writers and readers of this blog; no prizes aside from the satisfaction of beating your peers in competition.  Entries must be received by the following Friday, in the form of comment, e-mail or blog post/link.  All very simple.  This weeks challenge is "Musical Chairs" and here is your task.  The new Broadway cash-in is to take a washed-up artist's discography and reenvision it as a heart-warming story with ubiquitous singing and dancing.  Abba, Billy Joel, Boy George... They all have their own musicals and people other than themselves are making money off of them!!!  I would like to make money too.  So, you are challenged to take any non-concept album (no Yoshimi, no Sgt. Pepper) from any artist (including the relentless V.A.) and come up with a plot synopsis with song cues.  Entries should include a list of characters and should utilize no fewer than 5 songs from the given album.  Several independent judges will be pitched each of the musicals, and their opinions will triangulate the winner.  Degree of difficulty, creativity, and marketability will factor into the final decision.  Now is your chance to give Jon Bon Jovi (or the like) immortality!

        It's Winter Time for Spring!   A co-worker and I were walking home from work and turned onto a street that I had seen blocked off with a squad car and police officers several times during the course of the day.  As we walked down the street, and I related my curiousity over the blocking, we realized we were walking through snow.  Not a lot, just along the edges of the sidewalk.  Still it's been warm in Chicago the past week, so any snow that  might  still be lingering in the shade would certainly be gone by now.  We soon discovered that the snow was not snow but actually suds, like the lather of a bikini car wash.  Fumigating?  Street washing?  We listed through the possibilites unable to accept any of them... soon noticing white plastic sheeting bolted over any grass along the street.  And as we returned to our surprise at finding "snow" we suddenly came across real snow, and more extensive sheathing of the ground around us.  We were baffled.  Suddenly, it all clicked in my mind.  El tracks, brown stones, low traffic side street, manned road block, real snow on one side, fake snow on the other...  It must have been a movie shoot.  Sure enough,  urlLink The Weather Man  had been filming scenes that day.

        Soundtrack of Our Lives   One of the things I miss most about living in a dorm is the free exchange of new music.  Hearing a song wafting in from the other room and walking in to find out who and what it is.  If I were still living in the dorms, the song you'd be hearing more than any other right now is a great pop piece called "Artists Are Boring" by the  urlLink Kingdom Flying Club .  Seemingly owing equal debts to the low-fi sound of Guided By Voices and Pavement and the polished power pop of bands like Material Issue and Weezer, Kingdom Flying Club comes to us from Columbia, MO.  For you Chicago area kiddies out there, the band actually reminds me a lot of Kleenex Girl Wonder.  Great pop sensibilities, but not afraid to get down and dirty (and fuzzy with their guitar sound).  " urlLink Artists Are Boring " is a fun slice of the band at their most polished.  Think Kinks circa "Village Green Preservation Society."  The song starts with an irresistable piano intro and holds on to your ears 'til the very end.  The band even writes a great bridge, a lost art these days, with what I believe to be mandolin carrying the melody.  "Hate Shirt," the first track of the album, goes the other direction with crunching guitar riffs and a thundering bass line.  Production is fairly clean and complements the band's sound nicely -- kind of like Ric Ocasek if he didn't suck.  If you order the album, Emergency Umbrella will even throw in free buttons and stickers. Can't beat a deal like that.

        Taking Seasame Back to the Streets   Thanks to the rise of audience specific cable channels and direct market videos, children's television has gone from a doe-eyed attempt to enlighten our kids to a brittle, plastic effort to sell Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.    Fortunately, all is not lost.  In an effort to rekindle the spirit of the Children's Television Workshop and, uhm, Rumpus Room, a group of DC artsy-types have created a kids show that tries something different.   urlLink Pancake Mountain  applies a rough around the edges punk rock aesthetic to the puppets and songs approach to children's television.  The web only pilot featured appearances from a host of indie celebrities including  urlLink Bob Mould   (as an evil executive)  urlLink Vic Chesnut  (singing a classic kids number) and  urlLink Thievery Corporation  (showing the kids how to get down).  Best of all, Fugazi's Ian MacKaye performs as the Evens in the more clever than it sounds  urlLink Vowel Movement .  Chances are Pancake Mountain's unique take on getting through to the kids will never make it over to the small screen, but if it does, it might just be a beautiful day in the neighborhood.

       Apparently, the parents of song parody emperor Weird Al Yankovic were  urlLink found dead  in their home from carbon monoxide poisoning.  I've always felt Weird Al has lived in a sort of comedy dream world where the most horrible thing to happen to him was the surreal event of Coolio threatening to throw down over  Amish Paradies ; so, it couldl be interesting to see where he goes from here with his music.  Will he retreat further into his wacky novelty world or will we, perhaps, see a darker era of his music?   Or will he make none at all?  Whatever the case, it's a stunning loss for anyone and a reminder that our bodies are fragile to the most unexpected things.

        Dreams Do Come True...    urlLink WXRT  now is (finally) steaming over the internet.  Trust me, no matter how long and hard people in Chicago complain XRT is not what is used to be, it's still at least 10 times better than almost anything else around the country, and especcially here in Rockford.  Is it what is used to be?  No, of course not.  But the strength of the station is the music  and  the DJs.  People listeners have known for more than a decade.  I would have paid to hear Bobby Skafish and Lin Brehmer and Tom Marker again.  Now I get to hear them for free.  In the first of a series, I present songs I probably would not have known about if not for XRT Streaming on the net:  Jack Johnson --  Taylor :  I liked  Flake , and I do think Johnson is more than Dave Matthews lite.  The songs I've heard from him do a great job of creating mood and feeling.   Taylor  does this perfectly and is a great acoustic guitar workout too.  At the very least it beats hearing Britney Spears for the 100th time on the Top 40 station out here or more Jackson Browne on the classic rock station.

        Forget You   Then you see a movie like  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  and everything gets put into perspective.  A perfect piece of humanistic science fiction.  Aside from Charlie Kaufman's fairly regular brilliance, you also must remove your hat and then hand it over with a family heirloom to Michel Gondry for being able to pull this off so eloquently.  I could say more, but it is probably best that you don't know anything about the movie going in...  Yeah, it's one of those.  But like I said, it's eloquent about it.

        Red Right Hand    urlLink Hellboy Movie  is bad.  Even if Guillermo Del Toro and company were able to  urlLink fight off requests  for a Blue Hellboy or an Incredible Hulkboy, they seem to have let the soul of the character slip through their red, stoney hand.  On the outside, Hellboy is a bulky, crimson demon with shaved down horn and a collossal rock of a right hand, which as far as he has figured out is good for smashing things.  Movie Hellboy is very insecure with this form, having been raised by humans.  All Movie Hellboy really wants is to be a real boy, to freely associate with people.  He is driven by this desire.  In an effort to close the gap between him and the social life of man, he raises cats, watches cartoons, falls in love and, in general, becomes the quintessential, stereotypical, run-of-the-mill freak.  On the other hand, comics Hellboy (the real Hellboy) doesn't really care.  He sees himself as being part of humanity, even if a giant, abnormal part.  In fact, humanity sees him as part of humanity (the United Nations gave him Honorary Human status in 1952).  The central conflict for the source material Hellboy is his stuggle to eradicate his relation with demons/evil despite his Nazi-funded inception as the key to armageddon (something which plays out quite literally in the film).  While the difference between the two is subtle, it's integral to the identity and actions of Hellboy.  You see, Hellboy's superpower is not shooting flames out of his eyes or eating your soul; he can't lift objects with his mind, he can't fly, he doesn't command the weather and he certainly has no psychic ability.  What Hellboy does do is get the crap beat out of him.  As he hunts down what are essentially his own kind, Hellboy is pummelled to the edge of death, his strength and durability lasting him just long enough for heaven and fate to sign an agreement on how to get him out of the mess.  And the movie captures this (and, off the subject, the color pallette) fairly well.  But again, the movie misses the essence of his beatings.  Hellboy is humanity's scapegoat, taking the brunt of Hell's active attempts to seize the world, buying time for providence to patiently reveal itself.  He isn't Clifford the Big, Red Dog, he's the friggin' hinge of of the apocalypse.  He has to fight to prevent it, but his encounters put him closer to the thing he is really meant to be by Hell.  If the spirit is gone, the shell is empty.  The plot that the movie is based on, "Seed of Destruction", certainly needed some filling in order to make a quality, full-length feature film.  But instead of adding additional plot or remixing the Hellboy series (like what we saw with  X-Men 2 ), Hellboy Movie's creators made scattered tweaks that are more destructive to the essence of the story than removing Hellboy's horns would have been.  For instance.  The frogmen of the comics have become hellhounds...  who lay frog eggs, are amphibious and have long tongues for grabbing prey.  Why!?  Why!?  It's a classic and pointless Hollywood tweak that helps to wipe away the myth and lore Hellboy stories are drawn from.  Another glaring alteration not directly related to the Hellboy character is Kroenen.  In the comics, the guy is a masked, laboratory-dwelling rogue among the Nazi collective that summons Hellboy; in Hellboy Movie he's a particularly noisy and particularly showy (in Star Wars Kid fashion) assassin.  While it adds a mini-boss to the film, it does nothing to build upon the source story in any meaningful way.  Again, we have a ineffectual, standard Hollywood "solution".  The gilled assistant to Hellboy, Abe Sapien has also been altered, this time into a nerdy jester, the intended comic relief.  I always felt like Abe played the straight man to Hellboy's smarmy attitude in the comics; it may just be the rebel in me, but I have a hard time believing that a comic relief character was necessary especially when he gets written out of the story in Act 2.  Also an ill-advised move since in the book Abe kills the Rasputin "head boss" (see the paragraph on Hellboy in action above for an understanding of why it works this way).   The film's creators sell-out minor elements left-and-right, while defending their ability to create Hellboy exactly as he appeared in the comics.  There are moments in Hellboy that work extremely well, the fight scenes, a scene where Hellboy spies on his love interest and another agent out on a friendly date, the general adherence to the source.  But the movie takes a slightly problematic adaptation and makes it more scatter-brained and incoherent while attempting the exact opposite.  The bar for action comic book movies is pretty low, though, and I really feel the movie is no worse than most of that crop.   Spiderman  was maybe a tad better, and  X2  and the early  Batman  movies look down from the tops of Gotham City skyscrapers at  Hellboy .  But for the most part, it's on par for the course.  The larger issue is that the filmmaking community still has no idea how to adapt a comic book, an absolutely ridiculous point since the storyboards are basically laid out for them ahead of time.  These aren't 400-page novels with internal narrative; they're very simple projects...  Few lessons have been learned from the exceptions (the action movies above plus  Ghost World  and  American Splendor ).  This saddens me because the  Watchmen  movie  is  going to get made some day, and I'm afraid one of the great pinnacles of comics is going to be merely satisfactory.

       I am finding myself believing very strongly in this idea, that any government that commits genocide should be deemed by the international community as commiting an act of war against global society.  Eventually, if the world can hang onto its gonads, the fuckers  urlLink will learn  that they're not going to get anywhere by slaughtering our fellow citizens.  That we sit around  urlLink feigning blindness to mass killings  is abhorrent.  It should be a given that any leader who abuses his power will be taken from it by the entire civilized world.  And it should be made explicit what is going on, to leave no question to the people of any region that those in power over them (elected or by force) have committed the single act that the world will not stand by to.  Say it like that; let there be no argument.  The second part of this is that the UN should have a substantial branch devoted to nation-building whether post-war or no-war.  Specialists should be brought into (or called upon by) wavering nations to assist in the planning and establishment of a solid economy and government.  If a military attack is the House of Representatives, with the biggest guns bringing their biggest guns, nation-building should be the Senate, with equal participation by all members.  This is the most crucial step to cutting off oppressive regimes: eliminating the desperation that allows for them.  Iraq is important to this in its effect.  If the war and nation-building is successful, we bring strength to a global battle for human rights.  It is a strength that could effectively  stop  the need for an attack; we are already seeing this in our dealings with certain nations, we will see it more if we can complete our goals.  (Honestly, if John Kerry is going to be the one to best finish that effort, give him the presidency.  But, I want to know that he's going to be able to overcome Bush's shortcomings.  Open the can or keep it on the shelf, John Kerry.)  The  most  important thing in this type of policy, though, is universal support for it.  Can you get that?  I dunno.  How many countries celebrate Memorial Day?  (links from  urlLink Instapundit )

       Sorry about the lack of posts this week; I've been spending some good time with friends and haven't had the oppurtunity to sit and type up everything I've been wanting to fill this space with.  Also, tremendous apologies to Chicago Blogs individuals.  Again, I haven't had time to figure out how to get a links section working in this site's new layout template.  I'm finishing up the first season of American Ninja Underground and will post the entire final Act in about a week.  I like what ANU has become, but it's very different from the direction I had originally envisioned it going.  Really, it's become an action version of my short-lived newspaper strip "In Pictorium", the problem being that my long-term interest in the ANU world was dependent on the human story I wanted to tell - not something IP was built to do.  As I've said before, I have a plan to drastically change the presentation of the comic and I feel it will create a better environment for the type of thing I want ANU to be as it matures.  Before that, I'll be playing with a series tentatively called Alternate Realities, which will be a sort of freak show of classic superheroes living very different lives.  Homeless Wolverine will be a regular.  Also news to everyone except myself...  Realtime Record Reviews will be launching by the end of June.  This'll be one of those side-projects I promised back at the point that I brokedown the old RF structure.  I'm anticipating an expansive update of Dogmi as well.  And "Tom Waits Sings the Hits"...  ...you'll just have to wait to hear about that, though.  Yes, it will hopefully all come together soon.

       Bad news for Cubs fans.   urlLink Kerry Wood will have a bone scan performed today  after shutting down a throwing session yesterday after eight pitches.  This after he shut down a throwing session last week after nine pitches.   The bad news (or worse news) is this will not be a short-term thing.  Going by what I have observed with this injury and other like it, Wood may be done for the season.  At the very least, I would expect him to be out for two months or so.  With the way the Cubs have tried to cover up their players' injuries this year, the news shouldn't come as much of a surprise.  Wood's injury will be a long-term thing.  Mark my words.  Without Wood, the Cubs are still dangerous.  When Mark Prior returns, a top end of the rotation of Prior/Clement/Zambrano is still one most teams would love to have.  Maddux as a #4 isn't the worst thing in the world either.  But judging by the way Prior and Wood have succumbed to injuries this year after being abused like a rented mule last year by Dusty Baker, it wouldn't surprise me to see Zambrano miss some time this year as well.  Are Cubs fans happy Baker left Wood in for 131 pitches the second week of the season to try to get him a complete game victory?  That's the game Wood was ejected from for arguing balls and strike in the ninth.  While that alone may not have caused an injury, it's still a great example of how Baker treats his pitchers.  It's OK though.  The White Sox are in first place and are playing tomorrow night at home.  Half-price night.  Just take the red line in the opposite direction.  You can't miss it.

        O Wait.  It is.   Edited by underground comic lord Chris Ware,  urlLink McSweeney's 13  promises a treasure trove of other alternative artistry from all the majors, Daniel Clowes, Joe Sacco, Richard Sala, Charles Burns, Adrian Tomine, Joe Matt, Art Spiegelman, Crumb, Seth, Kaz...  with late sketches from Charles Schulz and George Herriman.  The list is a remarkable roster of heavy-hitting Raw alums and a nice cross section of talent across the alternative comics realm.    The volume is exquisite, and there's really few other words to describe it.  It's got all the quirky attention to detail that people love in both Chris Ware and McSweeney's.  The hardcover volume, reminiscent of the Acme Novelty Datebook, is wrapped in a funny-pages-of-yore mock-up of Chris Ware "round guy" comics (its reverse side is the contributor list).  Hidden within the folds of the paper are a pair of mini-comics, rounding out a full representation of underground comics formats.  So, that's why I was ecstatic as I left  urlLink Chicago Comics  with the heavy volume at my side.  And maybe I had gotten my hopes up, I'll give you that but...  Blegh.  The volume is certainly nice, and anyone who doesn't frequent the work of the artists I've listed above will probably find it rewarding.  It's also a great collector's piece... your grandkids (or grandkids' grandkids for those not in my personal demographic) will look at it and yearn for the days when art was on paper.  The most upsetting thing is that the volume is for the most part, excerpts from recent longer works.  Sacco's piece is from his tremendous  The Fixer  released last fall, Tomine brings his latest Optic Nerve to the table, Art Spiegelman reiterates the mess that is "In the Shadow of No Towers", Ware's work will be no stranger to those who read the regular Acme Novelty series in alt-weeklies, and it continues to the point that you're startled when you see somethign without the words "excerpt from" in front of it.   Bless Jeffrey Brown for his unpublished pile of sketchbooks that are always releasing fresh pieces.  If this wasn't comics... if this was, for instance, an anthology of "short stories", this thing would be torn apart for what it's trying to present itself as.  There is little new here for those that would be most interested in it.  I'd think McSweeney's would have the clout to get some original or rare work from this line-up.  I'd be wrong.

       Remember the golden days of puzzle games?  Nintendo threw every mixture of colored blocks they could at us and we let it all build up until we got the really long straight piece and then...  everything disappeared.  I mean, there was a point when the characters from Street Fighter had their own  urlLink puzzle game , when you'd have a couple editions of Bust-A-Move a year (there have been at least 26 iterations since the game debuted in 1993), when people shared their Tetris high scores over a bottle of wine...  Tetris is still a friggin great game, and I still haven't gotten the  urlLink space shuttle to launch  in the regular mode...  Snood - which you might consider a Bust-A-Move clone - hit the  urlLink nation's universities  for a while, and ultimately turned from shareware into a full console release...  But it was  urlLink ugly as sin .  What would happen if someone made a simple, interesting,  new  puzzle game that utilized the 3d processing of even base-level PCs - or at least took some advantage of the tremendous color depth of contemporary displays?  Probably, the gorgeous  urlLink Zuma .  The rule set is basic, the construction is elegant, and the result is a game that demands creativity and coordination.  Colored balls slowly roll down a winding track towards a consuming hole.  Your goal is to stop them, often by stringing palindrome combos so stunning that they temporarily reverse gravity's downward pull.  It's not going to be a phenom (not because of any fault of the game), but if your heart is ever warmed thinking about the proper techniques for placing a z-block or the time you thread the needle to topple three-quarters of a Snood board... Reawaken that slumbering puzzle gamer and try out Zuma.

       Frequent readers of this blog will recall our previous reporting that trendy burrito-for-white-people place  urlLink Chipotle  changed their salsas for "more freshness".  I've been shocked the past few days to discover that Romaine lettuce may be going the way of Ye Ole Green Chili Salsa.  Lettuce has always been a tangential ingredient at Chipotle; at both the stores I frequent, you will be asked if you want every ingredient short of the lettuce.  I'll admit I don't get asked about the guacamole all that often, but it's a lot more often than lettuce.  So, it comes as no surprise that Romaine takes the hit, but I'm in mourning nevertheless.  The last tin in the line at my current Chipotle is now filled with Iceberg, so-called and so-identified due to its pale color.  Apparently, I will use more nutrients eating Iceberg than I will gain from it.  And I am currently paying almost a dollar more for a Chipotle burrito now than when they came with Romain lettuce  and  Green Greatest-Salsa-of-All-Time Chili Salsa.  *sigh  Edit: Must have been an emergency thing.  We're back to Romaine.  Woot.

       In order to provide a more efficient blog that will take advantage of a number of the new components of Blogger, TMSO will be going through a design change.  This  may  effect some things negatively in the short term, but over time these issues will be resolved and you should find the new setup to be much friendlier in your (and our) usage of the blog.  The basic setup will probably remain the same from the time I post this, but you will see some drastic changes in the visual appearance of the blog as I modify the template in the next few days.  Here is your update list:  -Permalinks : You can now link specific posts to send to friends via e-mail or posting on your own blog / website.  -Monthly Archives : As a result of permalinks, I've decided to archive monthly instead of weekly; this will allow the archives to be integrated into the blog's main page.  -Integrated Comments : Comments are no longer a plug-in, which means comments will be stored in the archives and should be easier to use.  -Photos!!! : Thanks to the new design, you'll be seeing photos and artwork posted in the blog regularly.  -Better XML Support : We are settling what is essentially a stylesheet for posts so that those using news feeder programs will see a cleaner presentation of posts.

        NO MO MILES   I first heard about the overestimated efficiency of hybrid cars from Kristi after she attended a lecture on "green" products at the Field Museum.  Apparently, the cars use a similar amount of fuel as regular cars across for the first few miles of driving.  But, Wired reports that even the long trip  urlLink fuel efficiency is bogus .  Consumers have found the cars, which were reported to get nearly 50 miles per gallon, seldom top 30 miles per gallon.  30!!!  The Toyota Prius is on the high end at a still disappointing 35, while the Honda Civic Hybrid gets only 26!  For comparison purposes, the  urlLink Corporate Average Fuel Economy  (CAFE) for passenger cars is 27.5 mpg; it is 20.7 mpg for light trucks (SUVs, etc).  The problem - and you can read about this in the Wired article - is that the  urlLink EPA standards  measure waste substances from fuel consumption not the actual use of fuel.  I'm no physicist nor automotive expert, so I can't tell you why that throws off the tests for hybrids... but needless to say, it apparently does.

       Saw  urlLink Okkervil River  (aka Coner Oberst With a Soul) at  urlLink Schuba's  on Saturday night.  I can't say enough about this band, but that's not going to keep me from trying.  Seeing a band that's emotionally involved in their music at a live show after months of their being on the road is exhilirating, and that's what the Okkervils provided to an - to be polite - eclectic post-midnight crowd.  As tired as the image of a rocker breaking crap on stage is, you can't deny that you love seeing it, especially when there's some honesty to it.  The amazing thing about the outbursts of raw musical emotion for the Okkervils is that their music is heady and introspective.  The centerpiece of the new album is a song about  urlLink empathizing with war criminals  for instance.  Yet there we were, rocking - by the true sense of the word - to the lyric "While you gasp at my bloody crimes, / please take the time / to make your heart my own."  And we could feel it; there was nothing ironic about the moment.  This is a band that in another life would be overly pretentious crap; indeed, opener and spin-off project  urlLink Shearwater  pretty much is.  But somehow, it works right through a balance of tranquil calms and torrid rapids.

Apple's music service has agreed to  urlLink hike its prices  by 26 cents per song and in many cases seven dollars per album.

        Weekly Challenge : Past Masters and the First Third   The Musical Chairs challenge is still open although it will be closed by the next time I have a day off of work (just two more out of the nine I've had to work left to go).  But here is your new challenge; something much easier and also music related.  Everyone can participate with little craft-work, so everyone is encouraged to.  The new challenge is called "Past Masters and the First Third."   Part One   Every year we do this thing called the Lost Sock Collections which is an exchanging of mix-cd's featuring each participant's top ten albums of the year.  What I find is that a few months later, due in part to the LSC and in part to ambling through record stores, my list would have looked quite different.  However, the calendar-year-centered environment we create with "Top Ten of **" lists prevents late-comers from being garnished with attention.  The artists still make money off old albums, and the listeners can still enjoy the albums though, so maybe we should give a little more praise to what we missed.  Thus, the first part of this challenge is to name a double-plus good 2003 album(s) that you first heard in 2004.   Part Two   Albums from the early months of any calendar year generally lose ground in annual top-lists due to the added competition, the freshness of that competition and the flaws of human memory.  Arguably, a truly great album should be remembered over the course of a year, but is it fair that late-comers don't have to stand up to the same test?  In order to give the underdogs their own place, TMSO issues this simple challenge.  Name your favorite 2004 release(s) thus far.  Fulfill your challenge as a comment below or as a separate  urlLink e-mail  and all entries will be put together for a future post.

        Wired Notes   Came across a few great quotes from the May issue of Wired.   Cult Life for the Atari 2600   (page 74)   urlLink Homestar Runner  is getting console game treatment with an RPG-style game for the barbaric Atari 2600.  Do you remember when we banged rocks together in order to make Pitfall Harry leap upon crocodile heads?  Other people do, and Atari gaming has been making a kitschy comeback because of it.  You can purchase joysticks whose bases are bundled with a small museum of these ancestral video games.  There is also a blossoming homebrew scene using actual cartridges.  And now this.  A "commercial" release.  Great quote from the Wired write-up on cameos by classic Atari characters, "If it's 8 pixels wide and a single color, it'll be in there."   Fear and Loathing of Information  (page 193)  John Poindexter is what Wired refers to as "the Pentagon's Big Brother in chief", a guy trying to organize intelligence so that it can be better used to capture would-be-terrorists.  In Wired's interview, Poindexter talks theory about what he is trying to do in broadening intelligence powers.  To the statement "Your critics never relented on privacy questions," Poindexter responds...  "Advocacy groups want to stay in business, so it's in their interest to paint a dire picture."  A point I've been becoming increasingly aware of recently...  If the problems are solved, the solvers are out of a job.  I'll probably post a lot more on this in coming days/months.   The Facts Get Clearer the Further We Get From Them  (page 135)  In an article on the MPAA's in-school anti-piracy lesson capsules, the reporter says, "The real point, of course, is to protect Hollywood from the fate of the record industry."  What's telling about the quote is how the RIAA's claim (that MP3 swapping has devoured their business) has become a given, despite no clear evidence of its truth (just because the animal has four legs doesn't mean that it's had its business destroyed by peer-to-peer).  Is piracy a problem?  Sure.  Is piracy crippling the RIAA?  No.  An idiotic business model is.  The MPAA continues to strengthen itself  despite  a dramatic increase in movie piracy as faster connections and more efficient file-sharing progs are released...  "Hollywood has seen revenue rise 27 percent in the same four-year period that the recording industry went into free fall."  Look at what Hollywood has been offering customers...  big, fat collector's editions of even the worst movies on high quality discs.  They're reaping what they sow.

       On Sunday,  urlLink the White Sox traded  starting catcher Miguel Olivo, top prospect outfielder Jeremy Reed, and AA shortstop Michael Morse for pitcher Freddy Garcia and catcher Ben Davis.  In short.  White Sox general manager Kenny Williams was taken for a ride.  Yet again.  Before I say anything else, I must say that Freddy Garcia is a very good pitcher.  He will help the Sox this year and is better than what the team was throwing out there.  But...   *He's a free agent after this season.  The Sox have rented him for three months in exchange for a great haul of prospects for Seattle.  There's no guarantee the team will be able to re-sign him, and with this organization's history with pitchers, I don't feel confident he'll be back.   *Garcia is moving from a severe pitcher's park to a severe hitter's park.  Plus he's a flyball pitcher coming to Coors East in Comiskey.  His numbers will almost undoubtedly suffer.   *He's had ERAs of 4.39 and 4.50 the past two seasons.  Yes, in 100 IP this year, he's been better.  But I'm not going to discount the past two seasons just because he's off to a nice start.   Now the White Sox have a giant, gaping hole at catcher.  I believe at this point the Sox have the worst catching situation in the majors.  Alomar is old, not productive, and probably just should have been hired as the bench coach instead of Baines.  Let's not let 30 at bats this year cloud the fact Jamie Burke is a 31-year-old career minor leaguer.  And Ben Davis has been a huge disappointment.  A .670 career OPS.  Striking out 1 out of ever 3.9 at bats in his career. OBPs routinely less than .300.  SLG less than .400.  Add to the catching hole the fact that Crede has been struggling all season long and may or may not turn it on.  Willie Harris was just in a huge 0-fer slump.  Juan Uribe is 4 for his last 31.  Aaron Rowand, great against LHP, still can't hit right-handers.  And now the team's one productive catcher is gone.   Compare what the Royals got for Carlos Beltran, a superior player, to what the Sox had to give up for Garcia.  KC got 3 decent prospects, the best being Mark Teahen.  The Sox gave up a starting ML catcher, one of the best prospects in all of baseball in Jeremy Reed, and another Top Ten prospect in the organization in Mike Morse.  Seem equal?  Of course not.  Not to mention that just two years ago all the booty KW could get for All-Star Ray Durham was Jon freaking Adkins.   I know the Sox have organizational depth in the outfield, but Reed was the one "untouchable" guy in the organization.  He's a left-handed bat with great patience, decent power, good speed, and the ability to play center field.  Reed is the best hitting prospect this organization has had since Frank Thomas.  He walks, something most players in the Sox oganization are afraid to do.  And if the rumors are true about Bavasi wanting Crede, but the Sox forcing him to take Reed -- well, that's ridiculous.  Would you rather see a hole at catcher and Crede at 3B or Olivo catching, Uribe at third, and a Rowand/Perez platoon in CF?  Especially since the Sox just drafted Josh Fields in the first round who, god willing, will supplant Crede at third in two years anyway.   "Going for the jugular" and "being aggressive" are great things.  But it didn't work in 2001 with David Wells.  It didn't work in 2002 with Todd Ritchie.  It didn't work in 2003 with Bartolo Colon and Billy Koch.  It didn't work in 2003 with Carl Everett and Roberto Alomar.  And there is NO guarantee it will work this year either.  The difference being never has so much of this team's future been put on the line for potential present success.  Olivo still had 5 years under Sox control.  Reed hadn't played a game in the majors yet and is just about as sure of a thing as there is in the minors.   If the White Sox make the World Series this year, I'll take it all back.  I'll never question KW again.  But, I still don't think this team is strong enough to do that.  I hope I'm wrong.  Nothing will make me happier.   My bottom line?  Garcia will help this year, but the only way the trade will make sense is if the Sox make the World Series.  If not, we have just mortgaged a HUGE part of the future for the right to finish with 84 wins instead of 82.

        urlLink Pitchfork Media  has compiled the Top 100 Albums of the 1970's, which apparently consisted of listing every album Brian Eno had even a partial fingerprint on.  There were mistakes, ovbiously, but better to discuss are the complete misses.  What follows are the Top Nine albums to be ignored by Pitchfork on their list.  I'd place each of these in my personal Top 20, if not maybe 30 of that decade.  If any of these bands had just hired Brian Eno to turn a knob in the studio...  1.   urlLink  Elvis Costello -- Armed Forces   (1979, Columbia)   If there's room for 16 Brian Eno albums and 25 David Bowie discs, there's gotta be room for the third release of the decase from the best songwriter of his generation.  "This Year's Model" popped in the list at #52 with "My Aim Is True" at #37.    2.   urlLink  Rolling Stones -- Sticky Fingers    (1971, Virgin)   Are you kidding?  One Stones album on the entire list?  While "Exile" has the reputation, it's "Sticky Fingers" that is the Stones at their absolute apex.  "Let It Bleed" still held onto some of the styles of the '60s, but "Sticky Fingers" had the band roaring into the new decade with the underrated Mick Taylor helping to shape the band's sound.   3.   urlLink  Joe Jackson -- Look Sharp!    (1979, A&M)   The list ignores a lot (or all) of the late-70's Angry-Young-Man/New Wave/pub rock, which is surprising since this stuff isn't very far away from The Clash (ranked #2) or bands like the Ramones.  Joe Jackson's debut is a masterpiece, bouncing through different genres like two drunks on the bumper cars at the circus.  Of all the albums on my list, I'm probably most surprised this didn't crack Pitchfork's 100 or EVEN GET ONE SINGLE FREAKING VOTE.  "I'm The Man" appeared on one list.  (sarcastic clapping begins)   4.   urlLink  Gram Parsons -- GP     (1972, Reprise)   The list ignores most (or all) of country music in the 70s, even groundbreaking stuff like Gram Parsons' two albums.  Apparently, listening to less popular genres of music is only OK if it makes you look cool.  Dance, disco, funk, jazz and Kraftwerk are all over Pitchfork's list.  But the man who basically invented country-rock and paved the way for the 90s alt.country movement gets no credit.   5.  urlLink  Graham Parker -- Squeezing Out Sparks    (1979, Arista)   See comments for #3.  Parker was more focused with his effort, however.  This is the sound of a man with complete confidence in his craft.     6.   urlLink  Flamin' Groovies -- Flamingo    (1970, Kama Sutra)   One of the latest, greatest forgotten bands.  The Groovies smoked on three early 70's releases.  Keith Richards once said the Groovies album "Tennage Head" is what he wished "Sticky Fingers" turned out to be.  I prefer one release before that album, "Flamingo."  Check out the guitar outro solo on "Heading For the Texas Border."    7.   urlLink  AC/DC -- Highway To Hell    (1979, Atco)   "Highway To Hell" was AC/DC's finest moment.  Bon Scott's last album with the group.  If Van Halen's debut album cracked the list, this also needed to have a spot.    8   urlLink  The Kinks -- Lola vs. the Powerman & the Money-Go-Round, Pt. 1    (1970, Reprise)   The Kinks had finished off back-to-back slices of British life with "Village Green Preservation Society" and "Arthur."  "Lola..." is a step below the high-water marks of those two albums, but still a tremendous effort from one of the most underrated bands of all-time.   9.  urlLink  New York Dolls -- New York Dolls    (1973, Mercury)   Put simply, this is better than anything the Stooges ever released.  And both "Funhouse" and "Raw Power" made the list.  Make some room for the band with the guy who would later become Buster Poindexter and record "Hot, Hot, Hot!"   I'll take comments.  I'll even respond.

       The female lead of  Dodgeball  and  Zoolander ,  urlLink Christine Taylor , who I feel has been in 85% of similar comedies (she hasn't, but does embody the archetype), was Melody on Nickelodeon's  urlLink Hey Dude .  She's also Ben Stiller's wife.  Sadly, she's the only  Hey Dude  alum to successfully move beyond tv (or beyond  Hey Dude  at all...).  Ted was in  White Squall  and Mr. Ernst was an ER regular.  And that's it.  On a related note for all you non-Trekkers (and all you Trekkers as of yet unaware), the ex-wife at the heart of Jack Ryan's (Republican running for Senate)  nail-in-the-coffin scandal  is none other than Jeri Ryan, Seven-of-Nine from Star Trek : Voyager.

       I really enjoyed  urlLink Coffee and Cigarettes , the recently released film of black-and-white vignettes featuring mismatches of musicians and actors.  There's enough change in style between segments that each sketch is fresh in its cute-and-awkwardness.  But one thing I found tiring was director/writer Jim Jarmusch's absolutist treatment of silence in dialogue as a rift in communication.  Whenever characters are quiet they appear to be at odds with their counterparts, realizing their train is somewhere in Albuquerque they are plainly contemplating catching a ride back to Buffalo.  Iggy Pop contemplates leaving Tom Waits, whom he has inadvertently offended.  Cate Blanchett restrategizes her conversation with a black sheep cousin (Cate Blanchett).  Pauses are never comfortable.  In real dialogue, though, the pause can imply an exact understanding: a way for conversers to think the same thought without speaking over each other, to conversely observe an event or item, to actually communicate via body language or simply through the lack of speech.  We don't find such silence in  Coffee and Cigarettes ; a pause is a certain sign of a derailed conversation.  True, the movie is largely about uncomfortable combinations (why else pair Bill Murray with RZA and GZA).  But there are mutual moments in the positive spaces, so why not the negative space?  In a movie so intimately focussed on  unpaced , diner conversation, heavily one-sided use of momentary pauses is a definite weakness. Moments of silence are tense because of it.  A tempo has been set; breaks feel unnatural and can leave the audience feeling as awkward as the characters on the screen.  Of course, maybe that's the point.

       A good explanation about why a lot of us get so worked up about You-Know-Who's recent diatribes (from Christopher Hitchens on  urlLink Slate ):  "So I know, thanks, before you tell me, that a documentary must have a "POV" or point of view and that it must also impose a narrative line. But if you leave out absolutely everything that might give your "narrative" a problem and throw in any old rubbish that might support it, and you don't even care that one bit of that rubbish flatly contradicts the next bit, and you give no chance to those who might differ, then  you have betrayed your craft . If you flatter and fawn upon your potential audience, I might add, you are patronizing them and insulting them. By the same token, if I write an article and I quote somebody and for space reasons put in an ellipsis like this (…), I swear on my children that I am not leaving out anything that, if quoted in full, would alter the original meaning or its significance. Those who violate this pact with readers or viewers are to be despised."

       I'm constantly on a soapbox about how getting free MP3s online from bands is pretty much the only way to be exposed to new music.  So why don't more bands do it?  Here's a great piece on  urlLink indie artists and their websites   from John Scalzi's blog.  This is the bottom line: I want to hear new music.  I can't hear it on the radio.  I live in Rockford.  No one plays here.  The only way I can hear it is on the web.  It's the only way I can hear about bands like the  urlLink Kingdom Flying Club  and  urlLink Runner and the Thermodynamics .  I've bought CDs from both bands in the last few months based solely upon MP3s I've downloaded online.  This is the way things should work.  Next time I'm ambitious (hopefully tomorrow), another post on the glut of great music that will be released in the next few weeks/months.  Someone's got to pick up the slack while Mike's on vacation.

       Small-time publisher  urlLink Ben Brown  is taking duties over for the week at the  urlLink Bookslut blog  and has been doing a nice job.  He's not a link sniffer like full-timer Jessa Crispin, but he's a bit better at expounding on the links he does have.  It's a One Week Only kind of thing and should be interesting to anyone who likes books but doesn't screw every one he/she sees.

       I'm inclined to tell you that the Nikon Coolpix 5200 (and 4200) is the real deal.  Pulled one out of the box today and was floored.  The camera is hardly larger than its younger sisters (2200, 3200), but is almost half as thin with a metal face plate.  Lithium rechargeable battey, sexy menu system, and what may be the fastest shutter/autofocus response time I've found on a digicam so far - which, as I tell most customers, has been the number one complaint from digital camera buyers.  People should go nuts over this thing...  As long as the image quality is there, the camera is going to be hot hot hot.  I'll try and take some pics and post them here.  In the very least, I'll describe the results to you.  A disappointing three day weekend ends today.

       I was beginning to think that a mythic Saturday afternoon where my friend John and I discovered (upon my dad's recommendation) the Star Wars knock-off  Message from Space  was just a dream.  As I would attest to others, unable to provide evidence, the story is centered around a galactic struggle over magic walnuts.  Not mystic globs resembling walnuts...  Magic walnuts, literal, period.   urlLink Vic Morrow  is a professional drunk.  Wood sailing ships float around space at full mast.  Things happen for no explicable reason.  Film Threat proves that it exists and others have seen it (click title for link), and  urlLink this site  has a full synopsis and sound clips.

       Here is some free punditry for you based on my scattershot viewings of the Democratic National Convention, the highlight of which was figuring out the different time delays between networks and then switching between them to hear the same word up to four times.    Bill Clinton: &nbsp; Clinton proved why he's remembered for his charisma and speaking skills; far and away the strongest speaker at the convention.&nbsp; Well-written jokes that were equally well delivered.&nbsp; He's smooth and at ease and almost conversational.   Al Gore: &nbsp; Gore spoke to his audience like they were stupid, stupid children.&nbsp; Make no mistake, he should have won in 2000...&nbsp; it was handed to him and he blew it.&nbsp; This speech showed why.   Obama: &nbsp; The man with no one to run against is the new star of the Democratic party.&nbsp; I imagine Democrats are thinking what sportswriters have been thinking about Michael Vick since watching him do that-crazy-thing-he-does...&nbsp; Please don't let anything happen to him.   John Edwards: &nbsp; For all the praise he gets about being a great orator...&nbsp; Bleh.&nbsp; Not a bad speech, but the kind of speech&nbsp;that would be considered&nbsp;quality&nbsp;from a Cheney or a Gephardt or a not-so-good-speaker.&nbsp; Edwards reputation sets him on another plane, where speaking actually turns votes.&nbsp; And it's on that plane that he fails.&nbsp; BONUS NOTE:&nbsp; Very socialist undertones.&nbsp; SUPER EXTRA BONUS NOTE:&nbsp; Edwards did demonstrate that if you don't mention the opposition, you can say whatever the hell you want.&nbsp; This could actually be an effective rhetorical strategy in the long haul to November.   John Kerry: &nbsp; Didn't see it.&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; But I wanted to mention that Kerry's delivery oftentimes reminds me of the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror with Bill Clinton and Bob Dole being replaced with aliens.&nbsp; From Kerry stumping today (and not an unusual thing):&nbsp; "We need to reach, reach, reach for the future."&nbsp; From Kang (or was it Kodos?): "Always twirling, twirling, twirling towards the future."

       "They have a total ability to block out anything they don't want to get through... that's what makes this animal so scary."  ...in an advertising sense.  Wired has  urlLink this story  on what advertisers are doing to recapture a generation that doesn't listen to their messages.  There's a suggestion here that we are on the brink of a marketing revolution.

       It's no secret that once you've gotten on  urlLink Pitchfork 's bad side that you ain't comin back.&nbsp; The only thing the magazine loves more than holding a grudge is pretending to struggle not to.   Certain bands are given a protection clause, which gives them a few albums to muck up before being thrown to the fire.&nbsp; Perennial favorites like Radiohead or The White Stripes are included here.&nbsp; But most receive the termination of contract notice in the mail and will never regain their former status.&nbsp; The Eels, Ryan Adams and Pedro the Lion have all produced slump-ceasing records which have&nbsp;regained for them some respect elsewhere while they continue to dig through dumpsters at Pitchfork.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a bit like an individual who has gone through a difficult and public divorce...&nbsp; They may rebuild their lives into something truly joyful, but they'll never fully discard their painful past, and those who saw the painful moments will never be able to look at them the same.&nbsp; Damien Gough, the Badly Drawn Boy, is&nbsp;a member of the Pitchfork Pit of Eternal Despair&nbsp;and proves so with his latest album   urlLink One Plus One is One  .   But what's interesting in the  urlLink Pitchfork review of the album &nbsp;is the introduction's focus on Gough's weird tie to another on Pitchfork's blacklist...&nbsp; Nick Hornby.   Hornby is part of this weird&nbsp;group of fringe mainstream writers who, upon receiving commercial success, began attempts to&nbsp;yank increasingly popular underground artists into the mainstream light.&nbsp; These artists became Lottery millionaires who really could have earned their own way to wealth&nbsp;but now&nbsp;stand without&nbsp;legitimacy to their riches.&nbsp; It's the classic story of the one-hit wonders and the sell-outs.&nbsp; It's just that instead of a faceless money-hungry corporation, the source is a creator who wants to share their achievements with other artists they respect.&nbsp; What makes it even weirder is that the benefactors enter and set up residence in the world of those they benefact.&nbsp; Nick Hornby's venture in music criticism and Michael Chabon's work with comics are probably the two most prevalent, current&nbsp;examples.&nbsp; In both these cases, neither has earned their right to the new land they've staked out, they've just gone in and taken it (as a provision of the Fair Housing Act?).   The result of it all is&nbsp;hollow wish fulfillment that depletes both parties.&nbsp; I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to donate one's fame or wealth to those below you.&nbsp; The detrimental thing is to graft one's self to a championed cause as opposed to feeding it so that it can grow.

       Gorgeous, cool day here in Chicago (perfect football weather a few months too early) following a brutally hot and ugly yesterday.&nbsp; Took some pictures which I'll share as soon as the new comp is assembled.  Guts for my desktop computer are on order, so hopefully I'll be back to actually working on the site in a week or so.  Kristi and I went to go see Tim Howard of Soltero at a coffee shop up by Wrigley Field.&nbsp; The act after him was his complete antithesis.&nbsp; In a world&nbsp;where the events of movies like  Drumline ,  Bring It On  and&nbsp; You Got Served  are real, Tim and Jeff&nbsp;(whatever his last name was) would&nbsp;have to have had (!!!) a guitar fight.&nbsp; (Tim would have to be given bad choreography just to make the fight look fair.&nbsp;)&nbsp; Howard is a scrawny, pale, straight-haired, smartass cynicist from Boston.&nbsp; His nemesis was a fit, tan, curly-locked, sincere romantic from California.&nbsp; Strum skirmish!&nbsp; Chord combat!&nbsp; A borrowed guitar pick&nbsp;unfortunately kept things civil.  Eightball 23 is a nice comic from Daniel Clowes, but honestly, the best thing I picked up from the comics shop last week was Infinite Kung Fu.&nbsp;&nbsp;omg.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Kill Bill gave you any joy, run to your local comics shop and buy some&nbsp;IKF immediately.&nbsp; Review is upcoming.&nbsp;

       I saw  Napoleon Dynamite  for the second time last night.  It makes me laugh.  Stylistically, it's an MTV Films clone of Wes Anderson.  As a hybrid of the two, it works.  Only occasionally is  Napoleon Dynamite  detrimentally reminiscent, and even then the moments are too hilarious to pay too much attention to.  Honestly, there are plenty of reasons not to like the movie.  If you don't think the whole Napoleon Dynamite character is funny, you're probably going to want to walk out.  But check  urlLink the trailer  and if you enjoy it, I swear you'll love the film.

       The defining point of Fahrenheit 9-11 occurs when Michael Moore meets the film's poster-mother, Lila Lipscomb - the Michigan mom of a fallen soldier - in Washington D.C. On her way to see the White House, Lipscomb steps aside at a poster booth set up on the sidewalk... While the camera never lingers on the booth for long (why doesn't Moore want us to see it? -to use one of his own techniques), it appears to be the kind of conspiracy hut, common in DC and not unheard of elsewhere, where the names are changed to fit the times and particular argument but the pictures remain the same. As Lipscomb's attention pulls deeper into the booth (and, really, her own grievance) and mutters about President Bush killing her son, another woman steps in front of the camera flapping her arms and sqwuaking, 'This is all a set up... it's all staged.' Lila Lipscomb confronts this second woman to express the reality she is living, to which the woman allegedly responds, "You should blame Al Qaeda" - obviously, not even a factually correct statement.   And so, our middle-road Mid-America heroine, emotionally torn and confused, is stuck between two extremes: the first a paranoid distortion, the second a cold ignorance.   This is how it's been in the national debate. On the news networks, pundits are paired off like a dysfunctional Noah's ark to give "perspective" on cookie-cutter issues where the audience already knows what they're going to say. Pick your side because it's not the other side, they announce. The middleground is still the territory being fought over and is still where most politicians dwell, but the parties have learned it's a dangerous territory to wage the battle within.  urlLink So they don't . When you're standing right next to the dividing line, it's easy to lose people to the other side. But if you wage war from the extreme corners of the map, you can easily pull folks in to your purported safety; even better, they have a long run if they want to switch sides. So, the extremes have hijacked the debate and are tugging at the wheel for control of the country's direction.   Michael Moore yanks hard in  Fahrenheit 9-11 .   I have a few major issues with the phenomenon of the film, although I will not pretend to abhor every ounce of it.    First : Moore the Magician    If you can suspend your disbelief, maybe the first act of the movie will captivate you. When you see this movie (again), I encourage you to watch for the sleight of hand, though. You'll notice it.   Moore's narration (through humor and rhetorical question) is intended to guide your thought pattern while he takes the reasoned explanation and hides it in his hat. Same with the editing. Little is total fabrication; just as magic tricks are not performed thanks to mystical power, Moore's film relies (mostly) on entirely true bits of information. But pay attention to how Moore  needs  you to believe certain assertions laid carefully on top of those facts, though, or how he bends the timetable of events (dates occasionally appear on the screen, making it easier for a viewer to keep track). The whole trick will collapse in front of your eyes. Check out Dave Kopel's (a 2000 Nader endorser)  urlLink extensive write-up on the film  if you would prefer to have some of the method blatantly explained.   At other times, Moore constructs more elaborate devices; take, for instance, the recruiting of congressmen's children. No congressman has the actual right to sign their child up for the military (17-year-olds require parental  consent ). So, the exercise of having congressmen sign up their sons and daughters is guaranteed to get the results Moore is seeking. Considering this "failure" is bona fide, how pitiful are the actual results? Moore gets people to ignore him on their way to other things or to be - at least, pretend to be - thoughtful with his laughably outrageous documentation.   If Moore's case is really convincing, why does he feel the need to resort to parlor tricks and crafted illusions to express it?   Because that is what he is... A birthday party magician. Having discovered powerful footage outside of the public eye (particularly, the "7 Minutes" and Gore's silencing of the 2000 Election opponents), he  must  turn these pieces into props for his act, unable to let them stand for themselves. Somehow, the footage overcomes Moore's murky plot; in nearly every major review of the film, these are the highlighted moments.   The bottom-line: Moore might succeed as a comedian, but he's made a piss poor documentary out of blatant misdirections.    Second: Critics, Accolades and the Media    I find it shocking that given the extensive reporting of Moore's fibs, exaggerations and stagings in  Bowling for Columbine  that an overwhelming majority of critics so quickly garnished  Fahrenheit  with unrelenting praise. Alright, okay, so they might have relented long enough to say that the film was pretty one-sided. In fact, stories which critically analyzed Moore's construction and content have been labelled as "critiques" distinctly setting them apart from the salivary traditional reviews of the Justice League of Film Critics (JLFC). The craft is dead.   The following is addressed to the JLFC, although the rest of you may read:       Critics, you may think you can hedge your bets by saying something along the lines of, "It is worth seeing, debating and thinking about, regardless of your political allegiances." You are wrong.   To say that a hastily fabricated conspiracy plot is worth listening to simply because you are unsure of its legitimacy is to betray your readership and to cede your piece's entire point for existing.   Your purpose is to head poor arguments - whether in their construction or content - off at the pass. Don't tell me to do your job for you.   Next time, send your paycheck to someone who knows what they're talking about. Let them give us some actual criticism, because a claim that is blatantly untrue is not worth listening to, it is not worth thinking about, it is not worth debating. It is a waste of time.   P.S. When it comes to fueling debate on foreign policy, tell people to fucking pick up the newspaper you write for (or.. Hell. Turn to another section).     Needless to say, I also disagree strongly with this year's judges&nbsp;at Cannes.&nbsp; It seems to me, they were swept away in the emotional intensity surrounding  Fahrenheit 's premiere and were unable to objectively step aside and - like a good chunk of critics - do their job correctly.    Third: The True American Patriot &nbsp;   Something I've heard from&nbsp;a lot of people&nbsp;who liked&nbsp; Fahrenheit 9-11  is, "I agree with his goal, so I mostly enjoyed it." It's my opinion that we shouldn't endorse extremists simply because we see them being on our side. If we, conservative or liberal, simply smile quietly while the fringes spout ridiculous claims, we effectively disenfranchise ourselves.  One of Moore's recurring&nbsp;commentaries on the so-called "War on&nbsp;Terror" &nbsp; is that the United States funded/supported Osama bin Laden in order to oust Russia from Afghanistan.&nbsp; Whatever the validity of the claim, it is the criticism itself that I want to focus on here; that is, the U.S. tolerated extremists when such a course was favorable but now witnesses&nbsp;its brutal repercussions.&nbsp; See what I'm getting at?  Since 9-11, there has been a screwball cultural war over who is more patriotic: those who unfailingly support the government's actions or those who unfailingly question them.&nbsp; Of course, the middleground has been largely eliminated as we who are skeptically-faithful of any mixture have polarized ourselves - magnetically attracted to our sense of "team".&nbsp;  We  are largely to blame for disinformation wherever it comes from, because we are too tied to our partisan "patriotism" to challenge that which aids our greater efforts.  I recently came across this piece from George Orwell, which I think speaks strongly to this issue and with which I will conclude this response.&nbsp; Incidentally, Moore misfocuses  Fahrenheit 's quoting of Orwell and, in effect, misinterprets it.&nbsp; I hope to fair better with this on the inherency of dangerous nationalism:     The most one can say is that people can be fairly good prophets when their wishes are realizable. But a truly objective approach is almost impossible, because in one form or another almost everyone is a nationalist  ... The most intelligent people seem capable of holding schizophrenic beliefs, or disregarding plain facts, of evading serious questions with debating-society repartees, or swallowing baseless rumours and of looking on indifferently while history is falsified. All these mental vices spring ultimately from the nationalistic habit of mind, which is itself, I suppose, the product of fear and of the ghastly emptiness of machine civilization....     I believe that it is possible to be more objective than most of us are, but that it involves a moral effort. One cannot get away from one's own subjective feelings, but at least one can know what they are and make allowance for them      urlLink from the  Partisan Review , Winter 1945

       From  urlLink The Atlantic :   In early February I sat in a Starbucks in downtown Washington with Dan Feldman, who is helping to organize Senator John Kerry's foreign-policy team.   If you are going to mention where you met for your interview, you better damn well be sure it's an interesting location or, in the very least, has some relevance to your story.  The local Starbucks doesn't cut it.  Sorry.  This and the "light streamed through the window" are possibly the goofiest magazine writing cliches around.

       It's no secret that we've been bouncing around a Rock Criticism Dictionary for some time.  Allegedly, Andy has a pretty sizeable portion of it written and in a secret vault somewhere.  But what happens when math dorks try to dissect the puzzling language of pop music critics?   urlLink Pitchformula  is what.  A database analysis of the reviews on Pitchfork Media, Pitchformula is intended to discover the perfect song, at least when it's pitched to the Pitchforks.  Little is particularly startling, but it's funny to see a mathematical proof that the indie rock elite think "yelling" in a song is a bad move.

       Gregg Easterbrook, a brillant man first, a brillant writer second, and a man with liberal ideas third,  urlLink tears into Michael Moore  at the New Republic online.  The New Republic is a fairly left-wing publication, so I'm even happier to see the man torn down at a place where he expects to be revered.  The money lines?     "Canadian Bacon has a 20-second scene that presages the Michael Moore to come...at one point, a [U.S] commando falls and injures himself. The nearest other commando turns and, without hesitation, shoots his comrade repeatedly through the head. It's an ugly, sadistic scene totally out of place in what is otherwise a slapstick farce. Though it gets the message across: Michael Moore deeply, deeply hates the United States."   Also, the fine people at  urlLink Cox and Forkum  have a wonderul political cartoon today. If you're checking the link at a later date, this would be the cartoon from July 13.

        urlLink Ken Jennings  has been winning on Jeopardy since June 2 and is less than $80,000 away from a million.  Apparently, Jeopardy lifted its five-day limit for contestants at the beginning of this season (another guy had a 7 day run in January) and Jennings has been making the most of it.  If you remember the early run of  Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , it's my opinion that people were fascinated because of the show's ability to perpetually beat its contestants.   So, when that first million-dollar contestant used his final lifeline simply to announce to his father that he had beaten the machine, the show reached its unsurmountable apex.  Ken Jennings' Jeopardy run has the potential to rekindle the phenom of Jeopardy in a very similar yet fundamentally opposite way.  Here is a person the machine (and other people) simply cannot beat.  As remarkable as the success will be, the climax of this story is going to be his defeat.   That  is what we are watching for however much we respect/adore Jennings himself.  As such, his humble and human approach to his winnings (telling his wife the money would be going solely to DVDs, for instance) is probably the healthiest thing for him.  ...I may be renting  urlLink Quiz Show  this week.

       Will Ferrell just showed up and went crazy on CNBC's Power Lunch, not where I would expect him to be and - it seemed - not where the hosts of that particular show expected him to be.  He yelled a bit, threw a chair on a desk, and then pounded away at a tri-LCD-screen computer and screamed "This computer isn't real!"

       In case you didn't notice,  urlLink Michael Chabon  has a story credit for Spider-Man 2.  So, he's written a terrific novel about comic books, a pretty decent movie based on a comic book but has yet to write a good comic (this is where the link to the Pop Matters review of the comic book spin-off of Kavalier and Clay will go, but they're running sluggish today).

        Spiderman 2  is not the  urlLink best of a bad genre  (link from  urlLink Bookslut )...  I reserve that prize for  X-Men 2  (capturing the spirit of the serials without apologizing for being a big budget action flick) or  American Splendor  (a comic that transcends being a comic book, a movie that transcends being an adaptation).   S2  is manically disjointed and the series' characters have turned into caricatures of what they were in the first film.  Overall, the movie seems uncertain how it wants to spend its time when there are not collossal battles going on.   What makes  S2  better than the first and a pretty decent comic book film, then, is this: the villain.  Let's be honest... Most Spiderman villains are small-time.  Sure, they can do some real damage, but these guys aren't the devour-the-world, wipe-out-the-human-race, gruesomely-unstable types.  True, somebody has got to stop   urlLink Lizard  or  urlLink Rhino  and stop them quickly, but on a national or even global scale their potential to harm is low.  They are little buckets of rage, which makes for intense dueling with other superhumans and a few dozen homicides but no real danger to society as a whole.  They are the status quo of villainy - they punch really hard and are good at blowing things up.  There's nothing particular captivating about their method of destruction, they're just hell bent on it.  There are really only a few Spiderman villains you are interested in seeing in action: only one is human.  He is  urlLink Doctor Octopus .  Four bionic tendrils attached to his back reach, grab, suspend, crush and delicately manipulate in ways that a two-ton muscle man or a special suit on a hovering glider could not even attempt.  Sure, the real spider is Peter Parker, but when Otto Octavius sinisterly looms above another character he is as frightening as a prowling arachnid. The wild strands of chaos are spectacular when these cyborg arms claw and climb against the web-slinger.  Where Spidey's fights with the Green Goblin were like tennis, a concentrated volley of lethal strikes, his fights with the Doc Ock are like football, multiple fronts on each side attempting to outposition the opposition.  These scenes and this character mask the faults of the film so exceptionally well that you don't mind the fact that the rest of the movie has regressed.  Of course, the problem for the foreseeable future is that Sam Raimi will send us back to the lackluster world of the Green Goblin and astronaut John Jameson as Manwolf (maybe even Dr. Connors as Lizard?) before we get another not-dull, maybe even spectacular villain (in the form of Venom).

       A former Kindler has some thoughts on  urlLink  video games and addiction  in response to the  urlLink Everquest Daily Grind , a collection of anecdotes from the associates of Evercrack junkies where you can read stories like this:   "I've tried tricking myself into letting my own baggage about the game go, for instance by pretending to myself that he's a Ph.D. candidate, say, or a medical student who needs to study all the time and thus cannot fairly be expected to do his share of cooking, shopping, or cleaning. I find myself hoping against hope that I'm not simply being used (allowing myself to be used), and that our friendship is in fact one-sided and wonderfully convenient for him."   As I write in the GGA coments section, I recently read that video games release dopamine in the brain, inducing pleasure and concentration and also making games highly addicting.  With gaming's mainstream popularity rapidly growing, we are seeing more cases like those on EDG appear without the tag "he just really likes video games" alongside.  As much as those in the gaming culture want to protect the hobby, there are negative issues that may need addressing.

       Reporters across the city are visibly shocked and appalled that Chicago is not on the list of most recent probable targets for Al Qaeda.  You can almost hear the underlying stream of obscenities in their reports (vowels removed for the innocent), "Motherf*cking Newark?  New-*ss-f*cking-ark?  What the f*ck Al Qaeda?  We're the motherf*cking sh*t dispensers for commodities f*cking exchange!  You don't get your commodities sh*t lest you come to our f*cking door, b*tches."  Of course, the news has to remove more than the vowels.  So, the reports are desperate pleas for Al Qaeda to consider Chicago as a target but because of our awesome security measures to not-even-think-about-it.  A person should, when discovering they are not the targets of a deadly and largely indefensible suicide attack, say to themselves some brief praise to a deity of their choice and/or persuasion.  If they are a potential target, they might even avoid advertising to their enemies all the viable and important strategies and locations for such an attack.  But this is the "Second City".  Chicagoans take great pride in our place on the ladder of national socio-political influence, and if we can't even have that... well, there's gonna be hell to pay.  It's just a question of who's going to be paying.

       Finally got to play with some stuff that is long overdue.  -Snazzy New Design.  Really needed to pull the visual of the blog closer to where the site is going, so edited one of the blogger templates a bit for the desired effect.  -Snazzy New T-Shirt.  Right now, there's just a female version of  urlLink "The Comma Joke Ringer"  aka "Area Hippies...", the second in the Hippie series of RF shirts.  I hope to have a few more fun designs up by the end of the week; the Studs merchandise will be coming down.
