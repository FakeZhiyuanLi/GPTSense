       hmm..yup..so long never blog already..kind of miss it..recently got so fed up with melvin..when i heard what weiling had told me..he say if he cant woo the girl in 1 week..he would give up..and he say he waited for me for 3 months..yet he got nothing in return..what the..heard already..quite angry..luckily i did not choose him at all..so disappointed in him..finally show all his true colours..somemore say my chinese no good..damn him..think his chinese is damn great?..off he go man!..one day surely must quarrel with him..think his friend..that edwin..got back up people to help..think i scare?..i dont give a damn!..pity weiling..everyday also must hear melvin's scolding and nagging..what the..everyday also find things to scold her..very fun and nice issit?..he just totally pissed me off!..not because he did not want to wait for me anymore..but his actions and everything..make me so disappointed with him..just cant stand such a guy..think i very easy to woo..think he just fetch me home everyday..can get what he want..FAT HOPE!!..i will never want such a guy like him..[PS.whatever i write in my previous blog about melvin..i shall take back my words]..because it no longer affect me anymore...and i have finally seen his true colours..nah..lets not talk about him..it totally spolit my mood..back to school..so tiring..everyday got homework to do..sometimes got test..just hate it..hope i can sleep forever!!..LOl!..but that was surely impossible..just find that i cant trust guys anymore..because almost all of them are either flirt,bastard,jerk and son of a bitch..this guys totally turn me off!i hate guys who say what they love the girl forever and etc..not because i am jealous..just that i dont believe there is true love in this world!..if there is true love in this world..then why couples still break?..why do girls and guys be heartbroken?..maybe for other people's opinion..they think that love is forever...for me i dont think so..just simply hates FLIRTS!!..and hate those gals and guys who change gf/bf like changing clothes..they totally irritates me..and pissed me off..recently happy for my friend..hope that she can really forget about the guy whom she really like for the past 6 mths..ok..tats all..will try to update further..

      七里香 曲：周杰伦  词：方文山  编：钟兴民 窗外的麻雀 在电线杆上多嘴 你说这一句 很有夏天的感觉 手中的铅笔 在纸上来来回回 我用几行字形容你是我的谁   秋刀鱼 的滋味 猫跟你都想了解 初恋的香味就这样被我们寻回 那温暖 的阳光 像刚摘的鲜艳草莓 你说你舍不得吃掉这一种感觉  雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水 院子落叶 跟我的思念厚厚一迭 几句是非 也无法将我的热情冷却 你出现在我诗的每一页  雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水  我接着写 把永远爱你写进诗的结尾 你是我唯一想要的了解  那饱满 的稻穗 幸福了这个季节 而你的脸颊像田里熟透的蕃茄 你突然 对我说 七里香的名字很美 我此刻却只想亲吻你倔强的嘴  雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水 院子落叶 跟我的思念厚厚一叠 几句是非 也无法将我的热情冷却 你出现在我诗的每一页 整夜  我的爱溢出就像雨水 窗台蝴蝶 像诗里纷飞的美丽章节 我接着写 把永远爱你写进诗的结尾 你是我唯一想要的了解
