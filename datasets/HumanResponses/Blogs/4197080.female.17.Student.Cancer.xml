       The crisp fall air whisked slowly across my face as I sat on a bench outside of Cape Elizabeth High School. To my right sat my friends Bryan and Melissa clearly making plans for the upcoming weekend that did not include me. It was like I had disappeared.  "...And maybe after we go to the movies we could meet a couple of people at Angie’s and order a pizza or something," Bryan said as he pulled out his cell phone.  "I don’t know about that. Portland is always really busy on Friday nights and..." as Melissa responded, I got up and walked towards the football field where the school’s grounds keepers were lining it and cutting the grass in preparation for the game against Westbrook High. I figured that I would go since I had nothing else planned.  Turning to head back towards the school to catch my bus I saw Ethan Graham, captain of the football team, pull out of the parking lot in his bright red Honda. Ever since we moved to Cape Elizabeth I had had the biggest crush on him. We had never really talked much and we only had a couple of classes together but my gut told me that he was a really nice guy. The kind that would hold the door open and pull out your chair for you when you went out. I do not know what it was; the way he smiled, his eyes, his sense of humor. There was something about him that made time stop stand still when he entered a room. As he peeled out of the parking lot, I sighed and kept walking.  As I approached the areas where the busses were parked, my heart sank. Melissa and Bryan were climbing into the back of Leslie Strand’s car evidently had planned something with her for the evening. I silently shook my head and climbed the steps onto the bus. I then sat in the same seat that I sat in every day, slid my headphones on popped in my Something Corporate CD and contemplated what I would do when I got home.  After a twenty-minute ride I was dropped off less than one fourth of a mile from my home at seven Hidden Creek Drive. Considering what we had just gone through with the loss of my father and with my brother going to college, we had a pretty nice house. It was two stories with an in-ground pool, two-car garage, and wrap around porch. Upon entering the front door you stood in front of the stairway that led to the second level. To the left was a living room that had a large screened TV and overstuffed furniture. If you walked across the living room you entered the dining room. We rarely ever ate there and it was mainly a place for fancy occasions and for Mom to show off all of the porcelain figurines that she had collected over the years. If you continued to your right you entered our kitchen complete with breakfast counter and a small kitchen table. To the left off of the kitchen was a deck complete with a small bar and table that was excellent for reading during summer. Connected to the kitchen was a study area where Mom had her computer, fax machine and private phone line for work. Coming out of the study area and bearing left led you to the entrance of the garage and half a bathroom. This also brought you back to the front door of the house.  Upstairs and to the left was Mom’s room. She had a spacious bedroom, a bathroom fully equipped with a Jacuzzi bathtub, and a walk-in closet. To the right was my brother’s room, a spare room, my room and around the corner was my bathroom. My room was white with a day bed covered in pillows and blankets of white and blues, and a brown stained wood dresser and desk. Off of my room was what my Mother called the "playroom". Here I kept my computer, easel, and guitar. On one wall across from my TV was a love seat were I could lounge and watch movies or read with out being disturbed.  As I entered the house it produced absolutely no noise. It was just the way I liked it. Mom was at work and Jacob was at college in Dartmouth so I had it all to myself. Throwing my backpack onto the floor I fixed myself a snack and headed upstairs to the playroom. I settled into my computer chair and signed online so that I could check my E-mail. As usual, my mailbox was filled with junk mail and three E-mails from Dylan Cope.  Dylan Cope had had a huge crush on me since my freshman year at CEHS. I had never actually talked to him until earlier that fall and I did because I felt bad for him. I gave Dylan my numbers and E-mail address expecting that he would never try to contact me. Sure enough he called me that day, and the next day, and the day after that. I didn’t really mind at the beginning. He ended up calling me every day for nearly a month. We connected and I thought we were going to be really good friends until he started asking really bizarre questions like if there was a kinky side of me that I didn’t want to tell him about. He told me that he was good at giving massages and that I should go to his house so that he could show me. I was so weirded out that I started screening my calls and I changed my E-mail address but he managed to relocate it. I did my best to avoid him at school and tried dropping him hints that I wanted to be left alone. He had finally figured out that I wanted nothing to do with him in public but continued to E-mail me religiously everyday asking if I was busy that weekend or if he could call me.  I deleted all of the messages in my in-box and signed on to my instant messenger screen name  Melancholydreams  only to be interrupted by the phone ringing. The caller ID said that it was Dylan so I let the answering machine get it. Then I fiddled around online until I heard the doorbell ring. I shuffled down the stairs and slowly opened the door. Standing on the porch were two of my friends from school, Claudia Walcott and Lane Hass.  "Avie!" Claudia shouted as she extended her arms for a hug. I embraced both Claudia and Lane before inviting them inside and we all got comfy in the living room.  "So what are you guys doing here?" I asked as I turned on the stereo.  "You looked kind of blue in school so we thought that we would come over and cheer you up," Claudia said and that made me smile. Smiling, it does wonderful things for your soul. Up until Claudia and Laney showed up at my house that day I thought that I was going to face the evening alone.  "So what are you doing tonight?" Claudia asked as I placed a random CD in our CD player.  "I don’t know. I was thinking about going to the football game but I might just stay home, rent a movie and order a pizza."  "You should come to the game with us Ava," Lane said as Sarah Evans filled the air. I said sure and we decided to get something to eat before the game so we stopped a Subway for sandwiches. We picked up our food and parked in the school lot before we finally got to eat and the car was filled with the sound of crinkling wrappers and Brittany Spears’ ‘Toxic’ spilling from the radio. I finished my Chicken Caesar Wrap and began folding the paper wrapping.  "What’s that?" Claudia asked turning in her seat as she finished eating.  "It’s a Japanese Flapping Bird," I said as I finished.  "Oh it’s so cute."  "Yeah watch it flap it’s freaking wings!" Lane and Claudia burst out laughing as I simultaneously pulled the paper configuration’s head and tail causing the wings to rise and fall. Overcome with laughter, the three of us got out of the car, walked up to the gate and paid before entering our school’s miniature stadium. We sat in the middle of the bleachers near the fifty-yard line and as we watched both teams warm up the subject of boys floated into our conversation.  "Did you hear what Jimmy Spencer said today at lunch?" Claudia said as she adjusted her hooded sweatshirt. Yeah something about how all the girls in our class aren’t pretty enough for him and he can’t wait to get to college so that he can date real women." Lane replied with a disgusted look on her face as Claudia shook her head. She went on another tirade and I began to loose interest in what she had to say, turning my attention back to the field. Our defense was running through their usual warm ups as our quarterback, who just happened to be Ethan, was lobbing passes to one of the wide receivers.  "Aaavieee," Claudia said in her sing-song voice as she waved her hand in front of my face, "come back to earth and join us."  "I’m sorry," I said running a hand over my face. "I was spacing out again I guess."  "Ahh! Beast!" I heard someone scream behind me. We turned to see Bryan, Melissa, and Leslie coming down the bleacher stairs towards us. Melissa was screaming because Bryan was pulling her hair out of her already messy bun.  "Hey kids how’s it hanging?" Bryan asked. As the three of replied Melissa and Leslie sat down on the bench in front of us while Bryan made a point of sitting next to me.  "Ava-Jay you look sad," he said nudging me with his shoulder.  "I’m fine," I replied looking away from him and back to the field where the game was just kicking off.  "Why are you so sad?"  "You wouldn’t understand." He thought about it for a minute.  "Your probably right. I’m sorry." He gave me a quick hug and slid down a row to sit with Leslie and Melissa. If only I could have told him the truth about what was bothering me. I mean it’s bad when your friends don’t invite you to hang out with them, but it’s ten times worse when you’re too scared to tell them that it bothers you. We were drifting farther apart, almost like a sailboat drifting from the shore.  The game continued in the background with Westbrook scoring two touchdowns to our team’s one. Half time came and with it a lull in conversation. Claudia looked at Lane as if to ask a question with her eyes and Lane nodded.  "We’re going to head home," Claudia said to everyone before looking at me. "Ava are you coming with us?"  "No I think I’ll stay," I said shifting back to watch the game. I figured that after the game I would ask Leslie to bring me home. Our cheerleaders did their half time routine and the game continued. Many inside jokes and comments were exchanged among the trio in front of me that seemed to go in one of my ears and out of the other. I tried to focus on the game but was distracted by the large amounts of random thoughts running through my head.  By the end of the fourth quarter we had scored again and were tied with the other team. Ten seconds remained in the game and we had the ball. Both teams assembled at the line of scrimmage and Ethan called the play. The ball was hiked to Ethan who drop stepped as our receiver, Ben Ludlow, ran towards Westbrook’s end zone. Just as Ethan coiled to throw someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned around and there was the face of Dylan Cope a mere four inches a way from mine. I began to panic wondering how he knew where I was and how he found me at the game.  "Hey Ava," he said sitting next to me.  "Hi," was all I could muster.  "You look surprised to see me."  "Well I-" I squeaked as everyone around us jumped up and began cheering. I turned back to the game to see Ben standing in the end zone with his arms triumphantly raised over his head. We had won the game and I had missed the winning touch down.  "You were supposed to meet me at the front gate. Didn’t you get my message?" That’s when it hit me; the emails, the phone call, he wanted to go to the game with me and when I didn’t reply to what he had written me or returned his calls he had reasoned that I had simply forgotten to do so.  "Of course I did," I was a liar. "I got here early and waited by the gate for you but when you didn’t show up I decided to go in and I ended up sitting here with Claudia, Laney, Bryan, Melissa, and Leslie waiting for you to find me," liar, liar pants on fire.  "Oh. Well where are you going now?"  "Home," I replied as I quickly stood.  "Oh well I thought that we could hang out or something.""I can’t I have to get up early tomorrow because we’re going to visit my brother at college," I lied again.  "Then I guess I’ll see you at school on Monday."  "Bye," I said making sure that he was leaving. When I turned back around, Bryan, Melissa and Leslie were long gone. I couldn’t even see them inside of the gated area anymore. So I walked off of the bleachers, out of the gate and off school property preparing myself for at least an hour walk home....... to be continued
