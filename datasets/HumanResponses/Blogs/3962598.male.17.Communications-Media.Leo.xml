        mabuHay evEryone...        hapi fiezta...       itatag ang ekonomiya...       ipaglaban ang karapatan ng kalalakihan...       nwei...       This is my first time to have this blogger something. it was reffered to me by my best bargz, kuya Jasper (not KUYA anymore in JULY 26...hehe). Now I have realized all of the wasted time that I've never used to spend working on my own journal. I'm so damn lazy to write all that I would want to share on my self and to others, especially with the kind of personality and experiences I have. I almost had experienced all that a real living corporal body should feel and experience.       Maybe I should start with my firsts in UPLB...   sori to post this late... last july 14 pa ito e.... but i did not manage to post this agad becoz of some happeningz.... and i'm really not that interested by that time in making a blog because i may not meet the obligations (of myself to write anything) of this journ journ.... nwei enjoi all the summaries..... SUMMARIES.... because i always summarizes my whole week... wehehehehe....

      this was actually last last week...july 21 i guess..... monday and tuesday will be posted someday.... just remember that....  Wednesday..  wohOooo... it'z my reporting day speechcom... i'm really not that excited but... i just want this reporting to finish... i was supposed to woke up 7am to prepare for my speech... and a very short exam in philo... and my first clas was blockmeeting... but then i woke up quarter to 9...! ang i did not manage to review nor to prepare... but it was OK... I'm ready... all blue is the attire of the day... i surprised all of my listenerz on my report eventho i'm quite late... occulesics is my report... and started saying my introduction with my eyes focusing on something downfloor (i mean it's really not a GOOD START ) but it was really my plan... then after my intro i asked them if they had understood my info or they were distracted by the way i delivered it... hehehe... i foooled them! even my prof JC fernandez... (i'm still hoping she would give me a nice grade for my creativity on bringing my point to the highest level...duh?!)... in just a few minutes... i'm done without noticing i reported my topic in almost an hour...! what...? i did not notice that because i was really enjoying it... all the laughings and the crazy discussions i gave them... wihihihi... after that is my philo clas... EXAM..##@#@ and i haven't read anything about the material but then i take the risk to take the exam...(as if i have a choice) but i thought the quiz is all about the language something but it was not...! so i immediately grab a handout of my seatmate and started reading...tho icant understan some part of it.... thennn quiz time... i have lot of guesses and i got an UNBEL:IEVABLE 1...! guyz... naka-UNO ako...! UNO over TEN...@#@# harharhar... but at least i won't forget that STATE oF AFFAIRS: the answer that had gave me a point... after that my blockmate LAyla asked me to come with her and have my lunch at their dorm... serving me a couple of hotdogz... but then she soon changed her mind because she was really starving and cannot tolerate her hungry stomach anymore...! so we went to a resto.. katabi ng la ville... the food was OK... but not that satisfying as salad country...:) after that, hair iron time again... and next clas is hist2.. we just made our collage then away we go... ace and i attended the mass... and decided not to attend the ISKO ISKA meeting... we're baD... hehe so we have all the time to eat our dinner... a very long time to have a conversation... but not that long because ace has to review for her departmental exam for the following day... and while were walking through the cemented sidesteps path to the mendormz we coincidentally met BARGz... hehe we were talking about him at that very second... good thing he greeted us loud and we did not continue what we're about to say... zippppper! anyway she's with ate MIA... and a guy namED... (i forgoT..I'm so sorry i have Time elapsment when it comes to rememberring NAmes...) i asked ace to go to the review area of the dorm so i could teach her math11... she agreed but then after an hour she decided to review alone with her dormates who also happened to have a departmental the next day...also all my dormates on my Unit and WIng have departmental.... so i boringly sat on my deck and...............decided to review the exams of math11 (of my roomate) in preparations for NOTHING...! hehehe wirdo..#@#@ then i wrote a filipino essay for a contest... and wrote my journ for tuesday and sleep at 1:00Am...  THURSDAY...  as usual i woke up late but good thing ... my 1st clas was dismissed..! God is so goood.. but i'm stil late on my next clas because i fall asleep... hehehe... that was ENG2... we discussed about making an outline for our library research... tho we do not have any... we again approached her conversationally that's why we got her again... and ended up with a quite easy broad topic: JOSE RIZAL! wooohoa... i forgot where i'd taken my lunch... hehe.. ah yeah BK.. i surrendered a coupon for discounts but i failed to use it on my order... and ended up having a chicken teriyaki and even forgot to order extra rice... math building here i come... i met BARGZ again...(it's TTH) and he's telling me he won't attend his SPCM classs... (woW hoW coUld A univerSity Scolar do that...?##@#@) but he reallly did...! math 2 was so exciting... just as i thought i would really love this subject eventhough i always give out of coverage answers concerning about our english COMMARTS subjects... hehehe... our prof gave us an excersise and PERFECT is the score... whoa.. (i'm so sorry for giving such a reaction... it's really a complement for a cOMMarATS student to have a pERfect SCore in An excersise on the math building!!!) that's about true...false..true...false... i even have some stories to tell... the gurl at the back of my seat told me that i'm so white then lotti, the gurl beside her out of no where commented..." hmp ganyan naman yang mga mapuputi e.. yung MELANIN nila kulang sa VITAMIN D kaya pag naamaan ng UV RAYS yan madali mag kaka SKIN CANCER..!!!"... hwhaaat...? why is that so scientifically discussed? then i reacted..." hmp ganyan naman kayong MORENA yung SEBACIOUS GLAND niyo nagrerelease ng sobrang FATS kaya nagkaka OIL yung SKIN niyo which leads to blocked PORES and eventually PIMPLES!!!" hehehe... di ako patatalo... then everyone in my circle laughed...wehehehe... anyway PE1.... i met ACEnESS, CHESKA LULU, and ELAINEFUL... there's a happening in the BAKER hAll... the maneuvers were conducting a workshop... and too bad i have a clas... but i really don't want to try dancing those HARDDDDD BASICS...! my PE clas was just about the reporter's game for next week... and dissmiss..! ah before i would forgot BARGZ and I planned to attend the NAVZ fellowShip.. so we will be meeting ate KIM.. aohhwoa... after my PE clas i eventually went to mCDo because ACe told me so... the 3 of them were there reviewing for their departmental... while i'm there to continue my filipino essay(remember?)... but then we end up laughing and laughing... and soon enough...laughing... because of so many different thingz... but i still got a lot of ideas on my brainstorm for my eSSay... especially with my contentment on elaineful's answer on my question: BaGONG ISKOLAR NG BAYAN: ANO NGA BANG HALAGA MO?... you want to know her answer... "ahh..ewan.. bakit... kasalanan ba natin maging iskolar?" oh my goddd what d heCkkk!! we also met kuya JESS and sell us tickets for the southboarder concert for just about 110pesos..! originally that was 130... what a 20 pesos difference... hehhehe.. of course we did not buy..YET... sa monday na lang... we do not have the budget... alone, i went to st. therese and prayed for those who would take math11... then i realized hat i forgot to get my umbrella at mcdo... after the mass i saw ace, cheska and elaine... they were about to enter the math cave...there in the math buliding... nanggulo kami ng mga mageexam...i'm just trying to make them happy before they would take the depar... i got a lot of cheering stuffs ( hehe palibhasa walang departmental)... senseless interviews... funny discussions.. and nonsense reviews... afetr that i went on my dorm to sign on my late permit also for ACE... (what a FRiend!) then kuya JOMAR asked me to eat my dinner at the fortress (through txt of course).. so before going there... i fetched BARGZ at the Baker halll.. i saw him having his arnis stick damnfully hitting a pillar...!! and i waited there for an hour... but i enjoyed the stay because a lot of people were practicing some varsity acts.... quarter to 8, we went to the fortress... (ah by the way the fellowship was cancelled...) we met there arvin and his other friend ( guess what, i forgot the name again), kuya butch and some other people... barbeque pork chop... slightly not enough for us.. not until kuya JOmar came and he buy a caldereta blue bay tuna... i also came to see their rooms upstairs... asteeeeg ang gulo!! well... i get used to that kind of ambience... my room is also like that... wehehe... then we soon leave and i also decided to sleep at kuya jaspers flat... so check out time again... muntik nako di payagan ng guard... but when i told him that i got a late permit and the term paper allibis... he soon allowed me... YAhoeu... then we contacted EDZ (because kuya jasper wants her to be there... hmmmmmmm smelll something>??) then we went to blue box to buy an ice cream... a half gallon perhaps..!!! we almost had finished eating the whole ice cream... EDZ came... we were 4 eating the ice cream... later..... we were 4 who had eaten the ice crem...! wala na... naubos na... then we met ALONG(supremo) and PAUL having liquours in their bagz.... probably happening time again... nwei.. kuya joMAr let me "angkas" in his bike... because kuya jasper cannot do that with his bike... i think... or he just don't know how to... on kuya jasper's house.. we were 3... BARGZ slept on the lower deck...kuya jomar on the upper... and me on the chinese tiled mat with a matress beneath it... it was just OK.. but the thing is.. i got only 1 pillow and no kumot at all.. i was chilling... but it was really Ok... before we actually sleep we have different business... i was fixing my things and reading different handouts, books, exams,etc. of kuya jay while kuya jomar's using the computer...bargs was just doing something... goodnight..2am...  FRIDAY...  kuya jay woke up early... he has an early class... i'm next..8am...i immediately turned on the computer and typed my filipino essay tho it's not yet finished... i came to finished it just at that very minute... kuya jom woke up and prepare himself... he left... i'm still there... alone.. considering i still have classes at 10am... and i cannot take a bath there because i do not have an extra clothes nor a bath towel.. 9:15 i finished my work and went to the dorm... it was reallya long walk... from the pUTHO up to the dormm... hwow... what a feet..! i've reached the dorm 9 somthing... i immediately took a bath... and attended my 1st classs....LATE...! i did not see the next reporter after me... i just saw the 5th reporter(i'm the 3rd)... i entered the room with a lot of energy... hehe.. so my prof won't get mad... but before we leave my prof commented that i'm always 30 minutes late in her classs... and i told her no ma'am it was just 15 minutes... wala pa namang WANGWANG ah... my prof asked me what WANGWANG...? and i vocally delivered the WANG WANG sound...WAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaanGG... now she know what wang wang...! philo class... just a seatwork..dissmisssed... lunch with bargz, ace,izah and CAleb (joSh) at ROSEANNS (izah's foodstore)..(izah is my jock partner remember?).. i was late.. josh too. he told me he cannot come.. so it was just bargs, ace and me... the food is quite "kulang" in that newly opened foodstore..tho it's juz 30 pesos with rice, beverage (iced tea free from 23-30), and an ulam... then josh suddenly came up... but ace would eventually leave also bargz( magrereview pa siya for Micro101) so i'm alone with caleb... izah's sill not around... [ah by the way i was asked to change my air name because i have the same airname with another jock...REDD.....that was a couple of days ago] afetr we had finished eating our foods... we decided to leave tho izah hasn't showed up... i printed the essay i've written... 4 pages double spaced... then i saw MARCO.. the green guy.. he's looking for shapers store.... and it just happened that we're just in front of that store... he's looking for the official UP jearsey... but it was out of stock... anyway.. i went to the SU to pass my entry and i was like hipnotized to come in the USC rooM... i spent 3 hours there talking to different councils and people, and ACTIVISTS...! i fell asleep at the bean bag... but i'm actually waiting for the rain to stop because i do not have umbrella... the rain had stopped.... for a moment... so i decided to went to the lib and look for BArgz... but i was trapped at the lane accross the lib.... the rain started to pour that hard... waaahh... so i stayed at the OUR... and aince i was already there... i decided to get my ID but it wsn't issued yet... then i saw a friend also going to the lib... i hitched on her umbrella... yahooo i'm on the lib now... then i looked for bargz at the filipiniana section where he told me he would stay... but he was not there... then a guy with a bushy eyebrows approached me (hehehehe) it was him actually... and told me to go ROB and buy the necessary things for the mango float (baking?!@#@) hehe... he asked me to contact kuyajomZ para magpasama ako... but i i still have a meeting with the jock thing... izah came at the lib and we discussed the topic... a was also thinking of a good airname at that time... anything except RED... what..??? scarlet? (shakespeare...girlish!) vermillon?( it was actually good...VANILLA and VERMILLON) crimson? (ayaw ni izah!) bargz suggests ROUGE (moulin rouge, rustic rouge..) 50/50 chances on my likenesss... but it's very passionate... it's also red... in FRENCH nga lang... OK ROUGE... after the meeting 6:15pm..45min. before the airing... i went to the ROb... hehehe.. very risky huh...! then i bought a lot of snacks and stuffs for my one night celebration... the counter was piled with a lot of customers on cue... then i saw EDZ just on the counter so i immediately gave her my groceries and "pooof" i'm finished... 6:40 i'm on the road... and 6:45 DEVCOM building...! i'm on time... but the thing is i got a lot of groceries and it's really heavy... jock time!!!!! the flow was really turning out good... and we got 3 texterz.. and 1/3 of that is izah's blockmate... wehehehe... KAye also texted me and cheered me.. after the successful jock thing... it was a relief...! CALEB told me we were very organize and that was really oh-so-great..!~! thanxz cAleb....!!! after that i texted bargz hoping he would reply...i'm at the VEGA.. then at the BIOSKI...as i hand the 3 plastic bagz of my groceries... i saw his bike and waited there for a couple of minutes... i texted ace.. she's in the LuKE MIJARES concert pala in BAKeR haLL!!! woW... buti pa siya...!! then TABZ kept on texting me about my decision concerning bout joining the choir thing in tilamsik... honestly i really want to be a part of tilamsik but the rehearsals should be OK with my ISKO ISKA sched... and i really do not want to sing at all... what i really want is to act... just then the bioski seemed to empty at parang wala namang nag eexam... but bargz then appeared... caling my name... "Rand... kawawa ka naman" hehehe kse i was there sitting at the dark corner of a stair... then we planned to take the groceries first into their house and then dinner.. he let me use his dad's bike.. so we're a bit faster now because bothof us were in bikes... he told me we're going to meet kuya jOEy, his prof that gave him a 2.75 grade in ENG2 in UPMIN, his same prof in SPCM here in LB, and a friend, and the TILAMSIK DIRECTORrrr... wow heavy... his voice were heavy... and deep and hard... i finally met himm.. he also told me " now, i finally met you.." maybe bec. bargz is telling some stories about me to him... we soon transfered to jacks coffee shop... but kuya jaz and i had our dinner at the salad country... then we went to zara's internet shop... BONDING...?! and (ah before i would forgot... kuya Joey is also with a friend ,jaz's friend as well, Santy..~that was SANTIGO~) kuya jOey kept on telling us he's with 3 of the VAin persons in LB... and i was thinking if kuya jaY is VAin... what would you call me..?! why is vanity a big deal for some people?! (just remembering...our topic awhile ago for REaLITY CHECK was about survival kIt and i cannot separate it with the vanity KIt... so di kami magkasundo ni vanilla) we got out of the shop quarter to 12.. and i still have to pass the mendorms to fetch my things(my dirty clothes, acad things, and other stuffs) because i'll be staying again at baRGz flat...

      I'ts really not intentional when I came to start my blog after my first month in UPLb... It all started from a single day last June 14 2004. Everything seems to be fine. I woke up nearly 6 o clock in the morning bacause it's our orientation day I think... I wore a Red polo and a Black slacks with black leather shoes. everyone seemed to look at me because of my semi formal outfit at the  very start of the school day?! I thought it was so liberal in UPLB that no one would seems to care whatever you want wear... But I again thought and sighed... yeah they were all freshies... I mean we are all freshies and all of us were really adjusting to the situation and aculture shock is a natural feeling...! anyway... I wore that king of clothes because I were assigned to have a speech in the College of Forestry and Natural Resourses... If you would ask how... It ws really a very long story.................................... hehehe... after my speech everyone seemed to like it... maybe because of the punchlines I've gave them... Like including some star circle quest motto and starstruck motto on my speeches...( only those who believe in  the power of their dreams do survive.... starstruck!) wewewehwhwhwheehe...( dito sa UPlb, tagisan ng galing, labanan ng talino, lakasan ng loob, are you IN or OUT...?).....all of the panel of secretaries and administrative staffs congratulated me.. and i   felt  so prestigious... Wow this is my place...! as I take a seat i eventually slept in front in the po dium! and when a lady beside me approached I consciously got surprised...! (at nagkunwari akong nagababasa lang ng speech ko!) good thing she didin't notice.... I guesss..then I met someone named Patrick anthony and he thought that I was a upper classmen because of the way I  deliver my speech... what's with it??? he kept on including these oldies words: po... opo... ho... And I told him sarcastically... " hah...? anong po pareho lamang ho tayong freshman...!!! ano ka ba..?" we eventually  become friends... he is a forestry student...blah blah blah blah blah blah.....dami pa nangyari after that...next time ko na lang isusulat...I'll just concentrate on what had happened last thursday, friday, and saturday... the three specific days after a month of survival in the world of Oblation...  Thursday...  at filipino time... I'm late... a mean.. I consciously do that... because my prof is also always late... nahawa ako... duh..? is that communicable..? I'll be reporting something about the mArcoses... nothing interesting...at eng2... bored...at  lunch time... I happened to take my lunch alone because I'm on a budget and my seatmate who happened to be my TTH lunchtime companion is sick... luckily I've encountered the Koreans Guyzz (Richard, Arnold, and Jean)... hehehe.. they were exchange students there and eventually they will leave on july 24... we become friends too same with the Korean gals (Michelle Ha,  Janet Lee, Christine Soe.) I've met on the jeepney and had treated us on the isis cafe and liebestraum... AN Yong ha SEoH!!!math2... another bonding time with my bargz... we see each other every TTH at the math building.. good thing we doesn't wear the same shirts anymore  like we used to be.. i told him bout my "as IF" dream that his bike's rails get dislocate... [wednesday, just yesterday, we went to the Bioski building to look for my bargz jaz... but then we only saw his Bike... w0w hwhehehe (take the opportunity) i have a duplicate of his Key...! and so I bike... but then  with reasons i don't know the rails of the bike began to dislocate... and I'm at the midde of the road between NCAS and BIOSKI..! wow... I planned to fix it up but i failed so i decided to contact ace who is really with me before i drove the bike... we tour the bike on the same place we saw it.. and locked it again as if nothing happened... and then we decided to tour around the bioski while waiting for BARGZ... but after a few minutes we came back and the bike is no more there...! (what? ang bilis naman ni kuya Jaz magbike)... pity him nasira ko yung bike nya...! i felt so guilty by that time... baka hindi nya nagamit yung bike nya..]but he seems not to worry at all... and so i told him that I've used his bike and wrecked it... and told him that my hands got dirty... he laughed and told me that he had fixed it up immediately without even having his hands dirty...! what...? it was raining ang he doesn't have an unbrella... Itold him to borrow my umbrella but he refuse to... ( baHA la kA ngA jAn!) i'm so sad because i saw the results of my chapter exam.. I was really dissapointed by my score... 77%.. equivalent to 2! I acted as if i liked my score and I'm contented with it eventho I'm on the mud of sorrow because my other seatmates were all higher than me except the one who's beside me when I'm taking the test... we have the same score ( don't look at me cynically... I do not cheat...dis time!) and soon enough we adjourned... I saw my classmates gathering around our prof... it was about the corrections because some of the correct answers were not counted... then my mood eventually drive me with h0pes... yeahh... yesss.. I also have corrections... yahoo... i got 4 points additional... so look what I've got...85%... equivalent to 1.5! hehehe... la la la la la la...pe1... no classes so i decided to text Ace... my best friendliful mabuhay crazy friend..! (sino pa nga ba ang magsasama sama kundi kaming mga may tama....) anyway.. we have a meeting at the devcom dept. regarding our DJ stuffs... we were really excited because tONiGht is the moSt awaited... FReshman night..! we planned to check out and go to AIDLE's hauz to sleep over but AIDLE refused..... (sorry...) so after attending the mass on st. therese church ace and I have our dinner... we also bought our tattoo for the freshmen night... (wala lang!!!)... and then we saw ATE KIM.. my BARGZ love interest... but after talking to her... joking with her... seeing her simple but beautiful face... looking at her pinkish lips... and listening to her angelic voice... i think she's also my love interest... no wonder BARGZ like her so MUCH...! eventho she doesn't even appreciate kuya JAZ's kindness and goodness to her... but NO! ang kay juan ay kay juan...! kay BARGz lang sya...! ayoko mang agaw...! hehe.. dis is not a big deal after all... i eventually told BARGZ about that... and he seemed to e very interested... hehehe.. I even told hima bout what I've felt for ate KIm... and guess what he told me........ "OK LANG...:)" it was a joke Ok... but of course it was half meant....!party time...! freshmen night na...! grabe... I enjoyed all the lights and the smokes.. and the strip tease dancer... hehehe... hapiful talaga... i really danced all the way... and the camera is always on my focus because my moves were very noticeable... i go dirty dancing... with a lot of people of course... and as the night ended.... uwi na kami sa dowm... and that was 1:00am but in the dorm we still manage to have a small gathering on unit one.. inuman.. i drank 2 shots of emperador(how Cheap!) with a lot of fruit juices... then 3:00am sleep...  Friday...  july16 10 more days.... yahooo..!i only have ! class and I'm so damn happy about it...spcm... as usual i listen to my teacher's blahblah blahblah... and we have our 1st reporter 5 mins before class dismissal... what can you expect... "reporter continue till nextweeek...!!!" after that i follow BARGZ on a Computer shop near ellen's FC... that is where he introduces me to BLOG... and told me pinilit xa SumalI sa Org... at (naGPApiLIT namaN ciA...!!) poor BARGZ...(better read his ridiculous ramblings stuff in BLOGGER...) then i saw Josh matic... a joCk... oohhhhwow ... how can I forgot that I have a meeting with him...?!@#@# i have a lunch meeting with him... that's why i asked BARGZ to eat in the same resto... SPERK..! and biglaan... andun din si KAYe together with ate NINA..(kuya qUino's counterpart in terms of ----) so sa table nina KAyE si BARGZ kumain... I really regret the oppertunity to have lunch with my BARGZ at the same table...huhuhuhu... I have a lot of stories to tell pa naman... and so i and josh talked and joked so many stuffs while waiting for ACE... and when ACE appeared.. i eventually hide (that's what i normally do whenever she's around looking for me... because she has poor eyesight..!)... but surprisingly... may MATA NA SYA>...!! aaauuuhh... my hiding was uselesss... she already had her contact lenses.... I even go even a distant from her and show her my counting fingers and asks her..." siGE nGa... Ilan TO...???" at nasagot naman nya ng tama... HUbuhu.... our lunch had finished at quarter to 3....###@@#@ hehehe... ACe and KAYE have classs so bARGZ and I were leFT alone... we go to the SU building to look foR ATe Con and We succeded.... then i went on my meeting on ISKO ISKA... and saw INE would auditioned... I tried to stop her not only because I don't want her to experience the bad things ACE and I have experienced like extreme public humiliation... but also because I do not want to work with her anymore... she's very tactless and he had a wrong perception sa amin ni ACE... she also want to level our poularity but that wasn't the real score... she keeps on doing and attending whatever ACE and I were attending and blaming us if ever we do not inform her about something...! what...? she's from BAE pa... how could we ask her to travel from that specific place to UPLB juz to enjoy our social life....!!! maybe I'm bad.... because i don't understand her.. but that's life we get to be misunderstooD...! anyway back in my business... BARGz also has a meeting with GENESOC ( his soon to be Org...!#@#) that's 5pm... and i also have a meetin with my nervous jock partner, IZAH... so we accompany BARGS sa BIOSKI at doon na din kami gumawa ng scripts namin ni iZAh.. on one of the LABS... ( i'm really not fond of making scripts... but i have to bec. of IZAH)... to make my story fast... tititititititititieeeeeeeeeeeeetttt... it's 7pm.. jock time.... REALITY CHECK...! we were also very nervous and I received a lot of phone callss before the program cheering me up and asking me to greet them... BARGZ called me up to tell me he'll be listenign... tOuchEd...!!! we played a lot of songs including... the reason, this love, my immortal, everytime, and blah blah... after we jock... CALEb...(joSH) told us that we did very good,... (oooHHHH rili.. ano yun... consuello de bObO...?) but he told me that it's true,... after thet i accompanied IZAH in her Dorm in Raymundo.. then punta nako sa VeGA and BOOOOmmMm i diD not exPEct BARGZ coming... iTttxt ko Plang sya Ah... and so kain kami sa( i forgot the place...!hehehe).... then we texted ACE to go with US sa PALACASAN... kuya JOmar Is a finalist there so we really need to be there and cheer for him....
