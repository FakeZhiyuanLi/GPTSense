      Yeah, so it's official.&nbsp; Almost everyone is gone or about to be gone...&nbsp; So, so sad.&nbsp; Basically, I'm left with my boss, and 2 techs.&nbsp; Allegedly, we're hiring some people to come in to replace the gaping hole left in the Ritz lab, but there has been little to no movement on that front.&nbsp;  It seems that people stay about 2 years here and then move on to bigger and better things.&nbsp; Like medical school or grad school, etc.&nbsp; So apparently I have another year to go.&nbsp; Ah well. &nbsp; Also, this next year should be pretty interesting... We're starting a "Clinical Outcomes Project" that will track patients' entire clinical courses from diagnosis to... well, to the end, be that remission or death.&nbsp; I've spent the morning amending our big protocol to allow for us to get this project going.&nbsp; It's going to be a lot of work, methinks.&nbsp; But we will be hiring some other data managers, who I assume I'll be training and supervising, at least initially.&nbsp; Seems weird that I'll have help here... I'm almost used to having no back-up.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Blah, blah, blah... Have nothing really interesting to say, so I'll stop here.&nbsp; Will write more after some coffee...

      I need to amend my previous statement that claims I hate nothing more than looking for apartments... In fact, I hate living where I currently do quite a bit more.  My roommate and I live in a 24/7 construction zone.  We have crazy Nazi landlords that seem to find it acceptable to jackhammer our front walk at 7AM.  Somehow the $1600 we pay monthly doesn't include a liveable home...  For your viewing pleasure, here is a list of improvements to the building and some of the perpetual issues that we have at our home sweet home.  Keep in mind up front that we pay $1600 a month and NO UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED.  Yeah, fun.  1.   The landlords live above us!   And apparently they have a family of rhinos or elephants living there with them.   2.   The walls and floors are about as thin and insulated as saran wrap!   This translates into hearing them do everything, include breathe.  Also, the lack of insulation makes for rather chilly conditions in the wintertime... We pay upwards of $300 a month in heat just to keep the frostbite at bay.  The landlords pay LESS money a month in heat to heat their 2 floors above us.  So, yeah, we subsidize their heat.  Mmm bop. 3.   Steve is appartently deaf!   His booming obnoxious voice paired with the paper-thin walls and floors makes living there a bit like shacking up at Grand Central Station.  Also, despite the fact that he has a workshop in the garage, he insists on clunking around, hammering shit and shouting in the basement beneath our rooms. 4.   Parking!   There are 7 parking spots in our driveway, including the 2 in the garage.  Steve and Suzanne have 2 cars.  Kate and I have 2 cars.  2+2=4.  Using basic logic (math), one would assume that 7-4=3.  3 spots left.   However, the landlords NEVER park their cars in the garage, which is an eternal source of mystery and frustration.  Also, it's a huge issue with them if Kate or I ever have a friend over who parks in the driveway.  God forbid we would like to have someone over once in awhile.  5.   They are going to replace our heating system and install AC!   They claim this will take no longer than a day and will occur when we are not at home.  Given their track record of never completing any project in a reasonable time frame, I'm going to go out on a limb, and say that it will probably take a month.  Also, they're making this improvement for the new tenants who are coming in in September, so it won't benefit us in any way, shape, or form.  We just have the fun of putting up with workmen trapsing through our house while we're living there. 6.   They've decided to redo the front walk!   One would assume that this would be a fairly quick project.  They started the project well over a week ago.  And the bricks still have no been laid.  Oh, and did I mention the jackhammer at 7AM to break up the old concrete path?  Yeah.  Oh, and did I mention that we have no access in or out of the front of our building until the project is completed?  Yep. 7.   They're redoing the roof!   Last Thursday a giant black dumpster appeared in our driveway, placed strategically in a spot so that cars could not get in or out of the garage, renderinig 3 parking spaces unusable. Also, Suzanne informed me that Kate shouldn't park her car in her spot, as it was likely going to get pummeled by tiles flying off the roof.  Nevermind that parking is included in our rent.  We just can't use the spots that we pay for.  That certainly seems fair. 8.   Future improvements include painting the house!   This may not sound so bad, except that our shithole is made of vinyl siding.  Rather than replace the siding with clapboards, they have decided to simply paint the siding... Okay, except it hasn't been cleaned in, oh, I don't know, 50 or so years, and hence, they're going to use a high-powered blast cleaner on the building before they paint.  That should be an immensely pleasant sound to be awakened by at 7AM.  Well, those are the highlights...  Suddenly, living in a crack den doesn't seem so bad!  At least I'd be high as a kite...  In closing, Kate and I decided to help our landlords out, and wrote up an add for the paper, describing the apartment for potential tenants.  We think it sums it up nicely.  $ 2000 2 BR, IT HAS ALL 4 WALLS!! IT'S NOT CURRENTLY ON FIRE!!  ONLY MINOR LARVAE/MOTH INFESTATION!! HOMELESS PEOPLE ONLY SQUAT THERE  OCCASIONALLY !!  HEATING BILLS ONLY SOMETIMES ABOVE $1000!!  IT MAY HAVE BEEN INSULATED AT ONE POINT!!  WHITE PICKET FENCE AND PARKING FOR 2 CARS SOME OF THE TIME!!  LANDLORDS ON PREMISIS!!  IT'S A MUST-SEE!!!   PERFECT FOR MUTE, FRIENDLESS, INVISIBLE PERSON WITH MONEY TO BURN!!

      Yeah, so Joe and I poured over newspapers this morning... made a few calls... and, okay, is it just me or do realtors NEVER answer their phones?!?!?  All we did was leave messages... NOT FUN. My swank neighbor Paul has offered to show us an apartment in a building that he owns.... right down the street, which would be pretty HOTTTTT.  After seeing all the crap that I've seen thus far, I'm pretty much willing to sign a lease for something that has all 4 walls and is not currently on fire.  So, so sad...  I should know more by tomorrow... and I will stay irritated and bitchy until then... If this place doesn't work... well, I'd say I'd do something drastic, but I'll probably just pout and project all my negativity on those around me.    That seems fair.

      So I've been spending the past few days looking at dingy shithole apartments and have spent many weeks prior to this obsessing over the process of finding an apartment.  I think I have come to realize that I am either OCD, manic, clinically insane or perhaps a truly heinous combination of all three.  I can think of nothing that I enjoy less than looking for a place to live.  I do have the benefit of not being alone in this feeling, but the whole strength in numbers thing doesn't offer a whole hell of a lot of comfort.  I saw one apartment yesterday that actually looked like a crack den.  I pictured my boyfriend Joe and I sitting in our own feces and passing a crackpipe back and forth in our newspaper covered room and somehow the image just didn't quite fit.  Not for lack of trying, however.  It just kills me that one has to spend one's entire paycheck simply to have a roof over one's head.  We're looking at 2 apartments tomorrow, which will no doubt just make me more depressed and embittered, but this is the process, right?   My friend from work is actually in the same boat and earlier this week, she got got so defeated that she actually broke down in tears from stress.  I am now right there with her.  Granted, I have until 9/1 to find a place, but being that this is Boston, and we are soon to be overrun by a swarm of irritating students, the apartments will soon become a) frat-filled glorified bars and b) unavailable for courteous, well-intentioned tenants like myself.   Whatever...
