      Well, barring disaster in the next fifty minutes... I'd have to say that my first day producing the weekend all by my lonesome went very well indeed. Found lots of stories, and most importantly, lots of video to go with them. That was a problem I found with our last fulltime weekend producer, she was graphic dependent. I have one story in my ten that has only a fullscreen to go with it, and only one reader (ie, no video or graphics), which I really didn't need, but it made me laugh. Okay, gotta get back to the booth. I wonder if I can take this delicious coffee JP made back there with me.  Better not, that would def. be a disaster if I spilled.

      Bless me father for I have sinned...  I have a confession to make. For each of the last five novels I've read, about a chapter and a half in, I've flipped to the back and read the last chapter. I've never done that before, except for really boring books. But these weren't really boring books. In fact, all five were fun, compelling mysteries that kept me up late at night, even after I had read the ending. I don't know why I've become a ending-peaker. Maybe I've been reading too much lately.

          The LSU baseball team is heading home from Omaha... after being creamed by Miami and decimated by South Carolina.  I'm disapointed... but I can't say I'm suprised.  A few years ago we ruled at Omaha... we were sun gods. People, not just LSU fans, worshipped the ground the team walked on and turned out in force to see them play. Now we look like we won the Super Regional on a fluke, and our being at the CWS is a farce.  I guess there's always next year...

      You know it's a slow news day when the "cat stuck in a drain" update can whip people in this newsroom into a frenzy.  Ohh, close call -- out station manager just walked up behind me, just as I had pulled up google to find a cute cat to illustrate this post. Oh, well, not risking it anymore.  No pictures. I've got to get internet at my apartment...

      My parents had bad news for me last night. My cat.. Mr. Stubbs, the sweetest, orneriest cat ever, died Sunday. I cried.  Mr. Stubbs was 13-years-old and the most interesting, personable cat I had ever met. He was a stumpy-tailed Manx -- his tail was only about an inch long, but he used to wag that thing like it was a foot long. Katie, the dog, taught him how to beg and how to scratch at the door. Mr. Stubbs had no idea he was a cat. He was really the king of Sheba. And we treated him like it. He never had an empty bowl... god forbid it even had a hole in it from where he ate all the way to the bottom without stopping. He would start hollaring... no stopping til you went over to his bowl and shook it to even out the food. Such a sweet kittie... I miss him.

      10. Unpacking all my pictures and old cameras that have been boxed up for a year in my aunt's attic. 9. The fact that the girl I'm training to take my old job picks things up fast, so the past three days have been nice and relaxed at work. 8. Receiving the first two Buffy disks for season four and the second disk to the first season of Northern Exposure from Netflix. 7. Getting both my lamps out of my cool aunt's attic and setting them up in my apartment **LET THERE BE LIGHT** 6. Hearing the news that my dad got a new job. 5. Listening to Bonnie Raitt on repeat. 4. Eating both ice cream and a really kick-ass hamburger. 3. Having dinner with my parents, brother and sister-in-law last night. 2. Knowing that Leila is flying to Louisiana today. 1.

      Sitting on my right ring finger tonight is my grandmother's wedding ring (my father's mother). My cool aunt gave it to me this morning. My mom and I were there pulling my stuff out of the attic to move to my apartment (the last few things, thank goodness), and my cool aunt was showing us my great-grandmother's ring, which she had just found in a old jewelry box. So she pulled out MawMaw's ring and I tried it on. Since it fit (amazing that it fit me, since I have such big fingers.. but I guess that's who I got them from), my cool aunt told me to keep it. The ring is small, very thin, with seven small diamonds set in a row. The diamonds have sort of worn down so that it's not entirely clear that they're all there. I don't know when my grandparents got married, sometime in the early 40s is my best guess. My grandfather was 4F, so he stayed in the States for WWII, so really it could be anytime between 1939 and 1944, based on their ages and my eldest aunt's age.

      Great news... sort of. My dad got a real, full-time job. This one should stick. The sucky part? It's with the same company that let him go three years ago. But the rat-bastard who was in charge then is now gone and my mom tells me that the company has hired back most of the people the rat-bastard let go. They offered my dad his old job back a few months ago, but he turned them down. I have such mixed feelings. It took me ages before I could drive past the company's building here without being so angry at what they did to my dad, and now he's back working for them. At least they had to come crawling on their hands and knees to get him back. Hopefully he showed them something when he said no the first time. My dad is really hard to read, he's got a great poker face, so I'm not sure exactly what he thinks about the whole thing. We just don't talk about these kinds of things in my family. Anything that would make my parents seem weak, not omnipotent in the eyes of their children simply was never discussed. To this day I have no idea how much money my parents make. When I say we're upper middle class, I'm just guessing based on how we lived. I really don't know.

      I've developed a crush on the guy with the cutest butt in the newsroom. The guy with cute butt is one the sports guys, and the second he first walked in the door there was no doubt I would end up crushin' out on this guy. And cutebutt also turned out to be a really nice guy.     But I have to stop developing crushes on guys I work with... I've got to get out more. Did I mention he has a really great ass?

       urlLink   Okay, okay. I'm a sheep.  I've joined Blogspot. I was getting tired of livejournal. Maybe I'll actually update blogspot. Besides, my friends "in real life" (i.e. Portland Girl and New York Chick -- you can figure out who you are)have blogspot blogs and this will make it easier to keep up with them, as I am bad about checking their blogs regularly. I'm still without internet at my apartment, so we'll see how this goes.

      Yes, I did get to drive home all by my lonesome. I think my mom realized on the drive over (I drove most of the way) that I was perfectly capable of taking care of myself (and her car). Anway, I spent most of the week driving my mom and grandmother around. And there was much shopping and playing cards. The shopping was fun. I got a great blazer for $15 and a great denim skirt and linen shirt, among other things. My grandmother is doing pretty good. She was tired, but I think that was more from her trip back to Atlanta from Washington and the fact that she'd been away from two months than anything else. I'm tired now too. The problem with going to my grandmother's house is that it's not relaxing in the least bit. It seems I spend the whole time on edge, anticipating that Mimi may need a glass of wine or trying to get the clean dishes out of the dishwater before she does.  And simply being perfect all the time is tiring. I feel like I'm always "on," always on my best behavior, always having to be part of the conversation, which is not how I work. But I love my grandmother, I'd like to see her more, but my work schedule and the fact that she lives 9 hours away does not permit. Hopefully my mom will be able to talk her into coming to my parent's house at Thanksgiving and staying through Christmas. It would also make it easier with my brother's baby coming just before Christmas (speaking of, they find out gender on Wednesday). And speaking of again, I'm bummed, I just realized I'm going to end up working Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve I can handle (nothing fun starts til late anyway), but working Christmas Even sucks beyond all belief because I'm going to have to work Christmas too and not even get paid double time for it. I believe I've ranted about this before, so I'll stop now. 80 minutes before this workday is over.

      So I'm sitting here at work, just watching the time tick by, half watching this show on ABC, "The Days," which I gather is the&nbsp;adventures and hardships of a family named Day.&nbsp;Matthew just pointed out that the camera work is all jumpy and annoying -- I guess they're trying to capture the gritty side of being wealthy, living in the suburbs and going to private school. But that wasn't what was bugging me the most. I don't get why these two characters, obviously women in&nbsp;their late 30s, early 40s were dressed like they shop in the junior department at Sear's. But then a commercial for Sear's came on and answered all my questions.  Whoops, short post. Sheriff's PIO is on his way to the station with stories.

           I feel like a stalker or a reader of trashy tabloids in the supermarket checkout line, but I felt the need to pass this along. Apparently, Matthew McConaughey is spending his summer with friends in Zachary, just a few miles north of Baton Rouge. His puppy is being treated for cancer at the LSU Vet school (great oncology department).   I don't know what I'm going to do with this information (probably nothing), but I when I found out, I was rather appalled that I hadn't know. I don't know what I would have done with the information (probably nothing), but at least I could have been on the lookout for him. I know he's  nuts and plays bongos naked while stoned, but damn if he isn't really, really hot.      &nbsp;   -- above photo courtesy of the LSU Reveille, taken in Zacahary, LA, earlier this month.

      Woo Hoo, look at me, two posts in one day. I'm getting carried away, I think. No, the truth is that I've been at work since just after nine. My assignment editor is off today, so I came in early to make sure my reporter and photog got out the door and to answer the phone. But now I'm really tired and not 100% sure how I'm going to make it through the day. It's 11:14 a.m., and I need a nap. I really wish I had grabbed my book. I'm finally reading Artemis Fowl, which I had heard about forever. It's really amusing and a great, easy read (not surprising considering that it's a YA fiction).   I'm headed to Atlanta Monday with my mom to visit my grandmother. There was some confusion as to when my mom was actually going. Communication is not my family's strong suit. I knew mom and I were going to Atlanta Monday - Friday, but&nbsp;my brother&nbsp;thought mom was going with him next Saturday (he and his wife are leaving after they finish the BAR exam). So now we're trying to convince my mom to just stay in Atlanta and ride back with my brother and my sister-in-law. I would drive back on Friday (gotta work Saturday) by myself. My parents reaction to this suggestion.... "Our daughter, intelligent and talented as she is, will inevitably&nbsp;get lost." My reaction to that when Brother called my... "OH MY GOD.. THEY THINK I'LL GET LOST!!!!" The indignity, I tell you. This all happened last night, but it still makes me frustrated. How could I possibly get lost driving from Atlanta? It's all interstate and one of them deadends at the Gulf of Mexico.

      Why is it that clearing out old e-mails always refreshes me? It's like that feeling when you're hot and sweaty and finally get to pull your hair up into a ponytail. It's almost cathartic.  I put in my vacation requests for most of the rest of the year. Provided I don't get pulled in to work the Christmas holidays or New Year's Eve, I'll have three holiday comp days coming my way as well (since the holidays fall on my regular days off, I get to take them at another time). So right now, I'm taking off July 26 and 27th to go with my mom to Atlanta to see my grandmother; October 2nd and 3rd for the Georgia game (10 of us are renting what amounts to a tour bus to drive to Athens); the Saturday and Sunday after Thanksgiving to go to Kristen's wedding, and December 20th and 21st, so I'll have off the whole week before Christmas. Of course, I have to work Thanksgiving, the day after and Christmas and the day after, but I'll survive. I'm supposed to fit in a trip to see Portland Girl in there somewhere, but I'm not real sure where it's going to go right now. Hmm, I'll have to think about that.&nbsp; At least I should be good on&nbsp;geting a plane&nbsp;ticket, only a couple thousand miles away from a free trip. And I'm going to see Leila in two weeks anyway, when she's in town.   In other news, as soon as I get an internet connection hooked up in my apartment (I'm still working on it, considering getting DSL will require me to get a landline, but I may do it anyway), I'm going to work for my aunts, pulling court records off the internet. Have you ever wondered where credit reporting companies get their information about stuff like liens and bankruptcies? They get them from places like my aunts' company. Boring, but decent, easy to earn money. The rate is something like 40 cents a record. My mom (who also does this) says she can do a record every two minutes, so that's about $12 an hour and I'm sure I can do it faster than she can. So the job will easily pay for the internet connection, plus give me extra cash that is going to go into my vacation savings.

      Got a great big honking dose of reality this week at work, a little remimder of the chaotic uncertainity of the media business. One of our anchors was let ago, a shock to everyone, especially her.  On the same day, we announced two new newscasts -- one at 4 p.m. during the week and one at a yet to be announced time on weekend mornings to complement Good Morning America moving back into the weekends. I guess we'll need even more people than we already need to hire. Anyway, no one saw it coming that they would let Anchor go. I still don't have the reasons. Yes, we tanked in the last round of ratings, so News Director is ready to shake things up some more. I wonder how long it will take before all, or at least 90% of the staff are different from when I arrived. We've already had so many changes in the 13 months I've been here. I'll be very interested to see the ratings on the weekends. I personally think I've done better shows than the other guys have. I guess we'll see. I really can't wait until we get permanent anchors on the weekend. I know who one will be, and I'm excited about having him, but the other (co-anchors!!) is yet to named.  Damn, my movies are now officially late. Damn Exxon explosion. That's why I'm still at work. Of course, I brought my rentals in to work intending to go return them as soon as I got off work, but I've been here late monitoring the situation (my 13th hour at work). Anyway, the situation is clear now, and I'm going home.

          Hallelujah and Praise the Lord!!! Lindsey is back online... That's right folks, Lindsey has rejoined the 21st century and has an internet connection at home.  Of course it took two trips to Cox and an hour on the phone with two customer service guys to get it all hooked up... just because the new version zipped the drivers I needed and I didn't know that. For a while, I felt like doing this  . So you will be seeing me on AIM again, and hopefully there will be many frequent updates here.

      I was reminded today of that old (very bad) joke of the man sitting in a hospital waiting room, wringing his hands. A nurse asked him if he was okay, and he replied that he was nervous because his sister was having a baby and he didn't know if he was going to be an aunt or an uncle.  I already knew I was going to be an aunt, but I did find out that I'm going to have a nephew. The pictures from David and Stacie's sonogram turned out great. The detail is amazing. You can see the boy's spine and his individual fingers, and so many features of his face. The best is the one where he got fed up with the sonogram tool pressing down into him and threw a fit, arching his back and throwing his hands up. Before that he was just chilling, even had his legs crossed. David and Stacie threw a party to show everyone the pictures and share the baby's gender.  In the other news of the day.... a really sucky event. Some rat bastard broke into my car last night, breaking a window and stealing my cd player and my little book of cds. I doubt the bastard is a Bonnie Rait, Dixie Chicks or Beatles fan. Of course my insurance doesn't cover it, because I've got liability only, but thankfully my mom told me she'd pay to replace the window. It's depressing to drive around without music or even a clock. And the damn thing was stolen so soon after Leila fixed the clock. Rat Bastard!

      I hate people who give away the end of movies. I still hold a grudge against the guy in high school who told my the ending of "In or Out." His name was Blandon, with an L. What a stupid name (pretty sure that's the grudge talking there.) Anyway, today at work, KennyP said he'd seen "The Village" this weekend. I made sure he knew that I didn't want to hear anything about it. I mean, giving away the ending to an M. Night Shyamalan should be a criminally punishable offense. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I want to. So what did KennyP proceed to do? Teased me at every opportunity throughout the day about the movie and the ending. He didn't actually give away the movie, but still. It pissed me off. I can take teasing (at the very least I pout really well). But spoilers are a different story. KennyP already drives me insane, I don't tease him about his paranoia, though I could. Okay enough of that rant.
