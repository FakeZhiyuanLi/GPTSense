      The non-LDS make fun of the trademark Utah phrase, but sometimes it's really the only thing that truly describes the situations we find ourselves in.  They're not so bad that a good "hellfire and damnation" are necessary, but they're frightening and/or shocking enough to alarm even the most seasoned Boy Scout troop leader a.k.a. Mother of six with another on the way.  Today I found out that the fourth of my four bridesmaids (from four years ago) is pregnant.  At the same time as the other three.  That means that all of these beautiful women -- all of whom happened to be sealed for time and all eternity months after we were -- are all having babies before we are.  Oh my heck.  It ended up being a go on the macaroni casserole... thanks to the food storage and the one remaining can of tomato paste I thought I'd never be so thankful to see.  It was either that or brave Food 4 Less at 10:30am with all the moms and their kids who are now out of school for the summer.  Why don't Mormons do day camp?  I got criticized today by my blessed mother-in-law for going shopping at Banana Republic.  The first mistake was inviting her in the door, the second was that I had left the Banana bag in the hallway and she happened to nose around to find the tag on the shirt that read $68.  The third mistake -- I made a commitment to stop lying to my mother-in-law (and then actually prayed about it) so I admitted that I bought it three days ago rather than three years ago when Sweet Boy was employed and I had an allowance.  I've already lectured myself about the sin of waste and vanity so this warrants another Oh my heck!  By the way, Sweet Boy just smiled and said "It's a great shirt, baby, you deserve it!"  That, my friends, is what true eternal companionship is all about.  And now that I, too, am on the job hunt it's ok to want to look good for an interview.  I'm scheduled for one -- and the position is an assistant junior junior copy editor at a magazine.  Here's the real secret:  I've always wanted to work for a magazine.  My V.T. and my mother-in-law are already shivering in their empire waste dresses.

      Who among us having served in the R.S. hasn't had the unenviable task of trying to figure out exactly what lies in the depths of the closet?  Given that fishing out (and tossing out) a decade's worth of old homemaking posters and sample projects (glass grapes, anyone?), fishing tackle from a long forgotten Cub Scout expedition and assorted mismatched paper goods was how I spent my morning ... I could think of no better way to start my blog.  Well, that, and the fact that my husband is between jobs (computer engineering has always had its drawbacks), I forgot that my V.T. was coming over this morning so she had to leave the message taped to my screen door, and I'm supposed to be teaching Sunday's lesson immediately after hosting the Board meeting.    And despite the fact that I've been married for four years, I have yet to begin childbearing and the whole ward is whispering about my "fertility troubles."  Isn't it amazing that no one whispers "She hasn't seen her husband for five minutes altogether since 1999"?  So I call upon all of us happily married just-trying-to-keep-food-in-our-own-bellies Molly Mormons: Unite!  With that said I really have to come up with something better than the tried-and-true macaroni casserole to bring in for my most recent new mom.  Does anyone have a suggestion that doesn't scream "She walked over the plains last week carrying nothing but pasta, hamburger helper and a pan"?    Until tomorrow, my fellow pioneers...
