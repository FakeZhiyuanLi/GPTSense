      Idle mind gets bored with mundane routine Independent thought squashed  by endless media hyped up bull  Glossy images maintain false perceptions supersize billboards obscure reality politics relegated apathy festers

      Months passed by in my self-imposed sabbattical. And I thought I'd feel more whole, eventually. If I just gave it time, things would make more sense. Its so easy to ignore the self and live as a soulless being, operating the routines so that you function accordingly. But not letting anybody in. So much self doubt. That fear of letting anyone know how scared you are of being alone.  Because you are that strong warrior woman who is indestructable, who takes evrything in her stride and powers on. Fear is weakness. Emotion is weakness. And I am strong!

      You say that I'm a leftie. Well, maybe I am. If leftie means opposing unjust wars, speaking out for those who don't have a voice, questioning governments & tyrants,  looking for the truth in the media and not subscribing to bigotry ot oppression, then Yes, I am a leftie,  and I will keep fighting the oppressors of freedom.

      The world has shrunk and I am smaller. I'm sick of people selling their souls  to feed the gluttonous global demand. Consumerism, their God; Profit their prophet; America, the promised land.  Mohammed has spoken: Democracy is the wool pulled over our eyes.

      I feel used today. Gerry emailed me and told me to pick her up - does she think theat I am her fucking chauffeur service.  She doesn't know that I will be going soon - what the fuck will she do then? I don't think she really appreciates what I do for her.  The car will be useless to her without me - don't know why she doesnt get off her arse and get her drivers licence. Unless she gets another sucked in to help her with the slog & drive her around.    Sometimes I think that these Aussies have it too easy - everything given to them and they still complain. So she's daibetic - so what  - it deosnt mean that she's  an invailid - Simon deals just fine with his diabetes.  I think I am jsut tired of her shit - of her evading issues - I have spent the last 4 monbths with her anmd I am tired of wasting my time and money - I cousl have seen so much more of this country and spent more time with my family in Sydney. Yes, I did gain a few things - like learning to ride. But not half of what I was promised and what I flew halfway around the world for.

      I feel like my mind has been in 'sleep mode' for some time now. I don't know how long - weeks, months, it feels like an eternity since I've ignite any creative spark. So I sat down to write some stuff today and  it all just spewed out - words, ideas, poems all jumbled up - trying to some out all at once, and becoming some sort of dribbling gibberish in the process. Check out "Spewing verse" blog for some of that shit.  The craziness is here. Exploding - my mind is racing at warp-speed and I'm not on any drugs. I just need a form of expression. Or maybe I just need a cigarette & a glass of wine (I'm in the process of quitting the fags), Then again, maybe I just need a good fuck. There has to be more. So what is the meaning of life?

      I know its only a cold, but I feel like death. Aching body, aching head, sandpapery throat, burning chest. Probably after-effects of my great weekend. Went out to see Salmonella Dub at Prince of Wales on Friday. They were awesome. The crowd was pretty funky, very Kiwi though. Strange that the Aussies were in minority in St Kilda. We orgainsed some pills so the whole gang was pretty happy most of the night!

      So its just past midnite and I'm munching cold pizza and washing it down with a good cab sav. It's been a good day! Well, it started off ok and just got better. Went out to the horses - the weather started off fine - blue skies which quickly turned ominous as it often does in Melbourne. Ah, Melbourne- where the weather is as changeable as a woman's moods! Anyways, as I said the blue skies turned grey and pretty quickly it was full blown storm - just as we were harnessing up the horses to go for a drive. The poors nags got drenched, but I had my new waterproof that kept me dry, but also made me feel like a Jedi knight. John commented that I looked like coat with feet! Driving home, I noticed the full moon in th twilight. It was stunning and just lifted my mood. The moon always seems to cast its magic spell on me.  Yeah well I got home, had a steaming shower and my day improved. Was hungry so nibbled on some leftover pasta, then my housemate, Tara offered to make nachos for dinner - they were good smothered in fiery habenero sauce and cooled off woth guacamole & sour cream! Simon was stoned as usual and we had a bit of a political debate about the army and teaching kids about "diffrent famlaies" - i.e. gay parents etc. Tara and I sort of forced our liberal opinions on Simons more conservative view. Simon had ordered pizza and no-one answered the door when the buzzer rang, cos no-one ever rings our buzzer. The poor pizza guy thought he had the wrong address!  It got better ....Jayne got home while Simon and I were watching the Young Guns video (I haven't watched this in years, but enjoyed it - you can't go too wrong with a Billy the Kid western). So Jayne was upset when she got home she grabbed one of Simon's smokes and headed outside for a fag. (Jayne and I quit smoking on Monday!) I went out to check on her. She was crying. I figured that it had to be about Chris. Jayne has been unofficially saeeing Chris for 2 years. Chris has a girlfriend that he has no intention of leaving. He's also 12 years older than her - so in the long run she is just going to get hurt as she has been in the short term. But who am I to criticise? - so I just don't. Jayne pisses me off sometimes. In a way I envy what she has with Chris, and in many more ways I don't. At least its soemthing - better than fucking nothing. I think I'm the kind of person who just won't give anyone the opportunity to hurt me (I'll hurt them first!), which also means that I don't give anyone the chance to love me.  Jayne wanted to take a drive to the beach - and me being the good friend-spontaneous-fun-crazy chick that I am, I offered to drive. I'm always in the mood for a bit of an adventure. We headed off to Port Melbourne and picked up a bottle of red wine en route, only to discover that we had no way of opening the bottle. Being resourceful girls we eventually pushed in the cork using a key. So we get to Port Melbourne and it is freezing. Jumped over a wall to get to the beach, stretched a few muscles in the process. The mini-wavelets lapped onto the beach... another thing that pisses me off about Melbourne - its in a bay, so the waves don't feel real. Its just one big salty lake! We sat on the rocks sipping wine and taking pics of ourselves as hobos taking swigs of wine out of a paper bag. The gorgeous full moon peeked out from the clouds - it just made me feel lonely.   Having had enough of the cold, we popped in at Jayne's sister, Kate's house in Port Melbourne, our intention being to steal some lemons from the garden. While riding Cub last week, I stole a lemon form a strangers garden and it was the sweetest lemon ever (as far as lemons can be sweet), so I made a pact that I will never buy another lemon again as the best lemons are always the stolen ones! Kate was up, so we ended up chatting for a while, and out lemon-stealing escapade wasn't quite as naughty as we had hoped it would be!  On our way home, Jayne spotted the sofa that has been left out on the corner 2 blocks away from home. We have been eyeing out this sofa for the last week - its a cool couch - missing cushions but its one of those sleeper couches that doubles up as a trampoline! It would be great on our back porch - how many people have a lime green sofa which is also a trampoline and sleeper couch in their back yard! So I stopped the car, put the hazard lights on, whilst Jayne & I proceeded to load the sofa into the back of the ute. Half of it stuck out and I had to drive over the speed humps really slowly so the sofa wouldn't fall out!   We got home, off-loaded the sofa into our driveway, had a little jump on the trampline, poured myself a glass of wine - much better than swigging out of the bottle! Jayne spent half an hour on the phone with Chris, then he came to pick her up for a drive - my guess is that they're getting off in a parking lot somewhere. And I sat down to write this account of my day.  Shit, the wine is finished, a sign that its time to hit the sack. G'nite Mr Moon!

      I watched Donnie Darko again the other night,and again it fucked with my head.  THe problem with Donnie Darko is that I get the themesong stuck in my head for days afterwards! I sang GAry Jules' MAd World to myslef a few hundred time yesterday - it even played like a stuck record while I slept.  I love that song - it makes me want to smile & cry at the same time, but once it gets in me, it takes over.

      post no 2! - I am making progress!  Its 9am, too early, I've only had one coffee and my back hurts like hell. Ok, thats enough wingeing from me. Its just that I feel the need to feel sorry for myslef sometimes cos no-one else take pity on me. Guess thats one of the disadvantages of being so far away from home - there's no-one to mother me, and no-one to have a decent bitch to. Well, thats what the blog is here for - gives me my opportunity to have a good bitch. Its too early for that now - maybe later today after a few more hours of horse-riding and more excruciating backpain.

      This being my first blog, and being a newcomer to blogdom, I thought I might as well just get down and do the dirty deed... As these words are being typed I am slowly (and maybe painfully to anyone reading this) losing my bloginity! I have always wanted to write, so I figured  blogging would be a good place to start, but now that I've actually started I still don't know where to start - at the beginning, the end, or just all cut up in a Pulp Fiction sort of way.  Maybe I should just rant at all the things that piss me off, but there are just too damn many things that piss me off, which brings me back to the question - where the fuck should I start?  The obvious starting point, a little about me - I'm 24 year old South African woman* and don't know what I'm doing with  my life. After 5 years at uni, I was earned a degree and some postgrad courses in finance (its not as boring as it sounds - I had dreams of being a glamourous fund manager) and spent the subsequent 2 years learning to suck ass in order to climb the corporate ladder. Unfortunately ass-kissing was not my forte. In November 2003, I quit work with the noble idea of travelling the world for a year or three  until I figured myslef out a little more. Independent travel (I liked the sound of that - way more adventurous that investment banking). I spent an awesome 2 months backpacking through Malawi and Mozambique, and I'm currently in Australia.   *It was difficult deciding to use "woman" here. The word "woman" envokes feelings of confidence and strength, feminist but not dykish; as opposed to 1) "chic" - not feminist enough; 2) "female" - too techincal - refers to anatomical characteristics; 3) "lady" - too Brit royal, too stuck up 4) "person" - too PC; 5) "bitch" - animal related, too unPC;  The people who write dictionaries (the nerds at Oxford or Websters) need to come up with a PC word for a modern young woman which is not too technical, too girly or too feminist - a useable word that is all-encompassing yet not stereotyping. (hmmmm, maybe thats a contradcition?) I feel that it is important for me to embrace my gender without patronsing it.   Ok, the virginity lost, and all resistance crumbles. I may as well start with how my day went. I went horse-riding today... trotted Cub in the roundyard for a hour today, after doing 2 hours heavy work with him yesterday. (Cub is a 6yo gelding, a big clydie-cross who shys at everything) I am not fit enough for this - my back is fucked! I think its the bloody saddle I'm using - the seat is too hard - my ass needs more cushioning as shock absortbtion - Gerri says I should get strap some padding onto my ass - I say she needs to invest in a new saddle.    So, why am I busting my balls working horses that aren't mine everyday? Now I know that technically I don't have any balls, but balls sounds so much better! I could say breasts instead of balls considering the way they bounce while I'm on a trot (Note to self: buy extra-support sports bra) , but I think that 'back' is more appropriate because it defintely feels like its busted. Its a long story - but I volunteered for a fundraising project that would give me the chance to travel up the east coast of Australia in a horse-drawn gypsy wagon raising funds for diabetes. Sounds like an adventure - thats what I thought at the time. Basically,  I travelled halfway across the world to pick up horse-shit! I've been in Melbourne 4 months and I am not much closer to leaving on the gypsy trip that when I got here.  Though mMy previously non-existent equestrian skills have improved so much that when I return home I could always consider a career as a groom or stable-hand!  Its 1am, and I have another hectic day with the horses tomorrow. Its time to say Goodnite!  I did it - logged my first blog! The dirt deed has been completed, my virginity lost to the megabytes of cybershit that squat in the code of faraway servers.
