      I did the remarkeable yesterday. I watched 10 solid hours of Season Two of "24" and... JAKKU BAWAAAAAA!!!  I had to finish the season before I went out. Oh, what you must be thinking of me now...  You know, when you watch any tv show or movie that is set in tv/movie-time, you get to see small bits of the characters here and there; just enough to make you dislike some and sympathize with others. ...But when you follow them every second of their lives, even for a 24-hour period, you come to know a whole new level of hate. Sheri Palmer is such a bitch, if she were a real person I would    .   JAKKU BAWAAAAA!!  M

      Everyone in Japan has a cellphone...well almost everyone. It's not that big a deal.  Sure, they're cool and all. I've got a 65,000 color, 1.3 megapixel camera on mine...but even the new models with TVs and what not don't make me freak out like they used to.  ...and then this completely blew my mind:  The new  urlLink Sanyo TS-41 from Tu-Ka  (Japanese cell phone company, sorry, website is in Japanese) with the SonicSpeaker feature that let's you talk AND listen with the bones in your face.  Just press the SonicSpeaker pad up to your cheekbone and your entire head fills up with conversation.  They developed this so people can communicate in loud, crowded, noisy places...what an incredible world we live in.

      Okay, here's a little insight into the twisted Japanese mind.  Notice anything about this  urlLink Anabuki Construction Office commercial  that seems a bit wrong? Maybe a bit too R-rated for the little girl?  Hint: Tanuki, (Japanese for "racoon dog"), are usually portrayed in statue and painting form with considerable emphasis on the nether-area.

      Shelves are where it's at!  I recently moved apartments, and have since been decorating to the hilt with modern furniture, super chic nic-nacs (how do you spell that?) and a killer lighting scheme.  But something was always missing.  Until yesterday.  I installed some homemade shelves and now everything is different.  Like a 1x6x30 inch piece of wood at chest height in my kitchen/living room area.  Can somebody say Mini Bar!?  It adds a whole new dimension to the room...flat, horizontal surfaces, that's the way to go!  Sure, I'm turning a bit too Martha here, but hey, she's looking at 10-20 behind vertical bars so somebody has to take her place...  Mike

      Biking in Japan is a constant flirt with death, and it is almost provable.  There is the "personal gravity postulate", whereby if you approach another biker (or pedestrian) on bike, and give them considerable berth, they will 4 times out of 5 veer directly into your path.  It is uncanny, really.  Then there's the "students-in-horizontal-tandem formation", 2-4 uniformed chitlins riding side-by-side, taking up the whole sidewalk and clotheslining anything that gets in their way.  And here's a funny situation. Funny, in that laughing-at-a-dead-clown kind of way.  It's raining out, I'm biking along a sidewalk dodging trees and electrical poles tleft and right.  (Kind of like a sapien version of Frogger.)  About 20 yards ahead of me approaches a young woman on bike with a small child in the front basket AND one more in the back.  Another child of hers is biking alongside her.  They see me coming, so the woman moves off to the side, but her bike slips, and in trying to keep her two kids from flying off, proceeds to pin her solitary kid into the bushes.  He's on the verge of tears by the time I bike by.  Now I'm thinking, was that my fault? Should I say something? Sure, I was way off in the distance when this happened, but it DID happen because she was trying to get out of my way...by the time I concluded it wasn't my fault I was already half-way home, but I did feel bad.  And her poor kid, crushed by his mother and her bike...I hope he's not hurt too bad.  M

      If you've ever taken an "O-Chem" class then  urlLink this  might just send you over the top.  All those dreadful years in Uni...this was my bread and butter for 4 years in college.  But thanks to Musical Chemistry I can look back at the cyclic pathos that surrounded my day-to-day and laugh uncontrollably!  This, good people, is how chemistry should be taught!

      Ever Google Yourself?  Okay, if by ANY chance you may have at some point went to Yahoo.com or Google.com and did a search for: "michael barry blog" I have something I want to say to you...  Yup, MY middle initial is "G', but I don't collect postcards and I don't live in Ireland. STOP EVERYTHING!  urlLink TOTALLY _NOT_ ME !  Oh, and I'm not the  urlLink Canadian "cyclist"  or the  urlLink Pooka Stew guy .  (Oh! That's just creepy!!!!)  And I'm NOT ANY of  urlLink the guys listed on IMDB.com .  This scared the hell out of me a few years ago when a "Michael Barry", "from Colorado" and around my age surfaced on the Internet with a homepage dedicated to his obsession with CATS! The animal, not the play. A shitty webpage full of pictures of cats and poems about cats....that was definitely NOT ME, and I worry that people I once knew may have happened on that page and put 2 and 2 together...and decided Mike Barry had gone off the deep end!  It's a shame, all these Michael Barrys taking over the web! Yeah, it's a great name, but you can't blame me for being a little jealous that these guys are capitalizing on it...  Oi.

       urlLink One less asshole in the world.   But this is a bit different than what I heard.  Whether or not the mobster shot himself in head...I don't know, but the news here is saying that they took him to the hospital and he died there.  Should have let him rot on the ground.  And why does it have Tokyo written at the start of the article.  Give some props to Tochigi!  I swear this place wouldn't exist if I didn't push it like I do.  There wasn't a single second of this whole thing mentioned on any US news website, even in their ASIA section! But sure, there was a whole article on Delta airlines giving away free tickets.  And the one about the gorilla that died! Get with the times, people! I'm normally cool with all forms of ape and sapien-like beast, but fuck the gorilla! Who in the world is deciding that a dead gorilla is more newsworthy than a 44 hour police/yakuza standoff?  These are the times we live in...

      The guy's still up there. I couldn't bike anywhere near the area this morning on my way to work. Last time he did this they arrested him after 21 hours. It's been almost 25 now. Oh, and he's got two girls in there as well, both of them his girlfriends!...(I think). And here I am, single as a binary digit.  This guy must have a wicked sense of humor and be very keen on that romance thing...

      This is exciting! There's a mobster holed up in his girlfriend's apartment only TWO BLOCKS from my place. This morning at 9:30 detectives with a warrant tried to enter his place and he fired a pistola at them! So, now the entire area is swarming with cops and TV crews. I had to go home in a roundabout way because all my neighborhood streets are blocked off. This Yakuza nut has got a machine gun and apparently he's threatening to blow something up as well. Oh, and this is the same genius who was arrested in 1991 (again in Utsunomiya) for yet ANOTHER standoff.  It really confuses me how some people, who I am told share in the same genetic code, can be SO INCREDIBLY STUPID! How is it they ever made it out of the womb? Blows my mind. Well, we'll see where this one goes, but I tell you, he's fucked either way! And I'm quite happy about that. M

      I don't know whether or not these sources are legit, but the  urlLink article  is pretty convincing...I guess it's just another reason meat is simply unavoidable.  So, to all you soap-box vegetarians and vegans out there cursing our meat-eating ways, just ignore that look of orgasmic gratification on our faces...Oh, and by the way, if your balls shrivel up to nothing or your babies all develop multiple sex organs, or their bodies have the consistency of pectin, just remember that we meat eaters will keep the ever-forgiving Wendy's Drive-Thru window open til 10pm, just for you.  Meat! M  I like this one: "I'm not a vegetarian because I love animals, I'm a vegetarian because I hate plants."

      Oi, work... Have pushed aside the all-too important sister-city agreement translation for a few hours of Internet surfing to calm the blood.  Just came across one of my  urlLink favorite poems . I have been looking for an English translation for ages and always thought it didn't exist.  In the movie Mindwalk, John Heard's poet character recites this at the end, and I always thought it was wicked cool. It's also a really wicked cool movie! Sure makes you think. M

      SUNDAY- Wasted the whole day watching movies. Oh, and since it was raining I thought I'd relive me youth and play in the mud.  I went outside to my mini garden and dug up 2 garbage bags full of weeds, relocated half a cubic meter of rock, and moved about 2 1/2 cups worth of Giger-esque insects...now I have a long L-shaped strip of mud surrounding my apartment.  Later that afternoon Sandstrom gave me a lift to Viva Home (kind of like a Home Depot) where I bought 20 sq. meters of pre-cut, short blade grass, and a peach tree.  Got home and in the rain by twilight I laid the sod and earthed Yvette. Yvette is my peach tree. Let's hope she grows tall and bears lucious fruit.  M

      Shit my head hurts! Rolled in at almost 4am. Ended up walking home, took me 40 minutes, all the way from the East Side. My world is throbbing.  I spent 17,000 yen (US$150.00) last night for Mike Sandstrom's bachelor party.  The guy's having his wedding ceremony in Hawaii next weekend and so we figured we'd go all out and have a Guy's Night.  There were 5 of us, 3 "Mike"'s a "Will" and a "Joe"...all was chill until...we decided to go to a HOSTESS CLUB! (Hostess Club OR Russian Strip Club, either would have been alright. We tried the cheap cheap Philipino club but it was full of old married men.)  So we bought a beer To-Go and merrily marched our way to the red-light district where Ali, the totally X-rated, (but with a wicked good heart),Iranian kebab guy recommended "Bigou", a not-too-well-known, basement-level Taiwanese/Chinese hostess club. $70 for all you can drink, no time limit and your very own imported chick...and no, we're not talking sex...that costs extra.  Shit, my girl was terrible. She was boring, couldn't speak Japanese to save her life; she obviously didn't want to be there. Just brought the whole conversation down. I was trying to talk about anything to get her interested, like her goals, her future dreams, her family, her country...nothing. Totally destroyed the excitement factor.  Easiest yuan she ever made.  I have half a mind to write a letter to the manager...  She fed me pineapple tho. But even still, it was a big waste of money.  And to add insult to injury, there were some truly nappy women there, the kind where you could tell they haven't washed since the 50's.  So one of the hags came up to me about two hours into our stint and asked me if I'd like to buy some of her "special homemade pickles".  Fuck me, I didn't want to inquire further! I said hell no and we left.  Wasn't all bad, tho. Sandstrom liked his girl. I think the rest of us were a bit jealous.  Hey, it was a guy's night out!  Here's a good word: " mizu shoubai " (lit. the water industry)= the bar/restaurant trade (but meaning those seedy bars, strip clubs, that sort of thing). So a "hostess" would be " mizu-shoubai no onna ".

      Okay, about time I started up a blog of me own.  Japanese weather forecasters are for shit. Apparently the weather is updated every 30 minutes on my cel phone. It says there's a 0% chance of rain, and yet I'm looking outside at old ladies being dragged away by that new river that just started raging through downtown...rain, pouring down, thunder and lightning crashing drumming all around. And there's the little picture of a sun on my cel saying "Hot and Sunny"!   I'm taking a few hours off work. This morning I gave a lecture on International Relations to 190 septuagenarians who were all coughing. But they loved me, as most old people do. I guess I remind them of the good old days of shogun and samurai and dirt roads and horse-drawn carriage. M

      It is with a sense of gasping awe and cynicism that I find myself fascinated with the extremes to which my fellow humans will go in life, and to equally incomprehensible purpose. That, and my constant desire to explore the far reaches of useless trivia; what can I say I'm curious, and such curiosity often takes me beyond the textbook.  Yesterday I watched a 1998 documentary entitled, "Hole In The Head", a gory, yet eerily fascinating show about Trepanation, the ancient and recently-revived-modern act of drilling a hole in one's head to increase brain blood flow.  Woh, stop right there.  Yes, there were interviews with incredibly intelligent people, talking about this and that...then they say, "oh yeah, and here's where I drilled the hole."  Ahhhhhh! The show even showed clips of Amanda Fielding's self-trepanation, complete with blood shooting out of the head as this woman drilled into her forehead. It was the sickest thing I'd ever seen and am still quite shaken up over it.  Those who do it say it makes them feel like an 11-year old again, the same clarity, what with all that negative pressure in the head re-balanced.  It makes them feel constantly high, but not incapacitated-high. Like half a marijuana high.  And I'm totally intrigued, thinking about how far people will go in life, especially so far as to cut a hole in their own head!  M  P.S. They (those that had done it) were saying that the skull has a mushy layer halfway through, so even though you think you may be done, make sure you go a bit further.....Ewwwwwwwww!

      I love this! Just the thing to bring back to reality all those New Age hippies looking for enlightenment.  (Just as an aside, I'm not against yoga, I've even tried it myself. I just find this awfully ironic.)  Don't ask me how, but I stumbled across a web page, a  urlLink Discussion Forum for Sufferers of Complications Resulting from Kundalini Yoga ! Who knew!?  When was the last time you had a "premature Kundalini eruption"? :)  Apparently this form of yoga can screw up your GI system, make you as frigid as a eunich and keep you teetering on the edge of insanity for years, if not the rest of your life.  Sounds like a good gamble.  Oh, but then they make sure to add, this is the very reason you should always practice with a swami, you know, those guys that charge thousands of dollars an hour to sit in front of you and "share" their energy.  Do I smell scam?  M

      (Somewhat of a continuation...)  I was laughing my ass off last night.  On the recommendation of a friend I watched this new show called, "Superstar USA", an American Idol spinoff on the WB. I say spinoff because the idea here is to look for the worst singer in America.  I watched a bit of the American Idol show, and while it had its moments I never felt that these people were anything but manufactured. Sure, that's a cliche, usually one that comes from a jealous moron making comments like, "Avril Lavigne sucks" or "Kenny G is gay". Quite frankly, let them do what they're doing, I could care less. Because more often than not these complaint-ridden bags of flesh are: - The dumb-as-a-rock jock, pissed off knowing that the Canadian punk rock girl wouldn't fuck him if he was a sk8er boy with a bottomless Colt 45 -and- - The couch-ridden butterball with NO hair, bad skin and a complete lack of suave, envious of the sax solist's success.  So let them do their thing...American Idol though, a bit much.  Which is why this Superstar USA show is just classic. It's what this world needs. Some people need to be brought down from their cloud. Sometimes the weakest calf in the herd needs to be made an example of.  Sometimes we have to show ourselves what sort of caliber of man & woman is out there, roaming our fertile lands.  Maybe that will help us avoid making the same mistakes twice.  ...I can't wait til the final episode. Until then though I am laughing my eyes sore!  M

      I've become a bit jaded these days.  It seems I can't trust people anymore. People are flawed: they make blatant mistakes, make the wrong choices, base their lives on false opinion, disregard common sense and see the world through a prism devoid of reason.  I've often wondered what it must be like to look at this world through the eyes of one of these people, from the religious zealot, to the animal activist to the girl with absolutely NO sense of rhythm.  What's going on in that little head of theirs? It would be a surreal experience to know this first hand, I'm sure. And when I get there I'd probably make a few changes of my own in that little brain, so when they return they'll see what I see. Now that would be a trip for them; sure, it would be a bit depressing every now and then, but things would be a lot more clear, making those happy moments all the more enjoyable...I think.

      I'm at the center of a major fuck up between three parties who are too beurocratic they can't say what's on their mind.  I'm talking about: 1. *** University (in the US) 2. ??? University (in Tochigi) -and- 3. The International Affairs Division (where I am).  This year we've arranged a homestay program specifically for our sister state, and are to have a completely unofficial, yet very symbolic, Agreement of Friendship signing ceremony at the end. *** University's Director of the East Asian Department is coming all the way to participate.  *** Uni clearly mentioned they want us to be a third party in the signing.  We AGREED, and now my office is playing that "we can't be a part of a signing like this, it's too official"-card.  The Japanese will jump on deals like, "One tomato for $3 or two for $10!", but when it comes to government policy, this wheel moves slower than arctic honey.  So NOW, my office is backing out of the signing deal. We're still doing the homestay program though, and this Director is still coming out. And since I'M the English/Japanese speaker I'VE got to tell *** University.  And they're going to be pissed off with ME! Fuck this shit! I'm not going down for this.  There was NO miscommunication here. I kept everything out on the table, so I am NOT taking the social fall.  But, either way this is going to ruin MY image among the *** University staff, all thanks to these fuckers.  M
