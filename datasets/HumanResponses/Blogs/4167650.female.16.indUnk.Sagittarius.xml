      My baby's sick...  I might cry, if he minded it... But now, that's not fair to him.

      As usual, I haven't titled my poem..  It's quite shabby, so excuse me...  Untitled-  I never  dreamt  things too impossible for me, Otherwise I knew I'd forever be disappointed. But one hope I could never shake loose, Was my wanting                     to fly... Then one day, I was given wings. And I called            the love of all my                              soul ...  Being you .   Anyway, so that's my poem for these nine months... It's an accomplishment for me, but of course I feel it's a gift more and more each day... More than anything else.

      So the Travis Picking isn't the easiest..  Hehe!  Fortunately I have an enate sense of time, so it's not too difficult as of now.  It will get harder, obviously, when it's time to take things at the usual pace.. I am hoping though, that it sounds better than the original plan.. I don't want to work hard for nothing, ya know?  I do anyway..  As for piano.. I couldn't get the plug to work today!  I tried for a good 5 minutes.. Unplugging and replugging everything in!  Oye!  Electricity is overrated! Haha, yes that's my mature and rational side speaking!  Would anyone like to read my official newspaper article?  Well, here it is:   When it comes to summer, how many of you sit around for 3 months? How many of you get into a depressed mood because you don’t see anyone from the day school let’s out until the day it let’s in? This is a piece for those who didn’t go anywhere, probably because you didn’t know where to go!  Lots of relatives come out during summer, from other states in completely different areas of the country! You might enjoy their company, as well as their experiences with brand new things and places! Kasturi Patel took her Philadelphia family all over this great state! Kasturi took them to see the Hollywood sign, visit the Hollywood walk of fame, and her cousin met Kermit the Frog.  If the family won’t come to you, go and see them! Jennifer Laub went down to lovely San Diego to visit her cousins. There she went to Sea World, what’s better than spending the day with your family and America’s favorite Orca? Jenni had a great time shopping, it never seems to be the same when you’re not at home. The mall of another city is always better to shop in!  No incentive to visit others? No problem! Do what you’ve meant to all this time! Summer assignments could always have more work put into them, or like me, I took Driver’s Ed, so finally I will be driving! Next year, when summer comes around, what will you do? You can just ask around if you’re summer is looking lame, or if you’re obligated to keep family from having a lame summer too!  **El Tigre rocks socks!

      Today I had music lessons, first time in two weeks!  It was good to get back..  For Let It Be Me, I've decided to take on a whole new way to play.. Dangerous, seeing as how I've worked all summer on this, but.. I've got at least 2 months, might as well take this puppy on!  Muah ha!  See, before I'd just strum the whole song.  We've now decided (me and my teacher) that I'm going to try Travis Picking for the verses and strum the chorus.  Does that sound good to anyone other than me and him?  I do hope so!  For piano, quite a horse of a different color.  From what I assumed to happen, that is!  PHEW!  I've got my recording pushed back to September..  Thank gravy, cuz I'm anything but prepared!  For today, I think that's about it.. Later.

       Hmm, well, it seems I should tell people about this little dude or else no one will read it! Heh. Not much has gone on today, I keep wanting to write a song, but my limited knowledge or memorized repetoire of chords on the guitar have left me to very little to work with. As you may imagine. I have some lyrics here and there and a tune here and there... Just don't have the resources or something like that. Perhaps writing it for piano would be easier.. I really don't know right now.      In piano this month I'm supposed to record  Fur Elise ,  Sonatina  (and  Romanze ) and the  Wild Horseman  but I just don't feel like sitting down, plugging in the piano and playing right now! I don't know why, some sort of depression? Probably just typical laziness that is so keen to my age group.. Yes, I'll bet my cookies on that one. Heh, must work on that.. Or.. Don't work on it and just age out of it, being an irresponsible kid as long as I possibly can! No, I don't know, I think I'll get over myself by Wednesday when I'm scolded for lack of practicing.. And then get back into the "swing of things".      I've been having second thoughts on the Fall Concert. I do plan to audition for a solo with  Let It Be Me , but well.. I feel as though I've been insulting the  Everly Brothers  ever since I was inspired by a Senior's solo at our end of the year concert last June.. I mean, I don't have the best of singing voices but I have memorized the song as much as can be.. I don't know. I have a few people who will beat me if I dare back down. With that in mind, what fear should arise? Haha, my sarcasm gets me by..      I wrote a description of the Colorado River, the river house I visit one week every August and the sheer beauty that is within this trip. However, I lost it, and now my sorrow sings through this blog. Haha, that was a funny line.. Anyway, I'm hoping to find it again so that I may post it here for all to read, since this is for my more.. Imaginitive side.. Although.. I am rather imaginitive and creatively in tune all the time anyhow..    Must get the word out.. Must..

       I worked on  "Let It Be Me"  for a whole hour, and moved it up to the 6th.  I decided that I like the 5th the best, because it's here that I sing fullest.  The only thing I don't like is how thin the chords sound.  I like my guitar to be bold and noticable... However, on the 5th it sounds almost like a Ukeleli, which isn't my aim, but being a Soprano--the high notes are best!      My day brightened immensely with the finding of  "Blackbird"  and  "Yesterday"  which are rare versions to find, which I thought I had accidentally thrown out at least a year ago...  Their easier versions of the songs by far, but I just love how it sounds and it's fun to play!  So, I worked on those for a bit, got a bit frustrated that what I once had down to a T was now a bit hazy, but I still had a good time with them!      Still annoyed with my piano... It's an   electronic 88 key Technic keyboard  ...  Since we've renovated our kitchen, our phone has to go in the plug for the piano.  So everytime I want to play I have to unplug my line and reinsert the piano plug, so as not to interrupt the house line.. Oye!  I hate it!         Fur Elise  is getting better, but I'm mostly excited to start  Arebesque ...  The  Sonatina   in   A minor  and it's  second movement   Romanze , is coming along somewhat..  Since I was on vacation for 2 weeks, I just haven't been up to practicing lately.  So yes, come this Wednesday, I'm sure I'll be served something of a harsh sort due to my idleness toward the good old ivories!  Even though this is some cheap material which is at least weighted, for my biggest thrill...      So yes, that's about all in the world of my musical life...  Not too exciting, but it gets me by...

       I noticed this on the tennis player's blog, so I figured, what the hay? May as well express myself as I was meant to! So, if this really is a place for poems and songs and artwork and all that right-side of the brain stuff, why don't I put something in? Hmm.. Here's a song from Incubus that I've been dying to find the chords to so I can play...        Here In My Room:
