       OMG! I don't think I have ever been more embaressed in my entire life! Just about oh umm 15-20 minutes ago, I was heading home with my mother from a church softball end of season party. Well, she decides that it would be a good idea to quote unquote...(sorry I prefer to tpye it that way lol....) embaress me...now doing this action is a very tough one indeed I must say. Her way of going about doing this is very thought out and well planned..well not really but that just gets your attention more. She does the thing that is so embaressing it could kill your perfect rep completely...well not really but close enough to it. Ok I bet you I'm making you go What IS IT!?!?! Ok, my mother, is driving down College St. takes a left turn at the second stop light, and then a right turn at the next. Now this road that we are traveling down now is old 68, which has BP Sloan center right beside it, next thing I know the windows are going down and she reaches for the remote to the cd player...I'm sitting there thinking..now what is wrong with this woman. She changes the cd player to her 70's Funk Music CD and blasts it. I know exactly what is coming next...we get near BP and she puts on her left turn signal and pulls into BP...I'm as low as I could possibly get in my Mom's 4 door hunter green 01' Ford Windstar SE. Yes...a mini van....I was rding with my mom cruising the BP!!!! THANK YOU MOTHER! Yes....you got that right...she did move up to my #1 slot on my ever so long hit list! No Keisha you didn't lose everything..I saved a close 2nd place for you!! A......HA! I thought it was amusing....oh well, I need to go puke... I think I will never go out again...If anybody is out there tell my friends I lived a good life and that I love them..but my social life is about to commit suicide.       ~Later Dayz~

       Alas...&nbsp;I'm sad to say that I did not get to see Robbie, sorry to dissapoint anyone who really was in need of seeing a hot guy. But, I did have a great time at the  urlLink DCI  competition (Drum Corps International). It was sooo awesome! I got to see the world champions of last year up close and personal..and my all time favorite band.... urlLink THE BLUE DEVILS !!!!! And I got to see the kick ass show of the  urlLink Madison Scouts . They rocked!! I even liked their show more than the Blue Devils...altho it was a really close race between the two. The  urlLink Carolina Crown  is coming up and fast to be in the top spots this year. From the looks of the performance last night, minus the  urlLink Cadets'  and the  urlLink Cavaliers ' show, I'd say Blue Devils in either 1st or 2nd, and the Madison Scouts right with them, and then Carolina Crown in the top 5 at least! Good luck next week to Scouts and the Devils, and plus my 2nd fav the Cadets...even tho I didn't get to see them play (cuz they didn't show!!) I root for them all the way! They are the DCI band I hope to performe with one day before I turn 21!!! I'll start with the small one tho and go with Carolina Crown this year!   Oh yeah and The Devils won, with the Scouts in a close second! It's gonnabe a great show in Denver at the Championship! Here&nbsp;is a link to&nbsp;the scores from last nite's DCI competition results:  urlLink SCORES.    Till Next Time..    &nbsp;  ~Laterz~

       rant     &nbsp;  ok, so I've got this computer I built for myself. And if't got all the nifty little features, and it's pretty fast. But beneath all of this good hardware is  shitty  software, microsoft to be exact! If this were a Mac, I would not have these problems! Life would be much better, and I would go to sleep earlier, resulting in me being better rested for the next day of hell called life. Why you ask? Well, every time I tell my computer to "Shut Down", I turn off my monitor and leave the room. Then I come back the next morning, and I hear this soft whine, sorda like a computer running. Then I look down and see those bright LED lights on the front of my case, they sorda resemble police lights, and I realize my computer never turned off! So my screename has been online ALL night, and I have to go through and see what 6 or 7 people tried to talk to me about around 1-2AM that night. Too bad I wasn't there to answer them! So now, I have to wait, and wiat, for my computer to turn itself off. It has to Ctrl+Alt+Del 3 or 4 programs everytime to close up shop. And now, I've got this Virus that Norton(An Antivirus software that is supposed to fix these!) remains on my computer, which is something I need to deal with. I'm fine with that, but Norton reminds me every second of the freaking day it's still there. Ill close out the notice window, only to have a new one pop up! And then, I'll shut down Zone Alarm because I can't access ANY websites, and I get 40 pop ups telling me my next vacation should be to the Bahamas, and that *if* I'm not satisfied with my performance in the bed, I can get  LOADS  of medication to fix all that up nice and right. Woohoo!   I'm just about to throw this PC box out the window and bite the big bullet ($) for a Mac!   Until nexttime when my computer lets me access the web again!   T

       So, this is our last year, and you're supposed to be closer with your friends then ever before right?!?! Wrong! I think the reason why we are starting to get annoyed by one another is because we have been with eachother for so long and now we are so close to getting out that we just want to get away from it all. We have pretty much had enuf of eachother. 7 years of one person can get tireing, but this year is also about finding out who your real friends have been all along. You know the ones that are still friends with you right now.&nbsp; During this final summer, I have lost my best friend of 3 years, and my boyfriend, but the boyfriend&nbsp;I broke up with. And I am not dating ever again! I hate guys! I don't think this is the end of losing some more friends, but I don't think I'm not going to stop making new ones either.&nbsp;This part of your life I believe is a real eye opener. You get big realizations with friendships, what you want to do with your sad life, where you stand, and basically who you are. I am becoming more aware of my abilities and my personality. I pretty much know what I want in life now. Unlike about 3 years ago I was still saying I wanted to be an actress...silly, or a vet, when I can't stand the sight of blood or gory things, and then there was this part of me that wanted to be a meteorologist, when I hate science and math. It's been crazy when I look back on it.&nbsp; This once again hasn't been a funny story but oh well I really don't care. It will all come soon just whenever school starts, right now I'm just rambling on about nothings. Ok signing off!

      Ok, so its not quite school time yet, but with senior pics we already feel like its over.&nbsp; It's sad to think those will be our last school pictures to be taken for the yearbook. Oh and not to mention senior pages. OMG don't get me started on it!! But anywho, I promised funny stories from what happens to us, and well by gaw I'll give you one!! This happened to me actually. But of course most of this stuff normally does happen to me anyways! Anywho, I get to school and go inside to sign in and get my ID card or whatever it is. I brought my almost a year old German shepherd with me to get a few pics in with her. We go inside and walk into the cafeteria and I wait to sign in and watch everybody else's pics get done. As I do this I hear faint squirt noises behind me. I don't really pay much attention to it. But, I really should have!!! Because next this gush of a nasty aroma fills&nbsp;the whole cafeteria and&nbsp;all of its occupants noses!! I turn to look and there is my lovely dog&nbsp;standing beside her enormous pile of poop that she had&nbsp;just laid. I have never been so embarrassed&nbsp;in my entire life!! Well there was this one time...but we won't get into that. I had to clean up her non-shaped pile of poo with paper towels. It was so disgusting! I&nbsp;about gagged on top of it!! BLAH! I was of course angry with her but then I realized that she had had a stressful day too because she had been cooped up all that morning at the groomers. So I apologized and gave her a hug. Then we went to go get our pics done together. But yes, it was rather gross and yet I find it to be so hilarious!! Welp, band camp&nbsp;is coming up soon, so expect more to come from that!!! &nbsp; This is Micaela, *signing off*

      The class of 2005 at SQHS is on its last year here. We are now going to be seniors. As exciting as it sounds,......well hold on this is exciting!!!! More freedom than we could have ever imagined! Well for those of us who have parents who need to know your every move and all your whereabouts like me it is! Plans for this year to come are very exciting I must say! We are obviously gonna be more daring than the norm, well I can't get much more daring than I already am!! And NO! I have never been sent to the office or dentention before!!! I'm careful and I have connections with the teacher world...I don't get into trouble I just cause it!! Yes there are the occasional sentence writings but, eh I lived! This is the start to a very exciting webpage from all the stories I will be getting in almost everyday when school starts!! So don't worry, this story may be the pits..but come on its Summer...not much takes place that is drop dead funny during it!! So..there!! Signing Off- Micaela

       First day of my senior year came and went....I had so much fun...sarcasm is in major play right now by the way.  Let me recap the happenings of the night before to the night of my first day of school. I went to this banging party the night before...stayed up till around 4:30 5 am...so I got basically 1 1/2-2 hours worth of sleep.... I am such an over acheiver..it was the  excitement of school I tell ya..not really..we just didnt feel the need to go to sleep. So yeah like 3 am that morning we were starving so we left my friends house and went to the local Taco Bell/ Krystal and got us some food! Well, then it was time for us to get ready for school.  SO we all went to school together...we blasted our music when we drove around..."Tear It Up"...We were srtuttin it..we seniors....yeah yeah... Much Love to the Class of 2005!. Welp anyways I about crapped when i got my schedule...it sucked..I had to get it changed right away.. Cuz i was in stupid classes...my schedule was all F'ed up. But I got it fixed and then I went home fell asleep...was soo dead....woke up and went to another party. Awesome life in Mad-ville yo...much love...anyways first full day is this monday...can't wait....ha!   More to come sooner or later...      ~Laterz~

      Well, with the senior years comes quite a few new things.  Freedom. - Well I've never really had curfews or any of that crap, but I do feel as though I don't have some of the strings I once had tugging back at me. A good example of this is me staying out at night for the past few days. Mom calls around 11ish and I tell her I'm still out in town, hse goes to bed, I arrive at home whenever the crowd at the local BP(or the picnic shelter on those rainy days) decide it's time to pack it in for the night. (See seperate paragraph on "cruising the local hot spots). Anyway, so now that I have freedom, I now am up to bat for making my Mom upset. I unlocked the door tonight with her asleep on the couch waiting for me. Woohoo, not a word was said, she just woke up, turned off the tv, and went to bed without saying a word. I can tell she really enjoys this.  So Old so soon? - Yes, I know, it's so HARD to imagine that my parents little baby has grown up already. I'm not the first child to start applying to college, but it's scaring them to death knowing that in only a few short months, they will have sent all 3 of their children to college. I suppose back in the day(and I do mean back in) that sending all 3 of us to school after high school was going to be hard to do. Anyway, it's killing my Mom to know that soon I'll be moving away. Even 4 hours away seems to far for her. I don't forsee myself compromising my first choice college for a mere few miles drive.  Choices? - Good lord! What colleges do I even begin with? I have so many places in mind I'd love to look into, but it's already Fall of my Senior year and I haven't travelled to visit any of them. Ah well, I was told to buy the U.S News 100 Top UNiversities and Colleges( sometihng like that) so I guess thats where I'll start.  Money. - Wow, school hasn't started yet and most of us have spent a couple hundred $$ on senior pictures alone. I didn't know public school was expensive. haha. But I mean seriously, there is so much you have to buy just because you're a senior, blah blah blah.  Thats enought o ramble on about for now, I'm about to go to bed.  T  Cruising the Local Hot Spots. - There are two sides to cruising. The Good, and The Bad. The Good. - People who are simply out at the local fast food places looking for people to talk to to pass away the time. They might be showing off their possessions(girls, cars, etc.) but they are generally there to pass away the slow time that has engulfed  Madisonville. A few ways to describe this group are: not routy, not loud and obnoxious with thier huge subwoofers or spinning out every time they go to pull out of a place. The Bad. - Yea, this right here is the reason everyone hates people crusing out in town. I've experienced it first hand, and I hate it too. The are loud, and want to "show off" their ride. Be it a V6 Camaro(also known as SLOW) or a 1986 Ford Bronco II, it doesn't matter. They both have bald tires, and by god!, they want everyone to turn and look as they peel out every 10 feet through the parking lot. One of the biggest problems I have with this is the fact that it's dangerous. Usually there will be 10+/- cars lined up against the side walk, and it's not exactly a good idea to make your vehicle lose control while driving around this $100k worth of cars. Thats not even considering the fact that with those 10 cars are atleast 20 passengers. Another problem with these people are the fact that because they act stupid, local law enforcement are forced to come and remove everyone sitting in the parking lot, be it peaceful or violent. It doesn't matter, but by golley there can't be a soul sitting in that parking lot. Thats the basic jist of it I suppose.

       Unlike Thomas, I'm not stressing as much as him. I, unfortunately, am not reading a book for an honors class. I really wish I was!! I am so mad at myself for not meeting the qualifications for English 12 Honors. I was in English 11 Honors, and I passed, with descent grades to say the least. If you know Ms. Heiskell, an 83 is an excellent grade in her English class...she is soo hard!!But, alas, I'm not reading and stressing and using my handy dandy web site that I used all last year in English instead of actually opening whatever book was given to me to read for a grade! Hey, I still passed the tests..so HA! As of right now, I'm redoing my room. I'm getting a new bed, and new carpet, and new dresser, and a new computer desk. Maybe there will be a computer with it....hmmm...Anyways, I have also done alot of school shopping, and I am anticipating the night before school..Big party, and a great next day! It'll be memorable! NO that doesn't mean I'll be showing up at school with a hangover..losers.... :) Anywho, I'm bored...I wish I was stressing...I have to baysit all this week from 7am- 3pm, then on Thursday, we have band from 5-8pm...yeah... bored to death... and actually anticipating the first day of school...      ~Laterz~

      Ugh! Thats about all I ahve to say right now. It's 4 days till school starts, and I already feel behind. There seems to be some things that I wanted to do before school starts, and now it's doubtful that much of any of it will happen. Here are a few key things that need to happen before Friday, @ 8:00AM.  1. Read "All Over But the Shoutin'" - Rick Bragg, why you as? Because I have a test over the entire book on the first day of school, shoot me now!  2. Get my mess of a room/inside of car cleaned up so I actually have a little room to work with. I'm sick of climbing over things to sit inmy chair at my computer.  3. School shopping maybe? My Mom hasn't mentioned a thing about it, and I wouldn't mind spending a little while shopping for some new stuff. But what day do I do that on?  4. Read 2 other books that I'll eventually be tested over.  5. Procrastinate about all of that, and enjoy the last few days of freedom a little more.  Can I get an Amen?

      Well, it's past Midnight-Thirty, and I'm just now going to bed. I still didn't do what I intended to do when I sat down at the computer.  Things to do later sometime. Balance Checkbook (ugh) Work on iPod, I think it's defective, I'm getting static in speakers. May be replaced! Catch up on sleep. Read stupid books.  Yep, I'm very behind, and school hasn't even begun yet!  Save me,  T

       Welp  ..I hate to say it but I told him so! Thomas hasn't posted anything recently because he went on trip to Nashville with his internet buddies....yes internet buddies. He claims he knew who they were..but secretly they were all mass murderers out to kill him... You were a good guy...sumtimes. We'll miss you a lil bit. He met these people off a site about Saturn Cars...go figure. They took a roadtrip to Nashville to see the Saturn car factory. I told him tonot go....but he did..and now he is dead...I'll keep his legacy going on here.....well I can't....I'm not obsessed with cars like he is..oh well farewell stupid webpage partner!!      ~Laterz~    (this is a joke by the way..he isn't really dead..altho I know sum who wish he were!! AHA!)
