      I can't figure out how credit scores work. Am I alone? I think not. I found a great website called CreditForum.org or something like that and found a whole slew of people who are fighting/suing/etc the Credit Reporting Agencies for fraud and other law violations. So many things I didn't know. Did you know you can make a company pay $1000 or even up to $2500 if you've lost somehow by their infraction for pulling your credit report without a valid, permissible reason? Like, if you haven't applied for a job or credit or anything with them? I've spent the last few days going over laws and rules and regulations and I just have learned SO much about credit. Such as, that if you pay off something old on your credit, your score does NOT improve (it can get  worse ). It's actually better to leave something there if it's old and you can wait for the Statute of Limitations (usually 7 years for most stuff) to make it drop off your report, because even if you pay it off, there is no guarantee that they will remove it from your report. They have to remove it from your report 7 years from the time of FIRST DELINQUENCY, even if it was paid on a few times but never brought current, or wasn't charged off for a couple years later. Also, you have the right to send a letter to any company saying you owe them money stating that you dispute their claim, and they have to notify the credit bureaus that you have disputed it and they then have 30 days to verify all charges in detail or else they are required by law to remove it from your credit! AND if they try to look at or pull your credit report because of this, you can then SUE them for at least $1000.  So many things I didn't know. It's nice for me because I was about to pay off a bunch of old things that are about to drop off my credit anyway, and I found some things on there from like 10 years ago that I can now dispute and have removed or I can sue for a grand or two. Nice.  One of the only exceptions goes to government student loans... really glad I paid that one off, though. It had previously defaulted and I decided a couple years ago to start cleaning up my credit, so I finally got it paid off just on June 28th of this year.  Scott and I have an official song. It's 311's remake of The Cure's  Love Song . :) I love Scott.  He has just been told he has to work Saturdays from 2 to 10pm, which means I won't get him till 11pm Saturday nights. Sigh. :( At least it's all overtime for him. But I miss him already.   My brother comes home from the Navy tomorrow night!! W00t!!! I'm picking him up from the airport after I get off duty around midnight. I'm excited. Mike hasn't met Scott yet.  They will get along really well. :D

      I can't believe I am chilly and it's August. It's supposed to be unbearably hot right now, but I'm sitting here with goosebumps from the cool breeze. It could just be because of the rain, I suppose.  Scott left for work. I don't like him to see what I write, because then I feel like he restricts what I have to say. I don't like to feel hindered in any way. He ate his breakfast of a frappucino and chocolate poptarts (How can he stay at his perfect weight when he eats like that every meal of the day? Grrr!!! ;))  and then drove off in his wet car seat because he left his window cracked. Hehe.  Sex with Scott is the best that I have ever, ever had in my life. I'm not sure if it's just because of the emotional connection that we have, too, although I'm sure that has a lot to do with it. Before  Scott, I never ever knew that I could have an orgasm during sex. It only happened once in my life, when I was 19 (and completely by accident and surprise),  and now almost every time we are intimate I am able to have an orgasm during actual intercourse. Even if I don't, I never feel pressured to pretend like I do - he knows that I really think it just feels really good and I don't need to get off every single time.  Last night we ended up in a position where he was inside me from behind (I hate saying "doggie style" because it's so impersonal) and it felt so good but he has a really large penis and sometimes it hurts when he gets really excited. Then we have to slow down and start over. So sometimes it takes a long time that way because I have to keep making him stop. I'm not sure why it only hurts in that position. And it's not all the time. It's just a weird feeling because it also feels really, really good.  Two days ago we were making love. Scott had his arms around my shoulders and was cradling my head in his hands and he said "I love you, Melissa" right in the middle. I just wanted to cry because I was so happy. But, I know most guys have a fear of women crying during sex... so I really had to try not to. I don't think he would have thought badly of it in any way, I think it's just something that's been ingrained in my mind by other men or movies. It was so beautiful... I will never forget that moment.  Speaking of beautiful, I am now off to patrol the streets. Blah. In the rain.

      This is my first entry. I have a lot to say but right now I am distracted by the opening menu of the Family Guy DVD in the background. "Hi! I'm Petey the Pistol!" Scott just got home from work and right now, as usual, he is eating chocolate. I could probably somehow get him to eat the green food he hates if I dipped it in chocolate. But, as long as he's happy... I'm happy. So I'll leave him to his unhealthy chocolate. ;) And now, we're going to have sex.  mmm, chocolate sex.
