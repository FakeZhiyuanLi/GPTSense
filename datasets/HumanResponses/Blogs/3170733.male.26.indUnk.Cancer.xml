      Before i start i would like to state that this letter is adressed to a totaly fictional person, therefore any simmilarities to existing persons is purely based on coincidence.  Dear J.  I have been watching your show now for a few random episodes, and I must say it surprises me how someone, that is supposed to be a rolemodel to our youth, can be such a complete and utter airhead as you have demonstrated in said random episodes. I have watched in awe after you have purchased 1400 dollar sheets, and then do not know how the washing machine works, I know the on and off switch are ussualy well hidden on these aparatus, but still, doesnt really take Einstein to figure it out.  You then go on demonstrating your lack of life experience, and may i say braincontent by picking fights with your husband, about the most futile and infantile subjects. And unfortunately I can not think of one right now, but I think the flavour of the peanut butter would be a subject of ample discussion in your presence.  I have to applaud your husband for taking all this grieve so sportingly, because I personally would have beaten the crap out of you with your 3000 dollar high heels. Then again for a few thousand more i could have easily installed a couple of more IQ points. At least we would have some well arguemented bullshit about peanutbutter from then on. Instead of your blonde haired pouty lipped puppy face, when your about to lose the arguement to your obviously higher IQ point scoring husband.  Before you pout and say, but Ah didnt know this was a game, please don't.  Now then I would rant on, but I think you hooked of after the first more then 6 letter word passed this weblog, so for now I will not bother you anymore.  I wish you more bliss, seeing your fully able to be ignorant.  Regards,  Muddy

      Oh, they say some people long ago Were searching for a diff’rent tune One that they could croon As only they can They only had the rhythm So they started swaying to and fro They didn’t know just what to use That is how the blues really began They heard the breeze in the trees Singing weird melodies And they made that the start of the blues  And from a jail came the wail Of a down-hearted frail And they played that As part of the blues From a whippoorwill Out on a hill They took a new note Pushed it through a horn ’til it was worn Into a blue note And then they nursed it, rehearsed it And gave out the news That the southland gave birth to the blues!  Just wanted to post these lyrics, made famous by Frank Sinatra and other members of the Ratpack.

      It's 7 pm, I'm having dinner (normal wouldnt you say). Phone rings, why? you may ask. Or if you are like me, you actually already know. Yes ladies and gentleman, I am talking about the scum of the earth that call themselves telemarketeers, or as some people call themselves, telephoneticaly orientated sales executive (now admit you have to be full of it to come up with that one.) converstation as follows:  -Good evening sir, am i interupting * yes you are - oh, im sorry, anyway, may i ask...do you read a newspaper * No i ussualy put my elbows on it and telepathicaly absorb all the stories - Oh my sir, you are original * No kidding - Yes, so i'm calling on behalf of ACME newspapers inc * And? (voice moving into irritated anger) - Well i was wondering if you wanted a subscription on this fine warm night in august * You mean this hot humid over 30C night in august - Oh yes, so can i book you for half a year? * No, you may not - And why not if I might be so impolite to ask? * Because I already HAVE, or should i say HAD a subscription 2 your newspaper - Oh, but the...HEY MARTY! You gave me the wrong #$&*&*&# list - (muffles shouting and cursing) * Hello? - Im sorry, we got the wrong call list, I hope this doesnt affect your subscription to our fine newspaper * Guess... - ::click::  I don't ussualy let it go so far, my current record of hanging up on these people stands at 2 and a half seconds, which is just enough for them to say, hello sir am i interrupting anything? But i was in a good mood, so what the hey.  So if your reading this, and want to sell me anything, don't. Much obliged :)

      What is it with these old people, they think they reach the ripe age of 65 and think the world is theirs to command. This piece is adressed to those elderly people who think that and ride along in their oldpeople scooters and especialy when they use them in the supermarket. I would say you know im talking about you. But you wont even bother to read this, cuz the internet is not for old farts like you, or so you say and bitch to me about ATM machines. So anyway, f off. Thank you.  Now that thaz of my chest. How is it possible for you people to be even more annoying then when you bitch about not understanding society, or worse, not understand why young people like myself can't stand the workstress anymore. Cuz you all worked 10 hour shifts in the steelmill yada yada. Ok, people wondering what im talking about, its those "handicapped" elders that ride a "scootmobile" across the supermarket and always hit my heels. Not to mention hitting the stand full of carefully stacked beerbottles, but i agree, that might have 2 do with me reversing the wires of your badly kept scootmobile.  Why do you do it? Is it revenge for the fact you actually don't have a life a part from bugging your grandchildren and making them feel sorry for taking you into their homes and take care of you? Or is it some perverted fun to be had, which can only be shared at the ripe age of 65+?  So next time you step onto your 2 mph helldemon to fuck with my temper after a hard days work, remember, I'm an IT guy, I carry wire cutters.

      Ok, call me crazy here, but if you see a show involving a christian motorclub, well it might be a bit strange, seeing you don't associate rough biker people (mullet and all), with the word of the lawd (insert stupid giggle here).  Anyway, profoundly interested as I was in this strange phenomenon on dutch television, I decided not to change channels and keep on watching. The reason for said show was because of the publishing of a portable bible for bikers, so that when on the road they can convert people to christianity. Now somehow I think this might cause some serious problems. Picture the following if you will:  You are quietly walking down or driving down the road, when a pack of bad looking bikers on hogs (thaz harley davidsons for you non motor interested people), stop in front of you. You are scared out of your wits, the clubs, guns and occasional riot gun helping the sensation allong. When they walk up to the side of your car, and through your closed window shout. Do you have a couple of minutes for the lawd. Jehova's witnesses and Born again Christians on steroids if you ask me. And what if you say no, will you be dragged behind a harley on a chain, will they first tear down your car and then preach the gospel anyway. WHAT!?  Anyway, I for one am gonna be on the look out for crazed biker jehova's  And I'm still waiting for that portable version of the jerusalem wailing wall. Thank you

      What is it today, national retard appreciation day? I've now been to the vet and back and been hassled about my cat by 3 of em (and i really mean mentally challenged people). By the way, if you are planning on commenting on this post with something like...they aint called retard they is mentally challenged people. Please find yourself a well secluded spot and don't hesitate to go fook yourself.  With al that said an done. Don't get me wrong i've worked with MCP's before (thaz including retards and microsoft certified professionals (thought i'd state that in case there is a difference.)) But why always me, why can't they plague the ugly girl next to me who is to thin and to stupid and to ugly to actually wear the stuff she's wearing.  Guess I'm doomed to a life with morons around me (at work, on the street, luckily not in my social life :) ).

      I was at home this afternoon, beeing a bit tired and just surfing some tv channels and it suddenly hit me that the whole life of the family flipper is accomponied by entire life somehow revolve around the water. This causes some strange situations to arise.      Let say the youngest kid reaches his early twenties by now, and doing his patriotic bush-i-nist duty, flies to iraq. How then would it go, a big fish tank on the back of a Abrahms tank. Beeing bush's answer to WMD, "yeah we thought if Blix don't work we'd try the damn dolphin for a change." "What is it flipper? What you spotted bad bad uncle Osama with a batch of Vx gas. Flipper, why are you turning green? FLIPPER!! OH MY GOD NOOOOOOO." "Sgt. Smithy they killed flipper, you bastids!".  And after the military fishfry they all go home happily to their tents.

      As so well sung by Billie Holiday:  Southern trees bear strange fruit,  Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,  Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,  Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.   Pastoral scene of the gallant south,  The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,  Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,  Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.   Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,  For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,  Here is a strange and bitter cry.

      Yes, again it's time for me to vent my frustration with the world, and all the morons in it. For those who know me, bare with me, for those who don't and have the feeling that this is already going waaaay beyond anything they would ever comprehend, f**k of*.  Today started out as any ordinary day, I took a shower and sat myself down in front of some saturdaymorning entertainment (saturday kitchen, my usual saturday morning cooking show.) Unfortunately I woke an hour earlier then usual, and thought of passing said time by flipping through some channels (didnt feel like anything else anyway.) When it switched on the 2nd public network channel there turned out 2 be the european championships athletics (floor excersise, beam etc). I, beeing a great admirer of superhuman ability to stretch and turn limbs into places they shouldnt be, watched in awe. The unfortunate thing about dutch channels showing sports is that the events are also commented on by, yes you guessed it, dutch sporting commentators. And I can safely say after various experiences with non dutch commentators (including the germans), they SUCK at their job. This commentator in particular had made an art of saying things that wouldnt be interesting even if they could change the course of worldhistory, and not only that he was very capable of stating the very obvious. An example: The event shown was that of the beam excercise, which involves a very young eastern european girl and a wooden beam smaller then my garden fence (if i had a garden that is), and some summersaults, flips, jumps etc. Not only did this girl lose balance thusly that she had 2 jump of the beam, with a comment from our grand dutch commentator somewhere in the region of "well folks, that wasn't what she meant to do". But also did she make her departure of said beam, by making a jump misjudging her landing so far that she headbutted the beam before landing on her ass. "Well folks, she might have some points deducted there." said my now favorite hated person on the globe. I mean, i know the average IQ of the dutch tv viewer barely reaches 90 if it registers at all, but please.  I hereby vote that all sports should forthwith be broadcasted without any comment, or to make it funny, with some comments that only make you laugh.

      Yes ladies and gentleman, its that time of the decade again. We can all watch groups of 11 men running after a leather ball again, whilst they compete for the 2004 European Cup.  As you might gather from this intro, I myself am not a great big fan of the national pasttime, soccer.  Why, what is not to like about it, you might wonder. Well let's see, I was born 25th of june 1978, the day that our national team of ballchasing losers lost the World Cup to Argentina (as the irony might have it our future queen is of Argentinian descent, but she's cute, so they tell me she is "forgiven".) As you might imagine my birthday ussualy coinsides with people remembring it not as my day of birth but as the day of the losing of the world cup, and I can imagine that beeing of such great historical importance it is something to sob about (or you might actually consider getting a life.) So that is the first reason i do not like soccer, second of all, my birthday ussualy ends up beeing a day our national team of "people who look like deer caught in your headlights" is playing some very important match, therefore causing all the people I invite to cancel, becuz "well "they" are playing ya know". So as you can imagine, alhthough im not one to carry a grudge, i am really pissed off at the goddamn sport.  Apart from my birthday related missery, there are a few other points that make me loath it. They players of the sport get payed millions, even if they sit it out on the bench for a full year. Now somewhere with the millions people lacking money to support themselves and starving of hunger, lack of medication or education. That seems very very wrong. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against those people who go out in the weekend to play for their amateur soccer club. I would almost say all the more power to them. Another thing that really irritates me is the "orange fever" that brakes out during these international championships, everything here is orange, the bricks in the wall, the birds if caught and what not more is painted or decorated orange. It also means that whether you like it or not, you shall enjoy the rantings of soccer minded people without and concern about your views towards the sport. No complete strangers is half drunken states fall around your neck and start yabbering on about how good "we" are performing, or if the latter is not the case, how "we" are beeing fucked over by refferee's, bad soccer balls, bird droppings, flashlights, pneumonia causing winds, fireworks, and what not. I'm still waiting for the "well yes but venus was in the 3rd house" excuse. Direct consequence of the orange fever, is the merchandising wave that breaks out, and i can't really blame the companies wanting there 10 cents worth of profit from it all. I do however mind how it is beeing forced down your throat, walk into a supermarket, make the unfortunate mistake of spending more then 20 euro's and the head of one of our "orange legionaires" is yours, my only comment to the girl behind the counter was, too bad it isnt a real head, resulting in some drunk idiot wanting to beat me up. We are constantly beeing bombarded with orangen hats, orange t-shirts, orange beer, orange soda, orange oranges (ehm....yah), some anti germany related slogans, orange televisions and not forgetting orange condoms.  These are times where i wish i lived in some kind of country where soccer wasnt the national pasttime and i would not have to be part of this "orange wave of goodness". Ah well, guess it will be over in a month.

      "Is it me your looking for?" she asked, her voice husky from the night before, she smells of party, cheap flirts and questionable alcohol. I looked up from my half empty half full glass of god knows what they call it. " I might be" I answered, "If I'm not you must not be who you think you are" her smile was that of someone who knows your deepest secrets just by shaking your hand. She shook my soul, and I wasn't even surprised, the dreams I've had about her...no the dreams I've had about someone like her they were so vivid I didnt want to wake up. Now she is here shaking me at the core of my beeing, and now I am affraid. Her red hair lit up as she moved around me, blazing white and yellow and laserbeams through a curtain of red delight. "What is your name?". "knowing that would spoil that which you dreamed about me.", I swallowed hard, the taste of cheap alcohol, combined with the aroma of sleazy bar and good perfume lingered on my senses. "How...?" I never got a chance to finish, she touched my heart with her hand, then swiftly ran up the stairs, leaving me with nothing but a shaken soul and a stimulated mind. She was out of my life again, i can still feel her warm hand on my chest, the feeling didnt go away. I stood up, put my raybans on and walked into the bright tuesday morning.  --- Copyright notice, all i write in this log is subject to copyright, and may not be used or duplicated without express permission of the author (that would be me).
