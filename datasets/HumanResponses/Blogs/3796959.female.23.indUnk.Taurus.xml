      用我的晚安陪你吃早餐，记得把想念存进扑满。我望着满天星在闪，听牛郎对织女说要勇敢。别怕我们在地球的两端，看我的问候骑着魔毯飞用光速飞到你面前，要你能看到十字星有北极星作伴。少了我的手臂当枕头你习不习惯，你的望远镜望不到我北半球的孤单，太平洋的潮水跟着地球来回族转，我会耐心地等，随时欢迎你靠岸。少了我的怀抱当暖炉，你习不习惯。E给你照片看不到我北半球的孤单。世界再大两颗真心就能互相取暖，想念不会偷懒，我的梦通通给你保管。  我好想你。。。你呢？

      It was raining this morning.I listened to the radio and was playing Tian Hei Hei...I feel so sad listening to the lyrics..我爱上让我奋不顾身的一个人，我以为这就是我所追求的世界。然而衡冲直撞，被误解被骗，是否成人的世界背后总有残缺。我走在每天必须面对的分叉路，我怀念过去单纯美好的小幸福。爱总是让人哭，让人觉得不满足，天空很大却看不清楚好孤独。。。

      "The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain."  "The path of a relationship with true love is like a trip together down an old dirt path in the woods - sometimes it'll be beautiful and easy, other times it will be a rough walk with its ups and downs, turns and twists. But when you think you're out of the woods and you look back, you are glad the journey took place, and in all, you are glad you and your special someone took it together. But the journey is not over, you have only just begun. So, don't loose faith; keep on walking. If your love is true, the path you two take will never end."

      Baby,I knew you need the time to think and I shouldn't disturb you...But I feel like telling you sooooo much.....I've grown up....Suddenly I really feel I've grown...Someone whom you know too ask me along to Malaysia with her alone for a trip..She wanted to take a break as she was, too, facing alot of problems...At first I was quite alright with the trip but on second thought,I really start to think about you....Although you are still deciding and the outcome may not be what I want...I feel I din't want you or anyone to get worry about me...If I were to go,I definitely will inform you but to think back again,by informing you will again make you worry too....I decided not to go..I feel if one wants to cool down,it can be anywhere and not necessary to malaysia..And I thought she may not be in the right mind now and the more I shouldn't get influence by her..I decided I shouldn't go..coz truthfully,I didn't want anyone to get worry about me..She told me she may go alone instead...I didn't know what to say but to tell her,dun get anyone worry for you..coz I made that mistake and I may not be given a chance anymore..So,I'm not making the same mistake ever again coz it's far too high price to pay for it..How I wish you will know.....and give me a chance again.....anyway....I will wait..love you always...
