      Southampton 0 - 0  Blackburn After poor performance by both team in the first match, it is unlikely that will be any winner in this game.     Birmingham 1 - 2  Chelsea Chelsea would be a favourite to win the match, but the former Chelsea boys in Birmingham might just be worth a goal.    Charlton 1 - 0 Portsmouth Charlton will be fired up to bounce back from their loss to Bolton, making it a tough game for Portsmouth.      Crystal Palace 1 - 2  Everton Palace might hoped Everton bad form will continued to snatch the 3 points. However Moyes and his boys will not be pushovers and might find their scoring touches.      Fulham 2 - 3  Bolton  An interesting match that could see a goal spree if the strikers strike early. Bolton will look to build on their weekend success but Fulham at home will be difficult to shake off.     Liverpool 2 - 0 Man City  At Anfield, Liverpool look too strong for the Man City on paper. Unless Anelka end his goal drought, Liverpool will ended up being the comfortable winner.     Newcastle 1 - 2  Tottenham This will be a big test for former France manager travelling away from home for the first time. Newcastle seem to be troubled by the ongoing manager and players rifts. Spurs might just be able to get the results with a bit of luck.    Man Utd 1 - 0  Norwich  Wounded Man Utd will not accept another defeat so early in the season, therefore expect them to battle hard for this victory. Last season Man Utd's loss to Wolves might just give Norwich the motivation for a upset.  West Brom 0 - 3 Aston Villa West Brom have earned a draw last weekend with a slice of luck. Villa look strong and hungry for more success. This would turn up to be a real one-sided affair and West Brom need to work hard to limit the score down.    Arsenal 3 - 1 Middlesbrough  Will Arsenal go 42 matches undefeated to match the record undefeated streak. It will take a miracle to deny them and Boro might be lucky to escape with a draw. Both team might take an attractive attacking counter attack style, and this will be a beautiful match to watch.

      The EPL started last saturday with plenty of draws and huge wins for Arsenal and Bolton.  Results:  Everton 1 - 4 Arsenal   Chelsea 1 - 0 Man Utd Bolton 4 - 1 Charlton  Tottenham 1 - 1 Liverpool   Middlesbrough 2 - 2 Newcastle  Aston Villa 2 - 0 Southampton   Blackburn 1 - 1 West Brom     Man City 1 - 1 Fulham   Norwich 1 - 1 Crystal Palace   Portsmouth 1 - 1 Birmingham      Arsenal demolition of Everton by 4 goals to 1 helped them extend their undefeated run to 41 matches. Goals from Bergkamp, Reyes, Ljungberg and Pires gave Arsenal the perfect start to the season and was unlucky not to score more. Everton did scored a beautifully craved goal by Carsley, but it was no more than a consolation. The contrast between the teams was obvious, and Everton future seem bleak with this awful display.  Another huge match on sunday was between Chelsea and Man Utd, with the blues coming top in the encounter. A single goal by Gudjohnsen gave the new Chelsea manager his first win in English soccer. Man Utd, missing several key players, was competitive during the entire match, but just could not create enough chances to tie the game.    Bolton notched an impressive 4 - 1 win over Charlton due to the brillance of Captain Jay Jay Okocha. Okocha and Pedersen both scored two goals each while Lisbie replied for Charlton after missing a string of chances.  Spurs with a newly assembled team came from behind to snatch a draw from Liverpool. Cisse, the replacement for Owen who left to join Madrid, scored in his debut in the first half. However Defoe steal the lime light from the liverpool star in the second period. He showed great ball control and skills before steering the ball into the net.  Newcastle and Middlesbrough ended an exciting match with 2 goals apiece. Bellamy and Shearer repaid Robson's faith in them scoring one goal each. However their victory was denied by youngster Downing and the hand of Hasselbaink in the injury time.  Aston Villa started their season well with a cormfortable 2 goals win over Southampton. Vassell and Cole scored the goals to clinch the win. Southampton will be concerned after a disappointing performance by its players.     Newly promoted West Brom took home one point after drawing with Blackburn at Ewood Park. Clement beat the Rover keeper with a deflected free kick to give his team the lead after half an hour of play. It took 40 minutes of pressure from the home team before a unexpected equaliser by Craig Short.  Man City and Fulham also played to a 1 - 1 draw in their opening match of the season. The highlight of the game belong to Fowler after scoring a fantastic goal in the first half. Despite the goal and plenty of chances, Man City failed to killed off the game, and allowed John Collins to sneak past the defence and scored the vital goal.  The two new Premiership teams, Norwich and Crystal Palace, clash on the opening match. With both team realising the importance of every point, they worked hard and got a draw in the end. Darren Huckerby started the season with the goal for Norwich, while Andrew Johnson beat Robert Green, the England hopeful, at the other end.  Birmingham took the lead early in the first half through a great free kick by Robbie Savage against Portsmouth. However the lead was short-lived as new boy David Unsworth replied after five minuties through a penalty. In the end, the spolit was shared between the two teams.

      Arsenal gunned down the Red Devils in the Community Shield, the annual season opener for EPL. The 3-1 victory gave Arsenal their first silverware of the season, with goals by Gilberto, Reyes and an own goal courtesy of Silvestre. New boy Alan Smith played and scored the consolation goal for Man Utd, in the absence of top marksman, Ruud van Nistelrooy.  Despite the result is of relatively low importance to both teams, the match have revealed the weakness of Man Utd's defensive weakness and Arsenal's ability to cope with the absence of Vieira. Arsenal would be rather assured that they do have ample cover for their captain if Vieira agree to move to Real Madrid. Meanwhile Man Utd will have to tighten their defense and awaited the return of Rio. The wait hopefully will not be a costly one as the real quest for glory begin next weekend. However Man Utd might be ironically pleased with this defeat as the past winners of the Community Shield have failed to clinch the Premiership in recent years.

      Last season, Aston Villa impressive performance in the second half of the season saw them finishing sixth, narrowly missing out on an European spot. Juan Pablo Angel was one key reason for their improved performance, after his career was revived by David O'Leary. O'Leary have captured the signatures of Laursen and Bersson, while securing the bizzare loan deal of Charlton Cole from Chelsea during the summer. The lack of financial backing means O'Leary could not improved his squad as much as he would loved to. However there is still ample cover for the squad, especially with youth players emerging. A repeat of last season feat greatly lies in Angel whose performance vary with his mood.   Seventh placed Charlton will enter the new season with few changes, notably the inclusion of Dennis Rommedahl. Danny Murphy and Francis Jeffers are also looking for a revival of their career under the care of Alan Curbishley. Despite losing Scott Parker last season, Alan managed to lead their to the seventh position. This season, the team would be looking to improve on their standing. With a decent squad and money to cash in on new players, Charlton might just be able to achieve that.  Carling Cup's runner-up, Bolton, will yet again relies on proven and experienced players this new season. Sam Allardyce have roped in Fernando Hierro, Gary Speed, Les Ferdinand and Michael Bridges to strength his squad at a low cost. Their key attacking player, Jay-Jay Okocha, will carry the responsibility to improve the team performance. The long and hard season could take its toll on the aging players, and the team could find themselves in back in the bottom half of the table again.  Fulham, under the wings of Chris Coleman, have improved greatly over the last 2 seasons. The squad remained largely unchanged with new players coming in to replace players that have departed. Andy Cole and Tomas Radzinski will have to fit into the gap left by Saha, while Claus Jensen and Pape Bouba Diop will add cover for the midfield spots. The team comprises of a good mixture of players aged below 24 and above 30. It would be no surprise if Fulham end up in the mid table this new season.  Steve Bruce have transformed Birmingham from a relegation contender to a European spot contender. He have made record signings in the last 2 summer, David Dunn in the last summer and Emile Heskey in this summer. This summer saw several other established premiership players joining the club, including Jesper Gronkjaer, Muzzy Izzet and Mario Melchiot. With these quality players joining the squad that achieved tenth in the league last season, Birmingham looked certain to improve in the coming season.

      The exciting new season will start in 14th August. 20 outstanding clubs will once again do battle for the silverware. Defending Champion Arsenal will yet be at the top challenging and hopefully continue their undefeated run. However with rumors of club skipper Vieria leaving to join Real Madrid, the Wenger's boys will look upon Henry, the wonder striker, to lead them to another successful season.  Chelsea, the biggest spender in the transfer market, is not hiding their bold challenge to the defending champion for the title. The lack of trophy last season saw the departure of manager and players. In come Jose Mourinho, the man who led FC Porto to both the UEFA cup and Champion League success in recent years. The no-nosense coach have invested substantially on new faces like Ricardo Carvalho, Paulo Ferreira, Arjen Robben, Peter Cech, Didier Drogba, Mateja Kezman and Tiago Mendes to add depth to the Roman army. Whether success could be bought by money would really depends on the desire and hunger of the players.  The 03/04 season was a nightmare for Manchester Utd, finishing third in the league. The FA cup triumph was no more than a consolation for the red devils who have dominated English football for the past decade. New boy Alan Smith who arrived from Leeds could make an immediate impact as Ruud is ruled out for a month. The return of Rio Ferdinand will be eagerly awaited by both the club and its fans. The most expensive defender will ease the team defense problems that was exposed during his suspension. Sir Alex's gamble in tactics could be the deciding variable in their quest for another championship.  Since the start of the Premiership, Liverpool have not been able to win the prized trophy. Benitez, the newly appointed manager, might be the key to success for the team. With a talented pool of players at his disposal, Benitez could continue to enjoy success like his time in Valencia. Old boys Owen, Gerrard and Kewell will need to find their form back, and new boys like Djibril Cisse and Josemi need to gel with the team in the early stages. The results could see more than just a serious challenge for the title but an attractive playing style.  Sir Bobby Robson, in his final year as Newcastle manager, would hoped his team could surprise everyone in the league. The arrival of new blood like Kluivert, Butt and Milner would add depth to the squad. With a number of players peaking at the age of 27 to 30, Robson could just have the winning combo. However the manager's tactics and consistency of players' performance would be in the lights once again, which have left them behind the top teams in recent years.
