      I had a brief dream the other night. I must preface this with telling you about my ganglion cyst.  After a car accident we had in 2002, I developed a bump on the top of my wrist that seemed firm, but pliable.  This bump grew in size over a series of months and most times didn't inconvenience or hurt, though I felt it unsightly.  Occasionally it would seem to press on nerves and cause some arthritic like pain in my wrist.  One time when I twisted my wrist in an unnatural manner opening a refrigerator door in a store, it immediately went away.  What it is is a buildup of the fluid your body produces to lubricate your joints....through some kind of trauma, a hole and pocket is created into which the fluid leaks and builds up.  Occasionally another trauma (such as hitting it with a large book which was the folk remedy for this illness people have called a "Bible Bump") or surgery can make it go away,but it is always possible for it to return.  Mine has come and gone and currently it is in the gone phase.  It is an anomaly, but doesn't really bother me too terribly enough to have surgery to attempt to permanently remove it.  Most times these occur on the top of the wrist, though others have gotten them at their ankles, the joint of their thumb, or elsewhere.  WEll, anyway, I had a dream the other evening that I developed something similar on the top rear right side of my head.  I was scratching my head and felt a bump that was getting larger......this lump continued to grow to my horror until it finally stopped and I felt it underneath my hair and skin......and it felt similar in pliability and firmness to my ganglion cyst.  At that point I woke up.  I have to ponder this one to figure out the potential meaning behind it.

      7/7/04  I dreamed that terrorists somehow undermined the internet infrastructure and caused the global economy to collapse, the electrical grid to go down and as a result there was looting, riots, collapse of the government at least here in the U.S., and a variety of other horrific scenarios.    In my dream I was watching the information about this on a TV even though the power was out supposedly.  I felt a fear rising in my throat, climbing up every vertebra in my neck like an ooze.  My husband was packing for us to flee to a campground we visit often that would have their doors open for friends.  I woke up shocked and the dream had felt so real at the time.  This was before the most recent announcement of the threat by our Dept. Of Homeland INsecurity.  I tend to see these announced threats now as a political ploy......especially in this election year.  I fear that Bush will attempt to postpone the election more than I fear an actual attack at this point. But the dream was very disturbing nonetheless.  I don't know how realistic the scenario is because I don't know what security measures are in place on the computer networks of places like the various stock exchanges around the world or the banks...or the government for that matter.
