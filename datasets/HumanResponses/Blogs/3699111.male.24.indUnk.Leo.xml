      Sometimes when you think you may have made a little bit of a mistake in your life (i.e. career choice) and you may have to do things you don't want to (i.e. cold call people, drum up leads for managers to get the comissions on), a ray of sunshine appears.  After nearly a week actually with the company, I have fled AFLAC insurance for greener pastures.  The duck is gonna be pissed.  And get this, I go to Chicago one week from Sunday for a training seminar...at a freakin' five star hotel...for 12 days...all expenses paid...meals paid for...IT HAS A FREAKIN' POOL!  So that was my day.  I am Nate's inner sunshine.  Hoestly, I can't wait to get back to the UP this weekend.  There's something about not seeing people with green and gold cars with big Packer logos on the side of them that makes me happy.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the Packers or their fans (at least  now  I don't, since I fear the Brown Co. mafia), it's just a little overwhelming...and it's still June.  As my new boss said today, we don't try to sell insurance on Sundays, holidays, or when the Packers play Monday night.  Well, I'm going to Legends to squeeze in a couple of games worth o' trivia on NTN like they have at Shamrock.  Since I've been down here, I have made 3 seperate parties get up and leave (as in hand in their game piece in disgust) after I start whoopin they asses.  Not kidding.  This one guy at Legends on Saturday was bragging about how easily he won the game before I walked in.  Me, being the non-competitive type, I merely said to myself, "Oh, it's on like Donky Kong, bee-hatch!"  Half hour later, he's like "Let's get out of here, this sucks!"  That's what I thought! "Oh, excuse me. Sir? I believe you dropped your lipstick over there, SALLY!"  Oh mi, oh my, that got the juices flowin!  Bring it on, you little amateur trivia mark ass punks!  Daddy's got a whole giant Santa sack of "I just whooped your ass" and I think it's about Chanukah time!  We bout to put it down Sham to the MF'n Rizzock style!!!!  That kinda got away from me there at the end.  I'm finished. Nate

      If you ever think your life is bad, consider this.  There are people, whose sole job it is to harrass the mall walking populus, trying to sell mobile phones to people, who 90% of the time, already have one.  You know the guys sitting behind the island style counters. "Hey, pal! How are you doing today? Let me ask you a couple of questions? OK, have a good day then. Hey, how's it going? No? OK.  Ladies, how are we today..."  It's like being a telemarketer, except that you have to actually look at people when they instantly reject you.  Even the immigrants that sell fake jewelry will rarely bother you if you don't look them in the eye. That has to be a sickening feeling.  Not as sickening, however, as my reaction to these guys.  Yeah, I'll try to walk as far from there little cosmetics counter thingies to hopefully avoid this evil confrontation.  Don't tell me you haven't done it! (What! You think you're better than me? Well, kiss my grits!)  And who buys a cell phone at the mall anyway?  "Hey, I'm gonna run over to Aeropostale to see if those shorts are still on sale. Ooohhh, AT&T Wireless! Heck yeah I want free nights and weekends!"  How would that job even be advertised in the paper?   Growing telecommunications company seeks motivated individual to work in focused location cell phone sales.  Must have high school degree and be able to say "Hey!" and "What's up, man?"  Please go to Fox Valley Mall to apply (don't worry,  we'll find you. )   So, as I enter my fourth week of unemployment, I can take some quasi-comfort in the fact that I don't have to do that job.  And in case anyone was worried, yes, I am spending far too much time at the malls down here, but I am seeking help. Big morning in Appleton tomorrow, need to break out and iron my best (and only) white dress shirt, so I gotta go.  Oh, and I'm sure Jamie is scrambling right now to put together a post about cell phone salespeople. Thought stealer!  Kidding.  I'm finished. Nate

      Big announcement for all of you Marquette types that have been saying, "You know? There's just something missing since Nate left Marquette."  Well, I'll be making my triumphant return this weekend, probably Saturday for the fireworks extravaganza.  I hope to see most of my Marquette people. You know who you are.  This was made possible by the EIGHT DAYS I have before my next day of work. Yeah. One week plus a day.  I'm beginning to reconsider my place in the AFLAC universe.  Then in three consecutive days, I have a meeting in Green Bay, a computer course in Madison, and a regional meeting in Appleton.  Yeah, the great American dream.  So, I have a quick question.  Five o'clock is the busiest time of day for a grocery store.  Most people are just getting off of work.  Dinners need to be made for the ungrateful kids.  Beers need to be purchased to drown away the hatred for the asshole boss.  Everyone needs something around this time, and the local grocery store is the perfect place to get it.  So why are there TWO god damned checkouts open!!!  I'm not one to bitch too much about lines, but when you have day after day of empirical evidence to build on, would it kill you food stores to say, "Hark! Perhaps we need a couple of more associates on the floor." Grrrr.  That's about it for tonight.  I have to go to Appleton in the morning...and that's about it.  Oh, and thank you Jamie and Ash for youur kind words of encouragement for my budding writing career.  I guess you should never underestimate the writing talents of a guy who got a B- in Rhet & Comp.  Thanks again.  Random Movie Quote!  {making a porno during the senior prom} Pornstar #1: Prom can be a time when you might be tempted to have sex. I lost my virginity on prom night. How about you?

      Well, my main accomplishment today was converting oxygen into carbon dioxide... and poorly I might add, as the Nate Virus reaches its "Seems Like You're Always Out Of Breath" stage.  There seems to be a lot of this going around, as a couple of other people I know have similar afflictions.  But back to me being lazy, spent last night with Brooke, her friend, her mom, and her mom's friend in a motel room in Appleton. (Um, hello! I slept on the floor! I'm no hussie!)  We rented "The Girl Next Door" on Spectravison (or whatever it's called) and that put three of the four Snore-alufoguses to sleep.  Jamie and I were the only two that stayed awake to see a pretty darned good motion picture about high school, romance, redemption and PORN!  It comes highly recommended.  So, I woke up this morning with a killer headache, my Virus wasn't cured (as Lori and I postulated that it would be if I had a couple of drinks last night) and it was almost 11:00.  Half the day, wasted.  So I went back to Green Bay, showered, and then... crawled into bed!  My cousin started playing the piano at about 2:30pm and my aunt told him, "I think Nathan's trying to sleep!"  At 2:30pm!  I would've been like, "Louder! Louder, I say! Does anybody have a tuba? Or some cymbals? Anything to get his lazy ass out of bed!"  Alas, I finally got up to watch part of Arena Bowl XVIII.  That's right, Arena Bowl XVIII. How much longer until the NFL opener?  At least it started raining, so I could say, "Darn it! I can't take that jog now."  As if the thought had ever crossed my mind.  I will leave you with this.  In order to get a Wisconsin driver's license, you have to prove residency in the state.  According to the website, one of the ways to prove this, no joke, is with "a valid Wisconsin driver's license."  Imagine drawing that in a flowchart: "So you need a license and need to prove reisdency, if you do that with a license, you still need to get one, in order to get a license you need to prove residency and you can do that by..." (Oh my god. My head exploded.)  I'm finished. Nate

      Can you buy anything in these days without being asked for your discount card?  Get this, I made purchases at 4 stores today, Waldenbooks, GameStop, Barnes & Noble, and Copp's Foods.  Every time I checked out, "Do you have your Frequent Bookworm/ Game Nerd/ Fresh Produce Plus Card?"  No, I just want to give you the money! And then leave!  The pimply faced kid at GameStop actually said this, "By purchasing our 'Used Game Nerd Card' (or whatever it's called) for $10 you will save $2 off this used $10 DVD so you'll only actually pay $8!"  No! I will pay $18!  And they throw in 6 free issues of their exclusive gamer magazine, as if I don't already have enough to impress the ladies with.  The only place I finally caved was at my favorite store, Lids ($5 to save 20% on all reularly priced hats.)  Anyone who knows me and hats will know that's like giving a crackhead a Frequent Rock Purchase Discount Card.  Had my first day of "work" today, i.e. I signed a couple of contracts, blah, blah.  Of course, I didn't read these contracts, and AFLAC may now own the rights to my first born child, but if it'll get me workin' again...  The real heavy hitting starts on Monday apparently.  Hope I feel better.  I'm coming down with a strain of the Nate Virus, the one that doesn't make me deathly sick, but incapacitates me enough so I can't do shit.  Gets me all the time. I'm treating it with OJ and left over antibiotics from the last time the Nate Virus was so bad I had to see a doctor.  If that doesn't work, I'm going straight to dippin' snuff, like my man Kurtoris says.  "Cures anything.", he says. The third contingency plan is Vodka.  Let's hope it won't get to that.  I'm finished. Nate

      Spent a majority of the evening watching the NBA draft. Eight high school seniors went in the first round, destined to become instant millionares with guaranteed 3 year contracts.  By contrast, I've been working since I was 16 and have probably earned somewhere in the ballpark of one of these guy's eventual annual child support payments. Also, a bunch of goofy foriegn players with ridiculous names were picked.  It is straight up hilarious to watch these guys get interviewed and say things like, "I am just..aahh.. hoppy that Jazz choices me...I think Utah City is...ahh... good city... ahh. Very hoppy."   Meanwhile, in Oshkosh, Brooke is currently watching Brooks and Dunn. I am Nate's extreme jelousy.  She was nice enough to call me during "Can't Take the Honky Tonk Out of the Girl."  Can you hear me now? Good.  Oh, and I find out Kid Rock is playing at Milwaukee SummerFest tomorrow and tickets are like $30. Something I wish I knew months ago! Oh well.  My cousin Dillon just said something about the "Mr. DePere Pageant."  I will leave you with that thought.  I'm finished. Nate

      So after a long day of doing nothing in particular, my uncle Matt proposes a road trip across town to Woodman's Liquor (or as I will now refer to it, "The coolest effing place on Earth.)  This of course is no easy task, as the 172 was down to one lane, and the detour we decided to take via Riverside to Mason St was also blocked off due to construction.  Finally we get there, through a torrential rain storm, I might add, with an appalling (but Wisconsin law mandated) four minutes of shopping time.  This place is like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory for soakers like myself.  The selection is unparralled, compared to any other adult beverage selling establishment I've ever been in.  I settled for a $12.99 case of Busch Light for now, but it shant be my only trip ever, this thing I know is true.  So, on the way home, Matt suggests that we stop for a quick drink at "The Owl."  I'm thinking, "sweet!", a local joint, I imagine with a sports theme, or something similar. I'd love to get a look at some of the local watering holes down here.  Sooo.... "The Owl" is actually "Hooters", an establishment that I've avoided my entire life for a couple of reasons, including a) my resentment of overly expensive theme joints, and b) the complete lack of "stare control" I usually experience around women with large breasts.  So, sucking up my reservations, I forced myself to go in and have a pitcher. All I can say, is that Hooters had something that no other place I had ever been could provide for me...chicken wings that I actually liked.  They're called something like cajun wings and they are the Shiz to the MF'n Nit.  Unfortunatly, my newfound love for these wings will force me to drag myself, and likely others, into that Hooters restaurant time and time again. Poor me.  But, I am willing to make that sacrifice for good wings. I've always said that.  I'm finished. Nate

      It was officially "Really Freakin Bad Movie Night" last night on the pay channels (of which my parents get all of them, even though they watch HGTV, the Tigers, and one of the 5-10 Law & Orders that are on.)  At one time Gigli, some crap VanDamme movie, and Steel (starring Shaquille O'Neal in one of his poorer roles. Think about that for a sec.) were all on.  So Brooke's over, and she wants to watch the last 45 minutes of Gigli, to see if it's as bad as advertised.  Holy crap. The dialogue was laughable at best. Jennifer Lopez, who should have killed whoever got her signed on to this steaming pile, at one point refers to oral sex as "turkey time" and "heterolingis" (coming from a man.) You've gotta be shitting me! I shouldn't have suprised me that Al Pacino, who's been mailing it in since approximately "Carlito's Way" or "Scent of a Woman", was tacked in at the end of this junk heap too, but it did disturb me. This guy was Tony Montana! Grrr.  Speaking of J-Lo (because nobody does these days), apparently she is not marrying Ben Affleck, and get this, is getting married to/already married to Marc Anthony and may be pregnant with his child.  If only there were magazines/  internet sites/ cable channels that would keep you up to date on this stuff!  Another broad that can't keep away from that aisle is apparently Britney Spears, she's supposedly engaged to some guy that is expecting his second kid with an actress from the show Moesha.  What!?!?  Somewhere, Justin Timberlake has gotta be sitting around going "See, told you she was f*cked in the head."  Is Pamela Anderson giving marriage advice these days?  But the most shocking marriage announcement of the week was that of Alanis Morrisette, who is engaged to actor Ryan Reynolds (of my favorite college flick "Van Wilder" fame.)  I thought for sure I would see someday the headline "Morrisette Petitions Canadian Gov't To Allow Her To Marry The Moon".  Oh well, there's always Bjork.  Well, this got a little long.  I am still reeling from an agonizing driveway basketball defeat at the hands of the T-Puppy, on a Kobe-esque 3 pointer to give her the 22-20 come from behind victory. Ah well. Back to the Nine Two Zero tomorrow. Have a good night all.  I'm finished. Nate

      So, you know those stickers you can put on the back window of your vehicle..."Bad Ass Girls Drive Bad Ass Toys?"  Shouldn't there be a federal law or at least one in the works to prevent people from putting those stickers on the back of a 1991 Chevrolet Lumina MINIVAN!?!?  Saw it. Not even kidding. Look lady, I think Calvin is actually pissing on your crappy van and not the Ford logo.  Speaking of vehicles, I just ended a four year relationship with my 1996 Dodge Dakota. I promised my sister T-Puppy that she would get the truck after I graduated, and because I'm a stand up guy, I'm true to my word.  So for now, I'm rolling in my sister's former 1991 Gutlass Ciera. I miss a lot of things about the truck, most of which being the CD player and Infiniti speaker system.  I now have a Discman with one of those tape deck adapter things.  To say that's the same as a CD deck is like saying a Stouffer's Lasagna TV dinner is the same as eating at the Olive Garden.  Well, I guess it's time for me to finish packing or have a beer, or something.  Random Movie Quote!  Randal Graves: Which did you like better? "Jedi" or "The Empire Strikes Back"?

      Because of the intrigue of an online forum to say what I've gotta (and a whole lot of bandwagon jumping) I'm gonna try this thang here.  So, every legend has to have a beginning, and that is this post. Enjoy.  This week I will finally be going back to work. It's been more than three weeks since I've been gainfully employed, and to tell you the truth, I found it a scoach boring from time to time.  I did just recently pass the state exam to get licensed to sell insurance in the great state of Wisconsin, and will start field training with AFLAC sometime this week or next.  I might not be where I had envisioned myself six years ago (when my storied college career started), but it seems like a great fit for me now.  As me and my buddy Dave were discussing last week, we just want to be at a point where we don't have to take only what is offered to us.  So that's about it to start out with.  Gonna spend the rest of today enjoying the great Upper Peninsula and trying to be as lazy as possible.  I'm finished. Nate

      Sadly, nobody commented on the part of my last post that I found so excruciatingly obvious when I glanced at it again today.  That title was ridiculous. "Things that byte?" I feel like I'm Rodney Dangerfield and nobody had the guts to tell me how painfully unfunny I was on that one.  Moving on.  I read the entertainment news today because it always makes me laugh.  Today's issue was no different.  First story, "Courtney Love Sentenced to Rehab."  I think you could base warranties upon the frequency of that story, "Tires guaranteed for 50,000 miles or until the next time Courtney Love is in rehab, whichever comes first."  And let me ask you something, can we even consider Courtney Love a celebrity anymore?  She was  married  to a famous rock star, had one song, did one good movie (The People v. Larry Flynt), and she's crazy and likes drugs.  That's it, end of list.  Plus, she was the charter member of the Show Up at Awards Shows Looking Like a Crackwhore Club.  Catherine Zeta Jones got to see the woman accused of making death threats against her because of a crush the woman had on Michael Douglas.  Ladies, please tell me that 59 yeart old Michael Freaking Douglas is  not that good looking.   Of course, if Catherine Zeta Jones is actaully 35 then I can fly to the damn moon.  She's at least 40.  Take a look at her in her next T-Mobile commercial, definately 40.  The best quote came from the accused's fiancee, "She still hopes to pursue her career as a child psychologist."  Somebody get Ricky Williams on the phone.  Tom Sizemore's relationship with Heidi Fleiss didn't turn out so well; he's accused of beating her.  Tom, was there anything about "I'm gonna date Heidi Fleiss." that made you think "This will turn out well?"  Survey says... No.  And of course, fallout still continues from the monster split of Paris Hilton and Nick Carter.  Paris wants to focus on her career. That's Paris Hilton, who's best work to date was this video I saw on the Internet, she and this dude were all like... I'm gonna stop there.  I'll try to do better next time.  I'm finished.

      Let me start out with a quote from Ricky Williams, the now former running back of the Miami Dolphins, on the impending economic effects of his retirement:  "People are worried about the future of my children, but a child doesn't need much to be happy -- needs food, a change of clothes and for you to pay attention to him. A bottle of baby food costs 79 cents. I have that much."  A couple of thoughts on that.  For one, does that sound like someone you'd like to have raising a kid?  I'm sure he doesn't actually takes care of the kids, he has three but is officially "single", however I would like to hear some other parenting strategies from Ricky Williams.  Like, "Kids are easy to take care of, just put em in the back yard and strap a leash on em."  Or, "You can leave kids in the car while you hit the grocery store. They wear diapers, for god sakes."  Ah, what the hell, this whole post is gonna be about Ricky Williams.  If you don't like football, stick around anyways, this cat was pretty, um...free spirited.  For those that don't remember when Ricky Williams came into the league, he was annointed as  the future  of that franchise and the pro running back position.  He came out of college with the highest career rushing total in NCAA history and had just won the Heisman in the most ridiculously lopsided race I can remember.  The Saints traded a boatload of draft picks to get him.  He could have been in line to be one of the highest paid rookies in NFL history.  So who does he enlist to negotiate his contract with the Saints?  A guy named Percy Miller, otherwise known as Master P.  Yes,  that  Master P.  Can you see them meeting in the GM's office? "Yo. Yo, Saints owner. What's crackin with these incentive clauses? My man is here in the dirty, dirty south needing to gets that cheddar!  You gotta "Make Us Say...Unngghhh, son!!!"  But, at Ricky's request, they negotiated one of the strangest contracts in NFL history, with a couple million up front and then a bunch of incentives that would kick in if he reached certain stats during the season.  I read an article back then where he was quoted saying something to the effect of, "That couple of million up front should keep me set for life."  Yeah, after all it only takes about 79 cents to raise a kid.  So then he starts his rookie year and everybody wants to talk to him during training camp.  So you'd see him do interviews...with his helmet on.  He never took the thing off.  Remember that incentive heavy "they only pay me for what I'm worth" contract?  It's great unless you get hurt, and Ricky Williams did nothing better in his first year than get injured.  Plus, the contract's incentives were not easy to attain.  I think "Rush for 2000 yard score 20 TD's and then paint the entire Louisiana Superdome" was one of them.  It really wasn't his fault. Senator Ditka, who was coaching him at the time, was basically calling him a fairy while he was playing with serious injuries on a horrendous team.  I'm not even a Saints fan and I was pissed that he kept getting hurt, because it was so completely unnecessary!  Before he left the Saints two years ago, Ricky once suggested that the team move to Texas so he could be closer to home.  What?  You don't just go into your job and say "Hey, I like you guys, but could you move the office so it's down the block from my house? Super."  Soon, the Saints had a comparable running back on the roster in Duece McAllister, who they weren't paying quite as much, and Ricky was traded to Miami.  Not the best place for him to play football, because...  Ricky Williams likes to smoke weed.  In an article I read today, Ricky said he would like to spend more time in Jamaica with his close friends... Bob Marley's kids.  I'm not making it up.  He just recently failed his second league drug test and was facing a big fine.  This was a minor reason for his retirement he said.  I think it falls under "the constraints put on my life by professional football."  He also admitted to drinking a masking agent to cover up his drug use on previous tests.  I think it's amiable that you can have a conviction so strong that you can stare a $3.5 million a year salary in the face and say, "Screw it. I'd rather smoke weed."  So, does he want to go on to a career in psychology, or acting, or anything that'll put that 79 cents in his pocket?  He got a one way ticket to Asia (yeah, just somewheer in Asia, the largest continent on the planet) and says he just wants to have fun.  Dolphins fans are pissed (as a Patriot fan, I could give a crap), but hopefully he finds happiness getting blunted out with Ziggy Marley and Co., while touring Asia, or whatever.  He says he's finally free, doesn't give a crap about money and is set for a life of adventure.  Makes you think, doesn't it?  Random Movie Quote:*  Vince: So if your quitting the life, what'll you do?  Jules: That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.  You know, like Caine in Kung Fu. Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.  Vince: You decided to be a bum? you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be – a fuckin' bum!  -"Pulp Fiction" (1994)  I'm finished. Nate  *- Loosely translated.

      First, I must apologize to Jaime for repeated spelling mistakes involving her name.  Please accept my sincerest apologies, as of course this disrespect was not intended.  I do apologize for any problems this error on my part may have caused.  After all, it isn't your fault your parents couldn't figure out how to spell Jamie. Now on with the show.  Narrator: This is the E! True Hollywood Story of Shawn Kemp.  Shawn Kemp grew up in Elkhart, IN where he was one of 15 black youths...in the state.  In his senior season at Concord High School he led his team to an undefeated season and state title.  High school coach, Norman "Hoosier" Thompkins..  Coach: He was the best player I have ever seen. I was truly blessed to have coached him.  Do you know how easy it is for me to get laid these days? Undefeated season? State title? In Indiana? Shit, son. I'm knee deep in the...  Narrator: After high school, Kemp enrolled at the University of Kentucky but was unable to attain the lofty academic standards...of a state school in Kentucky. Then Kentucky basketball coach, Rick Pitino...  Pitino: Shawn Kemp was supposed to come here? I was too busy looking ahead to destroying the Celtics franchise in 1997, I didn't even notice.  Narrator:  Kemp then attended Trinity Valley Comm. Coll. in Texas. However, he would never play there. Trinity coach, Lou Stein...  Stein: He said something to me like, "Coach, I just can't get enough poon here at Community College.  I've gotta take my pimp game pro."  Narrator: And pimp he did.  Drafted by the Seattle Supersonics with the 17th pick in the NBA draft.  Kemp celebrated the historic night by knocking up his first groupie in the New York hotel he was staying at.  Kemp: She was all like, "You got a room here?" I'm like, "Yeah." She's like, "Who are you?" I'm like, "I'm Shawn Kemp. Just got drafted by Seattle."  And it was on. It was on.  Narrator: Kemp became a force to be reckoned with in his first 5 years in the leauge, averaging around 15 points and 10 rebounds per game, as well as a leauge high 0.60 pregnancy/season ratio bringing his career kid count to four. Kemp even mananged to have two of his next three children with the same woman.  Kemp: I did? No shit? I thought she looked familiar.  Narrator: The fantasy ride continued for Kemp who in 1998 discovered, on a 3 hour layover in Dallas, that he had fathered a child there.  The child had ironically been conceived on a previous 3 hour layover in Dallas. Former teammate, Kendall Gill...  Gill: That one kinda surprised him. Well, I guess surprise isn't exactly the word. More like he was surprised it was Dallas and not San Antonio.  He thought for sure he had knocked that stripper up in San Antonio.  He got lucky on that one.  Narrator: Then, before the 1998-99 season, the NBA players were "locked out" because they couldn't agree on a new deal with the leauge.  During this time, Kemp underwent a drastic reformation. Former coach, that guy that coached Cleveland in 1998-99...  That guy: He started eating. A lot. And drinking heavily.  Between the food and booze and child support payments, he barely had any money left for condoms!  Narrator: And it showed, by the time the abbreviated season started in 1999 Kemp had fathered two more children, by the same mother, and ballooned from his svelt, athletic rookie body, into somewhere in the "Dad from Family Matters" territory. Kemp's career continued in Portland and Orlando before finally ending in 2002-03. Looking back, NBA commissioner David Stern...  Stern: Sure he was a 6 time All Star and was one of the original NBA players to not attend college.  But the one thing he could do better than anyone of his era, was father illegitimate children.  Seven children with five baby mommas? That is a record for the ages.  Narrator: Former heavyweight boxing champ and father of five illegitimate children, Evander Holyfield...  Holyfield: He's the greatest.  Ali was the greatest at knock outs.  Kemp was the greatest at knock ups.  Narrator:  Kemp recently signed with the Oklahoma Storm of the CBA, and will be bringing his fathering ways to small towns all over the country.  He also recently signed a shoe deal for the first time in almost seven years.  He will be endorsing a shoe called simply "thePump." CEO of thePump, Nathan Holtslander..  Umm, me: You've got a shoe called thePump. You think Shawn Kemp, don't you? It's just makes sense.  Narrator: After the original airing of this show, Shawn Kemp had another kid and supposedly had an attempt made on his life. We wish him the best.  THE END  I'm finished. And tired of typing.

      I went out running this morning.&nbsp; Read that last sentence again.&nbsp; I wasn't running from the cops or for my&nbsp;life, I was just running for the sake of exercise.&nbsp; You know what I found out?&nbsp; Two things, a) I'm not going to be the freakish "push yourself!" type of runner (not yet anyway, but you gotta start somewhere) and b) my hip is  screwed  up.&nbsp; However, I did take pride in the fact that I was out there at a) 7:00am, b) after already&nbsp;loading an elliptical machine into a van, and c)  not hungover. &nbsp; It felt pretty darned good.&nbsp; I know what your saying, "Nate, you can't exercise and stop drinking beer!&nbsp; Anheuser-Busch will never survive!"&nbsp; Don't fear my children.&nbsp; I'm merely cutting back a little bit.&nbsp; As I approach my 24th birthday (on August 12th for those of you shopping early), I realized that a few life changes probably have the potential to make me a better, more well-rounded&nbsp;person.&nbsp; That is my goal.&nbsp; Good lord, did I just set a goal?  &nbsp;  OK, did anybody see the video of that&nbsp;car chase&nbsp;over the Fox River bridge (the big one you go over on I-43 on your way to Milwaukee/Chicago) on the news? If not, you can get the video and story through a link, available at  urlLink greenbaypressgazette.com  &nbsp;I saw it on "Good Morning America" and they interviewed the trooper involved.&nbsp; It was simply unbelievable. &nbsp;  &nbsp; I invite you all to check back in later tonight.&nbsp; In conjunction with the development of my plan to bring back "The Pump" shoes (solely [get it? sole-ly? {is this how you are supposed to group stuff inside parentheses?}] to compete with Jamie's "LA Knights" brand), I will be writing a breif synopsis of the "E! True Hollywood Story"&nbsp;&nbsp;for the front runner to be our spokesperson, former NBA legend Shawn Kemp.&nbsp; That last sentence had 62 words in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be assured, you do not want to miss this.&nbsp; Until then... &nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm finished. &nbsp;Nate

      Had another outstanding weekend, just in case you were keeping score at home.&nbsp; Thanks to some well laid plans by my contingent in Marquette, I was able to attended the Hiawatha Music Festivoolae, for next to nothing.&nbsp; I know what you're saying, "Nate, good lord.&nbsp; You show your affection for Britney Spears a couple of days ago, now your attending Hippie Fest USA?"&nbsp; It's not like that.&nbsp; There was some decent music, some hotties, good eats,&nbsp;drum circle things with girlies dancing around a fire, and&nbsp;lots and lots of  drunk ass  people.&nbsp; In all, it was worth the price of admission. &nbsp; Oh, and on top of it, I was pretty hammered my damn self.&nbsp; I think we crashed out at 3:30am and woke up around 10:00am.&nbsp; I was OK until I got back to Rapid and got some food in me.&nbsp; Suddenly, all I wanted to do was sleep.&nbsp; Jamie had told me of her unfortunate visit from the Regurgitation Fairy this morning, and I was hoping that said Fairy had decided to pass me by.&nbsp; Thankfully, I survived the day without vomitting and even got some yard work done.&nbsp; I can puke after just a couple beers, depending on how much I eat.&nbsp; I might puke after a night of drinking, especially if liquor is involved.&nbsp; I have never, and hopefully will never, puke the next day.&nbsp; It's a streak of Cal Ripkin proportions. &nbsp; So, I have been getting to do all this cool stuff while I'm not working.&nbsp; I look at it like this, I'm like a convict that's waiting to go to prison.&nbsp; I've got three weeks until my job at Thrivent starts,&nbsp; I might as well make the most of it, right?&nbsp; I should do things like go to a Brewers game.&nbsp; Things like explore Door County.&nbsp;Things like getting crazy on the dance floor to some banjo music.&nbsp; My motto for the next couple of weeks, "If it feels good, give it a try."&nbsp; I may even go hiking. (gasp!) What have I become? &nbsp; Well that's all I got.&nbsp; Pass the bong. &nbsp; Kidding. Duh. &nbsp; I'm finished. Nate

      I think it is high time that I address a very serious issue to me.&nbsp; It is one that has plagued me since high school and still does until this day.&nbsp; It's a problem that involves a pusher, trying to prey on weakness.&nbsp; It is the problem of people trying to get me "in to" crappy music.&nbsp; Just to&nbsp;let&nbsp;you know: I'm gonna get pissed here. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You know these people, or maybe you are one.&nbsp; The guy who's like: &nbsp; "Hey, can I put my CD in? There's this song by this Irish punk/ska band, the song's&nbsp;called "Flaming Buildings."&nbsp; It's kind of an Iraqi war protest song.&nbsp; I think you're gonna love it."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So you let them put it on, hoping it will make them happy, and it's some travashammockery of a song that sounds like Green Day and Korn&nbsp;collided with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.&nbsp; Of course that's just the beginning. They ask you, "I know you're into rap (because rap, hip-hop and R&amp;B all fall under the same category, but Dublin Trombones have a special genre called Punk/Ska), but wasn't that a cool song?"  &nbsp;  You try to tell them, "Well, it's not my cup of tea."&nbsp; So, they try harder.&nbsp; "Just listen to Number Six. Number Six is awesome."&nbsp; What, are you getting commission every time the song's played?&nbsp; Number Six, as it turns out, sucks harder than "Burning Buildings" did.&nbsp; Of course, while it's playing, they are telling you the entire history of the band, including other "progressive" bands you've never heard of that&nbsp;they've been in (most of which have at least one member who has died of a heroine overdose, making them "hardcore.") &nbsp;  &nbsp;  My plea to these people is this: "Leave me the F alone. I'll chose my own music, thanks."&nbsp; As you can see from my profile, I have a widely&nbsp;varied taste in music, ranging from Brooks &amp; Dunn to Linkin Park.&nbsp; I'm sure the Dropkick Murphys are a great band and if I ever heard one of their songs playing at a party, I wouldn't protest.&nbsp; I just do not want to be forced to listen to them. OK?&nbsp; Are we clear?&nbsp; I like&nbsp;a song by the Baha Men called "Move It Like This."&nbsp; I never make people listen to it, because they would say, "Nice song.&nbsp; Did you remember to let the dogs out?&nbsp; Baha Men suck!"&nbsp; What if I said, "Hey, your band, Pumpkin Seed Necrophiliacs, sucks."&nbsp; All of a sudden I'm too "pop," and I'm close minded.&nbsp; No, I just don't have time to read "Garage Band Weekly" for the latest on some broke band with really "experimental" music. Sorry. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So that's it.&nbsp; And if I get one comment, from anyone, that says: "Hey, Dropkick Murphys kick ass!" You've proved my point.&nbsp; So don't.&nbsp; I will listen to my "rap", my country, my Linkin Park and be very happy. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  But, if you've got a minute, there's a song by this girl from Louisiana.&nbsp; It's called "Everytime" by Britney Spears.**&nbsp; You should really listen to it.&nbsp; I have the CD in my car. Can I play it? &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm finished.  Nate &nbsp;  &nbsp;  *- Song for Swinging Larvae is an actual album by "Renaldo &amp; the Loaf." Look it up. I dare you.  **- I really do like&nbsp;"Everytime" by&nbsp;Britney.&nbsp;

      I got to see our 43rd president, George W. Bush tonight!  I don't know if anyone went to it in Marquette, or how the thing was set up there, but we got down near the Resch Center for 3:30pm for Bush's arrival at 6:00pm.  I'm thinking, "Sweet. Two and a half hours of this plastic seat."  So they had some Christian soul singers up there, then 3 Republicans that are vyeing to get beat by Russ Feingold in the state house race, then a good cover band and then...   "Ladies and Gentlemen, a man who uses politics for most of his material: Mr. Dennis Miller!"  What? Holy shit, it  is  Dennis Miller!  So he talked for a while... and was hilarious!  "When it comes to the war, Kerry's a chess player. He would analyze all the situations until the clock runs out and we lose our turn. Bush is a checkers player: Sometimes you run into a punk...and you jump him!" Just friggin' awesome!  So, I got to see Dennis Miller for free.  Then Dennis says...  "I'd like to introduce a man who knows more about the desert than the Iraqis, from Las Vegas, Nevada...Mr. Wayne Newton!"  Wayne Effin' Newton.  He was performing 30 feet from where we were sitting!  He sang Donkershane (however you spell it) and a few other songs.  That was Wayne Newton, folks!  These tickets were  free!   While GW is on his way down Lombardi St. I said to my cousin Ethen, "They should play Toby Keith's "The Angry American."  And as if the presidential DJ was listening to me, it starts blaring over the speakers!  I'm all on my feet and singing it, holding a big Green and Gold sign that said, "Bush is MY President!"  So, then George W. rolls in (literally. They drove the bus directly into the Resch.) and gave a rousing speach that made me feel good about my safety, the economy, and the strength of this great nation!  I played it cool, I'm all like "Woooooohhhhhoooooooo!  Four More Years! Four More Years!  Wwwwwoooooooooo!"  Good Lord!  It was awesome.  I just had to get all of that out!  I'm finished.

      So, my sister called me today from the Superior Dome and said "I was just four feet from President Bush!"  Then she started to tear up a little.  I must say I am quite proud that we have another potential Republican in the family.  My parents raised us to be good strict followers of the Ummm...Politics? Party.  It's not that they are misinformed hicks, just that they don't get into politics all that much.  As for me, it's like Grant would say: "You're a Democrat in Republican clothing."  He's partly right.  I have some left wing views on abortion, gay rights, and a few other social issues.  I don't however, support a lot of the tactics of "tax and spend liberals" to fund a lot of sometimes unneccessary social programs.  In the end though, my alliance lies solely with Bush.  I did read a little blurb about the visit on  urlLink Fox News.com , and saw a quote from one of the NMU Poly-Sci professors, Robert Kulishek.  How you can ask a Northern professor about a)politics, b)George W. Bush, c)Republicans in general, and you don't include Dr. William Ball?  How?  He could have made a comment along the lines of:   "People generally vote Democrat in the U.P. because they are  stupid.   I don't know what the hell's wrong with 'em!  Maybe enough of these inbreds will be impressed enough that Bush visited here and "Plasticface" Kerry didn't, that they'll change their minds.  I gotta go have a smoke."   I love that guy.  Also in that article, they reffered to the Superior Dome, probably the largest structure, capacity wise, in the U.P. as a "wooden domed auditorium."  Excuse my language, but they play effin'  football  in there!!  They don't call Lambeau Field an outdoor green-colored auditorium.  They don't call Ford Field an effin'  gym , do they?!?!  I think they need to fire the Superior Audito... I mean Dome's P.R. guy (assuming such a position exists), post haste!  For me it was just another day of looking for part time jobs and reading news stories on the internet. You know, this isn't a bad life.  What was that?  No money.  Oh yeah.  Buzzkill.  Talked to a good friend who is in the hospital today for surgery.  She has to have more procedures done tomorrow and will probably be in MGH until Friday.  Makes me feel lucky that I haven't had any invasive procedures in a while.  Had a bit of a scare yesterday, as Matt and I were helping a neighbor move a very large (and very expensive) new TV.  I had to readjust my grip and, to make a long story short, heard my hip "pop."  I'm not sure how bad it was, but thankfully it feels better all ready so I'm not too worried.  Last night however, it hurt like hell (like "only can sleep on one side" hurt like hell.)  Well guys, sorry about not being very humorous lately. I've been writing posts earlier in the day and for some reason, I'm just not very funny at this time of the day.  You'll also noticed that I put some links on the sidebar.  I was trying to get a ticker to work over there with the temperature in different parts of Wisconsin, but screwed that one up bad.  So, go to the links if you feel like it.  I'll probably add more in the future.  I'm finished. Hoss   urlLink     ;-)

      Wow. What a 48 hour period.  I left Green Bay Saturday morning to go to Iron Mountain.  Spent the whole day (and a majority of the night) hanging out with some great folks at Beej's graduation party.  Oh, and I had a couple of beers.  OK. Maybe it was more than a couple.  Beej and Katie seem to be doing very well in Seattle and Gabe and his girl Beth were there as well, so all was good.  Sunday morning, I decide I want to go to Marquette, and do.  After a quick shower at Lori's, I had lunch/dinner with Karissa, a couple of cocktails with Gabe and Beth, and hung with Ash, Bridget and Co. (sadly, no Jamie but as she said "Maybe you could call next time.") to watch a movie.  I then caught about an hour and a half of sleep and drove back to Green Bay...at 3:45 AM CST.  Got in around 7:00 AM, and I must say driving in the early morning is very relaxing.  Very action packed weekend all around!  The one movie that I watched with that crew last night was "The Butterfly Effect."  Ashly had asked for comments about it last night, I decided to wait until today.  The movie can be summed up in one word: overdone.  Ashton Kutcher can go back in time and change things that he did in his life at key points that eventually have a ripple effect, drastically changing the course of the future.  It's an interesting concept and the unexpected cut scenes provide plenty of startling chills, but it is all just too much.  I mean, first of all, Michael Kelso is playing a serious role.  He pulls it out for the most part, but a the end of the day, this is the guy from "Dude, Where's My Car."  It's difficult to get past that.  I think Amy Smart may have blown her last chance to get to Reese Witherspoon Territory and may be making her permanent residence in Tara Reid-ville.  Anyways, some of the scenes in this movie were downright depraved and disturbing and that leaves an effect.  I didn't fully understand the ending, but then again I did doze a couple of times during the viewing.  And one question for anyone that's seen the movie: Did Ethan Suplee's character, Thumper the big goth guy roomate, serve a purpose in this movie?  At all?  Just askin.  So that was a random movie review.  I heard something hilarious a couple of weeks ago, my uncle Matt had vaccuumed out my cousin Dillon's car, presumably because he had got dirt in there from golfing.  He comes back in and says "OK, Dillon, I'm done. I pimped your ride."  That is funny, I don't care who you are.  I'm finished. Nate

      Today starts with a movie quote*:  Carl Fox: You could've been a doctor, a lawyer, instead you waste your time being a salesman! Bud Fox: Dad, I'm not a salesman. I'm an Account Representative, there's a difference. Carl Fox: You ask strangers for money, right? You're a salesman.  -"Wall Street"(1987)  Not a particularily funny scene, but very powerful to me as I was set to embark on the sea of uncertainty that is Salesmanship.  I can do this, and be very successful.  But in the back of my head, I always said stuff like, "What if I have a bad week?", "What if I don't want to pressure people into buying things they don't want? And what if that was required?"  So, as is the story of my life these days, "When the going gets tough, the tough find new jobs."  Yep. I now have upgraded (and I do mean upgraded) my employer 3 times in the last 10 days. I've taken a customer service representative position with Thrivent Financial in Appleton (if you're ever in the area, it's the H-U-G-E building after the Ballard Rd. exit.)  It's funny because after my AFLAC interview, my dad and I were driving around that building and I said something to the effect of, "Damn. I've always wanted to work in a big building like that."  Oh, and guess what?  They pay a salary.  You know, that money you're guaranteed to get for going to work or getting trained?  Not commission based.  Sweet.  However, this does cancel my trip to Chicago, but who wants to spend 12 days in that yucky city anyways?  That also opens up my availability to go to Iron Mountain tomorrow for Beej/Beej's sister's graduation party.  Originally I wasn't going to go, as it would add extra drive time to my already long drive to the Windy City on Sunday. I will catch ya'll later.  I'm finished.

      You know you had one. Yeah, I'm talking to you.  Nobody reading this (or anyone under age 30 for that matter) can say that they  did not  have a Looney Tunes shirt.  Whether it was an oversized Tweety Bird nightgown, a green and gold tee sporting a picture of Taz in a Packer helmet, or even the sweatshirt that boasted yourself as a proud alumnus of Looney University, you know you had one.  Even I fell victim to the trend.  Of course I did it a year after everyone else did, because my mother read the book, "Complete Parents Guide To Keeping Your Children From Ever Fitting In" when I was in junior high.  I mean, everybody was wearing these shirts!  Jocks, hot chicks, stoners, not-so-hot chicks, teachers, fat kids, skinny kids, foreign kids...I challenge you to name one person from your past that you  could not  picture in a Looney Tunes shirt.  Can't do it, can you?    The reason I bring this up of course is last week's discussion about the affect of the 90's on us today.  In the 2000's, I believe all manufacturing of Looney Tunes merchandise has been relagated to WTOA (White Trash Outfitters of America), Inc.  Can you think of anything else that goes better with a mullet or screams "Git' er done!" louder than a shirt with Marvin the Martian pointing his death ray off into the distance?  I don't believe that Looney Tunes have ever been featured on a NASCAR shirt, as the two universes colliding would certainly unleash a force that would instantly put a broken down Chevy Cavalier in everyone's front yard and convert every house in America into a trailer.  Finally, can we quickly delve into why the Looney Tunes were popular in the first place?  Have you ever seen a format of "entertainment" that has been so obsolete for so long?  Did you ever really laugh at Bugs Bunny, that Wascally Wabbit, as he complicated the lives of Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd (amongst others.)  The only real all star in the Looney stable was the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote combination (and if it wasn't already taken, wouldn't Wile E. Coyote be a stellar name for a porn actor?)  Why did it get to be 1994 and, all of a sudden people said, "Jeez Louise, I need a closet full of Looney Tunes shirts, stat! And I better pick up some Jordache jeans while I'm at it!"  Was this an omen?  Like "...then began the thousand years, when the tobacco chewing and those driving Chevy pickups shall inherit the earth?"  I just don't think Looney Tunes are that funny (of course I think Kanye West may be the most overrated thing since internet stocks, too...and a lot of people freak out about him.)  Holy crap. I just saw   urlLink this.    Hey, what's that old car doing in the front yard?  I'm finished. Nate

      Remember the days when you thought there were great jobs out there? Here's one that I always thought I could try out for, if starting lineman for the Chicago Bears (my old favorite team) fell through: thug for rich villians.  Every good villian in the movies always has at least 5 - 10 thugs hanging around.  In fact there is a character in the cast of the immortal saloon epic "Road House" named Jimmy, Wesley's No. 1 Thug, played of course by Newport, Tennessee's own Marshall R. Teague, in a typical Marshall R. Teague role.  These guys hang around all day at the boss's mansion, just waiting for something bad to happen.  And it always does.  Their boss messes with some innocent good hearted people, then Chuck Norris usually comes in and just beats the living piss out of these dudes with various forms of slow motion martial arts moves.  They rarely get killed (or take more than one punch), get to hang out at a mansion, and wear cool Miami Vice-esque clothes.  I wanted that job.  (Speaking of Chuck Norris, how did he not get the part of Dalton in "Road House?"  Casting agents are sitting around thinking, "OK, we need a semi-wooden actor, must be a bad ass and good at magically turning love scenes into painfully awkward moments."  If that doesn't describe Chuck Norris in "Walker Texas Ranger" I don't know what the heck does!  Instead, they take Patrick "Just Did Dirty Dancing" Swayze.  You gotta be kidding me.)  Sadly, a quick search on monster.com for "personal assistant," cross referenced with "weapons training" and "pink shirts" yeilded no results.  Of course, there's no opening for "swimsuit model masseuse" or "late sleeping Playstation operator", either. Damn.  If you all want to check out something wicked cool, the trailer for the movie "Blade: Trinity" was posted on its website  urlLink www.bladetrinity.com  last week.  My boy Ryan Reynolds plays a badass vampire hunter named Hannibal King.  The thing looks off the chain.  Gotta try to get the Gutlass switched over with some new Wisconsin plates and hopefully a new Wisconsin driver's license for yours truly tomorrow.  Six days until the city of CHI and a lot to do.  I'm finished. Nate

      Let's think about golf for a second. You hit a very small white ball with an akward shaped club on a specified area of grass, usually as long as several football fields. It's insane. Physics should not allow for it.  Golf had to be invented by the same people that invented other ridiculously difficult contests like marathon and competitive eating. Am I alone in thinking the ability to golf is a divine skill, with professional golfers being its foremost disciples?  My uncle and cousin are currently down at the 86th PGA Championship at Whistling Straits near Kohler, WI.  To quote Viper in "Top Gun", these guys "are the elite. (dramatic pause) The best of the best."  When he was buying tickets, I even considered cowboying up and buying a $70 ticket for today or tomorrow on eBay.  Then I thought about the last time I golfed with Kurt and Grant and spent the moments immediately after  every  shot saying "Kurt! Did you see where that one went? I lost it. Crap! Over where? Up by that tree? I shanked it that bad?"  No matter how good the PGA pros are, they can't do anything about my eyesight. I think I can find another way to spend $70, as a matter of fact, I'm sure I can.  But my uncle got to go to every single day, starting Tuesday and it's definately a cool thing to say you've been to.  I might, however be going to a Packer game next weekend when they face Duece McAllister and the New Orleans Saints.  Actually because it's preseason, it'd be more like Aaron Stecker and the New Orleans Saints as teams in the league finally realize, "Hey, maybe we shouldn't risk our big name guys at all because these games don't mean JACK SQUAT." But, yeah I might get to go to the stadium and 1265 Lombardi Ave, so that should be fun.  My goal this season is to make at least one regular season game, hopefully the Jaguars to see my boy, Byron Leftwich.  By the way, I am preparing a rant of Denis Leary-esque proportions about the Packers and their fans. (Jaime, I will call you as soon as I am finished, as I'm sure you are gonna love it.)  Speaking of preseason football, I watched a little of the Falcons/Ravens game on Thursday.  Mike Vick played in a total of 3 plays, which I thought may have been a little over-cautious.  Then I saw their backup, Matt Schaub play.  Not having Vick make the plane trip wouldn't have been too over-cautious. This Shaub kid was just brutal.  What I don't understand is this: You've got Mike Vick, probably the most gifted athlete on the planet, who also happens to be able to throw the ball 60 yards with pinpoint accuracy on top of being one of the fastest guys in the league.  And you back him up with SLOW WHITE GUYS! Schaub, David Rivers and Ty Freakin Detmer (yes,  that  Ty Detmer) would probably only be slight favorites in a footrace at the Paralympics.  However, if you are looking for "Backup QB's who look most like they belong on "Kids in the Hall", accept no substitutes.   urlLink       One last thing, on my list of "10 Things I Hate" (or as I like to call it "My Big Embarrassing Failure to Meet Ashly's Expectations") I had included Wisconsin Liquor Laws. Take that one off the list. Reason 1: I was let in on a little secret by a female companion I was with last night: If you drive three miles out to Bellvue, there's a gas station that sells until midnight! Hallelujah! It's right by where I live!  Reason 2: Unlike Michigan, bars in Wisconsin can give you  all you can drink  beer. You heard me correctly. Mojo, of Puckhead fame, took me out Thursday for my 24th and suggested "We should go to  urlLink 'The Bar.'  You get all you can drink beer for free on your birthday." After I got through the light-headedness from hearing "all you can drink" and "free" in the same sentence, I peeled off a draft beer drinking exhibition of Quarter Night proportions (despite the fact we had the worst bartender  in history. ) We finished the night with a tray of oysters (fed to me by a Hooters girl) and I was still able to get up at 6:15am for work. Twenty-four and still able to party like a rock star. Nate, you truly are living (dramatic pause) the High Life.  Oh, and by the way: I'm Baaaaccckkk!  I'm finished, Nate

      OK, before I get to #1, I've gotta admit this was sort of a downer of an idea filled with disdain, laced with just a dash of contempt.  I have just been on that kind of a kick lately.  Things will certainly liven up in the future. Before I explain #1 I have to mention "those also receiving votes."  Honorable mention: X Box, Michael Moore, the town of Engadine, "The Reason" by Hoobastank, Hudson's fries, any movie with Julia Roberts in it (exception for "Ocean's Eleven"), marijuana, Michigan Tech basketball, Coca-Cola, figure skating, Jello, fishing, hunting, deer in general, time between NBA finals and college football season (so, now.), e-mail spam and most forwards, musicals, and the closest to making the list: road construction.  Drumroll, please.  This is the moment where all of Ashly's curiosity will be vanquished. Are you ready?  1)  Hot air hand dryers-  I ABSOLUTELY HATE THESE GOD DAMNED THINGS!  Presumably the brainchild of hippies and the French, these things have been ruining my public restroom experiences for as long as I can remember.  Few scenarios will frustrate me more than spending a minute rubbing my hands under the hot air only to end up using my portable towel (i.e. my pants) to finish the job!  I pretty sure that paper towels are the undisputed champ of hand drying efficiency. Put some god damned paper towels in there!   I distinctly remember asking my mother when I was like 4, "Why? Why blow dryer?" Her response: "Um. They're better for the environment?"  But they're not better for the environment! They blow out hot freaking air!  How does the air get hot? I'll give you a hint, IT'S NOT BY SOLAR POWER! Not to mention the fact that you rarely get your hands dry the first time, so you push it again.  That uses more electricity, which increases our need for more fossil fuels, which will eventually lead to the world choking on it's own freaking pollution as well as putting a Democrat in office. (No, I do not have any scientific data to back that claim up.)  The only humorous thing about these villians of the dry hand, are the instructions.  Step 1) Push button. Step 2) Rub hands gently under air.  REALLY!?!? How in the hell else could it work? Push button, then repeatedly bang head against air nozzle? There's one button and one place that the god damned air can come out! Condoms? NO! Those are in the  other  machine, jackass!  Perhaps I can someday come to terms with hot air drying technology.  In a time where multi drying options in public restrooms are the norm, perhaps I can learn to co-exist with these blowing tools.  Someday, the urge to take a hand dryer out and beat the living shiznit out of it fax-machine-in-Office-Space style, may pass.  Just kidding! Burn in the public restrooms of hell, you bastards!  I'm finished. Nate

      "Hi. My name is Sully and this is my girl, Zazu. We're from Boston, Mass; birthplace of Paul Revere, the US Constitution and... Noommmmaaahhhh!"  I just. Couldn't. Help myself.  Now on to the list:  5)  Commercials-  I believe the creator of the modern commercial, Étienne J. Commércial (pronounced: com-air-see-all, and said with a snooty French accent) should have his body dug up and shot into space, mere retaliation for the near apocalyptic plague he inflicted on society. (OK, so I made that up, but isn't it nice to think that the creator of something so sinister is a French guy?)  TV commercials are bad, but worse yet are radio commercials, because you are less likely to go station surfing during these breaks (unless you listen to country music, because there are 75 different stations to choose from, no matter where you are!) And local commercials? AAAHHHH! I heard a commercial during a Little League baseball game last year and I swear to God it said this:   "It's almost tournament time, and you know what that means. It's time to get that new deck or spa you've been dreaming about!"   Are you kidding? Read it again, and then let it sink in that this was actually on the radio. Or this one, in a jingle from Jack & Jill's, a former kids store in Marquette:   "Girls and Boys/ need clothes and toys/ to boost their self esteem!"   Take that, Dr. Phil! The only way to keep a kids self esteem up is to spoil the bejeezus out of 'em. Dumbass.  4)  Children-  I always hear this argument, "You'll feel different when you have kids." Maybe so. I just think if a child is screaming and more than 10 feet from his parents in a grocery store, you should legally be allowed to clothesline him.  And, "Isn't my son/daughter just the most precious thing?" A wise man once said: "Children are like poetry. They are beautiful to their creator, but..."  3)  The Wisconsin liquor laws-  I'm not even sure if these are actually laws. All I do know is, that the latest I've been able to buy carry out beer in Green Bay is 10pm.  Oh, you can drink at a bar until 2am, but you'll never make it that far because most places have last call at  1:15am!   I live in a town with liquor stores that are bigger than some supermarkets and yet all these fatuous restrictions are placed on me! I guess there is a bright side; I could've lived during prohibition. Ugh. I just got a little shiver up my spine.  2)  The low carb fad-  Remember the good old days when people would lose weight by eating in moderation and exercising?  Remember when people tried to  burn  calories, rather than  cut  carbs? Remember when you wouldn't see stupid things on gas station marquees, like: "Our Gas Is Atkins Friendly?" Remember when you could eat spaghetti or bread and not have some dunderhead telling you: "That is just loaded with carbs, you know?"  Can we go back to those times, like when Slim Fast was the craze: "I just starve myself through breakfast and lunch with these abominable chocolate shakes, and then if I don't pass out from hunger, I eat a healthy dinner." But Nate, that isn't healthy for you! Well, according to the  urlLink Food Pyramid,  neither is cutting out bread and pasta, of which you are supposed to get 8 servings per day! Where's the love for the Food Pyramid? More importantly, why wasn't the food pyramid on "I Love the 90's?" I want answers!  Not that any of you probably care, but you're going to have to wait to see #1...  I'm finished. Nate

      Any of you that know me also know that I'm always saying, "I hate this." or "This is stupid."  So it struck me today that I should write down those things that piss me off or that I think are just plain dumb.  I will not include single incidences, like "When I lost a 20 dollar bill coming out of Econo Foods today." or "My words and actions for a majority of last night."  Just things I don't like in general.  10)  Reality TV-   I shouldn't even have to explain this.  You all know the reasons that reality TV sucks.  Almost all of it is straight up painful to watch. The only possible exceptions are "Cops" and last season of "Last Comic Standing." In our lifetime, we've seen a woman marry "a millionare", we've seen 5 seasons of "Bachelor" (and they've failed to produce a lasting relationship yet) and people eating from a buffet of testicles.  This used to be much higher on my list, but I've finally just given in to this crap.  This is the kind of genre that can make Paris Hilton a superstar.  Well, that and amateur porn.  9)  Democrats and Hippies-  You ever notice that the people that are the most politically active are the ones with less to do?  It's not activism, it's lack of ambition.  They say that the Republican party is for older people.  I say it's for more enlightened people.  And no, by enlightened I don't mean stoned, hippies.  8)  The New York Yankees-  True, there is no salary cap in baseball, but this ish is out of hand.  They pay out nearly a quarter  billion  dollars a year in salary. For a quarter billion dollars, that team should win the World Series (of baseball and poker), the World Cup of soccer, and the freakin Super Bowl. God, I hope this team doesn't win the Series this year.  Unfortunatly I don't think Boston has the horses right now, plus they just traded Noooommaaahhhh!  I think that was a bad move, your just asking for karma to come back and bite you in the ass. Enough about sports.  I also despise the Red Wings. Now I'm done. Sadly, this upcoming weekend was originally scheduled to be the weekend Grant and I went to Detroit Rock City for a Sox/Tigers set. = ( OK, now I'm really done.  7)  Really drunk people-  I'm definately talking about last night's edition of me. (Special thanks are in order for the select few that put up with me after 10:30pm last night. I have designated all recent Sundays to reflection on the Jackassery that occured the night before.)  I'm talking about the girl on her 21st birthday who sings the beginning of "In Da Club" over and over. I'm talking about the guy who hits on everything with two legs or wants to fight because somebody gave him "the eye."  I love to drink and have a good time.  On special occasions like Daytona Day, the day someone breaks up with you, or last night (um, I thought it was Bastille Day?), I like to drink more than I should.  When that happens, I hate me (so as not to be a hypocrite.)  I despise the drunk person who can't put together a coherent sentence or keep balance for more than 30 seconds at a time, yet is still trying to  dance.   6)  People in front of me when the light turns green-  GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! YOU HAVE A GREEN ARROW!!!! JUST GOOOOOO!!!  AHHHHHHH!!!!!  I'll put up #'s 5-1 sometime this week.  Oh, yeah. Nooooommmaaaaahhhh!!!!  I'm finished. Nate
