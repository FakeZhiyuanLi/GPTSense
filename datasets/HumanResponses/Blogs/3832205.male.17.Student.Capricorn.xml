      ANYONE HAVE A COOKIE? I NEED A COOKIE! Haha, yeah thats right, a cookie. Your missing out on a lot, and a great time if you have no idea what im saying. Tis a true mans sport, and girls love it ;).  It's amazing how I went from shit, crying myself to sleep, to feeling amazing once again. Can you say mood swings :P. Hopefully things stay like this for a while again, it's a great feeling wich is always greatly missed.  Haha, last night was a great time Saul. GO KERRY! We need to do shit like that all the time and work on our songs more too, it's a lot of fun. You are a great friend anyone would be honored to have. SHE CALLED THE COPS!!!!!! LOL!!!!    Lol, well this is getting kind of long so im gonna end it, peace. ;)   Quote:  "My pens paint people that ive proven wrong"  Music:  R Kelly - The Worlds Greatest  Mood:  I am INVISIBLE!

       I can't remember the time or place,  or what you were wearing,  it's unclear about how we met,  all I know it was the best conversation that I've ever had,  to this day I never found someone,  with eyes as wide as yours,  I've been searching up and down this coast,  overlooking what I need the most   did you notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be   and everything else is irrelevant,  to the story so far,  a coincidence that you look like her from a far,  is it true that you like to sleep alone?  Or is it what you just tell everyone?   Did you notice that I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be   and when the world turns over  ill keep my ears to the wall  and when the world turns over  ill keep my feet straight on the ground   did u notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be

      Yeah so I have been very confused the past 2 days, and well last night I felt like I havn't felt in a long time, depressed. Over girls, what a suprise eh? Some things got drilld in my head, thanks for nothin kevin, and some things were said at the time by her, that didnt help. I dont know, some may say I am getting worked up over nothing, but what they consider nothing I consider everything. They have no idea how soon my time is comign to an end, and how much all this means to me.         Maybe things will work out, maybe not. Once again thanks Kevin for the supporting words... not.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, it has been a long time since&nbsp;I have made a post, but that is because summer school has started again and I have also been busy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, it is official, the car I am buying on my 18th birthday is a 1998 BMW Z3 Roadtser. Mint condition, jet black, convertable, 5 speed manual, black leather interior, and much more. I cant wait to be driving that around!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have one postive thing, ok thats cool, there are a few other things too that have been making me feel great latley, and if they are reading this im sure they know who they are. Only problem is now, I am&nbsp;not sure about it anymore. Not because of her nor me, but&nbsp;because of my stupid head. So I am not sure what I am going to do; sit and wait, or feel as though I dont have a chance or what. I dont know my head is just kind of going crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-/   Quote:  "We did it all for the glory of love"  Music:  New Found Glory - The Glory of Love  Mood:  Confused...

           Well, it is official. Yesterday I had two meetings with the army, and I also took the practice test to join. I easily passed that, but I am still studying just to make sure I look real good :). I am either going to be an Infantryman or some type of computer job. Most likely an Infantryman. This gives me an opportunity to pocket 30k a year, and have a chance to go to college with it being paid for, not out of that 30k. So money wont be a problem either, since I will also be getting paid about 500 a month along with a yearly pay and so forth. *This is 2 year service pay, at minimum!*       I am very excited about this opportunity, I have been wanting to do this since I was a kid. By doing this I can also finally prove myself to my parents. I suggest this to anyone who isn't sure what they want to do, or are even just thinking about it. It as an amazing opportunity that not enough people take advantage of.  *Amazing full coverage health insurance and other great deals also. You are all missing out*

           Well, the moding of my computer is done for a little while. I have spent a lot buying all the computer parts themselves which are top of the line, and even more of the lighting and moding equipment.       The mods I have done so far are, window X in the side with blue Neon Cold Cathode light, flue LEDs in fan controller, blue LED in CD-Rom, Blue power and HDD LEDs (which are wee not yet installed when I took these pictures), a SAVKA cut in the other side of case where the window isn't, blue neon string under they keys on the keyboard, blue LED in mouse, blue tinted plastic on mouse, and last blue Neons in each side of the front of the sub, with blue tinted plexy glass over the front of subs and speakers.       That is not all I plan on doing, I also will be installing blue Neon legs, but I am not sure when I am going to do that. I will also be buying the 6800U, best Video card on the market, which will be godly :).       Here are some pictures of the mods without the blue power LED and blue HDD led not yet installed (They are now).        urlLink Pic 1        urlLink Pic 2

           Well summer school is finally done, and I passed with a B-. Like every week of summer school, I almost got kicked out :-/. I truly think all the teachers are constantly out to get me, but hey forget them, I'm done at West. Next year I will be going to central because I am to much of a failure I guess :-/.       Senior year is finally here, and I will be spending it with none of my friends. Hopefully I hang out with them out side of school. Hell, I cant even go to homecoming or prom, which is really bumming me out. I don't even know if I will be allowed to attend any of the sport games, if they don't let me hell will beak loose!       I just want to forget about this now, sorry I would post much more, but I have to help my friend who is very depressed.

      Right now I just have this feeling I am alone. I had something great, something I havnt felt in 3-4 years. It's gone now, and the chances of it coming back are probably very low :-/. I still feel my half of it, but the other was left behind somewhere. Sometimes I wish I didnt have feelings, then I wouldnt feel hurt or alone, but I guess it was my own mistakes. The other half wouldnt be gone if I wasnt such a dumbass. What am I thinking, yeah theres so much I want to say, but I better shut up befor I make things even worse.

      I have no problem with staying friends, for now. Little confusing, but I can understand where you are coming from. Just please, dont forget about me and how I feel. I'm always here for you every step of the way, and I hope everything gets sorted out and works. You are an amazing girl, and I am willing to wait for that.  You will always have a piece of my heart.

      A real friend is someone who you can sit in complete silence with and still walk away feeling like you just had the best conversation of your life. And that is exactly how I feel with Laura. Knowing that she knows I really do care, and knowing that I actualy mean something to her. Laura you are the best! Our time to be together will come some time, i hope, but i will not rush that time to come any sooner. I want it to work out, and show you how great things can be.  Love ya Laura!

       I am heaven sent. Don't you dare forget. I am all you've ever wanted. What all the other boys all promised. Sorry I told. I just needed you to know. I think in decimals and dollars. I am the cause to all your problems. Shelter from cold. We're never alone. Coordinate brain and mouth. Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out. I wish I knew.  I hope this song starts a craze. The kind of song that ignites the airwaves. The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are with who ever they're there with. This is war. Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore. I hope you come down with something they can't diagnose, don't have the cure for. Holding on to your grudge.  Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love. And keeping quiet is hard. Cause you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start. At least pretend you didn't want to get caught. We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... in us.  Oh, were so contraversial. We are entirely smooth. We admit to the truth. We are the best at what we do. And these are the words you wish you wrote down. This is the way you wish your voice sounds. Handsome and smart.  Oh, my tongue's the only muscle in my body that works harder than my heart. And it's all from watching TV. And from speeding up my breathing. Wouldn't stop if I could. Oh, it hurts to be this good. You're holding on to your grudge. Oh, it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love. Oh, so let it go. We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... in us.  This is the craze only we can bestow. This is the price you pay for loss of control. This is the break in the battle. This is the closest of calls. This is the reason you're alone. This is the reason you fall.  We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight. I just wanna believe... We're consentrating on falling apart. We were contenders, now throwing the fight.  I just wanna believe... in us.

        Keep the noise low, she doesn't wanna blow it. She stripped from head to toe and then left him with his shoulder out. Go get your heartbeat. It beats me straight into the ground. You don't recover from a night like this.  Our victim, still lying in bed, completely motionless. A hand moves in the dark to her zipper. And a boy best in tourniquet sheets barely whispers, "This is so messed up." Upon arrival the guests had all stared. Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs. No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch, unprepared for a life filled with lies and failing relationships. (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing up.) He keeps his hands low, he doesn't wanna blow it. He's wet from head to toe and his eyes give her the up and the down. His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up. Get the body on the bed like it's flowered and he starts going down.  The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle. Die young and save yourself.  They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up. Die young and save yourself.  She hits the lights. This doesn't seem quite fair. Despite everything he learned from his friends, he doesn't feel so prepared. She's breathing quiet and smooth, he's gasping for air. "This is the first and last time", he said. She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his. He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels like. He is the lamb, she is the slaughter. She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her. Nothing that he touches is really having an effect. He whispers that he loves her, but she's probably only looking for... (Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old.) So much more than he could ever give. A life full of lies and failing relationships.  He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides. He waits for it to end and for the aching in his guts to subside. The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle.  Die young and save yourself. They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up.  Die young and save yourself. Up the stairs, the station where the act becomes the art of growing old. The people, the focus. The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to settle. Die young and save yourself. They take all the taste out. It used to be the reason that we're even, now it's choking me up.  Die young and save yourself.

      Yesterday, yeah, was a very great day. I went to Lauras and gave her the presents I got her from Chicago, and then stayed there and hung out for a while. She wouldnt let me see her room, since it was a mess, but she let me see everywhere else. So eventualy I just broke into her room :P. I had a lot of fun as I was there. I would go into more detial but a certian person she did not have a good night with last night might see and get mad or it may make things werse :-/.  Sorry last night was hell Laura, I really hope you feel bette, keep a smile on that beautiful face. Remember, im always here and always will care.  *Laura has NSYNC and BACK STREET BOY concert tickets on her door!!!! HAHAHAHAHA!    ;)  Love ya Laura ;)  *She wouldnt sing or dance for me :( ...

           Well I just got back from Chicago, and let me tell ya, it's not worth it :P. Atleast it wasn't for me. I would have rather stayed at home and hung out with Laura. Yes for you guys there are a lot of girls there, but when you really like some one back home it sucks. They kept reminding me of her. Oh they are also annoying and like to ask for numbers and give you a lot of smiles. No one got my number Laura, nonono :). Allthough there were 3 girls who joined me in the hot tub, they werent annoying and we just talked about the hotel. Ha it was hilarious, they were joining me in complaining about the hotel. Then I ditched them, haha.       All I wanted to do was come home, see Laura, and give her the gifts I got :). And well that time has arrived, and now im happy. :)

      Well, today was a good day, I cheered up the one person that means everything to me, Laura. I went out and bought a lot of art supplys and made her a huge card, half the size of her :). It was mainly pink, since she loves the color pink, with feathers and colored cotton ball things all over it. For the letter itself I used those letter sticker things instead of writing it which looked really good and matched the look. For the cover I bought this big foam thing which was 3 flowers and bees. I had so many sweet ideas, but I couldnt do them all, I ran out of supplys, so I couldn't even do everything I wanted to. No biggie, the point still got accross, that I truley care, and I made her smile for her first time all day.   *Oh it had white hearts and stuff too, and a design for the outer trim, pretty sweet lookin if you ask me.*  Love ya Laura. :)             Great thoughts to end with in your head befor i'm gone to Chicago :-/

      I am posting because my life was threatened emotionally and physically if I didn't post. So because of that I don't really know what to put, except that I am having a great time talking with Laura and I am learning a lot of things :). A walk some time would be nice, we should do that.  Anyway I want to get back to talking to that great girl. Have a good day everybody, peace.

      Thank you everyone for a great weekend, Cody, Kimmie, Luke, Jack, Cindy, Josh, Melissa, Erika, them other 2 girls, forget there names :P. Anyway I had a great time and have never been around such a great group of people. You guys are so much fun, although I wish her birthday could have gone better :-/.  Last night wasn't the best of night due to some things I herd, which triggered some stuff in my brain that was long forgotten. Sorry Cody if it hurt you. Kimmie, wtf. Jim, ha, don't even try and start, you don't know what can be done.  By going this weekend I know I brought a lot of joy to peoples hearts, and I am greatful for that. I also brought some sadness, poor Laura ;), she missed me so much she left me 80 messages in like 2 min :-D.  Anyway, I really appreciate everything all of you do, not just who I listed, but everyone. I have some great friends. And Laura, I will miss you this week. :(   Quote:  "Can't you tell that I'm loosing myself"  Music:  New Found Glory - Forget My Name  Mood:  I really don't know
