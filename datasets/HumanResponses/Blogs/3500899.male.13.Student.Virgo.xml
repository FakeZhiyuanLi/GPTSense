      Man my computer is all messed up I'll be lucky if this thing even publishes. Let me get to the point I need the info to get an IM so if any of you suckas know you should tell me. And the user name for this blog is iwanabeamofofosho and the password is chicken2 so write any thing you want on my blog, and if you run into this blog by mistake tell your friends about it so you and them can write on it.

      O.K Mr. Rubber Band Man way to go......... you got yourself a blog.  Well since you don't have links, I will put some for you cause I'm smart.  Anyway have you checked out Cate's website?  It's www.theblogaboveallblogs.blogspot.com.  Pretty lame isn't it?  Well, I'm gonna put that on the links anyway.  And I'm gonna put some more.  On this website I'm gonna call myself Marshall Rappers, instead of The Chinese Rapper or Real Slim Shady.  Marshall Rappers

      Hey its me Slim Shady! You guys heard about the guy who wanted to do a demonstration on his masturbation right? Well I heard on the news that a police man caught him masturbating in public and he got sent to jail. I decided to visited him just to laugh at him and say how stupid he was. When I arrived at his cell I screamed. He was dropping the soap everywhere with everybody. I then ran away cause I ain't gay. Squeeze it man!

      So this Martine woman hates me.  At least we got a visitor on this blog.  Anyway Rubberband Man, you better give me an e-mail address of yours so I can contact with you.  I looked at your profile and there was no such thing as the e-mail you put.  My e-mail is at Slim Shady and my blog.  So write me an e-mail.  Marshall Rappers
