      Ok so I went to Brigantine NJ for a week right after school ended and I guess all of my friends like changed there screen names or something while i was gone because i came back and haven't been in touch for a while. Hmm.... Well one of my friends wanted to hang out when i got back but i cant find any one. Oh well... I'll just lock myself in the basement and play video games for another summer. :)  Hmm... what to talk about.....well uhhh.... my name is Cory.....  I love dance dance revolution! ;D  I dont know why the hell i even have a blog.... I have nothing to say.......  I ummm.... I ate turkey the other day.... and i was really close to swimming in a pool but then my parents got drunk... so they didnt take me.....                                     !THE END!

      Blogity blogity blog.....   Well... to start off my blogity blogity blog I'll tell you about my life. My name is cory Hindorff and im 14 years old. Well when I was a baby I was almost killed by various objects.... but Jesus loves me..... so that's why I'm here today..  THAT'S RIGHT YOU BASTARDS! IM A CHRISTIAN! YOU ALL THINK YOU'RE SOOOO COOL BECAUSE YOU'RE ATHIEST OR SOME KIND OF GOTHIC ANTI-CHRIST MIJEGGER BUT I AM CHRISTIAN AND I'M NOT GONNA CARE IF ANY OF YOU SACRELIGIOUS BASTARDS MAKE FUN OF MY RELIGEON.   (all of the text in caps lock only applies to those of you who make fun of Christians or any other religeon...)   so back to me almost being killed by various objects. Iv'e been dropped on the kitchen floor many times as a baby. Iv'e fallen off of my bed and landed on a wooden floor various times as a baby. I tried to light myself on fire as a baby. I tried to stick my hand in a fan as a baby. and Iv'e had a stereo land on my head as a baby.   (that one i have on tape and if any of my friends want to come over to see it they are welcome)  Oh yeah .....friends..... I actually have those this year. I am so proud of my self. I am not going to list the names of my new found friends because im scared I'll leave some one out and they'll get all mad at me.  And so i grew up to be an incredibly stupid kid who still accidentally almost dies  various times (most of them from crossing the street)  oh but i made it into High School!!!! WOOO!!!! GO ME!!!!!  And so concludes the first entry of my blogity blog

      I havent talked to any of friends in so long, and a lot of them are going through a lot of problems in there lives and they are telling me they are going to kill themselves. It is so frustrating because having not talked to them in while, how am I supposed to know weather they are even alive or not? How am I supposed to know if they don't like me anymore? Im worried that Jen and chelsey have been talking behind my back and stuff because every time I want to like hang out with them or something they always come up with an excuse and ditch me. My whole family left for Flordia without me and now im in the house alone for a week. How am I going to sleep at night? and what happens if I run out of food or something. There are times when I try to talk to my friends but they just shut me out. Am I being excluded from the friends that I've wanted all my life? Was it too good to be true? I am alone for a week. I am questioning weather my mother and father love me or not. This is the second time they left me. The other time was when they left to see the fire works without me on the fourth of july. Yesterday when they left, I tried to cut myself again. What the fuck is my problem? There are people out there who have it so much worse then me! I am not going to let what happened to all my friends happen to me. I am not going to let my self get depressed. I am not going to consider suicide. I need someone to talk to but I keep on getting shut away from everyone........

      I actually had a lot of fun at yesterday's Bar-b-que! (Probably because Jen came over and we played video games the whole time) But I had a couple of ribs some chicken, some deviled eggs, and some egg salad (you know, black people food...) It was sooooo fun. And soooo yum! Oh I also had a lot of brownies!!! MMMMM BROWNIES!!!  But then of course my parents had to ruin it by leaving for the fireworks with out me.... and I sat at home on my computer while no one else was online because everyone else out watching fire works!!! But it's ok because I set off a Georgia peach when my mom wasn't expecting it and she freaked out. I was happy then until my stupid little brother ruined it. He was sooo friggin dumb! He lit a sparkler and threw it on my trampoline and now there's a big friggin hole in my trampoline! I tried to chase after him and kick his fat ass but of course my mom stopped and explained to me why he was right and I was wrong.... don't ask. My stupid brother could like kill my dad and I would get pissed at him and my mom would still find ways to make me seem like the bad guy and him the little chubby angel.  So the moral of this blog is that every time a little piece of happiness comes my way, my god damn family ruins it.  the end

      Yuhe brought my friends katy and Sam to my youth group yesterday!!! And we had a jolly old time playing ddr and eating cheese burgers. And today we might go to a pool. And I got invited to my friend catalina's birthday party at dave n' busters. Like, when I tell everybody that my social life is getting a lot happier they're all like shut up we don't care! But it means so much to me to have more than just two friends...... So I'm super happy.....  oh and just to clear this up.... I AM NOT A GOTH!!!! What you wear shouldn't label you. If you're so blind as to only look at the clothes of a person and label them then you seriously need some help. And apparently a lot of people in this world do because I get persecuted for the clothes I wear every day.....  I love DDR!!!!!!  JEN!!!! 2 DAYS UNTIL YOUR BIRFDAY!!!! I'm gettin you a taco......

      Blah....  I just got finished watching Teen Titans. It was the one where Aqua Lad came and him and Beast Boy kept on fightin and stuff. Earlier on "Miguzi" I also watched the episode of Teen Titans when Cyborg builds his own custom car and then Gizmo steals it. Then Cyborg and Raven chase after him. I love that show.  This morning I cleaned the living room all by myself. My mom came down stairs and was like WOAH!!!! Then she hugged me. Yey!! HA HA LOGAN!!! I CLEANED THE LIVING ROOM!!!! MOMMY LOVES ME!!!!  But then of course Logan is gonna do something "cute" and then my Mom with be all nice and lovy to him again. That is so fucked up. This is not the relationship two siblings should have with eachother. It's like we're fighting over our mom. It's so stupid. Whatever.......  I had a lot of fun with the Lysol. I took two cans and pretended I was shooting zombies!!!  Apparently there was A LOT of zombies . Lol. The room smelled horrible. Oh well. It was worth it! ^-^

      Still haven't hung out with any of my friends in a while, and everytime I try to talk to Katy online my stupid brother comes along and kicks me off line. Grrrr, and its only when Katy talks too... I can to talk all of my other friends with no problem but then I try to talk to Katy and poop happens.  I'm still mad at Chelsey. She knew that Jen was already emotionally unstable  before  Chelsey did what she did. But ever since that happened Jen is like super depressed. It is horrible. She is slowly getting her mind off of it though. Chelsey is really pissing me off. She always has these weird ways of trying to make it like she's the victim and not Jen. Chelsey was talking to my little brother online and she told him that she was going to kill her self.  WELL CHELSEY, I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU TO HEAR!! I AM TIRED OF YOU TALKING ABOUT KILLING YOURSELF AND NOT DOING IT!!! I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYONE ELSE BUT I AM NOT GOING TO FEEL ANY SYMPATHY FOR YOU IF YOU THREAT TO KILL YOURSELF!! YOU AREN'T THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION!! JEN IS!! SO YOU CAN GO ON AND KILL YOURSELF BUT I AM NOT GONNA HAVE ANY SYMPATHY OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!!! IT'S NOT THAT I WANT YOU DEAD IT'S JUST THAT YOU HAVE TO STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL AND REALIZE THAT YOU PUT JEN IN A DEEP DEPRESSION!!! YOU HURT HER!!! SHE DIDN'T HURT YOU!!! SO IF YOUR GONNA KILL YOURSELF THEN DO IT!!!!  Ok I got  that  out of my system. So umm.... Someone should call me... So we could hang out.... I'm bored. I have to be at my youth group at one. But anybody is welcome. PLEASE CALL ME!!!!! (call me before one) BYE BYE!

        I haven't posted in like a bagillion years. I'm gonna tell you everything in my life that happened. Ok here we go. Yuhe is gone forever. I am so sad. I had a dream about her. It was the first day of school and yuhe was at my bus stop for some reason. She was wearing all these "I Love New York" clothes and I told her "No Yuhe! You love ghetto garden city". She made an evil face and said "You're stupid" then she slapped me. She grew wings and flew off to New York and I cried. Then I woke up. Well, I guess it was supposed to be sad.... but oh well. I miss her so friggin much. I talked to Jen and Chelsey and all three of us started hanging out again. I havent heard from alot of my friends. But I still had my two Ghetto Garden City friends. We were all sort of happy. But I was still uneasy at the fact that my family left me for a vacation and didn't take me because they didn't have enough mony. I believe that I have a right to be mad about that. What kind of family would do that? In between all of this. My older brother Aaron was still working his way up to making it famous with his band Five Pie. They went on tour for three days. I am really happy for him, but hes still an ass hole. Me Jen and Chelsey were still hanging out and having fairly good lives untill Chelsey went and pulled a really bitchy move.. I couldn't believe it. This is what happened. Jen finally found a boy she really really liked. And it isnt every day that someone like Jen likes a boy. After a few months Jen finnaly worked up the confidence to ask him out and he said yes. So me, Chelsey, Jen, and Jen's new boyfriend were all at Jens house hanging out. And Chelsey turned off the lights for some reason. Jen turned them on to find Chelsey making out with her boyfriend. Jen and I got pissed at Chelsey and Jen dumped her boyfriend. Soon after, Chelsey moved with her mom. Our friendship with Chelsey is over, Jen went into deep depression, and everyone is in shock that someone like Chelsey could do something so mean. Well that's all. I will be posting regularly now. Bye bye.
