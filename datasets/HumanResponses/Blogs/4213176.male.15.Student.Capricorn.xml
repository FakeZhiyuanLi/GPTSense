      Megman anniversary collection and spiderman 2 (from now On im not spell cheking, to tedoius, i fu dont know wat a word is comment and ill fix it). Both are good, but Spiderman 2 is so damn addicting, and even though its kinda glitchy its so fun it doesnt matter. You get this intense sense of gratification in saving people too. 4.5/5 Mutant Spiders. (cant give a glitchy game a perfect scre no matter how fun it is)  Megaman, The game are fun but very hard, Ive betean some of the robot bosses but stil its hard and diffucult too. Hte games are good though even the old original Nintendo ones (which are all but 2 of them btw). 4/5 Charge Shots.

      OK, my friend JJ had one of these loverly things so I made one too, I wanted to get out of the overly goth-emo-depressing environment there (even if a lot of my friends are goth-emo-depressing). So My old livejournal is over here (hmm, can I make links say things other than what I see, ooo, I know how, ii think.  urlLink Here  OK, that worked I hoped. Anyway I decided to link that place instead of transferring everything. OK, I'm going to make an official signout for me and only me.
