      I'm eating again...sighz...will wonders nv cease...my brain hates it's physically form so much it's to flanking up all sorts of eccentric and sadistic reflexes in me. LIfe still sucks...like i say..that's what my stupid brain tells me. Shuttup man.. U SUCK.  Does brain have gender? I wonder... I feel that my brain and my tangible form seemed at odds with each other. I looked female but my brain's a transversite..Can't help it. That's the only way I can rationalize why my brain hates me so much.  I want to look into tommorow without the shades covering my eyes!   Zouk sent me another pamphlet today. Hmm..the Linkin Park Thingy looks tempting.. BUT i'm BROKE...AS USUAL money doesnt only make the world go round..it makes my world stop too. Damn.... wanna go for Moby PLay..but it's over I guess... sighz..a pauper's gotta do, what a pauper's gotta do.. *find sugar daddy!* haha Well, I'll set out my task to look for a sugar mummy though..Men after all sucked..they painted my cornea with black oil. Going to be an usher tom for  church..hurhurhur weird. I dun remember if i ever been holy. I'm a schizo man..I lead double livessss but u know what?  Like I did actually care.

      Hiakz....been eating and eating and eating and..erm EATING If there's a crash course that makes one have to eat their way to reach the final destination, I think I SURELY ace that obsatcle course.  And I gained 1 kg overnight...serious..no joke...  *crumples* oh well..doesn't matter doesn't it? This way i attract less attn and I wun get hurt by the most vindictive homosapiens walking this face of Earth. Tried to do some work tonight but it wasn't even vaguely successful..I'm so very tired... STILL  I wished i died..and nv woke up.....DaMn   Life still sucks...in a montonous dull wavelength that threathened the frail and deceiving stability which possessed an aura of impending spasm of trials and tribulations. I think  U guys know the reason. Life doesn't suck I do.  I'm the foe myself that i could never ever defeat. May the Lord bless my soul. Amen.

      See the stone set in your eyes See the thorn twist in your side I wait for you Sleight of hand and twist of fate  On a bed of nails she makes me wait.. And I wait...without you...  With or without you With or without you  Through the storm we reach the shore You gave it all but I want more And I'm waiting for you  With or without you with or without you I can't live .with or without you  And you give yourself away.. and u gave yourself away.. And u give n u give N u give yourself away..  My hands are tired My body bruised, he's got me with Nothing left to win  And nothing left to lose  --By U2 The Joshua Tree album

      I'm in school now. Seriously stoning away. I'm like a piece of walking meat that was administered a hypnotic. Walking..erm no..more like drifting around in the school. hahah Acting chim again. Oh well, my tummy's feeling very bloated. Loads of air inside that seemed to be having a conference inside. Debating when to stike me with a torrent of torpedos. Hmm.. Why din I get SARS? Would had been killing 2 birds with one stone!  First, School will close and exams will be delayed for people craving for a breath of fresh air AND I can just perished from the face of this Earth! Ahaha...so much for being corny. Maybe God has decided to make things easier for once in ending the epidemic of depression on this plantively evolved Earth. And I still hate myself mostly.. This past year has been nightmare at elm street. There had been wonderous times but after which they gave way to horrendous twists in my ankle-- leaving me crippled. Much too crippled. But I had been through worse times..so why do I feel so weak?  Maybe I've no stength anymore to deal with these spasmotic life. It's like living a life as showcast in Final destination (2) Life sucks only when U sucked. I think I sucked big time. ha

It's MY fault too...I let myself get indulged in games I can't deal with.. Missed him these days. But queerly I don't wander if he's doing well.. More like I was remeinsing the days when we used to be happy together *sighs* But I think it's a good thing we aren't together anymore. Like my best fren says.. we are both hazardous to each other. I think i'm hazardous to most people... serious haha Well well! let the past be past then...I've only this holidays and i shouldn't let it run by again!

      I came across this folder in my hp the other day... Can't really recall when i fabricated this poem but I agaration feel that it's about the time when I was still in the midst of a broken heart. Solemn and nostalgic as it may sound but I like to share this poem here:  Realms of fire with silent flames, Burnts they incur seeps within. So much warth and excruciating pain,  screams get muffled and drown with cynic pain. Something endearing refuse to leave.. Shall it be deem a curse or a gift? as a battlalion of soldiers rage war within,  the land that holds them bleeds and pleads. Numb oh, is the soul intricate pieces of woven diamonds start to wall. blood calluses and spirit becomes worn, like an abandoned dynasty it stood.... Awaiting dawn.  I'm feeling that very familiar surge of emotions again. I hate it cos it makes me yearn for it..and because I'm so used to it. Its like a part of me, like another heart that is built within me. Sighz, nostalgia kills! I'm going to get a life other than this. Ok, I got to pack my stuff now... see ya guys in days...ciaoz

      Indolence is really my middle name.   Sometimes when I look at my parents & myself I really wonder if it's a recessive mutation or somehow I was brought back in the wrong cradle.Hiakz... My butt was screaming in excruciating pain just a quarter of an hour ago...LS too much liao..hehee. What did I makan? Maybe the flower crabs? Or maybe cos I'm getting crappy..alamak. Nonsensical me. Today seemed to be a terribly physically-challenged day. My right ankle is sprained, my left calf has this acute sharp pain during locomotion and my arse is in pain after 2 power dumps. HAhaha.. Hmm.. actually physical torment is nothing yea? At most I just grit my teeth n close my eyes & tomorrow will be a better day ( if not the next, the next and the next day). Or maybe it's capital punishment for my nua-ness? I'm trying to be oblivious to that 5 stack of unkempt notes from erm yr 2000? hiakz.. my mum is screaming at me to pack up.. Bleah. I feel like a man really, I talk like one too..Oh and I THINK I like women too.. Woah. This ain't good news. LOL Well, still I do retain the rudimentary (haha hear that) aspects and asserts of a female, I still do love shopping (erm..I think some men love that too), I love wearing skirts and most of all I still love erm THE ____. (Please fill in the blanks where possible..muahahah-- baby I know u will call me and ask). I'm so bloody lazy..cannot take it. I have to hang my head in shame when plp come to my room and ask if its my brother's room *gasp*  oh well... yea...whatever...now the afternoon insulin surge is kicking in...all the blood rushing to my gut... (or maybe somewhere else? *winks*)  ok ok, too much innuendoes! Zhou gong beckoning moi to play chess liao...laterzzz....

      *yawns* This is so spastic... Technically. I've concussed for 14 hours ytd and now i'm still inclined to my cozy bed. Talking about cumulative fatigue. - Bleah- For someone who freaks out at the slightest increase in circumference of her vital stats, it's such a contradiction when all the labour she does is digest the food and collapse into slumberland minutes after the last feeding time. Hiakz.. I swear my clothes really felt much tighter now. Oh well... I hope it's Pms.. NO, it MUST be pms. haha. =] Ironically as it started out to be when I 1st decide on this blog, I recalled that I was so anti- men then.. haha...well genetic programming always superceedes in the end yea? I'm still pretty cautious inside, maybe it's just too much hurt before.. I missed my baby... -winks- Hope he's doing fine over in Indonesia. I've ceased to be in wonder on how life turns out to be for it takes a course on it's own. Well, well, my fatigue is starting to act up again..time to sleep now.. ahha. Laterz!   Muacks my baby. =]

      It's been a darn long time since I last etched anything in English characters. So much things have occured in the past 1 month (as usual..will life ever be constant). Sometimes I really do wonder if I really willed my life to be the way it has pathed out today. I guess we all subconsciously do. Sometimes in the middle of the day my mind will start to reel on it's own and start to review my own existence in this Earth. God..I realized just how very flawed I am and have become. The worse of all was, there isn't an inclination inside me to want to alter much (ok, so I'm constant in that field). Am I really what laws of nature said about entropy? Being non-resistant to the moulding mechanisms and being swayed in this revolting Earth? I guess I am. Seriously speaking I've let myself let loose in so many areas of my life that the bells in my puny brain has started to blink furiously in an alarmingly perilous level. I'm so resilient to changes in my life now, it's such a far cry of how I used to be before. I guess I'm totally non-narcissitic...I'm more sadistic and perverse about self mutilation. God knows if my liver will still be functioning by the time I'm 30. And yea...not forgeting my kidneys and uterus. ahhaha. Ok, I'm getting outta pt now. Oh, anyway I've gotten myself a totally wonderful guy in my life now! - throws confetti- Hehehe. Hopefully things will changed for the better...Somehow my gut feelings tells me everything might just turn out to be alright after all...=]

      it's the middle of the velvety night and I can't seemed to get some decent sleep. Maybe it's because I'm afraid of what will eventually surface in my dreams when I fall deep into slumber land. The musik of Tracy in The Room is blaring into my ears as I'm typing this. Seriously, maybe it's a tad inappropriate to talk about world events now... but seriously, as the increment in years progress in my age, I can't help but feel that life is begining to feel like a big game that just has too much material stakes. The moral of the story and the gist to the game is just that we have to start coming to terms with the fact inside that, there will always be disputes and there will always be things that left us unable to extricate ourselves from situations that even our cerebelum cant handle. Emotions will always overwhelm one at any point in time. The strongest man will always falter at his weakest point and no matter how beautiful a flower is, it will wither and fade in time. Nothing is permanent in this world eh? Change is the only constant thing in life and stubborn as humans are programmed..it seemed the fact that our genes are the only source of sadism in us. Oh well...i'm getting a tad incoherent again. I shall attempt to head back to slumberland and negotiate with zhou gong. Bless all people who are in sleepy land.. I wish sweet dreams for all of you. Buy a dream catcher if u can...=]

I've been putting on quite an observable amt of weight this holiday and I'm pretty despondent cause I just CAN'T seem to lose the bloody pounds!!!!

      Life is is as ass as it can get. I'm down with The Flu again. What's new man. Yea..and in the midst of my revision for that Pharmacotherapy test. All that medical terms and ambiguous microbial names eludes my puny brain which to worsen the 5-sec memory that I already have, the virus is gnawing inside... making things not any better. Too stress up lately.. maybe its like some pay back time where u enjoy too much and the sequelae is mockingly slapping u on the face.  Ha ha ha  yea.. I'm nuts. I came back home in a cabby today cos I just can't seem to drag my fat body up to the bus and sneezing all the pathogens out from my body to harm those innocent victims (then again I shld rite? Anyway, we are too overpopulated). In case, anyone kena SARS there, I might be the primary person for quarantined. Tsk.   So much work, so much stress.. from everywhere.. No wonder I'm sick. Too much bombardment of shit on me and now i'm turning into one sh**hole.   My baby is coming back later (he's prolly reading this,  must be checking routinely if I update the blog). Heh... Miss him quite  abit.. But then again, sadly I can't see him with my infected viral body. Hiakz. Miss his red red nose and perky butt.   Heee.... =P  ok lah, me got to go and die once again in tat stack of notes.. nites peeps. See ya in sandman's dreams

      Mine mine... very tired... but can't get to bed. Wonder why. Doing the finishing touches..Shsss.. heheh.  My muscles are feeling pretty achy these days. I really hope it's PMS. -cross fingers, toes and eyes- I think the left hemisphere of my brain is losing it. I lost most of my creativity. Damn  Couple of times I used to recall how my baby used to make me laugh with his frivolous actions; dancing sideways like a crab, making queer noises, pinching my fats (Hmmmmphh!) and his oh so adorable red red cheeks. -giggles-  Really missed hugging him and smelling his bare skin. Sighz..ok ok, I know I sounded love-lorn. But I haven't seen him in weeks. Well, though I haven't really forgotten our recent heated arguments ( I   REALLY   REALLY hated arguements), I quite tired of arguing though. Am I really some one who wants to sweep things under the carpet? Or is it that when I'm trying to be nicer and accomdate that it seems that i'm not solving the prob? Oh well... too late in the night to contemplate an appropriate answer.    Think I better head off to bed. My Fuzzy is beckoning me

      Mine mine.. It's been a darn long while since I ever blogged. Jeex. It was THAT long ago?? Really I'm fucking pissed. I typed the entire blog just now and was about to retire when the WHOLE BLOODY blog just vanished. Totally gone, with the wind, a myth, a rumor. What the ~#@$$#@$!?! This morning is REALLY not my day. First, I woke up with the most irritating nose in the world- it's practically just leaking and itching like there's a whole tupper ware of itching powder being pumped up continuosly into my nose. It's been like that the past 2 weeks and seriously, I'm really getting impatient with my nose. Wonder if they do nasal Amputation...Hmmm.. then I would become a n MJ wannabee ( I'm mad! I'm mad! U know it, Whow!).  2nd, My wonderful Mummy is super duper sick. Puke and LS the whole darn night and I was nursing her till like 230am. Then I was woken up by my dad like 8am (I slept at 4am..whaha) to take care of my mum who had taken her territory in the lavotory ealier than I open my bewildering eyes to reality. Have to bring her to the doctor who proclaim that its a case of gastric Flu. Brought her back home and nurse her to take her medication. SERIOUSLY.. I'm pretty beat. I wanna hit the sack but I can't cos I gotta wake another 2 more hours where in between I'm suppose to wake my lao bu up to eat her medication. Hiakz..I tink I better dun complain since she has done this for me umpteen times and even more..=X  3rd, my new bunny, FUZZY is irritating my otic nerves...BADLY. The incessant scratching of his/her ( I dunno the gender la) impossibily long nails against the box wall is driving me nuts. Somehow reminded me of nails scratching across the blackboard(HIAKZ!!!!!!! *SHUDDERS..BRRR*)   4th I'm at it again. I'm thoroughly just stoning and procrastinating the whole damn holidays..Eeehhh..actually for the past half a decade. JEez, no wonder I'm feeling so low. I'm so totally unmotivated to do anything. I dun even feel like learning how to cook! sighz.. I just dun wan to do anything, learn anything, and THINK of anything.   5th, I'm totally and utterly broke to the core. I just spent like $60 the past 2 days and I'm sociaphobic now. I'm so scared to even venture out of my grills cos it means I'm most likely to spend money. I have absolutely NO discipline. I hate myself. I tried. I really tried. I just can't. Booohooo. Sorry baby, I really tried. I hate this.    I'm going to drown myself in panadols and hit the sack soon...Maybe I'll dream of beign someone else instead..talking abt cheap thrill...   Laterz dudes

      Haha...in the blink of an eye it's PASt Chinese New Yr. Gong Xi Gong Xi ( actually I also dunno Gong Xi for wat sia). Today is my baby's Birthday..*gurps* I hope he likes what I planned for him later... Ain't that cheap at all man.. Sigh  Mummy had a bad relapse just on New Year's Eve. Somehow, I wasn't surprise. Having providing her own daughter with a medical education, yet she just refuses to heed my advice on proper therapeutic dosing is such a contradictory. So what is the purpose of me having to study this when my own parents are practising their own kinda of medic knowledge??? Geez, Pissed to the core was an understatement.   One lucky thing was..My dear bought me a looped ear bunny. It's only 6 weeks old now! It's so adorable gosh..I wish I cld cuddle it to bed everynight! Even my mum who dislikes small pets says Frizzy ( the bunny's name) has a really cute butt..like that of a bear! HEhe.. love it to bits. I took out to play every so often a day and let it run ard the house and my room. It has grown bolder and is scurrying all the time playing pseudo- hide-and-seek game with me. Heheh. So sweet.   Sadly, I'm still a victim to bouts of mood swings. Period just came not long ago and seriously..I hate being a woman. BElieve it or not.. My Fucked up pms symptoms start to manifest as early as 2 weeks before the REAL thing. GEez..I'm only like normal almost half the time..other than that I'm in the realm of spiritual and hormonal torment that wun let me off till it's over.  ~@!#@%$%^#%&^$#  I'm drinking again..can't get to slp. Drinking makes me drowsy...nah..more like.. it makes me numb to the incessant thoughts that aint healthy running through my puny brain. Just read Cheery's blog. Hey ger, just wanna tell u that u are hell of an attractive ger and U dun haf to constantly seek for love this way. There are lots of things out there for u to pursue and seriously, men not involved with u in a serious r/s are JERKS and they have no qualms of ditching and being bastards if they have to..ok? I learbt it so many times the haRd way *splats* Hate men who think that women are just used for their vaginas. Damn it. I'm off to dreamland soon. Catcha all laterz

      Well well... 2nd day of the last semester of my life (I hope) and I felt like DYING. Well, yesterday I came to class, and mine you, that was my FRIST lecture of the semester and I was 30 mins late. Oh well, thought I was the only one who cannot make it but Evelyn came in 45 mins late. Haha.. I think we are just born late comers..but hell, I dun have her intellectual genes. Damn it. Talking about my 1st day, after like 15 minutes into settling down and listening to the lecturer talking about Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis, I succumb into screen saver mode. I was practically bored to death. I think in the row of seats I was situated, my note book was the most empty of the lot. Well, it sure personifies the blank look on my face. And guess what?? Lecture ended only half an hour after I arrived! TMD  Same goes for today. I came to sch for a TWO hour lecture which ended one hour in advance. Geez man. And my lecturer was teaching us, how to interpret the CIP structure of chiral protein carbon atoms. Wah lao. That was like year one's work. I'm totally losing faith in NUS lectuers. Not to forget his heavy dose of   INDIAN   accent.  Had tuition 2 days straight already. Erm...actually, its 3 days straight. Sunday, Monday and today. Shack? Let's just say I never used to be so hard working earning money. * Wendy Wendy, you haf changed..luffs* so after lessons today I rot for an hour in sci canteen and headed for CCK for tuition. I kept yawning through my tuition today. Haha... when I headed back hme, I dunno why but strangely I feel emotionally disturbed.. Seems as though I have a lot of thoughts running awry in my mind. This time not old ghosts that used to haunt me, but seemingly my sub-conscious have realized something that my conscious have yet to fathomed. Fucked. I guess my brain knows the answers all along..just preparing the deadful proposal then one day presenting it in flambuoyant colours to my consciousness that drops the bomb on me.   Cheers to myself babe.

      Sighz.. it's a mundane Sunday. supposed to paint the wall..even had a bloodily heated argument with my mum because I'm going out today(supposed to) and I can't paint my bedroom. She was nagging incessantly and the more she continue to rant, the more her fire within got fueled (whoever say me keeping silent meant it will blow over??).   Then   LAGI best.. after I decided reluctantly to stay at home and succumb to her warth, the she tell me.. I dun need to paint my room already!! cos why?  She realized not enough paint...wah niaoz eh haiz  So I slept this last day of my holidays to the begining of the start of the last academic semester of my entire life (supposedly). Now I'm here, feeling like an idiot bored to death. Hahha. Well, something to be proud of myself ( though it's so pathetically insignificant). I started to plan my BuDGET!   HURRAYYY!!   Thanks so much baby..hehe for making me want to save up. Because of you tat's why I have more inclination and motivation enough to save up. Muacksss. Sighz.. I miss him so much. Really wish I could pinch his nose again.. sobs. I miss Fuzzy too..though he's gone to heaven.. sobs.. Sighz..  Can't wait for my baby to come back... gotta pamper him since he had such a horrendous time in Indonesia. Really admire his determination to stay on sometimes. It's such a chore to hear him at the other line away being homesick and being tortured under the hands of unscrupulous commercial employers.   Well.. such is life eh? Like what my blog says...moreever, he's going through pretty tough emotional times now. Sighz  Ok, me going downstairs to jalan jalan by myself already. Maybe get some tibits back. Oh, gotta help my mum transfer her ERS into the account. Bleah.   Laterz

      Mine, mine..it's really 2004. Check out the tone of my speech and you should reckon that it sure didn't entice me. It's officially the year where my nightmare is about to start. Where the future beckons to me and I am officially no longer a student by July. I can't skip my lectures, not do my tutorials and sleep in class anymore..The lives of upmteen peeps lie in my frail arms and shoulders after I grad. *GuRps*  I can tell you, I have forgotten 101% of what I have learnt in Nus. I can't even bring myself to counsel any patients man. Erm, simply cos I do not attend much of my counsellng sessions. Seriously, this speak volumes of how enthusiastic I am in this course. This year deems the year where I have officially become an adult, where I will be starting to work to fend for myself and pay bills, step into the sadistic world where Satan is gaining hold of. Of unlimited bills, pending interests, unsured occupations and bills bills and more bills. The live of a Singapore infant dies the moment he/she is deemed SINGAPOREAN. It's like securing an invisible chain to your ankles the moment u are born and that U have to slog from the day u were born to death just to pay bills, loans, grants and whatever shit. Unless u are bloodily rich which will be the last thing that will ever happen to me. We are creating a vicous cycle of chaining if we continue to be the way it is man. I love studying.. but I must admit I love playing more than studying so which ends up I hate studying cos I will be cramming 4 months of shit work in 2 miserable weeks for a idiosyncratic 2 hour exam which determines whether u can get the butt out of ther fucked up system in Sg. Life is full if irony. When do u really want to be rational? when do u want to be emotional? The rules are just intangible. If life had been just a simple decision where u can be rational and irrational as and when u want, it won't be the fucked up world we are living now.   Persismistic isn't it? I only seek solance from God. For only He makes things perfect out of inperfection.   Sighz.. latersz

      My bf is at my place now...watching liverpool with some team which i totally forgotten. Hahah..anyway, that aside, I just felt so suffocated inside. God knows why. Really. This few weeks were terribly emotionally draining. Not because of what happened in REAL life but more to what is my stupid and spastic biological system and hormones are wreaking within. I'm feeling so much more helpless..so much more out of place. I'm begining to feel a couple of times when I'm totally not MYSELF at all. Times at "rest" were not spent recuperating from the previous activity but more often than not, I'm indulging inconspicuously, the world of depression and make-believe. I'm getting so weak spiritually that I dun even dare to face God. I can't even bring myself sometimes to utter a prayer for my faith's sake. I'm so weak inside. Horrendous thoughts race franitically in my mind and make me do things that my physical flesh have no power of control over. I hate this. I really do. I'm not a very expressive person I do admit but the terrible minus point lies in that this pent up negativity drills a holes within me that only till now that I realized that it's doing a hell lot of damage to my emotinal, piritual, and physical well being. I hate lif ein general now.

      Lalala...  Have had a terrible few weeks.   Now I just realized that I have got to be prepared for the next few terrible weeks for the farked up exams. Tmd.. Now I realized I really cannot fail this sem. If fail then really Hong Gan liao. Choy Choy! God will bless me. I will try to be a good girl. *MeOwWww*  The past few weeks hadn't been very smooth sailing...only just a few days ago. Well, like I said, I'm jinxed in a way. Hahah....trials and tribulations like to come to me in peristaltic waves.   Well, perhaps that's God's way of telling me that I shouldnt reschedule my interview that day to wed afternoon just so I can go mambo. Hiakz. Well I supp to have an interview with this company (shall that mention that bloody name or else it will be so disgusting that my com will hang) on thursday morning and I changed it to wed afternoon cos I wanted to go zouk on wed nite and I was afraid I can't wake up in time for it. Well, billions of banacles, I then just received news that I had ANOTHER inerview on wed afternoon at 3.30pm which is at eunos and the one that was at 4pm was in town. FREAK. Talking abt COINCIDENCE. Well, made a farked up mistake telling the co. at 3.30pm slot that I had a interview with another co. at 4pm(Damn) and can't make it down for my 3.30pm slot. Guess they weren't too pleased...sighz  THen it had to rain. I din have my umbrella and I was wearing one of the few times in my life a long sleeve shirt and pants with KILLER heels( really, I had 7 plasters on both feet in total cos of the damnit shoes). Then, best. MY HEEL BROKE...WOOHOO. And then another spam of bad news was, my contact lens on the right eye fell off. How sway can one be man? Tsk. Anyway, when I thought God had mercy on me for the interview I was so wrong. I was so bombed and so dishellved tat I was crying right after the interview walking in the rain.   And my bf chose to argue with me abt my character then that nite on my way to mambo for the next 1-2 hours and then with both hanging up the fone in a totally exasperated mode. THat nite, I was crying all nite as I was dancing at the podium.   Then, the next day, I called the co. up and ask for a chance of a 2nd interview for the slot I missed from ytd's 3.30pm slot. And she told me...SORRY, WE AREN'T ACCEPTING ANYMORE INTERVIEWS.   *deafening silence*  Eh, dun ask me how I felt. Cos I dunno. But then, I can tell u, it's NOT the first time I kena such shit. And I'm still taking it.  Then later in the day, my wallet fell out in the bus and although thankfully I din leave my ic and visa inside, my cash was stolen though my wallet returned to me.   And later that day, me and bf argued very badly again. He kept telling me how prideful I was, how defensive in reflex I always get and having to be submissive and all that then. All I though was.. I'm in such a shit emotional ride now and this has to happen. Am I really the result of all these predicaments that HAS to happen now? Despite all the ranting exasperations then inside me. I kept quiet and tried to discuss in the most calm way I could. Sometimes I really do get amaze at how much tolerance and endurance to certain situations I have inside me. Well... argument aside I guess a part of me was to be blamed for his outburst and I have to reflect upon myself but I guess it was a totally off timing to discuss it when i'm in an epidemic of catastrohpic mishaps(hhaha!). Was just thinking why din he discuss this when I was feeling slightly better..oh well...what happen has happen and it dawn on me suddenly as God said softly to me that nothing in this world will ever go according to what u wan. U can wish that u had done this, or that, wished he could have been this and that but ultimately, what happens if it doesnt occur the way I wan it? Do I sit and cry and lament and get into that self pity mode again? That was then...suddenly after a decade of being in so much self misery, I realised I am going to shove it back. I can't stop all the bad things from happening at once but I can stop myself from getting myself too caught up in it and think of them as a bad experience.   I still believe in God. I believed still He had a reason for making me go through these even in the midst of all these I never blamed God. Just disappointed. But He showed me the silver lining so soon after all these cos after that I got another chance to get interviewed with the other co. and I was accepted on the spot RIGHT AWAY. Everything seemed to get so much better after that. These few weeks have taught me what kind of person I really am, where I should start changing myself at a pt where I will stop self degradation. I thank my bf though for that time telling me to be more positive rather than thinking persimistically (but he was quite harsh in his tone though..) just hope God will continue to open my eyes to more ways on how to deal with my lifestyle better.   Ok, I have no more complaints for now liao. I got a loving family, a doting bf ( he just bought me a inouvi blusher today..so sweeeeet!) and I got my place for internship. I felt so blessed.   Oh, I'm gg to Brisbane with my classmates on the 24th of May too! I'm soOoOo elated for now. Hehe.   ok lah, got to go and study abit liao..sighz.. laterzz

      KNN  That's the farking thing wif modern tech. Hiakz. These arse thingys are like the high tech heroin cos u get so addicited to them and depend on them so much that when they fail on u, ur whole world crumples n sends u in " cold-turkey" syndrome; the cursing, swearing,   SWEATING, palpitations..well u know the works. I typed like a 1000 word essay on my blog the other day pouring out my lungs and my intestines and then when I hit THAT post n publish button,   MY   FARKING   MODEM   BROKE   DOWN!!!!  !~@$#@^$%&#!#$  I was so pissed. I just shut down when all my applications are still running.  Really damn tmd.  Ok fine. I swear like a guy. I'm just a guy trapped in a woman's body.  I'm suppose to studying now. Got a practical theory test (???) later at 10am. U see the irony of tertiary institutes? I can't fathom the meaning of a PRACTICAL theory test. Tot it's supposed to be a practical test  *lost for words*  Well, I'm totally restless now. Can't get to studying. My mind is at it again. It's the brain farking mode again. Getting too frequent these weeks. Bog me down spiritually and mentally. LaNz. I'm forever now feeling so bloody tired. So always always drain. I dun attend lectures anymore( err ok lah, still got attend but absentees increasing) but yet I felt no guilt and I dun give a bloody damn.  Now u know how bad this brain farking thing is affecting me. I slept like 3 hours earlier on and frivolously, I woke up with a start and scramble to chk out the alarm clock.   HOLY FARK! It was 7!!!  Then I realised...KNS it's 7PM. I felt as though I slept so long, I slept through the entire night. And at that instance, where I thought I'm supposed to feel energized. I was hit by a huge wave of fatigue. I was totally flabbergasted. PIangs.. I just woke up. But I still felt as though I ran 24 KM. IRONY.  And now after a cup of coffee (again). I felt jittery and STILL unwilling to settle down to study. Oh well.. I'm just a pain in the arse. It's always like that. Dun study..yadah yadah, stay up late dunno doing wat..procrastinate and pretend to study...yadah yadah and then that's it. Not prepared for test and then feel like shit after the whole damn thing.  the cycle reiterates.   I tink i'm really one of a kind of slow kuku that enjoys farking myself again and again by my own nonsensical and brainless doings. Hahahah  Din go to sch today. Why? errrr....hmmm.. dunno. Too konk out the previous nite I guess. Din feel like doing anything in the morning. Went to take passport sized pictures for my resume. Damn I look like shit. The picture looks as though I was falling asleep while the uncle took my picture. It costs me 8 bucks. Oh well. Much cheaper than what my frens wanted to do. They were contemplating to go to the digital foto shop at suntec to get their pictures taken. It's like wat? 18 bucks without touch up and I tink only about 5 pictures? and 30 bucks to touch up.    !!!!!!!!!!  Ah, dunno lah. Maybe my priority is not to look so goot in the pictures- Oh well..I just let my natural beauty show.  AHHAHAHAAH ( I also find that a tad too amusing)  Ok la, 3rd attempt to study now. Maybe I will blog again later.  Oh yea! Bf coming back today. Heh. Long time no see him..that poor soul is freaky sick over at Surabaya. Poor thing.. Will sayang him later when I see him. Tsk  Better stop blabbering liao lah. My fingers also cramp typing so much.  tata

      Wow...*knock knock*   i   AM   JUST   DONE  WITH   THE   LAST   EXAMS   OF   MY   LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  -SiLenCe-  This is so utterly unbelievable. Flashbacks of the 9 semesters revision suddenly bombard my puny brain and suddenly, I'm so lost. Eh, don't blame me. This farking helluva long half a decade of my life is suddenly just over. Actually well.. *shuffles uncomfortably*  It isn't THAT suddenly. It was more of..wow..I wished upon my stars as I begged and pleaded, that I can no longer study for the most stupdious, nonsensical, abnoxious and soundless idea that cramping 4 months of work within 4 days into the puny brain and reguigitating the info out as required and ur destiny being determined within the nextg 2 hours of your life is totally ..*BULLSHIIITTT* Life is so mundane and so redundant this way. Damn, I'm getting nostalgia at this moment in time which no other relative or even remotely close gets near to mah mah.....

      It's a hot weekday as usual. Wednesday to be exact. My little fellow in the cage is cleaning her fluffy coat scratching herself. Hehe..So cute. My bf must be busy with his work that he din reply me. Sighz. Poor Babez. He's got suba diving lessons later after work too. Must be really tired. Haven seen him since Sunday. Miss him loads though. Oh well, sometimes a man got to do what a man's gotta do yea? =]  Going out with my gfs later. Haven been clubbing with my school gers in a large group for eons! Really looking forward to it. Hmm..maybe my baby's angry at me for going clubbing later? Hiakz. I went last week too.. But then again, I really got nothing to do at home.. =/ Baby, if u reading this, hope u understand yea? I dun tink I can club anymore when I started working 6 days a week next time. Sighz.   Just login and check my results from the NUS website. Shesh. I call it a head baging experience cos my caps was a mere 0.08 pt deficit to getting an hounors! ARGGHHH!!! SObs. I can't believe I did so shittily for my Pharm Practise. It was really an atrocious shock to me. Wat the freak. Sighz... Oh well, what's done is done isn't it? At least I did my freaking best for this. And I'm graduating but I can't help but feel the stupid tug in my heart.   Sighz.

      This is sickening. The weather is like helluva like a suana. The heat is getting into me. Nah, i'm not IN HEAT. ok, not corny. But it's the dead of the nite again and I'm surfing on frenster for the umpteen times tonite, or rather for the past half a yr. I got no life!! HAha. I'm a internet addict. I'm exasperatingly ignorant to the basics of OS and MS but yet I revisit sites on the Web so frequent they shld just give me a membership man. Haha. Irony is in all walks of life and I'm one convincing walking creature on Earth to impersonate it!   My baby went home early today. Meow..sighz. Wish he wld cuddle me longer. Eh, wait he din even cuddle me today! Sobs. He came and watch soccer, ate dinner, played with Frizzy for a while and watch a bit of Discovery channel and he went off oto JB to pump petrol for the Ducarti. Oh well.. Maybe I'm such an emotionally demanding person I better keep track of myself.   It's so terribly boring man. I asked myself where was I at this time of the week for the past few years? Haha.. Nah, not goot to mention cos they usually involve clubbing at madam wongs( yea, that place is damn happening even on weekdays), la kopi with frens or meeting up with new people in irc or just out being pure scandalous or just chatting with new peeps on the net. COme to think of it. I no longer do all these now man...and that was like a yr ago where I was fervently pursueing these stuff.   Haven had a good nite's rest the past 5 days. Waking up several times and remembering switiching on my laptop everytime I wake up only to go back to slp once it's turned on, or I will surf for a while before zhou gong knocks his knuckles on my head to hurry back to dreamland to play chess with him. Man...talk abt cyber addict, I am no. 1 already. See the extend of my addiction to the internet even in the midst of my slp! Anyway, kept having weird dreams also. Had have them for quite sometimes but usually not in consecutive nites. But now it's more like routinous! Dreams of my baby and my ex bfs, of me being rejected, of me running ard in blocks of flats yadah yadah. Piangz..dunno what's going on in me man.   oh well.. I tink i better try to catch a couple of winks now. It's getting late and I dun wan my biological clock to get so screwed up again.. Till then peepz. Tataz

      It's the dead of the nite once more. Strangely, I'm feeling depressed yet again. Numerous thoughts are swirling in a vortex within my grey matter and I can't focus at all. Thoughts that ain't distinct, more like smeared ink that has no finite context yet they whirl around stilfling you.   Maybe it's because of the fact that I din slp well at all for the past several nites; slping late and waking a couple of times in the nite and waking up early..in a scaringly routinous way. Or perhaps it's because of the fact that I'm very discouraged and dissappointed in certain peeps that are close to me; in their way of dealing with their lives and in their choice of denial.   Who am I to judge? *luffs* I myself is one big walking contradictory big-headed and conceited creature. Perhaps I'm frowning at people who are doing things alike to me that I have conveniently chosed to ignore my wrongdoings but penalizing those as I see the mirror of ers done by them. I'm such a sad creature. Tsk. Yet I can;t ignore the fact that some things are bothering me. Especially about 2 people in my life that had been close to me. Somehow, I felt that I have to withheld my presence of trust in these frenships. I can't really comprehend why I emotionally reacted this way. My 1st reaction was that of unpleasant surprise which gave way to a huge wave of disappointment and then exasperation. It's like standing oblivious to the mice nibbling on the food right under my very nose and I do not know cos' I'm so BLIND. Sighz.. Trust..such a strong word, has seemingly lost its significance now. Trust in what sense? I can't pin point.   Lately, once again, my right side of the brain has decided to revive it's engine and reduced me to the nostalgic and melancholic self I used to be. Doesn't seemed to have any harmful side effects now but I've an inkling that it doesn't seemed to have much of a pleasant consequnce if I allow it to carry on from here. Certain songs, smells, objects stirred up and strum my heartstrings and with that I embarked on a journey of my delusionalized matrix that held me so dear that the reality seemed so cruel.   Sighz, whatever happened to logic? Maybe mine is taking a short break now..ight come back soon..only if i'm patient....

      Just got back from O bar... Had a tiring nite though. Cherry got herself pretty wasted tonite. She's pretty upset after learning abt the underlying activities her arse ex bf did when he was with her. I dunno what to comment too cos I din really approve of certain things she was doing when he was in UK.  *Shrugs*  The surprise of the century came  (actually not really, I AM exagerating) when she revealed to me who she was seeing all these while after she broke up with Normz. I din really expected it ..-seriously-.. Felt worse than when Jac told me the same thing. *Shakes head* There are just so many lost souls in this world..and I thot I was pretty bad. How do I feel? I'm not sure now. But one thing is..I'm pretty disappointed in that guy. It's like a basis of trust that was broken because he became philanderous. Well, he's not my bf alrite but I guess I thot he had a sort of intergrity that I used to admire and now it's tarnished. Oh well... When peeps get emotionally wreck up, they behave in a way they do not comprehend I guess. I'm in no place to judge since I was did walked that path before and I know how it felt.. To be lost, to have no love, to be blinded by only that small dot in a perfect canvas and not notice abt the rest that were perfect.  I really pray all these peeps in my life stopped wandering the lost life. I pray really that they seek to Him instead to within themselves. Human strength is just too weak...  sighz

      My bf just msged me online via msn, saying that he hope I will be more considerate next day when he wants to say something to me... Well apparently, I cut him off 3 times when he wanted to talk abt some warcraft stuff to me. I only felt I distrupted the communication flow when a fren called me on my other fone telling me abt the mortal hat for my convo next thursday.   Maybe I was too tired. Or maybe I was plain brain dead. I really can't remember when I cut him off when he was talking except for the fone call distruption. Initially I felt terribly annoyed and it irk me further when he was so formal and cordial on his msn; telling me that I should be more sensitive. But I curb my temper and try to recall what I had done. Perhaps I was really too mentally drained and wasnt concentrating. So I apologized to him and say I will attempt to be more sensitive now. I was sincerely apologetic abt it told him I AM interested to know what he wans to say. But he was pretty curt by saying:" nvm, tell u next time. I'm tired and gg to zzzz now" and he went offline. Seriously, with that I felt totally rejected... especially when I was really humbling myself and seriously attempting to remedy the situation. Oh well... Perhaps he was feeling that rejection too( I'm trying to be more sensitive instead of being reproachful if u can tell) esp when I supposedly cut him off when he was enthusiastically conveying his daily events.  Honestly, some part of me resents this particular behaviour of his. But I asked myself if it was justifiable for him to react this way. Sure he has his temper and I really do give him credit for such a drastic improvement over the past yr when we are together. No longer does he get so short and hot tempered, MCP, demanding and possesive. I really do appreciate it. Then perhaps it boils down to myself? Wat is it in me that is causing myself this negativity and such mind bogging insomniac phase?    Somehow I felt that I'm probing into some depths of myself that I probably wun like myself to find out. Yet it so paramount for me to continue digging the old ghosts and layers of shit ard my soul.

      Just started my pre reg not very long ago and I'm into my 2nd week of my pseudo working life. Well, cos it's not exactly like I'm working now. I remembered that day when I went for my orientation I almost freaked out at the things we have to do JUST to get that bloody pharmacist cert. WTF. Can you believe that we have to pay a damn $80 just to register with the Pharmacy Board for this training??? And we have to pay another $200 plus to RENEW our pharmacist license every damn year just to sustain our livelihood. KNN.  Sg Govt money really damn hard to earn. SI BEH KIAM MAN.   Sighz. Well, by God's grace, I was granted to work for 3 months in Lot 1 CCK which is freaking near my place. Despite the freaking screwed up working hours, I was blessed with really nice working collegues and my pharmacist there was really nice to me. Well, beat that! My ex classmate now is a pharmacist there too!( there are 2 pharmacists maintaining the shift per pharmacy). At least working there had been very pleasant and I got to interact with my juniors which are in that BASTARD's class. *pardon for the foul lang*   A long time fren called me from oveseas ytd and I was pleasantly surprised. =]  Haven't heard from him for quite a while and the last time I talked to him online, he was in the midst of his exams and some screwed up r/s probs and he was deeply depressed. Glad that now, at least he felt a bit more sane. Was chatting with him online again just now and realized that this close guy fren of mine has been covering up his private life from me. *luffs* Well, if anyone read the previous entries I think you guys know who I'm refering to. Just felt a tad amused by the fact that he told me his gf wasn't allowed to stay overnite at his place cos it was forbidden by his parents when apparently, this fren of mine told me that gf has "moved in" to his place and literally almost cohabitating with him!   You know guys, somehow I just felt that when u become too protective of ur frens, it backfires and u lose not one but all of them. I felt I have lost 2 of my close frens just by being a middle person. It saddens me deeply that my concern has ingrained seeds of jealousy and of grudges in her heart. And it saddens me even further to know the other party does nothing to remedy much of the situation to make things better..it was almost as though our frenship din worth much. So much so for those times when we were there for one another and having given each other shoulders to cry on. Sighz. Human love is so selfish eh? It is so easily mislead. So easily blinded by earthly and material distractions. I'm even more convinced now that God is the only one who loves me son uncondtionally. Who accepts who I am even when I have done wrong. Being the perfect teacher, partner, lover and my best fren. Whatever it is, I think God also taught me a lesson with these 2 frens in my life; as a fren, we can only afford that much help. We can try to protect the ones whom we care and whom we deemed important but the path to be walked lies destined in the lives of each individual. If we do not allow ourselves to fall and climb up again, we never will. Similarly, never impose what u deemed to be correct in dealing with matters of the heart your way for each person requires a unique blend of life. So, never say the person loves the wrong way. For u might not be living the right way too.   I guess I owe both of my 2 frens this deep apology from the bottom of my heart, I sincerely wish both of u happiness and deep regrets for the discontentment I caused in ur lives.    Oh well...   Haven slpt well in days. Waking up several times in the night for the past 2-3 weeks. Drinking a glass of wine now hoping I will loosen up and have a good night UNDISTURBED slp later on. I'm sick of waking up in the midst of the night only to see the sky is still dark and I'm waking up to lonliness.Dunno what is wrong with me. Dunno if it's because of alot of things going on in my mind or what( can't seemed to think that I'm specifically thinking of anything in particular). Just plain sick of restless nights. My baby already complaining I'm catching up in age wiht him. Tmd. Sighz.. Oh well. Hope this drink helps..haven drank in quite a while liao..   Have a good night dudes and babes out there. Muacks!

      I just made myself a cup of coffee mix and add a little taste of Jim Beam in it. Sure tastes nice! Haha..alcoholic eh? But it taste like baileys..though it has more of the coffee essence in it.   Aint feeling good these days though..I guess it sort of exacerbated during my aussie trip. I can't pinpt that feeling..it's like muffled and well I'm slow to react and slow to come to a realization abt anything that I'm bothered with until it's a tad erm...late. What I meant by not feeling goot means I feel empty, perhaps lonely sometimes. I felt a loss in a meaning of life. There's this sort of nagging yet indistict voice in me telling me that there are paramount errands that requires my attn now but I can't seemed to pin point out what are the errands and what I'm suppose to do. Though the nagging urge to attend to them is strong.   Nowadays( well I mean for the past month or so), I get hit by waves of nostalgia at times when I least expect them. Like when the bus goes past somerset station I will think of certain bitter memories of a certain someone. It was subconscious no doubt.. I din will myself to think. Or sometimes when I look at couples, I will think of my baby and I yearn for him to hold me the way they do. It's strange cos I'm happily attached. I dun understand the waves of melancholy and abrupt change in my emotions. Perhaps that's natural; a sort of phase but I guess my other side of a woman's insitnct or the side which knows myself better tells me there's more to that. I dun fully know the ans.   On the contrary I'm not saying I'm worse than before. I'm definitely much better. I am happier and I feel more exertive than I was before. Yet, there is something very mojor in myself; a part of myself I need to alter; to conform and to recognize soon or I will see doom. That itself is scary because it's like the calm before a storm; everything is supposedly wonderful BUT..there's the but; like why I'm feeling this wat? Why I'm behaving this way? It's like the manifestations of the undercurrent in the murky calm waters.   I have been having weird dreams lately too. Sometimes they are nightmares..and theoir frequencies are increasing in magnitude. I sometimes get awoken in the dead of the night suddenly yet not due to bad dreams. But my body just wun rest. Maybe it's my diet. My lifestyle. I'm so dead inside sometimes. Haha. Oh well... sighz... I shall pray and ask for God to show me what it was that I should really do.   I guess this is one of the entries that is closet to me being as honest as I can..

      Heh...lazy me...Back from Gold Coast and Brisbane last friday and haven update my blog. Total indolence man. Haha. Anyway, Aussie wasn't all that great though. It's winter season now in aussie and the weather is F***ing cold! The irony is that, all my frens well which means all the singaporeans were totally clad from head to toe with scarves sweaters, GLOVES( yea beat that, and it's only 14 deg), thermal pants and layers of socks. Shesh, and the most embarrassing thing was that while most of us are shuddering in the climate of the merciless chilly winds smacking us, there came prancing by our sides, those horrendous ang moh kids who are practically dressed next to the bare skin. WAh lao, they were wearing shorts and sphagettie strap tops!!!   *UTTER SILENCE OF HUMILIATION*  Well, seems like a huge mockery to me though. Hahaha! Me and my fren Jasmine aka my small cat were dressed in such thick garments that we were flabbergasted and totally ashamed when some lads and lass were just walking down the street clad only in their Billabong berms and Sea Folly bikinis. Haha! Piangz, that's wat I call being immuned man. All of us dread it when the clock strikes 5pm cos that's when the sun sets and which also spells- DREADFUL COLDNESS. The wind was so dry and chilly.. BRRrRRr. PIangz. Bathing at night was a total disaster call to me. I stood in the bathroom trembling in cold cos I just can't seemed to reach for the bathrobe and my body refused to step out of the shower cos I was so immobilized by the chill! Ah, maybe cos like wat my frens have said, I'm fat free. So well, that's why lah huh?   Anyway, another thing was, the food there is horrendous. I'm not bias ok.IT's true. Whoever tells me that gold coast serve food in servings so huge that I can't even see my face, then I'm going to make sure they compensate for my loss! One Macdonals meal there costs Aus$9.95!!!!! wAh niu. And the fillet-O-fish huh..faint...should call it fillet-small-fish leh. It's smaller than the one in sg and it taste so inpalatable. EEkks! Food and things sold there isn't cheap eh. I tink I spent most of my cash there buying food to feed myself. Oh, have I forgot to tell u that the Singapore fried rice costs Aus$9 there? in a pathetic food court? Hiakz.   Anyway, quite a couple of frivolous stuff happened in the apartment too. There was one night where I was awaken 5 times by a fren's snoring that was so loud, it's erm like a trombone. HAha eh shit, I wasnt allowed to disclosed this. =X hehhe. And my wonderful bew found fren in the trip pushed me to sleep at the edge of the bed and wun budge even when I pushed her over in a QUEEN SIZED BED. HAha... damn funny.   Well well, I guess despite not really enjoying that trip, I was glad I got closer to most of the peeps in my group ( well not to mention the bad side too...A trip exposes the ugliest trait in a few peeps). Oh weelll...tonite must go mambo! I miss mambo.. Only got one more week to club before my ever dreaded work starts. Sighz  ok, till next time! adios!
