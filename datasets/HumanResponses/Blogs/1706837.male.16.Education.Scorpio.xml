       yesterday after our workshop (which is over now, since the yearbook has to be printed Monday, even though there is another workshop day on Tuesday), i found Pam (couldn't find Sarah) and we dyed my hair red :D..... it looks awesome (its like red/orange/pink, depending on the lighting.... it matches my shirt today!)   last night was the Recycled Material Fashion Show.... we were "VIPs" because we were in the first 8 to go in, so we got to sit on the stage like dorks while everyone looked at us going "why are you up there??" .... at least we got chairs! LOL..... some of the costumes sucked, but some were really good.... the best was Tamar's... shes awesome (i took a picture... if it turns out, ill show YOU the picture)   this morning Chris locked himself out of his room, for a long time, before anyone else was awake, and he was too wuss to knock on our animateur's door to get it unlocked. when i went for my shower, he was standing there in the hall and scared the crap out of me (i couldnt hear anyone on the floor at all).... he could have just knocked on&nbsp;my stupid door and not stood outside like an idiot for an hour and a half!!   this morning during breakfast, we could see all the teachers wearing their pyjamas in a&nbsp;room with a clear door (thus giving&nbsp;us an opportunity to see&nbsp;them LOL). i figured that all the teachers would be late for class and pretend that the had slept in, and of course, i was right! LOL.... it turned out though, that since they had slept in, they hadn't planned a lesson, so it was us that had to teach the class. i started us off by playing a game called Psychologue (psychologist) where everybody does something due ot their "illness" and one person has to guess what the illness is by asking questions. it was difficult to explain in french, just because people kept interupting me (AMANDA W!)&nbsp;... it was so badly played though, because the person guessing what we were doing was&nbsp;Anastasia H (the crazy one)&nbsp;(we would always answer for the person to our left. if i was wearing a red shirt and the person to the left was wearing green, i would said that i am wearing green.)&nbsp; at the end of the game, she said i didnt explain her role well enough to her, but i had explained it in ENGLISH because we were out in the hall and she had no clue what i was saying in French. i told people that and they laughed because everyone thinks shes crazy LOL   thats about it... the rest of the day is free... tonight we are going on a ghost walk through Vieux Qu√©bec (and we are going to see if we can stay there when its over, because we dont have time to take the bus back to the campus, then the city bus back to Quebec, then BACK to the campus lol)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomorrow we are going to the Biodome in Montreal (i love it there... so many cool animals)... thats it for now, i dont know if ill get the internet or not next week (im sure i will)... Au revoir!

      first of all, i will start off by saying goodbye to Jessica from Newfoundland. She laft LAST Tuesday because she wasn't having a good time here, but i kept forgetting to add that in here LOL. She was nice, she was in my workshop, she shouldn't have left... i would regret it forever if i did!  on Tuesday, i went to Wal*Mart with Sarah, Jodie, Amanda M., Matt, and Chris. we got our pictures developped and then did some wandering. About half an hour before we had to be at the bus stop, Jodie and Amanda went ahead, Sarah and I went to the dollar store to buy candy, and Matt and Chris stayed at the Wal*Mart doors where we had all been sitting. Sarah and I left the dollar store and went to the bus stop, but then i decided that i should see if Chris and Matt were on their way because there was only 10 minutes until the bus came. They were not at the Wal*Mart doors, so i went back to the bus stop. Being the incredibly nice person that i am, when the bus came i decided to stick around and look for them while everyone else went back (it was 8:20, the next bus was at 9:55).... it turns out that they got on at a different stop (idiots) so i had an extra hour and a half at the Wal*Mart/Business Depot/movie theaters area. i found Allison, Laura-Ann, and Mike though, so i had people to talk to... and i wasnt stuck at the campus all night, so i was happy!.... i got back to the campus at 10:20, and i didnt find Matt until almost 11 (i was back and forth between the two buildings several times... people kept sayign "i think i saw them THERE")... oh well, like i said, i had a night out and they didnt LOL  yesterday was Commando... a giant game of capture the flag that covered the entire campus and was VERY confusing... each team had a huge zone and had to hide their flag, but you didnt know which team was tryign to get your flag (only one team was trying to get yours)... everyone had a straw (all different lengths) and if you touched anyone, you compared straws, and the long straw got to take the short straw to jail until someone from that person's team got a straw to get you out of jail. the mauve team was after our flag and they got it twice (the game lasted an hour, so it was to see how many times you could get it) ... we were looking for the orange flag but never found it, because apparently it was in a bag in a garbage can (cheaters!)... anyway, GO WHITE TEAM!  after that, i found Sarah and Pam and we bleached my hair, with the stuff i bought at Wal*Mart the night before. Sarah did it (her first time) and its pretty good... there a a few roots, but not much, and one screwed up sideburn (its like blond on one side and brown on the other... a perfect line dividing it up the center!!!).... i hate my hair because it looks ugly (it looked SO COOL when it was wet though... like white fire!).... i clal it a peachy colour, but Jon says its "strawberry blond"... i hate it... it seems to attract the gay guys (which there are a lot of here). ... but tomorrow afternoon that will end when Pam dyes it red for me :D (and i am going to redo her pink!... that should be interresting!)  last night, we went to see fireworks. from July 24-August 11, there is an international frieworks display at Chutes Montmorency (meaning i could have skipped the all day trip there! lol).... we got to see Canada's fireworks last night, and it was amazing.... it was also the first time ive ever seen them to music. i was SO happy that we got to go.   i forgot to mention the music people (i think). For two weeks (our last two weeks) there are all kinds of people here for some music camp/performance thing. they are mostly from China, Taiwan, etc., and it is bizarre, because most of them dont speak English OR FRENCH... also, although they are in the third residence (none of the French pragram students are) some families are staying in the large rooms in my residence, so there are two families with young girls on our floor, which is weird. they are all very annoying and dont really respect the fact that we actually came here for a purpose... yesterday when i was in line for supper, there was a large group of them ahead of me. When the guy asked for the next person to give an order, after waiting a minute to see if they were all done, i started to ask. All of a sudden, this boy (probably 10) screamed the creepiest, shrillest scream any boy could ever scream, and was like "no its my turn!"... so, he ordered at Hamburger Trio (meal) and then i ordered my Cheeseburger with bacon trio. they give you the cup to get your drink while you wait (the buy didnt know that obviously) and so i went and got my Coke (stupid cafeteria was out of root beer lol) and i went back and put it on my tray. at this point, i didnt know what the kid had ordered, so when&nbsp;the cafeteria girl&nbsp;asked for the person who got the cheeseburger to say what they want on it, the boy took forever in chinese to say what he wanted, and there was lots of pointing, and then the girl put the cheeseburger on the tray with my drink and he took it and left. i then had to tell the girl (who i talk to all the time, cuz the caf people are nice) that the stupid kid took my food... she felt so bad and made me a new one (obviously) and we discussed how hard it is for the cafeteria people to deal with all the people that cant speak French, or even English. i feel so bad for them!  anyway, im almost done... today in class we had to do a project where we were in groups of three, and each group has a person who can speak a third language (3 Cantonese, 1 Russian, Ukranian, Indian)... i was with Feona who speaks Cantonese, and Simone. we had to be french interviewers, but the third person had to talk only in their language, and then we had to make up what they were saying in french... it was very funny!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best part was when Feona taught me how to say "lay pat pat ho dai" which means "you have a big butt" LOL  ok, thats all... going to eat lunch now. Au revoir!

      last night, the MANDITORY activity was an hour and a half of the Dating Game.... six people (who can speak french well) were *randomly* picked throughout the day and were given personalities. that right there makes it not as fun, because things have been predetermined. it was still better than Family Feud last week though, because at least there was audience participation (we got to shout things like&nbsp;AHHH! and YARCK! *no one know what on earth yarck means lol*). after that, we went to the games room where we sat and listened to Chris play the piano. i think ive heard him play the same songs (since he's learning them) so much that I could just about play them, and i dont know anything about music LOL. i dont bother me to listen to him practice though, cuz sometimes you just need to relax, and hes REALLY good. when we got back to the residence, i noticed that my bus pass and internet pass were in my mailbox... i dont know how on earth they got there, because im POSITIVE i put them in my wallet, but i got them back, so im happy!  today in class, we did the verb tense Subjunctif Present.... me and the other Mike in my class were the only ones who had NEVER seen it before,&nbsp;but its hard so we didnt feel stupid. And then when the teacher said she would make photocopies of practice sheets for us, everyone else said they wanted them too, so apparently even the people who know it dont know it! :)  thats all i have for today... slightly less than yesterday. i think we're going to Wal*Mart this evening to purchase things we need, and to develope more pictures. now its off to lunch, cuz i only have an hour before workshop time! Au revoir!

       busy weekend...    &nbsp;  FRIDAY: we went to see Spiderman 2. i already saw it before i came, but it was just as good the second time.    &nbsp;  SATURDAY: got up very early (half an hour earlier than i meant to, by accident LOL) to eat breakfast and leave by 8:30. we then rode the bus for three hours, and then had an hour and a half to eat lunch and sit around. then, we finally got on the boat, and our whale trip began. after about ten minutes, we were amazed by the little parts of the backs of whales that we could see, but then after about an hour, i decided to listen to the lady that was speaking over the loudspeaker *yes i said speaker twice in a row and i didnt like it lol*... apparently there were two whales at the front of the boat, so we went up there (with everybody else). just after we got there, the two whales (of the Humpback variety) started jumping completely out of the water, and they were rolling over and doing all kinds of things. the lady said that this was the first time the whales had done this this year, and i dont know if its true or not, but thats still cool LOL. so, we got lots of pictures of the whales (i dont know how close up they will be, since they are with an unzooming disposable camera lol.... they were REALLY close to the boat though, so you never know). On the way back, the lady was telling some story about the Saint Lawrence River, and since its french first then english, i wasnt really listening (i didnt plan on hearing either version, since i was just having a good time looking at things) but when the french version was over and the english version started, i turned to Jodie and said "didnt she JUST tell this story in english!?!?!".... i must really be getting good at french, because without even paying attention, i had completely translated the french version into english!.....&nbsp; on the way home, the bus driver was playing crazy music (ALL the bus drivers here play crazy english music) and it was all disco songs, so any time we knew a song, we would sing and it was so much fun... go Disco Bus!    &nbsp;  SUNDAY:&nbsp;i woke up at 9:30 and even though i had a nothing day, i couldnt go back to sleep so i read for a while. at 10:20, Chris came to my room to find out what time it was, and what time he was supposed to leav at (almost everybody was going to this outdoor sports place at 12... i didnt cuz it didnt interest me).... anyway, this is just a small part of Chris's goal of not using a clock or watch of his own (since he didnt BRING one) for five weeks. after that, i went for lunch at 11:30, just in time to see everybody before they left for the day. i sat in the cafeteria with Pam and Young Megan for 2.5 hours, then we went to do my laundry. this successfully wasted time until 4, at which point Pam and i went to play pool for an hour, and then we ate supper. after that, i went to this music store with Chris, Sarah, Matt, and Irina where we spent a good half hour. Sarah and I waited for the second bus to come&nbsp;when we had to switch&nbsp;buses since the other one was PACKED (everyone here tries to go to the same place at once, so we fill buses easily), and since we didnt know if we were going to the music store or Vieux Quebec first, so the other three were waiting at the bus stop at the music store when we got there, but they didnt motion for us to get off the bus, and they didnt try to get on the bus. so me and Sarah ran to the back door, but the bus driver didnt open it, and we got shipped off to the next bus stop at Laval University. then we had to wait for a bus to take us back, but after that everything was good. when we left the store, Matt needed&nbsp; to go to the bank, so we took the bus all the way to Vieux Quebec just so he could save 50 cents by not using the machine at the campus LOL. while we were there, we just looked around for a few minutes, talked to a man who was visiting from New Jersey (he took our picture) and then we went back. since we still had an hour to wait when we got off our first bus (because the second bus runs rarely) we walked to Tim Hortons :D (my third time since we got here!)    &nbsp;  TODAY: this afternoon, we went on a class trip to the Chateau Frontenac, which i think was the best trip out of all the trips classes went on today. we got a guided tour buy a "maid".... it is SO nice there.... the sand in the ashtrays has has a fancy F stamped into it, its just that fancy LOL. we got to go in a Presidential Suite... i could have dealt with living there! (since the bed alone is about half the size of ours rooms here LOL)... it was interesting, but it was over quickly. oh well, it beats the trips of the other classes!    &nbsp;  thats all for today... if i type any more i might die LOL. au revoir!

       to start off, i will add something that i forget to say, from our Wal*Mart experience. while we were waiting for the bus, i decided to wave at every car thsat drove by, to see what the people would do. i recieved the following:   45 waves   4 head nods   2 really big smiles (a smile had to be of a certain size, and not contain a hand wave, to be considered an actual, seperate&nbsp;gesture)   1 salute   1 middle finger    &nbsp;  now, on to the Disco dance from last night.... it was better that i thought it would be... somewhere in the middle the music changed from disco to "urban", which was equally terrible, but near the end they threw in a few good songs, so i was happy (and people got to hear my wonderful singing voice!)..... the gym was SOOO HOTTT, and everyone was soaked with sweat, then when we left it felt great to be outside in the cool air, but then it started to pour within seconds, so we went from wet and boiling to wet and freezing LOL. the best part of the night was the fact that they had TWO of those big red jug thingys full of   MacDonalds Orange Drink!   That stuff is SOOO good!    &nbsp;  since i was sweaty and wet and cold and gross, i had a shower before i went to bed, and its a good thing i did, because this morning when my alarm went off at 7, i just turned it off, went back to bed, and slept until 7:45 (which is the time that we meet for breakfast.... i was there for 8 LOL)    &nbsp;  today in class, my oral presentation with Amanda M. went fairly well... we never actually read off the paper while we were saying our lines, os thats good LOL. also, the Amandas and I have taken complete control over our part of the class project to be presented to the rest of the students, and its REALLY good (the best of the three groups in our class)... we have all kinds of jokes, some of them being of the "inside" variety, of course.    &nbsp;  today is free time (after classes ended at 12) so we are doing nothing, and then we are going to see Spiderman 2 (i saw it before i came here, but its good enough to see again!)    tomorrow we are going whale watching, so i wont be here to talk, and sunday the computer room is closed (i will be doing my laundry)   thats all for now i guess. all you people in Renfrew, have fun at Valleyfest this weekend! Au revir!

       yesterday afternoon was Kermesse, which is "fair", as in, im going to the fair. it was SO hot, and it was just a bunch of games that were practically impossible to win... i won ONE coupon at a darts game (and i had to play it a&nbsp;billion times to get that one... stupid little stars&nbsp;LOL)... people who had 20 coupons at the end could smear Cool Whip on the animateurs, and i was about 19 coupons short lol. after it was over though, i found this huge glob of Cool Whip on the ground, so i scooped it up and smeared it in Mathieu's hair.. it was HILLARIOUS, especially since he was bent down trying to clean himself off from previous attacks at the time lol... then, like the good little boys and girls that we are, we helped clean everything up. we're so nice. LOL    &nbsp;  so, last night after supper, me, Jodie, Sarah, Pam, and Amanda M. went to Wal*Mart (i like to put in the *... its fun that way lol). we all had pictures to get developped, accept for Amanda. Pam had a huge stack of pictures... they were AT LEAST 2 inches thick... she got all of her digital camera pictures done, thats why lol. most of my pictures turned out ok, since im using disposable cameras they arent the BEST for things far away, or in dark places, but theyre still good overall. no worse than a bunch of Jodie's, and she has a good camera LOL.    &nbsp;  it was a really uneventful night, so i really don't have much to say.     &nbsp;  this morning all the showers were in use (except the one with the WORST pressure, because no one ever uses it) so i used theshower in the bathtub. i liked that, but youre in your own little locked room... it makes you think of home lol. the pressure was incredible though... it just about knocked me over! LOL    &nbsp;  this morning class was kind of boring. not much to say about it. today's lunch was Mexican themed (there are lots of people here from Mexico)... Elizabeth taught me how to say her last name, and a word that means "dude", as in the way we say "hey dude!" but its what you would say to a girl (she said to say it if you forget their name LOL).... the Mexicans never like the Mexican food here, because its our version, not the real stuff LOL    &nbsp;  today is Jun's birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUN! oh, and its also Jessica's birthday... HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSICA!...&nbsp;and tomorrow is Elvina's birthday, so i might at well say HAPPY BIRTHDAY ELVINA! while im at it.     &nbsp;  well, thats all for now... workshop starts in 20 minutes.... this evening is manditory dance #2... Disco *boo*........ au revior!

       we didnt do much last night. not much at all. we ate supper and then just sat around in the caferteria talking for two hours, then Chris and i used the internet for a while. (Matt, Sarah, and Jodie went to see  Anchorman , but i HATE Will Farrel so i didnt go). after that, it was back to the cafeteria for more sitting and talking. woo hoo! then, we went to the games room, where Chris played piano (man he's good... out of the three Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars he knows, the sad version is the best... it is also HORRIBLY DEPRESSING lol. he also plays this really happy song that makes us laugh every time LOL) ... CHRIS'S RASH UPDATE (becuase you care):&nbsp; its going away! lol..... while Chris piano-ed it up, i taught Barbara to play pool (because&nbsp;IM a big expert HAHA)... we tied 3-3 games... she won two when i accidentally sunk the 8ball, but she actually did win one!... then Matt came back and beat me, but then I beat Pamela, so i was 50% for the night... good enough! LOL yesterday was the halfway point, so its 17 days down and 17 to go (ok, now there are only 16.5 days to go lol)  &nbsp;  this morning was our mid-session exam. it went ok i guess, i really have no idea. we also had an oral exam, which was basically talking to the teacher for like 2 minutes. she asked us to describe our family, tell her if we like the campus, say what you want to be when you grow up, and how you will continue applying yourself in French after the program.&nbsp;after 4 questions, she said "Merci" (Thank You, juts in case ya didnt know) and i was like "oh, shes just thanking me for answering the question" but then she said it again, and i was like "oh my god, its over ALREADY??"  &nbsp;  we dont have much planned for today. this afternoon, we have to go a a manditory fair, at which we get to play free games to win prizes, such as sparying an animateur with whipped cream LOL. this evening, we are going to WalMart to develop our pictures. there are lots of other stores near the WalMart too, so im sure we'll go looking (but i CANT buy things!)  &nbsp;  au revoir!

       so, i forgot to post this last time (thanks for reminding me mommy...) ... the Sum 41 concert actually WAS cancelled, and it wasnt just the animateurs telling us it was so we wouldnt want to go. oh well, i saw them last year LOL    &nbsp;  so, last night was the Querre des Clans (Family Feud) and it sucked, because it lasted 2 hours (versus the normal 30 minute TV show!) and only 20 people actually got to participate, and i wasnt one of them, so i got to watch all night. plus, we were sitting on the floor, which was hard, and there were "commercial breaks" where the animateurs put on really lame "commercials" and skits, but they werent funny.&nbsp; it was the first activity that i didnt like... the first 45 minutes or so were alright, but then it got dumb. and all the people up there knew NOTHING (EG.: Name something that falls: AN AIRPLANE). one time it took 9 guess for them to start the round, because NO ONE knew.     &nbsp;  so, today was class, and it was alright. Amanda M. and i started our oral presentation for friday, and it should be pretty good. we also started our class presentations for the end (that we have to present to everyone else) and we are doing three little seperate skits. i am with the Anastasias, the Amandas, and Elvina. the Amandas and i are on the same wavelength, and we are basically the one doing all the work, but the Anastasias dont seem to like what we're doing (too bad for them!).... since we are imitating the animateurs, we were trying to pick who we will be, and the Anas were like "lets pick the 6 animateurs and then assign them to people" and so they chose the most popular animateurs. the rest of us want to each choose the animateur that we WANT or are most similar to, which makes SENSE! (i want to be Mathieu, cuz i have the clothes for it, and hes the closest personality to me too, and Ana H was like "no you can be Fabien" but i have more in common with telephone poles than with Fabien!) but whatever... i know that in the end, it will go the way that my group-inside-a-group wants it to go, so YAY lol    &nbsp;  today is tacky-clothes-and-singing day. i am one of the four people that are dressed up (although its not THAT dressed up... just my plaid pants and my ugliest-plaidiest-plaid shirt, cuz i dont really have any "accessories" or anything like that.) ... the other people are Jodie, Sarah, and some other girl (plus the animateurs, and cafeteria workers,&nbsp;of course). also, if we sing our sentences, the animateurs will give us tickets for a draw later today... we sang all lunch and only got one, but one is more than none i guess! you wouldnt believe how hard it is to sing your french sentences! LOL (its ALWAYS the same tune though, so that helps hahaha)    &nbsp;  anyway, im off to my workshop now. then its changing my sheets, then free time for the rest of the night :)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; au revoir!

      Well, first i will start off by saying what was in the disgusting sandwich, since i forgot to. There was peanut butter, ravioli, spaghetti sauce, marshmallows, soda crackers, syrup, caramel, and something else (i think it was either mustard or butter). for the next two days, i would randomly smeel peanut butter and just about throw up! &nbsp; we had quite the busy weekend, and it all started on Friday evening: we (Sarah, Chris, Matt aka Sexy Susan) decided to go to a mall so the guys&nbsp;could get haircuts and i could develop my pictures. when we got to the bus station (to switch buses) Chris decided to call his mom and ask her what he should do about his rash (he went to a water park on sunday and the next day he woke up with a rash on his back, which we dicided was shaped like a "squished donut").&nbsp; his mom told him he should get it checked out, so we decided to see if there was a health clinic-type thing at the mall we were headed for. it just so happened that there was a hospital across the street, so taht worked out nicely. for the next three hours, we sat around the ER and waited for them to check him out (you know, they look at you 30 mins after you get there, but then the DOCTOR has to look at you)... all the while, we were thinking of our chances at eating supper at St. Hubert's (we wanted chicken).&nbsp; so, we left the hospital and had to go get Chris's perscription, and we remembered that right across from the bus station, there is a pharmacy, so we went there. we then decided that we had enough time to get our chicken, since friday curfew is 12, so we took the bus BACK to St. Hubert (ACROSS FROM THE MALL) and we got them to rush it. so, the food got to us in like 10 minutes, we wolfed it down, and made it back with 5 minutes to spare for the last bus to teh campus. YAY US! &nbsp; Saturday morning, going to La Ronde. i was supposed to make sure&nbsp;Matt and Chris got up, since they didnt bring alarm clocks *ya thats right, they didnt bring alarm clocks!*. so i was set to wake up at 6:50 because we were leaving at 8, so i woke up (without my alarm, although i thought it HAD gone off and i had gotten out of bed, turned it off, and returned to bed.) so 20 minutes passed, and i was like "OH MY GOD! I HAVE TO GO WAKE THEM UP!!!!" so i JUMPED out of bed and ran to my alarm clock (which i cant see during daylight for some reason... the light makes it unreadable) and it was 6:25. i had missed nothing, and i went back to sleep for the precious 25 extra minutes. so, 8AM, it turned out that i had woek up Matt because he was meeting a friend of his in Vieux Quebec and NOT going to La Ronde, and Chris (and Sarah) had to be awake to see if they could go. they had missed the sign up, because there were only spots for 140 people out of 265 (for the most popular trip... STUPID ORGANISERS!)&nbsp;so they got to go if someone didnt show up on time. everyone showed up, and we left without them :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; the 3 hour&nbsp;trip&nbsp;on a yellow school bus to Montreal SUCKED and my butt was sore the entire was (starting just 20 mins into the trip.)&nbsp;FINALLY we got to La Ronde, and we had tons of fun! ok, not TONS but lots.... Feona was sick, Katrina actually threw up (on a tree lol) and i had a headache. the sun was hot too, but that didnt stop us from having a good time! we went on The Monster (this HUGE wooden rollercoaster with two different runs... we only had time for one. i heard someone say its the biggest wooden rollercoaster in North America, but im not positive.) there were always two animateurs at a set spot in case we needed them, and at one point it was very funny, because Marie-Jos√©e was there and so was Laurence, but she was asleep LOL. she got woke up *i think thats bad grammer* by rain though... we were in line for a kids roller coaster, and i noticed some dark clouds far away, and then we noticed some lightning, and within 20 minutes it was pouring on us. since we were already in line (and under these tenty things that were keeping us semi dry, and though they were mesh so they werent REALY keeping us dry) we stayed in line... all the rides were stopped and people kept leaving the line, so we were moving forward so it was ok. finally the rain stopped, the ride started again, and since we knew it would be our last ride of they day, i made the most of it. even though it was a kid roller coaster, i scream at the top of my lungs on every little hill. it was awesome. Pink Haired Pamela said she heard me from where she was standing in line for another ride!!! so, it was time to leave, and we all got on the bus. but wait, someone lost their schoolbag! *cue 45 extra minutes of waiting ON THE HOT BUS while an animateur went looking for the person who was looking for the schoolbag!*.... the ride home was again long, but there was a silver lining. the bus stopped for gas, and across the street was Tim Hortons. the first Tim Hortons that 140 kids had seen in 2+ weeks. we cleared the place out. i brought back donuts for Chris, Matt, and Sarah but Matt didnt want one and Sarah was already gone to bed. since they had been in my schoolbag they got kind of squished.... a squished donut for Chris... just like his rash HAHAHA &nbsp; that night, i got 10 hours of sleep. it was amazing. &nbsp; sunday started at about&nbsp; 10:50 for me... i had my first real shower (the kind with WATER PRESSURE... not like those other ones where you get a little bit misty) in a week.&nbsp;we rode the bus for an hour to Basilica St-Anne-Something. woo. hoo. all those big churches are the same... and once youve already seen Notre Dame in Montreal TWICE, theres no big hype lol. then we drove back half an hour to Montmorency Falls which SUCKED since ive been to NIAGARA FALLS many times, and although these ones are 30 meters higher and you get to walk over them by bridge, they were the least spectacular thing i could have imagined. we got off the bus at the top of the falls, and we had to walk across teh bridge and take stairs all the way down to the bottom to get back on the bus. well, only about 20 people didnt hear that, so we only waited 30 minutes for the animateurs to go&nbsp;up, find them, and bring them down to the bus. man i hate people! lol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we got back and had supper, and then i did my laundry (it only took 1.5 hours because the GOOD machinces were AVAIABLE WHEN I GOT THERE!!!). Chris and Matt got their haircuts during the day because Chris and Sarah had been to the Falls before and knew that they sucked, and Matt didnt want to go.... Chris, thank you for cutting off the Almost-Mullet! &nbsp; today&nbsp;we had class in the morning AND the afternoon (its the only time there is afternoon class, and it is the first time ever. no one knows why.) it was alright, but i was falling asleep cuz it was really boring. we got our oral presentation marks from last friday.... we got 7/10.... thats ok i guess, btu it was because Anastasia barely participated (not nearly as much as Simone and I)... the equal participation thing was one of our comments, along with the fact that it was funny, and WELL PREPARED. if only the teacher knew that we thought of what we would do FIVE MINUTES before we did it! HAHAHA...... this week it is groups of 2, and i am with Amanda M (who i thought was Amanda W LOL). im glad to be working with her, cuz shes nice and i know she'll actually want to get work done LOL. &nbsp; tonight is the Guerre Des Clans, which translates to War of Clans. it is&nbsp;ACTUALLY Family Feud (you know, the awesome gameshow.... Richard Dawson *i believe* although now its Richard Karn.) that should be interesting. anyway, im going to eat supper now. the food better be GOOD... for the last&nbsp;6 meals, ive gone for the more expensive/less healthy meal because i&nbsp;have been&nbsp;afraid of the mass produced meal. au revoir!

       last night was "Horror Night", and while we thought we were just  going to be watching a movie and answering questions about it, it turned out that we had to&nbsp;be in teams (chosen by them, so i only knew ONE person in my group and i didnt really get to know the rest... i talked to a few of them a bit, but most of them were of the rude, annoying type). so we had to do activities in the residences (of course, you had to go back and forth between the residences each time) and every time you won a challenge, you were given a letter to help fill in the secret message, which everyone needed to get by the end of the night or we'd all die LOL. anyway, our first task was singing a song, but it had to be done by figuring out the notes painted on a piece of paper (i dont know a thing about music, so i was glad that someone else did). then there was a competition between two teams (just one person per team) to see who could find an apple in water first, and then the person had to find "toes" in a bowl of flour. our team won that too. next, we were in the gym which was dark (everything was dark... just lit by candles) and there was a BOWL OF FOOD but you couldnt really see what it was. one person had to eat a sandwich containing the food, and since my team was a bunch of wussy babies, MYKL had to do it!!! (i wanted to be a wussy baby!!!). so i did it, and it was HORRIBLE, and i almost barfed it up, but i didnt and we got another letter for our code. for the rest of the night i was sick, and i could constantly feel it in my stomach. the other competitions werent really worthy of noting. something that IS though is the fact that the animateurs were AMAZING in their roles (they were all dead.. and they stayed in their roles the entire night, it was VERY well done). in the end, everybody got the code figured out, and we all lived (with like 2 minutes left)! everyone was whining and complaining that it took until almost 11 and they wanted to go to bed, but those people suck. no one knows how to have some FUN and not worry about getting sleep (since we dont get much any other night anyway! LOL)    &nbsp;  so, today was our oral presentation in class, and it went AMAZINGLY WELL! literally 5 minutes before we did it, our group decided that we would just disregard anything we had planned and ad lib the WHOLE THING. never practiced, never discussed, and it was great! we just turned it into a conversation about how fun it is here (although Anastasia took the role of how she misses her parents). Simone was AWESOME at quickly making up funny things, and she even got a few secret jabs at Anastasia in the process&nbsp;HAHAHA!&nbsp;i dont know how on earth it happened, but we ended it was a group hug LOL... oh, and during it, i was like "oh i want to take a picture of something"&nbsp;and i walked over to Feona and took a picture of her. she was schocked that it was a real picture.. i cant wait to see how it turned out LOL    &nbsp;  This afternoon we were supposed to go rollerblading (at some place actually for that sort of thing) but its raining, so the six people that signed up (me, Jodie, Christy, Rubeen, short Matt, and some other girl) had to decide if we wanted to go today or next friday, so we chose next friday. so now instead, we're going to go to a mall so i can get some pictures developped and Jodie can get a schoolbag and Chris can get his "Almost Mullet" cut LOL. but before we get to the mall, we're getting off the bus and walked the few blocks to the Tim Hortons we saw the other day.&nbsp;we CANT WAIT to get our hands on some Timmy Ho's!!    &nbsp;  tomorrow is our trip to La Ronde! it will be so much fun! Jodie and i are going for sure, but since theyre only taking enough buses for 140 people out of 265, Chris and Sarah dont get to go :(.... they are actually talking to Fabien (the guy in charge) right now to see if they can still go, since we are only taking yellow school buses, so you can sit three people in a seat if you want to, and we have all agreed that we will LOL. Sunday is our trip to some Basilica and Montmorency Falls which should be cool (the falls part). there is also our SUm 41 concert that night (although there is a rumour going aroudn that it has been cancelled, although no reason why has been given. plus the rumour was "heard from an animateur who heard from another animateur" so i think that means that they just want everyone to think its cancelled so they wont be crying that they cant see Sum 41 AND be back before curfew, even though we WILL be because we are just going to take a taxi back)    &nbsp;  oh, i forgot... they are always getting us to sing (teach us french songs) in our class and our workshops, and today we sang this REALLY addictive song from Star Academie which is like Canadian Idol for just Quebec. it is SO GOOD lol    &nbsp;  anyway, that was certainly enough for today, although you needed lots of me today, because you dont&nbsp;get any more of me until MONDAY! (i know, its tragic).... have a good weekend everybody! au revoir!

      yesterday afternoon we had the "Olympic Games"... it was a lot more fun than i thought it would be, even though my class didnt do very well (we won a few events, but not many)... we were the best at the tug-o-war... very very good... but our pyramid making abilities (to have it stable) were not LOL.... we didnt win, but thats ok  last night was very boring, as it was the first night in 11 days that i had absolutely NOTHING to do! Jodie was playing soccer and Chris, Sarah, and Matt went to see Farenheit 911 and since i just saw it, i didnt go with them. so, i went to my room without a purpose (for the first time) and i played cards and listened to music for about 45 minutes. then i went to look for Jodie, who was supposed to be doing her laundry, but she was still playing soccer, so i watched the last few minutes of that. then we went to the laundry room but it was full, so we decided to go to the cafeteria (air conditioning) and played cards with a girl named Megan (#3) that we met there. while we were there we also got talkign to some of the cafeteria staff (theyre mostly young... its sad because they work very long hours to serve us). one of the guys had a cd of him singing in english and he got me to listen to it... it was good but it just wasnt my style of music, plus some pronunciation was a bit hard to understand, but it was still good LOL...    after that, Jodie and Megan went to bed, and i decided to walk around for a little bit before the others came back from their movie, but i ended up stopping to talk to some other people for the entire time, so no walking occurred (but we do enough walking here already, so thats ok LOL). then when Sarah Chris and Matt came back, we sat around outside for an hour and talked until we had to go to bed. and that was my evening of nothing to do.  oh, i forgot... Jodie, Andr√©anne (animatrice) and I were playing Scrabble IN FRENCH for a while, and i was winning the whole time, and then Jodie had to go so it was just me and Andr√©anne playing and i was still winning until she also had to go, so then i was playing against Sarah (advanced class) and i was STILL winning, so i am awesome at French Scrabble! LOL  this morning class was better than yesterday, and Simone and I confronted Anastasia about the skit. since we still had NOTHING done and it is to be performed tomorrow (she "didnt know" that the ORAL PRESENTATION ON FRIDAY was the oral presentation we have been "working on" all week!). we told her that we think it would be best if we each come up with a short story of something that happened to us in Vieux Quebec and we will tell the stories, since there is less than 24 hours to write AND learn a skit. she then countered with "ya, it can be like a dialogue of us telling each other what we did" and we were just like NO.   anyways, im off to my workshop. au revoir!

      hey... last night Jodie, Sarah, Chris and i went to Vieux Quebec so Sarah could buy a pair of shoes that she saw the other day... you just dont pass on $50 Dr. Martens!... the ones i saw that i want are kind-of-bright green, but theyre 110, so i dont think ill get them LOL.... i thought we were gonna miss the bus to go back (cuz Chris had to stop at MacDonalds, even though he already had TWO plates at supper, plus whatever we didnt eat LOL).... on the way back we saw a Tim Hortons right near a bus stop, so we are going to go there the next time we go out! (it is the first one we`ve seen since we got here!!)... for the rest of the night (about half an hour) we just sat around in the lobby of my residence and talked, and we had a quick game of volleyball right there with Marie, √âric, Andr√©anne, and Meri√®ve (some of the animateurs)  today, class SUCKED... i liked my teacher every day but today... today she was always mad at everyone for taking too long to do presentations and things (everything we do turns into a presentation to the class!!!) and she expects us to give these fantastic presentations when she only gives us 15 minutes to decide WHAT we are going to do, and she expects us to also know how we`re going to do it and exactly what we`re going to say in that time too.... i REALLY didnt like her today. plus, we got back something that we had to write the other day (it was just a half page about a trip we`d like to take, and i even included some of the travel words we had learned) and so i got the rough copy back yesterday and she had written "not long enough" and so in my good copy i added some more (even though it was 2 lines longer than she had asked for) and then on my good copy we got back, she wrote "you can do better"... #1, why didnt she write that on the rough copy, and #2, how does someone who has seen me for a few hours each day for 6 days know that i can do better??  anyway, in our class, we have to do oral presentations in groups every friday, so this week i am doing a skit with Simone and Anastasia H. (yes, in my class of 18, there are TWO Anastasias BOTH originally from Urkraine... there are also 2 Michaels and 2 Amys).... so, yesterday we started planning our skit, and Anastasia was kind of controlling over what would happen, and me and Simone we just agreeing (plus sometimes we cant understand her accent LOL)... today Simone tried to ask Anastasia a simple question in french, and i understood it all 10 times, but Anastasia needed it in english, and then Anastasia went to ask Julie because none of us knew. while she was gone, Simone and I were both quick to voice our opinions of how she scares us and we hate the project shes planning (plus, she just keeps reinventing the first 3 seconds, so were getting no where... and she keeps talking about "her imagination"... we keep saying "your vision?" and she says "no, my immagination") so we were in the middle of deciding that we wanted to completely change our project and just tell a little story about something Quebec-ish, and not do a skit at all, when Anastasia came back and we had to change the subject. in the end, we`re still doing the play, but im allowed to be a male janitor now (even though Anastasia REALLY had her heart set on me being a girl) and Simone and Anastasia switched roles, because we noticed that Anastasia LOVES repeating Simone`s lines OVER AND OVER and she likes the whole acting thing, so its better this way. it will be over in just 2 days, but those 2 days will be torture for me and Simone LOL  well, thats all for now... this afternoon we have some sort of Olympics, and that starts in like 40 minutes so i have to go eat lunch... au revoir!

      yesterday afternoon, our class trip was to the Citadelle (the fortress surrounding Vieux Quebec). it was interesting, but it was hot so that kind of sucked LOL... all the canons are named after women for some reason LOL  last night we had our soiree Quebecois for 3 hours. there were two guys that played some music, and we were forced to dance. BAH. so that was ok but kind of boring and it was a little hot, and then we went on to the next part. they told us some legends, and we had to sing again, and we played a boring game that no one knew how to do very well (matching quebec sayings with what they mean)... then we played a game where we had to pretend to be Canadian animals. i ended up being un hibou (an owl LOL). Jodie and i spent the whole night with Sarah (who we met on the bus the other day, and who went to Vieux Quebec with us) and her friend Chris (who is the other guy in my workshop (there are only 4 floors of guys and like 10 of girls) LOL).... they are from the Halifax area.  today, our class had to come up with a team name for the "olympics" we are having tomorrow, so we cam up with The Nordiques. they were tryign to come up with something else to go with that, and although someone was repeatly suggesting SOLDIERS, i came up with Les Nordiques Chics (you know, chic.. smart, stylish).... and that is our new name!  in our workshop this afternoon, Jodie and i finished the pages we were working on, and then we given the task of making up a questionnaire to give to all of the students, which we finished quickly. after the break, we just went outside and played a game, because it was too hot inside to work. why must it be so rainy or so humid?? lol... but right now im sitting right in front of an air conditioner, so its nice.   i have nothing planned for tonight, except right now i have to go change my sheets (once a week they change our bed sheets) and since Jodie is going to be doing her laundry tonight, i may go to Vieux Quebec with Sarah because she wants to buy a pair of shoes... or maybe not! au revoir!

      Hello again everybody! its been a while since i was here last! lets see....  FRIDAY: we had class in the morning and then free time the rest of the day, so in the afternoon we went to see Farenheit 911, which was good. (although a few parts were slightly gross). then we went down to Vieux Quebec for the first time on our own, and it was lots of fun! we just walked around, took some pictures, and i bought a pair of bright red Dickies pants (and no, thats not something i could buy at home, ive never seen bright red ones LOL)  SATURDAY: we decided to go shopping at the three big malls all beside each other, and then go down to Vieux Quebec again. because the bus system here SUCKS we didnt make the first one, because the bus that leaves the campus and comes back to the campus only goes once every hour-hour.5, so when there are over a hundred people waiting for the bus, even though we were FIRST in line, it depends on where the bu pulls up. since people were standing in the road, the bus stopped before the people, instead of stopping in the second lane like it sometimes does, so us, as well as matt and his friends (who at this point had missed TWO busses) had to wait for the next one. by the time we got to the mall, it was about 430, and apparently it closed at 5. so we walked through to the next one, and it was closing. and guess what, SO WAS THE LAST ONE! so we got on the normal bus (because we have to switch from GREEN to BLUE, which comes every 10 minutes, to get to Vieux Quebec)...   SATURDAY continued: so, we spent about an hour.5 in Vieux Quebec, and we ate at Chez Ashton, which is like a higher class of fast food. i had MINI POUTINE SAUSSICES, which is basically poutine with sausages. VEEY GOOD!.... we shopped around a bit, i found a pair of bright orange Dickies shorts that i want to buy, but im not going to because im not really a shorts person, so although i love them, i dont need them. the Violent Femmes were playing that night at the Summer Festival, but we decided to go back to the campus instead to watch the french movie that they were playing for us there (just on the tv, you know?) and it was supposed to be Amelie which is a really good french movie, but it turned out to be 10 Things I Hate About You, and 1 i dont want to see that and 2 dubbed over movies are the WORST!..... so, we missed the Violent Femmes, but i hear that it was kind of boring anyway, and its not like they have a ton of popular songs (although the theme song for our program here is to the tune of Blister In The Sun... its a pretty good song actually, we sing it enough that most people know at least half of it if not all of it... im talking about the french one lol)  SUNDAY: i managed to sleep until 11:20 (with a few minor interruptions, mainly due to most of the people leaving for the water park that i didnt go to, since im not a water park person)... anyway, i had a shower (the pressure was HORRIBLE) and then Jun came and said "Feona wants to go shopping and the bus leaves in 40 minutes" so i got ready quickly and went and ate lunch, and we went to the malls that had closed the day before. i didnt buy anything lol. then we went back and had supper, and i had to do my laundry since i HAD been going to do it during the day, but we went shopping... there was a line for the laundry, so i ended up being there from 7:30-10:30, meaning i missed the Floor Hockey game that i wanted to play in :(  TODAY: this morning we had the "American Soap" which is put on each monday by the animateurs... today everyone was pregnant, but no one knows who the fathers are HAHAHA... then we had about 45 minutes of announcements of things to do in the coming week, and then class (monday class is only 10:30-12, not the usual 8:30-12) after lunch, we went on class trips... ours went to the Citadell, which is the fortress of Vieux Quebec. it was SOO HOT, which is a change form all the rain we`ve had lately.... it was kind of interresting, but kind of boring, and the heat made it less fun than it could have been. when i leave here, ill be going to eat supper (i hope its good... for lunch we had some sort of good meat LOL).... tonight we are having a Quebecois evening, with legends and songs and such (a little scary, but not in the actual horror theme sense LOL)  so back to the buses, apparently they have gotten the bus company to double the number of buses on the weekends, so we can all actually go when we want to! plus, all the computers have been fixed, so now more than 10 people can be on at a time!!! i cant believe that we are already done 9 days, and its almost 10! i bought some postcards, so sometimes soon ill have to start writing. Happy Anniverary to Alison and Jupiter. this special mention is your present LOL. Im so excited this week, because on Sunday, SUM 41 is playing on the last day of the SUmmer Festival, and we asked Chantal (the head animatrice) if we can turn it into a group outing since most people want to go, but she said that would just be impossible (and since the bus schedule is stupid and sunday curfew is 11, we would have to leave the concert when it is beginning cuz its 9:30) but she said that if we just took a taxi, it would only take 20 minutes and would be about 30 bucks, so that split 4 or 5 ways is cheap, plus we already bought the pass to get into all the concerts for 8 dollars (we got them half price) so like 13 or so dollars for say an hour of SUM 41 is AWESOME!  anyways, thats all for today. maybe ill be back tomorrow. au revoir!

LOL.. i dont remember if i talked about the workshop yet or not, but me and Jodie are doing the album, which turned out to be the yearbook that everyone gets at the end... its fun, and we are doing the pages for les animateurs, which is fun.  anyway, thats all for today... au revoir!

      Bonjour! Today was tiring, just like the rest lol...  In class we had to present our region with another person from the same place, and i am the only person from even close to Ottawa, so i had to go by myself. There is nothing to say about here! lol  then, we had lunch [we opted for the more expensive poutine rather than the cheap meal of mystery food!!]... in the afternoon we had the Ralley Loufoque  (tranlastion=crazy rally).... it was a timed group scavenger hunt, and things could be anywhere on the campus... we were second :(  after that, we waited in line for an hour and a half to buy our tickets for the three optional saturday excursions.... we got in line quickly, so we had the best chance of getting a place before the spots filled up.... we are going to La Ronde (amusement park in Montreal), whale watching, and the Biodome in Montreal.  then it was supper [pasta and rice, and i had lemonade :)] and now im here. all i am going to do for the rest of the night [the first free night] is have a shower and watch Canadian Idol, because Feona knows one of the singers [Brock... the one i dont like LOL]  thats all for now... au revoir!  P.S. if youre going to leave comments, please put them with the most recent post, so i dont have to keep checking every single one. thanks!   also, i forgot to talk about the rest of yesterday!!!... the BBQ was good, but we had to play this HORRIBLE game... everyone had three clothes pins and if someone heard you speak english or say OUI or NON, they got to take one from you... it was annoying but fun, especially when you could trick les animateures LOL... i ended up with 13, but the winner had 101 [because tons of people just gave all theirs to him]... the dance was ok, although it was kind of annoying, because they played all english songs, then all spanish songs [there are lots of people from mexico] with some french mixed in

      Bonjour! This is the first time ive been able to get on here since i got to Quebec...   the drive here on Saturday was long and boring... i wanted to sleep in the car but it was very uncomfortable. on Sunday we drove around forever looking for the place.  Jodie and I quickly met lots of new people, including Feona, Charles, Thanh, Christi, Jeff and Jun.... les animateures [the people who run the thing] are really fun!  the first day [Sunday] Jodie, Feona, and i toured around the campus to find everything... then that night we got an actual tour, and learned where everything is, even though we already know!   yesterday [monday, which seems like a million years ago] we had our placement test to see which class we are in... im in intermediate 2B... its basically the 5th of 7 levels.  in the evening les animateures gave us tours of Vieux Quebec.... we didnt see a huge amount, but it was fun. except for when it was constantly raining LOL. we`ve also been playing frisbee in the gym, and there is pool, air hockey, etc. in the game room.  the food in the cafeteria is good, but they must eat a lot here in Quebec... i never get the full meal offered and i still cant finish it all! [you get to pick the things you want in the cheap meal... if you buy something else, it costs more for much less]  today we had our first actual class... Julie is my teacher.... it is okay, but boring... although its more doing things and speaking than learning, which is good. Feona is the only person i knew in my class, but i already know all the names and some things about the people [there are two Michaels, 2 Amys, 2 Amandas and 2 Anastasias!!!]  .... later we are having a BBQ for supper, and then a welcome party  internet time is a hto commodity... there are probably 30 computers at the most for 265 people, and they are only available at certain times... we missed out yesterday LOL  this afternoon i have my first workshop day... every tues and thurs we have our workshop which we had to choose [i am doing Summer Book with Jodie... i wanted photography but i didnt get my first choice... we are basically making an album for the entire time we are here]  i think thats enough for now... enjoy the Big Brother and Amazing Race premieres tonight [for those people who will be watching] oh by the way, we are constantly busy, so i dont know how often ill get doing this, but keep checking anyways!  Au revoir!  PS.. mom, can you get my report card and email my marks to me? thanks

[btw, the other rollerblade is in the duffel bag... you know... right underneath my pale yellow dress shirt. seriously.   Anyway, i leave tomorrow at 11am... oh my goodness! only 11 hours to go! bye!

      ok, we will start with our class presentations on Wednesday afternoon. Ours went great! Everyone remembered our lines, and we only mumbled a bit of our song (which we read for the first time on Tuesday! LOL). Lots of the presentations were good (some were BAD) but i think ours was one of the best!  next up: getting on the bus to Qu√©bec for the last time (Wednesday night). the 5:05 bus, the first chance to get off the campus that day, and almost EVERYBODY was waiting at the bus stop. These people STILL haven't learned that 3 minutes away, visible from the main bus stop, is another bus stop BEFORE the main one that everyone goes to. Chris and Matt were inside getting warm clothes, and me and Sarah headed to the bus stop. The bus came, but Chris and Matt werent there... we decided to get on the bus REALLY SLOWLY and then i saw them, so i got on the bus but wasnt giving my ticket until they got there. The four of us made it on the bus, and we waved at the huge group waiting at the next stop when we got there, and they were mad LOL! Probably about 50 people got on the bus, and the rest got left behind, to wait for the next one. We took the bus to an Italian restaurant called Le Jaune Tomate. We were there for quite a while, and we had a great time. I had fettucini alfredo with chicken for the first time, and it was SOOO GOOD! (thanks Chris and Sarah for saying i should get it LOL). After supper, we walked around for a bit, but then it was time to head back for the last time :(  Thursday morning. 7:00AM. My alarm clock goes off. I get out of bed, turn it off, unplug it, and put it in my suitcase. Now everything is packed. We go for breakfast and I have my usual Fruit Loops and a bottle of water. Next is the written exam, which didnt go as well as i had hoped (it was just so WEIRD... and the part where we had to write a story, i wrote it SO WELL and it was like 8 times the length it was supposed to be (50 words min ... 400 words written) but it was only worth 6% of the exam! After our last break, our class went outside to have donuts, and to do our oral exam. We were in groups of 6 and when our teacher would give us a picture, we had to talk about it and she would just wander around and listen. After 40 minutes (and several pictures), she said "ok, everyone who spoke French in the past 40 mins just got 100% on their oral exam!" :D  after lunch it was time to clean out our rooms... wash your mirror, sweep your floor, pack everything that isnt packed. I applaud Chris for getting all those clothes back into one suitcase (with a little help from me standing on it)... he kept trying to give or sell his shirts to me... i should have bought his plaid shirt that reminded us of vegetables (for some strange reason) but im sure it wouldnt fit me anyway LOL... then it was time to get ready for the Gala, because we were leaving at 4:30 (but in keeping with tradition, we left at 4:50). We got to Lac Beauport at 5:30, and we went inside where we were greeted with orange juice and sprite *boring*... only 2 glasses got broken! LOL... after standing around in the smallest room that 300 people have ever stood in before for about an hour, we got to go into the main room. After another 45 minutes or so, we got salad, which was ok. Then we got what we think was pea soup. I dont like peas and i dont like thick soup, so that did not get eaten. the main course was chicken (it was good) with rice (it was hard and contained strange vegetables, so it did not get eaten) and various cooked vegetables shaped like various geometric shapes (also not eaten). The bread was the best part of the meal... every time they would bring us another bowl, 9 arms flew at the bowl (one for each person at our table, naturally) and the bowl was empty within seconds. Dessert was some little cakey thingy that was good too.  After eating, there were presentations of things, and this long and boring goodbye to Marie P., the coordinator, because it was her 7th and last year. Finally, it was album time... and we, the people who made the thing, got the recognition we deserved... we got ours first, although we had to pass them out to everyone else too LOL... the cover is orange, just like i suggested, so that makes me happy! The next 3-4 hours or so, there was a dance, but i didnt really notice... i spent the entire night getting my album signed by everyone who had any impact on me during the 5 weeks... in the end, 71/265 people signed my book, which is incredible. we left at about 1AM, and were back to the campus at 1:40.... we had 20 minutes to decide which residence we wanted to stay in if we were going to stay up all night. My friends decided to stay in DLM so thats where i was going, but then Chris and Matt decided to be losers and stay in AC. I faught with them for 20 minutes, and in the end, i won... they came over to DLM!  since Chris really wanted to sleep, i let him sleep on my leg, and he was there for a good half hour... my leg becoming more numb and pain-filled each minute, but i wasnt gonna wake him up. Then, at 3AM, Barbara Guzman was leaving for the airport, and i knew that Chris would be mad forever if i didnt wake him up to say goodbye (plus i wanted to say goodbye) so i woke him up and it took 10 minutes for him to realize why i had woken him up, even though i kept saying "because Barbara is leaving!". Barbara left for the next 45 minutes... it was very sad, and when she said that she would walk back to Canada from Mexico if she had to just to see people again, it made me cry. But that wasnt the first time i cried that night... At about 2:30, Jodie and I were fighting with Raluca about when we would leave for the train station the next day, because we were all sharing a taxi. our train was leaving at 1:15 and it was a 10 minute taxi ride, so Jodie and I wanted to leave at 12, but Raluca said 11:30 was the latest we could leave. When she asked why i wanted to leave "so late" i said that i wanted to spend as much time with my friends as possible since i may never see them again, and i just started crying cuz that made me sad. Every little while for the rest of the day, people would leave and other people would cry. People cried about nothing. I was like a faucet (leaving is hard for me). All night, Chris slept on and off, and every time he would wake up, i would tell him that he had to sign my album, but he would say NOT NOW!... about 6AM, we made up a game... put a dime on Chris's nose without him waking up LOL. at 7, when we were going to eat breakfast (cuz thats when the cafeteria was open) we decided that we would go to sleep for a bit instead. so since we had only one pillow, 4 of us used it LOL  we woke up at 7:30... best half hour of sleep i had since i got there!... we were all so refreshed!That was when we realized that Matt was leaving in half an hour (he had gone to finish packing earlier) so we quickly went over to the other residence to look for him. We found him just before he left, and that made us all sad again.... theres something about watching people pull away in a taxi that is horrible! After that, we went to the cafeteria for one last meal. I got Fruit Loops (to stay consistent) but i also got sausages because it was part of the breakfast of the day, which i hadnt gotten sinc ethe first week. i thought they would charge me for the whole breakfast of the day, but they just charged for EXTRA MEAT lol.  We then decided, that since we had been putting off dying Pam's hair for a week (there was really no time) that we would do it then... so at 8:30 AM, i dyed hair for the first time! it turned out really well... i nice dark purple-black colour. While the dye was doing its thing, i climbed the gym wall a few times just for fun (but i dont know how, because its practically impossible! LOL)... here is a picture of that, courtesy of Pam... although the pic doesnt really show the impossible-ness of it all!    After that, we hepled the girls bring all of their things down from their rooms, and hauled it over to the other residence where most people left from. At 11, Sarah's parents came to get her, and that was very sad. When we were saying goodbye, we realized that Sam Roberts was playing in the background, and i had introduced Sarah to Sam Roberts about 2 weeks ago, so that was sad. Sarah was on her way to Montreal for a week with her family. Have fun Sarah!  So, now its 11. We promised Raluca that we would meet her outside the residence at 11:30, but we wouldnt be leaving until 12. Chris still had to pack some things, so he got me to go with him. He also still had to sign my album. We sat around in his room for a while and just talked, and at 11:40, i forced him to write in my album... he had no choice, it was now or never. I think he had been putting it off just because he knew that if he wrote in it, he was saying goodbye. It didnt take him long, but when i read it later on the train, it was easily the best thing that anyone wrote. I helped him take his stuff downstairs, and Raluca yelled at me for not being there 20 minutes ago, but i didnt really listen or care. We were leaving in 10 minutes and Jodie and i still had to say goodbye to Chantal (the best animatrice) and then Chris disappeared, cuz he had to get his room inspected by 12. The minutes were disappearing and there was still no sign of either of them, but then they both got off the elevator! Before Chantal even got all the way to us, i started crying again, cuz i will definitely miss her. There were lots of hugs. Then i hugged lots of other people... mainly Amanda M. and Chris. then we went outside to wait for a van taxi (we had WAY to much stuff for a car) and we all just kept hugging each other and crying LOL... at 12:20 there was STILL no van taxi, so we somehow managed to get in a car with all our stuff. Raluca was yelling at me to get in the car, but i just couldnt leave Chris without one more hug... i was about to leave my best friend, and she didnt understand. i cried most of the way to the train station. when we got there, we saw Amanda W. and Marianne, so that made me happy, since i didnt even know that we were going to be on the same train. Jodie and I slept from Qu√©bec to Montreal, and then after the craziness of the Montreal train station, we stayed awake and talked for the rest of the trip. Pulling into the Ottawa station SUCKED.   When i got home, i immediately doubled my MSN list. It was hard adapting to the english keyboard again, so now im pressing SHIFT 6 for a ? by accident LOL. I wanna thank Jodie so much for going with me, cuz i wouldn't have gone if she hadn't. I wanna thank all my friends from Qu√©bec too, especially Chris, Sarah, Matt, Amanda, and Pam... you guys were a lot of fun and i will make sure i see you all again. remember: -C'est pas fini, c'est rien qu'un d√©but, mes c'est le plus beau des commencements -On vit chaque jour comme le dernier, parce qu'on vient de loin now its time for some pics, courtesy of Pam (more for those who DONT know who the people are LOL)    Chris and Sarah on the bus    Pam dying my hair    Jodie and Amanda M. ... not the best pic of Amanda lol    Feona    Matthew Ryan... nice face LOL  thats it guys. thanks for stickin with me for the past 5 weeks. Au Revoir St. Charles Garnier!

       Last night, I went to Archambault (remember from my other post? its the music store? yes. now you remember.) with Chris and Matt. It was semi-fun, but really it wasnt (it was just an opportunity to get off the campus again). We spent an hour and a half waiting for the second bus, because the bus system here is stupid, but again, we were away from the campus, so that was fine!      This morning was our last class, and it was fairly boring, mainly because everyone was  SO TIRED . We played some moderately amusing games, but that was about it. This afternoon is our class presentation... all the classes have one... i think ours will be one of the best, because we have been working on it for a while, and some people were still making it up today. Tonight there are a bunch of us going to a restaurant called the Yellow Tomato for a nice supper (we reserved an entire floor). Tomorrow morning is our final exam, and then our class is having a little party outside (with donuts!!) LOL. After that, we have to clean our rooms and finish packing (im did most of mine last night... just the thigns i need to use are left) and at 4:30 we leave for the Gala (its at a hotel about 30 minutes away. we leave at 4:30 and get back at 2ish)... then we are going to stay up all night long, eat breakfast, and leave for the train station at noon. we'll be in Ottawa at 6:22, so i'll be home by 7:30 :(      This is the last time i'll be on the internet before i leave, so this is my last post from Qu√©bec. When i get back, I'll update on all the things i do in the next two days. I can't believe its been 32 days already... i will miss everybody! See everyone in Renfrew again soon. Au revoir!

       Last night  was the talent show. it was good, and Chris played the piano AMAZINGLY (and Irina sang well too, cant forget about her, i guess, even though she was kind of just an added bonus of Chris's performance LOL)... i also got to see Amanda M. doing her little hip hop dance with all the other hip hop dancers LOL (i know it and she knows it, she was always looking around to see what to do next, but she wasnt the only one LOL). It was also the end of the soap opera that the animateurs have been putting on for us throughout the whole program, but it was a cliffhanger! Marie set the hospital on fire with everyone in it, but we dont know who lives and who dies! :(.... im hoping that they will do another part at the Gala on Thursday, but it is doubtful. We got out past curfew, and then me and Matt went to talk to Chris in his room for a while, and Godefroi saw us talking in english at midnight and still didnt give us warnings, because everyone loves us! (that was deserving of both a linguistic AND behaviour warning! LOL)      This morning class was boring. this afternoon is our last workshop, and since the album has already been taken to the printers, we were supposed to go swimming. But we're not, because the weather was bad this morning when they made the decision to not go, even though it is nice now. Im so glad, because i just dont like swimming, and i dont even have a bathing suit here LOL... so, instead, we are doing something in the classroom.... Chantal and Marie said that they still have a surprise for us though, so i cant wait to see what it is! (im sure it cant be EXTREMELY exciting, but ya never know iwth this crazy place LOL).       so, i guess thats it for now... we dont know what we are doing after the workshop, but its free time so we'll probably do SOMETHING lol... Au revoir!

       DONT FORGET TO READ ABOUT MYKL VS. CRAPPY SATURDAY BEFORE YOU READ ABOUT HAPPY SUNDAY!  Sunday, we woke up late (i was 20 minutes late for breakfast, as usual, but since it was Sunday i didnt feel so bad LOL) and had some breakfast. Then we sat around and did nothing for a while, and then Chris, Sarah and I went to the malls/ Archambault (the most awesome music store). Our July bus passes ran out, so now we must pay to go places :( LOL ... i bought a splitter for my headphones (so other people can listen to my CD player with me... ist worth it for the whole 4 dollars lol), but since there are 8 billion different types, i got the wrong one (each person could only listen to the left side) so we had to return it which took a bit lol... but i got what i wanted in the end and i was happy!..... then we went down to Qu√©bec and did some walking and shopping... i bought a red and black shirt (FOUR DOLLARS OFF!) and an etching from Rue des Tresors.... i got 8 bucks off that, but only because i bought black and white instead of sepia (it was nicer, and the guy selling it said that any real artist/collector would much rather the black and white, and if people agree with that, they get the discount LOL).... its very nice, and for the size i got, it was a really good price. Its mainly of the Chateau Frontenac, but there are some other things as well (obviously LOL). i spent close to 70 dollars on it, but i didnt feel bad about that because its really the only souvenier i bought in the five weeks (except a magnet). We came back and did laundry, and while we did that, Sarah, Matt and I used Matt's portable DVD player to watch "Amelie" (awesome movie)... we could all listen with headphones by splitting his splitter with mine! LOL During laundry time, i went to put my clothes in the dryer because my washer was done, but actually Sarah and I had blown the breaker, so our clothes were sitting in soap and water. It only took about 15 minutes to be fixed, and we just had to run them one at a time to finish. then we went to bed.  Today was my oral presentation with Rubeena and Matt-With-A-Red-Hat. we made the entire project up in the ten minutes before we presented it, and at first i was weary of Rubeena's improv abilities, but i think we did really well! We had nothing to do this afternoon, but didnt really have the time to go to Quebec since at 8:00 we have to go to the Spectacle Amateur to watch people who think they have talent (go Chris) so Sarah and I went to Wal*Mart to develop pictures. *YAY*  thats all for today... now we are all caught up. I have one minute left in here, so i must go. Au revoir!

       FRIDAY NIGHT: me, Sarah, Chris, and Matt went to Qu√©bec in the afternoon. we just looked around a bit, ate supper at Subway, that sort of stuff. then, Sarah and I left the others and we went to meet the rest of our group (most people were getting there by the bus from the school because they hadn't gone to Qu√©bec earlier) to go on the Ghost Walk. It lasted about an hour and a half, and it was interesting. Since it was all in French, you had to always be paying attention or you would get lost (i did once or twice) but it was easy to understand if you listened. Marie-Jos√©e was the animateur with us, and since she does ghost tours as her normal job, she told some of the stories herself (i always liked her stories better than the ones the other lady told lol). It wasnt really scary, except for when we went into this church at the end and it was all dark and the woman told some creepy stories. On the way back to the campus, some of the kids had had some things to drink, and i watched one girl puke on two separate buses. YAY. The people of Qu√©bec will be so glad when we are gone... their buses will no longer be overcrowdewd full of puking kids and singing Mexicans LOL      THE WORST SATURDAY: 7:51 i woke up. the bus for the Biodome in Montreal is leaving at 8. i jump out of bed, get ready faster than anyone ever has before, run down the stairs, all the way to the cafeteria (while putting on my belt), buy my lunch, run back to the parking lot and get on the bus at 8:02. my alarm clock had been set for 6:30PM. three hours on the bus... not bad... i slept on the floor, with Short Matt's bag as a pillow... a water bottle digging into my neck. it WAS comfortable. we got to the Biodome, ate the lunch that we had bought in the cafeteria, and then it was time to go in. yay... 100 kids piling in all at once, as well as all the people on vacation during the busiest weekend of the year. it was hot, it was crowded, but at the end we got to see penguins so it was worth it (except all the babies were really ugly! LOL). then it was time to leave the Biodome and go to the botanical gardens/insectarium.... it was raining so hard that it was like taking 100 showers at once. we waited at the door of the Biodome until the bus was good and ready to let us on, then we ran, but we still got DRENCHED. everybody is wet... we get to the insectarium and the rain has stopped, but we are still soaked. go inside, look at bugs... there is a scale where you can determine your weight in ants. at first, i was 4 000 000 ants, but then five minutes later, i was only 3 200 000 ants!    i only have five minutes so i need to speed up my story. we were constantly getting dry and wet all day. we went to downtown Montreal to eat supper and shop if we wanted to, and we saw an awesome candy store so we went to it. then, when we got on the bus to go back (remember, 3 hours) and i found out that my CD player was broken from all the rain. i was SO MAD. so, i tried to sleep most of the way home, with nothing to listen to. the ride was very long and boring. at one point, Sarah and I were both asleep (we were beside each other) and we woke up at the same time both thinking that we were very close to the campus, but it turned out that we were still 45 minutes away!!!  we got back and i went to bed, but i wanted to check my CD player one more time.... it works.... but that wasnt a happy ending to Crappy Saturday, because it was after midnight... it was the beginning of Happy Sunday.      ****it is now time for me to leave, so i will come back later to talk about Happy Sunday, today, and the fact that four days from now i will be on a train :(    Au revoir!
