      I thought I was the kind of girl that nobody cares what I am up to as I was so strange. Whatever I said, whatever I have said had been accepted by others as I was so strange, that's what I have felt.  I had so called friends and people that love to hang out with me but I knew they were treating me funny. I was a pretty faced crown. For chicks I was a good bite for all those guys they don't want. For boys I was such a good conpanion as I don't ask them to be good looking or to be weathy enough to hang out.  I liked it that way. I knew I was an outsider in such isolated country. I was all right to be an outsider as I didn't really get used to such isolated society my friends had.  Out of BLUE, it happened. Everybody started to talk about me, talk about what I had said, what I had done.  Maybe it is a good sign, I am now officaly in their society. Finaly I grew out of a crown. Maybe I should be pleased.  But I feel so BLUE. I am so scared of being inside the society. I am so scared of others that looking after me. I know how to wipe my arse, I do not want anybody to look after me... I feel as if I were a caged bird. I feel as if I were a bird with broken wings.  I liked it in the old way. I liked it when I was a crown. I knew everyone thought I was so strange, but I was a bird that could  go anywhere. I was a migrating bird that could live anywhere in the world.  As the enviroment changes, I am stucked here, I now have no wings to fly away.

      I had a fun day with him.  We went out for the beach, the wine museum, climing, shopping and dining. All this really happened on a day.  The beach was dirty, the museum was boring, climing made me sweat so bad, only bought a pair of cheap sandals, and the restaurant was where we have been sometimes.  We had done so much for a day, and nothing was special. Not a thing was special...  BUT! I had fun. I had fun walking down at the beach with him, I had fun tasting fine, I had fun sweating bad, I had fun choosing sandals for him, I had fun eating out with him.  It is so strange how much fun I have with him. He isn't  funny guy. He doesn't talk much, I am the one who always chatters arround him. This is a big big myth that he never made me feel bored.  I feel that he and I will end oneday. I feel that I am not the one for him, neither he isn't the one for me. He will oneday have enough of me chattering, enough of my craziness. I will oneday wake up and think he is boring. We are too far different. We don't match... Yet I wish to spent all day with him, yet I feel so safe his arms arround me.  Stop thinking of what will happen, and appriciate how it is now. Appriciate how delitful the life is when he is arround.

      A movie promotion is going on here  and that is making   girls to send a post card writing  about  3 things they wanna   do before they die in coming two month.   It is for the moview called "10 things I want to do before    I die" (in Japanese: I don't know about the original title)      I watched the movie. I liked it pretty much. Although she   was the same age as me, her life was far different. I never   had a husband nor I never raised kids. The first guy I kissed   is someone I am not sure who he was...       When I found about the promtion, I thought of the 3 things.   And never found the answer. If I was to be dead in two months   by cancer, i don't think I will be arrowed to travel too far so my   long dream to see Orca in Canada won't happen. I don't even   get to see NewYork, I will never see Finland... That suck.      I wanna see the world with my eyes before I die.   that is all I want...      But when I think of 3 things I should do, it is easy.   Go see friends and hand out with them for the last time,   I wanna make my parents happy for the last time,   I should leave my bf so he won't know i am dying...
