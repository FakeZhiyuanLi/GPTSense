      So now once again, it looks as if the xbox 2(nextbox, xboxnext, whatever) will have a hdrive. Judging by these articles:     urlLink No hard drive.     urlLink Yes - hard drive         I think the new design looked cool too, but I'm sure that is just a prototype. {too cool for Microsoft}

      So, today I decided that I wouldn't even try to make a crazyjoe.net website and instead divert all my energies into making a blog that was 10x better and 3x faster. Well, at least 5x cooler. I'll be getting some comments running in a little bit and everything will be fine.   I think.   I plan to do with this blog, what many others might have done had I been paying attention, but basically post about computers and technology and crap. Maybe life just a little bit of the time. But, lets not let life take control of you before you take control of it, right?   So to start off with my plan... (I should use less "dot, dot, dots" and more "dots") Google is introducing  urlLink G-mail . Should be interesting and I will definitely check it out because my hotmail account if 87% full 70% of the time and stuff google makes is cool anyways - 1GB. Who cares about a few text ads. (I guess these people do)   Have you ever been to  urlLink musicplamsa.com ? This crazy music artist search engine displays results in a spider web format with your artist in the center and related ones close to it. It has a little disagreeable and some short clips. plus the ability to zoom in and out. Definitely cool.   Speaking of cool search engines, check out  urlLink kart00.com . Its flash based.   So this last weekend, which is the one the happended before this week, I made a new user profile in windows xp. Why you may ask? wait you didn't ask anything. Why?-you may ask: Because my other profile was screwed up really bad and wouldn't display pdfs and windows media player. So now everything is fine again and I promise to make a log off all installations, errors, malicious code, viruses, and other bad things, all in one file called index.html. Yes, that's right, this file. Because i thought a plain word file on my desktop would be too boring. SOW....   Today I installed dBpowerAMP wma to mp3 converter. Because I needed to covert my previously converted files back to mp3 so that they can play on my new mp3 cd player.   Put a dash between crazy and joe? No of course not.  urlLink (homestarrunner.com)    So until the next thing...

      today, I got a domain from ....eu.kz .  Other options were .tk and .co.nr , but I already had adresses on those services.  So know the site is  urlLink crazyjoe.eu.kz  which is really good.  Short name, Amazing Results.   So know, getting into google.  Won't be that hard accuatlly because blogger was bought by google a while ago so they might already have me. I will go see.  No, not yet.  But, one of my other sites is on top with "crazyjoe blog"  So, in that case, I should submit this blog becuase I'm sure no one in the world has laid eyes upon this word - "sucks" , much less the rest of the site.  Do you people that don't come here want to post here? How about you email me, or write a comment, or sign my guestbook or something. Should get a counter.

      From  urlLink engadget.com:        Could Microsoft be preparing to drop a potential bombshell with the Xbox 2? We don&#8217;t know  anything for certain yet, but check out this tantalizing bit of gossip we received&nbsp;in response to our post  earlier today about the Xbox 2 and  urlLink whether or not it&#8217;s  going to sport a hard drive :      Regarding the Xbox 2 hard drive, I was snowboarding in Whistler, B.C. from February 19 - 26, 2004.&nbsp; We were  in a bar called the Amsterdam Cafe in the village one night and J. Allard, the head of Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox division was  in the bar with some friends.&nbsp;I recognized him from a recent Business 2.0 article and we started  talking.&nbsp;(He bought my friends and I a round of drinks he called &#8220;Hey Zeuses&#8221; - they were Red Bull and tequila  and they were nasty.)&nbsp;Anyway, we were talking about the Xbox 2 and he said their current plan was not to include  a hard drive in the Xbox 2 itself, but to offer a portable hard drive as an accessory you could buy  separately.&nbsp;Here&#8217;s the kicker:&nbsp;He said what they were trying to do was to incorporate MP3 (and WMA,  obviously) functionality into the portable hard drive and turn the thing into an iPod killer.&nbsp; Basically, the  idea was to come up with an MP3 player that was as good or better than the iPod that would also serve as the hard  drive for the Xbox 2.&nbsp;And he said they planned to sell them as a loss leader at $100 each.&nbsp;      If this is true (and let&#8217;s be clear that&nbsp;we haven&#8217;t gotten any independent confirmation of this), it would be&nbsp;huge, although we&#8217;re still a long way off from the Xbox 2&nbsp;going on sale and a lot of things could change between now and next year.

      and this burst of creativity that is my own ending to " urlLink The Lady, or the Tiger? "                  The right door was open, and everyone was perfectly still, for about five seconds that is until someone in the very back sneezed.  It was a pretty loud sneeze, considering that just a few moments before you could here a pin drop.  This sneeze definitely made a louder noise than a pin dropping.  In fact, this noise was so loud compared to the previous few seconds that several people turned to look at the man who sneezed.  One of these persons was the King, and in turning around he noticed that his own daughter was not next to him anymore.  Confused and worried, he stood up to pronounce his daughter missing, but nobody heard him because at that moment a beautiful woman exited the right door in a semibarbaric manner.  It was a lady known very well by the King.  She was arguably the apple of his eye. That woman was the princess.  But how did she get to the right door so fast?  	Well, the moment she made a quick gesture to her right, she became very worried.  What if the young man saw her right as his left and went to the left door instead.  All eyes on the doors, she quickly crept away from her seat.  	“I just can’t watch the result,” she said to the guard as she left the arena seating.  	And in saying this, she meant two things:  First, she would not watch him get eaten by a tiger.  Second, she would not watch him marry the lady.  She ran as fast as she could toward the little hut that held the tiger and the lady, where she had been just a few hours before.  As it turns out, the king’s workers accidentally put both the tiger and the lady in the left door area which explains why no one came out of the right door and also explains why the princess was able to walk out the right door.  	The King was astounded, but he knew his system never lied so he had his daughter marry the young man immediately.  And they all lived happily ever after, even the man who sneezed because his wife handed him a handkerchief.  As for the lady and the tiger, one was able to escape the hut.  One was forgotten.  And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the side door, -- the lady, or the tiger?

      So I mowed the lawn instead.  And I messed with my x-box.  I now have 22 episodes of family guy on it.  I have watched 5...  (that's how I live without cable TV)  I am wondering what is the next show I should download.  Hmm...    I want to get Vonage Telephone really much so.  It is awesome.  I wish it had our area code. Well, I could get a Chicago area code or maybe a Miami one.  Besides that my life is very much the same as it always is.  And in fact, I think those few things I mentioned were the same as they always are.  That means everything I do is the same.  Except, right now I am drinking water.  That is different.

      I didn't go to school today.  I had a fever last night, and today, my friendly bacteria in the Large Intestine weren't quite working properly.  So I am eating toast. And also wondering if anyone has or ever will read this text.  I haven't told anyone about this blog yet so that might be a big source of no visitors.  More toast.  I won't watch TV probably, but I might go watch Family Guy on my Xbox.  Hmm.  Margarine.

      So I was thinking about everything and I decided that you can only use x-box live on a tsop modded xbox if it is a 1.0-1.1 not a 1.2+.  And then I thought that I should invite more people to my blog.  So maybe I will.. Also blogger should use g-mails spell check cause it is asstastic.  So we went to Iraq because Sadam was mean to his people.  And now we are even more stupid.. I think someone should take something away from someone.

      Yes, pop ups are bad.  Yes the google toolbar is good.  Together they (almost) cancel each other out,  almost.   So don't get mad at me.  This site is free and you are the ones who have to look at it so if you really wanted to, could pay to get rid of the ads.  But, what am I talking about...   "you" most of the time ends up being me and as you can see, I generate about 75% of all my hits, Not Google.  And that should change sometime.  And I hope I get some g-mail invites because that would rock considering they are worth anywhere from $30 - $50.  Or  urlLink even more !  So get the  urlLink google toolbar , or else...  really popped is the correct word for the title.

      I saw the prisoner escape from azkaban. And it was a lot of fun. Mostly, because I had forgotten a lot of what happened. And then a little bit was because a lot of the movie was a lot different from the book.   Like in the book, Crookshanks oddly led them into the shrieking shack by way of the willow. The cat knows how to push on a certain part of the tree to make it let them through. Also it is involved in the scene that follows.   In the movie, The have to fight there way into the passage. And Lupin is seen later using his wand to enter the tree.   This leads me to believe that speculation that Crookshanks is an animagi is false because JK wouldn't leave an important detail like crookshanks having intelligence out of the movie if the cat would later turn out to be a person. (That is if JK has as much influence on the movies as I thought)   Or maybe it would have just taken too much screentime. Or maybe means nothing at all. Or maybe no one will read this.   Also Sirius entered the Griffindor House twice in the book. hmm...   Everything in the 3rd movie was more dark silver and less gold. Makes the gold parts seem even better I suppose. But, this director won't be back so we will just have to see what color it is next time.   Also, the firebird was sent by Black long before in the book.   I'm sure there are many more differences, but I don't want to take the time to think of any more.   Will movie4 have the same actors? yes...

      "I keep hearing that Mr. Bush is a sincere, devout Christian who prays daily.  Perhaps he could enlighten those of us benighted souls who are unable to find any utterances by Jesus in the Bible in which he instructs his followers accumulating vast wealth at the expense of others and bragging about their religious piety.  I guess my bible omitted the part that says, "Blessed are those who arm monstrous tyrants and then launch preemptive wars against them in my name for they shall be rich and have siblings who rig elections."  The administration must be using the version of the Bible that contains the verse,"And it shall come to pass that all things wrong shall be the fault of Bill Clinton because he did have sex with that woman."  And then there's the verse I can't find that reads,"And it shall be the policy of my chosen - though un-elected - one that national security will be breached by revealing the names of spouses in the CIA whose husbands dare to criticize him."  --Gary Gletty (opinion section of the Patagraph)   Lets not elect Bush in 2004  either .

      This one actually made me think about stopping using KaZaa.  Only for a short moment.   urlLink Service to offer movies over Net / RealNetworks, Starz Encore Group team up in venture :  "The two companies plan to start the service, called Starz Ticket on Real Movies,' today. The service, which costs $12.95 per month, is only available to PC users with high-speed Internet access.   The firms first announced plans for the new service in December 2002. But executives said the timing hasn't been right until now, when broadband Internet access has spread to about 26 million U.S. homes.   And the success of licensed music services like Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store and RealNetwork's Rhapsody against free but unlicensed file- sharing networks like Kazaa 'show consumers are willing to pay for online content,'' said Richard Wolpert, RealNetwork's chief strategy officer.   The new service will offer a selection of at least 100 new major Hollywood movies and older films that are released to the home video market at the same time as they are on the Starz cable channels, which reach about 23 million homes with digital cable. About 25 percent of the selection is replaced weekly with new films.   The movies, which are about 600 MB each and take an average of 20 minutes to download, are played back in 'near DVD quality'' on the computer, Wolpert said. A movie like 'Pirates of the Caribbean'' takes longer to download because it takes up 700 MB of hard drive space. Subscribers can download as many films as their computers can store. To prevent piracy, however, the movies can't be transferred out of the computer."

Thats a lot of people.  And now I start to not feel as special. I bet the .2 of a person feels special, but I don't becuase I'm a full person, not a fraction.
