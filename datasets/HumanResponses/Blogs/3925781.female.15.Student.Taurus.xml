          back here again. love. it hurts. sigh. though i hav alreadi broke up wif him, he seems to be part of mi. heard the song "lin mong chao de wei dao" by jolin? tat song had truely stated our relationship. i love him lots til now. but a pity that i hav no face to face him anymore. we seldom chat. i jus smsed him, but he did not reply. maybe i'm jus too bitchy for him to talk to. i guess. everytime i listen to tat song, i would somehow cry out. maybe others dun feel anything but to mi, it somehow seems important. it has turn into the ending of my relationship wif him. a song tot end the steading. i regret letting him go. but if letting him go would make him feel better and find a good gal, i believed tat i hav made the right choice. a relationship of sweetness had ended. i wan to be sweet to some1 but now i no longer hav the chance. jiamin, if u read tis, remember tat time we went ps n i bought the cross sitch? i bought that so as to give him during our 6 month&nbsp;anni. but&nbsp;sad to say&nbsp;we din pull through it. i like him alot, he will never eva leave a part&nbsp;of mi. ask if i wan to patch i would say no. he&nbsp;wan to concentrate on his studies and i feel it's time i should not&nbsp;be so selfish not leting him go. haish. to&nbsp;others he may look simple, but&nbsp;he actualli not. i miss him. although i do c him in sch.&nbsp;when i took out photos of us taken, i&nbsp;cried. when i&nbsp;went to the place where i bought our 1st month present, i'm depressed. i go watch movie, i would tot of him holding my hands.&nbsp;all these little sweetness can never&nbsp;be found&nbsp;again. maybe one should always learn to cherish and tolerate things. i lose him cuz i din cherish him and&nbsp;din learn to tolerate him. i wish if&nbsp;i could be the same old person again and we together happily not facing any probs.&nbsp;well, i'm in lala land. the world of my dreams...  i'm on my way, i hope i could end it off quick.&nbsp;

          back again.hmm.i was supposed to be happy as i finally could concentrate on work and letting things off. however, things dun realli get well isnt it? oncce, a trouble is off, another comes again.funni rite? haiz..sad sia..many of my frens told mi tat i should be out of the ****** as it seems like i had been used like a object. i felt tat way too. but becuz of the strong feelings i ahd for the band, i was stuck in between. quite confusing isnt it? it all starts wif a big defy of order. if u eva go thru something like tat, chances are, you would feel unhappi and not worth. ta's the feeling given. i dun mind any post but i do hav pride. i may did some mistake, but pushing you up high n then pulling u back down is some how overboard. or should i say it's too much for a student to take. after all, i'm jus still a student. teachers lay hev stress, but that dun mean they should switch off n anyhow do their stuffs cuz it will affect the student greatly. rite now, i'm still unable to make a choice whether to stay or leave. people seems to be happi wif things while i'm not. well, maybe i should be more relax n look at the positive side of it. imagine, after not being a council, i would not be tat stressed up. it would some how allow mi concentrate on my studies too. people say i hav the potential but to mi, it somehow feels as though they needs mi when i'm stilll useful. i'm still veri blur bout it. 2moro gonna give reply to her. not tat easy after all. quite stressed up. when taking to the t/ic, i almost wanna break down. no one seems to understands it. funni isnt it? well well. lifes are like tat. it can be entertaining. but too much will cuz side effect. i do hope tat things in band would turn out great and no longer be so confusing? or wateva it is. i wish it would turn to be a higher level. hmm..is my attitude that cuz such a prob? i'm not sure after all. does things always find&nbsp;fault in a person with more responsibilties? it's quite tough. if i had not shown my unhappiness, chances are, the *** would not have taken any changes. sigh..wat a sad case. hmm..maybe i shall be a normal person with no stress except the strong feeling i hav towards band and my saxophone.. it is gonna be the onli thing i wan to hold on to. band room hav always turn into my second home. it gives a sense of security to mi. maybe others dun felt so. but whenever i'm sitting outside or inside, i would feel i could somehow relax and do my stuff well. maybe becuz of the caring and concern i hav long ago made mi felt tat way. sigh..my feelings now are kinda numb i should say. joinning back or not has not been a prob to mi. i onli felt stress up when they start&nbsp;the stupid ****** thingy.   2dae. as jiamin accopamied mi home, a group of holy innocents' high school boys suddenli *zu* us. kinda surprised by tat. i n her&nbsp;instantly got shocked and went off. funni life i having now. maybe i shold be more open? get to noe more guys? hoping 2 find my dream guy? oh..i'm in lala land..thinking bout the impossible. well. afteri went compass pt. my mood changed better. i bought a new pencil box. like it alot. i olso bought some pens. for writing of cuz. ate mos burger. kinda funni feeling when told 2 sit beside 2 strangers. oh god, wat hav my life turn to? funni huh? maybe i need more than a 24h break. tata..i say til here. gonna sleep. maybe cry the whole nite. i olso dunno...blur..   wat's past let it be then..jus move on with it..

          music. my second life. currently in band, it's fun. well, it's a pity i can never help out in any of the band things. i no longer hav the post of being a major. maybe i'm jus not good enough. guess the others will be able to help out and pull them into a higher standard than mi. sad 2 say, i had put in lots of effort in it. giving up my relationship wif a guy, my studies, my strength and turns out is tis. nevermind. maybe i'm not used to be a normal member after putting efforts in it. realli gonna miss the daes when all 6 of us work together. although it's jus merely a month of work. it realli brings lots of joy and sorrow 2 mi. well, 24/7/04, my last dae being a major.i'll never&nbsp;4get it.&nbsp;maybe it's time 2 concentrate more on studies. sigh..  frenship. like i said my last dae. i was pissed off by my&nbsp;best fren cuz of her&nbsp;attitude 2wards band. maybe i should jus let things off. wat are frens 4? i cared so much bout them but in return i could never get a single thing. hope tat she would understands tat when a fren realli treasures you, dun take advantage of her, thinking tat everything can go your way. i guess tis same goes to everyone. i was hurt twice by 2 of my best fren. i hope she would not turn out tat way.   love. something tat is special and sweet. i believe. when seeing couples 2gether, i would tot of him. he's the guy i love the most but olso the guy tat hurt mi the most. when i was in every relatioship, i had realli loved tat person wif all my heart. never had i want 2 hurt him. i noe. i'm jus selfish. tat guy was a innocent 1,&nbsp; a veri sweet person. i hurt him and of cuz ppl will hav the intention tat i'm the bad and evil person. well, even a best fren of mine had been bu shuang wif mi over it. i guess every relationship has it's starting and it's ending. you start offf well but dun mean u would end it off well. as for the guy i'm interested in, i hav nothing 2 say bout u. i do like you abit but in return, you hav accidentally hurt my feelings wifout noeing it. if i'm not wrong. after all, i'm still a gal. i cried for everything. for my ex, for you, for my frens. i felt tat i hav never ever felt tat way b4. thinking of all these probs will make mi cry, not being able 2 concentrate. i believed. the next time round i got into a relationship, i would never ever let it go tat easily. it's hurtful and not jus a person, it's both.   love hurtz..u agree?
