       My history teacher is an arrogant, self absorbed, physically small and weak, smarmy, vindictive, spiteful little man. He constantly rambles about knowing everything because he was "in the navy 8 years, 6 months, and 2 days" (never achieved high rank and the closest thing he ever saw to combat was a taking over shipload of Honduran counterfeit Levis). He is almost 40 years old (looks at least 46), is unmarried, only wears sweaters, and is obsessed with his cat(s). Every night he goes home and reads every word of every essay, every paper, and every test handed in to him.  I'll give the man (and I use the term "man" very loosely) credit where credit is due; he does know his history... Teaching it is another thing though. At 1:10 the class begins to fill in as students start coming in from lunch or other classes. As everyone takes  15-25 minutes  to find their seats and converse, the pompous "great teacher" stares off into space, or tries to become part of any lame teenage drama going on. Then he addresses the class quietly, in his tiny, mousy, lispy voice. He mumbles to the class and himself what he wants to cover in the class, and points to the notes he wrote on the board. The notes are no more than key words that can only serve as memory joggers, if it's even at all possible that they can be even  that  helpful.  After breezing over the notes, he goes back to his desk, and back to either staring at us or trying to start drama and controversy between the social group of academic stars that he wants so badly to be a part of.... On the board, though he never announces it and most people don't even know its there, is our homework. Since he doesn't go over our chapters and materials he writes our required reading on the board (usually 5-15 pages of our history book which focuses solely on expanding our vocabulary and knowledge of the English language, and barely touches on helping it's readers learn more about history... This book's writing is so complicated it usually takes a good reader 5 minutes to read a page and get anything valuable from it). He spends about 1 minute of this 80 minute period teaching, 4 minutes reviewing the chapter, and 75 minutes sitting and pretty much not doing anything (sometimes he'll moderate the occasional class discussion)... So however great a student this guy is, that gives him no right to say he is even a "teacher" at all let alone a "good teacher." He has a lot of confidence and self esteem issues, so he feels it necessary to play the tough guy or the know-it-all. He tries to make himself feel like a hot shot by showing us his extensive knowledge of history (he's found ways of doing this without teaching us a single thing) and talking about how he teachers his class like a college professor. If that were the case he would be teaching college. He's no hot shot, he's just pissed off that he's a small, balding, weak, middle aged man with a speech impediment who wasted his youth on academia. He takes out his frustrations by picking on his students... and all the wannabe somebodies in the class love the guy, which is ironic because he is their future.  After reading all of this you may be asking yourself "What the hell is he getting at?!"... well, here's what the prick assigned us at the return from spring break at 4-14-04: -12 page min. Term Paper on materials he has not and will not cover in class. He just handed us 4 historical documents (about 15 pages worth) and said "Find 3 internet sources for each and write a few pages on each. -2 page min. book report (this is a history class, mind you)... this isn't so much of a problem, but I can never write anything shorter than 4 pages, and the month is already half way over. -4 page min (I believe) essay on the chapter which he still hasn't gone over all of these are due around the same date. At the same time, we all have to read two chapters of the history book (2 hours of speedreading), study for the test, and do our short term homework.... all for one class... the dude is such a bitch.

       I hear some women, and some certain kinds of guys, bemuse, gripe, ponder and chatter about guys who wear underwear other than boxers (ie. Boxer-Briefs, briefs...)The whole idea stumps them. Why would any guy wear anything but boxers? Perhaps a little explanation is in order: Ladies, some of you bitch about your bras, some of you can't function without them. While small-breasted women can opt to not wear a bra, thus becoming more comfortable, a majority of massively mammaried women can not live without the support of their  knocker lockers . Why? Because big tits flap around. They get in the way. They have a mind of their own and need to be contained... What does this have to do with boxers?... Well, it's the same thing for men. Ill equipped guys can deal with the bulkiness of boxers. There's enough room under their pants to accommodate the otherwise immobilizing folds of cotton. Those of us with  Sizeable Schwanzes  need to wrap it up. We can't afford to have unwanted flappage. It causes drag, and if you shave you'll have to be careful when you sit down otherwise everyone in the room will know your nuts are balled (harhar-double entendre). The shit gets in the way and it has to be situated, if not-- if in the event you have to run-- you stand the chance of tripping over yourself. Briefs and boxer-briefs are reassurance that everything is there and where it should be, not doing it's own thing. Now, going commando is a whole other thing involving airflow, free flappage, and exhibitionistic tendencies. I wont get into that here... at least not now... It should also be said that there are certain fellows who don't think this way and actually enjoy maximum flappage, and there is also the converse-- small, agoraphobic vienna saussages which must hide behind their tight cotton cage, lest anyone know their true physical form.  Plain breifs (whitie tighties) are ghey though.  Now that that's all been cleared up I'm going to get back to reading. I've just finished the second (2nd) story in James Joyce's  Dubliners . Though  very  well written, it's quite disturbing. So far it's only about pedophilia and homosexuality in 1890's Catholic Ireland. Very good. Very Creepy. --- actually. That's all bullshit... There's not truth to that at all. I just wanted to write something stupid... I only have 2 pairs of boxers, everything else is boxer briefs, but they're from when I was really fat so they fit like boxers... DERP!

       Greenwald got a bunch of FOIA documents from the CIA pertaining to MKULTRA, Mind Control, and Remote Viewing... Over a gigabyte of text, I gotta get started on reading this shit. I started reading  The Old Man and the Sea  the other day. At first I though "this is stupid. Why does Hemmingway get so much credit?"... Then I read more and realized this is one goddamned incredible book... I'm gonna finish it now.   check out those FOIA (Freedom of Information Act-for those of you not  "in the know" ) documents folks

       Though I vowed to write a lengthy post at least once every three days, I've just been too god damn busy too keep that promise. I've had a lot of shit running through my head and there just aren't nearly enough hours in a day to get everything I want to do put into play. I think the problem is that I have too many passions (ie. Making music, listening to music, photography, cooking, writing, reading, and "debunkifying" to name a few) and if that's not enough, they conflict with my responsibilities to no end.  I'm looking to write a few things to put up here: -My positive shift in attitude towards The Beatles (I really love that band now... used to hate them more than I hate Harry Potter) -an essay on my desire to produce and to pursue the arts while maintaining a stronghold on the sciences. - A possible blurb about my recent trip to Annapolis, MD (the homosexual capital of the world... "what the fuck is this, San Fransisco?!") - the story you've all been waiting for (whether you know it or not): The Cove Story, aka The Tale of Darlington Woods, aka "How I learned to start worrying and hate my friends" - My "Revenge of the Undercooked Lobster" story. - And finally, a detailed analysis on the character of Michael Moore. How he is a piece of shit. How he is snowing the American people into thinking he's a knowledgeable true-patriot. His real agenda and how I can prove he is a homosexual pedophile In the mean time,I suggest you read this essay/whathaveyou [EDIT: link removed because none of you can be trusted with the URL to Cates site] . I found it on the blog of my ex-girlfriend's sister, Cate. She's an excellent writer, and it seems her sentiments on the subject of writing and literature and her approach of it all mirror mine quite accurately. She's quite the interesting chick. Too bad I never got to know her that well. [edited due to insensitivity]

       here's the bulk of a letter I just wrote to my guidance councilor if you're interested ** Names have not been changed to protect the innocent, because there are no innocents, only myself (right) and them (stupid and wrong) [Please excuse the long-windedness of this letter. I promise you, it does have a point.] Dear Mrs. Hoffman, In past years, school and report cards were something I brushed off without a care. As a student, I was the proverbial “slacker.” With goals set as low as mine were, I had no reason to try. I was a C average student. Then last summer I was diagnosed with ADD and medicated. While I thought ADD was generally an over-diagnosed, non-existent disorder, my medication worked wonders. Suddenly I became more active—I was finally motivated-- and managed to lose between sixty and eighty pounds. I was feeling better about myself and finally developed some ambition. I promised myself that the next school year would be my best so far. I would push myself harder, and do my work with pride, never settling for eighty-five percent less than my best work. This new attitude paid off; as I boosted my grade about ten points and discovered my passion for learning. What, then, could be troubling me about my grades if I seem to have improved so well? I am writing you, as my guidance councilor, in regards to my unacceptably low grade of 82% (a C+). I do not believe I deserve a better grade; the fact of the matter is I DO deserve a better grade. I am never one to deny responsibility for my actions, the results of my actions, or my grades, but in this case I feel that Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s grading scheme is based on nothing but biases (and with reason to be, as bulleted below). The members of my second semester International Relations (IR) class were assigned a research project that would include a debate. For this project groups of two were formed and the class was instructed to research a topic and prepare for a debate. On the class before the debate we were to be assigned our positions (pro or con) on the debate, and have two days to prepare for the debate. While I understand the point of this exercise; to teach the students to look at both sides of an argument before they form an opinion on the topic, I feel that the point was missed, and greatly off target, as we could have been learning about international relations instead of debate and poor teacher organizational skills (we could have also been tested on our knowledge of the subject and gotten graded on that instead of assigned a project as a final, but that is just a matter of opinion and personal learning preferences, and I will not bother to bark up that tree). Most of the students in the class did not understand this objective so lots of bellyaching ensued. The topic I was assigned was “Can and Should Democracy Be Imposed on Other Nations?” I was assigned the position of Pro, as in “Democracy can and should…” This topic is a dead horse and need be beaten no more. Extensive research has led others and myself to believe that there is no intelligent, compassionate argument for the Pro side of this argument. If you are at all curious—In short: The reason that democracy, or any form of government or social behavior, cannot be imposed on another nation is because nothing can be successfully imposed anywhere, unless morality is completely disregarded, which in this day and age is impossible. As long as it is an imposition it cannot work. Everyone in the class, including Mrs. Griego-Boruch, and everyone I have asked since, have all agreed on this. I did the best I could on this project but midway through my debate I sabotaged my debate because I’m not a fool. The topic for the debate was, simply put, stupid, and not debatable. I expressed those sentiments to the class and everyone, including Mrs. Griego-Boruch, seemed to agree. I am a logical person, my integrity is valuable to me, and I was not going to deface myself in front of the class by ignoring the facts. I’m just not that kind of person, and I do not feel I should be graded on my character and my need to save-face in a situation a teacher forces me into. I received a 74% on that project… I’m curious as to what my partner got for this assignment. While this should have no effect on the outcome of this matter, I would just like to comment on the disgust I feel by the insincerity of Mrs. Griego-Boruch, who smilingly commended me on my ability to make strong points from such a hopeless side of a debate. She also complemented me on other aspects of my debate and made me think I was going to get a good grade. Below are a few reason why I believe the class was ineffectively instructed and reason enough to let most, if not all, of the students of that class pick the grades they think they deserve (I know that sounds crazy). •Not enough work was assigned to build a stable grade. We received (I believe) little more than two homework assignments—journal entries to be precise, and I’m not sure how a teacher can grade a journal entry, aside from grammar and conventions, because journals are strictly opinion, and opinion is not justifiably gradable. •Mrs. Griego-Boruch operated like an observer not a teacher. There was insufficient instruction time and if I were to have paid for this class directly out of my pocket instead of my taxes I would have asked for my money back. If we cannot grade her teaching style, it is unfair that she can grade our opinions. •It was not advertised as a debate class. Though IR may have been advertised as a class in which debates take place, I am most certain that it is not supposed to be a debate class. Grading based on debate performance and debate technique are unjustifiable (not to mention subjective. Debates can only be analyzed through opinion, and opinion should never, under any circumstances, affect a grade in any way whatsoever). I would like to see Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s grade book to solidify this notion of mine. •Am I alone in my thinking that a debate should not be gradable in a non-debate class? At least, the teacher must be able to teach effective debating before he/she grades the students on their utilization of debating techniques. That was definitely not the case in my IR class. • It’s been my observation that all of the students in the class (save a few) gave all the same effort, but I overheard Mrs. Griego-Boruch talking to Shivika Trivedi about her 112% for her third marking period grade. While it is true that Shivika did take on an extra responsibility for the class and deserved extra credit, I know that no extra credit should have brought her grade up that ridiculously high when other students putting in the same amount of effort got 80%s and 90%s. I believe it can only be reasoned that because Shivika and Mrs. Griego-Boruch were so “buddy-buddy,” which they were to an irritating extent, Shivika was graded on a much more lenient scale, or I should say, a much more realistic scale, as all the other students in the class deserved to be graded the same. This may not seem important, but from a students perspective this is madness. This is not third grade at St. Thomas, this is Senior High School at Garnet Valley. We are a blue ribbon school and that cannot be accepted. I can believe no other reason for someone receiving such a high grade with so little work to grade than simply being closer to the teacher than other students. (If you do not believe me, ask other students who were in classes with those two, they can attest to their unprofessional relationship.) •I believe class participation plays a substantial role in our grades in that class. I will say I did not participate as often as I possibly could, but every time I participated I had something of value that no one else was bringing to the issue, which cannot be said for half the students in the class. So, suppose all those times I did not raise my hand actually hurt my grade. Why then is my classmate, Adam Akl, listed on the GVHS website under the Distinguished Honor Roll list for the fourth marking period when he involved himself in the class no more than twice (and I’m just giving him a number as high as two just to be safe. I really do not think I saw his hand go up more than once in the entire semester we were in that class). His extreme lack of participation should have, according to Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s logic, plummeted his grade down to something like a 90%, assuming that he got 100% in every other aspect of the grading scheme. I could provide more information but I feel I’ve proved my point and for brevity’s sake I will try to end this letter. Let me end by just saying that with all the above information taken into consideration, and the fact that I gave just as much effort, if not more, effort than the next guy, I deserve a grade between an 85%-94% in my IR class, and I feel I’m being realistic about that. I will not settle for this menial grade of 82%. Unless Mrs. Griego-Boruch can approach this matter under the light of logical analysis in which I have so displayed and show me why I deserve the grade I was given, I will not accept this grade.  ------------{edited} PS- I would also like to meet with you to discuss my schedule for next year. I believe I am signed up for Psychology next year and I do not think this letter will have a positive effect on Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s opinion of me. Also, I am not sure if I am comfortable with Mrs. Griego-Boruch receiving a copy of this letter. As I have gathered from her character, I feel she is the kind of person who would defend herself to the end, no matter how wrong she knew she was. While that may sound like a personal attack, I am only thinking that it is in my best interest to give this situation no more attention and stress than it deserves. But if you feel it’s necessary to give her a copy of this, by all means, go ahead and give it to her.

       So I was sitting in the cafe at Borders today, thumbing through a nude photography magazine, when some jive-walkin' granny decides to stop her little amble down the sidewalk to peer through the glass. Of course, being only eight inches from the window, with my back facing her, she caught me looking at my nudie mag-- A chunky, black-haired English woman eating what seemed to be a peach cobbler sitting on a clear glass plate over her big, hairy, greasy muff...Scrumptious!... I wonder what was going through that old lady's head when she caught me looking at that shit... I just laughed and went back to looking at my smut.

       I'm off to the satanic church today with Easter, Hershman, Chip and the lot. They want me because I'm the only one who can take a decent picture-- their last roll of film didn't turn out. They suspected supernatural foul play... I suspect bad photography. Heish said that Easter had blood dripping from his forehead and behind his ears when he got back into the car... He also said he was wearing a hat... oogabooga... I still call bullshit. If I don't update by tomorrow morning some pissed off goth probably shot me... [UPDATE] DERP! Yeah... So... Looks like I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that li'l escapade

       I've got at least 5 computers in this house, all on the fritz. They were state of the art 10 years ago, when we got them, but now they've all gotten FUBAR one way or another. Everything else in this house was good 10 years ago too. Ten years seems to be the life-expectancy of anything with plastic parts. We have to replace the dishwasher, the fridge, the washer, the dryer (drier?.. That aint right), my fathers computer, my computer, my stereo (started malfunctioning today), we needed a new TV on our current TVs tenth birthday (about 3 years ago). My dads van, after almost 200,000 miles on it, is going screwy. My mom's van, which is less than 4 years old and has about 80K miles on it, needs a new transmission. My car, the 1986 Dodge Aries with 29,000 miles on it, died, so now I need a new car. I'm looking at buying a 1970's Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. It's incredibly badass, maybe too badass for me. My grandmother bought every one of her grandkids their first car--every one except me. I'm looking to guilt-trip her into buying me the Cutlass. If she doesn't give me the $3500 I'm gonna kill her, cause I know I'm in her will. Let this be a lesson to you all. Don't waste your time by trying not to "waste" your money-- Frugality only buys frustration... Buy better than what you need, as you need it. so, while I could live without the following things, I'm going to say I NEED these things: A powermac G5-$2900, a Fodera Monarch (bass)- $3500-7000 depending on whether I get the 'cheap' model or not, An Acoustic upright bass-$2000+, a new old car-$3500-4000, Norah Jones' hand in marriage, a pet squirrel that wears a Japanese Flag headband, the new rediculously expensive Jaco Pastorius release, and most importantly a job. I need a means of acquiring the money to buy the above shit... I don't know how I'm going to manage the Norah Jones thing though...  I didn't shower today. Is anyone else turned on by their own stink? Makes me think about whether I'd have sex with my clone... Ya know?...  anyone... anyone... Bueller?

       Found this on my computer... It's an old essay I bullshitted for a bullshit class.  Important Issue Essay Overcrowding hospitals, viral epidemics, polluted water supplies, gum on the bottom of your shoe, tax hikes, inflation, endangerment and extinction of species, weight loss crazes, senseless advertising, The Jerry Springer Show--- The list goes on and on. These are all problems, and all problems have a source. Many people miss the fact, though, that just about every problem, no matter what the scale, has one source. One gigantic problem can be realized as the tributary to all other problems; the overpopulation of Earth, the never-ending population boom we humans seem to be needlessly suffering through. Every problem has a source, and to totally resolve the problem that source must be changed or eliminated, and while people lazily waste their time complaining to factories for producing too much non-biodegradable waste (because it’s the easier thing to do), these Yuppie ignoramuses are directly contributing to The Big Problem. By continually popping out children every 18 to 24 months, the young couples of the world are choking Mother Earth to death with a noose made of cute little snot nosed toddlers. In days long past, before the advent of technology, couples wed for love, not lust, and had a single child, or two if they really needed the extra help, to carry on the family name, and ensure the future of humanity… Those days are dead now. This is the age of the nuclear family. Each family now consists of a man and a woman (wed in lust of course… and as they say now, ‘over 60% marriages end in divorce these days’) and at least 2.5 children. With the technologies of today, these children are not born to carry on their surname, nor are they birthed to aid their parents (excluding Amish families). They are born for the novelty of it all. Children are cuddly and cute, and for each beautiful child-creature citizen we create for this wonderful country Mommy and Daddy get a nice tax break! (Gosh, that sounds great! Where do I sign up??!!).  The Darwinian principles governing our reptilian brains, telling us to reproduce for the good of the species, have gone the way of the dinosaur in the brains of the masses, and reciprocated in the brains of the logical (those who want to see humanity survive do not have kids because they know it will, in the long run, have a negative effect on the species). With close to 7 billion people on this speck of cosmic insignificance, the most powerful country in the world in TREMENDOUS debt, millions of people thirsty and starving in every continent, the last thing we should be concerned with is creating more consumers. How little land would you say you are comfortable with having to yourself or to share with your family: 1/10 sq miles (around 600sqfeet), 1/20? Our blue planet has only 57,510,000 square miles of land, which may seem like a lot, but little of it is capable of supporting human life. But for math’s sake, let us say that the full 57.5million sq. mi. were usable, with 7billion people in this world each square mile would house approximately 12,172 people. That is about the size of a moderately large, yet still comfortable, suburb, and around 136 times less dense than the population of New York City (weighing in at about 20million people in 12sq. mi.). Since it is not possible for us to spread out like that, many of us are forced to live like tightly packed sardines, while some more fortunate souls get to spread their arms and stretch their legs, though we all share the same effects of this overpopulation. For every problem there is at least one solution. Some may work and some may not, but we will never know what works until we try. China has put limits on the amount of children its people can have, and The United States should follow. Because the lack of a half-decent reason to have children is so widely ignored throughout the states, measures should be taken to raise awareness of the fact that the more people we make the further we set ourselves back from the advancement of our species. Something along the lines of a strict mandatory Parental Aptitude test should be put into works to ensure that only the best possible parents are allowed to conceive, and no more than two children per couple that passes the test. If there are ‘accidental’ conceptions the parents must be tested and if they fail they must put the child up for adoption once it’s born (the child could then go to another family fit to support it). Drastic times call for drastic measures, and if this all sounds drastic, please do not complain when that giant moon sized space-rock comes hurtling into our atmosphere and we have wasted all our time and energy coming up with a reduced fat McDonalds menu and have no way of getting off the planet or saving ourselves.

       “I didn’t know how many of them it would’ve taken to kick my ass, but I knew how many they were going to use… That’s a useful piece of information right there.” -Ron White 	Now it’s time for a story kiddies: It all began on a February evening in 2004, easily one of the coldest nights of the year. My friends, John and Kris, and I decided that it would be fun to go bowling. So, contrary to our more conventional procedures, we decided, probably because the roads were icy, that I was not going to drive. Instead, it would be John’s dad who would chauffer us to the lanes. John, not wanting to be bothered the rest of the night (I assume), chose to leave his cell phone at home…Flash forward 15 minutes—We’re at the entrance to the lanes, each of us waiting to get inside and warm ourselves with a small portion of $5 cheese fries. The doors open, and to our amazement, we were struck dumb by the glory that was EXTREME BOWLING NIGHT!!!®  For those of you who are unfamiliar with EXTREME BOWLING NIGHT!!!®  I shall briefly explain: EXTREME BOWLING NIGHT!!!® Is when the bowling alleys cater towards the lesser white trash that would otherwise not be found at a bowling alley. Lights are turned off and replaced with black lights, leaving just enough light for suspicious activities to take place, but not enough to spot it unless you’re looking for it. Here you can find the bottom of the social barrel. Everyone seems to be stuck in the early 1990s “Thug” phase, where shirts are ridiculously large, pants are found around the knees, and I’m sure you’d be able to spot at least one tuff wigger sporting a gold alarm clock on a chain around his neck. Girls trip on Ecstasy, white guys try to out-thug each other, and the black guys, who seem to be the only semi-respectable group of people there, just go to hang out and talk; not one of them bowls. With at least 300 people crammed in there like Mexicans under a tarp in the bed of a truck on the Tex-Mex border, we decided it would be best to find something else to do. Lets leave… Oh… Wait… I didn’t drive. John… Call your dad…Oh… You left your phone at home?! Ok. There’s a Wal-Mart close by. We can go there to use a payphone.  Now, I told you that story to tell you this story: I must harbor some sort of homosexual gene, because I have, heterosexually speaking, an unhealthy obsession with shoes. I look at them in catalogues like I’m looking at porn. So I see a really nice pair of Merrell chukkas in my Orvis catalogue so my dad and I go to the Orvis store in Media to see if they have them. I didn’t find the chukkas but, while routing through the $300 fishing vests and packable felt hats, I did manage to find one glorious piece of apparel—a worn-out leather aviator’s cap with fuzzy leather earflaps… It fit… It was comfortable… It was $35… I had to have it. Back to the bowling alley. My new hat seemed to draw some attention as I entered the bowling alley. I knew it was negative attention so I took it off… Then we left. As we walked out to the parking lot I found it was still bitter cold, so I donned my aviator cap and pulled down the flaps. Unbeknownst to Kris, John, and myself, was that we were being followed. The two large 20-something-year-old wiggers approached us from about twenty paces away, slowly advancing toward my posse. Being the ass that he is, John started jumping on the rails of the shopping cart station in the Wal-Mart parking lot, explaining how—like we gave a rats ass and a half—he wanted to make a “Jackass™” movie. The wiggers had seen and heard enough. They shouted something to the effect of “Get the fuck off that thing you fucking faggot! That kid’s a pussy!”—Anything to sound intimidating. The second I heard them and turned to see them I knew what they wanted. They didn’t care about John being a douche bag, though that was an incentive to start something—They wanted my hat, and I’d be damned if I was going to give up my new $30 leather aviator cap with fuzzy ear flaps. It was just too cool. So, being the non-confrontational person I’ve grown to be, I told my friends not to acknowledge them and continue walking towards the Wal-Mart, which, to my dismay, looked deserted… What the hell?! I thought those places never closed! The wiggers fell back as the audibly planned what they were going to do to scare us or get my hat. Then they started getting closer again, now at about 50 paces, and John and Kris made their way to the little corner containing the payphone… That’s right folks; they cornered themselves. Since I am not a dumb-fuck, I continued forward through the parking lot, without breaking stride, to the Super Fresh about 200 yards away. Looking back on the situation I feel I should have approached the Super Fresh with a smug smirk of half-laughter on my face, but, at the time, I was worried for my friends. Neither of them knows how to handle themselves in a fight, nor do they know how to talk their way out of anything or operate smoothly in any manner. Considering all of this, I ambled toward the market. I wasn’t “going down with the crew.” Meanwhile, as I made my way toward the market, Kris and John were wedging themselves between a rock and wannabe-black place. As one of the two reached for the payphone one of the wiggers shouted something like “Those phones don’t work.” So of course the jackass, whoever it was, gave up with the payphone. “Do you guys have any money,” queries wigger #1? “Uuuuhhhhhh…No…” Kris replies, loudly crinkling the wad of bills in his jeans with his pale clammy hands. “Well, if you guys let me hold on to a dollar I’ll let you use my cell phone” the wigger says, obviously trying to get one of them to pull their wallets out and expose their cash to see if the white suburban boys were worth their time. John hands the Wigger a buck from his sparsely funded wallet and uses the guys cell phone. He gets some automated message on the other end instead of his mommy… The phone must have been stolen or inactivated… The wigger gives John his dollar back and inquires about his friend who just kept walking—me. Me, my  $80, and my leather aviator cap with fuzzy earflaps make our way to the Super Fresh and, thankfully, it’s open. I step inside the automated doors and take a breath of warm, stale air. I still feel like I’m being followed, and I can hear the wiggers getting closer. I walk into the market just in time. As I hear the wiggers step onto the door pad I disappear into a group of Asian females who, for some odd reason, are grocery shopping at 10pm. I pull some stealthy ninja moves and manage to make it out of the market, all the while eyeballing the wiggers who have now split up and started searching the isles. I meet up with John and Kris in the parking lot and we rush to the payphones…Yes, of course the payphones worked! We called my sister and she said she was on her way. The lumbering footsteps of Timberland boots and Nike Airs approached as the telephone conversation ended, so we decided to rush back to the lanes…the wiggers wouldn’t try to start shit in a crowded public place, right? We’re in the bowling alley waiting for my sister and ogling a girl who’s obviously on some kind of depressant drug. Finally, after waiting for what seemed like an hour, my sister showed up. We get in her car and I go over the story with her. “and then we went to Wal-Mart, and it was closed so I kept walkin’. Then John and Kris corner themselves at the Wal-Mart entrance like fucking idiots” I explain. To which John replies in 100% seriousness, in a completely and utterly delusional brain-fuck of a claim, “I planned that. I did that on purpose. Yeah, that’s what I wanted to happen.  I wanted them to corner us. I had a plan. I knew what to do. I knew how to handle it” … ugh [The above story is as unembellished as possible, except for the quotes, everything is pretty much as accurate as it can get.]  Goodnight everybody. I hope you enjoyed the story.

       In the past year I’ve realized something that has had me slightly puzzled, and deeply… irked... I’m strangely attracted to women I hate (and in some cases; just dislike). I’m sitting here trying to find out how and why, but I can’t figure it out for the life of me. Take my math teacher [Rodney Dangerfield] Take my math teacher, please! [/Rodney Dangerfield] *ahem* so, this woman is, as my friend Theo would say, a “cunty bitch.” We’ll call her “MT” because those are her initials and she’s a Math Teacher—how conveeeeeeeinient! She has, by far, the most abrasive, anger-driven, scolding personality I have ever encountered. I hate her. She is definitely not attractive (she looks like Joe Camel). Then why, as irony would have it, do I want to fuck her (angry Donkey-Punch and Dirty Sanchez sex)? It makes no sense! **[Edit]** I've decided to remove what I wrote in here about my ex-girlfriend. It was a little too disrespectful and immature. So I'll just say she was a cool girl but we were the furthest thing from compatible. We both realized this but I didn't want to admit it. I was lazy and didn't want to have to look for a new girlfriend so I tried to salvage our joke of a relationship. **[/Edit]**I’m just too attracted to people I could never have a successful relationship with. I like these people as friends, no, like is too specific and positive of a word—I enjoy these people as friends because our personalities conflict so much it makes things interesting. But what is this insatiable sexual attraction to people who make me want to puke?! (This doesn’t go for saying that I’m only attracted to bitches)  Another question that just entered my mind-- I believe this is the definitive paradox--King of all conundrums: Is it in my character to do things that are out-of-character, leaving out-of-character actions impossible, or, would doing something out-of-character be tremendously out-of-character for me because out-of-character actions are not in my character? Does my being bipolar make an answer to this question even more impossible?

       Well, day two is up. I've been having a good time so far.  Here's what occupied my time for half the train ride:  -This train smells like every 5th seat was urinated on. There are people sleeping on the seats in positions I could never dream possible.  - 20 minutes into the ride. We're in Philly. Still not used to the smell of ew. Next stop is Trenton, NJ!  - I'm sitting next to the conductor. He looks just like Lenny Clarke.  - Bulleting towards Trenton in my capsule of stink... Philly is a marvelously filthy city.  - Hello, trenton. Did I just see the guy who played Shooter McGavin in Happy Gilmore?  - I smell poop  - I'm writing the post that Kris is waiting for. It's devistating. I don't think I will post it.  - Some lady keeps walking by me and I want to rip that nasty fucking mole off of her chin.  - Next stop, Blobblegaargh, NJ. I have no clue what the intercom bitch just said.  - that building has"Detox the ghetto" written on it  then I stopped.  We arrived at Penn Station and tried to find Heish's grandfather. We called his cell a few times but couldn't seem to locate him. We tried calling him one last time and Matt was getting frustrated trying to find him. It shouldn't be that hard to find a little old jew on a cell phone. Turns out we were standing five feet away from him, in plain view. I thought Heish would know what his grandfather looked like, so I didn't bother asking if that little old man who looks like Bob Colombo from the yogurt commercials with a googly eye was his grandfather... I should have bothered.  So we took a train back to the grandparents' house. Old man drives a Lexus, grandma drives an Audi Quattro. Nice little house, not nearly as jewish as Heish's (actually you can't really tell these folks are Jewish). Very coherent, smart old couple. More up-to-date with news, trends, and technology than my parents (very cool grandparents). We get dropped off at this mall in Long Island which is much bigger than the King of Prussia mall, I'm told (I've never been there so I wouldn't know.) This place was fucking huge, and not a single thing to buy. I ended up sitting in a massage chair in a furniture store for a while. The back massage part was good but when I turned the calf massager on I really thought I was going to cum ini my pants (lovely image isn't it). I need $2000 for that chair. Before I left I bought dark, white, and milk chocolate bars from the Lindt store.... We came home, watched Mystic River, and then I tried to go to bed but realized by 1am that I wasn't tired. Good thing Cate and Kris were online to save me.... Yarrrghh  Day two. Wake up at 7. Leave by 8. Saw Jamie Bookers future on the train into NYC. She was a big fat schizophrenic bag lady. When she King-Konged her way onto the train people looked at her and new something was up. "Jesus, this is rediculous! I want a seat! Can anybody give me their seat! (this was more of a demand than a question)." Eager eyeballs rolled in her direction expecting some early morning entertainment, and the fat slug woman continued, "Could somebody please give me their seat, I've been schlepping all day! This is rediculous! I can't believe this!" And she wasn't just complaining, she was SHOUTING. "Is this upsetting everyone else? I can't believe they don't have a seat ready for me!" Then the conductor came by to take tickets. "Can't you give me a seat? This is horrible. I've been schlepping all day! I've been SCHLEPPING all day! I bet everyone is complaining about this! There's nowhere to sit!" -- "No, no one else is complaining. If it's any consolation to you, ma'm, you're not the only one standing"-- "But I've been schlepping ALL DAY!" (she actually sounded crazier. I love NY)... I asked Heish for a lesson in Yiddish a little later because my vocabulary was strictly limited to anything I've heard on Coffee Talk. What can I say-- I've got schpilkes in my ginnicktegezoik and I'm a schmear schtuppy. Oy, I'm getting veklempt just thinking about it.  I loved the trains, and the subway was great but a little disappointing; it&nbsp;was too clean, new, and uncrowded. I wanted New York Grime and Filth.... New York  is  one grimey, filthy city though. Everywhere you go something smells like it's fermenting.  We met Heish's cousin. She's our age and is an over exaggeration of the stereotypical JAP, I'm-too-good-for-everything-even-though-I'm-dumb-as-my-nose-is-huge-and-spoiled-rotten, kind of cunt that you just want to strangle 'til her fucking head pops like a two-week-old zit on that spot on your back that you can't reach. So, of course, I had to (because it was just too good not to) let our reversed polarities conflict the whole damn day. She had us meet her in "The Euro Diner." Thanks a lot you fucking twat, just what I wanted was to travel to New York City with my jewish friend, myself being a complete culinary glutton, just to eat in a fucking Euro Diner-- Who the fuck would want a nice breakfast in a famous New York deli; I sure as hell wouldn't. I order Eggs Benedict and hot tea, Heish gets a Lox and Onion omlette, and the bitch gets a bagel with a *schmear* of cream cheese.&nbsp;She then tries to talk everyones ear off about trivial bullshit which no one wants to pretend to care about, like stealing her dad's credit card to buy dresses and going to a fancy bording school.  The food arrives, five minutes too late to be considered acceptable,&nbsp;at the hands of our fat, cross-eyed, scatterbrained, and oddly accented waitress, who has forgotten what Heish had ordered. But that was excusable, after all, there were two whole other fucking tables to wait on in the whole fucking restraunt. I could really see how that could be confusing, especially with such a complicated fucking menu. My Eggs Benidict was/were(?) horrible; burned, tasted like crap and the hashbrowns sucked too. Heish's omlette was below average (I've made better myself, and for a lot less than $9 and change). Fats-o forgot my tea, but I let that slide (she only attended our table to take our orders and deliver them. Horrible waitress). I was pretty pissed that I got such a shitty breakfast with such shitty service my first time in NYC, so as a tip I left out gargoyle of a waitress a bill with the face of a $10, but on the back it read something like "DIASPPOINTED? you wont be if you let Jesus Christ into your life... blah, blah"... Have a nice day Mrs. Danny-Devito-as-"The Penguin."...Waaaak, Waaaaaak Waaaaaak! (Despite all of this, I was actually having a very good time.)  Heish's brother's told us to visit the Sony Museum because it was "really cool." We did. Joe and I agreed that it was the stupidest thing either of us ever did. Not only was the technology almost 10 years out-of-date, but the whole exhibit was geared towards kids closer to the age of 5 than 20. (Heish's cousin left for work though, so the silence was enjoyable.)  After that we dilly-dallied for about 60 blocks until we finally got to Ben's Deli which Mathew briskly serpantineing us around the city to find. Our waiter was... wow... I think the guy must have been on coke, or amphetamines. That motherfucker was RACING. He was a middle-aged guy, tall, goofy hair, looked like the dead cop with the bullethole in his head in the freezer at the Fatelli's hide-out in the movie Goonies. Took our orders without writing anything down, ran back two minutes later apologizing for not having anything ready, came back with our iced teas, forgot Joe's Shirley Temple (yeah...), brought us our sandwiches and continued to bounce around like he had a jet powered pogostick up his ass. It was an incredible sight. I told Matt and Joe that he wasn't "all there in the head"&nbsp;and I bet he was the kind of guy that would try to bathe a baby in a blender (probably the most morbid thing I've ever thought, but since it popped into my head so quick I have no doubt that it's true.) The dude actually asked us to leave him a big tip because business was bad. I thought that took balls, so Joe paid $2 extra for his sandwich, and me and Matt both over-paid by about $12. That's pretty fucking generous (on Matt's and My part).  Just becase we thought it was necessary to haul our asses over 100 blocks in one afternoon we went to the giant Macy's. I tried on suits and found out that I'm a 38 short and look damn good (maybe even hot)&nbsp;in a charcoal gray suit (Heish looks good in pinstripes). So I'm buying some suits when I get home. The Asian suit salesman kept trying to sell us suits like he thought we were actually carrying $700 in our pockets. He was helpful though, and I had fun pretending I had money. Then I found an Alfani section. Italian clothes are great for me because they require no further alteration (as I'm built like an Italian. short limbs. wide chest. small waist.... dead sexy), so I got a really nice blue button down shirt on sale for $30. I am officially awesome now. I've decided to hold off on buying a computer so I can redo my wardrobe all Alfani.... While we were deciding on what to do next I almost walked into some security guard. I told him I thought he was a manikin and he continued to stare at me with that "Oooohh, no nigga'. You did NOT just speak to me?!" look.... then we saw Dana Carvey in a platinum-blonde, 1980s, new-wave style mullet, behind a counter selling watches.... fun  Ok, so we putzed around for a while, met up with Matt's cousin in a cafe and I explained to her why she was stupid, why her views on the world and her opinions were wrong, and why she should hate me. Then we saw STOMP! I really didn't want to see it because it was $60 and I'm cheap. It was FUCKING INCREDIBLE. I was really, really impressed. It was just an amazing show; the tallent, the dedication, the polyrhythms, the intensity. I would see it again in a heartbeat, and I'd recommend that everyone who ever gets the chance to see it not to pass it up... ok... it's late now. I walked non stop from 9-8 (or something thereabouts) and I'm probably typing really loud and not making sense because I'm tired, so... 'night.

       I haven't posted anything substantial in a while, mostly because I've been busy at work (where I usually outline my posts) so I'll give this the best shot I can give feeling the way I do now. Fuck. I'll be gone for four days so I might as well post anything I've jotted down recently.  --People here at work are talking about camping and how much they like it. They're asking each other stuff like "What do you camp in? Pop-Top? RV?" "No, we're  really   roughing  it. We're  driving  to a  campsite  and sleeping outside in a  nine-person tent "  What the fuck? That shit made my blood boil. Those choads have no fucking clue what "roughing it" really is. What they're doing isn't even camping.... Last time I went "camping" I slept in a fucking minivan because the whole thing was such a joke I didn't want to try fooling myself.  -- Right now Steve Karaszkiewicz is making me look at his Xanga. It's damn near impossible to read because, like everyone else, he has to have a background picture of something that nobody else gives a shit that he's interested in. Why the fuck do people do this? Now if you're a good enough writer that it makes it worth it to struggle through reading your site, that's one thing (still rediculous). But, if you just write like everyone else and you're just going over your boring day-to-day life, just go with the damn default colors.  -- A large group of extremely good-looking South Americans came in to work today. Yesterday one of the most beautiful females I've ever seen came in. She was a mulatto goddess; all the best physical traits of her races, none of the bad, and she looked painfully smart (looked only 18 too). Hopefully I'll be seeing more of her. You know, there are some people who are so beautiful that you are too intimidated to talk to, then there are people like my mulatto goddess who are beyond that to the point that you couldn't imagine NOT talking to them... Eh. I bet she's a total cunt or has no personality though. Fuck 'er.  I got my senior portraits taken today. My dad wouldn't let me pose holding the diploma and giving the finger cause he said someone might bitch about it. On the way out I saw Sam. People used to think I was crazy for having a  thing  for her, now I'll be damned if she isn't the best looking girl at GV (or at least one of them). Apparently I got hot; that's what her face seemed to be telling me. Yeah bitch, I've come a long way from the short, obese, depressed, greazzy little Italian punk I was. She seemed to like what she saw. That kinda made my day (until I got to work. glargh) She looked really great too, which is people are telling me I was right about her looking like an Italian Salma Hayek if she lost weight. Between the two of us, since we stopped talking, I'd say we've probably lost almost 200lbs.  -- It's Cher"ry, not CHAIR-E! Get it fucking right people!  --I didn't get that Bronco. It was just too damn big. V8 5.1 liters, 350 horses, the size of a GMC Jimmy almost (probably wider and higher, but shorter). Probably only got 8mi/gal. Fuck that. I'll probably be getting a Jeep or Ford SUV when I get back from NY on sunday...  -- I realized that most of what I wrote in my notebook is going to be saved for a lengthy, thoughtful, extrospective which I probably wont post because it's going to be about people I don't like, and I'm sure those people read this shitty blog (and would most likely dick me over if I, god forbid, let everyone know what usless, annoying, boring people they were)  See y'all monday    NP: Tower of Power- Down to the Night Club (Bump City), Soul Vaccination

        I figured I'd chronicle the recent major events in my sisters life since it would make for one interesting, fucked up story.      Ok, so my sister, who looks remarkably like Christina Ricci, is about 33 now. She's a 5th grade teacher at Perryville Elementary in MD. About twelve years ago my uncle introduced her to a silver star, purple heart, paratrooper, Gulf War veteran, Steve. Steve was a brilliant, well read, multi-lingual military machine. He was 5' 8", and weighed about 160 lbs of lean muscle. Right out of the war he was given a job as one of the top officials in the US's war on drugs and life was looking great for him. Amy, my sister, and he fell in love and were wed at my grandparents restraunt. He had already had a son from a previous marriage, Alex, but that kid stayed in CO with his certified lunatic mother and her boyfriend. As time went on Steve left his high-paying narc job to pursue a career in computers. He developed a knack for macintoshs' and started a small independant business, MacGurus. Soon the business grew, as did Steve, and with the advent of the internet business was looking promissing. Computers were everywhere in their small Delaware appartment, and Steve's obsession with them grew. Soon he would find himself basking more and more under the cool blue luminescence of his giant RasterOps computer monitors, replacing his tawny, sculpted Spanish face with that of an obsese, pallid, gnarly pig face with a grisly, unmaintained Rasputin beard. MacGurus eventually expanded to the point where they needed a new headquarters, so Amy and Steve moved to Wilmington. Steve's spending was becoming excessive, he was fixated on the idea that his business would bring in millions, but in it's five years he was lucky if it brought in enough money for a half a years worth of groceries. Amy had gotten a teaching job and she and steve were surviving solely off her five-figure income. Steve continued to indulge himself. As my sister worked all day teaching retards and autictics, Steve took 8 hour naps in the tub, shopped online with my sister's credit card, went out to Borders to amass his library, and probably sodomized the dog. We all thought he was a bit crazy and his spending habbits were a bit excessive, but we though he was a nice guy--we loved him-- so we didn't complain much. Then the camel's back broke and my sister had to leave him. This was a few months before their tenth (or twelfth) aniversary.    Alex, Steve decided back when he and Amy were still trying to salvage their marriage, should live with them in Wilmington. Alex grew up without a father, in the household of his insane mother and grandparents and was most likely abused as a child. He had, as my sister later found out,   Asperger Syndrome  . Basically, he was obsessed with science and thought he was a genius, but he was a complete idiot; he rambled incessantly about stupid inventions and ideas of his and it was embarrassing how dumb he was. He started getting into trouble in school and they had to send him to a "special school," a school for idiot lunatics; he thought it was a school for geniuses. Eventually he got weirder... Steve wound up finding gay porn on his computer. He was acting sadistic, he told lies to get Steve in trouble with the cops, he was abusing the dog, and he was becoming physically violent towards my sister.     It was around the end of 2003, and Alex was causing all kinds of problems; manipulating people, hurting himself and then telling his teachers he was being abused at school, etc. Then he decided he was lonely or something (though I think he did it to cause more problems). He went soliciting older men for sex over the internet. He met a guy named "Brian" online. One day Alex called Steve from school and said he wasn't coming home, he was "going to a friends house." When Amy got home and heard Alex's message she knew something was up because Alex didn't have any friends. So Alex walked to a church near their house and waited for Brian to pick him up. From there they went to a motel off I-95 where Alex had what I would imagine to be the most bizarre gay sex ever with the 30-something year-old elementary school teacher and youth-sport coach, aliased "Brian," who drove three hours from New Jersey for the event... Alex came home to find the police waiting for him, going through all the files of gay porn and sex solicitations that the queer boy saved on his computer. My sister had enough of that kid and his fucked up father, so she left.    Steve went to the VA because he didn't have money and he figured he could get about $2000 a month from the government for his PTSD. There he realized he couldn't stand living with other crazy war veterans, so he found a mercinary job in Baghdad, where he worked for 6 months and made about $50,000. He came back on Superbowl Sunday and stayed with us for three months; my sister had since moved in with her new boyfriend.    At the beginning of the seperation, when Steve went to the VA, my sister moved out of the hose in Wilmington. We went in there and took all the computers, (about 8, with three monitors for each) where we found thousands of dollars worth of hardware that Steve never used which was by now too outdated to sell (probably about $40,000 worth of stuff that was never used, plus the computers). Then we took the boxes of clothes that Steve had packed and brought them to our barn. After that we boxed up Steves library which he had collected over the years; over two thousand titles, some in foriegn languages, which he had all read at least two times each) mostly on comunism, drugs, revolution, government conspiracy, and almost the complete line of Penguin Classics. All of this shit was purchased with my sisters money, and she had no clue how excessive his spending was... Though Steve dressed like a hiker, he had about $20-30,000 worth of fine clothes which he bought but never wore.    Now my sister is living with her boyfriend in MD and they'll probably end up getting married. Steve, last we heard of him, was living in Thialand. He took his $50k in Baghdad money and figured that he could live on $200 a month in beautiful Thialand... He spent $7,000 on a new computer, had five suits hand tailored (he's a XXL, about 350lbs), and hired maids and poolhands as soon as he arrived. He bought two $200 pairs of sunglasses upon exiting his plane...Within a few weeks he managed to spend everything he had and got fired from the job he had there (if he really even had a job at all)....    and I've left major details out and wrote this like shit cause I'm tired and I'm not feeling creative tonight. Waky story though.      shit... Penn and Teller's "Bullshit" came on 5 minutes into writing that, so I lost all motivation. It shows.  NP: Strangefolk-Demo Disc...

       What is up with people and their god damn pubes everywhere? I swear, some people need some sort of pube rogaine or something. There is a pandemic of pubic alopecia that must be stopped. It seems everywhere I turn there are pubes waiting, lurking in the shaddows, eager to skeeve me out. Am I the only one noticing this problem?  There's one source I can positively identify; a certain aquaintence of mine who recently, at the embarrassing age of 16, finally started sprouting body hair in places other than his head. He was just so garsh darned proud of himself that he had to pluck out a pube and leave it on the toilet seat or in the shower everywhere he went, so as to say "look at me, I'm a big boy now."  And what's with pubes on the soap?! My sister and brother must have balding crotches or something. Every time I get into the shower after either one of them there are five or so little black curly hairs delicately decorating the soap. When I'm done with the soap the only thing you'd be able to find would be bubbles!  Two days ago I had to shower in my parents bathroom while my mom painted my bathroom (it looks awesome now). So I draw the curtain to their shower and there, waiting at my feet as if to say "Hello, friend, I've been expecting you," was a patch of freshly shorn, salt-and-peppered, (possibly scrotal) parental pubes. Joy! Just what I wanted to see! And of course I couldn't let them swim about my feet as I showered, so I had to clean them up. Yak!  A while back Kris pissed in my toilet and left a pube on the seat. I don't know how people don't notice that shit; I know I've never been guilty of an absent-minded pube misplacement. Mine stay where they are. They're quite comfortable where they are... Kris blamed it on the Gary the Pube Gnome (I'm pretty sure he's related David the Gnome).  Today in work I went to take a piss. I walked up to the urinal, and there, on top of it, at over four feet off the ground, sat a lone pube gaurding the flush-knob. I had no clue that Shaquile O'Neil went to Widener Law School! What acromegalic freak manages to get a pube on top of a urinal without noticing it and knocking it in to flush it?  And why is it that all the pubes I find laying around are all full length? Is this the 1970's? I thought people trimmed up.?. I do, if not to use my brother's beard trimmer for something gross, than to keep from my crotch from shedding like a black lab in August. Seriously, who the hell is attracted to a full bush anymore? It doesn't necessarily bother me, aesthetically speaking, but it does get in the way of what you want to do. And totally bald isn't good either; it's too adolescent. So trim up folks. Blargh!....  I had A LOT more to say about this but I totally lost it all... so... DERP!  -------  I read the word "ignoble" at least three times today. That's way too much for a word like that for one day.    NP: Blind Melon- Self Titled. Without a doubt, the best band of the 90s.

       I'm a little too pre occupied to post anything good now. I just got a half decent idea though. I have a tower full of hard drives. If I can get one of my UMAXs up and running I'll put all my music on the tower of hard drives and set up an internet radio station where you can stream individual songs or whole playlists. I'll also be able to do my blogging from there, once I figure out html, so I'll be able to post all the funny pictures, videos, and other shit I have... That'll take a while to get into production though  NP: Oysterhead, The Grand Pecking Order- Birthday Boys

       I'm listening to The Ramsey Lewis Trio's version of Moondance with Natalie Wilson on vocals.... It's sublime :-)   I just wanted to let some of you know that I might be using my new SN, PegLegSpeedK1ng (Michael Hedges song. I suggest you check it out), as my main one for a while.     On Friday I went out to see  I, Robot . A the theater I saw the lady I work with, Pat. Today at work Pat asked me what I though of the movie. She said it was stupid... What the hell made it stupid??!! Was it the completely prophetic storyline, where Artificial Intelligence comes  alive  but humans wont accept it as  life? Was it the unadulterated originality of the film, where any and every cliche that could be expected in a film on that subject was pushed out of the way early on to allow for a better movie? Stupid as in: It engaged the audience in deep moral and existential thought and tried to expand, or at the very least challenge, the viewers thoughts on what life really is, all while showing us our own closed-mindedness and exposing out absurdly doubtful nature? Oh, stupid as in: I didn't like it so I went home to watch  Mona Lisa Smile . Gotcha ;-)

       I'm working on something long, boring, and probably whiney that I probably wont post. In the mean time:    I think I'm going to bring back the cod piece. Women have tits. Tits show out through their shirts and everyone knows how big they are. Why isn't is the same for guys? You can't really look at a guys crotch and know what he's packing. Do the women feel like they're getting ripped off? Do they see this as double standard? Why am I the only guy I know-- the only guy in my school-- who sports a cock-bulge? I'll wear pants and if you look you'll probably see my dick hanging down my right leg. Do all other guys just have midget cocks? Am I just the only guy who wears pants that fit right? Am I just stuck in the 80s? Why the fuck am I writing this? Why the fuck am I even thinking this?  I think all that daydreaming of Steve Guttenberg got me all gayed up...*sighs*         NP: When I wrote this at work: Alicia Keys new song. It's good.

        1.) Damn, what a beautifil day it is today. The sun is out, the air is cool, there's a slight breeze, the humidity is low. I'm stuck here at the bookstore looking out the window wishing I could take a drive down Smithbridge to Brandywine Creek State Park for a nice 10 mi hike (it would be 5 miles, but I always get lost); just me, the trees, and the water. I've been thinking about starting to work out again, but I don't feel like going to the Y alond (and my brother is outta town) so if any of you sacks of crap feel up to it let me know, I'd be glad to have some company at the gym. Hopefully I should be getting a car tonight [update: that didn't happen], so I'll probably be able to go out trail running and playing disc golf again. I'll need a co-pilot to help me get to Lums Pond.     ---     2.) C. S. Lewis'    urlLink The Screwtape Letters    is brilliant so far-- amazingly clever and poignant. I picked it up at work the other day. I wish my writing was that clever.       Amazon.com      Who among us has never wondered if there might not really be a tempter sitting on our shoulders or dogging our steps? C.S. Lewis dispels all doubts. In  The Screwtape Letters , one of his bestselling works, we are made privy to the instructional correspondence between a senior demon, Screwtape, and his wannabe diabolical nephew Wormwood. As mentor, Screwtape coaches Wormwood in the finer points, tempting his "patient" away from God.  Each letter is a masterpiece of reverse theology, giving the reader an inside look at the thinking and means of temptation. Tempters, according to Lewis, have two motives: the first is fear of punishment, the second a hunger to consume or dominate other beings. On the other hand, the goal of the Creator is to woo us unto himself or to transform us through his love from "tools into servants and servants into sons." It is the dichotomy between being consumed and subsumed completely into another's identity or being liberated to be utterly ourselves that Lewis explores with his razor-sharp insight and wit.   The most brilliant feature of  The Screwtape Letters  may be likening hell to a bureaucracy in which "everyone is perpetually concerned about his own dignity and advancement, where everyone has a grievance, and where everyone lives the deadly serious passions of envy, self-importance, and resentment." We all understand bureaucracies, be it the Department of Motor Vehicles, the IRS, or one of our own making. So we each understand the temptations that slowly lure us into hell. If you've never read Lewis,  The Screwtape Letters  is a great place to start. And if you know Lewis, but haven't read this, you've missed one of his core writings.  --Patricia Klein             ----     3.) It pisses me off how most of the sentences on/in this blog start with "I." Granted, it   is   a journal, but still, I should know better than that.     ----    4.) It's finally hitting me that I'm going to be graduating high school in about 10 months. By this time next year I should be getting ready to go to college. and starting my mediocre adult life. Last week I was in Mrs. McGrority's 4th grade class at St. Thomas, where she abused and belittled all of us in front of our peers. Two days ago I was standing front and center in Mr. Stevenson's GVMS English class, giving a speech on the life of my then-hero, the great Allen Collins of Lynyrd Skynyrd, nervously flipping through my index cards, sweat beading on my brow and my voice cracking and wavering, not caring that I was skipping cards and not making any sense-- It was too terrifying to care. Joe's speech on Ghengis Kahn was great. Yesterday. Yesterday was the beginning of 9th grade. I had just lost my best friend, Samantha. I had never had a better, cooler friend. She was closer to me that anyone had been before. She'd always acted like a girlfriend to me. She was flirty, physically affectionate, fun, and beautiful (at least to me. that's all that mattered). I fell for her, like an idiot, but the feeling was far from mutual. Though her actions spoke differently, she said she didn't want me as anything other than a friend; I didn't like that answer. It hit me hard-- I was beyond crushed. She led me on and I was willing to let that slide. Thanks to my inexcusable actions the friendship ended. I acted like a total pussy-- incredibly immature. I just couldn't handle it and I fucked everything up. She tried to be cool about it, but I fucked it up and it didn't work. I grew up a lot. I changed a lot. I never did apologize, and though it was really a long time ago, and we were young, dumb, and inexperienced, I still feel like a jerk for what happened. That was all long ago. Why should it matter now, it was stupid kid shit?... I don't know, but it does. That shit mattered to me.     I don't remember growing up, but it happened. I'm practically eightteen now. I'm supposed to be deciding on what college I want to go to now, but aside from that I've grown up being treated like a kid. Now it finally hits like a shovel of horse shit to the face. I am deciding what I want to do with the rest of my life. I've given a lot of thought to it, but it doesn't matter because my plans and interests change drastically every six months or so.    When I first started giving it thought I wanted to be a shop teacher. I planned on going to Williamson Trade School and becoming a master carpenter/cabinet maker/metal smith/welder. This was right around the time that I found out I was bipolar with ADHD. I got medicated and actually developed a sense of motivation. Now I wanted to do someting outside, but I wasn't sure what. I looked into environmental science and forrestry. Up until recently I wanted to live the rest of my life as a park ranger/survival instructor (Sedona, Yellowstone, Glacier... anywhere out west). I set my sights on Pennsylvania School of Technology in Williamsport (what a joke. Fuck Associates Degrees.). There were a few moments when I wanted to join the Navy, just because I love to travel... Then I started actually trying in school... just a little bit... That's when I realized I really love learning, and I'm damn good at it. I wanted to be   something  , not just some stupid park ranger. I have ambition now. I still want to major in a natural science or engineering (I'd like to get my Ph. D. in a science), but I'm not sure what I want my other major to be (I do want to double major). I'm thinking English, Communications (I'd be great in broadcast), Anthropology, or anything that could work well with my science degree (like a language). The main thing is that I want to travel to other countries for long periods of time. Where do I want to go? I have no clue. I'm thining Penn State or Iowa State. If you have any recommendations let me know.     -----     5.) How come dogs never need braces? Their teeth always come in perfectly straight. When was the last time you saw a dog with crooked teeth?     ----    6.) The Ridley Creek State Parke photo contest is comming up. I'm planning on winning that (in every arena if possible. I think it's possible).     ----------     7.) My hands smell like fish (I had tuna and then Kipper Snacks)    ----    8.) When my posts get long I start jumping around and lose track of shit... then everything starts sounding funny/stupid.

       That's it! I've had enough! I'm sick and tired of doing things the hard way! All the time I'm forced to carry two armloads worth of shit and it's just not efficient. I shouldn't have to stack my dessert plate on my mug of milk just so I can shut a door behind me... What is this bullshit?! No, I'm done with this shit-- I've had it! We humans have lots of organs which served a purpose at one distant point in time but have since become useless-- excess bagage. I'm talking about apendixes (that is an acceptable spelling of the word, before you bitch at me), tail bones, pinky toes, toe nails, uvulae (do we really need a gag reflex? c'mon.), that little fucking concave bump under the septums of our noses, wisdom teeth, etc... We don't need that junk. What's the point of it all? There is none. The human body is such an inefficient machine, and why should all that bone and tissue go to waste on all of those bullshit organs and apendages? Starting now, I am  willing  myself to grow another arm, or another pair of arms. That would be something I could use. You could brush your teeth and comb your hair at the same time, or even wipe your ass without interupting your magazine reading. Imagine all those times when you thought to yourself "Self, you could really use a hand with this." Or think about the potential for musical success. Hell, I'm sure it would make sex a whole lot more interesting.  This might take a while, but I'm sure if I meditate on the idea long enough I'll develop some sort of useful apendage.

       Joe and Heish call me and say they're coming over. We putz around my house for about 5 minutes before we decide were "going out." To them, going out means driving around for hours whining to each other: - "What are we going to do?" - "I dont know... There's nothing to do..." waaaaaaaah - "uhhh!!! It's an intersection! Which way should I turn??!!" and so on, and so on, ad nauseum... There would be nothing wrong with that if it rarely happened, but it happens pretty often and it always happens the same way. I keep telling them to give up. There's nothing to do in Glen Mills when the sun goes down except hang out, and they don't want to hang out. They're too good for hanging out. So instead they go driving around complaining that there's nothing to do. And God help them if they stop and pull the fuck over and actually go in a store or place of business/gathering or something! So, as usual, we ended up driving around for an hour, winding up circling several parking lots, and not ending up anywhere. I've told them several times and I'll tell them again. They need to give up. Nighttime in Glen Mills sucks. All there is to do is hang out; talk, watch movies or TV. That's it... Or you could leave and go somewhere. But don't leave your house at 9 pm and dillydally wondering what to do when you plan on honoring your 11pm curfew. What the hell is so bad about hanging out? (they’re not the kind of guys that do stuff either. They aren’t the type to hike or go shooting/hunting. They don’t like bowling anymore. They don’t want to bother other people…). Every week they do this. They get in the car and run the same routine expecting some sort of neon-lighted oasis of fun to plop down in the middle of the fucking road and bring them in to end their boredom. They need to get a clue or get creative.  The thing that really pisses me off is that I’m sure as soon as they drop me off they bitch about me like I was the one that ruined the evening.

       I wrote a list of things that disgust me during work today because, well, there's nothing else to do there: - judgment and Criticism. It doesn't always bother me, but most people suck so bad at it or are in no place to judge, so that drives me up the wall. - Narcissim. There is always a time and a place for this. And like the other things that bother me, some people just suck at it or have no reason to think this way. Also, most narcissists are focused only on their good attributes and completely ignore their vices. They make no effort to improve. - Sensitive people who are offended by unpleasant truths. These people either need to find their own planet, deal with shit, or kill themselves. - Law school students. They're probably the most dim-witted group of people there is. - Teachers. Teachers have power, entitlement, and personality issues. They're generally all bad people (I'll even put my sister, a teacher in that category, because I'm not one of those sensitive pussies I mentioned above). I've had four so far who didn't act like the others and actually were what teachers should be. (Mrs. Debby Knox, Ms. Debby Knox [they're two different people, odd enough], Mr. Snell, Mr. Vapnairek) - People who make up their minds before they hear an issue (Conservatives, Liberals, Republicans, Democrats, all that stupid shit) - I find nothing more unattractive--nothing more repulsive (and I think I speak for all men who aren't swingers)-- than a female who talks openly about being attracted to different guys. The more often the worse. There is a difference between being a sexual person (after all, we're all sexual... except for Kenny Warder) and talking like an idiotic whore. Somehow, somewhere along the line, women got the idea that talking about guys (within earshot of guys)-- swooning over them-- is OK and actually will help them get guys. I've got news for you Slutty McGee; that couldn't be farther from the truth. It goes along with their dumbfuck notion that "maybe if Guy A sees me flirting like crazy with Guys B,C, and D he'll get jealous and want me." It doesnt work that way. It's a disgusting personality trait. It shows no class. It makes you look more pathetic and desperate than any guy could ever manage to look, and the only guys you can land with that tactic (if any) will be just that; guys-- not men; not intelligent, honorable, respectful men, but guys-- fat, bloated, dumb frat boys who only want their cocks sucked. - Niggers. Now, I don't mean black people (and I think you're a [subliminal]racist, piece-of-shit human being if you think that's what I meant). I love black people. What I'm talking about are those ignorant, lazy, uncivilized, murderous, apathetic sacks of shit who don't have decent jobs, try to dress like rappers, adopt the latest inner-city black lingo, and spend their paychecks on rims and spoilers when they really need to be buying their illegitimate children food and diapers. Actually, most of the niggers I know personally are white.... Fo' Rizzle? Yeah, fo' rizzle! :-\. - The recent abuse and misuse of the word "random" (seems to be most popular among goths). Jesus, people, learn to use a fucking thesaurus!    "... Disgusting."  I found this humorous.

        As soon as you feel yourself  against me  you have ceased to understand my position and consequently my arguments! You have to be the victim of the same  passion ! -Nietzsche  Lately I feel like I've lost the point to my existence. (Hold tight. This isn't what you think). I used to know my place. I was the angry, bitter cynic. I hated everything and always had a reason. I could analyze the shit out of anything and tell you exactly why it sucked; and I was right every time. But then, recently, something happened... I grew up. I had grown completely disgusted with my past behavior--my past mindset. But now I've changed, and while it sounds all for the better it's really not. Being the angry guy, I was always one last straw away from flipping my lid and going on a tirade. It was hard being that guy, but at least I knew my place-- at least I knew my friends from my enemies. People either agreed with me and loved me or they disagreed with me and went about their own thing. I was happy with that. There has since been a complete 180º shift in my personality. I really feel like I appreciate everything now. There is hardly a song, movie, book, TV show, radio station, or even a person that I don't like. Where I used to see only the bad in everything, I now see all the good and now I realize that the bad doesn't matter. Why is it worse like this? It's incredibly lonely on this side of the fence. Since my attitude evolved I've realized that I can't talk to anyone anymore. Conversation is the hardest thing in the world because it's almost always based on "this is great/this is bad." Too many people hate too many things and I think that's crazy. It doesnt matter how much myself and another person agree on something; something will always come up that they hate and I will not be able to stand such a closed mind. That kind of attitude, I now feel, is incredibly juvenile. I feel like I'm too mature now and I just can't deal with that stuff. I want to be able to share everything that I think is great but I can't do that because no one will let me. Everyone is too judgemental,  too opinionated, too angry, too bitter, to dumb, too naive, and those who aren't too dumb are too blinded by their own narcissism and personal philosophies to see that their own intelligence doesn't matter (not to mention it's not too impressive and not too useful). We all have our specialities, our tallents, our "fields of expertice." One must learn, though, to embrace them and nurture them without flaunting them and trying to make others feel subordinated, because they're not, They're just different. (Granted there are some human-trash exceptions). Everyone has got something they do that's better than you, and it pisses you off when they think they're better than you because of it. To you their gift doesn't mean a thing. Superiority complexes seem to run standard issue with everyone anymore.   I am better than none of you.

       Hey, do you suppose it'll rain today?  Work today.... The moat around the bookstore flooded about 13 feet and the water was probably moving about 20 knots. The boss wasn't in. There was NO work to be done. So I sat on the leather couch watching the creek overflow and read almost half of For Whom The Bell Tolls-- and I got paid for it!... Farkin'-A Oh! and the Tranny came in! His/Her visits are always the highlight of my day.  I've been bored... I'm actually thinking about [gasp] going to the beach or something (now I just need a fuckin way of getting down there... I dont know... I'd rather go to the mountains but the weather's been too unpredictable for camping.  I'm just realizing now how much time I used to spend watching porn, and I'm totally shocked... Back when my computer was in my room I must've been averaging 4 hours a day. It's been a month since my computer's been in the basement (read: month of no porn or masturbation) and I've almost completely lost my sex drive. After surviving this long I feel like I've reached a level of enlightenment or something. Any consideration I've given sex recently  has been purely philosophical, not.... what it used to be. Maybe this is like the delirious confusion that ensues after hypothermia sets in... I'm parched in a desert of involuntary celibacy. Maybe I just need sex to get thinking right again... Or do I? I don't feel like that.  could somebody please explain to me what the FUCK is up with Lindsay Lohan?     1. She just turned 18, and look at those tits. Not only are they disgustingly fake, hell, nevermind. Let me just dwell on that; those tits are disgustingly fake..... you could probably use them for a bike stand. 2. Is she TRYING to look like Jessica Rabbit? 3. Doesn't she know that girls that look  that  Irish are really not attractive at all.  I would love to punch Lindsay Lohan in her $200 fake tits.

       I'm up later than usual tonight... There are a surprizing number of people online, namely; Stevie Flakes, Cate, Pode, Wang, Joe Meyer, and Dave... what the fuck are you people doing up?... it's late. go to bed. You must all tell me what sort of evil plans you're working on that are keeping you up into the wee hours of the night. also answer my reworked Bernard Pivot Questionaire (which is nothing like the original Bernard Pivot Questionaire. I'm just tagging his name on to it). Answer what you'd like: -Least favorite social group -favorite 80's song -favorite feature about yourself -you have $88 burning a hole in your pocket. What do you spend it on? - If you could resurrect one historical figure, who would it be? -Which muppet/sessame street character are you? -What is the best old Nickelodeon show? -Favorite celebrity? -Elvis or the Beatles? - What's your most notable sexual kink/fetish?  (I really dont expect a single reply to that)

       I've just been introduced to a band called  urlLink Liquid Soul . They are, without a doubt, the  tightest ,  groovin'ist , funkiest  band that this groove-machine of a bass player has ever heard. Seriously IM me people and I'll send you some of their stuff. I want you all to hear this. It's beyond incredible how good this band is. Imagine, if you will, all the funk of a 1970's Black Detective primetime action show, add on the powerful sound of the oakland soul influence of Tower of Power, without a doubt the tightest horn section ever assembled, and top it off with the occasional turntable and freestyle rap interlude. There you have, as I must say for the third time, the tightest band in the history of music. This band exceeds "well oiled machine"-- they're a Silicon fucking Chip!...(I'm still not doing them justice... not by a long shot) Please, folks, you need to shake your asses to this stuff. Contact me and I will GLADLY hook you up!

       I'm standing in my kitchen looking at my dad and my uncle, Donald. Both are within about 7 years of each other. They're standing there talking, and as I study them I see that they both have this disgusting I-look-like-I'm-40lbs-heavier-than-I-really-am, distended, acid reflux bellies. They both look like they're hiding dutch ovens in their shirts. They're both in relatively good shape for their ages, but it doesn't show. Shirtless, they look like gorillas. You could lay them on their backs and they could hold a cup of loose water in the concave space between their chests and stomachs (xiphioid, I am told, is what it's called)... I don't want to end up looking like that.  Theres a crying baby upstairs... it's annoying.

       Where are the cicadas? Four months ago I was promised swarms of biblical proportions-- plague-like swarms of cicadas-- for the summer. Where exactly are these things hiding? Millions of cicadas were supposed to be occupying single acres. Cicadas coating the ground like picnic blankets, three inches thick on the roads causing a slippery goo to form under tires. When the story hit the news a curious hysteria ensued, as people thought Jesus-Shit, This is gonna be fuckin horrible but pretty damn cool at the same time... You could almost hear the minds of countless boys and young men dreaming up makeshift flamethrowers, some more elaborate than others, but all for the same purpose. You could seriously feel them thining that... Now where are the god damned cicadas I was promised?!!!!

       Today was nothing short of splendid. I woke up at 9, sat around the computer til 10:30, then went with my grandfather to my uncles house to go swimming. I sat by the pool in the sun drinking mudslides and Yellow Tail shiraz, reading a book and eating a prosciuto, salami, ham, and sharp-provolone sandwich. I read about 50 pages and then went swimming. I swam some laps, got out, had some more wine, and read a little more. Around three pm I had my first dinner of the night; vermicelli in a very traditional, verry light oil and tomato sauce, and a large glass of Chianti as I talked with my grandfather... Came home well exhausted from swimming laps (only about 5 laps... I told you I was a cardiovascular pussy), polished my shoes, and went to my barn patio to read some more. I come in to find another open bottle of Chianti on the counter. Don't mind if I do... The second bottle wasn't as flavorful as the first, but still good-- had an unobtrusive taste with a mild bite, so it would go well with just about anything beef, bread, or red (tomato-y)... Now time for dinner #2; the Boston Butt my dad has been smoking all day, some panzanella, roasted peppers and whatever else... Life is grand

       Haven't shaved in 4 days. Look like George Michael... yuk... My face is all itchy.  urlLink  I don't believe in God  (grew up wanting to be a Roman-Catholic Priest til I was about 13, ironically enough), but last night, again in a half-sleep state, I started thinking that I should pray more. It used to be such a big part of my life. It was therapeutic; talking to yourself, you don't cover much, but talking like there's someone else there, you learn more about yourself. Not having faith, you don't go about your life thinking that your actions dictate your fate, so you end up enjoying life less, thinking way too much, and really doing a lot less. I need a counterweight to that, as crazy as it sounds. I've lost the ability to NOT be an analytical prick. I need to go out and enjoy myself.  I need to start meeting new people. I'm tired of doing the same old shit. None of my friends like to "hang out" like most people. You know, just get together to watch TV and talk-- have a laugh. They want to make plans of what they're gonna do, so they can end up not doing them and playing old nintendo games instead or going through a yearbook and asking me what I hate about each person... I don't care who it is anymore either. There was this girl that tried to get friendly with me. Sure she was cute, fun and all (hell, she probably would've fucked me too), but that didn't matter. She was dumb as a fucking brick (and her father was a nuclear engineer. How's that work?) and she did too many drugs. I didn't need that shit... Now I don't care. I'll settle for anyone new and fun-- unpredictable.   and I need to stop posting so early in the morning.  Me and Kris were talking about how great the old Nickelodeon was. Remember all those great shows?:  - Hey Dude - Wienerville - Are You Afraid of the Dark? - Guts - Pete and Pete - Wild and Crazy Kids - Rocko's Modern Life - Stick Stickly's summer show - Ledgends of the Hidden Temple, with Kirk Foooooggggggggggg - Double Dare - What Would You Do? - Ren and Stimpy - Roundhouse (so horrible) - All That (I can't believe I made my parents sit through that shit) - Snick (and Snick on Halloween was the shit! I used to skip trick-or-treating just to watch it) - Ah! Real Monsters - That show where they used to put the kids in the video games am I missing anything?

       (It's late now... for me at least... so fuck spelling and grammar)  Due to the insane weather patterns of the past 365+ days, I'm unable to put an approximate date to this story. It happened within months of The EXTREME BOWLING NIGHT™ Fiasco, but I'm not too sure whether it was before or after...  The story starts out as all of my embarrassing stories start out; with Johnny and Kris and I getting together to enjoy the unseasonably nice weather. We wanted to take a walk, as usual, but where? That's when Johnny suggested a "secluded" hang out he frequented that he called "The Cove." Kris and I had heard of it before, and showed no interest, but that particular day we had both taken our stupid-pills, so naturally we agreed to go and let Johnny lead the way there. "no one knows about this place... There's rarely anyone there." Johnny said as we walked our way down Wawa road to the Womens' Shelter, from where Johnny said he knew of a path or shortcut. We approached the hill which the Womens' Shelter sat atop and followed JW into the brush. Of course, I took an extra dose of my stupid pills that day and (uncharactaristically) left ill equipped for our short little excursion, bringing only a pocketnife and a waterbottle. So there we were, standing infront of about a mile of sticker bush... Come to think of it, it must have been September, or late summer, because the wild raspberries were fruiting and I had to explain to John that, not only were they not poisonous, but they actually tasted better than farm raised raspberries-- especially on Philiadelphia Style Vanilla ice cream. We managed to work our way through the labyrinth of thornberries, and make our way to train tracks, coated in a porous volcanic slag, which Johnny gave us a brief but interesting geological history of. I forget why the tracks were coated in it though-- probably had something to do with water runoff. As we walked down the tracks-- Kris and I recreating the "Lollipop" scene from Stand By Me, and myself expecting to see the decomposing body of young Ray Brauer as we neared the next bend-- Johnny described "The Cove" as he had done a million-trillion fucking times before: "It's awesome. It's an open area with a cliff. You look down and there's a huge drop to the water, where there's a big lagoon. There's creeks and streams all around and huge areas to swim." All the while, I furrowed my brow in my usual skeptical way (this look seems to have pasted itself to my fase, as I use it so much). How could that shit be here in Pennsylvania, I thought. Right here, less than 5 miles from the house I've lived in for 13 years, and I had no clue about it... I didn't expect a word he said to be true. Then we approached a large clearing, where from the distance we saw a group of young gradeschoolers, a dirtbike, and a few young 20-somethings drinking and smoking pot. We weren't sure whether the kids were with the 20-somethings. I had wanted to fall back as soon as I heard people down the path, because, as Johnny had described the place, it seemed like no one but guys like us or troublemakers would want to hang out there. My intuition told me to turn back, but the stupid-pills... We approached the group. "You girls goin' fer a swim?" Hotshot shouted at us., Johnny all the while trying to look like the toughest, most in-control 120 pounder he could manage to look like-- Kris, just being Kris. "No," I said, trying to be as brief and neutral as possible (I was fuming mad, because I knew what this was going to turn into, and I knew in my gut before the day started that this would happen.) "We're just hiking through." "Come onnn!" coaxed Captain Wife-Beater, swilling the beer can in his hand and wearing his best shit-eating grin. He wanted to give us a hard time, and he knew that I saw what he was thinking, which made him want to give us even more of a hard time. "Come onnn! You fucking bitches... Stick a finger in your pussy and jump in!" He must have said that five times because he thought it sounded intimidating or something, though all it did was prolong the awkwardness of the situation. Had I been alone, I may have been able to hike on through, or even stop for a breif conversation and maybe had a beer with the guy, but I was with the two biggest asshole magnets the town of Glen Mills had ever seen-- the situation got more uncomfortable. Johnny was trying to convey some sort of image, but fuck knows what it was. For christ's sake! All he was doing was acknowledging the awkwardness and showing his discomfort and lack of control-- Kris was just being Kris. And Wife-Beater saw this and played off of it some more. I noticed the kids standing around like townsfolk at high noon in an old spaghetti western, waiting for the showdown. Wife-Beater directed me to a ledge. I looked down, sure enough; there was a huge drop to the water, a big lagoon, and creeks and streams all around and huge areas to swim.  I'll be damned, I thought. "So jump in! Do it. Take your shorts off, stick a finger in your pussy, adn jump in!" Catch-Phrase said to me as I read on his face that he was planning to either push us in or steal our shit when we disrobed and jumped in. Johnny was getting ready to jump in and swim, but fuck him, I was leaving. I walked away, and Kris and Johnny followed. 30 yards passed under us as we heard a clicking at our heals, and I knew I didn't mistake tap shoes for my hiking boots. Mr. Sugarwalls was throwing rocks at us; so were his (ironically) stoned girlfriend, and some of the kids. Great! This wasn't over. They were big rocks, and the guys aim wasn't bad, so we hastened out of sight-- Shebop and his posse of white-trash followed. I could hear them on our trail, and since confrontation was the last thing any of us wanted (actually, Johnny still wanted to swim and get his clothes stolen), my friends relied on my ninja-like steath and evasion tactics to keep us out of sight. Dr. Jellyfinger and his gang weren't going to try to fight us or anything like that, but they were definitely going to be a pain in our asses, and I was more afraid of that. I lead us down a hidden fork and hid us in, as luck would have it, a patch of stinging nettles, as the punks passed over the bridge above our heads, oblivious to our whereabouts and making teasing cat-calls. After a while we found a trail and followed it to a sign... and a parking lot... "Yada-Yada-Yada- DARLINGTON WOODS-bla-bla-bla" the sign read. I stood there choking back my verbal attack as I realized the "supersecluded Cove" that Johnny had led us to was actually a state-fucking-park (not to mention that sticking to roads would have gotten us there quicker and easier than fighting our way through the raspberries). I saw a road and wanted to walk it to see where we were. I walked it a bit, then crossed it to take a piss on a hill-- Johnny and Kris stayed back. Though I wanted to continue walking down the road, the two dimwits called me back, and being just as dimwitted, I crossed the road again to yell at them that I wanted to find out where we were-- and just in fucking time too. Professor Fingerbang and his crew of lumbering fools were making their way up the trail looking for us. We were off the trail by about two feet and in some thick brush, all bunched together when we heard them coming five feet away. I just sighed and made an attempt to turn back to the road-- I just didn't give a shit any more. Just then Johnny decided that he didn't want to pretend to be cool, calm, and collected. He must have been tired of trying to look tough, like we weren't being stalked through the woods by a malicious wigger with an overbite. He wanted to be scared now, and what a great time for that. He flailed his arms at a thousand RPM and pushed Kris to move to the road. Kris, in turn, pushed me, and in his stumbling he managed to step on the heel of my slip-on shoe, removing it from my foot. As I fumbled for my shoe Johnny continued his flailing but added to it a high pitched squeal, like that of a frightened rat. Frank Wank and his merry men were just standing there, their jaws dropped in a stupified awe. We made it to the road, Johnny and Kris panicking. We stood at the road for a bit as our pursuer heckled us from the brush... He didn't need to do that. I was already humiliated enough.

       There's this unreal phenomenon that occurs on this blog, almost like a law of blog-nature, that says: anything Nick posts on here having to do with his plans for the immediate future will not happen... Of course Matt didn't come over. Of course I didn't go to the concert. Of course I sat around with Kris all fucking day watching TV. Of course I got the stomach virus my parents had the last 4 days... Of course I'll probably shitting myself senseless tomorrow.... Of course. Because I posted that I was actually going to do something other than sit here and babble about boring shit. 'Fucking figures... I really need to brush my teeth. I drank like 4 glasses of milk today and they feel all plaque-y. Don't you hate that milk aftertaste in your mouth that you get when it's been an hour since you've had milk and you haven't had anything else since?  I'm going to try a little experiment with this plan-negating blog phenomenon, bear with me: - I am NOT going to make much money this year. - I am NOT going to get a kickass laptop. - I am NOT going to get a girlfriend. - I am NOT going to have fun this summer. - I am NOT going to spend time looking at colleges. - I am NOT going to get a good night's sleep tonight...  (hopefully the converse of the above will happen)

       There is nothing to talk about. Ciro has run out of things to say, what's the deal with that?... The planets must be in syzygy or something... Matt's supposed to be coming over with his new Schecter to jam. That sould be fun. Then, hopefully, we'll see  urlLink Modern Bliss  tonight in Newark, DE....  *woo*woo* [that would be the noise the Stones make in "Sympathy for the Devil"]  I'm stealing Cates idea of putting the comments on the top of the post, cause I think that will make me cooler.  I just remembered that Johnny was in Hawaii with a dislocated shoulder. It was funny how he was just floating in the pool with a dislocated shoulder and I tried to give him medical attention, call his parents, and make sure he didn't drown or start crying like a pussy, all while Kris and Dennis stood there, walking in circles, mouths agape, looking like a couple of fucktards. He dislocated his shoulder the night before his 2 week trip to Hawaii and he has to get surgery when he comes back... that has really gotta suck balls.  Christoph's computer broke, so he can't get online. There's no way I'm calling or mailing Germany to talk to him, but I need to plan my trip there for next summer. It should be pretty kickass. I'm going to abuse the shit out of him and make him take me to every European country I can possibly visit in a month. Must eat the entire continent!... It might sound sad, but I'm honestly not interested in the girls there at all. He just wants me to visit to  party and drink. I just want to go for the food. Oh, the food!  I have a thing on my elbow that looks like a burn, or a zit, or something... it hurts like a bitch.  guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!  I guess now is a good time to talk about THE DERBY EFFECT (to appease Kris). You see, there is a derb, a big derb, a big big derb, that you got's ta hug and squish da big derb. His name is Stephen Derby, and he is, among other things, a fat, amiable, squishable, bitter, cynical, crazy racist. Picture a caricature of a big fat chipmunk, then make it look more human, and put it in a NY Giants sweatshirt and big, greasy glasses, and you have Derby. And when I say squishable, I mean squishable. He's just so fat and jelly-like that everyone who meets him  has to squish him. There's just this effect The Derb has on the brain. You must squish the big derb. Must hug the big derb. Pinch his cheeks. Give'em big hug. Ahhh, the derb.   There's simply no other way to describe it.  Squeezing the Derb close to you has a chemical affect on the brain, releasing endorphins and skyrocketing serotonin levels, leaving the squeezer in a blissful euphoric state. Scientists have been unable to explain the effect, but much progress is being made. As we speak, Du Pont technicians are working on a formulaic explanation of The Derby Effect. "There's just something... good... about giving that fat racist a big, loving squeeze... We're actually working with Pfizer to encapsulate The Derby Effect and market it to treat depression." Derbulous secretions are non-narcotic and actually function as anti-oxidants.

       I've been reading  urlLink "A Walk In the Woods" by Bill Bryson . Just blew through 80-something pages this afternoon without even considering the time. This is definitely the funniest, most entertaining book I've ever read. The only thing that's made me laugh this hard is  urlLink "The Incredible Ryan's Steakhouse Story"  (actually, nothing's ever made me laugh harder than that, and I'm not a huge fan of that kind of humor either. I don't know anyone who's read that and not cried laughing... I've read it multiple times and by the last page my stomach hurts from laughing so hard.)... So AWITW, very clever. Bryson's transitions from sounding like a PBS-History-Special to side-splitting narratives quite seamlessly. I haven't read anything like it, so it's a fresh change. I highly recommend it, but don't be daunted by the first chapter, it can be dry. The rest of the book is hilarious.

       Here's a corny joke that gave me a chuckle.  A store that sells husbands has just opened in Ottawa where a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men. The store is comprised of 6 floors,and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper scends the flights. There is, however, a catch, as you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you can not go back down except to exit the building. So a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband.  On the first floor the sign on the door reads: "Floor 1 - These men have jobs" The woman reads the sign and says to herself, "Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?" So up she goes. The second floor sign reads: "Floor 2 - These men have jobs and love kids" The woman remarks to herself, "That's great, but I wonder what's further up?" And up she goes again. The third floor sign reads: "Floor 3 - "These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking." "Hmmm, better" she says" But I wonder what's upstairs?" The fourth floor sign reads: "Floor 4 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the house work" "Wow!" exclaims the woman, "very tempting. BUT, there must be more further up!" And again she heads up another flight. The fifth floor sign reads: "Floor 5 - These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak" "Oh, mercy me! But just think... what must be awaiting me further on?" So up to the sixth floor she goes. The sixth floor sign reads: "Floor 6 - You are visitor 3,456,789,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping Husband Mart and have a nice day."

He's got to be the most dramatic sonofabitch in the world. When he's a little cold he makes it seem like he's been dying of brain cancer. He's got a case of the Green Apple Splatters now, and he's talking with absolutely no tone or energy, like he's dying--Ever see The Count of Monte Cristo? Remember when Abbe Faria died and his lungs were punctured, and he was talking all wispery like he couldn't breathe? That's how my dad's talking, only he's worse... He walks around like an old man, mumbling everything and trying to make it look like he's been on chemo or something... he's such a pussy. --- I love the speaker setup on my computer... It's so badass... 2 sets of Cambridge  Soundworks speakers (4 Mid/Tweeters, and 2 POWERFUL subwoofers) and a $400 set of JBL media 4's (2 pro-audio speakers with super-high tweeters and  mids on each, and a bigass sub)...

       Well, some of you may have guessed that I've now been keeping a notebook by my bed. So most of these ramblings are sleep inspired. The more insensitive the rambling, the more awake I am (see my post about death, if I ever decide to post it). So what was I thinking of last night that stopped me from going to sleep?  I want sex... not wild, sweaty, animal sex... not passionate lovemaking... sex... The real kind-- fun, goofy, walk your ugly ass around naked to get a sandwich during coital-intermission--sex. That's the way it should be, sure; sometines serious, sometimes hot (with two "t"s), but generally is should be about having fun and possibly having a laugh. Bill Maher once said something like "There are only two pure things in life-- Two pure feelings-- Laughter and Orgasm. Neither can be faked very well (and neither should be faked)." The best would be combining the two, laughter and orgasm. They are the purest feelings. They are what make us human. Why not enjoy them both at the same time?  Why is my mind--Why are all our minds-- so driven by sex, when it's no more fun or interesting than anything else [no more fun than what we make of it]. Maybe its because people put too much pressure in it. I don't know anyone who's had good sex. Both partners are usually too bashful and everyone complains about it behind their lovers backs like it's not remotely their fault. It is their fault though, but it's not something they should be ashamed of. It's everyones fault. Just open up, have fun, and laugh.  Does my being driven by sex have anything to to with my being single? Is it really just sex that I want?... I don't think it is... And what's with those tantrists? Why would they want sex to last for hours? Is it the intimacy or something? Can they keep it fun for that long? Otherwise, sex should be an hour, max. I gaurentee you'd get bored after that (If not, drop me a line :-) )... You strip. You hump. You switch positions a few times. You hump some more. You cum. You clean up. You're done. It's not like mowing the lawn; where it takes a few hours and each time you do it a little different to see how to go about it most efficiently, and which way is easier on your back. It's just sex... Sex with virgins is worse than no sex at all. I never want to do that again. No one knows what they're doing. Everyone is afraid to try anything. It's always a fiasco. Even worse when both participants are virgins. So, what are your thoughts (or do I even want to know)? How do you like it? ---- "Waiter! There is too much pepper in my poppykosh, but I would be proud to partake in your pe-can pie :-)"

       There was this... uh... "he-bitch"... for lack of a better term that used to come into the bookstore. It was tall, about 6', had long black hair, wore womens clothing and womens clothing accessories, but had the face, voice, muscle definition, knees, shoulders, and adams apple of a man... It wore makeup though... We were never sure if it was a transvestite, a transexual, or just a really, really unlucky woman. It was the kindof gal a trucker would give a mayonaise jar to open, the kind of guy you'd go shopping for pumps with... Totally indescribable, but so peculiar... I hope it comes in again...

       I've been reading For Whom The Bell Tolls (excelent book. Hemingway reminds me of Tarantino in a few ways), and I've been thinking (maybe if you've read the book you'll know what I'm talking about); Robert Jordan and Maria basically fall openly inlove almost immediately upon meeting eachother. Realistically, did/does love ever happen that way? We are led to believe that in the past that's really how it used to happen. People just met, at the right place and time, and telepathically consented to love each other until they both die. And they did! And it was genuine!... I don't think I buy it though...How can you love someone you've just met? What is the foundation of the relationship? Can you love someone regardless of their personality, their intellect, and must it have been looks that attracted you to them in the first place? Suppose you're too different, or maybe worse, too similar? Or is it really possible in the first place.... Are they the responsibilities of a love that died at the birth of the information age? Can two people who want different things love each other respectively, realistically, giving each what the other wants? Is it a positive plus negative thing-- yin and yang-- must there be balance? Or, must the scales be tipped?... I guess that would be true unconditional love, but do I believe in that? Does it really exist?... Do I even care? Fuck... I'm not even 100 pages into the book yet. I shouldn't be thinking so much. I just got the urge to watch old nickelodeon shows, like Pete & Pete. I don't know why... I want that "Noggin" channel. NP; Lenny Breau and Chet Atkins

       Ok so I'm the member of this message board, and we get occasional posts about people who know people that died and I just don't get it... Here's the most recent. a few minutes ago i received an email saying that this girl i knew in college, erin schlather, died in a car accident on monday morning. no other cars were involved - she evidently hit a guardrail, and then flipped over into a ravine filled with 4 feet of water. i don't think they've yet determined the exact cause of death, i can only hope it was quick. i wasn't extremely close to erin or anything, but i remember her well, since she dated one of my good friends for awhile. she was an amazing singer, and was pitch in one of the a capella bands at vassar. she was smart too - recently she had been working at the non-profit center for strategic and international studies (CSIS) in DC, and was about to start law school full-time at georgetown in the fall. but mostly, i just remember her being one of the sweetest, kindest, most adorable people you could ever care to know. as someone who, luckily, has not had to deal much with deaths of friends or family in my life, i never know how to respond to this type of news. so i started this thread. RIP erin be safe out there everyone.  ok... Look dude... I really don't care about Erin. She's just another statistic to me... What? Oh, shit! Erin Died!? on the road?!... I'm gonna be safer now.... seriously, what the fuck does this accomplish? and then everyone responds "I'm sorry dude. I bet she was a wonderful person"... Hell, I aint fucking apologizing for anything. I didn't kill the bitch. And just because she's dead doesn't mean she was a good person... I'm sure that's not what people on another message board were saying when her ex-boyfriend told his internet-buddies that she cheated on him. Erin was probably a bitch. Not only do I not care about Erin (and you said yourself she wasn't a close friend, so why do you care?), but I hope you get diarrhea for expecting me to care and expecting me to apologize...   People, you all need to realize that death is a natural fucking process. Just like having a baby, just like cumming, just like taking a shit. It happens. Get over it. I can be sympathetic and compassionate when the situation calls for it, and this, most fucking definitely, does not call for it. Nothing Erin, or any of your dead friends (unless then invented some goddamned vaccine) ever had any affect on me. I never knew 'em, so I don't care... Now, if your infant child has cancer, that's another thing. That I'd feel for. Or maybe if a tremendously significant person in your life dies. But give me a break with this "someone I know just died in a car accident." That's just one more out of the thousands, Bub.

       First things first. My hair looks cool as shit today. This is probably because I haven't washed it in almost a week (now I probably reek of hair, which I think is a good smell.). It's all messy and looks like model hair... God, I sound like such a girl in this blog. Someone needs to kick me in the nuts to make sure they're still there... DERP!  So I've managed to shrink down to 137lbs now. Still I feel kind of chunky, but my sense of logic is telling me that's impossible, being 5' 6" (d'oh!) and having this big, mellon head of mine. I'm certainly not lanky, even for my height. I've come to think that while my chest is large, the majority of it's size is due to the structure of my rib cage, which is probably larger than usual due to my unusualy deep voice (which I've noticed today is getting deeper, and considering I'm done growing, and not twelve fucking years old, that shouldn't happen... I also noticed that it's changed a little to sound like I've smoked a lot and drank a lot of whiskey. idk). I think I'm starting to get a starvation belly from only eating one meal a day. Yay, now I'll look like an Etheopian.... I need to start jogging... wait... fuck that. I'll just buy some cutting gel. --- enough girlieness Well I'm back at the bookstore (Widener University School of Law campus Bookstore, Wilmington, DE) for work this summer. I think that makes 6 years now. It's really a great job. I come in at 11am and if we don't have a shipment coming in I just hang around, read on the leather couch or in the shady courtyard, and get paid for nothing. The people I work with are all fantastic, crazy, blue-collar Americans-- a great lot. When I'm working I'm usually unloading truckloads of books (thousands and thousands of them... Books, not trucks.) on huge palats, in massive 80lb boxes, in the summer heat-- it's a great workout. There are lots of perks to working at the bookstore. Ever August, before classes start, we get crates of "Campus Trial Packs" filled with studious amenities, like candy, gum, Nyquil, Dayquil, Shampoo, Deoderant, Combos, tampons, and condoms-- everything a college boy/girl needs (I can get you a box too, so let me know if you want one. We just give the shit away so it doesn't matter that I take whole crates.. This offer stands unless an assload of people ask me) Of course, I always take at least one case of 75 trial packs... I haven't bought deoderant in at least 2 years, and if I take any more I'll have a lifetime supply of condoms (considering I'll probably never get much sex... actually, I think the 70-something I have now will serve as my lifetime supply... Or as my pal Dave Gardener told me; "Now you can jerk off without making a mess!" Sadly, he's probably right and that's probably the only use these little fuckers'll see)  right... I'll be back later with other boring shit

       Do you GV folks remember that little arrogant douche bag Adam Makinnen? Possibly the worst musician I've ever heard (that goes for counting all the toddlers I've heard playing "In the Jungle" on their Playskool 5-bell keyboards) got rejected from every college he applied to... Like shitty colleges... West Chester.... now he has to go to DCCC.... now I'm not one to seriously smile at the misfortunes of others, but this kid was just such a twat... so I had to make his personal business public in my away message, and then in my blog... Drop me your thoughts... I personally think, just becaus the kid was so full of himself with no reason to be, that he deserves it.  any time I see an away message with a song lyric my immediate reaction is to not look at it... Anyone else like this?  NP (or soon to be playing): Curtis Mayfield- Pusherman, Superfly Barry White- The Best Of Tower of Power- These guys are the funkiest band of all time. Phenominal horn section, excelent vocalists, and the deepest grooving bass player of all time. Creators of Oakland Soul... if you havent heard them you  absolutely have to check them out (What is Hip, Down to the night club [Bump City], Soul with a capital S, You're still a young man, You ought to be having fun, So Very Hard To Go)... I heart this band with every inch of my body... even  my peepee ;-)

       Masturbation all but ceases to exist when you remove your computer from your room. Can love be  made ? Can sex be  had . How about breakfast, lunch or dinner, can they really be  had  also? Can looks really be  given  or  begotten ? Semantics- a wonderful, crazy animal... Don't you  see  what I mean? Or does my point  elude  you?

       I find myself complaining often as I lay in bed- You need a girlfriend- then I realize that thinking is too simplistic. What you really need isn't a girlfriend but a companion, I grumble to myself subconsciously. To often to I go through this routine at night telling myself; sleep now, it is late and you will need rest for tomorrow. But I don't need that rest. All throughout the day I am to my own devices, which usually means I'll end up doing so little that I'm unable to recount the days events even before the day has ended. Of course I blame this on myself, but why? I've decided I need new friends (not to replace my current friends, but to make more *authentic*, symbiotic, creative friendships... and I wouldn't do something as chickenshit as telling my friends to fuck off over the internet.). My current friends are too wide and varied, and I keep them all mostly for a single attribute to their characters. There are many different groups and sub-groups, and none of them seem to like each other outside of those groups. I've got jocks, Jews, skaters, gamer-nerds, punks, politicians, metalheads, counterculture philosophers, cryptozoologists, and musicians, but no one of I feel I can really have a real friendship with. Pardon the attitude, but I'm just too damn sophisticated for the people I know. I love them all, they're all fun, genuine, great people, but...I think too much. I'm to creative, too philosophical. I need someone to bounce ideas off of, get into deep philosophical discussions and share debates on all topics from music to politics all over a friendly cup of espresso-- someone who appreciates and understands food like I do-- I don't have that. I can't argue with my current friends about why Pro-Lifers are wrong, or why, while God doesn't exist, religion is still quite necessary for some people, or even why Oreo's must be dunked-- I can't get into any existential debates with my friends. I'm left with my own thoughts and I don't want to end up like the closed-minded, idealistic hermit I'm headed towards becoming. My friends are simply there for shits and giggles, as am I. I need intellectuals. I need older, more mature friends. I can't be bothered with this teenage drama bullshit, I've got more important stuff on my mind! I swear, my friends talk about sex and it's like listening to a group of prepubescent girls talk during a pajama party! I happen to have testosterone running through my veins, boys, don't try to drag me into your myth and conjecture-based sexual discussions. I don't want to explain to you how babies are made! Well there I go, ranting about my friends when 1) I like them, 2) they're not the problem. I just want a friend with at least half of a clue of where I'm coming from. Somwone who doesn't ask "Whoo?, Whaaaa?, why, dude?" when I tell them I'd give anything to play "Sir Duke" on stage with Stevie Wonder, someone who actually pursues a discussion when I start talking about Wundtian Philosophy, Hemmingway, or government mind control, instead of just responding with "Hey, remember that time we were lost in the Alps and we ate your legs for food?"... It's not that I'm tired of that shit, it's that I'm tired of still not having the kind of relationship I want. Now, I may sound too serious, and that might sound bad, but right now I don't have time for frivolty. I want to meet someone who I can  afford  to be silly with-- someone who can balabce out the silly with the serious and vice versa. Then I can be silly, but I need security first. I'm sick of being a goof and getting nothing in return. All this sounds like I'm depressed, but I feel fantastic. I haven't depressed in over a year. I've actually never felt better, aside from this cold I have (Who the hell gets a cold in July?). I weigh as much as I did in 5th grade, I'm reading more than ever, I've been coming up with great recipe ideas and eating better than ever... Things are actually great, except for my situations with my friends and my computers. But the things that are shitty are SHITTY, and I think I should have control over that, so I'm gonna try to change my situation. -can anyone relate to shit shit?  (and don't go giving me that "grow up and quit thinking you're so smart" bullshit. It's not like that. I'm not one of those wannabes! One of those jerk-offs that takes AP classes and talks about themselves and their academics like they're hot shit, and then they end up going to some barely-above-half-decent college with 20,000 other kids like them! I've worked as hard as I needed to and it's not like I'm bragging all the time about dealings within the clique of my AP classmates- because there are none- I'm not one of  those  cunts!)   Now Playing (people should use this more often. It's interesting.): Jackson Browne-Pretender, Runing on Empty, Stay, Doctor My Eyes Stevie Wonder- Isn't she lovely, As, Sir Duke Hall and Oates- Rich Girl, Maneater, Sara Smile, I can't go for that.

       George works at CompUSA George "specializes" in Macintosh systems George had my computer for a week and was instructed to fix it for $100 George just gave me back my computer George didn't fix my computer George, if he even touched my computer, made my computer worse. George still has my $100, but that doesn't matter because George is going to get fired if he doesn't fix my computer for free.  Right now I feel like that duck... in the cartoon... hitting the computer with a mallet. Why?--  [geek speak] ok. So I've grown up a mac guy. For reasons I don't feel like discussing now (which actually make for one  fucked up  story), I've come into possession of two PowerMac G3 clones, a blue iMac, an Apple Mac G3 with a G4 processor, about 10 keyboards, and about 15 monitors (about 6 of which I threw out). These computers were top of the line back around 1996. They were beasts, maxing out at about 500Mhz, some having 24x CD-RAMs, and even one DVD-RAM (which was too old to play DVD movies, only used for massive storage).... For you window users who may not know; Macs can only be updated so much. After about 5 years Apple makes so many advances that they stop making new hardware and software for their older computers and they only focus on the newer groundbreaking models. These computers are almost 10 years old now. Anything that can be done to keep them in working shape has already been done. In an attempt to stretch a year or two more out of them I tried updating the software a little... Bad Idea... Apparently, mac clones don't like being updated and now both of the clones lost their systems-- they're completely useless now, and not worth the money to get someone who knows more about clones to install a system on them. I'd like to fiddle with the hardware but my dad is paranoid that I'll *break the computers that don't work and we didn't pay for or put any money into*... I'm stuck with a strawberry (pink... motherfuckers) iMac til I can afford a laptop...   and how the fuck is it already 9pm?!  I gotta think of something interesting to write

       Good writing is concise. It is forward and to the point. It is sincere and it is powerful. There is, however, another form of writing which goes along with my writing/english as music idea. Just as there are shredders on guitar (the guys with big hair who play a million notes a minute but manage to say absolutely nothing with their music), there are verbal shredders. The kind of people who ramble on incessantly, trying to see how many words they can fit into a simple sentence that could otherwise be shortened to three words, and without making any significant change to the sentence. We are all familiar with Patrick Henry's speech ending in the line "I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death." Notice the simplicity and power of the line. Now take the shredder version:   It would be difficult, if not impossible, to predict on the bassis of my limited information as to the predilections of the public, what the citizenry at large will regard as action commensurate with the present provocation, but after arduous consideration I personally feel so intensely and irrevocably committed to the position of social, political, and economic independence, that rather than submit to foreign and despotic control which is anathema to me, I will make the ultimate sacrifice of which man is capable-- under the aegis of personal honor, ideological conviction, and existential commitment, I will sacrifice my own mortal existence.  (cred. Jacqueline Berke, The Qualities of Good Writing, Readings for Writers, 1974 HBJ, INC) Which is better? The second obviously shows a more extensive vocabulary, but does that really mean jack shit? I'm sure we've all seen chloroformic writing like that before. Hell, I'm guilty of writing like that myself just to satisfy english teachers who I knew to be verbal shredders. It sounds like something Dennis Miller would say. The ignorant bastard! But how much more power the real quote has! Its beauty is in its simplicity. It is truly heartfelt. This shredding business is trying to turn language (music and speech) into mathematics. There is no real tallent in that form of writing. It's meerley a hodgepodge of thesaurical blathering, not art.

       Music has always come first in my life. I grew up playing music, I still play music, I'm always thinking music. As I've learned to hone my musical skills I've picked up some rules-- rules that musicians should follow to ensure their musicianship is at its highest quality: -If the line you are going to play can't be hummed by a listener, or get stuck in someone's head, it isn't worth playing. It is forced and insincere. -There's more than one way to say what you want, but there is always one BEST way. -Be concise. Only play/be concerned with what is necessary. Intricacies are meaningless and only impress the naîve. Dmdim^6sus9 does not matter. It is simply Dm. -Just as a bike, a bus, and a car are all different means of getting to a single destination, technique is just a means of saying what you want to say. It should not dictate the music that you play... You drive your car, the car does not drive you where it wants to go. You control your music, do not let the rules of your music control you. -There is no breaking tradition, there is only evolution. There was a point when tradition wasn't tradition. There are people who want to keep it bebop, but at one point bebop wasn't tradition. People like Dizz and Bird were really streatching it. -People ask "How can I learn to improvise [better]?"-- They don't realize that they most likely improvised that question. They werent thinking nouns, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, etc. You say what you feel, but it's because your vocabulary is big enough that you have a lot to choose from, and you can actually make sense with what you say. Improv is about building a musical vocabulary so large, so well, that you con't have to think about what you're trying to say, you just say it. When you do think about it it's like walking; when you think about walking you trip. (I could go on and on with this)  Music is a language, as any other language. From being a musician, from following these rules, I am able to find my voice. I take this same approach to my other native language, English. When I write (and talk, in most cases) I try to use English the way I use music. I try to be musical. The most important thing is sincerity-- Am I saying what I truly feel? Am I saying what I truly mean?-- Without sincerity all other skill, all other conventions are useless. Speak from your heart and hit them in their soul. With music you can't just go back and unplay what you just played, nor should you if you could. It's about the moment, as cheesy as that sounds. It's about how you feel and what made you feel that way, right in the context of then and there. That is why 90% of all my first drafts end up being my final copies. I may go back and change words but I still try to keep the exact feeling I was shooting for in the first place. There is a place for eloquence and there is a place for absurdity. For instance: A jazz concert is no place for the sazophonist to get up and take a stand-up comedy solo. However, there are instances where what you say or write can and should be [terribly] out of place. Doing this can work to accentuate or reinforce what you are trying to say. It's like how many heavy metal bands incorporate acoustic guitars, and even orchestras, into their music. It makes for a more profound effect. Finally, and most importantly (to my style) is my use of grammar and punctuation. Almost always, I will say something a certain way (ie use a specific word, or use a certain conjunction) because I mean to do exactly that. You'll find lots of alliteration, repetition, and odd/unconventional comma use (among other punctuations) in my writing, and it's usually there because that's exactly how I want it. It makes things sound rhythmic and adds a tasteful melody. But, I never intend to sound lyrical, only musical-- melodic, rhythmic. I picked this up from jazz pianist/composer Dave Brubeck, who used words, names, and lines of speech to write melodies for his instrumental songs. Just like in music, every word has a timbre (colot), but that color can depend greatly on the words/notes preceeding it and following it. Each word has its own feel-- a staccato, a crescendo, a cascade-- it's all a matter of finding the right one for what you have to say and how you want your readers to feel.

       so, I skipped taking my AD[H]D medicine the last three days... Mistake. I had a glass of black tea around 10 pm last night... Mistake (those of you who know me well know I can't handle caffeine in any amount) the above two factors led to my staying up til around 5:30. Some of you may not think that's so bad, but past 11pm you've got to be dead silent in my house...  So I'm looking out my window at the indigo sky at 5:30, then, without even blinking, my eyes open to see an orange sky at 9:45... I was most likely abducted by aliens. That's the only theory I've got to account for this missing time.... Ok, so I had a rough night... I'll probably get to relax today, right? fat chance...  Retardo Montalban calls me at 9:45 to come over and help Will put gutter guards on the gutters... It must have been 500ºF on the roof... I'd developed a sore throat, and from overeating nonstop the last three days, I'd gotten a funky stomach... so baking on the roof didn't help.... I'm supposed to be reading or writing something near-valuable now, but I feel like carrion.

       {{edit}} it's amazing how many spelling/grammatical mistakes I make when I don't take my ADD medicine.  I'll buy you some sex if you tell me what NARB is an acronym for. (I'm just going to keep going with the shit below. RAPIDFIRE-- anything and everything that comes to my head) - I have yet to meet anyone who frequents a dictionary as often as I do. - Right now my burps taste like diesel exhaust. - I've never had GOOD sex. I assume zero responsibility for this. - I don't know what I hate more: sleeping or waking up. - Ali G gave the commencement speech for this years graduating class at Harvard. First I was offended. Now I think it was brilliant. I used to hate him... Now I get the guy. - I'm not sure whether I want sex or a relationship now. I know I want a little sex though. That would be nice. - After much practice on this, I can finally say I appreciate almost all music... I still can't stand those contrived soulless bands like Guster though, but they don't count. - I think my parents think I'm gay because I like shoes... I'm not gay... I do look at shoes with the hungry eyes of a young man oogling a porno-mag though, and I've got over 10 pairs, but still... - College: I either want to major in cullinary arts (I know I have the potential to make 90% of all food students look like idiots), or do I want to double major in English and a natural science (I'd love to get into a pure science but I'm not mathematical enough). I know I want to get my doctorate  in at least one thing. I'm not sure what though. - I consider Funk, Soul, and R&B (the real R&B, the old shit, not the new "KC and JoJo" bullshit. That's the furthest fucking thing from R&B)to be one genre, which I would call R&B. I believe it is the most emotional, most human(e) genre of music. It is ubermusik. - Extraterrestrials have been among us so long they should now be considered Terrestrials like us. - I want to use that Veet bladless shaving foam shit for womens' legs on my face. - Internet radio hosted by Live 365™ sucks. - The enemy of my enemy is my ally? The enemy of my enemy is my enemy? - Dick Tracey was more phenominal than Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but I wouldn't say it was exponentially superior. - This is for all you overly sensitive people who seem to get offended by everything: Dyke, Nigger, Fistfuck, Smegmal Toothpaste, your dead grandmothers cunt... coitus.... - If you tell me Bobby McFerrin is not a musician but a vocalist I will stab you in the eye with my index finger. - If I had a pet I'd want somethign that could climb, but not throw it's own feces... A ferret. I'd call him Ferrets Bueller... or a squirrel... I'd name him Django. - I'll admit I got a hardon for a lot of girls at my school. I'm very open about it. Everyone knows about everyone I like, except the one girl I'm absolutely crazy about. It's more than just a crush. I've never said her name to anyone before. I've never talked to her before...I think she knows who she is... I'm a loser. - No, I am ubermensch. - I've lost a total of about 80lbs in the last 2 years, most of it in the last year. I went from 220lbs to 140lbs. I'm technically underweight and I have between 10-16% bodyfat according to the most high tech weight gizmos, but I still have a little fat covering everything up. This pisses me off cause I know I'm ripped as a motherfucker under all that shit. - I am a cardiovascular pussy. It's embarrassing. I can benchpress more than my own weight, squat a refrigerator, do about 70 situps in a minute, but it would probably take me 10+ minutes to run a mile. I have the lungs of a 50 year old smoker. I blame that on catching pneumonia 3-5 times.... and being obese for half my life. - I don't have a thing for fat chicks. I happen to like girls the way they  should  look; no ribs showing, slightly meaty with small-medium sized love handles, like a Reniassance painting.... Slavic (Russians and Poles...) girls hold their fat the best, then Itailain girls. But meaty Italian girls look like a sack of cottage cheese when they get older. - Any guy that doesn't like cunnilingus should reevaluate his sexuality. - we're all a little bit kinky... some moreso than others. - this did not take the direction I wanted it to take. - I swear my mom has the hots for me. - I am Mr. Morning Person, but that's not to say I'm not a night person. I just feel that the day moves too fast if I wake up past 8am. The slower the day feels the more I get done. I seldom wake up before 11 during the summer. - I can screw up a whole months sleep cycle by taking one nap. - My 70+ year old grandfather says he's never had a headache or been stung by a bee. - Ben Folds is the Beatles/Billy Joel of the Me/X Generation. - My english teacher is the most attractive and best teacher I've ever had. I wont call her hot because she isn't, but she happens to have the most attractive personality I've ever encountered and she's intolerably cute. - "Shak" is quoted often in the dictionary. Someone please tell me who Shak is. - In ninth grade I washed my hair less than five times... the whole year... - I've changed (physically, socially, idealistically, and emotionally) more in the last 500 days than most people will ever change in their life. - It's the eye of the tiger... - People who violently shake their heads while listening to fast music (I'm not talking about headbangers here... *shake*-like they're trying to follow the music or something) and people who pretend to be conductors when listening to orchestral/symphonic music are the ones who know the least about what they're listening to. - Messing with another man's automobile is the most chickenshit thing you can do, just ask Vincent Vega. - People who don't like Tarrantino's movies don't understand film. That's all there is to it. - I'm a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker, but I really do enjoy a good cup of coffee. I don't drink coffee because it makes your breath smell like ass. - To have bad breath, IMO, is the highest of all offenses. People who don't brush or floss often piss me off. - The jelly in your eyeball is called vitreous. Those little translucent knots of stringlike stuff you see floating around sometimes are just parts where the vitreous congealed- they're commenly referred to in the optometrical field as "floaters"... I have lots of them... I hate them all. - The vulva is too glorious an organ to allow something so rediculous as penis envy to exist. - nothing I've said so far is the least bit interesting or relevant. I should be shot in the ass for that.  -I should finish the story I was writing  -- Leave a comment. No matter what it is. No matter who you are. I don't really have a reason. Just do it.

       It was around the eleventh of October, 2003, that the incident occured.My mother made me my favorite dish for my sixteenth birthday dinner, Lobster Fra Diablo (Lobster in a light, spicy red sauce over linguini). I had invited my then-girlfriend over, for the sake of putting her in an uncomfortable position, as she hated eating dinner with my folks. We chowed, and I, being the fat tub of shit I was at the time, ate a ton. The tails of the lobster had an odd texture--stringy and tough. They probably weren't cooked enough, but that didn't stop me from eating them. Post-gurgitation, we decided to do what seemed like every single person with a means of transportation decided to do that night-- visit the Regal Cinema megaplex. After waiting in line the four of us got tickets to see About Schmitt, staring one of the finest actors in the history of cinema, Jack Nicholson. So, we get into the theater and, naturally, my parents and my girlfriend and I separate. The 'rents take to the lower theater and the girlfriend and I motion our way up to the top (this theater had stadium seating). We find ourselves at the top row, which is completely empty, and she takes the inside, her left shoulder to a wall. I take my seat next to hers and prepare for the movie. There is a slight gurgle in my stomach but I feel that if it is ignored it wont bother me the rest of the night. After a short wait the movie starts and I fix my eyes to the screen... It's getting quite hot in here... The movie picks up and I'm enjoying it... here comes that *gurgle* *gurgle* again... I start to sweat as pull my thick sweater off and preemptively cover my lap with it to dampen the deadly farts, which I can feel coming. Maybe that's all it is, I say to myself reassuringly as I release the first blasts of radioactivity from the depths of my gurgling stomach. The movie progresses, and so does my gastro-intestinal situation. What was once just discomfort now evolved into pain, a tolerable pain, but a pain nonetheless. As the forty-five minute mark passes all hell is unleashed in my stomach. That's it, I say to myself, I have to shit and nothing is going to stop me! I turn to my right to get up and exit the theater, and what do I see but five ENORMOUS, overweight black people. These were big motherfuckers, and there were at least five of them blocking my way out of what I now saw to be a packed theater. Even if I got them to stand up so I could leave their guts would have been too large to let me pass. So, thinking that I only had about forty-five more minutes left of the movie, I decide to tough it out (more like I was obligated to). My habitually taciturn tract of intestine comes alive as the lobster gets his revenge. My Stomach, growing angrier now, moans like a banshee as I dance about my seat-- stuck-- between a wall and five soft places-- stuck. The cauldron of hell churns, froths, and bubbles in my gut as I writhe in indescribable agony. By now I have no doubt turned green with sickness, and as each second passes I grow more and more impatient. The sweat on my forehead is beyond the beading point. It pours out profusely, salting my eyes as I visualize myself as king on my porcelain throne… I concede to myself that I may not be able to win this. I may be left with no other choice than to let loose where I sit. I felt defeated, but I still had fight in me yet. 100 minutes up... When will this movie end? I don't even know what the movie was about, as I could not have paid any mind to it. Had I diverted my attention my seat would have caught fire as the volcanic death of my core unleashed its fiery being. I absolve a few boiling breaths of sulfuric crustacean to the tin-bottomed seat beneath me, toxic-breaths of which, if introduced to flame, would undoubtedly beset an unbreakable weld a'tween my cheeks. 125 minutes and the film finally ends. I suspect it was great, as there was an ill reaction from the crowd of fat idiots who surely only went there to occupy ninety minutes of their time. I pray for everyone to stand and exit the theater as fast as they possibly can as I attempt to take to my legs while not allowing the lobster to gain the upper hand (I was wearing my favorite pair of pants-- green moleskins-- and I'd be damned if I were to let the lobster beat me and claim them as his own!)... Blast! Just as I feared, the bathrooms were all full. So I tell my crew to fly! To the minivan! As fast as you can possibly move, you all must get me home!  My clothes are saturated with the toxic sweat that is now flooding its way out of the pores on my livid face. The sickness is almost unbearable now and I slip in and out of a poison-green dysphoria. I grind my teeth as I breathe the hot, recycled, food-scented minivan air. Finally! We make it home. The lobster in my belly has not managed to claw itself out yet. Oh, what a wretched pain! I stumble my way up the heavily trodden oak staircase, nearly pulling the railing out of its bearings on my way. I reach the summit of the mighty mountain of stairs and kick open the door to the bathroom with my already bare feet. I strip naked at ludicrous speed and enthrone my seething red body on the cool enamel seat. At last my ordeal is over! I brace myself, drawing a breath and entering a dreamlike state of near-meditation. NOW! I unleash the fury! ---  The coup de grace:  I lift my disrobed body off of my cool, pale friend, and apologize for the burden I have bestowed upon him. It was all now a surreal memory, taking material form only in the black, star-speckled vastness of space, which my porcelain throne, served as an ocular to. My ordeal was over. I emerged triumphant. I lay my weary hand on my silver sword and watch as the dark matter spirals away into infinity. I was the victor, but I still await the day when my adversary confronts me again, for now I am prepared. I have pepto bismol, and I sit in the aisle seat. The Lobster will not stand a chance next time.

       With enough influence and practice anyone can write a clever, witty critique, a spin, an analysis, a review, whathaveyou. Try creating something out of nothing. Don't leach off of others' work. Write a story. Make it about  something , then when it's all over and done with be proud of what you've created. I'm in a funk right now. I need a change of direction. A fresh perspective is what I need. I've rearranged my bedroom, relocating my computer to my basement to allow myself to occupy my time other ways. I've started reading, and I never used to read before. I'm rewatching movies and uncovering everything I may have missed in previous viewings. I'm listening to music I used to say I hated. I've been trying my hardest to appreciate all art (film, music, literature, and the  art  you're probably thinking of) for the good in it rather than the bad, so I've stopped hating everything other people have created (unless of course ignorance was involved in the creation process). Because of this I've developed, for the first time in my life, a true sense of respect for people as artists (respect towards individuals as human beings is another thing). Nothing has  clicked  yet. I know it's coming though. {{ I wrote a lot here, then I decided it was booring, so you don't get to see it.}}

       I'm waiting for Kris to come over so we can go to Riddley Creek State park. I might as well post something. I watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time last night with Heish. Heish was super-pissed with Nurse Rachett, reminded me of my reaction the first time I saw it. God Damn! What a great movie that is. It's got to be the best movie I've ever seen, at least my favorite now. I'm listening to The Beatles now. I think it's hilarious how within the last year they've gone from the band I HATED the most to probably my favorite band. I think I just finally get them now. I used to be such a dick, thinking that there was actually  good  and  bad  music, and the only music that was  good  was music that exhibited supreme instrumental proficience (which at the time, to me, meant speed and complexity). Lennon and Harrison weren't shredders, McCartney didn't write fugues, and Ringo didn't play like Max Roach, but I'll be damned if that means they're not a fantastic group. ok... gotta pick up Kris  NP: The Beatles - The White Album  Big Country - In a Big Country (mmmm.

       I just got back from Borders. I went there to get a book on grammar (Check out  Eats, Shoots & Leaves . Looks great), then I realized I only had $7. What can you buy with $7 anymore? So I was walking through the aisles (or whatever) and thinking: There are A LOT of books. Have you ever really thought about how many books there are? Think about it, then add an exponent of about 5 to that already unpronouncably huge number for every book that isn't in publication anymore. It's wild. I figure that, at best, only 60% are well written, and 70% are worth reading. I started reading Chaucer's  Canterbury Tale s, and I just don't get why people want to "keep it classical." I'm not saying it's bad, just that I personally don't understand what joy people get out of  trudging through texts so archaic it takes a day to read a page. There are progressives, those concerned with the future of things, and there are regressives, who ardently push old conventions because they are  right  or they are  the way it should be .  There is no right or wrong, damnit. There's only what you like, which is all that matters. Leave the people you don't agree with alone. Regressing back to Chauceric language won't help us colonize other planets faster. Hell, it might make everything go slower. So you think that Dante's Divine Comedy is great? Great! But don't complain that modern writing doesn't resemble it (There probably are writers that write like Dante but they probably don't get published, and for good reason; it's not what people want to read today.) The same goes for any sort of regressive: Just because it's new doesn't mean it's bad, and old doesn't necessarily mean good. It drives me nuts hearing people who only listen to classic rock or old jazz say that today's music is bad. Today's music is no worse than the music of era you choose to listen to, it's just different (there are always bad artists). Without progression everything stays the same, there is no reason to live when everything's the same. Everything is a chore then. Everything is predictable. Where is the joy in predictability?  I'm out.  NP: The Beatles - Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence.

        A man walks down the street    It’s a street in a strange world    Maybe it’s the third world    Maybe it’s his first time around    He doesn’t speak the language    He holds no currency    He is a foreign man    He is surrounded by the sound    The sound    Cattle in the marketplace    Scatterlings and orphanages    He looks around, around    He sees angels in the architecture    Spinning in infinity    He says amen! and hallelujah!           ---    The other day I was up late. I apologize to whomever I spoke to for my spelling and the lack of sense I made. I was falling asleep as I was typing.... Guys, I've figured out what makes Mrs. Knox so hot. It's her impeccable grammar... at least, that's what does it for me :-[ derp...    ----    I never saw the Xanga GV Blogring until Cate brought it to my attention. Bastard! The blogs in that ring are so horrible they almost make Johnny and Kris' look good (  almost  ). I got physically sick reading that shit. None of those people should be alowed to have blogs; they're either too boring, grammatic eyesores, have no personality... Fuck it, they're not worth my attention... They've totally ruined my oppinions of two really hot girls, and one that aint bad looking.    Guuuu    ----    Greg, the campus security officer, just asked me:     "Ah-eweinnakih-wihPAT?"    "What?"    "Ah-eweinnakih-wihPAT?"    "Am I in WHAT with Pat?"    "Ah you innakih..."    "In the WHAT?"    "Innakih-- you know-- Ahyou relatet' to'uh?"    "Oh,   in the kin  ? No, I'm not..."    Greg is very black and very southern, both accents and dialects on top of each other make for such an otherworldly garble that one would be lucky to recognise that he is trying to speak English. What is it with these people who, when asked to repeat themselves, repeat what they said the exact same way they said it the first time; same metre, timbre, and tempo? Can then not understand that there was a reason why they were asked to repeat themselves? Do they think they speak with such eloquence that their listener asks them to grace their ears with such marvelous words a second--third--fourth-- time? Worse yet, they use the same damn words as they did they first time. People get locked into hearing a certain word the wrong way and no matter how many times you say it they'll think you're saying something else... Say it slower. Articulate. And rephrase, God Damnit! ----- I'm thinking about growing a goattee or something thereabouts. I've tried it before but shaved it off after a week. It gets to a certain point where you feel like an ass; you may look good with a four-day growth of beard, but between the fifth day and until it starts looking like a beard, you look really, really stupid. It's a pain growing the shit, too, because it itches like a muthafucker. My blonde friends try to grow facial hair and it drives me up the fuckin' wall. I can't be seen with them because they look too rediculous.  Not only do they not have enough facial hair to grow it out, but they're fucking blonde, and unless you look like a Viking, blonde guys shouldn't have beards. It looks stupid.  Thoughts? Should I? Shouldn't I? ------ Dave, my boss, whistles way too fucking much. When he's not talking, or sleeping (I assume), he's whistling. He tries to whistle along with the radio but he's the most tone-deaf SOB in the world. He has NO control over his pitch and only has a slight understanding of what tempo and rhythm are (fast or slow. That's all he knows.) but that doesn't stop him! ------- They played Timewarp on the radoi today (Other than Fat Joe's  Lean Back , Timewarp is the only dance I know... But I didn't dance. I was too busy overcharging some Indian guy for his book). That made my day. I want to see it in theaters this Halloween. -------- Enough with this "Stop losing weight" bullshit! Some people, every time I see them, keep giving me this bullshit "Nick, did you lose more weight? You look skinnier than when I saw you last week... You need to stop losing weight." Can't those people turn on their brains for five fucking seconds just to realize how fucking annoying that is? First of all, no I'm not losing weight, you're just standing farther away this time. I haven't been fat since last summer, you don't need to keep addressing the fact that I used to be a fat pig. Second of all, while I may be technically underweight, I could still stand to lose a few pounds of fat so my godly abs would show. Hearing the same old shit over and over from different people is fucking unacceptable. I'm going to start wearing a shirt with a FAQ on it...

       I watched Woody Allen's  Sleeper  tonight with Heish. Woody is brilliant. It was almost like  Fletch , with the quick witted remarks and blunt sarcasm. Hilarious. I spent the day at work working on some stories for my fiction blog which you'll have to ask me for the URL. They're a series of short stories titled  Stories You've All Heard Before . They're clichéd, overused stories that have been told millions of times-- events that probably really happened to some people-- maybe with their own little twists and quirks. True pulp fiction, in the litteral sense of the term, not in reference to the film. My fiction writing has a certain Cheese Factor to it, so I thought I'd go for the cliché stuff I've heard a million times and try to rework it (shit, it's made million$ for other authors). Right now I'm feeling that they'll all settle around a Hitchcockean theme of bad, unusual things happening to good, normal people, but who knows, I might write something different.... I've got outlines of two stories written and I'll get to writing the actual stories soon. in the mean time..... ghurhghrthhfhkehehhlflapghraaaarghhhhhmlllplop.  Oh!

       The Campus Trial Packs came in today and I took two cases. This year’s suck; advertisements, coupons for Campbell’s Chunky Chili, Chicken Ramen Noodles, Clearasil Lotion, and Nyquil and Dayquil (add tampons for the female version). No deodorant, no candy. And the exterior of each box is a big Sponge Bob…oh, and there are condoms in each one. I don’t know why they would put rubbers in a box with a child’s cartoon character on it (people usually take those things home to their kids thinking there’s nothing but candy in them). Now I’ve got 150+ condoms and nothing to do with them. Whenever my brother is home he is sleeping. He’ll nap all day up until dinner, then go to sleep at 8:30. By that time I’m usually tired of being on the computer and I want to do something. My only two options are go out or play my bass/guitars. Working at the bookstore only pays once every third Monday, so I don’t have money to spend. Going out is useless (plus I don’t have a destination, since most places close at 9 on weekdays), and my room is right next to his, so I can’t play music. Is it my brother’s fault that every weekday of mine is ruined? You might have heard that hell froze over. I might be getting a cell phone soon, just to have around.

       I am the greatest thing since sliced bread... I truly am. I have a killer ass. I talk like Barry White. I'm hung like a mule. I dress great. I'm totally unpredictable and unreadable. I'm an excelent musician and I'm fucking brilliant. If I'm not saying something profound I'm saying something hilarious (or at least entertaining). I cook like a motherfucker. So, why don't I have a girlfriend? Don't tell me it's because of a lack of modesty, 'cause I don't say all that stuff often (of course it's true though). I saw a lot of couples in NYC and it pissed me off. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to find a girlfriend. Is Glen Mills cursed or something? Do I just need to start  trying  (because I really don't want to)? It's not like I have rediculously high standards or anything; I'm just looking for someone with a female reproductive system who's close to being my intellectual equal (in either direction). It shouldn't be that hard to find a girl who's a bit unconventional, who can balance the scale for me by bringing in some color and variety-- someone who's unpredictable, fun, openminded, and knows how to appreciate things the way I do. Is it because I only want something serious that I can't find anyone, or is it that I just hate teenagers? I've got a handfull in consideration, one seems smart enough and is damn good looking but I'm not sure about the personality, another's got all three (and then some) but probably wouldn't even consider giving me the time of day, and the other's are just eye candy. I have to say, this area has a horrible selection of women. And the ones I like all go for my opposites while the girls I'm repulsed by (or at the very least, afraid of/not interested in) seem to flock to me. Now, I was not designed with the most modern interpretation of "good looks" in mind. I honestly don't think I'm a bad looking guy, but I'd say my looks are more  classic  good looks, not this new pretty boy shit. I happen to look like a man, an intense Italian man, with angular features and a body shape that makes one able to tell my gender, not like some walking clitoris like Orlando Bloom or one of those nancies. Just so happens that what nature decided should be attractive to women isn't attractive anymore, at least not to the ones I'm interested in. Instead they like the opposite; small, scrawny guys they can push around, with little or no muscle definition, long hair, and girlish/boyish faces. They don't want a man who's going to be good with kids, be a good provider, be good in the sack, or interesting to talk to, they want "cute" guys to cuddle with, snuggle and coo, and not share a single fucking shred of intelligent conversation. They want soneone whose gonna be a total pussy and over-dramatize everything. What a deep fucking relationship that is. I need to get started on my fiction blog. Hopefully work wont be busy tomorrow.

       Right. I'm just gonna get this out of the way because I want to start writing/posting other shit. The rest of the NYC trip: - NYC has the worst waiters in the universe. - NYC is not nearly as hostile and unwelcoming as people make it out to be. Actually, compared to Philly, NYC is for pussies. People were polite, they tried not to get in anyone's way, and kept to themselves. The streets were not scary. Traffic was not bad. And I was very disappointed with the Taxis. They were all new, fancy, and had leather interiors (I wanted the dirty shit I see in movies). - I saw a helluvalot of the city and I don't think there's really much to do there. There's probably more to do in Philly. You start seeing the same stuff over and over. One Armani Exchange per square mile is more than enough. - Cate, the trick to becoming The Ultimate New Yorker is to not try and become anything. As long as you don't walk everywhere with your head tilted towards the sky no one will suspect you as a tourist. The place is so diverse that there is no reall local way of acting. - China Town is filthy and has bad sidewalks. I must've tripped five times. - I think I'd like to live in NYC for a period of less than a decade. - Matt really is as indecisive as I say he is. - Joe is the King of Inconvienience. - on the train ride back some 400+lb, gray bearded, suspender sporting, straw hat wearing, couch potato farmer sat across from me (next to Joe). He said he got on the wrong train and didn't have enough money and was trying to get back to Georgia. He had an unusual gurgle to his voice, he mumbled, and he talked like the indecipherable farmer from  The Water Boy.  He seemed well read though. He commented on  The Crucible , which Matt was reading, and was familiar with the Garrison Keillor book I was reading (and was a listener of  The Prarie Home Companion )... Interesting guy.  - I had a great time and I'd do it again.
