Damn tired, but onli around 3, going to stay to twelve midnight...  later on ate steamboat and picked up birthdae cake 4 cheryl (gabe's sis) her 21st birthdae on 16th. Everyone else was busy eating so i had to go...both cakes were choc...got thorougly sick of choc...nothing much later on, counted down to gabes actual bdae at twelve...got home at one exhausted.  Don't feel too good...too much sugar perhaps...and bushed. Ugh...

      Dedicated to all those with bad results...   ~Cheer Up Peeps!~      Self Portrait   He filled up the palette He laid out the paintbrush He set up the mirror He painted.  He filled up the water He laid out the dry rags He set up the easel He painted.  He painted his face, ears lips nose and the windows of his soul. A masterpiece.  he painted his hair, brown black gold and the curtains of his soul. A masterpiece.  Stepped back, admired, Sigh of contentment. But wait, something's wrong, Creased brow.  He missed out the faults, Pimples, scars And the blackness of his soul. A blemish.  He filled in the acne He painted the freckles He drew in the uglies Stepped back.  Lo behold.  A masterpiece.  "It is a part of me."

      -dove-   'My  hair  was like a bale of hay, it was really scratching against my skin. But when i started using dove, it became soft and silky. It was like giving my  hair  a milk bath.    dove is the only shampoo that contains one moisturising cream to nourish and moisturize your  hair ...yada yada   The other night when i was out drinking, my friends asked me:"Why do you keep on touching your  hair ?" I didn't realise I was playing with my  hair  the whole night!   I just couldnt help it!'  It is interesting to note how interesting it sounds when you replace all the "hair"s that appeared with a censored sound (i.e. *toot*)...   Another one starts off like this...  When i was in Paris for two months, i had no time to take care of my  hair . It was really dry and scratchy, and like,   limp, and dead.  That's all folks!!!

      I have come to realise how important a happy family is. Without a happy family no matter how much fun you have at the end of the day you will return to troubles and quarrels that will plague you. On the other hand no matter how bitter your day is your family is always there to support you, or at least give you some space to yourself to chill out and reflect. So remember to treasure the happy moments you spent with your family members no matter how insignificant something seems, like eating and chatting around a table, or watching tv together...preserve the bliss in your family!

      i have juz watched...       Matrix Revolution       and the ending ROX!!! I dunno who said it sux but methinks it rox...okae   WARNING: Spoilers don't read any forther if u haven watch or dun blame me for ruining it...         Firstly lemme give my point of view...Neo DIDN"T die...as alota peeps think he did...lemme explain...  you see when he exploded in the matrix world as agent smith, tt was only in the matrix...his body remained intact in the real world...and yah i m disputing the theory tt zion is in the matrix...tts not rite...the real world IS real...and remember when he went blind he could see the fiery orange outline of the machine programmes? I m quite sure that represents life, or perhaps electricity generated from the human body. It is proven by the fact that when Neo saw the claw grasp the capsules with the human body in it to attach it onto the tower which extracts power from humans in the AI city, it is glowing brilliantly, the capsule with the human. It is also the colour of the sun, and also the complimentary colour of the green flowing letters which represent the matrix, symbolic of the opposite of AI: life. And when neo so called died or lay motionless after the battle with smith in the real world on the source's platform, he was glowing brilliantly with light. This shows that he is still alive.   And the peace between the machine and the humans is mutual. If u didn't catch the exchange in the final scene with the oracle and architect, the oracle asked the architect if those who wanted out could get freedom. The architect said yes...exact words:  "do i have your word?" "what do you think i am? Human?"  This means that those who wanted to be free will be, but those who wished to remain in the matrix to have an easier life but sacrficing freedom will remain as human batteries... Yupz, and also the oracle said she suspected we would see Neo again...and she's always right...  Also, why Neo could destroy the sentinels and anything machine related is also sorta explained...he could reach into the AI source and control it. In the exchange with the counsel member in reloaded, the counsellor asked him what is true power, and the answer was the power to turn it off. (they were in the engine room or power plant or something of zion) The counsellor also added that if they turn the machines off, issit really wise? becoz without the machines working, Zion cannot survive, thus highlighting the theme of symbiotic relations between the two. Neo has power over the machines in that he could turn off the "switch". Why he could do that however is juz explained as because he is the one.  There r also many other theories tt tok about the french guy and smith being one of the ONES, and that Zion is another programme with neo trinity and morpheous being programmes to lead anamolies, the 1% of the human race who dun believe in matrix to ZION so they can be destroyed easily, but i believe that is not right because if so the oracle and the architect will know about it and yet in the final exchange they r saying tt Zion is in the real world, and there is finallly peace, so that disproves tt...  those who want a good arguement or more theories, come find me...if u r still reading i commend you on putting up with my thesis essay on the matrix...oh wellz...after all i am a lit student

      heyz everyone, concert is OVER!!! If u haven caught it, then i will finally tell you, truthfully, that it was very good. According to our conductor, 2 musicians in the audience thought we were quite brilliant in 2 songs that were rather difficult, and everyone loved the second half with pop songs and christmas carols...so if you missed it, well too bad...th audience also clapped at the correct time for once.  During the period of two hours just b4 the concert i was rushing out the concert poster backstage...it was quite a killer i tell you. Forst in the morning and afternoon must go to marine parade to a photo shop to print the poster out and must pay 20 bucks for that...then later rush to mph and popular to buy decorations for the poster, which will be placed at the door. Another 20 bucks there. Then later rush to VCH to do the poster. he mounting board was too big so must cut, then cut until very ugly somemore, cos i only had a lousy thin pen knife. The later paste poster on, add ribbons leaves and whatever, i was sooooooo happy when i finally finished it. They liked it alot, so it was worth it. So all the CCAs out there, send at least one of your members to the art club, you will need him sooner or later lol.   Later after the concert met rich and dezhi and zhaoyu backstage, then went to eat with them and liansheng at cafe cartel. Ate until around 1145 to 12, played truth or dare, lots of secrets revealed....no details, i am sworn to secrecy...too bad louis weren't there...ask him to go dun go....nvm next time? hahaz. Cannot grill him. Then later must rush to catch the last train. so cham. Reached home 1230 to 1 am...lol  Yersterday went to cousins wedding...got alot more coming up. This is the third wedding i attended his year...got bout 3 more coming up lolx. All my cousins getting married....arghz. I feel so young....i got so many nephews and nieces already...now i feel so old...lol. Tiday woke up at 230pm...too tired from last night lolx...had diarrheoa yersterday morning also, luckily i feel okay b4 the wedding....

      I have just watched Never Been Kissed, the second time, and as the first, it was amazing. It was amazing how much of life it discusses in the story, and how much I can relate to it. As always, it is a romance story based on high school, yet not totally. And it has lead me to realise how much high school, or sec school to JC in our case, can teach you about life.   Life at our stage seems to be very shallow at first sight. Yes, we have friends, we have our stereotypes, the sportsmen, the popular guys, the funny ones, the good-looking ones, the wierd ones, and of course, the losers. The nerds. We all play a role. Those at the bottom scramble to get to the top. Those who fail will remember it as a scar for life. But usually everyone forgets the bad part of high school they went through, only remembering the good times, but theres something you are missing. Something big. No matter what you experience, good or bad, it enriches your transitional stay in this phase of life.  Alot of people want to be 'in'. They want to be at the top, to be gazed upon with admiration, and to own the school. Many fail. As the movie goes, it only takes one person to think you are cool, and no one will dare to oppose it. As true as it may be, sometimes it is just so hard to make it happen. Just one person.  And for this one person, there are many who cries, and despairs, wondering if they ever get a taste of being popular. Of being in. They may spend hours in front of the mirror, or hours going in their heads; is there something wrong with me? Is there muck on my nose or something? Why does everyone hate me?  I just want to tell everyone, who has read up till this point, that as Drew Barrymore said, no matter what stereotype you are, learn who you truly are, and don't be afraid to live it. There are those who will always be beautiful, those that are always popular, those that are more academically oriented, and the few special people that are close to your heart. And though you will always be one of them, there will always be others like you whom you can relate to. Also, learn to appreciate not only the joys, but the sorrow that comes with life. For every bad day out of a year thrown at you, appreciate it. That is life, something which no one really understands, but which everyone experience. It is a beautiful equation of contrasts and contradictions, of sorrow and joy. You can never fully experience joy unless you know sorrow, because when everthing bad that can possibly happen, you will find the simplest pleasures intoxicating. When you a going through a bad patch in your life, the roses at the end of the tunnel are all the more fragrant. And when you can love everything you can to hate, what is there more to despair about, to fear? Such is life. And when you can take a break from it to step out and see, to reflect, that is when you can experience a different type of joy and contentment, a sort of bliss that come from within. This is what i believe.  Romantic movies are not always as soapy as you think they are. They are about love, but also so much more. They explore life in a way action movies and comedies can't.

      I got a2 for os normal chinese.  Emotions were jumbled. At first got it and i froze, then decided to juz see the results n get it over with. I saw an A. Whoa, i did not get b3. Then saw a 2. Heyz, not bad. Then i started feeling very sad... When i walked home was really like in a daze...juz walking alone, met rich n jason wong who asked for my results. Very sad. But after went swimming and let off some steam felt betta. Parents said results were okay, but i soooo want an A1. nvm. Go for all distinctions lorz lol.  For all those whu got A1 CONGRATS!!! For all whu got A2, if ya happie, then gd fer u, but those whu r sad, cheer up. More than half of singapore is dying to get ur score soget over it. Itz not tt bad. For all whu got an undeserved b3, I m really sry, but give yaself a chance and pick urself up. U DO NOT NEED CHINESE in ur L1R5, so dun b too sad. Whats wrong with taking chi in JC? U have another chance to get A1 so grab it. U'll definitely get it this time, juz continue working hard.

      Sorta bad day, but a relief off my mind.  Firstly, i m gonna fail maths test. I feel it in my bones. Horrible...got too many commitments, too little time, so i didn't really have time to study, but after analysis with ching hui, i realised that i could have made time to study more...but i tried my best yersterdae...stayed up till 12 to do all the maths practices, but couldn't do most of them, and was feeling very frustrated. So i woke up at 4.30-5.00 to continue doing, oso to help louis get the essay out...but he smsed me to tell me tt he dint finish. Still gonna fail...whats the use of all this hard work...I m gonna dissapoint myself, my parents n my tuition teacher again...i hope i get an A1 for the next maths test to make up for this one...  Then gotta do the house t-shirt design and the psgm finale board thingy, so todae got excuse frm GM to use choir time to do the design bcoz i have absolutely no other time to do it and they need it by this coming mondae which was rather urgent. The psgm board thingy will have to wait till tomolo...gonna stay back late to do again. Got hist test tomolo oso...muz study now...very tired from all this...still got art to film, and muz go all over the place to film sumemore...  Then my best results so far not satisfactory. Literature ok lahz, i got 88 for the twelfth nite one, but unseen prose which is actually seen(coz we read it last yr) got 74...dissapointment. Juz look at the other nine subbers, not that i m saying anything bout e 8 subbers, but they got scores like 24/25 or at least above 20 most of the time.   Then english. My essay got 23, which means i got a close a1. Tts not gonna pull my marks up alot issit? fail maths barely passed chi average hist...i seem to b getting worse...ohwellz...chinghui totally thrashed me in eng...  SO analysed my situation with suggestions frm ching hui on the way back home...decide tt the only solution is to mug harder...what else can i do...

      The year started off hard, and i was quite stressed, by class decor especially, the VAC, choir commitments, and academic studies etc. It was a lot to juggle, and the balls kept falling to the ground, rolling all over the tiles like little red spheres of lost hope, but here i am, out of the mess, still juggling, still working, but happier, and more able to cope.   One of more resolutions was to change the way i am, so lets list down the points i want to get rid of: -control freak I was always a control freak, juz didn't show it to some people, people who worked with me usually know how domineering i can get...so i hope i can change that. -insults i m very prone to lashing out at people when i m stressed or unhappy, so i need to watch my tongue. -Sloth I am juz plain lazy sometimes, so i need to learn to kick myself in the arse hard to get things going...  okae lets start...

      HOME SWEET HOME....wow i had a little adventure today...  went to support tennis finales, then it rained, no wait, it poured...so we stopped the game when it barely started, and then the only shuttle back to sch left without us, namely me dezhi louis, so we took 95 at NUS to the MRT station....budden we overshot the stop...so we decided to go eat, coz might as well...after intense scouring of the area and asking like 4 ppl where the nearest fast food restaurant is, and with the help of a kind umbrella auntie, we got to kfc at 4.45 liddat...like 1hr n 45 mins after the tennis game stopped...we were drenched, our bags were drenched...  so we got a breather and we ate...then coudnt do hmwrk coz dezhi forgot abt his bb thingy...so went home...at the bus stop i decided to take a riskk and took 7 home instead of 970 to the MRT station with them...so i did my maths assign on the bus, finished it, then fell alseep...and guess what? I overshot my stop again...to paya lebar...so i went to this bus stop, and i saw my cousin, Teck Jui, whus in NS, and he told me 197, the bus i was planning to take home, doesn;t go past my house, contrary to my believes...so i had to walk home from lucky plaza...luckily the rain held itsbreath, and only a few drops came down b4 it stopped again...phew...  generally it was a gd day...i had quite a lot of luck to tide over my bad luck...like meeting my cousin, the rain to allow me to do my hmwrk, etc...tomolo dun tink i'll be supporting, coz i got theory lesson which is of paramount importance to my music theory exams this sat....very scary. So i will have to write a letter....  wow, feel so relieved now... ;0

      Sometimes i dunno why i court trouble with all these projects i am doing...but most of the time i am proud to be able to do something for the school and my frens. I think tt is what is important. Its hard to cope with my work, but it'll be over soon.   Got music theory exam comin up this sat, dunno if i can pass coz got no time to study...if fail my parents will be so dissapointed and wasted all tt money...then if i channel my energy to the exam my schoolwork will suffer...in anycase i am not gonna be able to do well for the next two tests, maths and physics, and my theory exam.   had migraine, but took two panadol pills...so feeling betta now. Muz start work oredy. I hope i can sleep early tonite, or i'll fall sick soon and wun b able to concentrate in school tomorrow. Its so hard being active in school and scoring well in ur subjects as well. No wonder they have the president's scholar thingy...the scholars totally deserve it, they can balance so much stuff at once...and i m oredy dying...

Anywayz i feel so refreshed. But still got abit sore throat...haiz. Tataz for now.

      i dint knoe smiling can have the reverse effect as well...oh wellz life is contradictory isn't it? The chemicals backfire i suppose. This is one time smiling doesn't help. Defenceless. out of character for me ter do tt...really dun feel like going tomolo...coz got sorethroat oso...budden mabbe tts an excuse. U dun run away frm reality rite? So i'll go lahz. But i'll have ter see a doc soon too. Messenger is indeed a bad way of conversing serious stuff. I lose my ability to see the emotion changes and be tactful. Genial was rite. but whaddya do when ya feel maligned? apologise and hope it blows over i suppose. The thing is tt the sincerity may not be believed.   The bad thing about finding joy in little things is tt u tend to find sorrow in little things too. things tt are happening at every second of the day.   I dunno why but everytime they get close i repel them away. Its my fault. After so many years of examples n different ppl, i knoe whats the worse thing about me now. It is the one thing tht i prided myself on. Isn't it ironic? When ppl like u for what u r, when u r what ur not they will flip, coz u r tt one part of their life, and if ur gone they r lost.   I wonder how long it'll take for this hole to be filled. Will the cracks always be there?   Tact. i have no tact.

      The day was gd at first, tho have all the tests n everything. Coz there was psgm finale. It was quite a success actually. At first the board was screwed up but we fixed it. Go louis blog's to find out. I got a metamorphosis tshirt for my trouble, tts something. I really like it.  What really mattered today was finding out how hard surprises are to keep. You knoe how it hurts tt person when it backfires? I started it anewayz. I tt might happen, but it didn't stop me from trying. Start the planning too early and this is what ya get. Thanx alot anewayz ya have been a great help, juz dun feel like tokking now. cya tomolo. Sorry.

      Very confused as to whether i shuld take hcl or drop it. Still remember the day in sec 1 when we have to decide if we want to take hcl...howi insised i take tho my mother said it was risky...did i make the right choice? Its so easy to make choices for others, but so hard to make decisions for oneself.  My father said i shuld bcoz simply i m juz bad n have no time. Juz spoke to my mother however, she said i shuld take it. Rather convinced lahz. Thx louis and ivan for hearing me out, helped me alot. Got a load off my chest. Feel slightly betta oredy.

I enjoy half days more then weekends...hse meeting was fun...lotsa farni cheers and stuff...then later discussed my chi with ms ong think i'll not drop...but she seemed spprehensive about me not dropping...am i paranoid or does she really think i can't do it...  Then my inspiring light hearted speech at the atrium...yux onli got 16...so bad...nvm i enjoyed myself...lol Next kena mrs ng's sharp tongue...said my maths test was rubbish...argh i oredy knew tt...haiz gotta work harder in diffn...said i hav to go for remedial...ew...no time oredy lehz..  Then after sch did the psgm finale thingy...sincere gratitude towards louis for peiing2 me for the dunno how many timeth oredy to help do this sorta yucky stuff...thx alot really appreciated tt, muz make up ter u sometime. So i finally got the psgm huge board thingy going...it looks more presentable n stronger now...finally...now art filming...tomolo lahz probably. Btw uhu glue is really kinky...lol. And black duct tape...  Then went home walked towards mrt station, was damn farni. We were listening to Stacey's mom, and we were walking in sync along with the beat, then rite outside mrt station dropped some coins, so we had to split the ear phones, looked quite stoopid hoped no one noticed...lol.  Gambette everyone...do ur bez for the sch, and ur frenz this yr!!!

      What is life about?   Studying? Getting gd grades? Hanging out with frens? Girls? Getting a highly paid job? Exceling? Fighting to the top? Shining? Being extraordinary? Obtaining the 5cs? Getting a family? Growing old? Becoming a grandfather?  What then? Read and do gardening all day? Reminiscing the past? Spending the rest of your days with your chosen spouse?   Waiting for death?  Why the endless competition? Why the endless need to study? To excel in life...why the need to excel in life? To have a comfortable one...why the need to have a comfortable life? To be happy...why be happy? To not be sad. In the end are you truly happy?  No matter how many times the sun rises to shine, it gets swallowed by the endless night. Life is not full of ups and downs, but a constant down with little hills of ups. A straight line with humps, not a sine graph.    It is so hard to be happy sometimes. But thats my role in life. Whats urs?

      Detached.  art - the use of drawing, painting, sculpture,  ecetera to represent things or to express ideas, for pleasure of release from the bottling up of overwhelming  Screams. but what do you do when the paintbrush traps you in its bristles and the piano chips your nails and the hauntings of poets long gone, still possesses you, with ideas  Not your own?  forte - crescendo, apassionato  Con Sordini. Tanto! sforzando. piano. diminuendo. morendo. Staccato. Staccato. Pizzicato.  Scherzo.

Mrs Tay helped me alot with the concept today, yay finally got a betta one oredy, working towards it.....but haiz...so much to do!!! Not only art...then i sooooo tired.....i need coffee....but i burped oredy can taste the bile...yux...dun feel like drinking anyhing else...shuld i go for choir tomolo...not feeling too gd...feel like staying at home tomolo but missing school can kill one....

      Hey...  haiz...dun think i did enuf for art, or for an other hmwrk for tt matter...four major events coming up...house swimming carnival, art club combined training, choir camp, and cdc lai ye production....i have no idea how i m gonna coordinate all this esp the three ccas one......all happening in a span of two weeks. with all the planning starting now...hahaz.  Physics is gonna be screwed. Dint really pay attention in class, coz tired during physics...cant stay awake...and i juz dun like magnetism........guess i hafta go mug..then all the subjects suddenly so intense, rushing out topics especially maths, and art is getting more and more demanding coz with so much on my hands i cannot schedule a time to film my cousin etc coz they have their own lives too. And recently sick somemore...with ORA, cannot do alota work...  Aiyarh i guess i can still cope lahz, juz gotta focus more...gave up on watching any movies le...but gotta focus on studying...FOCUS......and of coz i still gotta do a gd job of the other stuff.......  But without all these life would be watery..whats the pt then hahaz. I'd rather have no time then too much time...like juz a few weeks back when everything was slow paced and i juz felt dead. Routine. Go school go home slack arnd do some written work, laze arnd, eat, sleep. Felt horrible. No emotions at all, no urgency no desperation, no joy, juz bored, empty. The void is really scary. I'd rather feel negative emotions than have a void.  So i guess i juz have ta juggle everything properly and stop dropping balls on the ground...hmz. I'm sure i can do it. but i wonder if i shuld go sleep now to start a fresh day or continue struggling my work out. Its too late to do animore art so i guess i'll concentrate on chemistry first.......  gd nite

      There are common tests, lit, ss n amaths tomorrow. And i havent studied finish. Swell. And the neighbours are rioting. two of them anewayz. Making a whole ton of noise. I think if they keep it up i m gonna juz burst and erupt at them. I dun care abt any gd relations anemore. what right do they have to do this?! i cant even have my maths tuition in peace. Screw them. Now i m stuck at vectors, i knoe nuts abt it, and the percentage change application is screwed, and applications of integration is not fully revised. More to go.  Ok. i wun explode. i'll blast music. i m practically shaking. if i dun blast music i think its really gonna burst out now. a loud shaddap shuld do the trick.

Today: a whole pack of diary milk choc but the mini bite size type...and finished bk6. I m starting to scare myself... i dun believe i can finish tt bk so soon. And my poor eyes...and head. Ouch.  whereas for studies? zilch. or so closed to zilch it is indeed zilch.  Not going for choir prac. If they want to they can kick me outta choir. I'll try to join art in jc then. and tt is supposing i made it to rj...  Oh yeah. This is so not worth mentioning...i passed my theory exactly on the dot.  Bah.

      Heyz!  ouch. my eyes, esp the right is sore...think i neva take care enuff...juz threw away my old contacts and bathed them in optrex solution, then rested eyes for 30 mins and opened new contacts.  Its really claustrophobic when i cant see anything, all a big blur. Not lost, but claustrophobic, like i m confined to my inner thoughts. No sight no nothing. So i turned to music...sorta worked...over worked my eyes prolly...  I once said i'd rather lose my sense of hearing then my vision, but i dunno if tts true animore...it would really depress me to not be able to draw, but not being able to enjoy music? tts worse in a way...i dunno i hope neither will happen to me...

      If life be a piece of paper, then people we meet are pencils. HB for our parents, the guides; 2B for those in-passing. 4B for friends who make your day, 6B for friends who are always there. 8B are for our confidantes, To lend a listening ear.   But love is the thing that adds colour, beautiful, lasting yet hard to erase. For no erasers can take away colour.  On your own sheet of paper...do you see color? blue, red, yellow...  But if theres one thing i have learnt from art,  is neva to tear up ur piece of work,  no matter how ugly it is.   Keep it. Change it. Edit. Salvage what you have.  have patience. An be daring.  In the end, what you'll get  is a beautiful piece of work. For no matter how abstract it is, It is what u have trusted most in.

      Hey!  my mom brought out her photo albums coz i needed them for art project...times in the past...and she told me bout her last time haha...got more insight on my parents and what actually happened last time...delved deeper into the relationships betwn my parents and my god parents...choices. Decisions. Actions. So complex...what would have happened if things happen differently? Would i have been born? hahz. Relationships. Do ppl always fail at them?  Do ppl really understand relationships and their own emotions? Am i gonna be juz another brick in the wall...another person who spent his entire life trying to find the secret to relationships with frens lovers acquaintances enemies? And failing...  How do u define a successful relationship? or issit ever changing. what would have happened if i didnt do tt? a betta life? a lasting relationship instead of a failed one.  Small actions. Dire consequences. Small mistake. Big losses. I wonder. If problems to relationships will ever be resolved.  How do u even know u are not simply lying to urself?
