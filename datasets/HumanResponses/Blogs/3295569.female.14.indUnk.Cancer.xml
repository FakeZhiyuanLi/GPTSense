      In a few weeks I'm going to Minnesota. I love going there bc everybody loves me. They are family after all. So, this time I'm staying there for another week after the family leaves bc I have all that money. I'll edit this later. I'm too lazy. Love, Chloe

      I just got a packet for the new private school I'm going to and the dress code is REALLY strict. I mean, the girls can't wear pink! We can't have heavy make-up on or short skirts. I am actually reconsidering my choice. I guess I'll have to think some more. If you peeps have any comments about it or some advice, please let me know. Love Always, Chloe

      Hey, my name is Chloe and I am 13 years old. I am 5 foot 6 inches, I have dirty blonde hair, blue eyes, and I weigh ___ pounds. I am in the 6th grade for 16 1/2 more days and then I'm going to a private school. The new school is my choice and I can't wait to go. Not only will I make a new beginning, but I will get away from all the people that I have a bed reputation with. This summer, I'm babystiing and making 550 dollars. Shopping!!! Anyways, my few true friends that I have now are Sarah, Rachel, Andrea, Tess, Kali, and that is about it. I am currently single because I just broke up with my old boyfriend. I broke up w/ him because he was not talking about appropriate things and it wasn't working out. Right now I am in a fight with two people; Madison and Missy. Missy is always going to hate me and Madison....well, I can't trust her at all. Anyways, it's 3:13 right now and I just got home from a long day at school. I am really bored. Uggh. Well, I guess I'll see you later. Love Always, Chloe
