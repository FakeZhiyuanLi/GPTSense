      On Friday July 9 I will turn 40. Hooray for me? yeah right! I guess I`m suffering from a bad case of middle age blues. All those middle age cliche crisis are beginning to overwhelm me.  What have I done with my life? Where am I headed? What is my purpose? Why am I constantly dissapointed with myself and life in general? Why does my hair fall out of my head only to return on my back and in my ears? When am I going to feel like the confident well adjusted grown up I assumed i`d become? Am I going to die soon?  It seems to me, and this is only my perspective, that the older I get the more dissillussioned I get. I`m at an age now where I know I will never be the the next great guitar hero, I will never be wealthy, I will never get to fuck that sexy young thing, I will never be the brave adventurer or award winning novelist, I will never be attractive, clever, witty or successful.  The lot I have achieved in life is one of mediocrity, achieved through a lifetime of fear, complience, obligation, responsibility and societal expectations.   So what drives me? What do I want? Hard questions with no ready answers. I do know however that I want peace of mind, I want to wake up every single day and look forward to it, I want purpose in my life, a sense of direction. I have no use for an abundance of material possesions, its the emotional aspects of my life that need nourishment. I am not driven by money or status. What drives me is an urgent desire for adventure, passion, romance, creativity, peace and love. Fucking hippy idiot? Maybe, but I`m past caring. All I can do is soldier on in the knowledge that I`m in for what could be a flip of the coin the very best or the very worst years of my life.  At present I`m suffering from a pretty bad bout of depression. What`s going to be the outcome? I`m getting help and medication in the short term, but what about long term? Am I going to come out of this refreshed and enlivened? Will it lead to the enrichment of my marriage? new possibilities? career options? New social outlets? Sustained support? Or will I end up divorced, broke, broken, unemployable, sick or dead. I have no answers and no expectations. It`s just a wait and see proposition.

      My 1st post! Welcome to me! I wonder if anyone is ever going to read this entry, or anything else that I post for that matter?  So why write here? It`s because I needed a voice that I just don`t have anywhere else. I`m just a wierd freaky little guy that blunders through life feeling pissed off, inadequate and never bothering to do a damned thing about it. Hence, this is my soap-box. The place to come and get things off my chest.  1st agenda is to address my current state of mental disquiet. For months now I`ve been feeling that I`m on the edge of a total mental crack up. Tension in my head, neck, back and shoulders. I spend a lot of time on the verge of tears, distressed at my inability to connect with other people. I have just gotten to a stage where I can`t cope with life at all. Can`t concentrate, can`t relax, can`t do simple chores without majorly stuffing them up, can`t relax socially. In general I can`t get any satisfaction out of life at all.  It came to a head this week when I broke down at work. Through the course of the day I could feel something ugly building and brewing inside of me, it got to the point I could no longer keep it within myself and so I broke down crying. Not a good technique for a salesman to employ. So now I`m on anti-depressants and have a few weeks off work to try and sort myself out.  So that was my piece of drama for the week. Not that this journal is going to be purely biographic, more just a sounding board. Just thought I`d share as a means of letting a little of myself out there.  Cheers       Mick

          I`m trying as best I can to focus on the positive, but what my head tries to focus on is overuled by what my gut instincts tell me.  I was at the doctors the other day, and he`s doing the best he can to try and reassure me that all is going well, all will get better and that things are not all bad. My head was going yes, I have a job to go back to, I have a lovely supportive wife, and professional help. My gut instinct however was telling me thats`s it! The only thing I really have going is my marriage, and if I don`t get my head together soon then I`m going to tear that apart along with everything else in my life.  From my own life experience I almost feel as if I`m being rebuilt so I can be torn down again. I don`t want to, and don`t feel capable of returning to my job. It`s not an environment in which my self-esteem is going to thrive. If I go back, I give it a fornight before I`m a basket case again. I have no true supports other than my wife and my doctor.  It`s been a lifetime of letdowns, frustration, futlity, boredom, dissapointment, shame and uselesness. I have no ideal skills at all. I`m purely floating, helpless as I become ever more unravelled.   All the time I feel sick with nerves. The aches, sleeplessness, anxiety and sheer terror of what is next fester in my guts. I need more out of life than being ignored, bullied, ridiculed, excluded. I need somewhere I belong. I need to feel I am valuable and appreciated, not merely conveniant and tolerated.  I have lost all joy & all hope. Whats next? Fucked if I know.

          Life is pretty fucked up right about here. As I write this I am pissed off my face, to a degree where I`m having a hell of a time fime the keys to this damned computer of mine.  First off the docs visit was a waste of $80. basically he told me that the meds were going to fuck with me big time, and then proceeded to make a lot of lame jokes to try & coax me out of my depression. Fuck me!!! I can expect that from family, friends (the few that I have)but from a doctor? At least he`s given me time off work, and at this rate I`m going to have to hit him up for a lot more time off work.  The facts are: I can`t cope in this world                I am totally fucking pissed of with people in general.                I am fucking pissed off with our society.                I hate being me.                I`m sick to death of the bullying & what it takes to make it in                   the pecking pecking order that is life as we know it.                I despise that talented people are made to feel totally useless                because being sensitive, being polite, being aware of                  others feelings is viewed as a sign of weekness.  This is the way of the world today. It is heartless, horrible, overly competitive, mean spirited,shallow, vain, plain dumb, ugly & vaucous.  Good people too often get cast aside. Why? A little chubby? A little shy? Not fashion concious enough? Supposedly not driven? FFFFUUCCCKKK!!! I am at the end of my life as I know it. If I can`t make a change, stand up for myself, live my life by my terms, then whats the fucking point. Might as well dring myself to ruin, or top myself. Who wants to spend their life being invisible? I mean these BLOGS are an example of how the world is working. I`m sur there are a lot mof desperate toss pots out there who are just looking for diaries of young girls so they can jack off over them. Does anyone really care how real human beings feel these days? I doubt it. Life is really pushing my buttons right now
