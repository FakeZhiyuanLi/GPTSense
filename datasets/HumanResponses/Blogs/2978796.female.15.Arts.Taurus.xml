      hmmm... well now it's already 10:05... well, not too late, but I'm already getting tired... today was a pretty good day, I woke up kind of late - which wasn't too bad, then i got to school, did shool which was pretty good, except laura left, which sucks, I love that girl - seriously - she has so many good qualities, I already miss her! *stupid people*.... hmm, so yea, then i got home, and I went out for dinner with my family - well besides my dad... it was pretty good :) we went to Kelsey's, which was okay, the weirdest guy served us though, and he put us in such an awkward spot, and I was littlerall sitting in like... a bush... haha it was kinda weird, but overall it was pretty good... then I got home and i watched Degrassi, such a good show, I think i have a major crush on Craig, who doesn't? he is so spiffy... *drool* yea... then I wrote like a two page letter to Lex, for fun i guess... lol see, don't I have such a fun night? yea i don't.... haha, it's okay though I guess... maybe tomorrow ngiht will b better, hopefully I will do soemthing more productive, and i won't have homework, it's such a drag. OH ... then i got an e-mail from my beloved Dave, haha, yeah, he's such an awesoem guy, he better not leave!!! hmmm... so now, i still haven't finished off memorizing my drama thing, well wait... I haven't memorized any of it - at all! it's so abd, like, it's just hard to memorize a four page... thing, it really is, i hate it... but i guess I'll have to do it... Hmm, im having one of those days, you know those days... where you flash abck memories? Ugh... yea it's one of those days... in ways it makes me SMILE, and in others... makes me wanna die... I was running through so much stuff that happend in the past year, and how much i missed out on, or how much fun I had... I loved the days, but hated them just as much, just like i hated the people, but loved them just as much, what a life... Hmmm, i love all my friends i have now, i still ahve recent regrets, about things that happend, which, i would die to take back... and things I'm so happy that they ended, that my life is so much - more... *bliss* yea, I'm old fashioned... what can ya do? This is a random note: but don't you wanna just wanna YLL sometimes... just full-out scream, like Craig and Marco did? But like in teh middle of class, just let it go silent....*.... YELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL... get into trouble, and Smile... How much i'd kill to do that. It's such a good feeling. "I hate it, I hate it, I hate, Loving it..." you know what i mean? When you hate something so much that you totally can't stop thinking of how in love you are with it... GOD, i ahte that... haha but I LOVE IT TOO! Sometimes i totally fall in love with what i can't get... and i love that feeling... then it crashes down when you get it... i hate that even more... like when you have something, you can hold onto it SOOOOO TIGHTLY... but or no apparant reason... it's gone... just simply... gone, i hate that... without a reason, without a word to say you are completely shut-out, i hate that feeling... haha - whoa.... now I am on borderline... G'night... peace and love  "And if you shall live, live hard, and if you shall die, die long..."  Love and Loads, Erin

      that song... that is below... I think I have a new obsession with it, I love it to death! I heard it this morning on like 98.1.... it is just so damn addictive... i freaking love it!! Hmmm... i had a good night tonight, I went with Niki and Kate to Joe's soccer game, it was fun, we also hung out with this guy Anthony, he is pretty funny... it was a good ol' time... whoa I feel like a GRAMA! Hmmm... aww I love my nana:) she is so cute, and chubby... that's basically besides any part of anything I am saying...But, hmm... do you ever run through your head on things you hate, or things you want to do or say so badly, but it takes up sooo much confidence to do? Yea, I always do that, or just you want to do something, and go for it... you are so close, and then you just stop and can't do it, like something is litterally there and pulling you back, and you can't in any way go for it?! Whoa... i hate that! hmm, yea I think at times I have waaaaaaaayyy too much time on my hands, but what do you expect? It's so ahrd to just sit still and pay attention to everything going on. Well anyways, I can't wait til this march break... it will be so good, so peaceful, being able to do anything i want, well basically, and just have fun! Get my mind off of school, and sleep!  "now this is my time, and I'm gunna make this moment right... I shouldn't have wasted those days..." MUSIC! hmmm, so good! well... now I am done, nothing really much to say, wish me luck for my skit/monolouge tomorrow... and the geo. test!

      I'm so sorry that I hurt you... but, why do you always do this to me, why? couldn't you just see through me... how come you act like this? Like you just don't care at all.... do you expect me to belive I was the only one to fall...  But then I can feel you - when you're far, i can feel you near.... I need you...    Tell me, are you and me still together, tell me... do you think we can alst forever? why...     Listen to what we're not saying...     Try to look at me, and really see my heart, and do you expect me to let us fall apart? I can feel you, I can feel you baby... but it's not supposed to feel this way, and I need you more each day  ... and I feel so sorry for everything I done, if only you could feel how it feels to be in my position, but guys are so ahrd to trust, but then again, what am I? I can't help it, I hate it when people hate me, or when they don't know the real me, but decide to hate me... or i hate it so much how i need something that is so hateful towards me, when we were so...us. But I hate complaining...and feeling sorry for myself, or feeling sorry for anything, i mean everything is meant to happen, and it happens for a reason... but why? why can't we know ahead of time, or why can't we do what we are supposed to do, or not do what we aren't... I hate that... i hate it even more, that i hate what im saying, and i hate it so much how  hate  is such a strong word, wow, it is used alot, and people let it slip by so easily... but i do always... hmmm but how much i love to hate, but hate to love, or let myself love anything, and everything, or lose love is the hardest, or when you think it's love, or... i don;t know, but do people expect me to be the only one that fell? I fell, well I never really fell, i dont think, I thought i did... but no, just i need you... you...you... tell me, can we - can;t we... I can't even understand myself... maybe I should stop, or maybe can i keep venting, i hate to vent to thw world... or i hate for people to judge me, but can i hate what is meant to happen? maybe people are meant to hate, but I can't hate at all... i can't understand myself... but man i love my friends... i need them, always, i couldn't do anything without them, i need them to be there... it;s a  must  and I love the fact that i love them, and never have enough hate, to hate them.... but i still can feel you near me, i can feel you baby.... and it's not supposed to hurt....not this way, not this way....

Yea so I hung out with my cool mom, and cousin and aunt, lol it was goodm yea they're cool, my mom and aunt together are actually really funny, so it was good, we stayed at the most crappy hotel ever! so bad, lol so odd, but it was fun anyways, i like what I bought, so it's good! And there was  such  a hot guy at the mall, i swear, hottest guy ever, ugh, how i wished he lived here, or maybe he does... he is just so...perfect, he seemed like such a cool guy too! it was cute because he was shopping with his mom, and little sister, yea we had our "look" the eye to eyes, so it was all worth the while, even though I won't ever see him, I named him though... Derek, I named him that, and I don't even know why! Just first name... yea he is a hotty, like double a battery! yesss... michelle and gill and em, and olivia know what I'm talking about! he is a sexy dude.... now why am i talking abut this? Guys are such assholes... no offence, i love 'em and hate 'em...  anyways im off to NICOOLS! welll soon... lol my sister is gone... she is up north "snowboarding"... yea probably like partying, that's my girl! lol yea, i got the coolest shirt, it says..."Im rad, you're rad... let's hug" yea it's so good and explanitory, i love it! hmmm i'm bouncing from different topics, but that's ok... anyways today my mom told me a story on how her friend Amy's daughter had a boyfriend, and he was like totally abusive... it sucks so much, because her daughter Leah and I were the greatest friends when we were younger, she had to repear grade 12, which is really  shitty...   but yea, and now they are broken up thank god, hmmm yea anyways... now I am off to nicool's... i hope it will be fun...

        ...I'm better off alone anyway    Well, today is the last day of march break - which sucks... but then again, kinda cool... ashley is commin... whoo hoo! finally... yesss.... BONUS! well today I watched the ,ovie thirteen, in ways.. it's so unbelievable... like cmon it just wasn't realistic... but in so many other ways, it is... like can you believe so many people go through that, it's just so damn harsh... and I hate when people are like that, and I know they think it's a way to cure them, in ways i cna believe, but I ahte to see people like that, but inw ays i can't blame them... it's their way to get away from... everything. Which is such a good feeling at times... but yea, it's a good movie just well for anyone... like people after seeing it, makes you realize so much, how much you need that time on your own, to put yourself int ehir shoes, and see where you stand in life, where you belong, and what you need in your life, and what you can get out of it... what you need out of your life aswell... I think that the acting was aweosme, it made you ... almost feel what she was feeling, like you were in her position, and how easily something like that could happen so easily, and that people are doing stuff like that around you, alot of people never know what's going on with one of their closest friends, which is hard, and so unbelievable to see your friend going through that stuff, and I know, and I hate it, alot... I mean it hurts, it makes me so sad...  SO  tough... just so... it's so painful to see, and to almost feel the on comming pressure, and how everyone deals with their problems in their own way, it is so real though, people can talk their way out of things, can sing their way out, can cut themselves out... or drink their lives away, and it's all so true, and in ways... they ahve to, they have to do it enoguh and enough just to realize how much it's hurting them more, and how its one more thing on their shoulders that they have to deal with... it's rough... it's so rough. And then again, I know nothing at all what some are going through, i belive that everyone has their own way to get away, and i know that, some people get away by telling people how they feel, which is good, I love helping people out, to make them feel better... but I don't know. It's all so confusing... when people need to hurt themselves in all sorts of ways to help them out. Life cna be a downer... but I belive that you only have yourself to bring you up... i really do, I also belive  everything  happens for a reason... and it does... it really does... believe me, it seriously does... most people wont notice but... look back on things that happen, and sooner or later you will realize why it happend... and it will turn out good... trust me... you'll see    "you're my slaughter... and you've cut more than once... deeper each time"

      hmmm... Today was a pretty good day, i hung out with Gill and Emily, we walked around, we saw Ivan - he got a haircut, it was pretty cool  then we came back here... my mom and I had a fight, then fell in love with Gill and Emily, to make me "not mad"... my sister was going on a date with another one of her "various" boyfriends... named like Michael or something, yea it was Michael, he had a crew cut, and I want her back with Gero... and i think deep down she does too  We walked around, and saw Jordan... but they had to meet Jason, but they didn't he has the  COOLEST  hair ever... it's like a bush, lol... whoa but cool... and then we went out later on, for a walk, we made UPSEENLY loud noises which caused a lady to run outside of her house to see if we "okay" lol... whoa it was kinda horrible...  then emily and I watched How to deal... one of my favorite movies... it was good... we noticed so many random "not needing to be there" things...  after that we ate...quite a bit, we were hungry, an talked to cool darryl... yea he's cool... it was good, but we kept laughing, we couldn't stop, it was bad, but oh so good  Now I am here, doing nothing, and I suppose i am bored... I am home alone too... which makes it "extra fun"... hmm, it's 11:00 now... but I'm not tired....  I dont know what there is to do... but Emily had I relaized this... get a load....  -you cry when someone is born - but cry when someone dies -you cry when you get hurt - and cry when you are cured -you cry when you get married - and cry when you get divorced -you cry when you are happy - you cry when you are sad  you cry for everything... or at least when you aren't crying, you want to... but you know what I mean... and we found such... powerful lyrics...   Do You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize - we're floating in space - Do You Realize - that happiness makes you cry Do You Realize - that everyone you know someday will die  And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round  Do You Realize - Oh - Oh - Oh Do You Realize - that everyone you know Someday will die -  And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round  Do You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize   and it's funny because most people don't realize this... but sooner or later you will have to acknowledge what is there, and what's to come, because nothing and ever stay perfect... it's like when the going gets tough to just keep going... it works... try it  "everyone knows, but they won't tell, but their half-hearted smiles tell me something just ain't right..."

      Ohhh what a night last night was... It was pretty freaking awesome... well we didn't get to the concert til about like... 8:30... but that was okay, we hung out with Kimesha for a bit, and tonya etc... then we went in, wasn't too full, so we went and got a POPSICLE... mm me and Lyd ate it, {it was good} then we went outside for a while and hung out with people... we saw SEAN-O!!! Although it was pretty embarassing considering the day before when we saw him we kept yelling random things at him... oops ...So we ACTUALLY met the guys from  Courtesy BLUSH ...we did meet, the lead singer and the drummer, outside of PIZZA PIZZA... where they did their little 'commercial" intro for us...they were pretty cool... but we did have a very large incident in pizza pizza with "SUMIRA... or shall I say SUMARA" she was so mean, she never gave Lyd and I our fries... so we all totally SPAZZED! it was horrible... we were sooo mad! oh goodness, but we laughed sooo hard, lol and we learnt a new word... *skunt* yea, ask Lydia, she said it very loud, but so randomly... so we had an awesome night, we met "Hugh" *hef* for short... which was kinda cool... well then the Kimesha thing, well Gill and I helped her through most of the night, she was feeling realllyyy sick... and she puked everywhere... oh man, I hope she is okay... but yea, she threw water  all over me... I was pretty soaked... but oh well.... she said sorry, but then again it totally wasn't her fault. We also met Marc's new girlfriend, she seems cool, but very quiet... but that was pretty cool... oh tehn we re-united with simon, he was so cool! and very nice... But now I have found a new love for "Dear Jane I" they are really good, they have such awesome lyrics, so it's really good! Really good... but I was very tired most of the night, for some... odd... reason, i dont really know why, but oh man, it was a good night, maybe a tad dirty, but very good, and *original* I slept really good though... never woke up once... I had an awesome sleep! but hmmm today i don't know what i am going to do... i'll have to see... Oh man, nothing planned... yet, hopefully something will be planned, soon enough, so anyways that was my "can-be-lame-can-be-interesting" story... enjoy  Peace and love,  Erin  "My name is Auriana... i don't do drugs..." yea that's all i know... haha you get it

       Ahhh...   Tonight was a fun night - good day also... we had a good assembly... this girl Sarah Lott, she has an  amazing  singing voice... how I wish I could sing, but with this HORRIBLE voice that I have... it's harsh, oh well...  Tonight Olivia, Lydia and Emily came over... it was fun, we had a good time, we met Daniel... well we knew him - but re-met, and talked to JAMES! yea, we even threw rocks at his window... no reply, oh because he was  "sleeping in his living room!"  ahh... grrr... Oh well, he got his lisence... SWEET! Yea, he'll be haulin' us around in the great van... he better! Golf balls in return... haha ya betchya!  So, olivia did the FUNNIEST voice EVER when she orderd the pizza... she is so hillarious! I could cry.... whoa, she's cool...! and same with em and lid... they had a slapping fight... and they fell in love with boys behind the camera... Brandon... Lid's love, and "Lumber Jack" i don't know his name... but yea lumber jack... it was SO lame... but SO funny, we made a whole senerio for it... which was so  retarted !  My parents were  crazy  tonight... my mom and her silk robe, and her obsession for ticketmaster, and my dad and his tea, and for my cat... and his new saying ..."simple chillin'"  oh how I have an ODD family...  So - Shauna has a new "boyfriend" ish guy, anmed Rob - he seems cool, from what she tells me, she went on her second date with him tonight - with emina and laura etc... more of a group date, so I'm happy for her! THATS MY GIRL! haha... then FINALLY the "hot guy from school" called my other sister tara, and they are going out tomorrow night, which i find so good! because I am so sure she is happy!   Hmm ... then there is me! yea... well, I have my friends, and thank god for 'em! couldn't live without 'em, haha, yea they rock much!  But...  yea, hmmm, it sucks how when you "feel" (i suppose you could say) for someone... and you have absolutly NO idea where they are or what state of mind they are in... and you think they are SO cool, and SO just... ugh, COOL! Just so, nice and cool to talk to... not like they will probably ever have any interest for you, but I mean ya can try so so hard, and it goes nowhere... Oh well... I mean, I suppose everything happens for a reason...but, who knows... I mean, I would SO love to tell a person how I felt, but I always back so far away from it... so it will just leave, it's so stressfull...   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!   Why? ahh, why? I mean, I am a confident enough person, but noway could I say anything, it's so hard, I mean, in ways, see he could totally be like... righhht on, or be like, uhmm, yea... you're alright, hmmm... or I mean he could be like yea maybe it could work, or your cool - but I am so not risk taking, it's too there... if that helps anything...  So, simply, I am not going to say anything... NOPE! Although he is sooo cool, and just, ya... hopefully he knows that... Ah, well, I won't say anything more  So, the leafs lost... 4-2... well, better luck next time, maybe I will actually watch it... that would be pretty good... hence I don't mind hockey, it's an okay sport...  what else... tomorrow is good friday, that's kinda cool - or hey wait, it already it 12:11... so HAPPY GOOD FRIDAY!...  yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ... nice one huh? Easter soon! PARTY! this year is going by so quick, I still remember new years! and all the good times... gotta let 'em roll!  Well, that's all... thanks for your time... Love always, Erin  "I dare you to tell me what you feel, what you feel for me... hit on hard, slap on slow...this is something, real i oughta know"

      heart strings...  Well... today was a pretty good day, I spent most of it w/ Nicole, Daniela, and Nat. And somewhat Andrew and WIZZIM... haha, yea, I guess they are okay guys... they seem pretty cool... well I bought a cool shirt, that says "im with him" and has an arrow pointing, and I also bought two rings... we had a pretty good time  After i went to nicool's... Joe and I played PS2... FOOTBALL! W/ these butch guys, it was good, except he ruined me, which was a bummer... but oh well, Joe sucks! lol... just kidding, well yea, it was good - then i came home and watched T.V.  Random though - Hulk Hogan rocks...  Hmmm, then i started to watch Boy Meets World... I used to have a crush on Eric, haha... the perfect guy, he is totally crazy, loud, funny, and has nice hair! like... how good can it get? Well, that's besides the point, the whole show was basically all about how Depenga's parents were getting a divorce... it was sad, considering I cried... well not, like... "waterfall"... but yea, I did a bit, watery eyes, and a few came down... just it occured to me, so much - [although it's a t.v. show] just how much one person can coem into your life so fast, and leave without a trace... then there are those people who come in and out, and in and out, but then, there are the ones, the ones you will never forget, the ones, you  think  will be there forever, because they made the biggest impact on your life, and boom their gone, just like that.   Life is a whole different ball game when it comes to "love" ... what is love? Love is what I have for my family and friends, but then when you find that "perfect" somebody they are just supposed to change your like, and BANG it's all over and done with. Yea, but then all the good times, and all the sad times, the happy/sad times, you know - you just want to GO AWAY, but god forbid they come back in your life, everything changes... sometimes... you just have to deal.   Do you ever think... just someday soon, life will just be so ... totally perfect, and everyone around you will be happy, everything will appear to be happy, everyone could smile, and you could fall in love, without all the... pain, and discomfort, or any of the lies. That would be pretty amazing... but it won't happen, and until then, i will keep a smile on my face, and pretend like everything is... " A Okay"  "tongue tied, with string, that ties my heart, from me to you... things aren't the way they used to be... O BUT HEY I FUCKING LOVE YOU!"

      I want to touch the earth...  I baked a cake tonight, for Danielle.. ow ow... it is her 15th birthday tomorrow... yay! i am excited for her, it will be cool! I hope she likes it, I really wanted to decorate her locker... but the thing is, I don't know her locker number, so it sucks... but I wrote her a long note, and baked her a big cake... mmm!  And well... for the rest of it...  "I want to be the only one, for miles, and miles, except for maybe you, and your simple smile... oh it sounds good to me... yes it sounds so good to me, take me away..."  do you ever wonder why you can't just do something?! Like why can't you do the most shamless thing? Like sit on a desk, when the teacher is talking, it isn't harming anyone, or you can't put your fucking elbows on the table, because it's not "polite" (who made that one up) and just everything, the lamest things, why can't you just do, or NOT do them... like the smallest things that won't affect a person in any shape or form, but even still, you can't do it - makes noooo sense... get a grip  Oh - then, I always wonder WHY oh for heaven sakes why people "just want to know" NO AFFECT AGAIN! Like soemthing that happend between you and a friend, from like a week ago, a person brings up, or "asks" about, when they know the exact story, but try to start soemthing more, more commotion, it makes no sense. It has nothing to do with them WHAT-SO-EVER! It really doesn't... ugh, it makes me so mad! And then, when you ask, hey - why'd you wanna know, they say... hmm, just because, fuck use it against me... SO WHAT?! or orrrr when people are like, k, tell me, i wont say a word, so ya trust 'em... and then they go off... and tell someone, and you KNOW it was them that told... but they still like to deny it, and when they were the ONLY person you told, and it's like C'MON! Honestly... that just isn't cool, it's so ... ignorant, and so... risky, like I KNOW IT WAS YOU (not referring to anyone... but, ya catch my drift) it's so, like... retarted, and so shamfull  you're putting it ALL on yourself, you put yourself there, but you still decide to take on other chances, that MAYBE, just MAYBE I will believe it wasn't you, and everything will be okay... it may turn out to be ok, but I will always remember it! I will, really, I will always remember that you said that, and it will run through my mind... what you say will run through my veins...  so... I love the movie edward scissorhands... Mike reminded me to give it to him tomorrow, and then I just had the urge to watch it again, god I love that movie... the best! everything about it, is so... gooood! Props to Tim Burton... haha, really, one day I will work with him... or meet him at least, that's my goal, it's so awesome what he can do/think of... it's so... ahhh cool!  " you can still catch me dancing in the snow..."  Now, i am bleeding... lol... damn burns... well peace out hoes! haha... oh no, i love thee  -Love always... Erin  "... if you're the best of friends, that is who you'll be, stay close, stay near... they won't disapear"

        dancing in the snow    Well, today was ok... it was pretty good, but I was extremely tired, I was hyper though aswell, Yesterday was like the coolest day! It was danielle's birthday, so i baked the cake, and we all ate it! it was fun, we went outside and hung out at lunch too, and Lindsay fell down the staires! ahh! haha, aw she is so cool! and she cut her HAIR!...  "BOWL CUT"    So, alst night, I hung w/ Lydia, we went tanning, to get rid of our glistening skin... and i totally got BURNT, holy tomato! So, what else... we went to her house, then there was a major crisis, with "Jeff" Lydia's boyfriend... well not anymore, things w/ him and her are fine, they are friends now... so it;s great, she FINALLY talked to Brandon... her like "hero" haha, he is cool, I hardly know him - but hey! Then hmm, we hung out w/ James, and his board for about an hour, then Jason and matthew came, then we went back and ate... talked to Jason, and went outside with him... Jason and Al also came, it was pretty fun... and TOOOOONYAAA! still has a little crush on Al... so it's cute, I had to keep up the conversation because Jason has no facial expression, Al and Tonya are like... iffy, and then there is James, on his freaking SCOOTER! Well, it was pretty good, then i raaaaaaaaaaaaaaan home!  So, it was funny/lame... and just overall good, So... what else, today, we finished up the movie in computers, called  wargames  it was good... BUT Harris, and I never sat with eachother, it was tragic.  So, now... my mom is on the phone with someone, talking about my sisters and I, and how we live our lives, or what we do... and how it's so hard for her... now I feel horrible, and she said that I haven't gone through what any of my sisters have yet, and my moms like "well that's gunna be one hell of a ride" wow thanks... god when i hit like... 16, I am going to be GOOD! it will change her opinion.... hopefully  So, laura is comming voer tonight, Shauna's best friend... I wish she still came to our school, she was really cool, and I MISS HER! At least I get to see her enough, she is so cool, and has such good opinions on things... and she is totally funny... oh the good times... haha, i love that girl!  well, the end!  Love always,  Erin!  "I dare you to move..."

       is there anything worth lieing for?...   and... go leafs go! yaaaa... they won! ow ow... that's awesome, so last night, Lydia and I got dashboard tickets, it's on my birthday so I am  pretttty  excited, I mean I used to not like D.C. but they are good, they have awesome lyrics, so it should be fun. I know Brandon is going, so Lydia is like so excited about that, so I will probably be ditched... ah! Well anyways...  Last night Olivia and I went filming, we mostly filmed "Donald" haha - o joy, olivias *plush dog* it was alot of fun though, she is the  coolest . Then we saw Christina, Peter and "Blood Man" SO ghetto... it was so funny, but they were nice... they taught us some ghetto sayings... then we saw Gill and BOBBY ... shitter, they are going out now... like thanks for not tellling me GILL! although it was only the night before, she should have called me! Damn her... haha well yea, he's pretty cool, and his band is AWESOME... or so I've heard, he is the  drummer  which is pretty cool. We hung out w/ them then found Ismenia, Lydia and Emily...  Then after we went to Lydia's for a bit, and ate, as per usual, and watched the leaf game for a bit, Lydia and I went crazy! Like losers, then Liv and I raaaaaaaan home, and watched it. Then after... I worked a bit on my " at home thingy " which ifs for typing, and which is lame... then I talked about  AIDS  w/ Ben... and went to bed  Yesterday, I also had to go to the hospital, to get the results, I got to leave school early! So, my mom and I went down, my results weren't so hot, but if I just continue w/ the needles, and the medicine, things should be fine. It was supposed to gradually drop, from 100, to 90, to 80... and so on, mine went from 100 to 80, to 56...  not so cool ... but, besides that my mom sister and I went shopping, I bought hot pink shoes, and earrings, rings, and clips... yea they are cool... at least IIII think...  So, what else? Well, today i have the day off... well kinda, and I just have to type up the rest, so then I will probably go film, as per usual, and sit there. Maybe watch t.v. think... nothing?   "the streets were wet, and the gate was locked."

       ...and pushing you far away, because I'm scared.... but I'll take my chances, and head on my way up there...   I am in a very dashboard mood... very very... and I don't know why, their lyrics are so good...   I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  [1.] I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever."  [2.] Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I was anywhere with anyone Making out.  I'm missing your laugh How did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.  [1.] I am alone In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home  I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and This bottle of beast is taking me home.  [2.]  Your hair, it's everywhere. Screaming infidelities And taking its wear. [Repeat Four times]   That's screaming infidelities... it's so good... there are many more, so, i guess I am pretty excited to go to the concert, it should be fun!   Now, it's Friday, and I have no idea what I am doing this weekend... maybe something fun, hopefully, i know that Lydia is comming over tonight, and I have NOOO idea what else we are doing, but we'll have to see, hmmm...  I am SO bored... ahh it's only 4 too... hmmm, well oh well, I will go back to listening to D.C.  Later Love, Erin!   "she had a history of killing herself, i had a habit of dying..."

        black black heart...    hmm... this weekend so far has been fine, pretty swanky actually... hung w/ Lydia, Emily, Eric, Marc, Martin, Ton, Meg, Michelle, Jason and Jordan yesterday... just did some pretty random things... Gill went over to Bobby's.... to "watch movies" he seems nice, he has a pretty awesome band [www.typoska.tk] but hey, they are together now, so it's awesome on her be half... so Marc and I "made up" I guess if it was anything of a fight... but he was being a jerk off... but it's ok. I like his hair. Lydia's smells like Florida. mmm. hmmm... Will was being a jerk also... but Lyd set him straight... we also video taped, and took pictures... goin' pro w/ that... it's so sweet, we took the coolest pics, which are so pointless, but so funny... I also painted my nails tonight... black, for the fuck of it... I had nothing else to so... because Emily ditched me... meh, she rocks.... also, tonight Jonathan, Robyn's brother, was sooooooooooooooooooooo funny, he was doing the most hilarious parts from movies....  Like gollum, it was like perfect, and from the hot chick, from dickie roberts, and half baked... "your front two teeth were brown" ahhh... *sick, sick, sick*.... it was good, then Simon came over, to bring them alcohol, but well Terry and Randy and PAMMMMMM came home a bit early, but we walked home... so it was ok, meh... O and Will's Grandma is still in that absement, I was freaked to shit....  I could here her  I can't wait til May 15th besides my birthday the dashboard concert, and I don't know why, but I want to go so badly, it's going to be so sweet, ah, I'm sooo excited, it's lame. But, I also can't wait for the summer... it's gunna be sweet, really, it will be. I may work at Michael's art place... so it should be good, I hope at least, I plan for Lydia to work with me... she better, or Em, it would rock... we get to bring home JEWELS... JEWELS? YAAAAAAA JEWELS!  So hmmm... what else? My mom bought me a shirt, it says Fuck... I can't wear it to school, my mom likes swearing... Aislin and I masterd the "Straight Up" in gym... yea... straight up...  My back hurts... i complain too much...  Si-Bitch... forever... yea, Si-bitch  and also... I think I have like an odd attachemnt for Edward Scissorhands... which is odd... but true, and I am obsessed w/ it, because it is THE best movie ever... yupp, best ever... watch it, now  I also have an obsession for dashboard, because I kept singing it yesterday and today, and Marc and I sung into the camera, like lame hobos... but he loves it, I also would have sung to ally, to cheer her up...   I am going on with the most random non-needed things...   Peace and Love...  "you said... you said... we'd be bestest friends forever..." JON!

Friday Mallort, Megan, Lydia and I went to see Mean girls, which is such a good movie, and so true, because every girl in the world is so,  MEAN  at some point in their life, but we had fun, it was funny. Also...  Then Lydia slept over, which was good, we took the most retarted pictures, of my ugly tie die peace shirt, and her crazy sunglasses, it was good. Then...  Saturday Olivia, and Jiz and I met up with paige and mir... which was TOTALLY insane, but so  good  we took the subway to fairview, and met up with sacha, *i havent seen him since camp* so we went to see the movie Envy, which sucked, so much, and we all were being so loud, and screaming random things to the ghetto kids, and we left, we bought a camera and took the CRAZIEST pictures, we then left, and took the subway and street car to paige's and took retarted pictures on the subway, where i got kicked in the head, where i cried, and laughed my fucking ass off, majorly. We also hung from the bars. we got to paige's and ate, as per usual, and just hung and listend to music, then we walked to DOMINIONS! grocery store,  *best place...food*  and we bought cake, cool whip, cinnabons, etc... and we walked home,and picked up a "6" yes, a six, sadly no "9"s were left for BIRTHDAY GIRL OLIVIA THE GREAT! We got back to paige's and went totally crazy, we drank and made a friend FRAISER, we peed outside, especially paige and her PISSING ramPAIGES... we  "peed"  off her roof, and listened to LOUD music, and did some fucking crazy dancing, to the best music...  CARRRROLIIIIINE  mm huh, we orderd pizza, and paige mooned the pizza man, and sacha took a picture of the HOT pizza man. ow ow, sexy. it was about 12 when Sacha had to leave, so we walked him to the street car and RAAAAAN after it, and waved good-bye! Then we all went back, and went inside, then went out, then it POURED rain and Mir and I raaaan out in the rain, partially naked, and it was fun, wet fun! *mmm*  Okay, so we ended all going bakc inside, and chilling, listening to music, and being ourselves totally wild, and odd, just us. When it was pouring rain, thundering, lightening, and we were home alone, just us 5. when  KJHSUIFYYGUWHBAAAAAAAMIUYFUYTSG  the thunder hit hard, although that never occured to us, we thought it was someone comming inside to murder us, we BOLTED into paiges closet, we were TERRIFIED, Jiz, Mir and I wouldnt get out of the closet, we sat int here, with a knife, while Olivia and miss fuckin 69er PAIGE, got long curtain sticks and the pilon we stole, and checked everywehre in the house, and so we knew that if soemthing bad happend they'd yelll SIXTY NINE! and we'd save them... they checked, and everything was ok, but we got her bee bee gun, a butcher knife, the swiss army knife, and our girl power to fight them off... yea, we were pro...  that night we talked about everything. life. it was good, good to have good friends.   the next morning we woke up, and ate, as per usual... and walked down queen, mir and i went CRAZY and bought the coolest things we bought *i love my penis gum* and AWESOME lighters and matches, we also bought the craziest beads, that are going to see grool earrings, and I bought a top, then Mir left, on teh street car, and we followed it, as we did sacha, we then went into mac, and olivia did paige's make up SOOOOO ugly, and so THERE it was the shit, she was on FIYA! buuuuuuut she knows she loved it. We went into the condom shack to buy olivia her dildo, but that didn't happen, sadly...  SHE WANTED THAT DILDO!  Paige left, Olivia and I never got our sushi, that we NEEDED, we got home, and I cut olivia's hair, she loves it, so it's so good!!! I loved it too, I am her peronal hair dresser... cool huh? or grool? whateer one, but... all in all, good times, with good people...

I fucking love you. okay, not love, like, extra much, and horrible... you don't know, horrid i can't tell, and let down. i am so afraid to take risks, i am only afraid of being shut down, by you. oh god, by you. not secure. it's like, i try to get you to notice, do you? do you realize... or shall i shun myself, from you... but really, i'd like to see you undone.  do you ever want so much, that you know you can't get, or get so much you don't want?  like people who die, do they want to die, that very second they pull the trigger? or people who fall in love, do they  want  to fall?... I don't want to... i don't want to feel, that would be ... bliss.   oh, not to feel.  NOT TO FEEL  i love the way it sounds... I CANT FEEL... I want that, if I could wish for anything, it would be exactly that. I wouldn't be able to feel a beating, i wouldn't feel my heart beat. i wouldn't feel you slash me like a razor blade. I wouldn't miss you, or the person you  used  to be, and i wouldn't hate you.  I wouldn't have fallen in love with  you ... and i wouldn't be falling for  you   I D O N T W A N T T O F E E L...  but most of all, i don't want you to feel me, in the end i will hurt you, scar you... or make you laugh.   I don't want your zealous kiss to steal my heart. pain.  i don't want to cry myself to sleep because you didn't love me today, because you struck my aching heart, because i am only 15.  and i dont care if it hurts, i sincerely want to be perfect, i want a perfect body, i want a perfect soul... crushed. can you lift me? why is there feel... why is there touch, before you came along i was fine. simply.   fine.     "Excuse me while I fall apart, don’t flatter yourself sweetheart, let me take the wheel, and I’ll crash this car"

      reach out from the inside.  http://www.goolis-art.com/images/pain.jpg  go there...   way to express...  I went to olivia's tonight, it was good, we hung out, and i painted my nails, purple, hip hip, good times, i can so be me around her, not like anyone else... so i always feel so free when i am around her, i am nothing but me.  uhm, I  hate  you, but I'm sure you don't care... considering.  I don't know if i have laready said this, but Chris sent flowers to me to my house on my birthday, they are sooo beautiful, and i have them in my roon, with the card and everything, he is the coolest guy, too bad his arm is broken. fuck you arm breaker assistor, i hate you so bad.  so bad, it works.  I hate how they say "work hard for something you really want" but if you want soemthing, and soemthing "wants" you back, what the fuck is so hard?  I want to be that complete  Shauna drove ash and i to school, fun. haha, it was though, i have lame fun with shauna, she is the ultimate, can be mean, but deep down, she is so cool... we can relate, just not on music. boo, to that  anyways,   "love, i get so lost sometimes... days pass - and this emptiness fills my heart, when i want to run away,  i drive off in my car... but which ever way i go, i come back to the place that you all are. but i hope i will run from everything, because you make me believe in what i hate, with all the noise, without my pride, i reach out from the inside"

       just don't fall in love with me...   if we're goin' nowhere. than stay where we are.  to never fall in love again.  the long weekend, this weekend... hm... I am tired, what will i do?   whatever, live for the irony.  everyone is still in chicago, and grade 11's went to see troy, the school felt deserted, like i was back in 8th grade, with hardly any kids... i hated the feeling. reminded me of all the bad times, and i don't want to get into that, it isn't worth it. i ran today in gym, actually ran, not for anyone else, but me. i want a perfect body, but to purify my soul. not that  you  care. what a breath taking run, and litterally, breath taking.    forget the sorrow. watch it pass the day as it fades away. today. but we say.   I can't wait til I am out of school, overall, i am going to move out of her, far away, somewhere warm, but rains, i will fufill all of my dreams, and be who  I  want to be. When Bevi and i go to California, we will stay there, and live there, in our car. We will. We will sing, and bitch about life, but live it together, and bring our lovers with us. Oh, we will sing.   here we coooome.  you know how you  say  things that will happen, and you plan all this stuff with all your friends, and ar elike, yea this, yea that, this will happen, blah blah blah - never does. but then out of the blue, out of nowhere, you do it. you say i am doing this, here and now, there is no better time. I am going to start living out my life like that.   no regrets, no pain. just life, and how  I  want my life to be, I have to stop pleasing  you , but myself.  so, don't make me regret what i have done, or what i am about to do, because i will do it anyways... and you won't have any influence on my decision.  my life.  my life.  "... if i wasn't than why would i say i am." thank you lydia/danielle.!

       your never there, but you're everywhere. you're everywhere.   "every single time i see you, i start to feel this way, it makes me wonder if im ever gonna feel this way again, there's a picture hanging in the back of my head, see it over, and over, i want to hold you, love you, in my arms and then... i want to need you, because need to be with you til the end, then i hear myself reply, you gotta hold it in, this time, tonight..."  define perfect beauty.  inside - brains, a huge heart, have love, care for others, be kind, helping, smart, cure, happy, bright, friendly, funny, over beautiful.   outside - huge boobs, beautiful face, perfectly straight and white teeth, a gorgeous smile, curvy hips, a nice ass, loooong legs, flat stomach, tall, long blonde hair, or generally a  beautiful  color, tanned.  perfect? no.  what is perfect, the word is almost as strong as  love . it really is.  NOTHING  is perfect, nothing. Nothing is close to perfect, so WHY define it? Why isn't perfect hate? I PERFECTLY HATE YOU. I PERFECTLY WANT TO LOVE YOU. perfect what? perfect nothing.  .........................................................................................  ^ that is my borderline.  -i realized how you made me feel. -i tried to wash the pain away from me. -you're everywhere to me. -no matter where i go, i feel you so. -when i close my eyes, it's you i see. -when i catch my breath - it's you i breathe. -i'm not alone. -you make me believe.  do you see me?  - so this friday, aedan's comming - hip hip - we are planning on taking some "fucktabulous" photos of non other but ourselves, although i HATE pictures of me, it's aedan, THEE shit. haha, worth it? THEN I am going to the schomberg [sp?] fair with people, maybe that will be fun - hopefully! ya... hmm, ALSO danielle, I LOVE HER, is playing the piano and singing at the concert tomorrow night - i will cry - she is my FAVORITE singer, i am her BIGGEST fan. She is so awesome, she totally deserves to be up there, and i can't wait. i will be with her the WHOLE night - by her side, SOUND CHECK... hip. all the way, it's worth it, 100%!  Sciecne was awesome today - i hate it, but jordan and i got to clean the tubes agian - considering it  IS  our business, everyone loves it, and then the accident, brent, he loved it. oh that's embarrasing, oh well. "it's all over my goggles"  the end.!  "great and sucks - it's the same thing"

       freak out.    WOOONDERLAND!   was fun :)  Oh yus, we all went for our grade 9 geography classes, which was pretty awesome, and it was fun! At first we had to watch the "slideshow" which was so boring, but then we got to watch this "presentation" where I got to go up infront of everyone with becky, and rachel, and james faber... it was cool except for the "odd" guy with the whole [coconuts, cellphone, rubbing my back, "how you doin'" thing] and then we were FREE... it was so cool, Bronwyn, Niki, Ais, Kristen, Linds, Becky, Rach, Laura, Jenny, and I went together, on about 7 rides, and we basically lost our voice - it was sweeeeeeet. yus, sweeeeeeet. Then kristen, laura, Bronwyn and I got tattoos, Bron and Kris got these sun things on their lower backs, Laura got two hearts on her neck, and I got an outline of a star on my wrist. Then we were  SO  hungry, so we got HUGE fries, and mine had an incedent when they were going to fall... fall... fall... then consisted of me putting my hand IN the fries... where I got ketchup on my hand... and from there welaughed, i got embrarrased, and the man said "it happens to all of us", NO IT DOESN'T. Then I sat with Bronwyn on the way home... so overall it was fun loudness!  Hm... tomorrow wonderland AGAIN! hip hip, and jooooooooel is going to ask aislin out, which is pretty cool! I am so happy for them - they are awesome for eachother, and then mike and I are going, and Kristen and Erik... what a funny kid - shall be good times. I will not go bunjy jumping, never! But it will be fuuun!  also... " you are stupid. and I know you read this. and you are stupid for your actions. think of other peoples feelings. people hurt. realize it. stop satisfying yourself."  "na na... na na na na na... I miss you, I miss you so bad, I don't forget you, Oh it's so sad, I hope you can hear me, I remember it clearly, the day you slipped away, was the day I found it won't be the same, oooh... na na.... nanananana, I didn't get around to kiss you, goodbye on the hand, I wish that I could see you again, I know that I can't, oooh... I hope you can hear me, cause I remember it clearly... the day you slipped away." -for nicole, about grampa... *tear* real tear...  I hope you never slip away.  love always, erin.    "sing about you and i - and the day we met. the day you made me live again. now."

Boo you harry... why are you so negatory to me now? Lacking the niceness ... i cry... BROKEN INSIDE.   You're a wannabe and that's all you'll ever be stop looking forward concentrate on your past you were the last last left behind.   "I also want to add it was I who let the dogs out"   I've come to the conclusion, I hate you most. You are the least of my worries But still I fear of facing you, eye to eye and keeping in all the pain. When all I want to do, is scream.  -Erin Leydon    The greatest thing you'll ever know, is to love and be loved in return."

I wish she had still came. She is probably one of the most inspiring people I've ever met, besides a few, she doesn't even mean to be, which is so awesome. Just they way she is, she is so awesome. I love talking to her, she is so just cool. She is here for the block assembly which is tomorrow, which should be good, and long. hip hip. thank god.

        I’ve kissed a guy... I’ve kissed guys. I just haven’t felt that thing.... That thing... that moment when you kiss someone and everything around you becomes hazy, and the only thing in focus is you and this person. And you realize that that person is the only person you’re supposed to kiss for the rest of your life. And for one moment you get this amazing gift. And you wanna laugh and you wanna cry, ‘cause you feel so lucky that you’ve found it, and so scared that it’ll go away all at the same time." -Never been kissed, Drew Barrymore
