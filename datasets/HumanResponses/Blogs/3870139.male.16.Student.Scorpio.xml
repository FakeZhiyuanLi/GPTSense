      ... then i just found out that little tears are forming on the corner of my eye. Can't believe it, been crying for a movie. Well, hard for me to resist but honestly, i'm just carried away. Bet you take it as corney and a cliche-type, but for me, it is worth piercing to the hardest entity of our human emotion. I myself who is proven to be numb(numbing me?!) got carried in every scenes especially the last excerpts of the movie. I find it inspiring to live the life to the fullest as what am I doing now. It gave stresses my point of "Life no matter how short or long is still life, love is the element that prolongs and shortens our finite life".

      Hey I'm with my classmates here(Bootc@mp). Purpose? Wasting time!!! Hehehe, honestly, wasting time. You know, am waiting for my girlfriend. I'm waiting till 7:00 and it's still ten mins. before five. Well, gotta wait for love's sake. It's just a simple sacrifice since I have nothing to do in the house. And it's my pleasure to post here so nothing to bother right? But most of all, I want to thank my two companions, Kate and Nollie. Thanks my friends!!!

      God dammit ?*#@@@! Who the heck he think he is. Yeah, another bad day from one son of bitch. We've been in a bullshit computer shop with one son of a bitch for an owner. What does he think he is, he can put his filthy hands over my face. He even doesn't have the right to speaj on me like that. Well, don't want to talk about it anymore. It's just another bad day that will be left behind tomorrow. It's getting the shit out of my ass.

      I'm tired of being  what you want you want  me to be Feeling so faithless Lost under the surface I don't know what you're expecting of me Caught under the surface of walking in your shoes Every step that I take is another mistake to you  I've become so numb I can't feel you there Become so tired so much more aware I'm becoming this all I want to do Is be more like me And be less like you  Can't you see that you're smothering me holding too tightly Afraid to lose control Cause everything that you thought I would be has fallen apart right in front of you Every step that I take is another mistake to you And every second I waste is more than I can take  And i know I may end up failing too But I know you were just like me with someone diasappointed in you

      Been seeing me quite so happy. Nah, you saw it wrongly. Been seeing me that sad, well you might be right this time. I've been doing this for a decade. Showing up masks to hide my weaknesses. Hard to show up what is the real me. Frighted to let others know who am i for real. Don't take it as badly as you feel now. I'm not fooling you that way. I'm just being precautious of showing up my personality to everyone. Reasons? Yeah... I really mean things for the reason. Hard for me to say but need to give a clincher as a must. Well, it is my experience who gave me the cause for this practice. That way you might understand me. Hope so, well don't take this seriously, it's part of my collection of mask. Got you again.

      I was here, somewhere, nowhere you can find. Indeed, I don't know where am I too. Just been here for nothing. Nothing? No, been here for one thing. Well, it's my favorite chore to do. Yes, you read it right, my chore. It's my way of releasing myself, sort of an outlet where I can reach out for my personality. I'm sorta wander from street to street or alley which I find to be my refuge of being alone. Alone and away from society, outcast maybe. Well, I've been enjoying this for an hour so cause after this, I'm back with my social life. Another part of me, another part of numbing joseph. The dark side or lighter. Don't know...
