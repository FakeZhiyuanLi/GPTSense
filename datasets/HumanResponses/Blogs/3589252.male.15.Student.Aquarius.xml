        &nbsp;            Review  They can break any code and get inside any system. They are often still in their teens and already under surveillance by the authorities. They are the hackers. Zero Cool, real name Dade Murphy, is a legend among his peers. In 1988 he single-handedly crashed 1,507 computers on Wall Street and was forbidden by law to touch another keyboard until his 18th birthday. It’s been seven years without a byte, and he’s hungry. Kate Libby, handle Acid Burns, has a souped up laptop that can do 0 to 60 on the infobahn in a nanosecond. When the two collide, the battle of the sexes goes into hard drive.    But all bets are off when master hacker The Plague frames Dade, Kate and their friends in a diabolical industrial conspiracy. Now they are the only ones who can prevent a catastrophe, unlike any the world has ever seen.

       Date: 8 September 2000 Summary: This movie is great, just don't expect a 'Matrix' type budget!  Hackers is by far a fantasy movie. Where else could you find cool teenage kids totally engulfed in computer hacking? This movie in completely full of ridicules computer screen shots and creates a mockery of computer hackers. Even with all this said, I liked this movie very much, and still believe that it's great acting, and well-written story should be considered when viewing this movie.  Hackers begins by showing us the early life of Dade Murphy or `Crash Override' to his hacker buddies. When he was 9 years old, Dade crashed computers all over the world. He was caught, and his sentence was, among other things, the inability to own a computer, or a use a phone for `hacking' purposes until the day of his 17th birthday.   Fast-forward to his birthday, and he and his mother have since moved, and Dade now knows no one, and cleverly introduces himself to Kate Libby known to her friends as `Acid Burn'.  Hackers is a movie about a group of friends who are framed for setting up an oil tanker to spill over into the ocean, which is owned by a company that employs Eugene Belford or `The Plague' played by Fisher Stevens. Eugene has framed the group of hackers to throw off the powers that be to his illegal embezzling of his company's money.  The story is well written, and the choice of actors was well thought out. Newcomer Jonny Lee Miller (Dade Murphy) is perfect as the `leader' of the group. The always beautiful and newly recognized Angelina Jolie (Kate Libby) is perfect as the love interest of Dade, and plays this role perfectly. The always funny and crazy Matthew Lillard completes the cast of hackers.  As good as this movie is, you can really tell that they had a very small budget, and they rushed to put it together. The editor of the movie must have been sick the day he was supposed to screen it because it is full of mistakes, and scenes that are clearly out of order. This movie will only be liked by those who know nothing about computers, or those willing to sit back and enjoy a very well written story with a very good ending. Forget the mistakes, and you will enjoy this one! Besides, Angelina Jolie is in it!
