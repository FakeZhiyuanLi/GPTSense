      ive thought alot this morning ,yes the things i do hurt the ppl near me , ive done my best to keep them away for that fact .   you think i have all these women , when all there was one plus u. the things i say portray a different story , that just shows nobody is willing to see how it really is . everyone in my life never asked how it is or how it will be . they just think this is the way it will be .  from my past to now ive changed alot. its time i do that again . who will stay along for the ride .  from past experiances i havent seen a soul   so i leave the choice up to all , to stay around and change with me for the best , leave my side just like the rest

      what am i supposed to say  when everything has been torn away What am i supposed to do  when all i did was to try to love you  can u tell me where to start  begin again , so we dont part i want us to be ,for us to see that the things we need are inside of you and me  emotions got all twisted up  near the edge about to jump wont you help me get down from here it feel like your pushing me  seeing how much i have to fear  fear is not what i hold inside  its the love im trying to hide more than ive felt for others in life not too simple when your holding the knife  wounds so deep they always show doubts from you , minds ready to blow calm the fuck down and see the real before the door is close and then its sealed  i want the best and worst of you we can never seperate the two  ill give you all of me and all my time show you these words will come alive they are more than just a poem that rhymes  end this doubtful mind that sits wondering if you'll ever be his though and though , ill do what it takes  take all that shit , bury in the ground then you'll see inside my heart and mind ill be there for you , that you will find.......

      Ok , you all are reading this to see what is inside me and what makes me tick , well ive had time to think . It's time to lay out all the fuckin cards , im tired of having ppl telling me their feelings towards me without even showing me (i dont need names) .   I have a choice at hand and im not making a move until this shit it out in the open , so those who havent spoken on whats to come , say it now ...  i love all of you for what you've given me

      What am i supposed to do  when the only one i love is you what am i supposed to say  when all we've done is play  I've said i wanted to be with you With all these words , i see right through you I couldnt give a fuck today  Nothing will change ,It stays the same  I found someone that gives me life  Lifts me up but cuts me with her words , like a knife As you linger , waiting for me  Things are not what they seem  Twisted lies and playing games seeing who will have the fame the end is close , still no trust to know what you think is a must  doubt is in your mind  in the end you'll be left behind  we've fixed it all to some degree i let you take it real slow  while i try to figure whats real  She went away but then came back Dont know why , She will not say  All i know is she's here  She got what she wanted  Then she left  I guess thats the end  I gave without being given  It's time for me to start living

      Love , what is it ??  A Touch  A Taste A Kiss  Just a word Just a thought Meaningless to some  expecially the ones's who want to get laid Meaningfull to me  expecially to me when i know ill just fade  She wants me to love the way she does I dont love how you love She wants me to feel how she feels I dont feel how you feel  I'm the one to blame I feel no shame

      She fades like a thought  She comes back  She's the color in my world  So vivid , so full of life When she leaves , cuts like a fuckin knife  She will leave  Cus she see's no good  She thinks im just the same  Why i feel im the one to blame  Too many , Too few  Many old , Some new I guess i was one of the few  To ask for so little  Became to be too much   Fragments of her life  Some of her love Never to be said or even told  Her words i know would just be cold

      I'll be here all alone End everything around me  She's doesnt know where to go  I couldnt believe the words she said It was all the little things she said In my mind and in the bed   Now im here alone  Trying not to break my mind  Memories left to rewind   I cant believe what she said  all those little things she said  I'll never listen to those........words again                   She said   i cant deny the love i have Twisted and sick  Just like alice in wonderland  Just like the cheshire cat  She believes nothing is as it seems  Never thought she could be this way

      A bitter pill ,to numb the pain  A shot of you ,to keep me sane   As i watched you sleep in bed , all i new was dead  everyone could see my madness , everyone seen me lose control All my thoughts are twisted cus of the feelings you took  You wished for me to go away Everything was all in vain  Twisted emotions interwined with hate I sat on the edge of insanity waiting my fate  Take a look at whats become , our hearts beating like a drum It was all good , till the walls came crumbling down   Now we're all left with uncertainty , Some of us with guilt  Feelings still there , In the air of doubt  nothing to do but to sit and wait , while others hurt inside  well it makes me sick , makes me sad wishing someone was here makes me mad  i tried my best , ive done my   its time i lived without giving my heart everyones taken , ripped it apart

      You know things may change in time , but sometimes they still stay the same , Its just the perspective that changes not the person ...Ok now ive done some bad shit that i do regret , i never meant to hurt anyone in my life intentionally or otherwise .You know who u are if you are reading this , the chance was taken from me i think cus you thought i couldnt never of loved you or cared for you cus of the past , given that i dont know what you've been through that is understandable. But i was willing to give it my all to make you happy but conflict and doubt became our allies .I dont blame you one bit for your decision , it was my fault for not understanding why ..now that i know some of the why i will leave well enough alone and get on with my life ...to my own self be true .   So i hope you get you life together again and your !!%@^%^%#^ , either way if you u ever be needing some help or someone to talk to ill always be there for you no matter what ..   thank you for the memories you have given me , i hope i gave you some pleaseant ones too
