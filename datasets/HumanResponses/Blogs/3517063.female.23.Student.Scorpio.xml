         Ronald Reagan is finally dead. More so than for most presidents, his presidency defined its decade. Whether you liked him or not, he was definitely the most influential global personage during the 1980s.  His effect on the conclusion of the Cold War, which has been underestimated by liberals and Gorbachev afficionados, was definitive. His vision of the Star Wars project, mocked by so many, played a significant role in undermining the remaining vestiges of Soviet economic and military power by forcing the USSR to engage in an arms race it could ill afford.  As a European child of the 1980s, I cannot comment on Reagan's domestic US policies. I can only state that with historical perspective, much of the credit given to Gorbachev should rightfully have gone to Reagan and his administration. He brought back the 'war' to the Cold War, and thus accelerated its end. This is not to say that without Reagan the Cold War would not have ended. It would have. But it would have taken a few more years than it actually did.  The legacy of Reagan resounds in our current administration. Whether you loved, liked, or hated Reagan, his role in shaping US and global policy cannot be ignored. And whether you loved, liked, or hated Reagan, you have to be glad that he is finally free from that horror that is Alzheimers.

      I have often wondered whether cheese could be made from non-standard cheese-producing animals.  I've eaten cow cheese, goat cheese and sheep cheese, and I've heard of yak cheese. Why is there no pig cheese? Pigs are mammals. They produce milk. Why can't that milk be turned into cheese? I'm sure it would become a yuppie delicacy in no time. Or how about horse cheese? I can already see the menu - "Arugula salad with raspberry-caper vinaigrette, olive bread croutons and horse cheese," or "Pig-cheese asparagus ravioli with a champagne cream sauce."  So why not?

         Growing up abroad, I missed many of the classics of 1980s American sci-fi cinema. The task has now fallen upon me to make up for lost time, and view as many of these classics as I can.  Take RoboCop, for example. I just watched it for the first time tonight. RoboCop is among the cream of the crop of 1980s movies, and reflects the tensions as well as the socio-economic concerns of the age.  The young executives are symbols of the coke-binging extravagance of 1980s Wall Street and corporate America. The jokes are highly topical, referencing the Cold War climate of the Reagan years. And there are boobies, and luscious gore and violence galore. And of course, Detroit is a dystopic hell-hole, not so different from the reality of Detroit in the 1980s.  The best movies of the 1980s had more violence, more nudity and more innovation than today's movies. There was more of a moral subtext, and the distinction between good and evil was clear.   This is not because film directors were more creative at the time - rather, these movies were a product of the heightened tensions surrounding the end of the Cold War. They reflect a time when our understanding of the world was simpler, and global affairs were not as nuanced. My current affection for these sci-fi movies is itself a manifestation of my desire to return to a more straight-forward world. The late Cold War years were good years, and I miss them.

      According to some article, left-handed and right-handed people interpret humor differently. That still doesn't explain why I'm the only person who thinks I'm funny.

      So I checked AccuWeather to see what the forecast for the weekend is. AccuWeather informs me that Saturday will see "Rain, then a shower possible."  I know, I focus on semantics too much, but this is a truly perplexing weather forecast. If it is raining, then how do we differentiate rain from a shower? Is there a meteorological phenomenon known as a 'shower'?  Whatever it means, I expect tomorrow to be wet, with intermittent spells of wet, followed perhaps, by more wet.

      Mushrooms are a curious specimen. In effect, they are an extremely large edible mold. They come in hundreds of sizes and shapes, and nature has camouflaged some of the most deadly varieties to look as harmless as your favorite household mushroom.  The oddest part about mushrooms is that since they are already a fungus, it is very difficult to determine when they are no longer fresh enough to eat. Sometimes, but only rarely, they get another fuzzy mold growing on them. Sometimes, the caps get really strange and spongy. And sometimes they turn a funny color.   The effects of spoiled mushrooms are quick and vituperative. Within minutes, the stomach feels as if the mushrooms have expanded to an unnatural size or the victim becomes convinced that he/she is shrinking in the manner of Alice in Wonderland. In fact, Alice in Wonderland fails to address the problems arising from rapid shrinkage in height. Since her dress shrinks with her, we can only assume that her stomach contents does too, but this overlooks some lovely possibilities for embarrassing situations.  After some gastrointestinal discomfort, the effect of the spoiled mushrooms becomes more noticeable. A sudden surge in malodorous flatulence serves as a sign that the nasty stomach pains will eventually be over, and that no hospitalization is necessary. Unfortunately, during this period, no beings with a half-decent sense of smell can stand to be in your vicinity.  My cat, however, is nasally impaired. She crawled under the comforter in the midst of the eruptions and nestled herself under my derrier, where she promptly feel asleep.

      I stumbled across this article today on TotalFark, and I found it to be one of the strangest things I've ever read:  urlLink "Brooklyn Cheese Artist Makes Bed of Ham" .   What is a cheese artist? The byline for the article sort of explains it: Brooklyn Artist Who Painted Room in Mozzarella Cheese Begins Covering Bed in 312 Ham Slices. So clearly, this man creates art with cheese.  This is a picture of the creative genius making his 'bed of ham':    Cosimo Cavallaro, the artist in question, apparently moved away from the medium of cheese two years ago after he after he sprayed five tons of pepper jack cheese over a vacant house. His quote: "I was cloaking myself in cheese. I had started getting comfortable. I always need new boundaries."  And so he moved to ham.  All I can hope is that Cavallaro does not receive funding from the NEA. A madonna of feces is one thing, a bed of ham is another. What this man does is sacrilegious to the core - he wastes excellent cheese and processed ham to fulfill his twisted artistic goals. He would be better off shipping his materials to Africa.

         This may come as a shock to most people, but Richard M. Nixon is my favorite American president. Despite his shortcomings, he was no more crooked than most of his predecessors and successors. He had some attitude problems - and recent documents indicate that he was sloppy drunk at some point during the Six-Day War. Nevertheless, he had intelligence, and his policy decisions continue to impact the world today.  Besides opening up relations between China and the U.S., Nixon embodied the element of randomness that made his outrageous threats so credible. As my international trade professor enjoyed pointing out, Nixon would occasionally act on one of his outrageous statements, and as a result was much better able to wrangle concessions out of foreign entities. For instance, Nixon threatened Hong Kong that the U.S. would support China's immediate regaining of control over it unless Hong Kong agreed with U.S. trade barriers on textiles and implemented a voluntary export restraint. Hong Kong was just worried enough that he would follow through with that threat that the export restraints were quickly implemented.  Nixon was an economic president, and since to me, economics determines the course of politics rather than vice-versa, I will continue to argue that Nixon was one of the best presidents the U.S. ever had, and will maintain despite great criticism from my peers and family that he is my favorite president of all time.

      I haven't been a big fan of horses since I was a kid, and a horse tried to throw me a couple of times. Since then, I've vowed to stay away from horses - I will neither ride them, nor am I happy to be pulled by them. Horsepower will beat horse power any day in my book.  Nevertheless, for years I've harbored a secret desire. I want to go to a racetrack and bet on a couple of horses. I don't care if I lose. Ideally, I'd like it to be a small-scale race, where I can get betting tips from old drunkards and see the gritty side of horse-racing. The Kentucky Derby holds no appeal for me. The Triple Crown leaves me cold. The Budapest racetrack, on the other hand, is where I would like to bet on my first race. I envision it as being a place veiled in the sadness of lost pensions and paychecks, and tinged with the occasional joys of winning a small amount that might help buy new shoes for the children.  So go horsies! I'll put money on them and watch them race as long as I don't have to be anywhere near them.

      I decided to do a GIS for Central Asia, and Google presented me with this gem:     Apparently, as the corresponding website informed me ( urlLink the site in question ), these are some of the designs of Olga Sergeeva of Kyrgyzstan, a 'famous designer of Central Asia.'   What struck me the most was the woman who is standing second from the left. Either a) she is freakishly tall and could be in the WNBA, or b) the other girls are freakishly short, and she is in fact only average in height. The way she is standing also seems to indicate that she only has one leg - it seems like she is nestling the stump where her right leg would be under the breast of the girl on the left.  The same website informs me that there are about a dozen discos in Bishkek and that, most importantly, "there is a circus and a zoo for children and for the really young at heart". Be forewarned - if you are only slightly young at heart, the circus and the zoo are not for you.

      One of the most important questions that I face on a daily basis is what I will have for lunch. Some days, I spend hours determining what the best culinary option will be given the weather, my current mood, and any cravings I might have. The answer is never Thai.  Today remains enigmatic. I have no strong desires and since I am not yet hungry, my stomach cannot dictate my mind. Of course, it's only 10:30 in the morning, so I probably shouldn't be worrying about lunch yet.  I often wonder if those great artists - musicians, painters, writers - that starved in their tiny garret apartments ever found themselves creating works of art to fulfill their hunger. It would be most amusing if an analysis of van Gogh's paintings indicated that while painting some of them he craved beef stew and potatoes, and while painting others, he craved hot Indonesian food. Eventually, due to his poverty he was stuck eating a jar of hot Indonesian pepper sauce with nothing to accompany it, which drove him into such fits of madness as he attempted to quench the burning in his throat that he cut off his ear.

      I have a menu from a local Chinese restaurant that advertises among its roast specialities both roast pork and roast pig. I have spent considerable time trying to determine what the difference may be.  The initial assumption that roast pork is a piece of pork while roast pig is suckling pig is clearly incorrect, since the prices are identical, and both are served over rice. Although it is theoretically possible that an entire suckling pig would be served over a tiny bed of rice for the low, low price of $4.95, this is highly unlikely.  Maybe roast pork is adult pig, while roast pig is baby pig, but I've never seen pig products differentiated by age.  My only explanation is that roast pork is a pig product, while roast pig is the abbreviated name for 'roast long pig' and thus, by cannibal terminology, roast pig is human flesh.  Other roast products on the menu include 'soya chicken,' 'intestine,' and 'triple delight roasting.' The questions multiply - whose intestine? Is the soya chicken a tofurkey of sorts, made from tofu products, or covered with soy sauce and then roasted? I don't even wish to contemplate what 'triple delight roasting' might be.  Even more fascinating is the 'BBQ & Soy Sauce' section of the menu, which advertises such delectable products as 'soyed chicken' (not to be confused with above-mentioned soya chicken), 'soy sauce intestines' (again, whose intestines?), 'soy sauce chitterling' (speaks for itself), 'soy sauce pig tongue' (since there is no pork tongue on the menu, I will assume that this means pig rather than human), 'soy sauce duck tongue' (how many ducks does it take to make a plate of duck tongue?) and my favorite - 'soy sauce dish' (which I can only assume is a plate of soy sauce you give to your kitty to lap up).

      I suppose I should be writing posts about my crazy sex life and all the middle-aged balding men I've slept with in the past 24 hours. Unlike the Washingtonienne, however, my life is nowhere near as riveting. Unlike her, I have some self-respect. Between $400 and a nice dinner, I'd take a nice dinner. You'd have to pay me a lot more than $400, or nothing at all. $400 is such an insulting sum.  Instead I choose to envision the young lady in question attending a ball in the years before the French Revolution. I see her in a borrowed gown, trying to hob-nob with the aristocracy, invited to attend by a lecherous syphilitic old count, thin of purse but long in pedigree. She is a peasant, and like all other peasants, she is a sans culottes. This is why she is here. In exchange for a quick bang in the servants' stairwell, she gets a chicken. And back to the sewage-filled streets of Paris she goes, to gossip with her peers about her 'success' in that magical kingdom of wealth that belongs to the aristocracy.

      I only have two TV channels - ABC and CBS. So if I want to watch TV in the afternoon, the only available shows are soap operas. Today, I actually left the TV on during the afternoon while I wasted time online. After a couple of hours of being exposed to soaps, I no longer remember algebra.  So I suggest that the U.S. prison system should take away cable from the prisoners and instead force them to watch soap operas all day long. This will greatly reduce crime rates, since released prisoners will be incapable of doing anything more challenging than painting their nails and gossiping with their next-door neighbors.

      My school's brilliant career center decided to force us to resubmit our resumes for their new job-search website. They review each resume and approve them or deny them for publishing, suggesting certain changes.  Mine apparently had only a few incorrigible flaws, like daring to use italics and underlines. However, they did decide to comment on the content, suggesting that I perhaps had too much science and that this would make it difficult for me to find a position in international affairs. I suppose they want me to remove most of my science experience from my resume. Well, forget about it. I'm not removing five years of my life off my resume just because some snot-nosed career advisor thinks I should.

      Found an article today on Totalfark about Manul kittens, an Afghan breed that has the longest fur of any known species (see article  urlLink here ).  Besides the fact that this article contains barely any written information, it has some delightful pictures of the little kittens. Apparently they're incredibly rare, and these four kittens were born in a zoo in Germany.     They are insanely adorable, in my opinion - possibly even cuter than my favorite breed, the Norwegian Forest cat (Kissy is a Norwegian Forest cat). Unfortunately I doubt that I'll be getting my hands on one of these any time soon - they're being bred in zoos, so they're probably not easily available. Still - they sound perfect - grow up to 8 lbs in weight and you can make clothing out of their fur (not making this up - it says so in the article).     Rrrrowr! Somehow I don't think these little ones want to lose their fur.

         Today, I braved the crowds and headed down to 15th and Constitution to see the funeral procession for Ronald Reagan. It was blazing hot, in the upper 90s, and very crowded.   The military troops marched out in full dress uniform and came to a stop. For over half an hour, they stood there, fully clothed, waiting for the casket to approach so they could start marching. Well, the heat started getting to them, and one by one they begin passing out. The military medics were taking them out of their formations, pulling them aside, giving them water and making them rest. Eventually, it became a sort of a game with the crowd to see who was going to drop next. In fact, several people called over some of the medics and pointed to this gray and shaking soldier in one of the units and told the medics that maybe they should go to him, since he was about to drop. After helping him, the medics said 'good call' and went on. It was fairly amusing, although I think everyone felt really bad for those poor uniformed folk, since even in shorts and t-shirts and in partial shade, we were sweating up a storm.  Meanwhile, one shrill female police officer kept screaming (and I mean screaming) at people behind us to get down from where they were standing on the huge concrete flower pots. Her screams became more frantic with time. I sort of wanted to go stand on a flower pot, just so that I could be arrested and later, at job interviews, tell people when asked if I have criminal record that yes, I was arrested, for standing on a flower pot at Reagan's funeral procession.  Also amusing was the widespread use of cell phones. Sine we had no indication of when the casket was going to come through, various people called their friends and relatives at home who were watching TV, asking them where Reagan's body was now. This kept us fairly informed.  I don't think anyone around me actually saw the casket pass with their own eyes. We were all too busy snapping pictures with our snazzy digital cameras, held at arms length.   And while I stood there, I realized how profoundly the nature of mass public events has changed with the advent of modern technology. No longer are pictures limited to a roll of film - people snap away continuously, ignoring everything around them. No longer is there the suspense of not knowing what will happen next - cell phones keep us connected to other forms of media and let us know exactly what will happen when. No longer do people turn out to events like state funerals to mourn - the constant barrage of media images has taught us that whatever we believe in, we want to be at events that may be of consequence, even if only of insignificant historical consequence.  I thought it was pretty exciting, although the atmosphere was more reminiscent of millenium London than of a funeral procession, albeit with much less alcohol. I don't know if that's what the cowboy would have wanted, but that's what he got.

      In December, for the first time in my life, I will have to find full-time employment that isn't just a summer job. So I've been looking at the various openings posted by my school's job search program to try to determine what my options are. Unless I have more than five years of work experience, I don't have many.  Most jobs require one or more traits that I simply don't possess - fluency in Armenian, knowledge of Albanian, native Russian, experience managing NGOs, experience feeding refugees, experience in agricultural development, experience in setting up pyramid schemes in small developing countries, experience negotiating settlements between Hutus and Tutsis, etc.  Those jobs that I manage to be somehow eligible for have a geographic problem. They seem to be largely located in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Sierra Leone, or other such delightful places. My guess is that the organizations in need of employees have completely given up on trying to get qualified people to work in such places and will now hire anyone who is willing to move there. Which means that most of their employees are insane. I'd be willing to move there, but somehow I doubt that my friends and family would be overjoyed.  My major realization is that I'm overqualified to work in those jobs that I would have been eligible for after receiving my bachelor's, and underqualified to do anything else. This puts me in the odd situation where I'm likely to end up working at Starbucks because no one else will be willing to hire me. And after they taste my coffee, it's doubtful they'll want to keep me around.

      I finally watched Tadpole, on the recommendation of my best friend Steph. And I think I'm in love. See, I have an obsession with hands. I have ended relationships for no better reason than that I didn't like the guy's hands. Hands are very important. Hands define maturity, life experiences, psychological wellbeing, etc. And Tadpole, well, he loves hands.  My hands tell their own story. Pudgyish fingers tell me that I haven't done much physical work in my life. The muscularity of my hands shows that I'm not a completely useless human being, and that I've used my hands for something - I've played piano since I was 4.   How do I define an unacceptable hand? Hard to determine. Usually, it's a gut feeling. The biggest problem - small hands - and before you say anything, no it has NOTHING to do with THAT, and although, yes, I'm afraid of carnies, that's also not the reason either. Hands define a person. Looking at someone's hand may be the biggest first impression I get, both for men and for women.   Reading hands, for me, is like reading palms for those fake fortune-tellers, but more truthful and accurate. Hands alone are not enough, however. Brains are also required. The perfect man will have hands like my old piano professor, Mr. Laszlo, and the brains of my favorite prof from college, and will somehow be close to my age. Until then, I'll keep looking.

      I stumbled across this picture on the CNN webpage while reading the news today:     This strange work of modern art was accompanying an article on a new test that will permit earlier detection of anthrax exposure. ( urlLink The article in question .)  What struck me was how abstract, and yet cool and hyper-modern CNN's picture is. It looks more like the cover art for a new Anthrax album if Anthrax were to turn into a pop-alternative band than like the scary anthrax bacteria.   Needless to say, I'm really not sure what the picture has to do with anything other than having the word 'anthrax' written across it and having some quasi-bacterial shapes on it. Good job CNN! Clearly one of your graphic designers was bored and needed an assignment. I suggest that you also replace all of your photographs of world leaders with editorial cartoons depicting them. That would make reading the news much more fun.

      Sometimes, when I wake up in the morning, I look over at my cat and watch her sleep on the window ledge. She pushes the blinds back from the window so that the sun shines on her, and on my bed.  And like my cat, I suddenly become sleepy again, since there is nothing more stupefying and relaxing than the feeling of sun on my face. Unlike most people, who jump out of bed when the first light hits their eyes, I curl up into a ball, and go back to sleep. Sometimes, Kissy leaves her spot by the window and curls up next to me, and we sleep until the sun goes behind a cloud.

      So my parents finally acquired their new kitten - Nixon, otherwise known as Nixie. I have been unable to carry on a conversation with them since the cat was brought home. They have regressed to helpless baby-talk, and any attempt to have a serious conversation is interspersed by cries of 'awwww - you want to play with my toe?' and 'there she goes again - zoom.'  Hopefully I'll have a couple of good pictures to post later on. At the moment, Nixie hasn't managed to stay in one place for long enough for my parents to get a good picture of her.

      A new haircut is a marvelous thing. It provides a brighter outlook on the world and life in general, makes you feel light and airy, and puts a little spring into your step. At least if you're a girl.  I braved the incredible mugginess today to get my hair cut. And as I was walking home, not only did people yell from their cars (a rather common occurrence around my neighborhood for some odd reason) but I was actually offered a free cab ride by some cab driver. Needless to say I didn't accept, but I was oddly flattered. That was definitely a first, and considering that I wasn't dressed to kill (much too humid to contemplate wearing anything nice), I can only attribute it to my fabulous new haircut. I really should get haircuts more often.

      Well, I'm back. Slightly hungover, but back.  So, I ran across  urlLink this  article on TF (TotalFark - I'm getting tired of typing it out.) There is something very wrong with the newly redesigned (first redesign since 1981) US army uniform:     First of all, it doesn't look like it's any sort of camouflage, particularly not for anywhere that's green. Second, as this next picture shows, it looks like a cheap hunting outfit you'd find at a Michigan Kmart, designed to make you stick out in a forest, rather than blend in:     In fact, the only thing this uniform provides camouflage for is a stormy sky or perhaps a desert. Which leads me to a slightly alarming conclusion - this uniform was not designed to provide cover in greenery, because the US army won't be fighting anywhere green for a long time. Looks like we're in the Middle East for the long haul, at least if these new uniforms are any indication.

      The enthusiasm I had for my term paper has since died down. I am beginning to realize that trying to summarize the motivations of numerous countries and international organizations towards the resolution of the Nagorno Karabagh conflict in 8 pages or less is nearly impossible. Russia alone has already taken me 3 pages. I have yet to work through Turkey, Iran, the EU, the US, the OSCE and the UN. Since Russia is the most important influence on the region, I suppose it makes sense that so much of that section is devoted to its various ploys to reexert control over the Near Abroad.  Still, I'm at 25 pages (the assigned length of the paper)and I've got about another 5 to go. Followed by some intense editing, some fixing of footnotes and bibliography, and a massive prayer that my prof will find this version acceptable.

         I have always been an enthusiast of good documentaries. I am also fascinated by military strategy and defense issues. I have recently been reading Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and Machiavelli in an attempt to understand the theory of warfare.  The Fog of War is a brilliant documentary. In the best of documentary tradition, it relies not only on McNamara's reminiscences, but also on historical conversations and archival footage to emphasize the points being made. It's also highly relevant to the study of the theory of warfare.  Until I watched this, my main source of knowledge about McNamara was the Simon and Garfunkel song, "A Simple Desultory Philippic (Or How I Was Robert McNamara'd Into Submission)." I've never been much of an American historian. In fact, I could go so far as to say that I know almost nothing about American history.  Nevertheless, this is a brilliant documentary. Now if only they'd make one about my hero, Henry Kissinger...

      Last night I did one of (what I thought would be) the dorkiest things ever. I went out to meet some people I'd never met before at a bar. These were people from TotalFark. Now, I've been around the internet long enough to remember the days when if you were female and you got together with people from the internet, they were invariably male, had never left their mother's basement and were so terrified to be in the presence of the opposite sex that they either drooled or ran screaming.  In fact, last night proved to me that either a) the internet is changing for the better, or b) TF is just that insanely cool that people are not only funny online, but also normal, functional amusing human beings. It's probably a bit of both.  Everyone there was really normal, there were an equal number of girls and guys at the beginning, and the ratio then skewed so there was more girls, no one had any serious personality disorders (at least none that were readily discernable) and I actually got along with everyone. I normally hate most people - I'm not a very sociable person - but these guys were really great. And I had way more fun than I expected.

      I have been working on rewriting a term paper about Nagorno Karabagh for one of my classes. It's a bit of a drag - I thought it was fine before, but I had to reformulate my hypotheses to match the prof's guidelines.   Oddly enough, though, I'm starting to enjoy the rewriting process. Primarily because I have so much more to say now than I did a few months ago. What I have to say has nothing to do with new developments - not much has changed, despite some rhetoric about achieving a resolution. Instead, I find myself writing more about how the situation fits into a general theoretical framework. There's more writing that isn't footnoted, and I have a better understanding of motivations, particularly those of third parties. It's also nice that I can incorporate some of the research I did for another term paper on Russian foreign policy towards the Near Abroad. One of my case studies is particularly relevant in demonstrating how Russia's motivations have affected the negotiation process.  It's inspirational in a way - I am beginning to realize how much I've learned in the past year, not just about writing, but also about how to approach a research paper and how to think about regional concerns from a broader, more general perspective.

         He looks positively uncomfortable in this picture, In fact, Dylan looks like he's going to eat someone.  Bob Dylan has been my rock idol since I was a kid. But seriously - to paraphrase Jose Jimenez - "Please don't let them do this to him!"

      During my freshman year of college, an old high school buddy dragged me to see a rerelease of the movie the Big Chill. To this day, it remains one of my all-time favorite movies.  The Big Chill is a U of M story - it directly references Michigan football, Ann Arbor and other facets of U of M life that I profoundly miss.  And in some ways it encapsulates my friendships. Only, over the years, what I saw as my role has changed. First, I was Alex, the suicide victim (originally supposed to be played as a corpse by Kevin Costner). Then I was Nick. No longer. First of all, I'm really not a Vietnam vet, and I'm not impotent. Still, there's so much of my friendships in this movie.  Part of me has been hoping since I first saw this movie that I'd never be in this situation. That I'd never have to see how my friends' lives had changed, that I'd never have to go to a friend's funeral. Today, I see it more objectively. I know we're all going to change. And for the most part, it's for the better. And someone will die, and we'll get over it, and grow stronger because of it. Some of us will grow distant. Some of us will grow closer. And whatever happens, we'll always have Ann Arbor.

         There is something incredibly irresistible about Alan Rickman. As far as current movie actors go, he is much more talented and better looking than most. He helps make the Harry Potter movies watcheable, and looks better in black than any man has the right to.  I suppose I have a skewed view of what makes a man gorgeous. Until I was 15 years old, I thought Humphrey Bogart was the best looking man ever. It was very hard for me to accept the fact that he was dead. Bing Crosby similarly took a place in my heart. Again, it was hard to accept the fact that he was dead. Jacques Brel was another sex god in my young eyes. And yes, he too was dead.  Alan Rickman belongs in the category of actors who are also sex symbols. Although Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both good looking men, they have a bland, common appearance that prevents them from standing out from a crowd. Alan Rickman has the looks, the voice, and the talent. And he's alive. This is a definite plus.

      This is indeed an exciting day - the link to the Reuters article about Gypsies that I submitted was approved. Considering that I lurked for several years, and that it's been almost a year since I got my TF account (never bothered with a Fark account), I'm very excited.   Yes, I'm a dork. But still - it's kind of neat.

      According to  urlLink this  Reuters article, a Swiss court has decided that a group of Gypsies who lost family members during the Holocaust can rightfully sue IBM for providing punch-card tabulating machines that facilitated the extermination campaigns of the Nazis.  This is a particularly interesting connection, in my opinion, since the lawsuit is coming from one of the most underrepresented groups in Holocaust reparations - a group that is often denigrated for its lack of education and clan-type family groupings. Yet it is a Gypsy group who is suing IBM on very technical grounds. I'll be curious to see how this lawsuit develops, since it appears to be only a preliminary lawsuit designed to determine if a broader lawsuit claiming further damages will be feasible.

      As much as I love food, I've had a few unpleasant culinary experiences in my life - experiences that go beyond the simple concept of 'bad' cooking. Most of these experiences relate somehow to 'delicacies' of various countries. It is a little known fact that the word 'delicacy' really means 'crap we won't eat but feed to tourists who visit our country so that we can laugh at them behind their backs.'   I was raised to be open-minded, both about food and other cultures, and was told that I couldn't prejudge any food without trying it at least once (so said my parents - of course I later realized they were hypocrites - my dad refused to eat the scorpion he was served in China.) As a result, there have been moments were I was forced to smile at the host/hostess while consuming delicacies that were clearly not meant for human consumption.  I recall eating a tripe and brain stew in Hungary. This was a combination of textures and tastes that was simply not meant to be. I also consumed a rooster testicle stew in Hungary - this was surprisingly bland and undisgusting, however, and can hardly count as a true delicacy since I've never heard of anyone else being served it in Hungary. The worst was in Japan, however, where I was served some sort of fermented/pickled uni (sea-urchin ovaries) from a tiny jar that cost about $70. It was a great honor to be presented this delicacy, and I am proud to say that I managed to suppress both my gag reflex and my facial muscles and lived to tell the tale. It was notable that none of the Japanese people present at the dinner were partaking of this treat, and that is when I began to formulate my theory on ethnic delicacies and the true definition of 'delicacy'.  A recent article on the BBC webpage linked to from Fark (see article  urlLink here ) deals with a creation by a Ukrainian chef attempting to create a new Ukrainian delicacy. The dish in question - chocolate covered pork fat:     This magnificent dish, so reminiscent of Catch-22's chocolate covered cotton, is scheduled to become even more popular as tourists flock to the Ukraine now that a Ukrainian won the Eurovision song contest (not making this up - see the article if you don't believe me.)   My final conclusion on this is that a) the recent Ukrainian case reinforces my hypothesis on the actual definition of 'delicacy' and that b) Ukrainians are delusional in thinking that they will have a massive influx of tourists. Between chocolate covered pork fat, Ukrainian mobsters and pockets of high radiation, I'd recommend staying far far away.

      I just got back tonight from a blitz visit to New York City. I had a wonderful time, and discovered that I can travel from DC to NYC and back for the ridiculously low sum of $35. The Chinatown buses are absolutely brilliant.  New York is so unlike DC that it's scary. If I leave my apartment in DC wearing anything even moderately interesting (meaning, anything that could not have been bought at J. Crew, the Gap or Banana Republic) I get stared at like I'm some sort of mythical beast, or a giant tentacled slug. In New York, however, it really doesn't matter what anyone wears, because between everyone in New York at any given moment, every possible combination of clothing is being worn. It's sort of nice, really.  Also, New York is blessed with hot Israeli street vendors who like to flirt.  Furthermore, New York has my second favorite cafe in the world, which has my first favorite cappucino in the world - Dante's. It's almost as inspirational as the Muvesz cafe in Budapest, and if I could, I would go there every day and write the Great American Sci-fi Novel while getting completely wired on multiple foamy, strong cappucinos.

      I'm recovering from a night of drinking to celebrate/mourn my LSAT scores. I received them yesterday.  According to the scoresheet, I got a 178. Yes, that's correct, a 178. Of course I had to phone everyone to tell them the good news, and of course my parents pointed out that somewhere along the line I had lost two points (I believe they were joking, but still...) Looking at the answer sheet, I realized that three of the four question I answered wrongly were on the last section, which was logical reasoning. And that I could have scored a 180 had I answered two more questions correctly. In short, had I concentrated harder, I would have had a 180.  But seriously - I'm ecstatic. Couldn't be happier. Stayed up until 4:30 AM playing Trivial Pursuit with my boyfriend on my Xbox while getting wasted. I lost a lot. But I scored a 178, so things will be fine.  Good times, good times.

      Since my last cooking adventure went so well, I've decided to try it again. This time, however, I'm a little out of my element.  I'm attempting to make a sort of a lamb pot-roast. Since I'm rather impatient, I keep trying to look at it. So far, I don't think the lamb has done anything, and the vegetables are still cold. Also, the pan is rather full, so I can't poke and prod things as much as I'd like to.   If this ever manages to cook itself, I am going to try to make gravy. In my family, my mom roasts and my dad makes gravy. I usually just try to stay out of the kitchen. As a result, I'm completely unsure how this will work, although my parents have been kind enough to give me lots of advice.  I suppose that if this doesn't turn out to be edible, I can always order fried chicken, with a side of gravy french fries. Or maybe the gravy french fries would be too much of a humiliation after my botched cooking attempt. If Cluck-U Chicken can make gravy, then I can too.

      According to  urlLink this  article linked to from Fark, lefties are more prone to depression, drug abuse, bed-wetting, autoimmune diseases, suicide attempts, and being president.  None of these sound very good. I am a happy, well-balanced lefty, without any major psychological or physical problems. I am also not the president. I suppose there is some truth to all this, but I tend to categorize such information as part of the giant anti-lefty conspiracy that pervades every facet of society.  Of course, there is also a very large market for left-handed devices - I own a pair of left-handed scissors which I find invaluable. Some of the available devices are, however, nothing more than sales gimmicks. For instance, I recall being in a left-handed store with my parents, where my mom was excitedly pointing to a pair of left-handed manicure scissors and suggesting that she buy them for me. I gently pointed out to her that this made absolutely no sense, since in order to cut all ten of your nails, you'd have to switch the scissors from one hand to the other, thus invalidating any left-handed properties that those scissors might contain.  I'm proud to be a lefty. Now excuse me while I go and change the rubber sheets on my bed.

      I'm about to embark on another one of my cooking adventures. Sometimes I wonder why I keep trying, since the results are usually unpredictable, and the food is occasionally inedible.  Part of the problem is my unwillingness to use recipes. Cookbooks are for wusses, and real men make things up as they go along. Well, actually, real men just barbeque, but since I'm not a man, I'll let my statement stand.  My dad always told me that cooking was biochemistry and baking was microbiology. He has a point. However, I did exceedingly well in biochemistry, and I'm nowhere near as good of a cook. My baking is nonexistent - I never did understand the concept of yeast very well. That said, cooking is fun, as long as you treat it as a science experiment. Although with my cooking style, I'd have to say it's more like organic chemistry.  Biochemistry requires a certain degree of precision. And this is my cooking downfall. I cook like an organic chemist - it doesn't matter what I add as long as something, somewhere in the pan/pot tastes OK in the end - the cooking equivalent of recrystallization. Even if 29 out of 30 pieces of chicken taste awful, if one of them tastes right, then I've succeeded.  Now I'm going to go and attempt yet again to cook. I've got about a 50-50 chance that it will turn out all right. I'll just try very hard to think as a biochemist and hope that the mindset will give me the necessary karmic qualities to make a good dinner.

      If you had asked me last week whether I was excited to be leaving DC and going away for the summer, I would have told you that yes, I was incredibly, insanely excited and just wanted to get away from this dump for a while.  Things change rather rapidly in my life. I'm leaving on July 6, which is about a week from now, and although I'm looking forward to seeing my parents (haven't seen them in several months), watching the interaction between my cat Kissy and their cat Nixie, and going to Hungary for a nice long vacation, I'll be sorry to leave DC for that long. First of all, imagine the dust bunnies floating around my apartment when I get back. Everything will be coated in a half an inch of dust, since I am surrounded by construction sites. Classes will start the day after I get back, preventing me from reading ahead for the tougher courses. And I've finally actually met someone in DC who doesn't spend their life worrying about the latest HR resolution or what some Senate subcommittee has decided should be done about apple orchards in Oregon and their impact on the weapons industry. Finally, leaving in one week means that I have to start packing at some point, and there is nothing more distasteful than packing, organizing and cleaning. Sometimes I really wish I had a maid.

      I suppose that technically I still haven't finished my research paper - I'm a few paragraphs off. Once I'm done that should add about two pages.  I have to confess that I didn't just sit at home and work on it yesterday. I actually left my apartment. It was definitely scary - but at least I didn't leave while the big yellow orb was still in the sky. That might have turned me into stone. And at least I wasn't by myself. DC can be a pretty scary place - always have to watch for those Capitol Hill people with their Blackberries - I've been almost bowled over a couple of times.  Anyway, I'm pretty happy at the moment, despite my incompetent inability to complete the paper. And I don't have much to post about at the moment. Weekends are slow for news, and I don't have any pressing angsty issues that need to be resolved.

This is very exciting - I don't know a lot of Olympians, particularly none my age.  I'll have to make sure to watch TV and see him row - he'll be rowing in the men's pair, according to the U.S. Olympic rowing team's  urlLink website .   Go Art!

      Yesterday I received my new toy in the mail:     This was my reward to myself for my LSAT score.  The iRiver iHP-140 is an mp3 player with tons of features and 40 gb of harddrive space. It's sleek, snazzy, and only slightly thicker than the ipod. Additionally, it's not manufactured by Apple, which makes it that much cooler.   So far, I'm loving it. Looks great, feels great, plays great. And definitely works better than my old clunker, which had a tendency to overheat.   I love gadgets. Getting a new toy like this right before my upcoming vacation really makes my day/week/month. Until I realize that there's a better model out.

      I've settled back into life at my parents' house. I was awoken at 7:00 AM by loud radios blasting classical music, people running around, and cats hissing. After arriving yesterday only to find that the fridge's main content was a lump of moldy cream cheese, some out of date whipping cream and a loaf of moldy bread, I finally managed to go grocery shopping today. Picked up plenty of potato chips and some Lebanese food.  I also cooked up a huge thing of chicken in the oven this morning. My parents don't know how to buy things in small quantities. Always in search of the best deal, they frequent Costco where they buy packages of meat in ten pound increments. I suppose this explains why I spent much of my childhood eating the same thing for weeks at a time.  The cats have been rather amusing - Nixie is a tiny little fleaspeck of a cat with an incredibly loud hiss and a rather deep growl. Since Kissy and Nixie were introduced to each other yesterday, they've been sneaking around trying to catch each other unaware and pouncing. All of this is followed by lots of hissing. It seems as though they're playing, but you're not going to catch them cuddling up to each other in rapturous friendship.  My mother seems to require my presence for even the most mundane task - such as watching her put clothes into the washing machine. I'll be sitting, reading peacefully, when I hear my name yelled. I can ignore it for a little while, but she'll keep yelling until I show up. Then I stand around, leaning against a wall with my arms crossed,  watching her work.  Also, I'm not allowed to let anything touch the floor in my bedroom. And by anything, I mean, quite literally, anything - otherwise my room is instantly deemed a pigsty.  I suppose it's not so bad - it's only for a few days - then my parents leave, and my mother's busy working, so I don't see her that much. And my parents are very sweet, generous, kind, loving people - they're just a little bit crazy. And by a little bit crazy, I mean they're certifiably insane. But that's OK, they're the only ones I've got, and I wouldn't exchange them for anything.

      Finally, after many months of agonizing toil, my research paper on Nagorno Karabagh is done. I put it in an express mail envelope, wrote out the mailing label, and am ready to mail it. Unfortunately, the post office isn't open today.  Meanwhile, I am cleaning my apartment, doing laundry, ripping CDs, and packing my suitcase in a frantic attempt to get everything done that I need to get done before tomorrow morning. So far, I have a couple of tanktops, a few pairs of shorts, about nine pairs of shoes and some books on warfare packed. I don't see why I would possibly need anything else. As long as I have loads of shoes, I'm happy. Although maybe socks and undies would be useful.  I'm going to be gone for two months. This is a very long time. My fridge must therefore be completely devoid of anything even remotely perishable. For instance, the ketchup can stay, but the open cream cheese must go. The pickles will be OK, but the crumbled feta cheese won't.  So back to work I go - I would post more to my blog, but the process of getting ready to leave is a bit distracting.

Happy birthday, dad!  &nbsp;  Unfortunately, the fact that the laptop is on a chair and I'm on the floor in a rather uncomfortable position prohibits me from expressing my usual creativity.

      It's 2:19 a.m. and I'm pretty much all packed and ready to go. Yes, at 5:30 p.m. today I finally leave for Hungary for a long and (I think) well deserved vacation.  I will have intermittent internet from now until September 6. For my devoted readers out there (I think there might be as many as three of you) - fear not - I will post to my blog whenever possible.  Hopefully this will be one heck of a summer - a two week road-trip (with my mom) around Europe, friends visiting, sunshine, pork cracklings and beer. Hopefully I will actually get some work done on my brilliant science fiction masterpiece that has been lingering in a dusty corner of my brain. Hopefully I'll also have exciting stories to tell everyone without having to put my life in serious danger. Finally, hopefully I will be able to relax, unwind and get some of those incredibly painful knots out of my back.  Anyway. To all my homies out there - enjoy your summer, drink too much, and nurse a few good ol' American hangovers for me. I in turn will nurse some good ol' Hungarian palinka-induced hangovers and will lovingly think of all my buddies slaving away at summer or permanent jobs.   So long suckers!

      Cricket is one of those sports that I associate in my mind with colonialism, gin and tonics, and hot climates. I know very little about cricket, except that they play it in the former colonies and territories of the British Empire. Its rules escape me completely.  To me, cricket looks like some sort of school-related corporal punishment wherein people are paddled. I realize that smacking people on the bottom with the bats is NOT the purpose of the game, however I think that it might be a worthy addition to whatever rules already exist.  My boyfriend is a cricket fan. I think he actually understands what happens, because today he sent me  urlLink this link , very excited about New Zealand winning something or another (he's from New Zealand - not some random New Zealandophile who also happens to be into cricket - that would just be odd). Now, I don't tend to get excited about things I don't understand, so I'm going to assume that he understands the game.  I have always abstractly understood that people get excited about cricket, but it seems very strange that real live people actually do. I guess people get excited about baseball as well, so I probably shouldn't make fun of sports involving people running around fields.  I decided to give the article a read, assuming it would be a fairly straightforward thing, written in clear, plain English. What I got was something quite different.   For example:  "Lara had made 30 when he was trapped plumb in front as he shuffled across to a ball that angled in to the stumps (105 for 4). And then Dwayne Bravo, whose unhappy sojourn in the middle had produced just 4 runs in 14 balls, flicked a delivery straight to Styris at midwicket."  Huh? What? Stumps? 105 for 4? 14 balls? Midwicket? There are a number of numbers that make it sound like my probability class in college - maybe cricket is really a statistical method of determining the odds of amputees getting drunk that night.  Another gem:  "New Zealand's innings had been built around a classy 67 from Stephen Fleming, and a first-wicket partnership of 120 with Nathan Astle (57). But they lost their way in the home stretch, losing their last seven wickets for just 49 runs. Sarwan was the unlikely bowling star, scalping 3 for 31 – including the wicket of Cairns – and Tino Best, who had taken fearful punishment in his opening spell, then came back to mop up the last vestiges of resistance."  So now this has turned into a bowling alley, where things are scalped (possibly the players?) and people are punished (presumably with the bats). But never fear - at least the 67 is classy (how numbers can be classy is beyond me). Since the innings were 'built' around this number, it seems like at least part of cricket operates like bingo where you start building from a starting number to form a row. There is also the wicket of Cairns, which sounds like a magical artifact that gives certain teams special powers ("With the wicket of Cairns in my possession - I now cast FIRE upon you!").  In short - cricket involves amputees, statistics, bowling, bingo, beatings, scalpings and possibly some magical artifacts. Hey - it doesn't sound half bad, now, does it?

      Sometimes it takes a little distance to make you realize how great a place really is.  Today I drove to Ann Arbor. I hadn't been there in quite a while. It was a blitz visit, but while I was there I suddenly realized why I've been missing it so much recently.  Ann Arbor is a quintessential college town. Small, but with lots of restaurants and shops. Residential, but with transient college students. Lots of great music of all genres - folk, jazz, rock, and classical. Low crime rates. Academics everywhere. Basically, an ideal place to live.  Of course, it could just be massive doses of nostalgia tainting my vision with rosy colors. At the moment, however, I'd love to go back.

      Today is Sunday - a day of rest. At least for some. For me, this Sunday has started itself very poorly.  After going to bed slightly after 1 a.m., I quickly fell asleep, only to be woken up by my cell phone ringing. I have no reception here, so there was no point in picking it up. I was woken up again in the middle of the night by my parents' house phone ringing. Every night, the same person calls from a Flint phone number. No one picks it up anymore, but it is still rather distracting.  At 6:30 a.m., my parents' radio alarm went off. I woke up - listened to the news, and went back to sleep, too tired to get up and go to their bedroom to turn it off.  At 8:00 a.m. sharp, my parents called from Hungary. We spoke briefly, and then I decided to go back to sleep.  At 8:10 a.m., my parents' kitten Nixie decided it was time to rub her whiskers in my face, purr loudly, and sneeze a couple of times.  At that point I gave up. So I've been up since 8:00, desperately wishing I could go back to bed. I suppose I could. I probably will. But that doesn't stop me from being grumpy that my beauty sleep was interrupted so viciously so many times on a Saturday night.

      Hungary is a beautiful, hot country. I haven't done much of anything since arriving except for sweat.  However, my summer does seem to be developing in unplanned ways.   Originally, I was supposed to go on a two week road trip with my mom, our friends and our chauffeur from Hungary to Barcelona, where I was going to clubbing with my friend Andrew who's studying there, and from Barcelona back to Hungary via France and Switzerland. Well, since our friends bailed and my mom didn't want to undertake such a long trip without extra backup, it seems that she and I will be going with the chauffeur to Bosnia instead.  Actually, we're going to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia on one trip and then to Romania on another. I'm incredibly excited - particularly about visiting Bosnia which has a travel advisory out - watch out for demonstrations (they hate Americans) and unexploded land mines.  Ahhh Bosnia, the land of beauty and summer vacations...or not. We'll see. We're going to Banja Luka which has some Roman ruins and a coal mine.   So that's one change in my summer plans. The other change is less of a change and more of a very pleasant addition. Richard, my boyfriend, will be coming to visit me in Hungary. I guess my persuasive powers were sufficient to convince him that this is a really cool country. Or maybe he just wants to see me. Who knows.  Anyway, that's it from my end. I'm going to continue doing nothing until I have to go somewhere and do something. I feel that this is the right attitude to approach a summer vacation with.

      Yes, today I am posting frequently to my blog. Lots of fun info about Bosnia.  The Lonely Planet guide tells me in its "off the beaten track"  urlLink section  for Bosnia (as if the whole country weren't "off the beaten track") that Banja Luka, where we will be going has the following attributes:  "This important crossroads on the Vrbas River in north-western Bosnia is now known to the world as the capital of the Republika Srpska. Never much of a tourist centre, in 1993 the local Serbs made sure it never would be by blowing up all 16 of the city's mosques. About the only things worth visiting are the 16th-century fort along the Vrbas and its overgrown amphitheatre - its benches were burned for fuel during the war. The presidential palace in the city centre has been the seat of Bosnian Serb government since January 1998."  Sounds excellent. Blown up mosques, burnt amphitheaters...just the kind of idyllic vacation spot we all look forward to spending time in. I can't wait.

      Next week Tuesday, we are leaving for our grand tour of the Balkans. In preparation I opted to do some reading online. This is from the  urlLink Lonely Planet guide :  "Travelling by car is again an option throughout most of Bosnia and Hercegovina, although some roads remain in poor repair from war damage, and there's a fair chance you'll experience a carjacking. To top it off, the locals aren't the world's most cautious drivers - drunk driving incidents are on the rise - and service stations are scarce outside the big cities. If all this doesn't deter you, your best bet is to convoy with other vehicles and do all your driving during daylight hours."  This sounds pretty fun to me. Carjacking, bad roads, drunk drivers. At least we won't be doing much more than driving to Banja Luka from Croatia and back.

      It’s raining cats and dogs here. Today and yesterday, it’s been raining kittens and puppies, to be precise. A constant dripping stream. The day before yesterday, however, it rained panthers and wolfhounds all day, filling the gutters and making me very sleepy and very hungry.  I’m beginning to resemble an overinflated beach ball. Two plus weeks of rich, earthy Hungarian food have taken their toll. Mutton stew, venison stew, fried chicken, roast chicken, grilled steak, grilled ribs, salads made from mayonnaise and corn, salads made from mayonnaise and cabbage, salads made from mayonnaise and green beans, pastries, deep-fried dough, sausages, salamis, pork cracklings, goose cracklings, goose liver, meatless bacon grilled over an open fire dripped onto bread, sausage flavored potato chips, cheeses, sour cream – and that’s all just for breakfast.   You go to someone’s house for dinner or for lunch and there is never just one kind of meat. No, there has to be at the very least two kinds, or else that’s a poor offering. And at least three different ‘salads’, if mayonnaise laden dishes can be considered salads. The Hungarians even have a ‘hot dog salad’ (no joke) which consists of mayonnaise, hot dog slices and onions. There also has to be enough of each type of food on the table that everyone there can have at least seconds. It’s also impolite to refuse too much, so you find yourself eating ludicrous quantities of food. It’s like being at an all-you-can-eat buffet and being told that you have to eat it all.   Today we’re making deep-fried dough. I just finished my breakfast of leftover sour cream-cheese-ground pork-noodle casserole with some chocolate pastry as a starter. In a couple of hours, it will be time for deep-fried dough with garlic and/or sour cream and cheese on top. Then, we’re going to make a noodle dish for dinner, consisting of layers of poppy-seed filling, walnut filling, jam, cottage cheese and sour cream and sugar and whipped cream interspersed between layers of noodles. That’s just a light supper. Probably during the day I will eat some salami – a bite here and a bite there, or maybe a slice of fresh bread from the bakery with ground-up pork cracklings which is sold in the form of a crunchy spread, reminiscent of peanut butter, but oh so unhealthy.  I still haven’t figured out whether it would be good for an anorexic person to come to Hungary for treatment or bad. Part of me thinks that the Hungarian ability to concentrate calories into small-seeming items (known here as ‘calorie-bombs’) would make an anorexic gain weight. On the other hand, the girls here seem to have adopted the heroin chic look for their trend and all look like they’ve been starved for years. It must be part of the Hungarian depressive nature – they’re clearly gluttons for punishment if they can bypass all of the amazing food.

         The Mostar Bridge, reopened on July 23, 2004   In the beginning there was Barcelona. In the end there was there was Bosnia. In between there were various variations on a Balkan theme. How we ended up in Bosnia is a story in and of itself – particularly how a planned stay of 12 hours turned into a 4 day vacation. In the last minute, there was a mutiny, and plans for Ljubljana, Zagreb and Serbia were scrapped, leaving Bosnia.  After having traveled around Bosnia for 4 days, I feel that Bosnia has been accorded a bad reputation due to its past. We encountered no difficulties, experienced no hostility, and had nothing but good impressions of the country. Undoubtedly, unexploded ordnance is a problem if you’re not in the least bit careful, but this is no reason not to visit Bosnia. The desire to rebuild the tourist industry is there. The tourists aren’t.  Going to Bosnia is not like going to Afghanistan. There is infrastructure. There has been considerable investment, and much of the country has been rebuilt. The natural beauty alone is a sufficient attraction to bring tourists, but the old parts of the major towns are beautiful themselves and worth visiting.  I hope that my account of my vacation will encourage people to look at Bosnia with a more open mind and consider the possibility that after war, there is hope for rebuilding a vibrant tourist industry.     August 4, 2004   By 6:45 a.m. we are on the road – heading straight for Croatia and then on to Bosnia. I worry about the potential waits at the border – the Hungarians are fond of telling tales of border horror, complete with thorough baggage searches, cavity checks, machine guns, and waits of up to a day and a half. Needless to say, there are no problems. The Hungarian-Croatian border is empty, and the 4 Hungarian and one U.S. passport are quickly examined, only the U.S. passport receiving a stamp from the Croatian border guards. And then we are in Croatia.  Surprisingly, even here, in northern Croatia, signs of the war are everywhere – here an abandoned house, possibly that of a Serb or a Bosniak, there the marks from a spray of machine gun fire. Nevertheless, the majority of houses are well-kept – neat lawns with colorful flowers.  We briefly stop in Ossijek for a cup of coffee and a walk. Here, more buildings are scarred by shrapnel and bullets.  And on we go, towards the Bosnian border. Few of the cars coming in the other direction have Bosnian license plates. In fact, there are few cars coming in the other direction. I begin to worry. What sort of line might await us at the border? Northern Bosnia, being the Serbian part (Republika Srpska), might not have good relations with its Croatian neighbors. They might drag us out of the car and shoot us. At that point I realize that although the line might be long, there is no way the Bosnian border guards regularly shoot travelers. That would probably make the news.  We approach the border. The Croatian border guard flips through our passports before letting us through. Then we come to the line. Truck after truck wait at the border. Of course, as a passenger minibus, we just bypass them all. Here is the Bosnian border. The only other car is a red Lada. Clearly, not many people go to Bosnia. What would they do with our passports? The answer – precisely nothing. A quick flip through them to see the pictures and we’re through.  Bosnia. Since I was a child and saw the first images of the war, I have wanted to come here.  Here it is immediately clear that there has recently been a war. Everywhere there is construction – houses without plaster, built out of red bricks. In front of every house hangs a line with laundry – usually across the second story.  In the Serbian part of Bosnia they use Cyrillic, albeit a slightly strange variation that uses the letter ‘j’. In the south they use the Latin alphabet, a pointed reminder of the fundamental fissure that continues to plague the region.  We stop in Doboj to exchange some money. There is an ATM here that takes Visa. The city is ugly – not because of war, but because of its architecture.  Leaving Doboj, we see the alphabet change. We are now in the Bosnian-Croatian part of the country.  Some of the information I acquired before leaving appears to be outdated. In fact, it is something like traveling through Japan with a 1946 guide book. Some of it is quite correct, however.  Incorrect: There are hardly any gas stations. In fact, new gas stations are springing up everywhere.  Incorrect: The roads are terrible. At least the main roads are quite good, newly repaved and carefully marked.  Correct: The Republika Srpska is much worse off than the south, despite having had fewer scars of war. As soon as we hit the mountainous Bosnian-Croat part, the signs of war become more evident – walls without roofs, gutted houses. At the same time, there is more construction and the houses are better kept. There is clearly the hope of future tourism – hotels, restaurants line the road in the middle of nowhere.  Also correct: Bosnians are terrible drivers. They pass each other at alarming speeds on the twisting, narrow mountain roads. More than once, our driver has to suddenly brake, because in Bosnia, drivers seem to brake at the exact moment when they reach their turning point – not a second before.  Not all settlements have been similarly scarred by the war. Where there are minarets, however, there is a good chance that many of the buildings are new. Most of the minarets, in fact, appear to be prefabs – replacing whatever the Serbs destroyed. There are many new graves in the Muslim cemeteries that we pass.  The scenery is spectacular – it’s a singularly wild, mountainous region. Nature harbors no sign of war. Nestled in the valleys and on the hills, however, are ruined buildings. One especially ruined region is struggling to survive – a few lone houses are being rebuilt amidst the ruins, while a flock of sheep grazes among a meadow that was once the garden of a bombed house.     Ruined house on the road to Jajce, picture taken from the car   Many larger towns seem mainly unscarred and you wonder how the war bypassed them, until you notice that most of the buildings are pockmarked and bear shrapnel scars.  Yet everywhere, life goes on. People build 3 story houses and leave the upper 2 stories completely unfinished in hopes of better days to come.  Despite rumors of the unavailability of soft drinks, there are tiny one-roomed stores everywhere, often in the remaining floor of a destroyed house, selling an assortment of chips, Fanta, potatoes and melons.  Towards evening we are still on the road, and in the darkening mountain twilight we see smoke rising eerily from the chimneys. There are no gas lines here – never have been, and electricity is expensive. So they use wood, which is plentiful in the forests. Most of the roadside restaurants have big metal boxes outside, open on one side, in which a whole sheep, head and all, roasts on a spit above a wood fire.  Throughout our travels in Bosnia, many of the cars we see have German, Swiss, Austrian and even Dutch license plates. I do not hear anyone speak any of these languages, and it has become clear that these are Bosnians who work abroad and have come home for their summer vacation. Every now and then you see a German car turn into some unbelievably narrow dirt road, clearly going home to see family.  Finally we reach Jajce, at 7:30 p.m. Along the way we have seen a number of SFOR troops, a reminder of the fragility of Bosnia’s recent peace. The road into Jajce takes us past an electricity generating plant which has an open wall through which you can see the open fires of what appears to be molten iron.  Jajce was pretty badly bombed by the Serbs. Ruined buildings stand at the outskirts of town. We stop at the Hotel Tourist and get two rooms. The rooms are fairly expensive (as I had read before leaving) and rather primitive – the shower has no curtain and the carpet seems to be a remnant of the Communist era. The food in the restaurant is good however, an indicator of food to come – lots of meat and potatoes with a lovely woody flavor. Hysterical giggles ensue over the currency – the Bosnian Mark is called the Konvertible Mark, or the KM. When looking at a menu, or any other prices, the natural instinct is to say that the cost is in kilometers. As a result, for the rest of the stay, we describe everything in terms of kilometers.  We decide to go take a walk. Occasionally, the sidewalk disappears, obliterated by a shell. The old city is at first glance somewhat depressing. We walk among ruined buildings, but where you would expect a gloomy silence, there are sidewalk cafes, blasting music as people mingle and wander in the streets. Life goes on.    August 5, 2004      Jajce - old town   The morning brings a heavy misty fog to the valley. We have a 1976 Yugoslavian guide book, which tells us what the sights of Jajce are. This is the first of many such occurrences – many of the sights described in the book no longer exist, destroyed during the war.  There is a certain point when you become desensitized – the ruined buildings no longer catch your eye in the same way. We clamber around some ruins, despite the U.S. travel warnings that ruined buildings should be left alone due to the threat of landmines.  Most interesting are the catacombs, which we are fortunate enough to get a chance to visit. It was in these modest catacombs that Yugoslavia was founded by Tito in 1943. The guide, who spoke English, makes it clear that she much preferred life as part of Yugoslavia, a sentiment that is echoed by others around the country.  And on we go – destination Sarajevo.  Sarajevo has always been a place I wanted to visit, since I read Zlata’s Diary, the story of a young Sarajevo girl, when I was a young girl myself. We wind our way through the mountains, and as we approach Sarajevo it becomes clear that this region was brutally ruined by the war. All of the buildings are new. Many buildings stand empty, deserted by their owners, who either fled elsewhere or were killed. The road into the city is crowded – cars, trucks, SFOR troops – there are many more troops near Sarajevo than near Jajce.     Gutted building at the outskirts of Sarajevo, picture taken from the car   We make it into the city center after passing burned out apartment blocks, department stores and other buildings. The metal roof of one shopping center seems to have melted in despair. The city center is quite the contrast. Obviously there has been investment, and like everywhere else in Bosnia, there are large signboards that advertise who has sponsored the reconstruction – the EU, UNDP, USAID, etc.  We go into the Turkish bazaar where vendors insist on speaking English, and crowds mill. I buy a very tacky souvenir – especially tacky given the sad history of the last decade. It is a pen, made from a rather large bullet casing, with some engraving on it and the words ‘Sarajevo’ and ‘Bosna’ engraved on it.     One of the quieter alleys in Sarajevo's Turkish bazaar   Again, I realize that Bosnian food was designed for me. We order cevapi which appears to be ground meat sausages (that look like dog turds) in a big, fried dough pita. Unlike the Lebanese pita, the Bosnian pita is leavened, and awfully good. We finish it off with some Turkish coffee accompanied by a rose-flavored jelly.  The next excitement is the toilet. The toilet consists of a hole with 2 footprints. Luckily I’m wearing a skirt. Meanwhile, the muezzin’s voice blares from the multiple mosques, and scarved women wander the streets.  Sarajevo is so lively in the bazaar area that it is easy to forget that there has been a war. The hilly nature of the city means that it is easy to avoid seeing past the rebuilt areas. We only spend a short amount of time there, before heading on to Mostar. I promise to myself that I will definitely come back here at a later date and explore it further.     The road to Mostar, picture taken from the car   The road to Mostar is incredible. Its natural beauty is unbelievable, reminiscent of a very wild Switzerland, with smaller mountains, fewer houses, fewer people and scars of war. It is at this point that I decide that someday I will have a summer house in Bosnia. Somewhere in the mountains. Something simple, so that if it is ever bombed, I can easily rebuild it.  It is early evening as we approach Mostar, and it is raining. For miles now, there have been shattered buildings lining the roadside and the hills. Not one building appears to have survived intact. Somehow none of this sinks in until we enter Mostar. As we drive through the city, we realize that almost every building is a shell. Many are under construction, but few are more than a few walls. I have never seen such total annihilation. All of the destroyed houses that we have seen until now seem meaningless in comparison to the scale of Mostar’s destruction.  We drive around looking for a hotel when a man on a motorscooter comes up to use and greets us in Hungarian. He indicates that he wishes to talk, so we pull over. Are we looking for a place to spend the night, he asks in German. Yes, we say. He tells us to follow him and he’ll take us to a place where we can get lodging. It’s very clean, he says, and new. It is 250 meters from the old bridge.  At the moment our only other option is the large Communist-era hotel we saw coming into the city. After last night’s Communist-era hotel, however, we’re ready for a change.  We follow him through the winding streets and finally get there. Instead of 250 meters it is about 1 kilometer from the old bridge, but that doesn’t matter.  We take a look at the place. It is right off the main highway, and is a newly reconstructed building with a shop underneath. The place is indeed clean, and new. The bedroom are Spartan, but what else would you expect in Mostar after a war. We ask the price, and are told that if we pay upfront we don’t have to give our passports. Like everywhere else in Bosnia, the Euro is as much the currency as the Mark. In fact, there have been occasions where change is given in Euros. The Bosnian Mark is fixed to the Euro so that 1 Mark = 0.5 Euro.  After paying, we realize that the hotel is locked from the outside every night from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. This is not acceptable. I explain to the man that my mother does not want to be locked up and that we need a key. He makes a phone call, agrees that we’re right, and says that by 9 p.m. there will be a front door key for us in the store below, which is open until 10:30 p.m.  As we enter the hotel again, the power goes out. Somehow, this is not surprising. I go outside and down to the shop where one of our traveling companions is buying a watermelon by candlelight. An elderly Muslim woman holds the candle as he taps the melon. This is somehow perfectly appropriate for Mostar.  A few minutes later the lights come back on.  We eat the watermelon on the balcony of our room. I still can’t believe I’m in Bosnia – and not only am I in Bosnia, but in Mostar.  We head out to find some food. It is dark out, and there are giant locusts. We come to a clearing where amongst the ruins we have a perfect view of the newly rebuilt bridge of Mostar. The bridge is lit up, and from where we stand, we can see crowds of people thronging on the bridge, staring out in wonderment. The sight sends shivers down my spine. More than anything, the destruction of this bridge was the symbol of the senseless destruction that accompanied the Bosnian war. It has only been open for two weeks, and Bosnians are flocking to Mostar to admire it and celebrate peace. The human spirit refuses to be suppressed.  There is a great deal of life in Mostar at night. All of the shops and cafes are open until late, and people are out in large numbers. After dinner, and some Sarajevsko beer, we head out for a walk. The old part of town on either side of the bridge has been largely rebuilt, and with the crowds of people, the music and the darkness, it is hard to imagine that most of the city is still in ruins.  We arrive back at the hotel, where we have a key to the front door and retire for the night. Again, I cannot help but marvel at how life goes on and as I fall asleep on the child-sized bed (I have the third bed in the three-bed room) I feel certain that I will return to Bosnia many more times.    August 6, 2004   We wake up early in the morning and go out to see Mostar by daylight. By daylight, the damage is more visible – only the very heart of the old town has been rebuilt. The rest is still mostly ruined.  The bridge is as beautiful in the morning as it was at night. I notice that there is a stone, one of the original stones of the old bridge, lying at the foot of the bridge that says “Don’t Forget 93.” It’s hard to forget it when so much of the city is scarred.  As in Sarajevo, the Turkish bazaar is jumping, with vendors selling souvenirs of various types. I buy a T-shirt that says “Mostar” with a picture of the bridge and “Bosna Herzegovina” underneath it.  Throughout the trip, I have been drinking inordinate amounts of coffee – Bosnian coffee is strong and flavorful, both when served as espresso and when served as Turkish coffee. Today is no exception.  We wander around Mostar, enjoying the vibrant life and the rebuilt buildings. We even visit a mosque before stopping for lunch.  Lunch is exquisite – a very long dough stick stuffed with ground meat and onions. Hard to describe, but really a perfect combination of flavors.  Close to the old town is a market, and we marvel at the variety of fruits and vegetables. Everything is huge, fragrant, and unusually attractive. Some of the selections are unfamiliar – someone is selling something that looks like miniature okra. At another stand I wonder what the giant plastic bag of herb looking stuff is. We at first think it’s tea, but the vendor manages to convey to us that it is an enormous bag of freshly dried Balkan tobacco.  Past the market is a butcher, and in the window hangs an entire dead sheep – head, teeth, eyeballs – everything. We go inside, where there is a big selection of different cuts of meat, internal organs, and a whole cow’s head, again with teeth and eyeballs.  As we move away from the old town we see more and more destroyed buildings, as well as another lovely mosque where we run into the man who directed us to the hotel. He gives us a discount rate to look at the mosque, which we do.  Across the street from the mosque is one of the most haunting sights of the trip. A brand new Muslim cemetery, where every gravestone’s date is 1993, except for the few that read 1994. Since the bridge was blown up on November 9, 1993 (by the Croats – I have given up trying to understand who blew up what when and how during that war), I feel especially sorry for those who suffered for a few more months before dying in 1994. Some of the gravestones are of people born in 1980, like me. One is of someone who was born and who also died in 1993. Throughout the countryside of Bosnia, there are many new cemeteries, particularly Muslim ones. This is the first one we’ve seen up close.  The closer we get to the periphery of the city center, the more destroyed the buildings are. I look up at one, an ugly Communist era building, and notice that it has “Happy New Year” written across the top. Happy New Year indeed.     Mostar - Happy New Year building   Further on, we come to a major square. Every building in the square has been destroyed. One of these buildings is the former music school. They are trying to rebuild it, but a sign says that they are still looking for investors. War does not come cheap.  Mostar does have its more cheerful aspects. Namely, its cats. Mostar, being a mountain town, seems to have developed a purebred local cat that looks remarkably like an Abyssinian, with a long face and fine limbs. It comes in different colors and markings, and is clearly a street cat. I surmise that centuries of inbreeding have made it such a beautiful and unique species.  The cats are extremely sociable, and enjoy being scratched. I begin to hatch a plan – next time I go to Mostar, I will take a couple of female and a couple of male cats back with me and begin to breed them. I will start a new breed of cat – the Mostar cat. The purpose – to help rebuild Mostar. I will breed the cats and sell them at a high price and send a majority of the profits to the citizens of Bosnia. Americans love helping people. I would make money, Bosnia would benefit, and I would have lots of pretty cats.  After spending a few hours in Mostar, we leave, headed for a town called Positej which has a ruined medieval castle (not war ruins, just old ruins) on the top of a hill.  This small village is architecturally fascinating. There are no roads – everything is built into the hill, and the paths that lead up are all stairs. Many of the buildings here are under construction – even this tiny place suffered during the war. Of course, since there are no roads, the citizens have to reconstruct everything manually.  We climb up to the castle and look down at the river and the town below. The view is spectacular – so tranquil that it is impossible to imagine any violence occurring here.  From Positej we head back towards Jajce on a different road, beginning our slow return towards Hungary. My head spins with everything I’ve seen, and I continue to gaze out of the car window at every passing sight. By the time we reach Jajce I’m exhausted.  In Jajce we decide to try the other hotel in town, since we were not overly enthusiastic about the Communist one. The hotel turns out to be brand new, beautifully appointed, with completely Western fixtures, and is a lovely change. Luxury is sometimes necessary.  My mother, our driver and I share a suite – the theme of the suite is Tito. Apparently every room in the hotel has a theme – ours happens to be Tito. There are pictures of him everywhere, and a small bust of him on the writing desk. It is palpable in Bosnia that people yearn for the old days – the days of Tito. This merely reinforces that impression.     Jajce - The Tito Suite   I conk out early – I’ve already seen Jajce, both by day and by night, and I’m tired. I have seen more in a few short days than I usually do in a year. My eyes are simply incapable of staying open any longer.    August 7, 2004   We take things easy in the morning as we get ready to head back to Hungary – this time through Banja Luka.  The road is beautiful – they all have been. We are fairly focused on driving – it is a 12 hour drive, and we’re all fairly tired.  Surprisingly, Banja Luka is rather beautiful, although it irks me that as we pass through it I see no scars of war whatsoever. It seems unfair that when so much of the country was ruined, Banja Luka managed to get away without major damage due to it being a Serb city.  As we drive through Banja Luka I see an even more irksome piece of graffiti – “I’m proud of myself because I’m a Serb” – perfectly written in English. Tensions definitely remain in Bosnia.  The border crossing is again a breeze – the Bosnians don’t even look at our passports, and the Croats are also very quick.  Since we are taking a different road through Croatia, we pass different towns. This region has been heavily hurt by the war. Parts of it look worse than Bosnia. In one town, in particular, it appears that every single building was destroyed. Driving through the town we come across a long row of wooden barracks by the railroad tracks – temporary housing put up by relief agencies for the homeless citizens. Nevertheless, the temporary housing is emptying as people rebuild their houses, often in front of the ruins of their old houses.  Our return to Hungary comes so swiftly that I have to stop and wonder whether this whole trip was real. The thought that I finally have seen Sarajevo after all of these years, and have traveled through Bosnia by car is somehow unreal to me.  Some might expect me to become a pacifist after this trip. I’m not. I saw what war can do, and it isn’t pretty. But then again nobody ever told me it was pretty. What I gleaned from this trip is that humans are destined to survive – we’re the mammalian equivalent of cockroaches – you spray Raid all over us, some of us die – but we’ll be back – in the same places we were before. And this is a great thing. It’s a validation of not only mankind’s existence, but also my own personal existence, and it makes me realize that no situation should ever be treated as hopeless or as impossible.  Besides – Bosnia is just plain gorgeous. And that’s as good of a reason as any to go back and visit frequently.
