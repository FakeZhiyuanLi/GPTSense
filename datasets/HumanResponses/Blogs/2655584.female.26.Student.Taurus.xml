      so for years i have always had guys want to fuck me.  i know this sounds conceited, but i am not trying to be.  there are different classes for girls "take home to mom" and the kind you just want to "fuck."  somehow i end up in the fuck category no matter what.  no one  really  wants a relationship with me.  so for years i wondered why i was the "fuck me" girl. well... tonight i got the answer!  marvin's (he is my "x",)anyways, his guy friend came over and watched a movie with him.  i was playin on the computer like a loser. so the movie gets over with and they shoot the shit.  then marvin goes to bed.  then his friend stays and starts talkin to me. we use to talk sometimes and had mini make-out sessions that led to jack shit cause he is as emotional as a dead cat and was so not into it and just going through the motions.  anyways, so he talks to me for like 2 hours, intellegent conversation for the most part.  then... i am all smokin outside (cause i smoke again for some reason)and the next thing he is like... actin' weird.  and i am feelin' all insecure cause i look like ass and he is lookin at me..and then he starts to ask something and stops so i said what...and he goes... nothing ... and so i said... no what... knowing damn well what was gonna happen.  then he says it would be cool to make out or something with me.  yea. so after me saying no and then "wow"ing him with my "clairvoyent" powers (called perception!) he got over it.  no humping mae tonight!  so, he is all hanging around and feelin weird so i tell him he can leave, cause i know he wants to since he aint getting no action.  so he feels all bad.. la la laa... and then he attempts to talk to me again to make me feel better or something.  anyways, i dont give a shit cause this always happens ya know.  so i ask him what makes me have the "fuckme" aura around me.  and his answer was this: girls who are outspoken seem confident.  that is attractive.    they speak their minds.  they are blunt.  they can talk about sex without blushing.  it is a turn on.  it also seems really forward.  inother words guys think that chics who talk a lot and speak about anything and everything means that they like to fuck.  mmm... okay?   so i need to be more demur, shy, not think outloud 24/7...yea... oh well.  that wont ever happen!   so back to being the "fuckme" girl. dammit.

      friends. i dont have many.  i dont trust people.  but i thought that knowing someone for almost 8 years would count for something.  dating for 2 of the years.  sleeping together off and on for who knows how long.  having a 4 yr old kid together.  living together off and on.  talking about stupid shit and then real shit sometimes. but he is the "x."  i guess i expected a friend, not just someone who has to put up with me.  i thought things were better.  yea, we talk, though he tells is friends what i say.  i am sure it is a good laugh for all of them.  nothing is funnier than your "x" and her issues.  when in doubt you can always complain about everything she does wrong and how she ruins your life. i am sure he does. he always goes out.  i wonder if it is opportunity or what.  he can go out cause i am here watching ethan.  i am here a lot- since i am homeless.  it feels like an insult that he does not want to hang around.  instead- to up and leave all the time and go watch a movie with someone else.  i just dont get it.  sometimes we are cool, other times we are not.  it really hurts my feelings.  did i say something wrong or what?  i just dont understand.  he calls people and bugs them about hanging out with them and wanting to leave the house.  all the time.  but then sometimes he is really nice to me.  so what is it?  it tolerance i guess.  it sucks.  i dont like that.  but he is my "x."  so oh well. "x" the all knowing symbol for "who knows what the fuck!"

      if a company owns quite a number of strip joints and decides to open and "upscale bar and grille," having hostess, bartenders,bouncers, rent-a-cops,waitresses, and bathroom attendents- it does not mean it is not an outlit for ho-ing.  though the managment insist that you will only wait tables, and that they did not have time to update the contract in your paperwork that call you an "entertainer" and cleary states "no prostitution in sections"- it is still a ho job.   Clue1- all the waitresses are fairly hot with big boobs, though with a skank look to them. Clue2-discussion of harrassment, rapes, etc. last for over 30mins. Clue3-the bartender slaps his "package" on the bar to earn $50. Clue4-the 19 yr old waitress is frenching a 60 yr old man Clue5-you get offered $100 to go out back and have sex with mullet man Clue6-drinking is allowed on the clock only for "certain girls" age does not matter. Clue7-the bouncers really dont kick anyone out for fondling waitresses Clue8-management tells you to be more "entertaining!" screw serving them their food. Clue9-the other waitresses start saying that you think that you are too good to kiss that old guy, too good to grab his package, too good to let that guy nibble on your nips, too prude-ish to waittables.  Clue10-the waitresses leave with over $300 on a shitty night and are riding in the back of some mullet guy's car to earn another $100. Dont be fooled by false advertising of companies.  Once a ho house always a ho house.  You will get use to "entertaining the customer" or else not be scheduled.  Who cares if your customers were satisfied with witty conversation, eating food, fondling, and drinking.  It is not that simple.  It is a trap...  the money is so good.  The competition amoung girls makes having sex w/ customers seem like nothing.  No one cares about your food sales, drink sales, high % of tips- it is about the business.  I am not "too good" to do a waitressing job.  I am too good to stick my tongue down a grandpa's throat to earn an extra $20.

      think your yuppie job is secure? ha.  in this dog eat dog world people will stoop to the lowest pathetic level to get you out of the game, so they can profit.  even the snobs will pull some high school shit out of their ass.   example: i worked at a furniture/ home design studio catered to the obnoxiously rich.  very good pay for being a "fill-in as needed" answer phone and look cute position.  i get called one morning to not come in, they dont need me.  next thing i know they are calling my "emergency contact" to inform him that i am late to work.  shit hits the fan of course.  i try to call but get blown off by the receptionist.  i finally get ahold of someone and get blaimed for not coming into work.  "we dont know who called you and said such things!  we would not do that.  you were suppose to be here.  you are on probation and will be written up."  well, after much debate.  and managment finally checkin their call logs on the front desk phone it turn out someone did make a call to my number that morning.  no one is pointing fingers.  i still get blamed.  only two people were their that early.  the receptionist and one of the designers.  of course the receptionist is make a good chunk more than i am and has said that she does not want me taking her hours.  it is not hard to put two and two together.  however, even after writing the store manager twice, she still wins.  she has connections, is a yup. herself, and is not guilty till proven (caught in the act).  so i will still get written up for not being at work.  of course i said fuck this trifling yuppie shit and quit.  granted that this can happen anywhere, i just didnt think that it would happen where people considered themselves above shit like that.

      "borrowing" a registration sticker for your vehicle can land you in jail.  playing innocent and naive will keep your ass outta jail.

      just because you talk to someone online for 3 weeks straight, seen them on cam, and stay up late talking on the phone does not mean they have the right to say certain things:   1.  "i love your voice" how sweet... sure. 2.  "i think about you all day" umm....o..kay? 3.  "you're beautiful"  okay... whatever i can deal with that. 4.  "you've changed my life" another whatever... and yet kinda freaky. 5.  "i lurb you"  huh... what the fuck does that mean? 6.  "i love you"  oh shit... why does this always happen to me? 7.  "i want you here..." fuck... not another stalker! 8.  repeat number 3 and number 6 a lot. 9.  add more of number 4. 10.  top it all off with another number 7.  poor me.  i just dont know how this shit happens.  i dont know what i do.  i am chatting for gods sake.  yea, there is a few pictures of me... but still.  how can people go from so cool...to so... eerie.  what the fuck.  now what!

      the reason people meet other people online: it goes back to the basic attempts of knowing someone through talking and personailty.  well, also you can see their picture or web  cam and ignore them if you want.  it really takes the hassle out of leaving the house and getting rejected in person.  sort-a sad really. now for me... i get to reject people all the time.  it gets annoying to hear how "hot" you are and how you need to come to where ever they are at and do nasty things... etc... ha.   so in real life and online everyone wants a fuck.  sigh. can't escape it. at least people tend to listen to what you have to say moreso online than offline... yea...

      improvisation is the jazz of theatre. hearing about the funeral is almost like being there. it is still very sad. i think i wish i was there... i could have had a peace of mind then. said goodbye. now i am left wondering... going through the motions.... improvising...      family is all you will have in the long run.    live each day like it is your last  you never know...
