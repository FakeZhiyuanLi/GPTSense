      Just, y'know, so I could say I work at the Quikie Mart. Not that I think it's a great career choice or anything, it'd just be cool, someone says,  "I'm an industrial engineer"   And then you say "Oh, that's great, I work at the Quikie Mart for $6.50 an hour, I used to only make minimum wage, but I've been workin' for quite a while now. The boss says I could even get up to $7.00 if I work on my catfood displaying skills.."   The look un their face...priceless no?

      Lindsey recently posted this to her journal...thing. "I think, day by day, life gets progessively worse. And sometimes I wonder, "Y'know...maybe it's just the little depression stage all teenagers get...It's not my fault I'm so fucked up..." But what if it is my fault? I think I drive people away so I can be alone. I don't mean to. I don't WANT to; who likes to be alone? I don't know...It is so hard to live when you feel completely isolated. I can't think of anyone I know that feels like this...Maybe I do and they just didn't care enough to say anything. Right now, I think the only thing that keeps me from "giving in" would be Adi. It sounds weird, I know. My life depending on someone who lives hundreds of miles away. But I think, no, I know, she's the only person I told everything. My bestest friend, and I promised her that we'd meet up and get drunk together, have a hella fun time. I don't want to break my promise, but if shit doesn't improve, what can I do?" Yeah, there's more after that, but this is the part about ME, damnit. Now that my bout of selfishness is over...I must say... .....I love you too Lindzeh. I am so looking forward to holding eachother's hair up whilst we barf up everything we've eaten from the past decade. Or something like that.

      You don't want to hear me sing. Trust me. Heather nearly dies at the sound of me lalaing. Anyway, on with what I'd intended to talk about. Today, I had a rather good day. Got up around 6 pm, talked to Simon without fighting, had steak. All around fulfilling day.  I can't wait until I have money. I have soo many albums I want to buy: Franz Ferdinand Incubus-A Crow Left of the Murder Avril Lavigne-Under My Skin Blink-182...I don't really know the name, it's the one with Down on it.  So yeah, tha's about it for now.

      I've considered everything, and right now the only thing that seems acheivable is crying... That friend, the one that put me on ignore, I got on a friend of mine's e-mail and sent him a message, here was his reply:  Tha's low...tricking me into reading an email from you..well I was gonna take you off ignore today..but I don't think I will. Hope you're having as much fun as I am. toodles...  He's..having fun..without me... I screw up everything, I really do. I don't want or deserve to walk this earth anymore.

       urlLink Learn How to do Self-Hypnosis  Hot damn! I do a google to find the calories in an orange, and this is what comes up! Well...a site with a link to a site with a link to this site, anyway. The audio part of it I thought was a bunch of crap, but that spinny wheel was one hell of an acid trip....quite a treat if you're not epileptic.

      Well that's fine and dandy for the bird, but I have bigger problems. My best friend has me on ignore (on yahoo). It is, mostly, my fault. But it's also his because he just didn't  get it.  Then again, I'm not entirely sure what it was I wanted him to get. Perhaps it's for the best...but in the meantime...I'm bored and I miss my monkey...

      I had intended to not go to sleep until tonight..but I poo'd out around 9:30 a.m. or so. I did manage to drag myself out of bed seven hours later. I am still so tired...  In spite of the lack of sleep, I am in a rather good mood. Don't really know why...maybe it's my new bras...hmm...

      Apparently, dyeing your hair does not lessen the effects of blondeness. Around eight yesterday evening, I drank two cans of doubleshot. I still haven't been to bed. I'm waiting for mum to go to work so I can go take a shower. Unfortunately, that's in two hours.  Ah well, my nocturnalization was bound to happen sometime, and at least now it happened quite gradually, unlike last summer's excursions. Besides to take a shower I will stay couped up in my room, for fear of bad TV infomercials. Best,  Adi with the bags under her eyes.

      So, being in an extremely good mood today, I have made myself some iced coffee. It is quite good, and I've found coldness makes my lips look bigger (yay).   Also, I have put the first mood postit of the summer. It reads: be nice. I had one on the other computer too, but it said lighten up. Surprisingly, the postits tend to work. ...I really need a life...

      So, I got up about five seconds ago and I've already been hit with bad news. My friend failed two very important exams. Granted, it doesn't really, y'know, affect me, but it's still bad news.  In other news, I have $40 in my wallet just BEGGING to be spent...but at least half is going to be going towards new speakers. Woe is me. I need some new reading material, badly. I've read White Oleander (amazing book might I add) at least three times now. Gah, I need a life.

      There are nine things very wrong with my life:(in no particular order) 1.I have my grandmother's nose. 2.I am fat, but not fat fat, just annoyingly plump. 3.I become easily obsessed. 4.I live in a town named for an animal whose name happens to be slang for the female genitalia. 5.I was once known as Meatloaf. 6.I have a cat whose favorite food is headphones. 7.I cannot abide said cat seeing me naked. 8.I have had a four month case of writer's block. 9.I will live in a box because of number seven.

       Hi people. Last night I had the freakiest dream ever it was too weird for words. Did anyone ever see that movie the exocist? Well I had this dream that I lived in the house with the girl from that and the devil kept trying to get her so her mother had to rush her out of the house and she had to go in the sewer to try to be safe from him haha. My older sister lived in the house with me and we were scared that the devil was going to try to get us so we kept staying in rooms together. She was getting ready for bed and I had to follow her all around the house so I wouldn't be alone so the devil couldn't get me or her. I dragged all my stuffed animals around like a little kid too haha.&nbsp;It was scary cuz everything was all dark and we both kept randomly hearing growling noises haha. What a weird mind I haveeee.   Then I had another dream that it was my ex boyfriend's birthday party and me and Erin were invited and we went and ignored him the whole time and didn't get him a present and fucked around with other people there. How do I have a dream about satan and then a birthday party ignoring someone? Blehness.   Then I woke up&nbsp;of course and was up at 6:30 in the morning&nbsp;=(&nbsp;   Congrats on sleeping pattern&nbsp;Adi =D   Bai&nbsp;

I really not mean, his big girlfriend with big boobs jumped on me the other day&nbsp;at the carnival =( I didn't do a thing either. Boys suck, we need more men in the world. *nods*    &nbsp;  Sorry you had to get shots =( I don't like them either.

       Hi peoples,      I went to my Merri's bday party, slept over her house and saw the village and then the next day went to her block party. *cough/sneeze/coughcough* I was sick the whole time with my bad cold and kept taking medicine every 4 hours can't be good. *coughcough* I ate ice cream cake and smeared it over my face and at the block party i face painted little kids and they were oh so cute and this one girl took my hand and showed me something and told me she wanted me to paint her as a donkey but then i said i couldn't do that so she said i could do a panda on her and then the girl after her said she wanted to be just like me cuz erin painted my face as a kitty so we painted her as a kitty aw they were so cute. Eric was there and he was fucking annoying like last time so I gave his brother a water balloon and had him hit him with it for me it was cool. Me and merri and everyone had a huge water balloon/italian ice fight and i got covered and soaking wet. I was kidding around and I put a water balloon down my shirt and said i had a third boob and then it popped right in my shirt. I was drencheddd. *sneezesneezecoughhh* x.x bleh I got sunburned a little cuz i didn't put on sunscreen boohoo. oh well it doesn't hurt too bad. We played DDR at like 1 am and i'm very bad at it i kept getting E's on light mode and D's on easy. I suck and can't dance on arrows. oh well. The most fucking hilarious thing happened at the block party. These guys who were only one year older than me were wasteddd drunk and they got in the middle of the dance floor, took the microphone from the DJ, made him put on Backstreet boys "I want it that way" and started singing it at the top of their lungs. They were dancing sooo gay to it and we went over and watched them and we were on the ground laughing our asses off. It was so funny. Rory was at the block party and I don't really like her cuz she acts like a man and at one point she even put joey in a headlock he's only 10...that's stupid. I dealt with her though.      Simon why you always make posts about girls at work and stuff. Just wondering...   I surrounded by guys in school and none of them like me and everyone always tells me i'm pretty so i don't get it. I don't think it has anything to do with the way you look i think it's cuz your quiet and shy, i'm quiet and shy too. People just leave quiet people alone because they are intimidated by them. People would much rather be around a person who is loud and talks alot you know. You can't change your personality though just let things happen instead of wondering why cuz if you always wonder then you'll drive yourself insane. There isn't anything wrong with you you just haven't found right person yet who likes a quiet personality. Don't worry about it there are tons of girls in the world. *coughcoughxlikexmexcoughcoughsneeze* But you know like if that girl does like you then you should go for it you just have to find some confidence it doesn't have to be alot just a little...      *sighcougohcoughcoughcough!*      After Merri's block party i went to my cousin's grad party for 10 mins and i found out i have these cousins who are insane. This kid is like 7 and he kept grabbing my boobs and my sister's boobs and walking up to us and saying wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world and squealing really loudly. Ugg it was annoying he was cute though in his own weird way haha.      AHHH I CAN'T TAKE THIS SICKNESS ANYMORE! *crawls into bed and pulls covers over head*      bai people

      Well, if you want a serious answer, there are a number of possibilities. The way you carry yourself. You're just too shy. Or, more likely, it's that women do not generally look for a boyfriend at a clothes shop. Moving on, I know she's grounded, but I miss my Lindsey. And where is Laura? o.o Usually she's got about a million posts a day...tha's what she's here for, dernit. In conclusion I would just like to say that I am extremely bored, and will welcome any sort of entertainment, including naked photos of your pets. XD

       Today was interesting. I went to my friend merri's house and was tortured by 10 yr olds (aka merri's brother joey and his stupid friend eric).&nbsp;Eric screamed across the yard to his 14 yr old brother that i don't even know&nbsp;(staying at neighbor's house) that i was a hooker and would give him a dance in my underwear, also that i would show him my boobs and vagina. How lovely just about the whole neighborhood heard. So then I told Eric that i loved him&nbsp;to freak him out. He said sorry&nbsp;i don't feel the same way or some&nbsp;shit i really freaked him out it was awesome.&nbsp;To get them back even more&nbsp;for this me and merri made them popcorn and drenched it in hot sauce, but it backfired as they ate it and loved it. Actually they didn't even taste&nbsp;the hot stuff&nbsp;they thought it was blood but we told them it wasn't. uggg. So then I squirted the&nbsp;lovely being with water from the kitchen sink but that didn't do anything either. Then merri's mom left so we&nbsp;had to watch the assholes and they decided to be obnoxious and annoying. They took a stick from inside the house and tried to hit us with&nbsp;it so then i attempted to grab it from them and banged my hip into the wall ow ow ow hugeeee bruise.&nbsp;Then they followed us downstairs and started talking about their imaginary dragon named Leo that was going to eat us. Merri's&nbsp;mom also told them that they had to stay outside while she was gone so we were getting pretty pissed that they didn't listen. Then we locked them out of the house and went downstairs to play a game. They started ringing the doorbell 500000 times driving the dog insane and banging on the windows. So we're&nbsp;playing the game saying&nbsp;kay they will eventually stop and instead after a while we hear more pounding on windows and then a very loud crash. I screamed oh fuck and we looked at the window and it was smashed. Eric decided to geniously hit the window with a baseball bat to get our attention.&nbsp;Then he ran home. Joey was really upset and kept saying sorry a million times even though it wasn't all his fault and merri&nbsp;said she would tell their dad and take the blame for the whole thing. I told her she should tell her mom the truth though so then she did when she got home and her mom said she didn't want her taking the blame for it. So now everyone is hoping that the father doesn't see the window&nbsp;for about another week or joey won't get a birthday party and the block party on saturday will be cancelled. uggness what a productive day. Joey breaks things all the time with his friends and his parents are getting really pissed off about it. He needs to be more careful. His friends also need to not think about my boobs and call me a&nbsp;hooker haha. I normally love little kids but i seriously think after this experience if i have a son who is&nbsp;so bad that he doesn't know baseball bats&nbsp;smash windows and screams about&nbsp;vaginas to the neighborhood&nbsp;i will kill myself. &nbsp;   Simon your posts smell because they didn't post what you wrote! eeeep!&nbsp;I still don't know what a cat flap is. My Dad and Aunt sell stuff on ebay they are fucking obsessed. Go buy music shit and guitar&nbsp;bags from them people then you can&nbsp;get a package&nbsp;wrapped by me since i'm their personal slave.&nbsp;  P.S. I just made the 69th post in this blog =D i so proud

      I'm at Heather's, she's eating soup. She wanted me to post because the last three posts have been hers. We're going to see the notebook tonight. I fixed her webcam...well, sort of fixed, really I just turned it on. I also showed her how to burn a cd, but actually she didn't have any music to burn. So yeah, more fun than a barrel full of monkies here.

      I'm sitting in my pajamas and I look like shit. I'm not sure what that has to do with anything but it's something to talk about.  I have a hair appointment in an hour. I should really put some makeup on before I go. I don't think scaring old innocent ladies is a thing that I'm willing to do today. Tomorrow may be a good candidate for that though... Adi's coming over tonight.  OMG! I'm going to see the Notebook again tonight! I love Ryan Gossling. Must touch... *streches out arm* Neyeh. No use. So as i was saying before I so rudely interuppted myself...Adi is coming over tonight. Hopefully she will fix my webcam. It's starting to drive me crazy. Damn thing. I just want to throw it against the freaking wall! Calm down, Heather. *breathes* Ok. So now I have to go do my makeup and get ready for perfecting my oh so hopeless locks (which i personally really do love) by dying them blond. Well some of them. It's only hightlights. Not the whole shabang. I'm out.

Today I went to the ice cream place to see if the damn manager was in and there were these stupid spanish construction workers there and i asked if the manager was in and they said no and then this really obnoxious guy was like, "But I am" and all of them started laughing like HAHAHAHA HOLY FUCK I WANTED TO KICK HIM IN THE&nbsp; BALLS! I was already in a bad mood because my younger sister is so mean and I was looking forward to shopping with her and my aunt tomorrow and then my sister decided she didn't want me to come. I didn't even do anything to her she just said no i don't want laura there. Thanks. I'm so mad....  *breathes*

Whenever I go over there she talks about how sexy my legs are and then gives me tonssss of food. If she offers me a snack and I say okay then she gives me half a cake practically and I eat five bites and done with it and then feel bad x.x and if I say I'm not hungry then she gives me an entire cake almost!!! She insaneeee she also always calls my auntie and makes her&nbsp;be her slave and go to the store when it's way outta her way to get her stupid things. She smokes alot, can't drive, and can't breathe. I guess she pretty nice though she just weird. She really fat and&nbsp;a while ago I saw a piccie of her from when she was 20 and she was stick skinny and really really pretty so I said something like, "Wow grandma used to be alot skinnier than she is now"&nbsp;to my aunt and&nbsp;my grandma was in the room eeeeeeep. I so stupid.&nbsp;She just&nbsp;laughed though and said I was&nbsp;a "cheeky wee monkey" hehe old people's insults are funny.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Today I went to price club and my aunt actually bought food that didn't have fat and grease as the main ingredient. Yay because if I have to eat fast food for dinner one more night in a row I&nbsp;am gonna puke.

      I've been gone all afternoon spending quality time with my grandma. That would be great, except for she considers quality time to be shopping at save-a-lot, which tends to attract retarded, disabled, maimed, and otherwise unsightly people. To try and speed things up, I&nbsp;offered to go ahead and get certain things, but she was like "No, there's specific&nbsp;kinda I need...and you know how your grandpa is.." And THEN, in the meed section,&nbsp;she holds this..this...THING, in my face...and I didn't get a very&nbsp;good look at it, but I thought it was a penis...turned out it was a pigs foot > ....... ....... Our endeavors were unsuccessful.&nbsp;  So we went to ANOTHER hardware store, where she argued in a very loud way&nbsp;with a very hot hardware-store guy (I LOVE the guys that work in hardware stores..they're so manly...besides the old thick-glasses guy anyway) about the weed b gone...When she walked away I whispered "Forgive her, she's old.." He smiled, buh that was all. Have I mentioned I realleh dun look my best today either? I've lost weight and don't have any clothes that fit..and my hair was wet..and it was humid out so the usually lovely locks went insane...so yeah, definitely no boyscouting today.

Just let go and take yourself out before I kill you too. Aren't you tired of fucking me over and over? You were the last person I wanted in my sights. And my heart honestly breaks when I think of you. I understand now what I love you means- It's doing the right thing no matter the consequence. I'm tying you up, using the nicest lace, trying to kill you softly. Trying to erase your face. I'd redecorate the walls with your inner thoughts, but I'm afraid it's the wrong shade of red. But I have these sadistic urges and I don't want to take it out on you. Right now you're the only one who understands my plight. Right now you're the only reason I can't sleep through the night.    &nbsp;  -sniffles- ;-; I need a guy or something.

       ..How am I taking out the fun? ...Cuz I don't feel threatened by someone sitting on his lap? I don't need to prove anything I trust him and he respects me =)      I'm so tired and people are slamming doors in this house and fighting bleh. This girl who i used to be best friends with in february but then we didn't talk for a while and now we're friends again, her boyfriend broke up with her and she's really upset. So this morning i talked to her and i was on my way to the beach so i said i'd talk to her tonight and i promised to be online and everything and i said maybe i'd call her if my aunt wasn't hoging phone and all this other stuff. So I was so fucking tired tonight and i wanted to go to bed so badly but i left aim on and forced myself to stay awake just so i could talk to her and i waited for her to get back from work and everything like i said i would just so we could talk so it gets to be like 10 and then she comes online and puts an away message on "I don't want to talk to anyone." People so selfish sometimes. I was falling asleep on my bed waiting for her and I was so tired and all i wanted to do was sleep but i somehow stayed awake and then she goes and does that. It's so stupid. I'm always giving my whole life to other people and then i don't get same back. I would die for anyone that i care about and i just feel alot of the time they wouldn't do same for me. oh well. the end.       Today was really fun but tiring we made a huge hole in the sand and buried merri's little brother joey in it and then shaped him like a mermaid. He is becoming a huge pervert when we were making his boobs up he was like "BUILD THEM UP TO HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!" lmao. I got annoying white jellyfish and sand all over my ass and legs it was great. We made joey's boobs so big that little kids were coming over to see what we were doing and their parents were turning them away. Joey was all over me and erin too hugging us and kissing our hands lmao. Then in the car joey decided to tell me who he liked and he whispered in my ear that he liked this girl emily and i said a little too loudly "Emily what? Corbet?" or something like that and merri and his mom heard so he got really pissed at me cuz he immature 10 yr old of course and he wouldn't talk to me and told me i wasn't his friend anymore lol. Then he started pinching me 20 times, he gave me "sunburn" on my arm which is like when you twist the person's skin it's so painful and i was screaming it hurt so bad, he threw this ball at my back, he said tonsss of things that i won't repeat, and he was being an obnoxious brat -_-. I said I was sorry like 5000000 times and felt really bad but he just kept doing more mean stuff. So then he told me that the only way i could make it up to him was to give a strip show on a soccer field in front of everyone and HE had to be there or date his friend eric who broke a window. I said i wasn't doing either. Then he said that to make it up to him i could scream at the men outside that i thought they were sexy so i did that and i screamed "I THINK YOU'RE SEXY" at tons of guys from the car when we passed them. Then he decided that i skipped some men so he still wouldn't forgive me -_-. Later on his mom told me that joey probably made up that name and that she wasn't even a real girl and he was just doing all that stuff to make me feel really bad. Joey said she was a real girl and I hurt his feelings and all this other stuff ugggg. I bet she really is a pretend girl and he did all that stuff to me for no reason lol. So now he's mad at me but he'll probably forget all about it in a few days cuz he's a weird kid. I'm 17 and shouldn't care about a dumb 10 yr old but I just feel bad because i don't like to make people mad or feel bad or anything even if it is a 10 yr old. whatever.       K now i'm talking to that girl and trying to help her and i feel like a moron cuz i can't.      baiii people this was a long post    P.S. I wrote this last night and put it in the blog but the blog fucked it up so i had to copy it and put it in now...

      I had to delete one of Simon's posts, because for some reason it was screwing up the template, making all the links and archives and such go down to the bottom.  In case you're wondering, it was the catflap one.
