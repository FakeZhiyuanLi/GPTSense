      Canada was, well, AWESOME!!  Amazing!  And did I mention, Awesome!?  Well, it all began with a 15 hour van ride that included a long delay at the border, that resulted in our group to be pretty late to the campus.  We then got our track groups, and I ended up with woking with children (oh joy).  Our track got to run a VBS that did Rickshaw Rally (oh bigger joy) at a Salvation Army Church in the, as the Salvation Army leader said, "projects" or "ghetto" of Kingston.  So I'm thinkin, "Great."  But, it turned out to be good.  The kids were great, and apart from our track leader splitting her head open on the bus' back door and bleeding all over herself, nothing really bad happened.  The services were awesome, the dorm rooms were beyond awesome, pretty much everything was awesome.  Well, I've rambled on for enough now, leave some comments.    P.S, "Ne Na Kulu Murasula, la Yasua"  P.P.S, Greg: "Pico Nala Mufasa"

      I, Robot was an awesome movie.  Excellent action, excellent plot,  and for once, pretty good acting.  All in one movie.   Amazing.  Some excellent one-liners too.  If you have the  time, GO SEE IT!!         - "Ahhhh, CHOO!!   Oh, I'm sorry, I'm allergic to bullsh*t."

      If anyone could offer me help with XML and CSS, and how to convert them to HTML, it would be very appreciated!  I get most of it, but if you know alot about them, it would be nice to have a source of knowledge.

      Finally!!  After a month, we finally sold our house!  So now, we can move to the house we want in Jolliff Woods, on Barn Swallow, umm road? drive? circle? *doesn't know*. :)  I don't know the number either, but w/e.  Moving will be interesting, will prolly happen in a coupl'a weeks.  I gotta redo the home network, run wires through the attic and walls and everything, a good day's job.  Anyway, less noise, less car and foot traffic, and less light.  YAY I'm happy!

      I just bought a Wireless NIC on Wed., and now I will be doing some wardriving.  Did some last night, and found a few.   However, I did some more wardriving today and WOW!  I went into Miars Plantation (expensive neighborhood) and my count jumped hugely!!  A couple used WEP, but most didn't.  Anyway, if you have a laptop and WNIC, or if you would just like to join the fun, contact me.  OH!! If you have a GPS receiver that plugs into a comp's serial port, can I borrow it? Please!?!?
