      My mom was so depressed yesterday because the insurance didn't really cover her jewerlry costs. She won't even check out pawn shops because she's decided she doesn't want the stuff back. There were really only three pieces that mattered: her mom's amithyst ring, her sister's ruby ring and her grandmother's camio. Valueable, yes, but more sentimental.     L and I saw the 'Home at the End of the World.' Interesting flick. A few people walked about at the first "gay" scene. Really it wasn't that visibly sexual but a lot of implied. Colin Farrel did an amazing acting job and I almost always like Sissy Spacek. It starts in 1967 and this nine-year-old kid adores his pot-smoking, crystal-meth-taking brother. His brother has a bad-ending but in a sad and expected way, and the kid sees it. Eventually his parents die, and as a teenager he lives with his best-friend's family. He grows up into this very pure-hearted type of person. It was a vignette of a period in his life, without an obvious point or conclusion. At least, L and I haven't figured it out yet.    It was a fun evening ending in ice cream and good thing to do since I still can't go to TKD.    Oh, for my "bachelorette" party, we are going to watch season one of Wonder Woman and take a sip of our bailey's and coffee every time she spins. :-)  Kelly wanted to throw me a more traditional party but I am too old for that. She thinks I am a big dork and won't come to the WW party. Her loss. I think it will just be L and the bridesmaids.

      Really fucked up my foot and knee yesterday at TKD. Not sure how long it will take to heal up but I hope not too long. Debated using crutches but they are more trouble than they're worth.    We are probably going to see the Home at the End of the World tomorrow night. An artsy film with Colin Farrell. Should be good.

       Yesterday, as we were driving to Lowes, a stray dog came running out on to Beaconsfield. He came in front of my car, so I stopped and hit my blinkers. I honked to scare him off, but it didn't faze him. So I openned my car door and he jumped in.     We pulled into the house he just walked by, but the owner hadn't seen him before. So we took him to my parent's house and tied him up out back. We called him Stray Dog and he turned out to be the best stray dog ever.     He was so ugly he was cute, and all slobbery but that was ok too (not foamy, just slobbery). He was still a puppy and very playful. On the down side he was definitely part pit-bull. They have such a bad reputation. We taught him to sit and lay down in the afternoon.      Mom and I were very taken with Stray Dog but I think Dad and Paul were less enthused.         Anyway, animal protection picked up Stray Dog today and they hold him for 5 days before turning him over to the humane society or some equivalent. He is so friendly I am sure someone is looking for him. Wish I could keep him but I have a dog and two cats already.

      So my parents house was broken into yesterday and robbed. The thieves took pretty much everything ...DVD, computer, jewelry, but not furniture etc. I get pretty angry when it comes to thieves because you work hard to have nice things so that someone who calls it "going to work" takes it, pawns it and calls it a good day.  On the up-side, this thief wasn't overly malicious. He didn't smash things for no reason, and he didn't hurt the dog ( a little white puff ball).  At least I understand the thief who steals for money. I don't get the vandalizing kind at all. Those guys are bastards.

      How is it that a person can actually control the moods of those around him (her) just by offering or withholding a smile or hello or quick conversation? Is it that the energy around them is so great that others are natually drawn to and affected by them? That is such power!

      I would like to figure out my spirit animal but haven't had time to sit down and do it. Very dissappointing because it is things like 'cleaning house' that are taking up time. Oh well.  I have been jotting down my premonition moments things like driving along and I think there's a cop ahead, or there are donuts in the breakroom. I am about 75% accurate so far. These times are like an idea pops in my head out of nowhere so strongly that I know it's right.  I am taking Friday off to go hiking in Canada - should be quite wonderful and I hope the weather stays nice for it.

      Having some good conversations about Divinations and all things Wicca/TKD (my two favorite topics!) with a UK native.  Trying to fit it all in between work and people coming into the office. It's neat when you can connect with someone so far away.  He gave me a list of things to understand some of the things I see when scrying so I am anxious to get home and try it out again.  I am moving back to the other house soon - and am not really looking forward to it. I have a pattern set down at the house I am trying to sell and I will miss it. I have plenty of time in the evenings for doing me-things, and that won't be the case when I move back.  :-( Oh well, not much else to say.

      My future mother-in-law is spending a week with me at my house. Mostly it has been pretty easy. She is trying to be good about letting me get about my business. I do miss spending time at the other house now though. L and I chatted on the phone for quite a while - it was a nice reprieve from chatting with my FMIL only. And Paul comes over to spend the evenings. It works out.  I am spending too much time on the forums lately. They are very interesting though and I enjoy reading them. My foot, ankle and knee are a bit closer to getting better. I am almost walking normally now. I can't wait to get back to TKD. I miss it. I will probably miss testing this month though, because of the injury.  I don't have much to talk about but felt I should keep my log up. L got a G5 with a 23" flatscreen monitor - very nice.

      woof woof woof - I mean,  OMG I went to the Pinery on Friday!!!!!!! My owner rocks....It was a long time in the cage because the security at the bridge sucked, so I barked at the gaurd when he asked our citizenship. He was fearful of my ferociousness because he let us through then.  I walked around the beach and even went in the water...the smells were sooooooo good.  I made friends with a little pomeranian there...very nice pup. Monte blew me off a little at the beach, but I'm not offended. He likes the waves way more than me.  After that my owner tied me up so I barked a lot. They ate lunch and I tried to get some, but she is tricky that way...putting her food on the table and not letting me up. We walked two cool paths and ran into a bunch of people. I barked some at a German lady - she understood I was just doing my job. Actually it was her son I was barking at - he looked a little shady. And I tried to chase a jogger. He kept looping around and passing us so I figured it was a challenge. My owner tightened up my leash though.  After we got back, Monte and I were buds in the back yard. Then I drooled and shed a bunch in the kitchen - hehe.  I am pretty tired today though. All wore out. My owners played with me all weekend so I didn't have a chance to nap.

      Mmmm - today was ok. I ran around the kitchen some and sniffed some stuff. The other day though, I could have killed my owners. The she-one comes down and starts opening all sorts of good smelling stuff - not the least of which was beef! She put it in a bowl and left as usual. Then the most wonderful smelling stuff came from the bowl. All day I was driven insane but good smelling beef. ALL DAY!!! I jumped up a lot but couldn't reach the bowl.  When they came home they didn't apologize or even share. But I wagged my tail and ran around because I forgot to be mad at them.
