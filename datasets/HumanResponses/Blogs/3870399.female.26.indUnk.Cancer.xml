      While my husband is laying comfy in our bed I went to a&nbsp; board that he frequents a lot.&nbsp; As I was looking for some threads to post in I found a couple of disturbing ones that he had posted in.&nbsp; Needless to say, I don't feel very wifely or womanly after seeing what he had posted.&nbsp; I actually cried.&nbsp; It makes me feel like he doesn't want me anymore even though I know that is not the case.&nbsp; I just can't believe that he posted it and all that crap.&nbsp; I don't know what to do or feel right now. I don't know whether to be angery or ball my eyes out.

      The other day Jay and I went with a few of his friends to celebrate our birthdays.  Some of us had fun at On the Border.  Then we went to see Anchorman.  About the only part of the movie that I liked was the soundtrack.  My husband doesn't understand my sense of humor.  Yes of course there were parts of the movie that were funny, but other than that I didn't like it that much.  I am just not that big of Will Ferrell fan.  Big woop on seeing him chest exposed.  It looks like he permed his chest hair to get it that curly.  I would have rather seen the Terminal or Chronicles of Riddick. Ohhh Well.  A girl can dream.

      Today Jay and I went and looked at a few houses.  The one I liked the most was temporarily taken off the market, but anyway.  We found 2 more that had potential in them.  In the mean time we are still on the look out for the right house.  I am now free of paying off my car because today I made the final payment.  YEAH!!! YEAH!! YEAH!! It is about time, 5 years seems to long.  Anyway, it is raining right now and I am on the last chapter of my book.  Can't wait to finish it to start on my other 2.  Until the next post.

      It is around 2:00 a.m. and I am just sitting here on the couch with my dog, who is asleep, watching a little Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Debating on whether to go to sleep or shoot off a firecracker or 2.  Haven't decided on what to do.  Husband is at work and we need to decide on a house to buy.  Decisions and so many other things to do...
