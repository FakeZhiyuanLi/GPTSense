       i've been working through a great devotional book called  devotional classics  (edited by Foster & Smith, published by Harper-Collins for Renovare'). this book takes you through aspects of your spiritual life through the eyes and experiences of other notable christians who have lived and written. the first entry is by c.s. lewis and includes a brief excerpt from his book  mere christianity . what he writes directly coincides with the series i'm doing on sundays (Jesus &amp; ____? a study of hebrews). the great question is: have we abandoned all of our life to Jesus, or are we trying to have Jesus & something else? here's the quote that has stuck with me:              "The terrible thing, the almost impossible thing, is to hand over your whole self--all your wishes and precautions-to Christ. But it is far easier than what we are trying to do instead. For what we are trying to do is to remain what we call 'ourselves,' to keep personal happiness as our great aim in life, and yet at the same time 'be good.' we are all trying to let our mind and heart go their own way--centered on money or pleasure or ambition--and hoping in spite of this to behave honestly and chastely and humbly."       Jesus talks about this in Luke 14:25-33 when he talks about the cost of being a disciple. he says that you can't be his disciple unless your commitment to him is so absolute that you're willing to "hate" your family or even your "own life." no other prioirity or value in life can be close to the overwhelming desire to know him and follow him. he gives a couple of examples (a man who wants to build a tower who first figures out whether he has enough resources to complete it, or a king who calculates his strength before going into battle with an enemy to ensure that he can win) to illustrate that it is idiotic to start to try to follow him if you don't recognize this inherent cost of being willing to let go of everything else.       how many of us really feel like we've done that? how many of us can look around at our lives, and say, "yeah, i've set everything else aside to pursue him, to follow his lead in my life." as i look around at my own life--the way i prioiritize, what i value based on how i use my time and money, the attitudes i have toward other people, etc.--i have to admit that it looks like there are quite a few things i want to add to Jesus &amp; _____. that bothers me. how about you?   God, help me to (a) see the things i'm holding onto and (b) be wiling to let them go.

      most of us live our spiritual lives very much in isolation.  you may have lots of friends . . . you may go to church each week . . . you may be involved in an in-depth Bible study . . . perhaps you're in a small group. regardless, you and i live much of our spiritual life internally, as we think and feel and will. and most of us are unwilling, or too afraid, to share what is actually going on inside.  i don't think that's good for us. i don't think that that is how you live spiritually. i think that it is only at the point when you have become so broken that you're not afraid to admit the inner reality because you know that God has accepted and loved you anyway that you really begin to live the new life He has given. i believe that the evidence of having died to ourself is that we begin to be able to live openly and experience what an authentic community is.  that is why i am writing this blog. i have friends, i go to church each week (i'm a pastor--i have to!), i study the Bible with a number of people, and i have a great small group with people that i really like. and yet, i often feel very isolated, very alone. i want to change that. maybe putting my daily experience and spiritual life will help.
