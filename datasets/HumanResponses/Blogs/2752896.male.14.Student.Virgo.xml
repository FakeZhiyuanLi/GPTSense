      Went to Wonderland for the first time in 5 years yesterday! W00t! GREAT fun! Spent the entire day there. God the food was expensive.  Went on: -Tomb Raider (They wouldn't let my on with my glasses, ergo, I was blind) -SpongeBob Squarepants 3D (Disgusting Pickle Allergic Fish) -Psyclone (Greatest view of Wonderland) -SledgeHammer (People threw up all over the place after this ride) -CliffHanger (Tis where I think I lost my cellphone) -The Bat (The best ride yet!) -Dropzone ("Oh My Fucking God!!! Oh, it's over already?!") -SkyRider (Tis where I discovered I lost my cellphone) -The Fly (Keep your hands up for this ride!) -Top Gun (GREAT starter!) -Vortex (Do this when twiddling your thumbs!) -Dragonfire (This was boring, and painful) -Wild Beast (Your arms have to go up for this one too!)  13 rides in 10 hours!!! W00T!!! ----- Lost my cellphone somewhere in the park. Not good, still waiting for the call from the park, but it was most likely dropped in the water, so it will be useless anyway :( O well. Now i get a new phone! and they're taking the money from my allowance to pay for the phone =( ----- They just phoned me 5 minutes ago, telling me they found my phone!  YEAH! Only, it might/most likely will be useless anyway  Leave a Comment Dammit!

      Summertime..... and the living is easy.... AND IT IS!  As a tradition, my family and a few others gathered together and went on a road trip. The road trip consisted of: -4 days, 3 nights. -20 hours in the car (total) -4 annoying little kids -my best friend -lots of fun and sunshine.  We went to 'Frankenmuth', which was a retarded town, imitating Germany. We thought we were up for a real treat when the restaurants said: "WORLD FAMOUS CHICKEN, GERMAN STYLE" Boy, were we wrong! It was nothing better than KFC. in other words... SUCKED CRAP!  Next day, spent 3 hours in a car, to get to the edge of Lake Michigan, to ride a ferry to an island called 'Macinac Island'. It was pretty boring, and spelled like horse poo. The island had great history though. As a matter of fact, the only reason the island smelt like horse poo, was because the island banned cars. They have bridges and stuff, but the people who actually live on the island do not own cars. They probably own many many many horses. The population of the town is very small; their school (the one and ONLY school on the island) has a graduating class of 2 -10 every year.... haha. The only other special thing about the island, was that the "GRAND HOTEL" was located on that island, was the set of a famous movie called "Somewhere in Time", dated like 1986... and the Grand Hotel is HUGE. It has a porch that stretches all across the length of the Hotel, which is about 2 football fields long... crazy... and it costs a lot to stay there. The cheapest room, at about $200/night, would get you a window. At the other end of the scale, for $3000/night, would get you a personal chef, waiter, messeus (dunno how you spell it) and a whole bunch of ther GRAND stuff. And to step into the foyer of the hotel during the day would cost you $10/person.  Day after that, rode 5 hours in the car to Sudbury. Dirty Dirty Sudbury. Had another history lesson about the big nickel mines. that was pretty boring. i'll cut you the crap. slept the night at sudbury, and went to their&nbsp;apparently really well known science center. I say apparently, because that's what others have told me. I have a completely different opinion. In short, it was pretty bad compared to the other ones i've been to.  The ride home was another 5 hours in the car, and slept for three hours of the ride. after the three hours, played cards with my best friend for two hours.. that's basically my trip.   yes... quite boring... i can only hope that ottawa (which i am going to visit sometime in august) can be better.  &nbsp; Leave a Comment Dammit!

      Oh man... summer is here, and i haven't done much that's interesting since i came back from camping last weekend, i've only been cleaning up the tents and what not.... so much to clean. The worst part is, they all smell like bug repellent =S (note: next door, my sister is singing Barbie Girl.... yes that's how bored i am) went to chrystal's yesterday. Had&nbsp; a BLAST played video games all night long.... W00T! MARIO TENNIS!!!! and played MAHJONG!!! owned you all with my two wins in a row!!! hahah... and it wasn't much of a movie night btw, as it was supposed to be. we only watched bourne identity, which i only watched half, because i was playing  video&nbsp;games and&nbsp;mahjong most of the time. that was basically all of last night &nbsp; played golf today... driving range only lol, not good enough to be on the holes infact, i suck at golf a lot!!!:D hehe... i can only hit about 120, and that's on the rare  occasion when i don't miss =Ãž considering it's mi first time in about 4 years...  it's plenty good!!! ----- Leave a Comment Dammit!

      Haven't posted in a while.... cuz there was nothing interesting to post about. this time, i do! ERGO, i posted =D  Anyway, this wonderful post would be about my adventurous trek  (which was three hours in the car btw) and my lodgings (stinky stinky tents =P) at Rondeau Campgrounds, somewhere near windsor.  So. It was great! spent most of the time biking. Went on a speed bike for the first time. Very interesting On a speed bike, you have to keep ur body low, and near the handle bars, by hunching forward, and if you're going fast on a speed bike, the wind goes down your shirt.   It was REALLY REALLY hot by the way. Apparently, it was around 40 degrees. that's really hot. hotter than toast. heehee  so the heat got me to sweat. ALOT the sweat got the bugs. ALOT of bugs the bugs gave me lots of bites. ALOT of them too fun fun. had to shower like three times a day.  the second day was spent at the beach of lake erie.  the water was great. there were small waves, and the carried me to shower when i didn't feel like playing frizbee the sand was sooo warm. it was cozy. soaked a bit of the sun.  my tanline from my watch last year, has increased it's contrast with its surrounding skin.  after sitting in the sand when your wet, you have to get out and shower.  That's when i discovered there was sand in places where they shouldn't be.  disgusting. showered. lazed around for 5 hours. Ate. Lazed some more.  AHHHH. that's the life   Leave a Comment Dammit!
