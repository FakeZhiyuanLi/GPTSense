						   Unbelievably--the media has all but completely ignored this story.  For those of you that don't already know -- George W. Bush went AWOL during his "service" in the Texas Air National Guard.  At least, that's what the records say...  For FACTS about these allegations, read  urlLink this .

						   I'm sure many of you have wondered just whatever happened to Johnny Lawrence.  I've often pondered the eventual outcome of this aryan god we all remember so fondly from his career-defining turn in The Karate Kid.  This young man single-handedly essayed the popular 80's California Bully role.    From his climactic reign as Cobra Kai king to his eventual demise at the hands (and feet) of Daniel LaRusso to his little-known stint as a sex slave...click  urlLink here to read the complete Johnny Lawrence Story .    (Thanks to Patton Oswalt -- a very funny comedian)

						   So George W. has finally unveiled his campaign strategy for this years upcoming presidential election.  Supporters were both surprised and inspired by his moving statements regarding his plans for changes he's going to make in the Oval Office -- if elected president.

						   John Ashcroft -- defending the war in Iraq despite there being no weapons of mass destruction -- was recently  urlLink quoted  as saying the absence of physical weapon-related proof was irrelevant because Saddam Hussein (had he not been so heroically captured) might again resort to "evil chemistry and evil biology".  That's a real quote.  From your attorney general.  The same guy who believes some cats are also harbingers of the devil (also an actual statemtent).  The same guy who believes in ... The Devil.    Anyway, wondering where one goes to learn "Evil Chemistry" or "Evil Biology"?  Welcome to  urlLink Evil Communiversity !  Find out more about how you too can learn how be Truly Evil...

						   So -- for the sake of conclusion -- I sent my final reply:   Okay,   These are the last words I'm going to waste on this petty, narrow-minded and ultimately pointless argument. If I weren't so bored at work, I wouldn't even be writing this...   >>>Alex,  >>>  >>>I still don't know who you are, but in the course of this conversation I  >>>have heard from others much about you, from your defending socialism as a  >>>reasonably practical idea to being a classic liberal who will regurgitate  >>>anything told to him by 'progressive' thinkers. This is all proving true.  >>> But, for the sake of argument, I will rebutt you, in line.  >>>  >>>  >>>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Socialism--within its pure, unbiased, philosphical constructs--is a realm of thought worth exploring. It holds many great notions, most of which would be impractical in the world we're currently living in. However, I bear no shame in expressing my support of many of its ideals.   "Classic liberal"--what exactly, by definition, is that? I'm bearded, wearing a turtleneck and a smoking jacket, taking bong hits and looking for something to protest? No, my political beliefs are relatively simple. I believe in freedom and equality for all people, without regard to their race, sex, religion, sexual preference or economic status. I believe in peace for all. I beleive that those with the most should be compassionate towards those with the least--and reflect that compassion through selfless charity. I believe we should protect this fragile, expendible paradise we're so lucky to live in, lest we are destroyed or forced to move. These thoughts are my own, however I freely admit I've been moved by the words and thoughts of the great thinkers before me. As I would hope you have.   >>>-You referred to conservatives as hate filled, not the other way around,  >>>hardly a position you can take, even if you euphemize your ridiculous  >>>comments as "cynical humor." More like "bitter failure."   I referred to racists as hate filled. And, for the record, the author of that original e-mail (which you admit is based on weak facts and slanderous opinions) represented a racist "hate group". If you need me to define this term, let me know. My comments were originally directed towards him.   >>>-Ever heard of the Kennedy's? Did you think up this witty argument all by  >>>yourself? I never said you hate him, but, from what I hear, you hardly  >>>have the right to question his education and intelligence. From people  >>>that have and do work with W, yes, I do believe him to be an extremely  >>>intelligent, and sincere, person.   This is subjective. I think Bush is an incompetent puppet. You think he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. We could go on for days and niether could prove the other wrong. And I love your "subtle" jab at my own intelligence and education. Based on what knowledge? What your frat brothers say/think/don't really know. Fuck you. (ooh, i used a naughty word, must be cause i'm jess' so guddurn stoopid!)   >>>-As I said, I did none of this research. It was taken directly from an  >>>actually very liberal source that has done the research. The original  >>>email circulating is largely exaggerated. Everything I recited is fact.   As I said, my comments were initally directed towards the author of the original e-mail. If it makes you happy, I'm completely aware of the facts you stated in your e-mail and I'll admit the allegations made against Dr. King are undoubtedly SOMEWHAT true. However, the entire point of my argument is obviously completely lost on you. I'll explain more below...   >>>his name is meaningless.  >>>-But Bush's isn't? Nice double standard, hypocrite.   When you wrote this--comparing GW Bush to Martin Luther King, Jr.--did you have a straight face? Seriously, this is probably the most staggeringly DUMB comparison I've ever heard. Comparing these two men isn't even apples and oranges, its apples and...hunan chicken or something. I mean, if you really think that in 20-30 years, GW Bush is going to be known for anything other than his systematic destruction of the last 100 years of human progress, then you need a time machine my friend. Since that bozo's cronies stole his election, the economy crashed, we were sold a war with lies, "terrorism" is still orange, osama's still out there, our contitutional rights have been taken from us in such a way that our country has never known, environmental protection laws are being destroyed, nobody has jobs, and our children will live in a state of Dickensian poverty because our adminstrations spend like drunken sailors. Other than dressing up like a fighter pilot and serving some turkey, just what has your Ivy-league supergenius done? Right, he got Saddam. I know.   >>>his political affiliation is meaningless.  >>>-Communism is meaningless? Would you accept a Communist as our President?  >>> Communism is hardly an innocent 'political affiliation.'   Again, he never directly endorsed the Communist party. And I'm sorry, Senator McCarthy--but Communism is nothing more than a bad idea. It's not this evil scary monster just waiting to eat our babies. In fact, historically, "communist" was thrown about as an easy label to give those whom we feared and wanted to control. Different words are used today, much to the same effect.   >>>his academic record is meaningless.  >>>-But Bush's isn't? Nice double standard, hypocrite. I can only imagine  >>>if it were brought out that Bush had plagiarized any of his work in  >>>college. You refer to his education as part of his name, but you say  >>>MLK's academic record is meaningless. Very convenient. MLK's greatest  >>>speech is plagiarized. This is hardly meaningless.   Again, with the Bush/King comparisons. One more time, Martin Luther King championed the civil rights movement, George W. Bush is a proved incompetent whole stole an election and then proceeded to destroy the world. I don't know how you keep getting these mixed up...    >>>his sexual habits are meaningless.  >>>-Of course they are. Cheating on your wife while an ordained minister and  >>>religious leader is meaningless. Give me a break.   I don't believe in Christianity, so yes, to me this is meaningless. And please--save the Godless Heathen accusations. I already know.   >>>the change he brought to this country will forever overshadow any petty  >>>mudslinging perpetuated upon him by brainless automotons like yourself.  >>>-I assume you meant to sound smart by using the word 'automaton,' but  >>>that's only a guess. I do agree that the change he brought will  >>>overshadow his immorality, plagiarism, and links to Communism. But, they  >>>are undeniable, and that's all I'm saying.   Great. You make an excellent point. He wasn't perfect like Jesus. He should be desecrated and forgotten, his life is meaningless. Excellent brainwork.   >>>if you think the worth of a man's life can be added up and measured by  >>>only his mistakes, i have pity for the world, as we will all pass as  >>>failures.  >>>-Nice assumption.   Nice assumption? That's the best you can do? Its not an assumption, its the truth. Prove otherwise. Doesn't your religion (the same religion as Dr. King's, I might add) say "we're all sinners" or something like that?   >>>the original e-mail sent out purporting to state facts about MLK was  >>>generated by a hate group in hopes of stopping MLK day as a federal  >>>holiday. you can find this and more information at the following website:  >>>  >>>http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/mlklies.html  >>>-Fully aware of that, and I think it is a questionable cause at best.  >>>However, it is reasonable to protest this holiday, and the facts about MLK  >>>are plenty for any group to question it. I believe the symbolic value of  >>>the holiday outweighs the man himself, but surely you can see the point  >>>about questioning MLK's sainthood?   A questionable cause? They take chain-emails that are untrue and expose the lies, citing facts and sources. Why is that questionable? If you don't like that he has a holiday, just go to work or whatever and shut up. Did I say he was a saint? What is a saint?   >>>-Stating facts and quoting books are hardly inane comments. I simply  >>>thought you might like to know the facts of the matter... but apparently  >>>you're not willing to face them.   Thank you, kind sir, for exposing these shocking revelations to me. Martin Luther King wasn't a white republican who wasn't always honest and faithful to his wife. For the love of God, he wasn't even named Martin! God, I had NO IDEA! Thank you thank you. The world is SO much better for knowing these things! Who could imagine that OUR HISTORYBOOKS would put an untruthful slant on history like that! Good thing they got it right about everything else!   >>>i don't hate anyone, especially not based on trivialities such as the  >>>color of one's skin.  >>>-Honestly, I find that very hard to believe, but that's just my  >>>impression.   Your "impressions" are clearly and categorically ridiculous. Some advice: never trust them.   >>>our world is slowly moving in a direction of progressive peace and  >>>equality, whether people such as yourselves like it or not.  >>>-You are extremely prejudiced.   Against who? Morons? Okay, I admit it. I'm predjuced as fuck against know-nothing-but-think-they-know-it-all because they're too lazy to find out the truth when they can just keep shouting the self-serving lies MORONS.   >>>ignorance and blind hatred will be extinguished sooner or later and people  >>>like you will have little bearing on the outcome.  >>>-An amazing prejudice you bear based on a very simple stereotype.   What stereotype? I'm simply making judgements on the little I know about you...most of which is coming from your own pathetically small-minded statements.   >>>martin luther king, jr. was much more than a man. he was -- and is -- an  >>>idea. an idea of a world where "all men are created equal and will be  >>>judged not be the color of their skin, but by the content of their  >>>character".   apparently you had nothing to say about this one. i don't blame you. i wouldn't want to challenge the wisdom of one of the greatest American's we've had the privelidge to call a countryman.   >>>again, read "letter from a birmingham prison", THEN try and make your  >>>silly points....   Seriously, read the letter.   >>>-I agree that he is more than a man. I simply wanted you to know the  >>>facts about the man before referring to all who question him as 'idiot  >>>rednecks.' Freedom of speech is something I'm sure you hang your hat on,  >>>and there is nothing wrong with questioning a man, especially one who has  >>>been given so much credit in our culture.  >>>  >>>My only goal is to perpetuate truth... not slander, not name-calling, not  >>>stereotypes, not generalizations... sheer truth as it exists about all  >>>men.   Great facts. Excellent fact-finding you did. I applaud. I'm sowwy if I hurt your feelings and called you an idiot redneck. You're not, okay.   You want to "perpetuate truth", do you? Great, but I suggest first finding out what it is.   And, in closing, I'd like to invoke my "freedom of speech" (upon which I hang my hat) and say this:   Get a fucking clue.   Yours,  Alex C. Blagg   p.s. the last word ain't always right...but i look forward to hearing it.

						   My reply to Mr. Rutlidge:  stewart--   a few things...   first, my points were not -- as you say -- "hate filled". the comments I made in criticism of the conservative right were clearly mired in cynical humor, but "hate"? because i made the comment that our president has a 4th grade reading level and relies on the guidance of a shady political strategist, that means I "hate" him? i don't "hate" george w. bush. i just think he's a fundamentally incompetent person who's managed to ride the momentum of his last name to a position of leadership that was indented to be reserved for our country's best and brightest. as far as his "ivy league" education, do you really think he attended those schools based on his academic merit? he had just under a c average upon graduating from high school. yeah, all non-Bushes with a C average go to harvard. wake up...   regarding the facts you clearly spent to much time researching in the the hopes of detracting from the accomplishments of MLK, there is still not one single point in any of those statements -- even if we were to assume they were all completely true (which they aren't entirely). his name is meaningless. his political affiliation is meaningless. his academic record is meaningless. his sexual habits are meaningless. the change he brought to this country will forever overshadow any petty mudslinging perpetuated upon him by brainless automotons like yourself. if you think the worth of a man's life can be added up and measured by only his mistakes, i have pity for the world, as we will all pass as failures.   the original e-mail sent out purporting to state facts about MLK was generated by a hate group in hopes of stopping MLK day as a federal holiday. you can find this and more information at the following website:   http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/mlklies.html   while my own statements in the last e-mail were off-the-cuff and un-researched, for the sake of argument i'll admit that i shouldn't generalize and refer to all southern conservatives as "rednecks". however, if you cannot see how inane your comments -- and the comments of the original author of this e-mail are -- then i'm sure nothing i say will make a difference.   i don't hate anyone, especially not based on trivialities such as the color of one's skin. our world is slowly moving in a direction of progressive peace and equality, whether people such as yourselves like it or not. ignorance and blind hatred will be extinguished sooner or later and people like you will have little bearing on the outcome.   martin luther king, jr. was much more than a man. he was -- and is -- an idea. an idea of a world where "all men are created equal and will be judged not be the color of their skin, but by the content of their character".   again, read "letter from a birmingham prison", THEN try and make your silly points....   in pity,  Alex C.

						   So I responded with this:  whoever wrote this "MLK is a fraud" hate email is clearly an idiot with an agenda. whoever believes/supports it, a bigger one...   do you people even think for a minute about the unmitigated bullshit you mistake for the truth and send out to hundreds of your friends?   1) MLK's name is "Michael" -- who gives a shit? I don't really care if his name is Mikey or Mickey or fucking Mork. I do care that he's one of the great humanitarians of our century and should be honored for his contributions to the American quality of life...   2) MLK's "plagairism" -- So, a committee "convicted" him of plagairizing a paper from college AFTER HE WAS DEAD. Well, anyone that knows about University plagairism practices knows that the student is always given the chance to explain his/her work. He obviously wasn't because an idiot redneck shot him. And as far as the "I have a dream" speech goes, well bear in mind he was an african-american southern preacher in the 1950's and parts of that speech probably came from a lot of places -- namely his own people suffering the same injustice he was. Also, if any of you think GW Bush writes his own speeches, well, just stop voting because you're a moron. George W has about a fourth grade reading level and isn't allowed to so much as sneeze without Karl Rove conducting a poll, approving the sneeze and making sure 34 cameras from Fox News are there to catch it.   3) MLK the "communist" -- yeah, uh, the "red scare" ended more than 30 years ago. so catch up. besides, history proved that communism really wasn't so much "evil and scary" as it was another political philosophy that just doesn't work all that well. people who believe otherwise -- well -- take a remedial high school government course while you're working on that GED.   4) MLK the "pervert" -- what is the conservative obsession with the sexual habits of our leaders? are they all really THAT sexually repressed or maybe its some sort of compensation for their own incestuous, homoerotic guilt complexes? Also, I've got two word for ALL of you: Strom Thurmond. So shut the fuck up and quit monitoring the sexual practices of those of us who actually engage in it.   i normally wouldn't even waste the time addressing such obviously ignorant, hate-filled statements. but the fact that i recognize a lot of the names on this forward and i know that many of you have actually gone to college, well, i just couldn't help but to pointing out how silly and inane these groups of sentences really are.   there's a reason the rest of the country looks at the South as a bunch of under-educated rednecks. its e-mails like this. this shit is not only untrue, its hate filled and unneccessary.   surely you people learned more in college than how to start barfights and date rape...   Martin (Michael) Luther King, Jr. did more for human rights in a minute than most of you will do in your whole lives. Show some respect. I'm sure you all just HATE having to miss work for a day.   Don't forget your robes on your way to the meeting...   Alex C. Blagg

						   So I occaisionally get moronic e-mails from my conservative southern acquaintences and normally they mildly amuse me and I forget about them.  But this one was just too fucking dumb to not comment on.  So, here we go.  First I got this:  "Four things I'll bet you didn't know about Martin Luther King:"  >  >1. His name wasn't Martin Luther.  It was Michael.  It was decided  Martin Luther had a more prominent ring to it, so he went by that.  He  never legally changed his name.  To this day, he lived and died as  Michael King  >2. While working on his dissertation for his doctoral degree at Boston University, he heavily plagiarized from another author who had done research on a subject similar to King's.  An academic committee later found that over half of Kings work was plagiarized, yet would not  revoke his doctorate degree.  King was dead by this time, and the  committee ruled that  >revoking the title would serve no purpose.  It  was also discovered that King's famous I HAVE A DREAM speech was also  not his own.  He stole it from a sermon by Archibald Carey, a popular  black preacher in the 1950's.  >  >3. King was under FBI surveillance for several years (until he died) due to his ties with communist organizations throughout the country.  King accepted money from the organizations to fund his movements.  In  return, King had to appoint communist leaders to run certain districts of his SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership  Conference), who then could  project their communist ideas to larger audiences.  A federal judge in  the 60's ruled that the FBI files on King links to communism to remain  top-secret until 2027.  Senator Jesse Helms appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983 to release the files, so the bill in the Senate to create  the Martin Luther King Federal Holiday could be abolished.  He was denied.  >  >4. One of King's closest friends, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, wrote a book in 1989 in which he talked about King's obsession with white  prostitutes.  King would often use church donations to have drunken  sex parties, where he would hire two to three white prostitutes, occasionally beating them brutally.  The FBI agents who monitored King  have also reported this.  King  >was married with four children.  >  >Martin Luther King Day is a day on which this country comes to a screeching halt so we can have parades and memorials to honor this man, a man that most of the world views as a saint for his role in the civil rights movement.  No other public holiday in the United States honors a single  individual.  Of all the great leaders in our Nation's history-none of  them have their  >own holiday.  >All of our great war heroes share Memorial Day;  >All of our great presidents share President's Day.  >Yet king -- a man who was a phony, a cheater, a traitor, and a sexual degenerate gets a day of his own.  >I have a big problem with that.  I'm not trying to take anything away  from African Americans, (black people) but I am simply trying to point out that:  >The vast majority of people are sorely mistaken about Michael King;  and  >Reverse discrimination is blatantly obvious everywhere you look today.  >Have you been watching the news lately?  President Bush just got himself in some hot water when he spoke out against the University of Michigan for giving black applicants precedence over more qualified white applicants.  Now Jesse Jackson, the NAACP, and other black leaders are trashing him, without a doubt planning how they can use this.  Think about that - Bush just made a stand for equal human  rights, but lo and behold -- in this case the blacks didn't want to be  treated as equals.  >Make up your own minds, but I feel like I belong to one of the more abused ethnic groups in this country today.  >Can I do anything about it?  Absolutely not.  If I dare speak out I'll  get labeled a racist, harassed by the media, subsequently lose my job,  and never be able to show my face in public again.  >But what I can do is send this e-mail to as many people I know in hopes that when you're watching the evening news on Martin Luther King Day, and you observe our politicians falling all over themselves to be filmed  in a black church, you'll keep these above facts in mind  >  >  >  >  >Robert Sullender   251-454-4045  888-944-3648

						   I know I keep saying this, but I'm back for good now.  The holiday hiatus is over and I'm beginning the new year with a rejuvenated energy (and hatred of the ocean of republican bullshit we're all drowning in).  I'm so tired of being told what to think.  Of being told what is true.  Of being blatantly fucking lied to.  I know I'm small and my anger and opinions are relatively meaningless within the overall scheme of things, but I don't care.  I truly believe the Internet is the last frontier for true freedom of thought and speech in this country.  The means of mass communication is controlled and abused by very few, very corrupt people.  The single most awesome and powerful communication tool--television--has been pimped out like a crack-head streetwalker, used to spread lies and propaganda.    So here I am, making my voice heard.  Even if its only a whisper--maybe someone will hear...

						   The story below was taken from The Oklahoman.  It involves a House Republican who was one of the authors and chief sponsors of Oklahoma's "Defense of Matrimony Act", which is state iniative basically saying gay marriage is wrong because it's a threat to the sanctity of holy matrimony:  I love hypocracy like this:   Legislator appears in court on sexual battery charge 2004-02-27 By Diana Baldwin The Oklahoman   A House Republican on Thursday was at the Oklahoma County Courthouse pleading not guilty to a felony sexual battery charge while his colleagues were preparing to vote on the gaming bill.   Rep. Michael Edgar "Mike" O'Neal of Enid didn't vote on the bill that will allow casino games at horse racing tracks.   The charge accuses O'Neal of grabbing the buttock of a 42-year-old Tulsa woman Feb. 10 at the Holiday Inn & Suites, 6200 N Robinson Ave. He is free on $5,000 bail.   O'Neal, 55, along with his attorney, Gloyd McCoy, were at the courthouse Thursday morning so the representative could complete the jail booking process and make bail arrangements.   The lawmaker is scheduled for an April 15 preliminary hearing conference before Special Judge Fred Doak.   O'Neal sat on the front row of the courtroom, waiting for his turn before the judge. He made no comment as he left.   McCoy, asked if he wanted to make a statement, said, "I'll make it in court."   If convicted, O'Neal could face up to five years in prison. The state constitution also provides that someone convicted of a felony be suspended from office.   Ida Mae Chaplin told officers she was with a group of women in Oklahoma City attending a conference when she and the others were approached by O'Neal, according to a police report.   Chaplin reported to police she injured her ankle as she tried to flee from O'Neal, who had followed her to the hotel elevators as she and another woman tried to get away from him. O'Neal introduced himself to the woman as a state representative and handed out his business card, an affidavit states.   Contributing: Ryan McNeill of the Capitol Bureau

						   ...I'd certainly have a great deal more respect for their party.  He's always struck me as a genuine, decent--and uniquely nonpartisan--man with a real interest in making this a better country.     urlLink McCain, along with Joe Leiberman, is fighting to make sure the 9-11 independent investigation commission get the extension it needs to do a thorough examination of what really happened .  For me, this is just a no-brainer and I'm staggered by the fact that ANY PERSON could even suggest hindering this investigation on the grounds of something so silly as partisan politics.  I mean, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING?  This investigation should have NOTHING to do with the presidential election--unless someone fucked up, in which case the voters should know this.  I can't believe this is even an issue and I REALLY can't believe the "liberal" media is allowing certain Republicans to try and sweep this under the rug.  We're talking about 9 freaking 11 here--The Day That Changed Everything.  The Bush Administration has used this horrific event--and this country's emotional reaction to it--to further its own agenda on countless occaisions.  Now that we're trying to get actual answers about what really happened, the Administration (through Dennis Hastert) is trying to SUPRESS the investigation and the media is IGNORING IT.  What the fuck???  The only thing Bush ever talks about his "steadfast leadership in the war on terrorism"--well isn't finding out the truth about 9-11 the most fundamentally important part of this war on terrorism?  How can we stop them, if we don't know everything we can about what actually happened?  How can people ignore this stuff?

						   This is great.  Politicians must REALLY think we're stupid.  Well, I guess we sort of are, so you can't really blame them.   urlLink But this really cracks me up .  Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert has come out and said we will not allow the independent council investigating the 9-11 to have the extension they've requested--citing his fears that it could harm the Bush Administration in the Presidential Race.  This announcement "outraged" the White House so much that chief of staff Andrew Card actually appealed to Hastert to reconsider--to no avail.  This is so funny-sad.  Here we have a group of people trying to sort out the details concerning the single most important event in the last 100 years of American History, and not only will are the Republicans trying to hinder the process, the Bush White House is trying to pass the blame with this bullshit "no, we actually wanted the investigation but mean ole Hastert wouldn't let us" gesture.  Who the fuck does he think he's kidding.  I would've LOVED to be a fly on the wall during the Hastert/Card conversation.  Hastert:  I'm not allowing the 9-11 investigators to complete their job. Card:  Why not? Hastert: Because. Card: Will you reconsider? Hastert: No. Card: Please? Hastert: No. Card: Okay.  Fuck you, George W. Bush and all your stupid republican cronies.  From all of the families of people who died in that attack and want to know the truth, from all the Americans who are sick of being lied to, from all of us who see right through phony little act...fuck you.  Don't let the door hit you in the ass in January...

						    urlLink W should ask his brother Neil about the Sanctity of Marriage .  Neil knows all about it--especially the part about having sex with the random strangers that inexplicably show up at your door looking for loving.   urlLink Neil--along with more than half of the other Americans that get married--also knows about another sacred tenet of American matrimony--divorce!   And how could we talk about the sanctity of marriage without mentioning the miracle of childbirth?   urlLink Neil Bush knows about that, too!   In fact, while we're at it,  urlLink here's a brief history of the "Sanctity of Marriage".

When they told her the movie was a "good escape", I don't think she thought it would be anything like this.    You know, I've heard that more people have died in the name of Christ than any other reason in the world, but come on...this is just ridiculous.

I wrote her this letter:  To Susan Stanford:  I know that Jasper is just a small town in a conservative Southern state, but I'd expect anyone calling themselves a journalist to have more sense than to print the small-minded hate-filled ignorance spewed in this editorial.    I live in San Francisco and I'm a heterosexual male who completely supports ALL PEOPLE's right to marriage.  Love is intangible and not the property of any one person, government, institution or religion.  No one has ANY right to tell a person who they can or can't love--or who they can or can't celebrate that love with, in a committed marriage.      First of all, the argument you're is making is based almost completely on Christian dogma and rhetoric.  However, the issue at hand is a legal matter.  We do not live in a theocracy, and the Bible is not this country's law--ask Judge Roy Moore.  We live in a free society that (supposedly) grants all it's citizens fair and equal rights.  All have the right to worship Christ and promote the Bible's teachings; and all have the right to dismiss Christianity as a misguided and often damaging institution,  reserved mainly for the weak of heart and mind.  If you want to live in a theocracy, go to Iran--be sure to send postcards.    Personally, I'm of the opinion that the Bible--which was written before the advent of the modern sciences that essentially disprove major parts of it--is not a text one should take literally.  Your argument--made without its "support" of figurative Biblical language--is weak at its best, thinly veiled hate threats at its worst.    Too often Christians use their misinterpretations and misunderstandings of their own faith to justify hate and violence against those they don't understand--Hitler was a good example of this.  Jesus never said anything about killing anyone.  Telling people to "Suit up for spiritual warfare" is not only patently moronic, it's a subtle and potentially dangerous threat.  No matter what our differences, people in a civilized society such as our own should be able to resolve our disputes with intelligent discourse and legislation--not barbaric fighting and slaughter.  We've already got enought war to worry about right now.    The religious right is so worried about homosexuals "desecrating" the sacred institution of marriage?  Here's a little memo for you folks: We live in a country with skyrocketing divorce rates, frightening amounts of domestic abuse, and television shows that auction off brides to millionaires.  We allow people to order brides on the Internet.  Convicted murderers can marry in this country.  So please, spare us all the "sanctity of marriage" spiel--we lost our sanctity years ago.    Equality is the future of this country.  And history seems to insist on proving it.  So you can quote Revelation until you're blue in the face, but the fact is we're moving towards a world of peace and equality--with or without you (or Jesus).  Sincerely, Alex C. Blagg

						   I had the chance to catch a sneak preview of Todd ("Old School") Phillips' new film, "Starsky & Hutch".  For those of you that live in Bangladesh and haven't seen any part of the advertising blitz surrounding this movie, its another 70's TV show update--this time starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as the eponymous duo.    I had pretty high expectations going into this one--I think Stiller and Wilson make a great comedic team and Todd Phillips is probably the best straightforward-comedy director working right now.  Old School is one of those movies that, the wrong director with the wrong sense of humor, could've totally ruined.  As it is, Old School isn't great because its a great plot or story, its great because everyone involved with it was fucking hilarious.  So, is S&H as funny as "Old School"?  Well, yes and no.  There aren't really any specific scenes as funny as the funniest in Old School (ie, "I'll do one!", Streaking, Dart to the Jugular, etc.), but as a whole, Starsky & Hutch is a much better, more evenly funny movie--as in its consistently funny and entertaining whereas in Old School, when its not one of the classic scenes, the movie pretty much blows.    I knew S&H would be great when I saw the opening title card: "Bay City.  The Seventies."  This was the perfect introduction to a movie that so succinctly lampooned just about every convention of the 1970's cop movie/show.  But the movie did it without being too over-the-top.  In fact, much of the film was reminiscent of the "Brock Landers" scenes from Boogie Nights.  Phillips is taking the same jokes (cheezy 70's camera work, acting, clothing, etc.) and stretching them out over the course of an entire movie.  Highlights were: Stiller/Wilson chemistry, Vince Vaughn's bad guy, Snoop Dogg as the imminent pimp, and of course, Will Ferrell in a scene-stealing cameo.  The plot is surprisingly engaging and you'll be laughing and chuckling throughout the majority of the film.    Highly recommended viewing.  *** 1/2 stars.

						   from www.borowitzreport.com:  February 24, 2004   70% OF EXISTING MARRIAGES MAY ALREADY BE GAY   New Study Jolts White House   The Bush White House's plan to push for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriages suffered a surprising setback today as a new study revealed that well over seventy percent of existing marriages may already be gay.   The study, conducted by Dr. Charles Cranborn of the University of Minnesota, confirmed what many social scientists have long suspected: that within the first five years of marriages, most men become, for all intents and purposes, gay.   "Soon after marrying, most men stop hitting on women and start shopping for furniture," Dr. Cranborn said. "Scientifically speaking, how gay is that?"   Within ten years of marriage, Dr. Cranborn added, a significant number of married men stop having sex with women altogether.   "There's only one way to describe someone who does not have sex with women, does not hit on women, and spends his free time shopping for furniture," Dr. Cranborn added. "That word, to be scientific about it, is gay."   When news of the University of Minnesota study hit Washington, the White House immediately abandoned its plans for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage for fear of alienating the seventy percent of married voters who are already in a gay marriage "whether they know it or not," to quote Dr. Cranborn.   Instead, the Administration will ask Congress for over 1.2 billion dollars in funds to promote gay divorces.   According to those familiar with the Bush proposal, gay couples who come forward and ask for a divorce will be granted total amnesty, a dividend tax cut, and a major reconstruction project in Iraq.

						   "Retired Army Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, the former interim administrator of post-conflict reconstruction efforts in Iraq, said Thursday that a  U.S. military presence in Iraq should last "the next few decades,"  but questioned the mix of forces already there and current plans to reconfigure the armed forces as a whole." ...  "Garner said ... that the size of the Army and Marine Corps should be increased by enlarging the infantry or ground forces. And he warned that the current strain on National Guard and Reserve forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan could cripple efforts to retain experienced soldiers." ...  "Certainly the high-tech war is faster, it's neater and it works pretty good, but not in all scenarios," he said. "The problem with the Army is they just don't have enough infantry."  ( urlLink Read the entire article here .)  So, here the man in charge of Post-war Iraq is basically saying the US should maintain a presence in Iraq for DECADES, but to do so, we'll need more infantry.  And something tells me voluntary enlistment isn't soaring right now, so what this means to me is DRAFT.  While Bush hasn't directly used the word "draft", you can all bet your sweet asses that if he gets re-elected in November, we'll see the beginnings of a draft by the new year.  So that means all you right-wingers celebrating the "legitimacy" of this war can finally put your money where your asshole is.

						   If we let these degenerates get away with marrying each other and destroying one of the last bastions of purity in America, there is no telling what manner of horrifying indecencies they'll force upon us next.    Marriage is a sacred institution in this country.  Men and women who love each other make a commitment to honor this love for the entirety of their lives--and they keep that commitment.  I mean, if marriage WASN'T a sacred institution, wouldn't the divorce rates be sky-high?  Wouldn't all your friends' (and possibly your own) parents HATE each other, choosing to live in a state of mutual resentment rather than suffer the embarrassment of divorce?  Wouldn't rich people be signing some sort of pre-nuptual agreements in order to protect their assets from soulless gold-diggers who use marriage for financial gain?  I mean, come on, if we let these fags celebrate their love for one another, WHO KNOWS what might happen to the sacred bonds of holy matrimony!  Celebrities might drunkenly marry mulleted trashballs in Las Vegas before annulling the marriage and issuing a press release filled with pathetic excuses about being under pressure, confused, and partying to much.  We might even start seeing cheap reality shows where contestants compete to marry some rich moron...God forbid.   urlLink Look what's already happening in Massachusetts!   For the love of all things good and holy, write your president and BEG him to save this pure, beautiful institution of good clean Christian American marriage!

						   As many of you may or may not know,  urlLink yesterday United States Education Secretary Rod Paige called the NEA (the nation's largest teacher's union) a "terrorist organization".   Here is another wonderful example of the rhetoric of the right wing.  Republican agenda = good.  Not republican agenda = terrorist.  Okay, there's no point in beating a dead horse about the stupidity of his comments.  We know they were stupid, he knows they were stupid (he's already apologized).  However, I was looking at the Drudge Report today and found the following bit of "brilliant, insightful, hard-hitting investigative journalism" Matt Drudge is known for:  (Drudge's FRONT PAGE HEADLINE:)  "As Democrats express outrage over comments made by Education Secretary Rod Paige [he called the the nation's largest teachers union 'a terrorist organization'] a DRUDGE REPORT flashback can reveal Democrat presidential frontrunner John Kerry Has Called Republicans 'legislative terrorists'... MORE... In Jan. 1996, commenting on the federal government shutdown, Kerry called the House Republicans 'legislative terrorists,' who used federal workers as pawns and disrespected them. Asked about his terrorist comment, Kerry explained, 'Terrorists hold hostages, and the Republicans are holding the government hostage'... "  Okay.  Drudge CLEARLY doesn't understand the notion of context.  First of all, Kerry's comments were made in 1996, 5 years before the word "terrorist" came to mean what it does today.  Also, he said they were "legislative terrorists", implying that they were terrorizing the legislative process (which they were).  This is quite different than calling a labor union a "terrorist organization", which is in effect the same moniker associated with Al-Queda, the people that savagely murdered over 3,000 of our countrymen and women.    So, Drudge, your comments are not only inane and completely out of context--they're a testament to your own journalistic incompetence and desperation.  Please, do us all a favor and go back to doing what you do well--linking to pictures of celebrities' tits.

						   This type of stuff really pisses me off.  Recently an environmental group called Oceana--whose purpose is to educate people about the pollution and harmful damages Cruise Lines often cause to the ocean--purchased some ad space on Google.  After running the ad for two days, Google pulled the ads because, "they will not run any ad containing or linking to a Web site with "language critical of Royal Caribbean" or "the cruise industry".    What kind of free speech is that?  That's like NBC or CBS or well, Google saying they won't run any ad containing criticism of the Tobacco industry.  Not only is it unfair, it's blatantly harming environmental awareness in favor of a large industry--who obviously also spends a great deal of money advertising on Google.  Google surfers can troll for porn, join terrorist groups, or find the online political rantings of people like myself, but they won't allow someone to point out an industry that is potentially harming our oceans???   urlLink Find out more here.

						   I strongly encourage any of you out there with a conscience to head over to  urlLink NRABlacklist.com  and sign their petition.  They've already got over 175,000 names on the list, which will soon be submitted to Congress.  Now, before you gun nuts start wigging out and bemoaning the 2nd amendment, realize that this petition is not directly calling for the BAN of firearms.  Mainly, its concerns the 3 following issues:  1 Renew and strengthen the Assault Weapons Ban.  The NRA wants to put military style rapid-fire assault weapons that have been banned for ten years back on the street. We must tell Washington no way is this going to happen. The Assault Weapons Ban must be renewed and strengthened.     2 Keep the courthouse door open for victims of gun crimes.  The NRA wants to slam the courthouse door shut on victims of gun crimes by granting immunity for Bull's Eye Shooter Supply and other gun dealers. Bull's Eye armed the D.C. snipers and also sold guns used in 52 other crimes. If this happens, the families of victims of the DC snipers will have their suits against Bull's Eye thrown out of court. The dealer walks away scot-free.     3 Defend the Brady Bill - Repeal the Tiahrt Amendment.  Caving to NRA pressure, Congress recently passed a bill that will destroy records of all allowed firearm sales within 24 hours instead of the current 90-day law. It will also block the ATF from requiring gun dealers like Bull's Eye Shooter Supply (the dealer who armed the DC Snipers) to take regular inventories of their firearms.     Gun Violence is a uniquely American crisis that must be stopped.  The NRA are little more than a group of racist, redneck, ignorant hate-mongers hell-bent on arming themselves to the teeth in preparation for the "invasion" of the blackies, commies, terrorists, vampires, martians or....whatever other ridiculous and completely non-existent threat they can come up with.  These people must be stopped.  Do what's right.

						   Even though Ben Affleck has dove headfirst into the deep end of the swimming pool of suckdom, there was a time when he and cohort Matt Damon were talented young writers and they created a pretty damned good movie "Good Will Hunting".  In one of the better scenes in the film, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) explains why he's decided against taking a job with the NSA.  Here's his answer:  "Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.? That's a tough one, but I'll give it a shot. Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it & maybe I break it. And I'm real happy w/myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding & 1500 people I never met, never had no problem w/get killed. Now the politicians are sayin', 'Send in the Marines to secure the area' 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. He comes back to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day & no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a govt. that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the little skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little anchillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at 2.50 a gallon. They're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back, of course, maybe they even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink martinis & fuckin' play slalom w/the icebergs, & it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil & kills all the sea life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work, he can't affort to drive, so he's got to walk to the job interviews, which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod w/Quaker State. So what'd I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it, why not just shoot my buddy, take his job & give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe & join the National Guard? I could be elected president."  Amazing how sometimes fact is as true as fiction...  (thanks Nick)

						   This probably won't matter to most of you, but I can't help it--this is TOO fucking much.

						    urlLink Laura Houston's Article About Life at Ole Miss   First off, I'd like to point out a few things.  One, I went to Ole Miss for a year.  While my main reason for leaving had to do with my career path, I certainly wasn't having second thoughts about missing Oxford itself.  I found the majority of the people I encountered there lived in a superficial, borderline delusional, completely small-minded little bubble of small-town redneck ignorance.  Their lives--outside of the meaningless realms of Greek Life, football games, and binge drinking--seems silly and rather and empty to me.  I remember girls receiving suicide counseling during rush, fathers being drunker than their college-aged kids during tailgates in the grove, functionally illiterate frat guys who were 25 years old and still showing up at the house to haze freshman, and some of the worst alcohol-influnced human behavior imaginable (some of which I contributed to).    As someone who never really felt like a part of this strange little world, I often thought about the peculiar subculture I witnessed in Oxford on a daily basis.  I've always fantasized about making a documentary about it because -- and many Ole Miss students won't believe this -- most of the world at large would be both fascinated and horrified if they were to witness the day-to-day realities of life as a student at Ole Miss.  Secondly, I went to high school with Laura Houston (the girl who wrote the article).  I like Laura and I think she's a sweet girl and my intention here is not to disrespect her or her writing.  But her article is, for me, an unintentional but telling glimpse into the curious backward-thinking of much of the South.  Throughout the course of the article, Houston makes a number of statements that seem to almost gloat about the fact that Ole Miss students are living in a state of apathetic, oblivious ignorance.  While writing for a widely-read national news magazine who's clearly looking for her opinions of national politics and events, she makes statements like, "Our most celebrated alumni are still beauty queens, quarterbacks and, of course, Trent Lott."  When writing about the candidacy of Howard Dean, she inexplicably starts talking about tailgating, girls in cocktail dresses, and alcohol.  I always joked that Ole Miss was shallow, but she's ostensibly confirming it in national print.    "Mississippians just don't like change very much."  At least she got that right.  And its unfortunate that while most of the rest of the country is moving in a more progressive direction, the South seems hell-bent on keeping things the way they were back in the slave days.  Why can't they let it go and accept they were wrong?   "They also don't like Democrats."  Wow.  That looks really good for the school that's trying to bill itself as the "Harvard of the South".  I guess it is sort of like Harvard--only stupid.    "All fall, students had rolled around campus with REBELS FOR HALEY bumper stickers tacked to their Mercedeses, Lexuses and gas-guzzling SUVs".  I mean she's seriously BRAGGING here.  How stupid can you get.  We're in the middle of a war where people are dying every day for oil (i know i know, its not about oil, its cause the WMDs.  Or, wait, no, Saddam's evil.  Yeah, that's the ticket...Saddam) and she's bragging about "gas-guzzling SUV's" as if being environmentally conscious were some sort of character flaw.  "So it seems strange that Dean should be anointed the choice of young America. The young Americans at my school are pretty happy with the president they've got."  Apparently she doesn't realize that--outside the little Oxford bubble she lives in--there is a whole big world full of young people who've skipped a couple tailgate parties, stopped getting their news from beauty queens turned Fox correspondents, and actually put some THOUGHT into their political beliefs, rather than just repeating whatever bullshit some drunk idiot at a frat party was feeding her before passing out in a puddle of his own piss.  At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter.  Ole Miss, whether it chooses to acknowledge this or not, is a relatively small, meaningless little place whose collective ignorance and opinions will bear little effect on the hearts and minds of the people in this country who truly care about our world--and how we can make it better.    P.S.  Seeing as Newsweek is a pretty liberal magazine, I can almost hear the shrieking laughter of their editorial staff when they realized they were going to get to totally punk the South without having to write a single word.

						   "That's very important for, I think, the people to understand where I'm coming from—to know that this is a dangerous world. I wish it wasn't. I'm a war president. I make decisions here in the Oval Office in foreign policy matters with war on my mind. Again, I wish it wasn't true, but it is true. And the American people need to know they got a president who sees the world the way it is. And I see dangers that exist, and it's important for us to deal with them. … The policy of this administration is … to be realistic about the different threats that we face."  --George W. Bush on "Meet the Press"  "Sees the world the way it is"?  "I see dangers that exist"?  "To be realistic about the threats that we face"?  Is this man kidding?  WE DIDN'T FIND ANY WEAPONS.  WE PROBABLY WON'T.  THERE WAS NO THREAT.  Saddam is an evil despot and we got rid of him, but he WAS NOT VERY THREATENING.  Pakistan & Saudi Arabia DO have nuclear capablities.  North Korea does too.  These are real threats about which he's done little.  Does it not freak anyone else out that the President of the United States is beginning to sound more and more like some like of crazed evil genius hell bent on conquering the world?

						   You've really got to hand it to the Right.  The past few weeks have been a wild reversal of fortune for their fearless leader George W. Patton.  He's polling lower than ever, there's scandals brewing left and right (AWOL, Valerie Plame leak, intelligence manipulation), the job market is still stalling, and FINALLY people in this country finally beginning to wake up to the reality that this man's presidency is a Sham.  So what's a political strategist to do?   urlLink Find a shady internet gossip columnist who considers himself to be a legitimate news source and get him to drudge up some unproven, unsubstantiated bullshit about the man who's gaining the momentum to send Bush AWOL from the Oval Office .    Is this really all the right wing is capable of?  Shitty sex scandals?  Its like their trusty old fallback.  But what pisses me off about this is we are living in incredibly chaotic times -- the economy is hurting, our soldiers are coming home in body bags, there's still a terrorist threat (at least that's what the color says), the Middle East is getting worse, the environment is being destroyed, there are REAL (as in not fictional) threats of nuclear attack.  And the BEST THING these republican idiots can think to talk about is who John Kerry might have been banging.    And I love the hypocricy of it.  While Scott McClellan is defending his refusal to answer pointed questions about Bush's service record by saying, "We refuse to engage in gutter politics...", his stupid party (this just REEKS of Karl Rove) is doing everything they can to find a way to prove Kerry was sleeping with a woman who wasn't his wife.  Gutter politics?  Republicans fucking INVENTED gutter politics.  Give me break....

						   All I have to say about this is Fucking-A.  STATEMENT OF SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER TOM DASCHLE ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S BUDGET   "The document the White House has submitted this week cannot be taken seriously as a budget. As vast and extensive as this budget seems, the Administration has omitted essential facts and data that will have enormous consequences for our fiscal future and our economy. There is not a dime in this budget to cover the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the fact that the CBO estimates the cost of these efforts in the coming years will exceed $200 billion. In addition, by stopping short and projecting five years ahead, the budget hides the full cost of the President's tax breaks. When you include the five years after the budget projections stop, the President's tax breaks will add trillions more to the national debt.   We can't predict every challenge our nation will face in the coming years, but you don't need a crystal ball to know that we have to commit resources to support our troops' efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. You don't need a crystal ball to know that when you ask to make tax breaks permanent, the costs will be with us for more than five years. And yet, the Administration has omitted trillions in spending and revenue shortfalls from their budget plan.    When we look closely at this budget, we learn something valuable about the Administration's choices and priorities. The Administration insists that even in the face of massive deficits, a jobs crisis, and our ongoing activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must continue their failed policies of tax cuts first, last and always. In addition to record deficits and debt, this means 2.4 million more children left behind because of underfunded education priorities; 210,000 more veterans without the health care they need; 1,200 fewer cops on our streets; and thousands of fire fighters and emergency medical personnel let go from local departments. These are choices the White House has made.    The President has chosen to provide huge windfalls for millionaires and giant corporations, and huge cutbacks for the programs that matter most to American families. If this budget passes, Americans face a future with poorer schools, higher crime, and less secure retirements. We can and must do better."

						   I think what truly separates the right wing from the left is not their political ideologies.  I think the fundamental difference between the right and left is the way each side chooses to make their case and argue their points.    First of all, I'd like to say that these statement are not all-inclusive.  There will always be exceptions, on both sides of the fence.  However, as someone who keeps up with both sides of the battle, I've made a few observations.   I'm obviously left-wing.  However, I enjoy watching right-wing media programs (an avid Fox News watcher) and spend a surprising amount of time reading the opinions of my political opponents.  How could I otherwise know what I'm arguing against?  I watch Bill O'Reilly.  I read Ann Coulter.  I enjoy other more moderate, intellectual periodicals and newspapers that could NEVER be accused of liberal bias.    However, I don't think my republican counterparts do the same.  Sure, they'll tell you exactly what they think of Michael Moore and Al Franken and Tim Robbins and all the other commie-liberal-hippie-heathens, but they consistently seem to do so without ever evaluating the actual work of the people they're so vehemently railing on.  They rely on what Matt Drudge miscontextualizes, what Bill O'Reilly lies about, what the Bush administration spins, never taking the time to do any real personal investigation of FACTS.  If you actually look at the content of the arguments of the right and left, most of the time you'll find a curious pattern.  The right relies on jingoistic blind patriotism, appealing to their audience's most obvious moralistic and emotional sensibilities (ex. good vs. evil) in a clear attempt to distort the issue from what it really is (ex. Iraq).  On the other hand, most of the leading Left-wing pundits rely HEAVILY on documented facts and intellectual rationalization (Krugman, Franken, Moore, etc.)  I mean, do think Michael Moore is as popular as he is based on personality?    The point being, in my experience, right-wing case-making tends to be mired in overheated, over-emotional rhetoric and the simple denial of opposing viewpoints or facts.  I mean, Rush Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Coulter...when have ANY of these people ever for even a moment shown any sign of less than perfect infallibility?  Michael Moore and Al Franken write meticulously researched books laying out  information largely ignored by the "liberal media" and they're slandered as "left-wing whackos".  However, when Coulter writes one of her ridiculously hate-filled, sloppily researched books, she's "right"?  This is LUNACY.  Bush lies about weapons to start a war and the WORST things you'll hear even the most FAR left-wingers saying about him is "Fuck George W.  HE's the terrorist.  He should be impeached.  Send him back to Texas...".  Margaret Cho makes some comments criticizing Bush during a MoveOn.org event and she receives a barrage of hate-filled e-mails full of racist, misogynist, hate-filled speech and threats.   urlLink I think eveyone should be required to read this telling example of the Right-wing thought process.  READ THEM HERE .  And I'd love someone to show me valid proof the Left has done anything resembling this.  The right seems to be a party of angry, small-minded, hate-filled people who are fundamentally incapable of admitting they're wrong, even when proof to the contrary is staring them in the face.  The left?  What are we?  People who believe in more equality. More peace.  A better environment.  Human rights.  Fair, honest government.  When do right-wingers get pummeled with e-mails from Democrats full of hate and racism and ignorance?  Can't anybody else see these things?

A mammary.  When did the female anatomy become evil?  Why the outrage?  Every day and every night our televisions flash images of war and violence and suffering and cruelty and advertisements telling us to take drugs and reality shows where empty people leading empty lives will do anything or hurt anybody for attention.  The news peddles hours and hours of unmitigated lies and bullshit and propaganda, all the while calling it the "truth".  We're told to drink alcohol if we want to be liked, wear certain clothes if we want to be normal, eat at certain restaurants if we want to be satisfied, go on a certain diet if we want to be skinny (so we can be liked, normal and satisfied).  The television is crack for our souls, every single day.  And suddenly, with the quick flash of a human body part, our children are unsafe, susceptible to the "evil influences" of sex.     urlLink The FCC is conducting an "investigation" of the SuperBowl half-time show.      urlLink Matt Drudge is pretending to be morally outraged while hits on his site soar.   Justin and Janet are still rich and famous and attention-starved as ever  urlLink (but they might not get to play the Grammy's).      urlLink    What the fuck is wrong with our country?  Our president lies about intelligence to drag us into an unjust war where our own soldiers and innocent civilians are dying and no one bats an eye.

						   I don't smoke cigarettes all that often--usually just when I'm drinking, which amounts to an estimated average of 5-10 cigarettes per week, just over one per day.       I started smoking in high school while dating Mary Ann Platt--a short, pointless relationship that yeilded little more than this new "habit".  We'd go out to high school parties and other underage drinking venues and I'd have some Red Dog beers or Zimas or what have you, then she'd convince me to try a cigarette.  At first they tasted like shit--and actually, they still do.  But very soon, my mind began to enjoy the harmonious relationship between cigarettes and booze.       Since then, I've gone through periods where I smoked more and smoked less, but I've smoked SOME ever since.  Because of my relatively low rate of consumption, I've never made any real efforts to quit, beyond the occaisional bitching about how I hate the taste and the way they make my lungs feel during exercise.       But I digress.  My point here was not about whether or not I should smoke or whether or not smoking is bad--anyone with a third-grade education knows I shouldn't and it is.  But I do.  Which gets me to my originally intended point--the brands of cigarettes I smoke.       I started out with Marlboro Lights.  Where I lived in the South, pretty much everyone smoked Marlboro Lights or Camel Lights--unless they were rednecks or hardcore drug/alcohol users, in which case they seemed to prefer Marlboro Reds.  For whatever reason, Marlboro Lights seemed safe, harmless and just a little classy.       Then I moved to Marlboro Ultra Lights.  Again buying into the notion that there was such a thing as a "less harmless" cigarette, I didn't mind this more tasteless option (remember, I didn't like the taste of cigarettes anyway).  I smoked these for some time.  The nice, aesthetically-pleasing silver box, the smooth, non-threatening smoke, the oral fixation they provided--this was all enough to keep me a happy customer.  Also, Marlboro seemed to have a stronghold on pop culture and my peers and--with the exception of maybe Camel--seemed to be the only cigarette brand worth killing yourself for.       So cut to the other night.  I'm hanging out the window of my apartment, having a cigarette as I sometimes do.  And it dawns on me that I'm smoking Parliament Lights.  And it dawns on me that I have been smoking these for awhile.  And I can't even remember when or why I started smoking them.  And it dawns on me that pretty much everyone I know is now smoking this brand of cigarettes.  And it dawns on me that I've never even seen an advertisement for Parliament.         I take a look at the box, a closer look--and sure enough, its a Phillip Morris company.  Those dirty little bastards--snookered me again.  What is the power this company so deftly holds over people?  Why aren't any of the other cigarette brands better?  How are they getting everyone to smoke their stupid brand without any sort of advertising or media placement?       I realize the answers to these questions are relatively meaningless, but I can't help ponder them on this vile day in Walnut Creek...

						   Richard A. Clarke's testimony to the Independent Committee investigating 9-11 was what I wish all our leaders could be--clear, genuine and honest.   urlLink You should all read this article --and forget about whatever bullshit spin the Bush/Rove machine comes up with to attack Clarke's credibility and put you back to sleep.  Excerpt from his testimony:   Clarke thanked the members for holding the hearings, saying they finally provided him "a forum where I can apologize" to the victims of 9/11 and their loved ones. He continued, addressing those relatives, many of whom were sitting in the hearing room:   Your government failed you … and I failed you. We tried hard, but that doesn't matter because we failed. And for that failure, I would ask … for your understanding and for your forgiveness .   The best part of the article--which I'm omitting for brevity--is how Clarke responds to the Republican monkeys on the commission who try to attack his claims as contradictory to some background press briefing he did a couple years ago.  Really interesting stuff...

						   I was poking around in the  urlLink comments section of Drew's blog  today when I noticed a reference to one-time WWF champion "The Ultimate Warrior" now being a motivational speaker touring the country and motivating groups such as...The College Republicans.  Appealing to my love of absurd irony, this immediately grabbed my attention.  For those of you who’ve never counted yourself an avid fan of the high brow drama of WWF wrestling, The Ultimate Warrior was at one time the most widely celebrated star in the “sport”—even beating pro wrestling’s Messianic posterboy Hulk Hogan, in both the ring and the hearts of rabid fans.  (I don’t mean to imply ALL the fans have rabies, just some.)  Now, I guess I just thought there was something wonderful and perfect and hilarious about the fact that College Repblicans--young men and women enrolled in UNIVERSITIES, eager to become the "leaders" of tomorrow--are being "motivated" by professional wrestlers.    Now, The Ultimate Warrior (who now just goes by Warrior—his legal name) isn’t just speaking to the Northern Duluth Community College Republicans—he was a FEATURED SPEAKER at last year’s 55th biennial College Republican convention at the Capitol Hilton in Washington—alongside other “warriors” Karl Rove, Tom DeLay and Senator Bob Barr.    There’s a  urlLink MUST READ STORY HERE  that’s actually—and hilariously—written from a conservative viewpoint.  I challenge even the most Hannity-ish Republican to read this article and not feel flushed with embarrassment at being associated with a group of such deluded, deranged and downright dangerous idiots.    Some of my favorite parts of “Warrior’s” speech:   Dressed in a blue pinstriped suit, his long, dirty-blond hair pulled into a ponytail, Warrior explained why he'd left the world of wrestling. "When it became  degenerate and perverted," he said, "I dismissed myself from pursuing it as a career anymore."   Uh…when was wrestling NOT degenerate and perverted?  It’s always been a bunch of ‘roided out meat-heads wearing tights, jumping around a trampoline and cartoonishly beating each other.   "America was founded on that primary premise, that America would survive only as long as its people live up to their means," Warrior thundered.   " Knowledge of good and evil is the best fruit on the tree of knowledge ."    What!?!?  Again, let me remind you, dear reader—this is the NATIONAL COLLEGE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION—not a Saturday night swap meet in Bucksnort, TN.   The conservative movement, he declared solemnly, " needs people ready to actualize the entirety of their human potential ."   One message that was clear was a hatred of nuance or ambivalence. To defeat the "pervasive degeneracy, ignorance and destruction of soul" that prevails today, he said, " you must live to judge and be ready to be judged ... extremism in defense of moral behavior is no vice ."  The saying "there are two sides to every story," he told his audience, "brings your loved ones closer and closer to tyranny and outright annihilation ."     "Mankind survives by our leaders," he concluded. "All leaders are warriors. Mankind survives by its warriors. Our Republic will truly survive by them as well."   I mean, he goes from sounding like L. Ron Hubbard to Osama bin Laden to Adolf Hitler.  As I sit here pondering the notion of a roomful of young people, most of whom are generally considered to be our “best and brightest”, I’m filled with a fear and agony that cannot easily be described.    I wish I could say that this is all meaningless, that young students—many of whom will move on to the arena of prominent national politics—aren’t sitting in a room somewhere, attentively being moved by the words of madmen.  But I can’t.  Because they are.    Whether it’s the Warrior from the ring or the “warriors” in the White House (again, I remind you they’re sharing the same stage), the sad fact is we’re a nation being led by people who might very well be clinically insane.  The lunatics haven’t taken over the asylum—they ARE the asylum.  What’s the difference between the Warrior’s incoherent, sometimes frightening gibberish and Karl Rove’s insidious stream of propaganda, delivered to a crowd of conformists mindlessly chanting, “USA! USA! USA!”?  Probably just the face paint…  Here’s to a brighter future...  (Update:   urlLink CLICK HERE  to visit "Warrior's" official website.  This man is psychotic.)

						    urlLink There's an Atheist protesting the phrase "under God" in the pledge of allegiance , citing it as being unconstitutional.    Seperation of church and state is an issue that's been around a long time, surfacing around a number of issues--abortion, gay marriage, the pledge, etc.  Basically, as an agnostic (i.e. not an atheist, but not a beleiver in the Judeo-Christian god Yahweh), I firmly believe that religion is a private matter and should be left to each individual to discover for themselves.  I certainly do not think--as a free society--we should be governing ourselves under any singular theological doctrine or dogma.  We'd be contradicting everything else this country supposedly stands for.  I absolutely agree that the phrase "under God" should be removed from our national pledge of allegiance.  While it's not an issue that impacts most of us on a day-to-day basis, it's extremely symbolic of the hypocrasy of our country's political philosophy.  It wasn't even added to the pledge until 1954, when--at the height of McCarthyism and fundamentalist right-wing lunacy--conservative lawmakers were able to push it through during a climate of fear and uncertainty.    What's scary is that--in today's world--History hasn't seemed to have taught us any lessons.  Our fear culture is the worst it's been since Senator McCarthy began espousing his fantasies about the vast commie conspiracy and ruining the lives of perfectly decent Americans nearly half a century ago.  McCarthy was able to exploit the fear and confusion of the Cold War and--under the guise of his House Un-American Activities Committee--persecute those who stood in the way of his own conservative agenda.  The House Un-American Activities Committee.  That seems like such a ridiculous name these days--at least you'd think.  But in context of modern hysteria and legislation like The Patriot Act, what's really scary is how little progress we've made as people.    Anyway, the "Under God" thing should go.  It doesn't mean you can't be Christian or Jewish or Buddhist or Hindu or Muslim or Scientologist and still be an American.  It just means we can put our religions aside and live peacefully, indivisible--with liberty and justice for ALL.

						   You should take a look at  urlLink this piece  where Paul Krugman responds to all the recent character-assassination of one time counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke's recent claims that--despite dressing up in action fighter suits and making meathead threats--Bush has in fact done a horrendous job in combatting terrorism and raising national security.     The important parts:   Did the Bush administration ignore terrorism warnings before 9/11? Justice Department documents obtained by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, show that it did. Not only did John Ashcroft completely drop terrorism as a priority — it wasn't even mentioned in his list of seven "strategic goals" — just one day before 9/11 he proposed a reduction in counterterrorism funds.    Did the administration neglect counterterrorism even after 9/11? After 9/11 the F.B.I. requested $1.5 billion for counterterrorism operations, but the White House slashed this by two-thirds. (Meanwhile, the Bush campaign has been attacking John Kerry because he once voted for a small cut in intelligence funds.)   Oh, and the next time terrorists launch an attack on American soil, they will find their task made much easier by the administration's strange reluctance, even after 9/11, to protect potential targets. In November 2001 a bipartisan delegation urged the president to spend about $10 billion on top-security priorities like ports and nuclear sites. But Mr. Bush flatly refused.  Finally, did some top officials really want to respond to 9/11 not by going after Al Qaeda, but by attacking Iraq? Of course they did. "From the very first moments after Sept. 11," Kenneth Pollack told "Frontline," "there was a group of people, both inside and outside the administration, who believed that the war on terrorism . . . should target Iraq first." Mr. Clarke simply adds more detail.  Still, the administration would like you to think that Mr. Clarke had base motives in writing his book. But given the hawks' dominance of the best-seller lists until last fall, it's unlikely that he wrote it for the money. Given the assumption by most political pundits, until very recently, that Mr. Bush was guaranteed re-election, it's unlikely that he wrote it in the hopes of getting a political job. And given the Bush administration's penchant for punishing its critics, he must have known that he was taking a huge personal risk.  So why did he write it? How about this: Maybe he just wanted the public to know the truth.   When will we be able to just admit that we got snookered?

						   This may come as a surprise to many, but I do in fact have some Republican friends.

Being that he's from Mississippi born and bred, its hard to hold his lacking political acumen against him.  He's certainly not apathetic, so that's something.  And I used to write for his fabled website, under the moniker One Angry Dwarf.  Good Times.  But now he's back with a streamlined version of  urlLink Snydernews , in blog format.  So if you haven't already, check out his site--and make sure to point out to him when the Republican propaganda he's so dutifully espousing stands in direct contradiction to facts, and what is considered to be the most basic of human logic.

						   George W. Bush can say he's tough on terror until his face is redder than it was back in '72 after an awesome kegger and an eight-ball of blow.  But the fact is, he ignored Al Qeada's threats before 9-11.  And after 9-11, he did little more than make fancy speeches and fly around taking part in various photo ops.    He then used this tragedy to justify a false war.  He's now using it to get re-elected.     urlLink Here's the truth about his administration's anti-terrorism policy .  Actual documents suggesting W dropped the ball bigtime.  For more on this extremely relevant topic, go out and read former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke's new book.

						   Here's why you can't trust the media (especially the deluded morons at FoxNews):  First, we see this  urlLink Kerry hit piece  (surprise!) blaming HIM for the 9-11 intelligence failures.  Yes, the Bush Administration repeatedly ignoring terror warnings is understandable, but Kerry not starting riots over a letter of concern means he's responsible for the attacks.  Well, when you look a little deeper, you see some interesting spin...  In the piece above, Primary Source and former FAA official Brian Sullivan claims that Kerry ignored his warnings about aviation security weaknesses and blames him for the attacks.  Here's a direct quote:   "[Kerry] just did the Pontius Pilate thing and passed the buck" on back through the federal bureaucracy, said Brian Sullivan, a retired FAA special agent from the Boston area who in May 2001 personally warned Kerry that Logan was ripe for a "jihad" suicide operation possibly involving "a coordinated attack."   HOWEVER, if we go back to an interview with NBC Newscaster Chris Hanson, from September 16, 2001, here's what Sullivan was saying:   HANSEN: Besides helping the TV journalists, Sullivan says he expressed his concerns to the FAA administrator's hotline. He also says he sent this letter to Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, a letter that now seems all too prophetic.   (snip)   HANSEN: Sullivan says Senator Kerry responded to his letter and asked the Department of Transportation's inspector general to look into the matter.  Mr. SULLIVAN: I think Senator Kerry did get it to the right people and that they were about to take the right action."

Now the Taliban has reformed and now controls approximately 1/3 of the country, Bin Laden's still alive an well, Iraq is a mess, bombings in Spain, etc.    Personally, I don't feel any safer.

I would not be so certain.'   Sec.  RUMSFELD: And--and...   Mr.  FRIEDMAN: It was close to imminent.   Sec.  RUMSFELD: Well, I've--I've tried to be precise, and I've tried to be  accurate.

						    urlLink A friend sent me this article today  from the LSU college paper.  Normally I'd read something like this, chuckle sympathetically, and send it along the way to my Trash folder.  However, I felt compelled to say something about this growing trend among college (and other) journalists so shamelessly and poorly ripping off Sex and the City.  Look, Sex and the City is entertaining and popular because a) it takes place in the most relevant metropolis on the planet, b) it freshly tells the story of four unique and interesting adult women, c) it offers a modern, provocative exploration of sexuality and how it affects women and men.  And the city.    So, waxing philosophical about you and your small-town Southern co-eds' love of the handjob comes off as totally unoriginal, unsubstantially arrogant and pathetically amateurish.  I try to give these wannabe Carrie Bradshaws a break because they're young and simply emulating someone they admire, but come on!  Its been like 5 years.  The show is over, for god's sake.    Why not stop pretending to be something you're not and start writing about what you are--concentrating on what's real and true and important to you?    That's what Candace Bushnell did.

						   (http://www.prospect.org/print-friendly/webfeatures/2004/03/waas-m-03-08.html)  -- sorry, hyperlinks not working at the moment.  Its amazing to me that our mainstream "liberal-hippie-commie" press isn't ALL OVER this story.  While a federal grand jury has been dishing out subpoenas left and right trying to figure out the source of the leak who compromised undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, this report surfaces.  Now, this is Karl Rove, one of President Bush's chief cabinet members and close personal advisors ADMITTING he circulated the Plame info around the office (he's under oath here, balls on the line, etc.)  However, he claims he wasn't the one who actually leaked the information to columnist Bob Novak--the moron journalist responsible for publishing the leak and flushing years of Plame's top-secret progress right down the john.

						     WASHINGTON, March 3 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters, AFL-CIO (IAFF), Harold Schaitberger, issued the following statement today after President Bush unveiled new political ads that use images of fire fighters in September 11, 2001 attacks for political gain:   -- As Bush Trades on Heroism of Fire Fighters, His Homeland Security Funding Cuts Hurt Fire Fighters and Communities --  "I'm disappointed but not surprised that the President would try to trade on the heroism of those fire fighters in the September 11 attacks. The use of 9/11 images are hypocrisy at its worst.

Well, believe it or not, the makers of the new Blockbuster "The Passion"--whichs sadistically re-enacts the beating and crucifixion of Christ--has decided to launch a cross-merchandising campaign.  It seems they've seen a marketing opportunity for people who might need "Witness Tools" (I'm not making that phrase up) such as coffee mugs, "nail" jewelry and more!    They might as well have gone to fucking Burger King and included the Bloody Jesus Action Figure in every kid's meal.    As if the $107,000,000 gross the film took in this weekend (most of which goes straight into Mel's pocket) isn't enough, they need to sell cheap gimmicky shit like the Arimaic coffee mug (real product).  This is such typical Christian-hypocritical bullshit.  Cashing in on the brutal "sacrifice" they're trying to hard to validate...

So, gentle readers, I leave you with this wonderful conclusion to the whole Nightline/Sinclair Broadcast Group fiasco I've been reporting on (read the last few posts).  The following news story was published in 1996 when Sinclair president David Smith (the man at the center of the Nightline fiasco) was arrested for doing it with a hooker.  Ha ha.  Gotta love hypocritical republican values...   Broadcasting official charged in sex stakeout Sinclair president, woman arrested in company car  Published on: August 15, 1996 Edition: FINAL Section: NEWS Page: 2B Byline: SUN STAFFPeter Hermann  372  The president of Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., which owns the local Fox television affiliate, was arrested Tuesday night and charged with committing a perverted sex act in a company-owned Mercedes, city police said.  David Deniston Smith, 45, of the 800 block of Hillstead Drive in Timonium, who also is Sinclair's chief executive, was arrested in an undercover sting at Read and St. Paul streets, a downtown corner frequented by prostitutes, Baltimore police said yesterday.  Smith and Mary DiPaulo, 31, were charged with committing unnatural and perverted sex act. Smith was held overnight at the Central Booking and Intake Center and released on personal recognizance at 2 p.m. yesterday. DiPaulo's bail status was not available.  Officials at WBFF-TV (Fox 45) and Sinclair, one of the fastest-growing broadcasting companies in the nation with 28 television and 34 radio stations, would not comment yesterday. The company had $126 million in sales in the first half of this year.  Police said undercover Officer Gary Bowman, on a prostitution detail, was talking to DiPaulo about 9: 15 p.m. in a car at St. Paul and Read streets. She left the undercover car after telling Bowman that ``she had just seen her regular date driving in the area,'' according to court documents.  Police said DiPaulo ran across the street to a 1992 Mercedes, registered to Sinclair, and got in on the passenger side. Police followed the car onto the Jones Falls Expressway, where they said they witnessed the two engage in oral sex while Smith drove north.  Police said they followed the car back to Read and St. Paul streets, where they arrested Smith and DiPaulo, who lives in the 700 block of Washington Blvd.

						   This week, ABC announced that Friday's edition of "Nightline" with Ted Koppel would be dedicated to honoring the memory of our fallen soldiers in Iraq--with Ted reading the names of each fallen soldier while their image is flashed on the screen.  ABC said this would take up the entirety of the show and was intended to be a gesture of respect for those who're paying the ultimate price in this mess.  However, it seems that the Sinclair Broadcast Group finds this message to be "contrary to the public interest" and are therefore pulling the program from their 8 ABC affiliate stations.   urlLink You can read their statement--and ABC's respone--here .

						   I'll be the first to say it--I don't like cops.  I've had several altercations with them and have come to the conclusion that--more often than not--they're undereducated redneck cowboys with serious delusions of grandeur.    I mean, let's be honest.  The best and brightest normally don't become police officers--they're underpaid, risking their lives, etc.  It's typically not the valedictorian's first career choice.  It often seems as if the majority of the people who DO choose this professoin are either one-time criminals, knee-jerk gun lovers, total racists, high school heroes who partied too much in community college, or what have you.  So as horrid as  urlLink this story sounds , I must say I'm not altogether surprised--which is kind of sad actually.  I know that I'm massively stereotyping and I should point out that police officers risk their lives to "protect and serve" us.  There are many noble, honest, hard-working police officers in the world.  It's just too bad their service often gets overshadowed by the brutish ignorance of so many of their peers...

						   From  urlLink The Borowitz Report   Updated April 12, 2004    BUSH MISSED BILLBOARD OF OSAMA     60-Foot-Tall Sign Appeared Outside White House    The Bush administration today grappled with allegations that President George W. Bush did not see a sixty-foot-tall billboard featuring Osama bin Laden that appeared suddenly across the street from the White House in August 2001.   The gigantic billboard, which featured bin Laden's stern visage and the words "I AM GOING TO HIJACK U.S. AIRPLANES VERY SOON," was first spotted by a UPS driver, Clayton Spedding, while making his morning deliveries on Pennsylvania Avenue.   "I was like, 'Didn't there use to be a Bacardi ad up there?'" Mr. Spedding, 34, told reporters today.   After making his startling discovery, Mr. Spedding called the White House, but was told to call back when he had "something more specific."   As Mr. Bush's apparent failure to notice the bin Laden billboard ignited a new round of finger-pointing in Washington, the President went on the offensive, warning the al-Qaeda kingpin to make future terror threats more explicit or "face the consequences."   In a nationally televised address, Mr. Bush said that all future terror threats that did not include "the who, what, when, where and why" in the first paragraph "would be completely and categorically ignored."   In addition to Mr. bin Laden, Mr. Bush singled out Iran and North Korea for making terror threats that were not specific enough, calling them "The Axis of Vagueness."   As for the billboard of bin Laden, Mr. Bush said that once he was notified of its existence he took appropriate action: "I asked the national security staff to find out if Saddam Hussein had put it up there."

						    "I am satisfied that I never saw any intelligence that indicated there was going to be an attack on America — at a time and a place, an attack," Mr. Bush said after attending Easter services in Fort Hood, Tex.   -- President Bush on  urlLink the "infamous" PDB memo   So, let me get this straight.  Mr. Tough on Terror/War President received a memo entitled "Bin Laden Determined To Strike In U.S." over A MONTH before The Day That Changed Everything-- urlLink while he was golfing near his ranch in Texas nonetheless --and didn't do ANYTHING about it.    If you haven't read the memo, it basically says that in advance of September 11, we knew  1) that several members of Al Queda had lived in or traveled to the United States for years ,  2) that Osama bin Ladin is undeterred by failure and plans operations years in advance , and  3) that FBI information, based on 70 separate investigations, indicated “patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.”  (paraphrased from  urlLink Neal Pollack )  So, what exactly did Captain Competency want?  A press release from al-Qaeda with names, dates, flight reservation numbers and itineraries?  Should Osama have called him up in Crawford and been like, "Heeeey, Georgie!  Just a little FYI -- some of my bro's are going to board some planes with box cutters on the morning of September 11th and fly them into buildings!  Heads up, my main man!"  No.  Of course not.  That's why they're terrorists.  That's the whole concept of terrorism--being "terrorized" by not knowing when or where the attacks will happen.  However, it is the responsibility of our elected officials and federal government to do their very best to use their intelligence (both personal and military) to determine where measures should be taken to keep us secure.  For example, if one were to get a memo like W. did, one might think about putting airports into "terror alert red" BEFORE September 12th.    But you know, he was golfing...

						   You know, I'm really trying to make a concerted effort to be less cynical about things.   urlLink But sometimes it's just hard .  Basically, an anti-gay group distributed a 300-page document containing information and "research" supporting their ridiculous belief that there is a nefarious society of homosexuals hatching plots to promote their depraved agenda--even to innocent schoolchildren!  In "support" of this contention, they included a photograph from The Onion depicting an instructor "teaching" young children how to be homosexual.  Now, most people with a brain would understand that The Onion is a SATIRICAL paper whose photos aren't representing reality.  But this group used the photo as evidence of "what's happening" to our children as a result of the homosexual agenda.  They even cited the Onion as a "gay paper".  Satire is apparently lost on this particular group of fundamentalists.  And apparently irony is too.  What's so hilarious is these morons are confirming the very criticisms  urlLink the original Onion article  was making in the first place.  Isn't it ironic, don't ya think?

Now, I can respect you if you're a Republican.  But I have a real hard time respecting people who subscribe to the unmitigated bullshit these pundits peddle for truth on a daily basis.  They back up their "political beliefs"--which is actually just ratings-hungry narrowminded jingoism--with lies and false emotional appeal.  But Al Franken takes them on--and on each occasion--triumphs valiantly.  All idealogies aside, it's hard to assail pure reason and logic, which are Al's deadliest weapons.    He's now got a morning radio show on the "Air America", the new liberal talk radio station.  He's funny, smart and has an excellent grasp on today's strange political climate.     urlLink Here's a good post on his blog  where he dismantles a big bundle of Sean Hannity's lies about John Kerry--lies that we're inevitably going to hear over and over and over again throughout this election.  The right-wing has gotten good at repeating inaccuracies until they become accepted truths.

						   ...Dear handful of regular and faithful readers:  I've had a lot going on the past few days and I haven't been posting as much.  But I'm back to normal.  So keep reading.  ALSO -- PLEASE USE THE "COMMENT" FEATURE.  It can be found beneath each post.  I'd love to get some feedback on the stuff I talk about here.  Think I'm a moron?  Great, let me know.  Think I'm the greatest Political Mind since Calvin Coolidge?  Please tell me.  A good comment section really makes the site a lot better because it facilitates civil (and uncivil) debate--and we all love seeing two people get nasty and insulting over meaningless political idealogies.  At least I love that.  ALSO ALSO -- I'm in the market for a Blog upgrade.  The service I'm currently using (Blogger)--for whatever reason--isn't currently offering their upgraded service, so I might go find someone who is.  If anyone has any ideas or suggestions on this let me know.  Specifically, I'm looking to update the aesthetic design and layout of the page and I want image hosting.    Anyways, thanks for reading...

						   "Google" -- it's such a fun, colorful, silly little word!  Hey, Google!  Silly, yaaay!  Few people are aware of this friendly company's sinister and downright  urlLink freaky plans to monitor you and your emails .  My roommate works in a big interactive ad agency here in San Francisco.  He's a media planner, which means, he buys all the annoying ads you see online.  For example, if his client were Coca-Cola, he'd be buying banners and pop-ads from a wide variety of web sites and networks, where you'd see all manner of Coke ads.  One of the largest of these networks is Google.  Of course we all know that--whenever you search for something on Google--there's always those little green "paid advertisement" ads on the right side of the screen.  But did you know that the web pages that come up first in your seemingly innocuous search were also paid advertisments.  If you type in "cola" there's a reason Coca-Cola comes up first--they paid good money to do so.   Anyway, the point is:  Google has now released a new service for internet users called G-mail.  While this new free e-mail service promises almost 500 times more storage than most other e-mail providers, there's a catch.  Google has created a technology that will "Scan" the messages of the emails you send and receive, then run advertising appropriate to the content of that message.  For example, you send a message to a friend talking about missing your favorite TV show--Google then includes a TiVo ad in the message.  Google has said that they will retain copies of your messages, even after you've deleted them--thereby allowing them to compile a vast database of information about who you are as a consumer...  Maybe I'm just a crazy left-wing conspiracy nut, but that shit kinda freaks me out.

						    urlLink Nice speech by Ted Kennedy :  Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy on Monday accused President Bush of having created at home and abroad "the largest credibility gap" since the Watergate scandal forced Richard Nixon from the White House 30 years ago.   Kennedy, a key backer of fellow Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry's campaign for the party's presidential nomination, also charged Iraq has become "George Bush's Vietnam," the war that divided the United States and helped drive Lyndon Johnson from the presidency.   In addition, Kennedy said, Iraq has "diverted attention from the administration's deceptions here at home -- especially on the economy, health care and education."   ...  "Sadly, this administration has failed to live up to basic standards of open and candid debate," Kennedy said in a speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.   They repeatedly invent 'facts' to support their preconceived agenda -- facts which administration officials knew or should have known were not true," Kennedy said.   The senator said, "As a result, this president has now created the largest credibility gap since Richard Nixon," who was forced to resign as president in 1974 as a result of the Watergate scandal that exposed abuses of power   ...  Iraq. Jobs. Medicare. Schools," Kennedy said. "Issue after issue. Mislead. Deceive. Make up the needed facts. Smear the character of any critic."   "It is undermining our national security, undermining our economy, undermining our health care ... undermining our very democracy," Kennedy said. "We need change. November can't come soon enough.

						   I am hereby publicly announcing that I will no longer affiliate myself with the Democratic, Green or any other left-leaning political ideology or school of thought.  I, Alex C. Blagg, am now—and will forever be—an official member of the Republican Party.   Last night in my sleep I had a glorious and clarifying vision.  There was a warm yellow light than shined all around me.  I saw the world in a way I’ve never known before.  And I then realized that my long-held radical opinions about politics were both wrong and dangerous—to myself, and this great country.  I allowed my leftist agenda to cloud my objectivity, thereby rendering me incapable of seeing the truth about society here in America.  You see, I’ve always held the contention that capitalism is somehow an inherently evil, destructive form of government.  Never did I consider the notion that capitalism—in theory—is the most honest, productive and effective way for a human society to stratify itself.  It appeals to the most basic tenets of Human Nature and therefore—though imperfect—is the best way by which we might govern.  I’ve dedicated so much of my intellectual energy to bashing and slandering President George W. Bush.  I’ve viewed him with a resentment and hatred matched only by the cynicism with which I attempted to attack him.  This has been wrong.  Upon deeper reflection, I came to the conclusion that George W. Bush is—in certain ways—the greatest American president to serve since our founding fathers.  His love for the sacred ideologies of this country is almost unmatched and his actions—both successful and otherwise, both honest and less than—have all been in the interest of service to the greater idea of American the Beautiful.  I’ve been naïve to criticize his seeming dishonesty, never acknowledging that—in the realm of contemporary American politics—dishonesty comes with the job.  In fact, our country NEEDS a certain amount of dishonesty among its leaders.    During his tenure, George W. Bush has strengthened the power of the Justice Department and the military—which keeps us safer.  He’s stood firm as a symbol of our nation’s resolve to rid the world of the threat of evil terrorists.  In perhaps the greatest presidential humanitarian efforts since Abraham Lincoln, he liberated the Iraqi people from the oppressive, terrorist regime of Saddam Huissen.  He’s committed to improving education, reviving the Space Program, and—by expanding free trade—brining prosperity to all humans on Earth.  I can’t take back the things I’ve said, but I’m at least man enough to admit when I’ve been wrong.  Bush/Cheney ’04!  Happy April 1st, Fools!

						   Last nite was craaaaazy, man.  After work, I was just planning on having a quiet night, maybe grabbing a bite to eat and going to see a flick or something.  Then Max calls.  "Hey, man--I've got some friends in town.  I think we're gonna hit up Hush Hush, then go to this party."    Hush Hush has 25 cent beer on Fridays.  Shit.  I agree to meet them there, on the condition that they don't let me get hammered and I'm home--in bed--by midnight.  Max agrees.  Cut to: midnight.  I'm at some party in Dolores Park--clearly hammered.  I'm talking to this girl from Guadalajara, Mexico.  She's trying to teach me Spanish, but all I really know how to say is "Buenos Dias", "Muy Bien", "Y Tu Mama Tambien", "Amores Perros" and "21 Gramos".  But its enough, she's impressed.  She makes me drink tequila--and I swear I remember a group of grown adults doing Whip-Its in the dining room.  Who does Whip-Its?  Max decides to leave but the Guadalajara chick won't let me go.  It's like 2 am now.  I eat some rum-soaked pineapple that this dude brought as a snack.  It's wonderful, but I can't shake the nagging feeling that this night is somehow going to end badly.  I decide it would be in my best interest to head outside for a cigarette.  And that's when it happened.  The Girl From Guadalajara follows me outside, despite my constant protests that I'll be okay on my own.  She's speaking only in Spanish jibberish now and I'm becoming annoyed because I have no clue what the fuck she's talking about.  She walk out onto the front porch, which has a long staircase up from the street to the door.  As she approaches me, she slips in her stiletto heels, her legs buckle for a moment, then she careens forward, down the stairs--about 12 of them.  I hurry down to see if she's okay, and she's conscious but she's bleeding and just looking all fucked up, so we call 911.  The ambulance comes, takes her off, I've already finished my smoke and Max is gone, the party's thinning, I eat some more of the pineapple.  I feel lonely in the cab ride home.  I guess we all float on...

						   Hahahaha...   urlLink This is exactly what I was talking about yesterday  when I was making my point about why Ashcroft's showy drama with the Wanted Posters was ridiculous and a complete waste of time.  Here's some excerpts:   The FBI office in Denver has received "numerous" calls about the seven people believed to be associated with al-Qaeda pictured Wednesday in newspapers...Samuel Mac, manager of the Denny's in Avon, isn't happy with the response he got from the FBI when he reported that two of them ate at his restaurant Wednesday...One ordered a chicken sandwich and a salad, the other just a salad, Mac said. They were demanding, rude and obnoxious, he said...   God, it sounds like something out of The Onion.  Yes, the American Public is on its way to bringing down the entire Al-Qaeda network.  I wish I could've heard the FBI phone conversation:  FBI: Denver Bureau, may I help you? Denny's: Yeah, this is Mac down at the Denny's off Interstate 70--I think I got a couple terrorists on my hands here.  They came in acting all swarthy and surly and I got a feelin' them towelheads were just the men I saw on that poster on the news today. FBI: Uh-huh. Denny's: I sent one of the busboys after 'em in the pickup, so we're trying to establish a tail. FBI: A tail? Denny's: Yeah, we're tailin' em.  I'll let you know when we get visual confirmation. FBI: Sir, please...don't tail anyone.  What exactly makes you think they were terrorists? Denny's: They were from Iran, I heard one of 'em say. FBI: ... Denny's:  IRAN, I said.  Terrorist.  I've already got Scooter comin' down with my shotgun, so I think the situation is pretty much under control.  Just wanted to keep you folks in the loop.  We're gonna check every outhouse, farmhouse-- FBI:  --Sir, please don't do anything.  We'll check it out, thanks for your call. Denny's:  Y'all need some undercover operatives? FBI: No sir, we're all set. Denny's:  --'Cause I was only three tests away from graduating the Denver police academy. FBI:  Sir, no.  We're good.  Thank you-- Denny's: (in the background) --Mac, we need a Grandslam Breakfast down here, pronto!   ::click::

						   Dear Hummer-driving Financial District Douchebag Who Almost Hit Me:  I was really enjoying my nice afternoon walking around the majestic streets of Downtown San Francisco--that is, before you nearly flattened me with your big, cheesy H2 road tank.  First of all--despite what you might have seen in the various Hummer commercials--there really is no "rocky, muddy or mountainous terrian" here in San Francisco.  You're not going to need to navigate through boulders, snow or really any other excessively difficult physical environment.  We've got fog.  And the fog is going to be a pain in the ass whether you're a brand new Hummer or an '89 Celica.  No, this is a CITY which means pretty much everything here is PAVED, hence--the 90 inch radials are a bit uneccessary, don't you think?  I'm not sure whether or not you know that oil prices are now over 40 dollars a barrel, or that we're in a worldwide CRISIS (not to mention a war)--I imagine you probably don't really give a flying fuck.  No, as long as you've access to the shopping mall, Justin Timberlake music (which you were so flagrantly blaring) and "Friends" reruns, you probably don't really mind shelling out the $80 it required to fuel up your roadhog.    Now, douchebag, here's where things get personal.  I was walking down the street, minding my own business, when you whip around the corner--going way too fast--then slam on the breaks in avoid mowing me down.  THEN you flip ME off, incredulous that I could put MY BODY in the way of YOUR HUMMER.  I'm sorry, Mr. Douchebag--I know you were probably in a hurry to get your pubic hair waxed or something, but I just didn't see you roadbeast coming.  Sorry.  So, after you "peeled out" and blazed past me, I'd barely had the chance to turn around when I heard the brutal, unmistakable sound of concrete crushing metal.  I guess maybe you were going too fast, maybe you were just too into the JT song or maybe you were overwhelmed by excitement about getting your shit waxed.  I don't know.  But THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for not seeing the sign on the parking garage than read "Maximum Height 7 Feet"--watching you completely fuck up the roof of your stupid Hummer has been the highlight of my week.  Instant Karma's gonna get ya', Alex C. Blagg

						    urlLink This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard .   "WASHINGTON - America's top law enforcement officials urged the public Wednesday to help the FBI track down seven suspected al-Qaida operatives and avert an attack on U.S. soil that a stream of credible intelligence indicates could occur in the summer."   Okay, first of all, this is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by the Bush Administration to scare/distract us all away from the comprehensively shitty job they're doing "running the country".    Secondly, they're asking the AMERICAN PUBLIC to help "track down suspected terrorists".  Why don't they just start running "Uncle Sam Wants YOU...to commit hate crimes" ads?  The American Public can hardly be trusted with programming the clock on their microwaves--now the Justice Dept is trying to recruit them into hunting down Osama bin Laden and his operatives--something our highly trained, Robocop-looking soldiers apparently can't even do?  Right.   Finally, they add emphasis by releasing a ridiculous "Wanted" poster showing off the fact they actually know who a few of the suspected terrorists are--of course leaving out the fact we've known about these suspects for years now--just in case any of these people actually ever DO try and attack us.     Each of the suspects, Ashcroft said, presents "a clear and present danger" to the United States.   Besides borrowing phrasing from Tom Clancy novels--just to be sure "middle america" understands--Ashcroft seems to be saying, "You know, Terrorists aren't just Towel--I mean, 'Arabs' anymore.  Now they're also Asians, Whites, Blacks.  Call 911 if you see any of the previously described races!".    Wow, thanks for that clarification, John.  I'll be sure to look out for any Whites, Blacks, Asians or Arabs...

						   George W. Bush gave a speech the other night.  In typical W fashion, he said some stuff about America and freedomloving, and good and evil, terrorists and justice and blah blah blah...  He seemed incredibly proud of his "5-Point Plan" for getting us out of the Iraq mess.  Basically, his "plan" can be summarized as: we're in a mess, we need to get out, Iraq will govern themselves at some point in the future, eventually we'll withdraw forces.  Wow, George--that's fucking brilliant.  Another amusing part of the speech was the obligatory mention of the Abu Ghirab prison abuse scandal.  I was curious to see what sort of Rovian foolishness the president would use to try and take pressure off the situation.  George's solution--we'll destroy the prison!  Yeah!  That'll fix everything!    Um, W -- I think ( urlLink and I'm not alone on this ) it would be pretty dumb to destroy a fully functional government facility just to say sorry for actions that are--at least in some capacity--your fault to begin with.  It's not as if Iraq is bathing in extra cash to just blow up and rebuild prisons all loosey-goosey.    In fact, I laughed out loud when I read the Iraqi leaders' response to GW's "big idea":   Oqail Sawar, a columnist for the Al-Ayam daily, declared that the only way to remove the injustice from Iraq is not to tear down Abu Ghraib but for the United States to make a genuine apology and for "the torturer murderers to be handed over to an objective, international, just judiciary."    On Tuesday, Ahmed Hassan al-Uqaili, deputy chief of the Human Rights Organization in Iraq, dismissed Bush's promise as a Republican ploy "to win the (presidential) election in the United States."    I love Bush Rhetoric.  Really, I'm going to miss it...

This is something I've been thinking about of recent.    So, I'm going to start integrating my own personal feelings--about life, love and human existence--on an at-least-semi-daily basis.

The U.S. military said it could not confirm the report and was investigating.  Lt. Col Ziyad al-Jbouri, deputy police chief of the city of Ramadi, said between 42 and 45 people died in the attack, which took place about 2:45 a.m. in a remote desert area near the border with Syria and Jordan. He said those killed included 15 children and 10 women.  Dr. Salah al-Ani, who works at a hospital in Ramadi, put the death toll at 45.  Associated Press Television News obtained videotape showing a truck containing bodies of those allegedly killed.

						   ( urlLink a recent story by Phil Lucas , editor of the prestigous "News Herald" in Panama City, Florida)  Dear Phil Lucas,  I'm sorry but you've made absolutely no good points.  In fact, your small-minded jingoistic attitude is rather indicative of a major and growing problem with the under-educated masses of our country these days.  You published pictures of burned American CONTRACTORS (ie. Halliburton-employed Mercenaries in Iraq for Cash, thereby accepting the dangers of their charge) presumably in an attempt to remind all your readers that--despite whatever the torture prison photos that have dominated the media might suggest--the Evil Muslims are so much worse than us.  First of all--you're COMPARING our soldiers (prison photos) to the Evil Terrorists (burned corpses).  That's great.   He then you go into an unapologetically racist rant about how Muslims are apparently the root of all the world's evil, murder, death and suffering.  How--for Centuries--the Muslims have been single-handedly inflicting their fanatic violence upon the innocent Christian world.  Well, sorry but that is just complete bullshit.  Fanaticism can be found in the bowels of almost every major world religion.  In fact, if you wanted to make a more legitimate point, you could maybe pontificate the tragic fact that--historically--more people have died in the name of God (or Jesus or Allah or Zeus or Whoever) than any other cause.  Since we stepped out of the primordal sludge, we've been killing each other over the differences in our spiritual mythologies.  I think it's silly and sad, too--but I'm neither arrogant nor moronic enough to fault one people for this unfortunate reality.   "Madeline Albright, the former secretary of state and feckless appeaser who helped get us into this mess..."  It's easy to point fingers, to blame one person or one president or one race.  However, the problem with our country is we're so arrogant and certain of our own righteousness that we've never seriously taken a moment to evaluate why these people might WANT to kill us.  Good and evil?  Come on, go back to grade school.  THEY THINK THEY'RE AS RIGHT AS WE THINK WE ARE.  In their opinion, we've invaded and desecrated their holy lands, for which they want to kill us.  A little barbaric and harsh?  Certainly.  But simply dismissing their religous beliefs as "crazy", "whacko" or inferior to our own is both pig-headed and counterproductive.   Also--the American Contractors burned in Iraq had nothing to do with theological differences.  WE INVADED THEIR COUNTRY WITH NO GOOD REASON OR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.  Does anyone ever stop to think how we'd feel if Saudi Arabia or China or Whoever suddenly invaded OUR country and indiscriminately locking up OUR citizens?  We would respond violently.  This isn't about EVIL--they're violently protesting their (somewhat understandable) view that we've wrongfully invaded their country.     "Maybe we’re so addled on Ritalin we wouldn’t know which end of a gun to hold. Maybe we need a new drug advertised on TV every three minutes, one that would help us grow a backbone."   Um, this is gibberish.     "It doesn’t take a Darwin to figure out that in this world the smartest, the fastest, the strongest, and the most committed always win. No exceptions."   This is coming from a person who probably doesn't even believe in evolution.  Also, you're apparently saying that "Might Makes Right", which is utter crap (Hitler, Rome, etc.)   "Look at your spouse and children. Look at yourself in the mirror. Then look at the pictures from the paper last Thursday. You better look at them. Those are the people out to kill you."   Those people live in Fallujah and they probably wouldn't have messed with any of us if we hadn't charged into their country with our tanks and bombs and missles and started slaughtering their people.  However, now that we have, you're probably right--they probably do hate us.  Again, responding to 9-11 with our stupid cowboy knee-jerk violence is EXACTLY what the real terrorists wanted.  We've just spawned a whole country full of new America-hating terrorists.  Osama is probably happier than a pig in shit right now.   The only way any of this is ever going to get better is if Americans can--for one second--accept the differences of the rest of the world for what they are.  The "tolerance" and "diversity" you take such cynical pleasure in trashing are the very things that will save our species.  The human race is infinitely diverse.  We're never going to be a planet of just Jesus-loving Capitalist Democratic People.  We're always going to be different than others--its just a matter of when we're going to learn that the way to stop terrorism is with kindness and charity--not killing.  As the "biggest, richest, most powerful", we could do a lot more good in the world by spreading around our disproportionately large amount of wealth than we ever will by trying to force our way of life upon people who will never accept it...   You're a moron, sir.    Sincerely,  Alex C. Blagg

						   Alright, I'm out till Monday.  This weekend -- buying a new dining room table, going to see "Cigarettes and Coffee" and "Troy", checking out Wired NextFest, doing comedy at SF Comedy Club on Saturday night, watching the naked drunkards and freaks run across the entire length of San Francisco at the Bay To Breakers Run, and seeing the French Kicks on Sunday at Bottom of the Hill.   I'm going to do my best to have a completely sweet weekend.  Its my sincere wish you do the same.  Unless you're Sean Hannity.  If you're Sean Hannity--get fucked.

						   I'm sorry, I try to keep my personal feelings and emotions out of my politics, but some times I just can't.  Dear Bloodthirsty Right Wing Convservative Fundamentalist Moron Fucks:  You make me sick.  An innocent person has to suffer a gruesome, disgusting and tragic death, and all you people care to do is make some stupid political point with it?  Use it as--what--PROOF that the terrorist are indeed evil?  Use this person's unimaginable suffering as a justification for a president's rogue actions?     urlLink The Rightwing pundit dipshits are all worked up into a tizzy, howling for the media to show more images/footage of the Nick Berg beheading in order to "take the heat" off the bad press generated by the prison abuse photos .  They're trying to turn this into a contest of who's the greater evil--us or the terrorists.  THAT SHOULD NOT EVEN BE DEBATABLE.  THE FACT THAT IT IS MAKES ME WANT TO CRY.  Sean Hannity--I hope you're right.  I hope there really is a hell.  Because if there is, you will undoubtedly burn in it.  You are a disgusting human being.   urlLink Fuck you for subjecting the listeners to the sounds of a human being getting their head sawed of .  You sick sadist fuck.  Howard Stern and Janet Jackson are getting fined by the FCC for indecency and you're playing audio tracks of a live murder.  THIS COUNTRY IS INSANE.  You are all INSANE.  Right now the top searched terms on every major internet search engine are "nick berg beheading video"--what kind of mass insanity is this???  Why do people have a pornographic desire to see such brutal violence?  What is wrong with us?  Why are you Rightwing Whackos so intent on proliferating the media with such horror, in some juvenile attempt to "get back at the lefties" for the prison abuse scandal?  THIS ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS. THESE ARE CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, ON BOTH SIDES.  NOBODY IS RIGHT OR WRONG, EVERYTHING IS JUST UGLY.  I'm so angry right now.  God, sometimes its really hard to be alive in the world...

						   Dear Douchey Ravers Outside My Apartment,  "SEPPUKU" is defined as "ceremonial suicide, by ripping open the abdomen with a dagger or knife, formerly practiced in Japan by members of the warrior class, when disgraced or sentenced to death."  Okay, so to you gangwar drunken club kid idiots from the Glass Kat who like to play out your silly rapstar-wannabe drama in front of my apartment on Friday and Saturday nights between the hours of midnight and 3 am, take a page from the book of our ancestors in the far east and fucking kill yourselves in an honorable, dignified manner.   I mean, I admit that--at first--I found some amount of fascination in your silly little red-bull-and-vodka fueled "duels", but now that shit is just getting old. Just because you rent a stretched out Hummer limo that has "Harold's Limo Rentals" stenciled all over the sides doesn't meen you have free licencse to wander around in front of my building at all hours of the morning engaging in pointless, meathead-ish battles with cocaine addicts and nightclub bouncers.  And quit leaving those stupid rave postcards announcing "Bliss World '04" all over everyone's cars and doorsteps.  I--along with the other residents of my building--would prefer it if you relegated your actions and movements to the appropriate and deserving confines of Ruby Skye, 1015 Folsom and the hallways of your high school.

						   Al-Qaeda, in retaliation for the recent prison abuse photos, has allegedly captured and beheaded an American soldier.  The gruesome  urlLink story here .  First of all, this is just another tragic reminder of the disgusting mess we're in over there.  And, before you start hearing all the Wingnuts howling about how much more brutal and despicable Al-Qaeda is than us, remember--they're COMPARING us to Al-Qaeda.  Which, to me, should negate their whole argument.  Of course Al-Qaeda is brutal and evil and terrible--but remember, we're not supposed to be.  It IS possible to be outraged both by what we did to their prisoners and what they've done to ours.  Both are brutal reminders of the cost of this war--here and elsewhere...  I hope this all goes away soon...

						   President Bush recently described Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's job performance as "superb".

						    urlLink I just don't even know where to begin ...  So, apparently the US Justice Department has "cracked" down on popular Southern restaurant the "Cracker Barrel" for its alleged discrimination of black patrons.  Imagine that--the "Cracker" Barrel, discriminating against African-Americans.    I'm surprised the restaurant didn't try to defend itself with something like, "Well, actually the discrimination is just another facet of our intended ambiance of old-timey southern tradition".  Bring the kids, have some old-style southern molasses and throw fried chicken at the darkies eating in their segregated feeding area!  Yee-haw!  Sometimes it's hard to believe we're living in the 21st Century.  If you'd like to share any thoughts or insults with the Cracker Barrel, you can easily do so  urlLink here .

						   While I agree with a lot of his politics, I'm often annoyed by the personality of Michael Moore.  I suspect that he takes too much personal satisfaction in his celebrity status, which can often taint the points he's trying to make.  He let's his personal differences and prejudices get in the way of his argument, and he often gives progressive intellectuals a bad rep.    However, I fully support his right and freedom as an artist to make his films, write his books and speak his mind.  This is supposedly a free society and--as such--we should all be allowed to voice our opinions.  In Mr. Moore's case, his opinions--even when motivated by emotional or personal feelings--are most always supported by impenetrable fact and proof, which is the essential reason his work is so popular.  You can't deny that which you can see.  Michael Moore's latest documentary--entitled "Fahrenheit 911"--is a critical examination of the relationship between the Bush family and Saudi Arabian royalty--some of which includes his ties to the bin Laden family.  In the wake of 9-11, especially considering Bush's decision to adopt the role of World Protector, I think it's fair to question the implicit hypocricy and shadiness surrounding Bush's own financial ties with the very people who might have been responsible for those horrendous attacks (remember, 3/4 of the terrorists flying those planes were Saudi citizens, not Afghani and certainly not Iraqi).    The Walt Disney Company has announced that they will block their company Miramax from distributing Mr. Moore's new film.  While they cite the potentially polarizing politics of the film as their reason, I think this little tidbit ( urlLink from the article in the NYTimes ) is particularly interesting:   Mr. Moore's agent, Ari Emanuel, said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, asked him last spring to pull out of the deal with Miramax. Mr. Emanuel said Mr. Eisner expressed particular concern that it would endanger tax breaks Disney receives for its theme park, hotels and other ventures in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor.  "Michael Eisner asked me not to sell this movie to Harvey Weinstein; that doesn't mean I listened to him," Mr. Emanuel said. "He definitely indicated there were tax incentives he was getting for the Disney corporation and that's why he didn't want me to sell it to Miramax. He didn't want a Disney company involved."   Mr. Moore's films and books have been consistently profitable--the reason he's continually allowed to create such provacative art.  So for a company with as much influence and media power as Disney to censor him, for purely political purposes, is a real tragedy in our "Democracy".  If you don't like what Michael Moore has to say, don't go to his movies.  That's the point--we as Americans should be able to decide for ourselves what we choose to experience.  We shouldn't have corporations making that choice for us...

						   Well should or shouldn't they "Bring It On"?     Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On'  WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.  (via  urlLink The Onion )

						   ( urlLink from The Onion  -- again, we find the truth in the fake news...)   Why do we purport to be fighting in the name of liberating the Iraqi people when we have no interest in violations of human rights—as evidenced by our habit of looking the other way when they occur in China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Syria, Burma, Libya, and countless other countries? Why, of all the brutal regimes that regularly violate human rights, do we only intervene militarily in Iraq? Because the violation of human rights is not our true interest here. We just say it is as a convenient means of manipulating world opinion and making our cause seem more just.  That is exactly the sort of thing I should not say right now.  This also is not the time to ask whether diplomacy was ever given a chance. Or why, for the last 10 years, Iraq has been our sworn archenemy, when during the 15 years preceding it we traded freely in armaments and military aircraft with the evil and despotic Saddam Hussein. This is the kind of question that, while utterly valid, should not be posed right now.  And I certainly will not point out our rapid loss of interest in the establishment of democracy in Afghanistan once our fighting in that country was over. We sure got out of that place in a hurry once it became clear that the problems were too complex to solve with cruise missiles.  That sort of remark will simply have to wait until our boys are safely back home.  Here's another question I won't ask right now: Could this entire situation have been avoided in the early 1990s had then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie not been given sub rosa instructions by the Bush Administration to soft-pedal a cruel dictator? Such a question would be tantamount to sedition while our country engages in bloody conflict. Just think how hurtful that would be to our military morale. I know I couldn't fight a war knowing that was the talk back home.  Is this, then, the appropriate time for me to ask if Operation Iraqi Freedom is an elaborate double-blind, sleight-of-hand misdirection ploy to con us out of inconvenient civil rights through Patriot Acts I and II? Should I wonder whether this war is just a means of distracting the country while its economy bucks and lurches toward the brink of a full-blown depression? No and no.  True patriots know that a price of freedom is periodic submission to the will of our leaders—especially when the liberties granted us by the Constitution are at stake. What good is our right to free speech if our soldiers are too demoralized to defend that right, thanks to disparaging remarks made about their commander-in-chief by the Dixie Chicks?  When the Founding Fathers authored the Constitution that sets forth our nation's guiding principles, they made certain to guarantee us individual rights and freedoms. How dare we selfishly lay claim to those liberties at the very moment when our nation is in crisis, when it needs us to be our most selfless? We shame the memory of Thomas Jefferson by daring to mention President Bush's outright lies about satellite photos that supposedly prove Iraq is developing nuclear weapons.  At this difficult time, President Bush needs my support. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld needs my support. Vice-President Dick Cheney needs my support. It is not my function as a citizen in a participatory democracy to question our leaders. And to exercise my constitutional right—nay, duty—to do so would be un-American.

						   Today the "liberal media" is rapturously trumpeting the great news: Bush has handed sovereignty back over to Iraq TWO DAYS EARLY!!!  Bush was doing his usual grinning, playing the proud father, scribbling ridiculous notes about "Freedom Reigning".  Um, what exactly did we do yesterday?  We signed some documents, we got  urlLink Bremer and other senior officials the hell out of the country before they got bombed , and left behind over 130,000 troops (while calling up  urlLink thousands of our Involuntary Reserve ), soldiers are being executed by insurgents, things are less stable by the day.  Are they serious?  We basically stole a nerdy kid's toy, stomped all over it and broke it, then gave it back to them.  The big "handover" ceremony Bush has been touting for months now took about five minutes and happened in complete secrecy.  "Thank you Baghdad, we love you!  Good night!"  From the Washington Post:   Although Bremer's document stated that the interim government "will assume the complete sovereignty on behalf of the Iraqi people," it will still lack many of hallmarks of other sovereign nations. More than 130,000 U.S. troops will remain, with wide latitude to mount combat operations and detain Iraqis. A temporary constitution will restrict the interim government's power largely to the areas of basic civil administration and preparations for national elections scheduled for January. The country's oil revenue will be subject to international oversight. American personnel will continue to work out of Hussein's Republican Palace. And the government itself is supposed to be in power for only seven months, until national elections are held.    (snip)   President Bush, speaking in Istanbul at a NATO summit meeting, called it "a day of great hope for Iraqis and a day that terrorist enemies hoped never to see."   "The Iraqi people have their country back," Bush declared. "We have kept our word."   Apparently "our word" was fucking up their country beyond repair then bailing when things got tough so we wouldn't look any worse for the election than we already do.  Indeed, the "terrorist enemies" we surely thwarted yesterday by the secret signing of the meaningless documents.  Osama was crying, I'm sure...

						   Hey kiddies.  Went to see Beulah, Stratford 4 and dios perform at the Fillmore on Saturday night--a great show.  dios, a young new band from Southern California, was a little green, but sounded fantastic.  They've got a nice Beach Boys sound that the crowd really seemed to warm up to once the guys got into the groove.  Or, maybe once the lead singer got sufficiently drunk (he was chugging beer throughout the show--I think I counted 7).  Really good band, keep an eye out for them.  I missed Stratford 4--I was busy enjoying the upstairs area of The Fillmore.  For any of you who've never been to The Fillmore--it is without a doubt the coolest music venue I've ever been to.  If you're in SF and there's a show playing, I highly recommend checking it out.    Beulah.  Man, these guys fucking rocked.  Originally from the Bay Area, Beulah is one of those indie rock bands that have been around for awhile, quietly making their excellent music without too much attention from anyone.  As a result, they're unfortunately breaking up this summer (this was their last Bay Area performance), which is real tragedy.  They sounded so good, so tight on stage--go buy any of their four albums.  Their sound is really accessible, endlessly catchy.  You'll thank me.  I'll be back later with some more political posting, but I'm a little busy right now...

						   It's currently 3:04 in the morning and I just got home from the screening.  I'm exhausted, but I'd like to get my thoughts about the film down while they're still fresh and flowing through my head.  First off, this was a remarkable film and should be viewed by every American--no matter what their political beliefs--who holds any opinion about the war currently going on in Iraq.  Fahrenheit 9/11 actually feels more like 2 films.  There was the film Moore was making prior to the war in Iraq and the film he made after the war begun.  The first hour of the film swiftly brings us through the election fiasco, Bush's alleged ignorance of terror warnings while taking ample vacation, Bush's questionable response to the attacks once they occurred, Bush's political favors for his Saudi business buddies, etc--for me, all these issue are equivalent to Clinton's infidelity--dated and no longer really relevant.  Anyone with even the slightest understanding of global economics and modern business acknowledges that Saudi Arabia is heavily invested in this country and is therefore going to hold a certain amount of political sway.  From all the reviews and reactions to this film I've currently read, I think people are getting way too caught up in the most insignificant points and details Moore presents in the film.  About an hour in, Fahrenheit 9/11 becomes one of the most brutally moving, angering, enlightening, honest, sad, horrifying and absolutely important films in history.  This is an historic film, no question about it.  There are images, sequences and scenes in this film that are nothing short of unforgettable.  Please don't let yourself be so simple as to fall into the trap of turning this movie into a contest of who's right and who's wrong.  Moore has an agenda, there's no doubt about it--he even admits it.  He's about as objective as Fox News.  But--the difference is--he's right about the important stuff.  We are sending our countrymen and women to die in a war that has yet to be adequately justified.  We--to at least some degree--were deceived by our leaders.  Many of these leaders are clearly of questionable competence.  These are the points the film so successfully makes.  You can disagree with these things, you can argue until you're blue in the face about the semantics, keep justifying your original belief, blind to the mounting evidence of its falsehood.  But I challenge you--go see the movie.  Then form your own opinion.  Don't just dismiss this film as the work of some nutty America-hating egomaniac showboat. Otherwise, don't say a word about it.  You didn't bother to watch it, then don't try to discredit it.  That's like being in a debate, then trying to disprove a point your opponent has yet to make.  And reading about it in papers and magazines and internet sites and then parroting your favorite media outlet's opinion--that don't count.  Go see the movie, then come talk to me about it.    Go see the Iraqi bodies.  Go see the American soldiers' bodies.  Go see the effect on the parents of a fallen soldier.  Go see what our own media is too sanitized to show you--which, sadly, is the truth.  If you have seen the movie, please, I welcome your comments and opinions.  If you haven't seen it, don't be an idiot and argue a point that you patently can't make.  Go see it.  I dare you.

						   Well, I'm signing off for now.  I'll be back tomorrow with a F911 review and whatever I feel like saying about my weekend.  Tonight I'm just lounging and cleaning up around the apartment, then going to see the midnight showing of the movie.  Tomorrow an early party at 5, then going to see Beulah, Stratford 4 and dios at the Fillmore--so stoked.  Keep it tight, bitches.

						   Okay, I've got tickets to go see the midnight showing of the much ballyhooed (YES!- always wanted to use that phrase) new film from Michael Moore, "Fahrenheit 9-11".  I'm kind of bummed about having to go at midnight, but they were the only tickets still available as of 9am this morning.  I'm going to post a complete review of the film tomorrow, but I'd like to say a few things before seeing it.  1.  I'm going in with a wide open mind.  There's this common misconception among Rightwingers that all of us liberals worship the sacred ground Mikey Moore walks upon.  This is not true.  As I've said before, I agree with his opinions, but not so much his methods.  He often lets his personality overshadow the strenth of his points, which are then dismissed because people get hung up on what an ass he is.    2.  I'm judging this as both a film and political message.  People have criticized Moore for making a movie intended to serve a political motivation (getting Bush out of office).  Personally, I think this is valid.  This isn't the evening news, its a movie that you're paying to go see.  He therefore has the same right to state his opinion as you have to get up and walk out if you don't like it.  Considering the ineptitude of our media, I'm glad that we even get an opinion like Michael Moore's--as our regular news outlets seem to bend over for the Bush Administration every chance they get.  3.  At the end of the day, I'm not expecting this movie to shatter everything I've--or anyone else--have ever known about the world or politics or George W. Bush.  This isn't going to be the reason he gets booted in the election--his own record is.  Moore will probably take credit, but this is just a movie and the majority of the people who see will either already agree with him or blindly hate him so much that no matter what they see, they'll dismiss it as garbage.  4.  I am the Walrus.

						    "Part of our problem is a lot of the press are afraid to travel very much, so they sit in Baghdad and they publish rumors. And rumors are plentiful. Our own media have some responsibility to try to present a balanced picture, instead of always gravitating for the sensational. And the violence is certainly sensational."    -- Dept. Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz on our "the problems in Iraq"  By the end of yesterday, over 100 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after insurgent violence erupted across Iraq.  As of today, over 46 journalists have been killed in Iraq.    This is just another example of how incredibly out of touch the Bushies are with both our people and reality.  Wolfowitz is one of the men primarily responsible for getting us into this war in the first place, so I find his words both disgustingly insensitive--and characteristically arrogant.  In a rare and surprising display of not-being-a-moron,  urlLink Wolfowitz apologizes .

That's right, I've booked a gig opening for singer/songwriter David Weatherman at the  urlLink P&H Cafe  in Midtown Memphis.  I don't know much about Mr. Weatherman, but I've spoken with him on the phone and he seems like a fine chap.  I'll be doing about 20-30 minutes of comedy before he goes on, so be sure to come see my act--its truly a "San Francisco Treat".    The show starts around 7:30 pm.  P&H is on Madison.  They've got good food and cheap beer, so be sure to come out and bring some friends (especially if they're Republican).  More details to come...  UPDATE:  The Show is FREE, so cheapies need not be discouraged to attend. :)

						   Last night I performed at  urlLink The Canvas Cafe and Gallery  over at 9th and Lincoln in the Sunset District.  A really great show, thanks to everyone who came out (and videotaped!).    Overall, my set went well.  I did some new matieral (always scary), some of which worked, some of which didn't.  However, I'd say the highlight had to be when a passing crackhead outside pressed himself against the window next to the stage while I was performing.  I had a little fun with it, and luckily the crowd dug my jokes about his failed attempts at Scientology and his involvement in the cult rituals that were about to begin in GG Park, once the sun had completely set.  Later on, during another comic's set, the same vagrant strolled into the club and almost got into a fight with a high-school-aged comic named Edwin Lee.  It's not often we get to see skirmishes at comedy shows, so it was pretty exciting.  I'll be performing at the Canvas again in July--on the 13th and 27th.  Come check it out, maybe L. Ron will show up again...

						   I'm not afraid to say it--I love Bill Clinton.  In my opinion, he's one of the brightest and best presidents this country has been lucky enough to have.  Am I gonna read his 950 page biography?  Probably not.  But I think all the attention he's once again getting in the press is kind of funny.    First, I love how much of a douchebag Matt Drudge is -- notice how he's dedicated  urlLink over one third of his site  to listing every city and region the Clinton book is not flying off the shelves in, as if that somehow means Clinton has failed at something.  Remember, Matt Drudge was the person really responsible for breaking the whole Clinton-Lewinsky "scandal".  Drudge owes everything he has to The Clenis.  And I find it somewhat remarkable that he still takes such shameless pride in detracting from the man wherever he can, no matter how mundane.  Okay, people -- let's break this down real simple:  Clinton got a blowjob.  A BJ.  A hummer, if you will.  He was president--the most powerful man in the world--and he got a blowjob.  The Right Wing STILL has not been able to let this go, its as if they wake up each morning, furious that the man would be so sick as to misuse his presidential power to get his presidential tally whacked.  Meanwhile, Wingnuts are so wrapped up in their righteous indignation that they are somehow able to ignore/not care when their own "leaders" are wrapped up in scandal.  Take GOP Senate Candidate Jack Ryan, for example.  His divorce papers to actress Jeri Ryan have just been unsealed and it looks like  urlLink she claims he was forcing her to attend sex clubs with him and constantly trying to convince her to have public sex with him in these clubs .  But the Righties (like Rick Santorum) are still fundraising for this guy?  What the fuck?  (And since this is listed on the other half of his website, Matt Drudge apparently isn't quick to see the irony here).  And lastly, while we're on Clinton and Drudge, yesterday Drudge ran some "shocking expose" photo of clinton wearing a "mystery bracelet" (its a simple woven bracelet--Drudge has since taken the photos down).  Well, you can  urlLink read here  about where the scandalous "mystery bracelet" actually came from:   "I went there [to Colombia] and met these unbelievable kids from a village on the edge of the rainforest where the narco-traffickers are dominant," he says. "They sang and danced for peace and I fell in love with these kids. I asked them to perform at the White House one Christmas. They came with the culture minister, a magnificently attractive woman called Consuelo. The bad guys hated these kids because they made them look like what they are. The guerillas couldn't kill these children, so they murdered her ... I can still hardly talk about this.  "Two years ago they asked me back and I said, 'I'll come, but you've got to bring those kids to see me.' So I turn up -- and the children greeted me at the airport, along with the new culture minister -- the niece of the murdered woman. And they gave me this bracelet, which I've never taken off."

						    urlLink Here's an interesting--and somewhat terrifying--article about an upcoming book entitled Imperial Hubris .  The book--written anonymously by a senior US intelligence official--is apparently and unfliching and pessimistic evaluation of the state of the War on Terror.  Some of the interesting bits from the article:   "What I think we're seeing in al-Qaida is a change of generation," he said."The people who are leading al-Qaida now seem a lot more professional group.   "They are more bureaucratic, more management competent, certainly more literate. Certainly, this generation is more computer literate, more comfortable with the tools of modernity. I also think they're much less prone to being the Errol Flynns of al-Qaida. They're just much more careful across the board in the way they operate."   As for weapons of mass destruction, he thinks that if al-Qaida does not have them already, it will inevitably acquire them.    (snip)   Anonymous, who published an analysis of al-Qaida last year called Through Our Enemies' Eyes, thinks it quite possible that another devastating strike against the US could come during the election campaign, not with the intention of changing the administration, as was the case in the Madrid bombing, but of keeping the same one in place.   "I'm very sure they can't have a better administration for them than the one they have now," he said.   "One way to keep the Republicans in power is to mount an attack that would rally the country around the president."    (snip)   He said: "It's going to take 10,000-15,000 dead Americans before we say to ourselves: 'What is going on'?"   Indeed...

						    urlLink This article is a MUST READ !  George W. Bush has proposed legislation that would require the mental health screenings  for all US citizens .  I hate to make the obvious joke, but is he crazy?  What exactly could motivate Mr. Bush to propose this type of Orwellian doctrine of evaluating the mental/emotional faculties of this country's citizens (mostly its children)?  Drug companies, of course!  Apparently we don't have enough Americans on Prozac and Dexadrine and Ambien and Ritalin and Adderral and Zoloft and Pfizer and Eli Lilly.    This is terrifying, sad and staggeringly wrong.  Of course, our "guardians of democracy" in the Media hardly mention it--no, no, there's too many juicy reliving the Clinton/Lewinsky affair stories to run something so mundane and boring as the future of our civil rights and liberties...

						   In the classy high-brow "New York Times", Philip Shenon writes  urlLink this piece about the accuracy and impending scrutiny of Michael Moore's new film "Fahrenheit 911 ".  He points out that--because of its inflammatory message--conservatives will undoubtedly be relentless in their evaluation and criticism of the facts stated by Mr. Moore.    The journalist suggests that most of Moore's facts will check out, but seems skeptical about Moore's claim that the Bush administration pulled strings to get Saudi Nationals (who happened to be named bin Laden) out of the country during the period when all air traffic was still grounded.    From the New York Times:   Mr. Moore may also be criticized for the way he portrays the evacuation of the extended bin Laden family from the United States after Sept. 11. As the Sept. 11 commission has found, the Saudi government was able to pull strings at senior levels of the Bush administration to help the bin Ladens leave the United States. But while the film clearly suggests that the flights occurred at a time when all air traffic was grounded immediately after the attacks ("Even Ricky Martin couldn't fly," Mr. Moore says over video of the singer wandering in an airport lobby), the Sept. 11 commission said in a report this April that there was "no credible evidence that any chartered flights of Saudi Arabian nationals departed the United States before the reopening of national airspace" and that the F.B.I. had concluded that no one aboard the flights was involved in Sept. 11.   But while fact-checking his own article about fact-checking (for the New York Times), he must have missed this:  From the  urlLink Saint Petersburg Times :   TAMPA - Two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, with most of the nation's air traffic still grounded, a small jet landed at Tampa International Airport, picked up three young Saudi men and left.   The men, one of them thought to be a member of the Saudi royal family, were accompanied by a former FBI agent and a former Tampa police officer on the flight to Lexington, Ky. The men, one of them thought to be a member of the Saudi royal family, were accompanied by a former FBI agent and a former Tampa police officer on the flight to Lexington, Ky.  The Saudis then took another flight out of the country. The two ex-officers returned to TIA a few hours later on the same plane.  For nearly three years, White House, aviation and law enforcement officials have insisted the flight never took place and have denied published reports and widespread Internet speculation about its purpose.  But now, at the request of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, TIA officials have confirmed that the flight did take place and have supplied details.   So not only did the flight take place, but the adminstration lied about it.  Clinton got a blowjob, fibbed about it and was nearly executed for it...  Sigh...

						   I saw a super-duper rock and fucking roll show last night at Popscene, which is conveniently located about 100 yards from my front door.  After having to wait in line and suffer the despondent, jaded glares of what seemed like every hipster in San Francisco, I was able to secure my entrance into the crowded club.  I was particularly excited because I knew this would be my last chance to see  urlLink The Killers  in a venue that small, at a price that cheap (cover was $5).  The Killers have been dominating my iPod for a couple of months now, but their first LP "Hot Fuss" was just released this past Tuesday.  They sound a like a band from Factory Records in the early 80's--synthesized poprock.  What makes their music so righteous is the driving and downright dangerous rythym of their guitars and drums.  Their songs speed along furiously, but still somehow manage to maintain catchiness.    You should definitely pick up a copy of the new album--the songs are all pretty great.  Also, I'm expecting them to be touring heavy to promote it, so look out for them...

						   The time was not long ago when an impoverished-but-discriminating beer-lover could walk into most any modest-but-friendly drinking establishment and order up a pint of Pabst Blue Ribbon for the economical price of dirt cheap.  Usually less than two bucks.     But that time is rapidly coming to an end.   Any long-time Pabst aficionado will undoubtedly bemoan the miserable—and fairly recent—increase in the price of this longtime staple of bankrupt beer-drinkers.  While more bars and stores are now offering this once-obscure brand of swill, the prices are now reaching upwards of $4 a beer in some places.  This is blasphemy.  Madness.  Oppression.  And it must be stopped.   But first we must understand how it began.  Why is the price of the Peebs suddenly on the rise?  Is it a reflection of our struggling economy?  Probably not—Pabst was even cheap in the Great Depression.   Inflation?  Inflation happens slowly over time, while the price of Pabst has skyrocketed in the past few years.  Is there a recent Pabst shortage?  No, they’re brewing just as much of their sweet nectar as always, so if it’s not the supply…   It’s because of stupid hipsters everywhere.  You hijacked our beer, you pretentious little posers.  Somewhere along the way, one of your Retrofitted leaders decided that drinking cheap beer is—huh huh—ironic.  And your hilarious 80’s T-Shirts (wow, it says “Teen Wolf”) alone are a testament to your ilk’s borderline obsessive love of irony.      But let’s get something straight—Pabst Blue Ribbon is neither cool nor ironic.  It’s cheap, intoxicating and surprisingly drinkable—which are the reasons people like myself were drinking it when you hipsters were still back in the suburbs, swilling down Bud Light at Dave Matthews Concerts.     There was a time when being a man sitting in a bar with a cold Pabst meant something, when it said something.  It said, “I like to party and I ain’t got a lot of dough—so if you ladies wanna tie one on and go make out back at my friend Gus’ basement apartment, then rock and roll.”  It was a badge we wore—a shield protecting us from wretched barflys who want talk about feelings and “Sex and the City” over martinis someone just bought them.   But now, ever since you stupid hipsters reduced the Blue Ribbon to just another one of your Urban Outfitter accessories, holding a Pabst says nothing.  It says, “I guess I’ll drink this ‘cause that’s what everyone else is drinking”.   Oh, I know what you stupid hipsters are thinking right now: “Dude, I drink Pabst ‘cause its hella cheap!”  No.  Wrong, you don’t.  You have no problem throwing down $200 for a pair of Diesel Jeans or $500 for your hipster-accessories-not-included iPods; so don’t even tell me you prefer Pabst for its price.  Just admit it, you think it’s cool.   But you know, if you think drinking cheap, shitty beer is cool or ironic or whatever, that’s your prerogative—and of no concern to me.  My question is why couldn’t you stupid hipsters have picked some other TRULY shitty beer—like Red Dog or Blue Ox or Cold Steel—to canonize and subsequently spike the price of?  Why’d you have to go and fuck with tradition?  Do you automatons have any concept of how many blue-collared good people out there have been enjoying Pabst Blue Ribbon for decades prior to your discovery and bastardization of its glorious hops?      I beseech you, stupid hipsters of the world—find another way to get trashed at your indie rock shows, impress your friends with your sense of irony by showcasing another beer at your “raw space” apartment, assert your cynical rejection of mainstream culture by imbibing some other non-major-label beer.  Drink Miller High Life or Colt 45 until you’re stinking drunk and passed out in a puddle of your puked up veggie burritos, I don’t care.      But I want my beer back.  And I want it cheap—like Fredrick Pabst intended.

						   (from the  urlLink NY Daily news )   Heated exchange at 'Fahrenheit'?    Give Fox News Channel star Bill O'Reilly credit for even attending Monday night's lefty celeb-glutted premiere of Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" - even if he walked out of the 110-minute Bush-bashing movie halfway through.  Only last week on his syndicated radio show, O'Reilly likened Moore to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels - author of the "Big Lie" theory of political communication.  As O'Reilly explained to his radio audience, "Joseph Goebbels was the minister of propaganda for the Nazi regime and whose very famous quote was, 'If you tell a lie long enough, it becomes the truth.'"  So it was a tad awkward when O'Reilly, trying to sneak out of the Ziegfeld Theater and almost at the exit, came jowl to jowl with Moore himself.  Busted!  "Don't you want to stay and watch the whole film?" the director demanded.  A Lowdown spy reports that O'Reilly blushed, shook Moore's hand and muttered something about having to "tape something," and then slunk off into the night.  But "The O'Reilly Factor" tapes in the afternoon, hours before it airs at 8 and 11 p.m. - and well before Monday night's premiere.  Moore - who didn't return Lowdown's call for comment - was apparently skeptical. When his wife, Kathleen Glynn, came inside the theater a moment later, the filmmaker excitedly repeated O'Reilly's alibi in a scoffing tone.  Yesterday, a Fox News spokesman explained: "The movie started 40 minutes late, and Bill had a previous commitment to go to."  The flack added that O'Reilly was simply confirming Moore's booking on his Fox News show next week and that O'Reilly had already asked "Fahrenheit 9/11" producer Harvey Weinstein's office for a screener.  Again, problematic: A source close to the movie says no videotapes are being given out to anyone under any circumstances.  Surely not a little white lie!   Oh, the irony...

						    urlLink Here's a review of "America-hater" Michael Moore's new film from FoxNews .  I repeat, from  FOX NEWS .  FOX "Bill O'Reilly-Fair and Balanced long as its Rightwing Propaganda-We Hate Liberals" NEWS.  An excerpt:   As much as some might try to marginalize this film as a screed against President George Bush, "F9/11" — as we saw last night — is a tribute to patriotism, to the American sense of duty, and at the same time a indictment of stupidity and avarice.   Now, I already know what's going to happen when this film is released next weekend.  People like myself are going to see it and love it and appreciate the fact that somewhere out there is a voice of truth and reason.  People in the middle are going to see it and become people like me.  And people on the right aren't going to bother to see it and call it an abomination and persecute all those who do view such filth.    However, I offer those who see things differently than me a simple challenge:  see the fucking movie.  Form your own opinions.  Think for yourselves for a change.  Don't just parrot what Bill O'Reilly says (he apparently left after 30 minutes).

						   Sometimes, it's hard for me to decide which Bush Administration official I like the least--or I should say, fear the most.  Of course there's Bush himself, but I don't really dislike him so much as question his competence and slightly pity him.  There's Cheney--a Darth Vader-eque little man who just oozes the potential for evil.  Rumsfeld--the crochety old sonofabitch angry, "Hey you kids get off my lawn!" guy.    But I think--at the end of the day--I gotta go with Ashcroft.  He who believes that black cats are a sign of the devil.   urlLink He who is quite possibly this country's WORST singer/songerwriter  (if you haven't seen this yet, its hysterica--I highly recommmend clicking the link).  He who authored The Patriot Act--which is the single greatest blow to civil liberties since slavery.   urlLink Paul Krugman writes an excellent account of Ashcroft's "performance" in this morning's New York Times .  This is today's required reading...

						   So, as you probably know, Michael Moore has a controversial new film called "Fahrenheit 911" coming to theaters at the end of the month.  The film--a critical look at the Bush Administration--has been all over the press because of the controversy surrounding its distribution.  It's no secret the right wing does not want people to see this movie.  In an election year, a movie like this could do infinite damage to the already suffering Bush campaign.  So, its with little surprise, that the Anti-Moore attack from the GOP has begun.   urlLink This seemingly innocuous group called "Move America Forward"  (how original) is campaigning to boycott any theatre (there are currently over 700) that plans on exhibiting the film.  They blatantly distort facts about the film and Moore himself, claiming the film is "bashing America" and trying to "Bring down the government".  Nothing too surprising, right?  Some concerned Republicans doing their best to keep Moore's liberal agenda out of the minds of their fellow Americans.  Well, actually, when you dig a little deeper, you find out who's really behind this bogus site:   urlLink Russo, Marsh & Rogers  -- a PR firm right here in lovely San Francisco (of course having strong ties to the GOP).   urlLink More about them here .  So here we have a political party utilizing public relations to set up a bogus website to intimidate theater owners into not running a politically-sensitive film.  This is worse than censorship--this is blatant Orwellian facism.

						   Last night I caught an excellent show at Cobb's Comedy Club in lovely North Beach.  Though my friend and fellow comedian Jasper Redd was hosting the show and some dude named Chris Hardwick was the opener, I was really there for one reason and one reason only--Mr. Patton Oswalt.  I've seen Patton perform 3 times in the past 6 months and he's been consistently funny every time.  From his Nick Nolte impressions to his theory that George W. Bush is actually an evil supervillian straight out of Marvel Comics--Patton delivers his jokes with an intelligence and anger that simply make you laugh out loud.  If you get the chance to see this guy perform, I can't recommend him highly enough.   urlLink His website is here .  The big surprise of the night for me, though, was opening comedian Chris Hardwick.  Before the show started, I really had no idea who this guy was.  Then he mentioned hosting a show on MTV and I remembered, "oh yeah...the guy from Singled Out".  At first, I thought he was just gonna be another LA cheesebag comedian, but he was incredibly smart and funny.  Then I find out he (and his friend) are the dudes behind  urlLink Rodeohead  (which I posted on here last week).  Then I remember that he is Chris Hardwick, son of Billy Hardwick, owner of my favorite bowling alley in Memphis.  Then I realize this dude went to Christian Brothers High School--oooohhhh, THAT Chris Hardwick.  Small world I guess.  But his song/slide show called, "American Dinosaur"--fucking CLASSIC.  God, I wish there was a video of that somewhere (cough cough).  Just imagine a Toby Keith song playing over an uber-patriotic montage of President Bush standing in front of flags, etc--then replace George W. Bush with dinosaurs.  Pure hilarity.  I guess it doesn't translate into text that well, but take my word for it.   urlLink Check out Chris' site here .  Good times.

						   I'm going to be performing as a part of the San Francisco comedy showcase at  urlLink 50 Mason Comedy Club  on Saturday night, June 19th.  Admission is 7 bucks, but I swear I'll make it worth it.  The set is really coming together and I'm excited to be performing in a venue that will NOT feature some jaded hipster manning a screeching espresso machine.  50 Mason is actually a pretty swanky place--at least inside.  Its located right near Mason and Market, in the heart of San Francisco's charming Tenderloin district--so if you need to pick up some PCP or crack after the show, the location couldn't be better.  The show goes from 8-10pm, but I suggest arriving a few minutes early to get a good seat.  Also, you can bring your own booze--they have cups, ice and mixers available for purchase.  I'm working on getting the gig videotaped, so if I don't bomb video copies might be available for my Southern readers.  If I do bomb, I'll tell my Southern readers the gig went great, but the camera fucked up.

						   If you're not already a huge fan of Wes Anderson (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums), then you've either a) not seen his movies or b) have no taste and should be strapped to a chair watching Charles In Charge reruns for the rest of your waking life.  Anderson has proven three times--with each of his films--that he's one of the most entertaining, original and talented filmmakers alive.  His movies balance comedy and tragedy, love and frustration with a precision that few directors are capable of.  And the real phenomenon about Wes Anderson is this--he appears to be getting better with each picture he makes.  His newest film is called The Life Aquatic--a movie starring the incomparable Bill Murray as Steve Zissou, a "Jacques Cesteau"-esque marine biologist TV personality.   urlLink These three early reviews  from the film's first preview screening are already saying Bill Murray might FINALLY get the Oscar he deserves--and they all seem to be rapturously in love with this film.  It comes out later this year--keep your eyes peeled...

						    urlLink Great Newsweek piece here .   When George W. Bush makes his D-Day anniversary visit to the Normandy beaches on Sunday, we’re going to hear a lot of well-honed speeches trying to compare the righteous combat forced on us in World War II with the war of choice we’ve entered into in Iraq. But only speechmakers from coddled, comfortable backgrounds who’ve never heard a shot fired in anger, much less seen “dead men by mass production,” would dare use the blood of those who died at Normandy 60 years ago to try to cleanse their conscience of those dying in Iraq today.  The United States entered World War II, as it had entered World War I, to defeat a proven aggressor and bring the war to an end. The Bush administration actually won its righteous war, in Afghanistan after the aggression of September 11, 2001. But that victory came too quickly, it seems, for our leaders to get much satisfaction from it. So they sent our kids to Iraq. And what is the goal there today, now that the reasons we were given at first have proved to be grand delusions? To spread democracy? To extirpate the very idea of terrorism? To work the will of God? Sixty years ago, those who thought they could teach the world how to live the only right way, which was their way, and launched unprovoked wars claiming this was the only thing could do to defend their values—those were the people we called the enemy.  But let’s be clear about the soldiers. Our soldiers. Those men and women in Iraq today are, indeed, just as heroic as those at Normandy. They have been put in the wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong reasons, but that’s not their fault. They are fighting and dying and trying to build something good as soldiers, despite the most foolhardy civilian leadership in the modern history of the United States. Like any G.I. Joe in World War II, they’re making the best of a bad situation.

						   Yesterday I saw another great movie--albeit a completely different one from Napoleon Dynamite.  Yesterday I attended a screening of the new documentary called "The Corporation".  After winning the audience award from best doc at the Sundance Film Festival, the film was able to secure US distribution and--hopefully--will soon be coming to a theatre near you (this weekend was it's U.S. premiere here in San Francisco).  The Corporation is a non-political examination of the past, present and future of the institution of the corporation.  From the 14th amendment through the recent debates over the privatization of the human gene, this film takes an unflinching look at some of the dangers the corporation--more specifically, capitalism gone out of control--can present.  Now, I should say that this movie--despite being marketed as such--is really not at all similar to Michael Moore's movies.  While Moore's agenda unapologetically finds its way into nearly each frame of his films, this was a much more objective, detached and therefore more credible argument.  In fact, I cannot remember a single mention of George W. Bush (with the exception of a few seconds of footage of one of his speeches).  This is a film that trancends petty squabbling between the left and right--instead choosing to persuade its viewers to take a closer look at their world.  I cannot recommend this film enough--personally, I think it should be required viewing for every American.  We enjoy a life of privelege and comfort--but not without some cost.  We should at least know the price the transaction...   urlLink Here's the official website .   urlLink Click here to view the trailer .

						   From its ingenious credit sequence to its familiarly touching and hilarious final shot, Jared Hess' debut masterpiece "Napoleon Dynamite" is one of the most fun, watchable films to grace our screens in years.  Telling the simple story of the titular character with the perfect balance of earnest nostalgia and smirking jest, first-time director Hess has created a film that acheives is rightful cult status before the final credits even begin to roll.  This is undoubtedly one for the DVD collection, folks.      While this isn't a film so much about story as it is situation, the jist is this--Napoleon Dynamite is a dork.  He lives somewhere in Idaho in some unnamed year that could conceivably be anywhere from 1984 to the present.  He enjoys tater tots, his Trapper Keeper (in which he draws pencil sketches of mythical beasts) and trying to dodge the scorn and bullying of his peers.  While the plot isn't altogether original (dork meets other dork friend, tries to get date to dance, tries to get dork friend elected president, all the while suffering the humiliation of his family and friends, etc.), this film's strength comes in the director's pitch-perfect sense of subtle absurdity and the first-rate performance from its star--an unknown actor named Jon Heder.       Heder--along with the rest of the cast--seems to have a preternatural understanding of the irony and nuance of the character he plays.  And Heder--to his credit--just ran with it, thereby soldifying his position in the Indie Movie stratosphere--think Jason Schartzman in Rushmore or Jake Gyllenhaal in Donnie Darko.  We're going to see more of this guy.      I'm not going to spoil any of the plethora of laugh-out load moments this film boasts--but I'd like to point out how brilliant it is that the filmmakers were able to create such a consistently hilarious movie with a PG rating.  I don't think there was a single curse word uttered in the entirety of the film--and truth is, there didn't need to be.  The movie's humor comes from its innocence and earnestness--the audience all seeing just a bit of themselves in these ridiculous characters.  Even the coolest cucumber out there was a dork at some point in their life--probably their youth.  We love Napoleon because he's us at our most riciculously beautiful.  Just another dope who wants people to like his sweet skills, wants to be understood, wants to eat his tater tots in peace--a pretty good metaphor for all of us, if you ask me.  Napoleon Dynamite opens in select theatres next weekend--June 11th.  Opens nationwide sometime thereafter.

						    George W. Bush last Feburary, on Meet The Press (emphasis added):   Russert: If the Iraqis choose, however, an Islamic extremist regime, would you accept that, and would that be better for the United States than Saddam Hussein?  President Bush: They're not going to develop that. And the reason I can say that is because I'm very aware of this basic law they're writing. They're not going to develop that because right here in the Oval Office  I sat down with Mr. Pachachi and Chalabi and al-Hakim, people from different parts of the country that have made the firm commitment , that they want a constitution eventually written that recognizes minority rights and freedom of religion.    George W. Bush yesterday , Rose Garden press conference:   Q Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chalabi is an Iraqi leader that's fallen out of favor within your administration. I'm wondering if you feel that he provided any false information, or are you particularly --   THE PRESIDENT: Chalabi?   Q Yes, with Chalabi.   THE PRESIDENT: My meetings with him were very brief. I mean, I think I met with him at the State of the Union and just kind of working through the rope line, and he might have come with a group of leaders.  But I haven't had any extensive conversations with him.    (via  urlLink Atrios )

Her story is a very good lesson in modern political journalism and one would hope our media would learn something from it.

Take  urlLink THIS LETTER , from Al-Qaeda themselves, for example.&nbsp; Some choice excerpts:   "A group claiming to have links with al Qaeda says it is calling a truce in its Spanish operations to see if the new Madrid government would withdraw its troops from Iraq, a pan-Arab newspaper says."    &nbsp; (snip)   " The statement said it supported U.S. President George W. Bush in his reelection campaign, and would prefer him to win in November rather than the Democratic candidate John Kerry, as it was not possible to find a leader "more foolish than you (Bush), who deals with matters by force rather than with wisdom."  "   (snip)   "Kerry will kill our nation while it sleeps because he and the Democrats have the cunning to embellish blasphemy and present it to the Arab and Muslim nation as civilisation."      "Because of this we desire you (Bush) to be elected."      The group said its cells were ready for another attack and time was running out for allies of the United States."   You know, that's been one of my biggest problems with the way Bush responded to 9-11.&nbsp; He came out and made vague, Dr. Phil-esque good vs. evil statements, claiming that we were attacked by Al-Qaeda because they "Hate Freedom".  I don't think they attacked us because they "hate freedom".&nbsp; I think they attacked us for our positions in the Israeli-Palestine conflict and our military presence in their Holy Land.&nbsp; You know why I think that?&nbsp;  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY FUCKING SAID .&nbsp; Just because they're enemies and they're evil, doesn't mean they're beneath telling the truth about the political rationale behind their actions.&nbsp; Remember, the very essence of terrorism is using violence and fear to achieve a desired result.&nbsp;

						   "Naturally, the common people don't want war, but after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country."  -Hermann Goering, Hitler's Reich-Marshall at the Nuremberg Trials after WWII  (thanks Jules!)

						   When I first heard The Wrens' EP "The Meadowlands", I imagined a group of New York City hipsters, similar in appearance to the Strokes, all retro-clothes and mussed hair, strutting and sneering, drowning themselves in Jack Daniels on stage.&nbsp; So when I saw the four New Jersey natives take the stage last night at the Great American Music Hall, I was a bit confused. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  First of all, they're old.&nbsp; These guys look nothing like Julian and Co., but instead share more resemblance with, say, four "cool"&nbsp;high school teachers who play in a garage band in a last-ditch attempt to maintain some grasp on their slipping youth.&nbsp; Balding, dressed in Gap-esque buttondown shirts and non-designer jeans, The Wrens are all substance and no style.&nbsp; But the key words are "all substance". &nbsp; Their music has it all: depth, originality, catchiness and--most importantly--the fucking Rawk.&nbsp; "The Meadowlands" is a masterpiece work of post-breakup rock and roll catharsis, acerbic and savage, brutal and sad.&nbsp; Someone got their heart broken real bad--and the result is one of the altoghether finest rock albums on this seminal subject.&nbsp; If you've been dumped, this music will heal you.&nbsp; Its just the right mix of anger, honesty and resolve to move forward. &nbsp; The live show was amazing.&nbsp; The bassist/keyboard/lead singer in particular had an onstage energy that just made you want to jump around and scream with him.&nbsp; They might look old, but the Wrens could give the Strokes some much-needed lessons in Rawking. &nbsp; Particular tracks of interest are "Happy", "Hopeless" and "Boys You Won't Remember". &nbsp; Give it a listen.

						   It looks like Iraq is now the shining beacon of Democracy that George W. Bush envisioned it would be:    &nbsp;   Iyad Allawi, the new Prime Minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings.     &nbsp;   [snip]     &nbsp;   "The prisoners were against the wall and we were standing in the courtyard when the Interior Minister said that he would like to kill them all on the spot. Allawi said that they deserved worse than death - but then he pulled the pistol from his belt and started shooting them."     &nbsp;   Re-enacting the killings, one witness stood three to four metres in front of a wall and swung his outstretched arm in an even arc, left to right, jerking his wrist to mimic the recoil as each bullet was fired. Then he raised a hand to his brow, saying: "He was very close. Each was shot in the head."     &nbsp;   [snip]     &nbsp;   The Herald has established that as many as 30 people, including the victims, may have been in the courtyard. One of the witnesses said there were five or six civilian-clad American security men in a convoy of five or six late model four-wheel-drive vehicles that was shepherding Dr Allawi's entourage on the day. The US military and Dr Allawi's office refused to respond to questions about the composition of his security team. It is understood that the core of his protection unit is drawn from the US Special Forces units.   &nbsp;  Full stories  urlLink here ,  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  &nbsp;  (via  urlLink Atrios )

						   ...so, apparently, George W. Bush is a terrorist.   urlLink I just love reading stories like this .  This is the "freedom" our young soldiers are dying to protect:   A worker with the Federal Emergency Management Agency who wore an anti-Bush T-shirt at the president’s July Fourth rally in Charleston has been sent home to Texas.   Nicole Rank, who was working for FEMA in West Virginia, and her husband, Jeff, were removed from the Capitol grounds in handcuffs shortly before Bush’s speech. The pair wore T-shirts with the message “Love America, Hate Bush.”  The Ranks were ticketed for trespassing and released. They have been given summonses to appear in court, Charleston Police Lt. C.A. Vincent said Wednesday.   [snip]  Dozens of people who attended Sunday’s event wore pro-Bush T-shirts and Bush-Cheney campaign buttons, some of which were sold on the Capitol grounds outside the security screening stations.

He can also be seen on TV's "The King of Queens" (but FYI - his standup humor is MUCH different than the sanitized sitcom stuff he does on TV).  Enjoy!

						   While I regularly visit his site for quick news headlines, I normally take Matt Drudge's idiotic little editorializations for a grain of a grain of salt.  The man is like a 13 year old cheerleader in heat, breathlessly blubbering the most outrageous and moronic gossip he can muster.  But his shit last week about John Kerry and John Edwards being too "touchy-feely" and possibly "gay" was just outright lunacy.  First of all,  urlLink the pictures Drudge was talking about  were completely taken out of context--clearly the result of any normal political glad-handing and back-slapping.  Similar  urlLink examples of conservate "touchy-feelyness" can be found here .  On top of the sheer retardness of all this, Matt Drudge is HIMSELF GAY.  Why do you think he has such a problem with male affection?  Is this just a clean indication of his self hatred and repression?  Our prayers go out to him...

						    urlLink The Bushies are now suggesting we POSTPONE the November elections because "Al Qaeda might attack us".   This "Al Qaeda might attack us" bullshit has been the Bushies' bread and butter--from pushing the Patriot Act to passing tax cuts to getting their war approved to getting themselves re-elected.  When are we going to stop eating up their thinly veiled threats?  Why don't we just postpone the elections indefinitely?  You know what, who needs elections?  Bush can be president forever--otherwise who will protect us from the sinister Al Qaeda?  Only Bush and his valiant Texas Magic Sword can save us from the horrors that surely await us were we to elect another president--say, John Kerry.  Yes, if were to elect someone like Kerry, Al Qaeda would undoubtedly blow their gasket and unleash a hellish fury of terror like the world has never known.  In fact, a vote for Kerry is a vote for Terror.  Do you support Terror?  Do you?  Of course not.  So the only way to not vote for Terror is to vote for George W. Bush.

						   I had a pretty uneventful weekend.  However, I did manage to see the new Will Ferrell movie Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy.  I've been following this movie for some time now and have really been dying to see it.  Like most people, I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan and think pretty much everything the man says or does is completely hilarious.    Anchorman was good, but not great.  It was consisently funny, but rarely hilarious.  The kind of movie you're chuckling throughout, while never laughing so hard you can't breathe.  Ferrell was funny, but honestly I think he works much better in roles playing the more innocent, earnest Everyman who gets shit on and consequently freaks out type of character.  Ron Burgundy is funny, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly.    The big surprise of the movie was the Daily Show's Steve Carrell, who absolutely steals every scene he's in as nearly-retarded weatherman Brick Tamlin.  God, he was so perfect.  So funny.  Some intresting cameos, some quirky dialoge, a really funny outtakes reel during the credits: overall a pretty good movie.  I'd give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.

						   Yesterday, Tom Ridge reminded us that Osama bin Laden is getting ready to strike us again, possibly in an attempt to influence the upcoming elections.   You know, I'm really getting sick of these vague, completely pointless, "Just reminding you, America -- terrorists are out there -- they want to kill us -- better be ready" reports from the Bush administration.  We get these every so often (always conveniently timed to coincide with something in the news that's helping the Democrats).  There's never any specific information, never any credible reason for the announcement or any specific precautions we should take as a result of it.  It's getting ridiculous.    From  urlLink a good article about this in Newsday :   Watch carefully now. Something cynical is happening here.  With each new pointless warning, with each new breathless plea, those around George W. Bush are trying to link the terrorists with the Democrats.  Al-Qaida wants to "influence the American election," we are told. The terrorists hope to "pull another Spain," where the ruling party was voted out after the Madrid subway was bombed.  The implication isn't accidental, and it gets real ugly real fast: A vote for John Kerry, we are supposed to conclude, is a vote for Osama bin Laden.  (snip)  Osama doesn't endorse, whatever Karl Rove might imply.  Plus, you'd have to say that al-Qaida hasn't done too badly under George W. Bush, and not just because Bush was president during the 9/11 terror attacks.  Bin Laden is still a free man. So is bin Laden's chief deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. And so is Mullah Mohammed Omar, the supreme Taliban leader and bin Laden's most important ally.  And the war in Iraq has turned that country into a hotbed of terrorists from across the Middle East. The war and the occupation have been a rhetorical bonanza for al-Qaida and like-minded groups.  American soldiers, controlling an oil-rich Muslim country! Killing innocent civilians, leaving embittered relatives behind! The Abu Ghraib prison-torture photos!  Can't you hear the terror recruiters now?   Indeed...

We probably know exactly where he is, but we're not going to bring him to justice until it will be most politically significant.  This article disgusts me.  Read some excerpts below:   The New Republic has learned that Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs [high value targets, e.g., Bin Laden] by the election.   -- snip --  ... a White House aide told [director of Pakistani intelligence Lt. Gen.

I was really nervous about performing for so many people I know, but all went well.    I woke up last night at 4 in the morning shaking and sweating--102 degree fever.  Awesome.  Then, my flight today (which was supposed to leave at 6:45pm) got delayed and I was told I'd have to wait and leave at 6:30 tomorrow morning.  So I'm still in Memphis, but I'm glad because I can get a good night's sleep and not have to travel late at night.  Anyway, I'm rambling...

						    urlLink Marlon Brando died yesterday at the age of 80. .  While not altogether surprising, its certainly still sad to see a legend of such stature pass from this world.  He's always been one of my favorites--from his work in Kazan's "Streetcar Named Desire" and "On the Waterfront" to his work in "The Godfather" films to his latter years as an eccentric recluse, Brando has always been a larger-than-life sort of person.  If any of you have not seen it and you ever get the chance to, I can't tell you how great his early-90's interview with Larry King is.  Absolutely priceless.  Basically, to grant the interview, Brando stipulated--in writing apparently--that King would basically have to do the whole interview on Brando's own terms.  The result is sheer hilarity--King tries to frame Brando as the kooky hermit, but Brando just relentless tears King's psyche apart in a way that is laugh out loud funny.  Find it, you won't be disappointed.  Here's to a legend...

I think we can all sleep a little easier tonight knowing that a 74 year-old man who's spent half a century in prison is no longer a "threat to society".  Bravo.

						    urlLink Bruce Springsteen had a nice Op-Ed piece in this morning's New York Times .  He makes some excellent points and nicely articulates why this country needs a drastic change in leadership, while managing to refrain from finger-pointing or name-calling.  Well put, Boss.

						   This is kind of random, but things have been slow around here as of late, so I thought I'd share anyway.   If any of you are stand-up comedy fans or just fans of things that are truly hilarious, I encourage you to  urlLink check out the work of my hero, Bill Hicks .  Hicks died of cancer at the tragically early age of 32, but in his short life he left and indelible mark on both stand-up comedy and the world itself.  As a comic, there is no one--even Master Pryor--whose work I find to be more hilarious, brilliant and inspiring.  Hicks is the comic whose material I most wish I could rip off.  He's so good.  The thing that truly differentiated Hicks from other comics was the philosophical depth he infused his material with.  Equally hilarious and trancendant, his jokes made you laugh, made you angry, made you see the truth about the world and all its absurdity.   Check out his stuff, pretty much any of it--I promise, you'll thank me for it...

						   Sorry for the light posting, just been busy at work.  But, in case you missed it, or our spineless media chooses not to adequately cover it,  urlLink here's proof  suggesting what I've been saying all along: Mr. "Tough On Terror/War President" is using fear and terror to manipulate the people into ignoring the miserable failures of his administration.   Sad that this is what we've been reduced to...   urlLink More here  from the WaPo.

						   ( urlLink Kerry has a nice turnout .)     But 15,000 people braved what local officials described as the hottest day of the year while they waited for a fleet of Kerry/Edwards tour buses to arrive. Nearly 100 people had to be treated for heat exhaustion or dehydration, according to Scranton Fire Chief Tom Davis.      The size of the crowd surprised both city and campaign officials, who claimed the turnout was a reflection of the vitality of both.      It's significant that Kerry picked Scranton — a socially conservative swing city with a reputation for supporting labor in a battleground state — to hold his first rally after accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for president during this week's convention in Boston.   (snip)   And when Kerry tried to introduce to the crowd his younger daughter, third-year medical student Vanessa, she had gone to administer first aid to a man who had passed out.      Meanwhile, at some bar in Texas, the Bush Twins just passed out ...

						   I can't believe this moron gets as many hits as he does.   urlLink Read this funny story  about his stealing an image, then doing a clumsy Photoshop job to try and cover it up.  What a chump.
