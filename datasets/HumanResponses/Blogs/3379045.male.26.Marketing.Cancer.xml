      So S and I went and saw the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" the day after yesterday (get it?  I'm funny).  It's so refreshing to see a movie with absolutely no political agenda!  Next on the list, Farenheit 9/11!  (kidding of course).  Even though the movie was laced with it's obvious liberal slant, there were some definitely cool aspects.  The special effects showing the different parts of the global climate change were super duper cool!  The huge wave that sweeps over NY is really cool!  They showed clips of it in the trailer, but the actual event in the movie is awesome with the wave consuming large parts of the city!  Oh, and Sela Ward is fucking hot for an older chick.  I'd like to do her the day after tomorrow.  In fact, I think I'm going to use her as the object of my masterbatory thinking the evening before tomorrow morning.  Looks like I'll have to be doing some sheet washing on the day after the last day of May.  DOH!

      My day started out great this morning!  I got out of bed at the crack of dawn (okay, it was 8:00) and I headed out to the beach.  It looked like it was going to be a beautiful day so I was really excited!  Before I left town, I decided I should probably fill up on some gas since the beach I was heading to was about 60 miles away.  So, I pulled up to the pump and saw that the premium gas (which my car requires) is currently $2.779 a gallon.  Shit.  I began pumping and $30 later, I had a full tank of gas (which is only in ballpark of about 12 gallons)!  Yeah me!  Needless to say, my butthole felt somewhat raw after the ass raping that I received at the hands of Union 76.  The next time I go to fill up, I will make sure that I am properly lubricated and completely stretched out in anticipation of the relentless probing of my nether-regions.  On a positive note, it did turn out to be a beautiful day!  It was in the mid 70's and there wasn't a single cloud in the sky!  The beach was pretty packed, but I was able to find my own little place on the sand to kick back on for a few hours.  I managed to get some decent color in my skin so I am one step closer to looking like Latin American idol, Ricky Martin.  Wait til you see me shake my bon bon.

      So I just got promoted again yesterday!  I was eligible after 6 months in my current position and this promotion will be effective on my first day of eligibility!  I'm very happy about my promotion, but I still worry whether or not the company will even be around in 6 months!!!

      I ran across this article and it actually echoes the same points I was making when debating with my friends yesterday.     urlLink http://www.claremont.org/writings/040519bennett.html   Bennett has a clear perspective on what we're up against in this world and why we're in Iraq.  I know a lot of people disagree with Bush's decision to take us to war.  Most of my friends, especially here in the Bay Area, disagree with that decision and are completely against it.  But, I think it was a necessity on so many levels.  War is never fun.  War is ugly.  Was going to Iraq the right thing to do?  Unfortunately, I think it was.  I hate that we're losing brave Americans daily.  I hate that innocent Iraqi and American civilians are being killed.  I don't think anyone (Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals) wanted to see this, but I don't think that should deter us from bringing stability to Iraq at this point.  There are people in Iraq who want us to get the fuck out and will do some terrible things to make that point(ie behead Nick Berg, drag dead American bodies through the street, etc), but I think the people of Iraq deserve to live in peace.  It's going to take time for Iraq to move from a country of fear to a country of freedom and I hope this happens sooner than later.  Who knows how things will turn out in Iraq.  I think about the situation quite a bit and I say a prayer every night for our soldiers and for the people of Iraq.  I really hope that in the end, the people of Iraq will know the freedoms that I am so very fortunate to have here in America.

      Okay, so I was in the restroom this morning doing a #2 that had been brewing since early last night (I couldn't do it at S's place because my guess is that stinking up her bathroom would be a no-no).  I'm sitting there in the last stall and all of a sudden some guy in a suit tries to open the door!  Well, apparently the lock on the door sucks so 2 seconds later, this guy has the door open and is staring at me while I'm giving birth to some butt babies!  He realizes that someone is in the stall (Hello!  That smell didn't make itself!  get a clue asshole!) and closes the door.  How "crappy" is that? (Yes, I'm funny).  I'm convinced that sitting on the crapper is probably one of the most vulnerable positions you can be in for both your dignity and your body (hell, I could kick Steven Segal's ass if he was taking a shit!).  The worst part is that the guy was in a suit so he was obviously one of the investors that's been in the building looking to purchase Mervyn's.  Could the sight of me doing a #2 steer him away from a purchase of the Merv and lead to me losing my job (knock on wood)?  Only time will tell.

      So I've been having a rather heated debate with some friends of mine and it's exhausting.  It's amazing how some people can be so close-minded (including myself).  I've never been one to cave in on an argument and I wonder if, in the end, I'd be happier if I gave a little bit on my opinions.  I'm sure a lot of other people would be happier if I did.  I'm so worked up right now.  Grrrrrrrrrr.........  On the bright side, I'm heading out with S tonight and I can't wait!  We're doing sushi at her favorite place in the city and we'll probably grab some drinks afterwards.  She has been such a breath of fresh air and I consider myself very fortunate right now.

      Interesting fact:  the plasic cap of a 20 oz Diet Pepsi perfectly fits on the glass bottle of a 750 ML of a Gordon's London Dry Gin bottle.  Amazing.

      I have my first date with L tomorrow and I'm really excited!  The woman is absolutely stunning and drop-dead gorgeous.  When I met her, my jaw dropped...wow...I'm glad this date is finally happening after the several misses in the past.  I'm not sure where we're heading, but I know we're gonna have a great time!

      So I called the doctor for the THIRD time in two weeks because of my head and I ended up getting a prescription for Vicodin.  I took one earlier and it knocked me out, but now I'm up and my fucking head is throbbing.  There is absolutely something wrong with my melon right now and these fucking doctors don't seem to get it.  The doctor I saw today did put in a request for a CAT scan for me today so hopefully that'll happen sometime in the next week or so and I'll get some relief.  Fucking Kaiser.

      Last night S and I had a conversation and I let her know that I just didn't think we were in the same place - I've started to realize that I'm still not ready for a relationship.  I feel really bad because she's such a sweet girl and I know she was hoping things would end up a little different.  There are a ton of reasons that it had to be done, but it's still not easy.  I just hope she doesn't hate me.

      Gmail!  I want you so bad!  Why can't I have you?  Some of my friends have you, but they don't have anymore invitations!  :(  All I want is your 1 gigabyte storage space and your advanced spam filtering capabilities.  Why must you be so hard to obtain?  All I do is think of you, day and night.  I can't get you off my mind, I think about you all the time.  I know, I know...I just used a quote from the group "Surface", but that's honestly how I feel about you.  No other email service makes me feel this way.  If I could only have you, my life would be complete.  I would never miss emails due to a full inbox and I would be able to filter incoming emails by work, personal, or misc to help me stay organized.  My sweet Gmail, if you're reading this, don't tease me like you've been doing.  Come to me!  I promise to use you as my main email address going forward once you are mine.  Please, don't deny me anymore!

      Okay, so I'm really annoyed right now.  I've been thinking about the movie "White Chicks" by the Wayans brothers and it really drives me nuts.  If I even said the words "black chicks" in conversation, I would probably be labeled as a racist!  Yet these guys are able to make a movie that not only uses a term that could be considered derogatory, but apparently perpetuate stereotypes of of "white girls" (I haven't seen the movie, but the preview is full of stereotypes).  Maybe the movie itself isn't full of stereotypes, but from the title and the preview, I'm willing to bet that the movie's "humor" comes from playing on white girls.  I'm sure if I saw the movie I'd laugh my ass off.  I guess my main gripe is that if I even attempted to make a movie about a "black chick" who tries to become a professional golfer, I'd be labeled a racist.  Again, I'm not offended by the humor in the movie - I don't give a shit about racist jokes, etc (they're funny in my book), it just drives me nuts at the double standard - I can't do my little finger snap and say "Oh no you didn't!" without being labeled a racist.....Bullshit if you ask me....

      So, I'm not a huge fan of hippies.  They have every right to protest, etc, but when they interrupt my day by clogging up the streets, it gets me upset.  So, I think I'm going to begin crashing the anti-war protests in SF with the group www.protestwarrior.com whenever there's a rally in the city.  Maybe I'll be able to talk to one of these hippies and talk some sense into them....who knows....

      I'm watching TV coverage of Reagan/D-Day and the anchor brought up a quote that Reagan made 20 years ago on the 40th anniversary of D-Day:  "The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt."  20 years after this speech was made, the US still strives for the same goals - as we've seen in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US does not use its military for conquest, but for liberation.  Our goal was to make our country more secure (which I pray we did).  In the process we have freed 20 million people from tyranny and oppression.  I strongly believe that our action, though costly in both lives and world opinion, was righteous and necessary.  Most of my friends disagree with me - they are entitled to that point of view.  But, I am so proud of our troops and I continute to pray for them.

      So I went to the beach with my friend Neelam from work and it turned out to be a great day!  The weather was in the high 60's and there was a light breeze so it was perfect!  We layed out in the sun for about 4 hours and just had a very relaxing day.  This is my second week in a row at the beach so my tan is getting darker and darker!  Goodbye Honkey, hello Hunk-ey.  What's funny is that one random person at work thought that Neelam and I were dating since we hang out all the time and asked someone "So is Neelam dating that Latino guy?".....Hahahahaha!  Apparently I'm Latino!  My tan is only going to help perpetuate that rumor!  Dios mio!  After the beach, I fired up the grill and had a FANTASTIC ribeye!  Yum!  I didn't think I'd be able to feel this way about a cut of meat, but I have a true affection for ribeye.  It happens to be the most perfect meat in the world, especially after a carefully watched stay on a hot grill so that it's medium-rare and brushed with a tasty grilling sauce.  Man, ribeye fucking rocks!

      My head hurts.  I hit it pretty hard on a cabinet door a week ago when I was doing laundry and I still get pretty frequent headaches.  I went to the doctor and saw some physian's assistant named Cummings and apparently I don't have a concussion.  I still feel like shit a week later.  If I don't feel better by Monday, I'm gonna head to Kaiser again (and pay those fucks another $25!) and hopefully figure out what the hell's wrong.

      So, I'm going to see Prince for the third time in as many months tonight!  He's playing in San Jose so I'm heading down after work and I can't wait!  He's playing in Oakland in September (possibly 4 days in a row!!!!) so I'm definitely going to get my Prince fill for the year!  One of my coworkers who sits right by me is going tonight and she's just an average fan (ie, she likes the stuff everyone else likes...."When Doves Cry", "Let's Go Crazy", etc...) and I'm SO EXCITED for HER because I know that once she leaves this show, she'll understand why I love Prince the way I do!  I can't wait!!!  :)

      Fab.  I might have a job for awhile.  I still have semi-mixed feelings about the sale of Mervyn's, but I'm leaning more towards the positive side.  We'll see, but I think things should work out and opportunities should open up at Mervyn's soon!

      Okay, so I guess I don't really understand protesters.  I was reading an article about how anti-abortionists and anti-war people got into a couple scuffles while protesting in Boston.  I think a lot of times, it's just silly.  I'm personally against abortion, but I don't think that me going out with a sign on the street is really going to change anyone's mind - just my personal opinion.  I think protesters tend to be more of an annoyance than anything and I think that their time could be better spent doing other things.  Just my opinion.  I think they should have every right to go out and say whatever they want, but I don't think it does a whole lot to either help or hinder their cause.  I could be wrong...in fact, I probably am, but I just think protests rank high on the list of suckitude.

      Okay, the title to this entry is a little misleading - the song I am about to mention is not just a currently favorite song, but it's also a frequently favorite song.  I just happen to mention it now.  Are you ready for the title?  "Soul Sanctuary" by Prince (actually, he was going by the symbol at the time this came out).  If you haven't heard this song, you need to download it.  One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard (yes, I'm biased).  Listen to it.....great song.

      I finally got around to watching Michael Moore's liberal propoganda film Fahrenheit 9/11 and it was what I expected. Of couse I didn't pay that piece of shit a dime to see his movie - I downloaded it. I went on and on with my liberal friends today about the many issues I had with the movie so I don't really feel like ranting about it now - gotta watch my blood pressure! Anyways, here's a great link showing many of the flat out lies that Moore throws into his little film:    urlLink  http://www.davekopel.com/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm   Anyways, I just hope that if people see this movie, they check their facts. I can respect a liberal who does all the research they can and form their opinion. I don't agree with them on most issues, but I can respect them for keeping themselves informed. I can't stand people who take an anti-Bush stand or an anti-conservative stand without really looking into the issues. I try to keep myself as informed as possible. Hell, I watched Moore's piece of shit movie. Did I go into it with a bias? Of course. But, I at least watched it and research what was real, what was false, etc.... I didn't like a lot of things about the movie (ie Bush was the villian but Bin Laden was showed in a more favorable light...that's just wrong). Okay, I'm done. I ranted all day. No more. Bye.

           Today I received a letter from the state of California which said the following:  "The Governor signed Executive Order S-1-03, reducing the Vehicle License Fee and directing refunds made to vehicle owners.  This check represents the overpayment of your Vehicle License Fee.  Interest has been included where appropriate."  Attached to this letter was a check from the State of California in the amount of  $266.58!   Wow.  That just made my day.  Thanks Arnold!
