       Grrrrrrr Munson's defense is really annoying.  He has shown some improvement at the plate, but has shown little to no improvement defensively and personally I can't wait for Inge to come back from the DL to take his spot at 3B.  Prior to my trip to Denver to see the Tigers play against the Rockies I really had been sticking up for Munson on a regular basis.  However, since then he has really gotten under my skin with his piss poor defense and his smug/arrogant personality.  When I was in Colorado I had the opportunity to watch him take BP and converse with fans and other players(mostly other players, and mostly staring at the good looking women in the stands), while observing Munson I saw him trying to talk to a good looking woman in the stands.  She wanted nothing to do with him and even when he threw her a ball after his BP she gave it to a little kid near her and refused to talk to him.  I just thought that was amazingly funny because as SMUG and ARROGANT as he is, he still can't get the women.  I really hope Munson can get his act together and I won't turn my back on any of the Tigers, but he is really frustrating me defensively.  HIS ATTITUDE MUST CHANGE.  He is here to help the Tigers WIN, NOTHING ELSE!    On to JASON SMITH.  I can't really get upset at him for his hitting but, MAN O MAN, when I was in Denver....the first game against the Rockies, he really really pissed me off.  Two errors in the Bottom of the 10th inning by Smith cost us the game.  Given, they weren't EASY PLAYS by any means, but come on you get paid very well to make those plays and keep us in the game, and he simply couldn't do it.  That said, I would rather see him at 3rd base defensively over Munson.    Just another Note, how did Cleveland get 5 All-stars and the Twins only get 1 All-star?  Joe Torre must be crazy to think that Westbrook can help the team more than Johan Santana or Nate Robertson.  WAKE UP JOE!!!!  The Tigers are currently winning 4-2 in the bottom of the 7th.....GOOOOO TIGERS!!!!  GET WELL SOON: Rondell White(Day To Day) Fernando Vina(60 Day DL) Brandon Inge(15 Day DL) Nate Cornejo(60 Day DL) Craig Monroe(no timetable has been set for Craig's return) Dmitri Young(playing through injury) Alex Sanchez(won't return to the field until after the all-star break) Ivan Rodriguez(playing through injury)  CONGRATS ON THE BABY(SOON TO COME): Mr. and Mrs. Alex Sanchez

      I had the opportunity to listen to a Twins broadcast tonight(Twins vs Tigers) on MLB.TV and at the end of the game all they were talking about were the fans(mechanical devices) at the Metrodome, more well known as the HOMER DOME.  The Twins broadcasters were talking about the fans all game because they said that Tram had accused the Twins of using the fans in a prior series.  During the 8th inning they "turned on the fans" and it almost was believable(NOT) because the Twins came up and had 2 straight hits, but only scored 1 run.  What the deal is with the Fans I really don't know.  All I do know is that the Tiger have evened up the series 1-1.  GOOOOOOOOO TIGERS!!!   Winners from the AL Central on Friday            CURRENT AL CENTRAL STANDINGS-THROUGH FRIDAY   TWINS(--)       SOX(1.5)         INDIANS(6.0)     TIGERS(7.0)       ROYALS(16)

          Welcome to my "BLOG".    I am going to have fun with this and I hope you can have fun with me.  If anyone has any suggestions or would like to see anything on my "BLOG" please let me know.   I am watching the Tigers as we speak on MLB.TV and the one thing that really strikes me as disturbing is the Tigers awful defense.  While in Colorado I had the chance to see first hand Jason Smith blow a perfectly winnable game with 2 errors on back to back plays in the bottom of the 10th inning of last Friday nights game.  That play made me sick to my stomach.    On to a better subject.  The improvement the Tigers have shown from last year to this year is astounding and really shows that the front office is trying to make this work.  Well, the Tigers are currently up four to nothing in the bottom of the 3rd inning on the power of a 3 run homer by Carlos "All-Star" Guillen and of all people Jason "I Can't Field and should be in AAA" Smith.  On a completely different subject, I am looking for the complete set of the Pistons Burger King Bobbleheads.  If anyone knows where I can get a set at a reasonable price please let me know.  I am checking out ebay and it seems people want outrageous prices.  How much did these cost when you bought them from Burger King(only available in the Detroit Area)?
