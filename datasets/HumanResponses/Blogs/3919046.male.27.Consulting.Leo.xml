      So it's been a while..........new news, my girlfriend is moving here. (I've been commuting every weekend for the last 9 months almost to see her. 4.5 hours one way.) So that's really cool. I'm really irritated about something. Why does corporate america think 40 hours a week is no longer acceptable? Did you know that people complain about me here because I keep 8-5? They must like to work longer hours. I, personally, don't have a huge desire to be here any more than I have to. Also, it helps that I don't have much to do. But I think it's really stupid that the retards working corporate (the idiot "company" people....."I'm a company man!! woohoo!") Give me a break people. Don't you realize that you're raising the bar to longer and longer and longer hours? CAN IT REALLY NOT WAIT TILL TOMORROW???? Come on. So these company people are so retarded they WANT to work longer hours. They choose to. Most of them don't HAVE to. They want to. What about their families? What about having a life? What about their pay? Don't they understand that they are paid to work FULL TIME? That means 40 hours&nbsp; a week folks. It doesn't mean 50, 60, 70. Every extra hour over 40 hours a week for those salary folks means money out of their pocket. And they are okay with that. To me, my time is worth something. I put in what is expected of me from the company. What do they expect? 40 hours a week. But instead, these idiots work more than that for free, making those that do it right look bad. Then they have the nerve to complain about those working the right amount of hours.&nbsp; Okay, I'm done complaining. By the way, I bought 18" G Racing wheels for my 2001 Honda Civic. They look pretty tight. :) I'm out.

      Why did I make that title? Look Away From Yourself. I think because so often people are centered on themselves and especially these days......people are so focused on themselves that they let doors slam into the person behind them, they bump into you and don't say sorry, they say something to you without even thinking, they don't spend time with their kids or wives or husbands, they lose a reason of why they are actually alive. When you look away from just yourself you can see others, you can see if they're hurting, you can see if you can help someone, you can see if you're a help or a hindrance to someone, the world, your family, your dog....whatever. So, look away from yourself. Try it!! Maybe you'll make this world a better place.

      Okay, so far this is a bit out of my league. I don't know computer speak, my URL for my picture is too long to post on my blog...So I guess I just kind of do away with the frills and have a strictly "BLOG" blogger. Does that make sense?  I've always been into writing. I solve things by writing. Am I having a problem with my love life? I write them a letter. How is it so much easier to write your problems than it is to speak them? By writing I've solved a lot of my own problems because in free flow writing it is exactly that...free flow. Which means when you try to think of something to say you don't write it because of all the baggage that comes with it. If you just write and forget about why you're writing and JUST WRITE then you'll be much better off. I'm sure all of you seasoned veteran bloggers already know that.  I'm at work right now. This is ridiculous. Do you know how much work I have done in the last 50 hours? I have done about 1 hour of actual work. Well, some of you would think that is a good thing. Let me tell you, it is not. It is as boring as watching paint dry. As sickening as watching two people in love when you're heart is broken. That's pretty bad. I have a job that doesn't give me anything to do. I'd say that is a GIGANTIC WASTE OF MONEY!! But it's hard to complain when it's me here, doing nothing and getting paid for it. I'll let this be all folks. Chill.
