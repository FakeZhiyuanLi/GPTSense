       Earlier I wrote about how I'd bought the final component for my new PC, but it turns out I was wrong. I managed to miss the fact that my motherboard doesn't have on-board video, so I needed a video card. I picked one up yesterday, plugged it in, and fired up my PC for the first time. There's a slight problem with the floppy drive, but apart from that, the as-yet-unnamed PC is fully functional.  I have yet to install the operating system, because: a) the keyboard is a fancy affair that needs a special driver installed before it can send function keystroke signals and b) the Windows XP installation requires you to press F8 to say you agree to the licence. I'll try plugging it into a USB port instead of its current PS/2 port tonight.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I'd post pictures, if I had any. PPS - Maybe some other time.

       How do you prioritise when everything is urgent and none of it is easy? That is, everything will take some time to do, it needs to be done really quickly, and there is more than one project behaving like this. I'm at a loss.  When things get hectic, I tend to fold over and let myself fail. I've never found out why that might be. Perhaps I don't believe in myself or my abilities enough. But when I think of it that way, it doesn't paint the whole picture. I don't think I fear success, though I do shy away from both compliments and criticism. "Let me do my own thing at my own pace, and keep your opinions to yourself", I seem to say.  Unfortunately, this is not the way the world works. I'm not supposed to make myself an island. I don't think I am. I'll ask for help when I need it and I think you can provide it. But when the phrase "my responsibility alone" crosses my mind, it's all over.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Hopefully, one day, I'll run out of introspective things to say here. PPS - Maybe when I'm eighty or so.

       Last night I forgot to set my alarm clock, so this morning I was glad that I still live with my Dad who still makes sure that meal times are family times. I was up a little later than I planned, but when I rearranged my morning routine, everything fitted in nicely and I still had time for fifteen minutes of reading before I left for work.  I'm breezing through Isaac Asimov's " I, Robot " partly because it's a classic I recently bought and partly because I've seen a trailer for the upcoming movie. It looks to me like the movie will be incredibly unfaithful to the Three Laws and Asimov's vision for the world of robots. To be sure, his stories usually involve something going wrong with a robot, but the movie shows blatant breakage of the First Law on a wide scale by thousands of robots. The story as I remember it never had anything like that. I guess the original story couldn't make much of a movie. So why try to make one?  I'll probably go see it anyway.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Well, that drifted rather rapidly off-topic, didn't it? PPS -  urlLink The Three Laws of Robotics .

       Today I purchased the last necessary part of my new PC - the mouse. Actually, it's an optical trackball, because that's all I have room for on my desk. Tonight's project will be to connect everything together, fire it up and see if it works. It's possible I've put the case fan in backwards, and I'm sure there will be some issues with the hard drive and DVD/CDRW drive living on the same IDE cable. The rest should be fine.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - If it isn't, I'll probably give up for a week or so. PPS - But not forever, of course.

       A few weeks ago I bought a packet of chips - I think they were Burger Rings. Inside the packet was a small metal disc that ruined my life - a Yu-Gi-Oh Tazo Metallix. I call myself addicted because I don't much care about the chips or Yu-Gi-Oh, but I've been buying an average of three packets of chips every two days, just to get more. To borrow a phrase from another cartoon, I've gotta catch 'em all.  I now own 17 discs, each of which has cost me $1.50. Yes, I got some chips with them, but I'd have been just as happy to throw the chips away and keep the Tazo. 17 discs at $1.50 each comes to $25.50 over a week or two. I'm likely to keep going.  My only hope is that the newly-opened Subway just down the road can take all my money before my Tazo collection does.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Having no control over one's wallet is an odd feeling.

       Some days you wake up feeling good. Today seems to be one of those, despite the fact that I am, once again, turning to chemical aids to stay awake. Today's wake-up call is Milo "Energy Food Drink" which sounds very stupid when you put it like that. Doesn't taste great. Slightly bitter.  Anyway, probably contributing to the general good mood was the bus ride to work. I should start by saying that I name some of the familiar strangers I see on the bus. Today I sat next to "Lisa". I usually travel in silence, either reading or staring out the window, apart from an occasional "bless you" response to a sneeze. Today was no exception to the vow of silence. Sometimes it just feels good to be in the presence of people with whom no speech is necessary. Awkward pauses are the worst.  Everyone please raise your caffeinated beverages in a toast to silence.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - But no clinking them together. PPS - Man, this Milo better be worth it.

       Every man (and probably some women, too) wants to be more than an ordinary man. We want to be stronger, faster or smarter than the average man. To leap tall buildings in a single hyperbole. We want this because we love power and superiority, and superhuman powers are, to most people, power without responsibility.  The way we demonstrate our "incredible" powers varies, of course, but it usually amounts to biting off more than we can chew, then attempting to make it look easy. The results are more often comical than impressive. I have been the perpetrator of such showoff behaviour myself, more than once. I blame testosterone. I think I've learned to deal with the small doses well enough, but the big hits can still take me down to the level of parading monkey.  Here's to being unwitting victims of our body chemistry.

       Man, I could really use a day off. I don't think I'd do anything much with it, besides sleep, but I do think it would do me a world of good. Recently I've been very bogged down  outside  work. Work itself is fine, really. The way I know I'm too busy is that I've had to make a schedule to cram everything in and remember it all. The kind of schedule I can handle fits inside my slightly-oversized memory. This one doesn't.  Two weeks and counting down.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - The PS/PPS style is starting to feel a bit tacked-on here. PPS - But this is what I do, so I'll just keep on doing it.

        How to disintegrate spiders   This morning, as I was washing the dishes, a small spider appeared near the sink. I left it alone, but still vowed to destroy the creature should it get in my way. As it turns out, that was unnecessary.  Our young Mr Spider was drawn to the hot water, and dipped a toe in. It seems that was too much for it, as it turned around to make a hasty retreat. Unfortunately, it slipped and fell backwards into the suds. As I cleared the bubbles aside to check on the fate of the little monster, I was surprised to find that every one of its legs had fallen off. Apparently, this is what happens to spiders in hot water.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - And thus nature has presented me with yet another spider-annihilating method. PPS - "Science again!

        Blog on Blogging or "The Why"   I've been asked why on earth I would do something like this, and my immediate response was "Because the world needs to hear and ignore what I have to say". That's probably pretty much it. I'm happy for my thoughts to be on the web, even if nobody's reading them. Like shouting into the desert.  So what's the point? It's psychological, of course. I can't tell if anyone's reading or not (most likely not, so far) but they  could  be, and that's what matters. It's not like I'm writing in a journal nobody can ever read at all, or won't until I'm dead. This one is out there for everyone to see.  Most of my need to express myself is already fulfilled in my paper journal, and  that  one nobody will see until I'm gone. That's probably why updates here will be so infrequent. There's not much difference between the two.  So I've got to figure out what I want to say here. Back when I knew everything, I wanted to tell people how to be better (especially my fellow males), how to design better software and how to become a person to be feared. Now I probably just want to talk about software.  I guess I'm not going anywhere with this. Best to quit while I'm still relatively coherent.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - There are some behaviours I know I should not encourage. PPS - Usually they are the ones I allow to continue the longest.

        The Joys of Code Re-use   Any programmer who's worked on a project of any notable size would like to re-use code. I certainly do, and I usually plan objects that way. I've been working on one project (in C#.NET) for over a year now, and have developed a business layer that is reasonably generic, but still needs lots of work. A few days ago I was given another small project - an online graduate job application form - and I decided to re-use my business code. That part was relatively easy, although it could be easier. The hard part was the web front end.  Okay, to be honest, the web controls code I was using was more specific to the old project, so it wasn't much intended to be re-used, but I did it anyway. That just served to highlight the point that a generic web front end framework would be really useful. Besides the hoops I had to jump through to get the thing working, it's not extensible. If I need a new control - say, a date input - then I can write it, but I need to go back to the original code and modify that, too. This makes me think there is a better way, like an interface. I think I can make it better, but it would take lots of time that the company probably wouldn't pay me for.  In all, and as usual, the more interesting job is writing frameworks, tools and components rather than writing actual applications.   Mokalus of Borg  PS - A true hacker, I suppose, is the programming equivalent of a research professor. PPS - That is, the ideas matter more than whether this will actually be used by anyone.

       The Borg Blog has had its wish of becoming a real boy granted! Mokalus of Blog is now online at its new Blogger.com home, and I plan to stay here for just a little while.  Before anyone notices and gets upset, there is another Mokalus in this world. I was surprised to discover this one day when I went ego-surfing at Google. I thought, way back in 1997 or so, that I had created a unique name that would be unlikely to crop up again. Apparently I was wrong. My doppelganger (sp?) is also a blogger, and he lives at  urlLink http://mokalus.blogspot.com/ . I've only given it a cursory glance, really, but he seems to love Jesus, so I've got no gripes.  I will probably post here only a few times a week, because I know how busy you all are. ;)  Peace, out.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I have yet to decide if I should stick with my "PS/PPS" post style in the blog. PPS - I'll give it a try for a while, at least.

       To me, a Zen garden is a profoundly beautiful thing, with raked sand around stones. Of course, that's not the only form of Zen garden, but it's the form that we've latched onto as Westerners. It seems either stupid or strange to condense such an object into a size conventient for desktop use. It seems like a typical Western bent on an Eastern design: distil, condense, simplify, mass-produce and sell. I'll admit that it is entirely possible, say, to create a desktop Zen garden that does not betray its philosophy, but when it's made of plastic and sells for $9.95 with colourful pebbles, someone's gone too far.  Think of a Western icon, like a sports car or a cathedral, then reduce it in size, make it of poor quality, and put it on your desk. Now what's it for? It doesn't represent anything it did before, and most of its actual function has disappeared. If I was a Zen Buddhist, that's probably how I'd feel about desktop Zen stone gardens.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - But then again, if I was a Buddhist, I'd have a different personal philosophy. PPS - So I can't actually say for certain how I'd feel about it all.

       My web browser Firefox (and, I would presume, Mozilla proper) has a nifty feature I discovered this morning - keywords for bookmarks that can be parameterised. So, for example, you can define a bookmark to Google in a certain way, give it a keyword, and then search just by typing "google frogs" in the address bar. (Not that you would do  that , however, since Firefox has a built-in search box, too.)  The second part of the puzzle is our web proxy running here at work. It extensive and over-paranoid site blocking, but does save us heaps of bandwidth on banner ads. Still, some sites are blocked unfairly, and a way around the proxy for those sites would be good.  I found a way around it by using Google translation - tell it to translate from English to English, and the proxy is blind. I've memorised the URL prefix to append to any blocked site to view it via this method.  Parameterised keyword bookmarks seemed like a perfect way to avoid typing the longish URL prefix, so I gave it a go. I defined a parameterised keyword bookmark, found a blocked site, and typed my keyword before the URL in the address bar. Firefox couldn't handle all the dots and slashes as part of a parameter and fell flat on its face. Sigh.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I don't think I'll file a bug report. PPS - For all I know, this is by design.

       On the Blogger main page at the moment is a link to "Blindfold Blog" - a blog written by Ann Marie, who is apparently training to be a Guide Dog trainer. Confused yet? Anyway, as part of her training, she had to spend ten days blindfolded and working with a trained dog, to get an inside perspective. I found it really interesting, especially the blindfold removal on day 10.  I've seen documentaries of people with restored sight, too, and I think it's fascinating to observe people learning to use their eyes again (or for the first time). I think learning is one of the most interesting phenomena to observe in this world.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Almost forgot the  urlLink link .

       The last, final, absolutely never again meeting for the church fair was last night, where I presented my final report and bowed out. That's it. No more. People there seemed to be assuming I'd be taking the job again next year. Not on your life. As with everything, it seems less stressful in hindsight, but I must remember that my time spent planning this fair was full of stress and pain. I did not enjoy it, and I'm extremely happy it's over.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I will, however, be around to give advice to the next coordinator.

       I'd like to think that all I needed to get over my little funk was the good sleep I got last night, but I suspect that's not the case. Oh, well. I did need it, though.  I fold paper cranes as part of coping with stress. I have about twenty here at work at the moment, and more at home. It works reasonably well, as long as there are a few other methods in the repertoire.  Soon enough I'll have to start walking to the train station to procure my daily Tazo, since the vending machines here are running out, and I haven't seen one in the shops for over a week.

I've got to spend some time by the beach and wake up without an alarm clock for a few days in a row. I don't think I've even been doing that much.

       For some of us, it would be far better to do away with all weekly/monthly/yearly service charges and have those costs absorbed into transaction charges. For example, instead of paying $40 a month for dial-up Internet access with a limited free bandwidth and a charge per megabyte over that, you'd just pay a small fee per megabyte and no monthly fee. Your bank would not charge you account-keeping fees, but each deposit, withdrawal and transfer would cost you a tiny amount - that is, if your bank is petty enough to charge at all. Your cable television service would provide all channels without question, but you'd be charged a few cents per hour for what you watch, and just settle up at the end of the month.  The only barrier standing in the way of this microcharge service model is the greed of big companies. For most of us, the microcharge model would work out cheaper, which means less money going into big pockets. The unacceptable answer is to charge more per transaction, at which point customers balk at the thought.  Also, the model only works well for small consumers. To high-volume customers, such as mid-sized companies, monthly fees work out better than microcharges. That can be incorporated into the model with high-volume plans that charge  only  a regular flat fee that would probably be slightly higher than current service charges.

       I remember one Christmas when I was younger - I forget how old, and I can't reason it out - one of the stocking-stuffer gifts I got from Santa was a pair of very low-quality plastic scissors. In an extremely uncharacteristic action, I decided they were worthless and destroyed them.  Now, these scissors were just about the worst and cheapest scissors you could ever find, and they probably would have lasted about a week if I'd used them. Even all these years later I feel a little guilty for breaking them on purpose, although their total value probably amounted to about fifty cents. I don't know why I should still remember it, let alone feel anything about it.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - This has been yet another introspective psychological insight (tm).

       Do you ever have that experience when you think you've got it all sorted out and are about to make your move, then the whole game changes? Human relationships can do this. The way forward is never clear. I don't want to mention names or specific details, which makes this a little harder to express, but I'll give it a go.  There are three hearts involved, and one of them is mine. There is the same very good reason that I must reject both, and one has already rejected that reason, forcing me to come up with something else by Sunday. I will have to deal with both on Sunday, which is just the final little twist.  Did I blink? Has it always been this complicated? It would be good to have some advice on the issue.

       This coming Sunday I will have to choose whether I am a bastard or a hypocrite. That's what it boils down to, and that's probably why I'm having a tough time deciding. Neither is better than the other, and I cause problems either way. It's definitely not something I can or should run from. I do not envy anyone these kinds of choices. The damage is already done, it's just waiting to be unleashed, and I must decide which way I direct it. I absorb some of the damage either way. I can handle that. My concern is the collateral damage I'll cause.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Curse these non-threatening good looks!

       One of the things I like about programming computers is this: if you can't find the tools to do the job, you can make them yourself. In software there is no difference between the tools you use and the programs you write with them. So if you need, say, a personal organiser and what you can find doesn't suit your needs, you can write one that does. There are any number of programs I've thought about writing for exactly this reason. Usually it turns out someone else has done it for me, which is one of the things I like about the Internet.

Besides seeking out ska, rock and a little pop (not too much) I managed to take in a set from Christian metal band  urlLink Fearscape . It's extremely bizarre to see a band talk about Jesus in between songs that sound like that. Still, they do good work, and fill a niche in the Christian music scene for anyone who prefers their music heavy. Really heavy.  I caught  urlLink Gerald , as I always do, and  urlLink Crying Out Loud  and  urlLink Sounds Like Chicken  immediately afterwards. I saw  urlLink Rookie  twice, and I'm now officially a fan.  urlLink Rebecca St James  on Saturday was excellent, as were  urlLink The Lads  and  urlLink eLi . I saw a set by  urlLink Claire Hazzard , too, which was very good. I saw bits of other bands and probably some other full sets, too, but I've rambled on quite enough.  I met many interesting people who all liked my hat, and saw the kind of fashion sense that only comes out at festivals and raves. It's great to see people so free to express themselves, and I love to do that myself, too. I just wish it was a little more acceptable day-to-day. I left on Sunday night after eLi, which meant I missed  urlLink Propane , the last band to play the festival this year. I'll get a report from someone, I'm sure.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - There are two things that would make the festival complete: soap and hot showers with a little privacy. PPS - I didn't wash for the whole weekend, and I'm sure I started getting sick.

       It's getting a bit harder to keep up my habit of acquiring a new Yu-Gi-Oh Tazo disc every day. The chips in which they are distributed seem to be disappearing. This morning all I could find in the shop were Burger Rings. The other chips all had Crash Bandicoot Stunt Wheels in them - which I do not care about in the slightest.  I wonder what I'll do when I can no longer find any more to buy? I'm sure my collection will be incomplete, and as I have only one fellow collector to swap with, it will likely remain incomplete. I don't even know why I care.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - My Life (tm) is apparently as exciting as this. PPS - Perhaps I'll go watch the grass grow at lunchtime.

       He woke with the sun, eased out of bed, and picked up the horse's head that had appeared beside him in the night. With a sigh, he threw it out the window onto the growing pile. Frankly, he'd be worried if he  didn't  wake up next to yet another horse's head. He dressed, being careful first to remove the poisoned needles from the sleeves of his coat, then walked downstairs. He carefully stepped over the missing step and avoided using the railing that had been sawed almost, but not quite, completely off. He prepared a quick breakfast, avoiding the wide selection of poisoned foods, and boiled some water for coffee. As he took a sip and ducked a crossbow bolt that came flying in through his window, he sensed it was going to be one of those days.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - This is probably most directly inspired by the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork and the Assassin's Guild. PPS - These are both from the Discworld books.

       In the modern view of the mythical Cupid, we seem to have lost sight of the fact that he was a mischievous bastard. He's not working to make people fall in love, he's working to make trouble through misguided infatuation. How often have your own romantic involvements gotten so confused that they can't be called "triangle" in even the most liberal sense? At the moment I have chains and side-tracks along with any number of good excuses as to why each arrow points only one way. The tangled graph grows and shrinks, and all of us are just waiting to see a little spark in return.  I don't know if we'll ever figure it out.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - It all seems so much smaller when it's written down. PPS - It's still just as hard to handle, though.

       As part of the Windows XP development, Microsoft hired a lot of people to look at interfaces and usability. I know this because Tyler knows this. It's paid off, too. I'd rather not sound like an advertisement or MS propaganda, so I won't go on a long spiel about how much the Windows interface has improved. I'll just say that I'd like to congratulate Microsoft for finally getting properly behind usability, because that's what computers are supposed to be about. We should be looking toward a world where nobody needs to be trained to operate a computer, because it's so simple, or even invisible. That's still a long way off, of course.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - But we're getting there. Slowly. PPS - "Computer! Publish now!"

       Y'know what? Today I've got nothing I want to share. I could talk about television I watched last night, or how my new PC is coming along nicely, or even about the borderline-inappropriate discussions last night at supper after church, but I won't. And I don't have much to offer in the way of introspection, either. The continuing slow building of my Tazo collection is hardly news or exciting, and I have no software design thoughts to offer yet. Maybe I'll try to get some inspiration from Slashdot. Be right back.  Okay, it seems there's some lake under Antarctica that's completely cut off from the rest of the Earth, and scientists hope to dig into it to prove there is life there. Which there very likely is, considering what they've found in the ice above it. This will allow them once again to crow that extra-terrestrial life is possible, and probably fund a robotic excursion to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. But  of course  there's life in a lake on  Earth . It's  EARTH  - you know, where the life comes from?  You  live there? I'm sick of scientists wasting their time looking for aliens. The main reason they think it's possible is that they assume life is evolving from nothing all over the universe. I disagree, and I'm willing to wait for time to prove me right.  This opinion of mine is one of the reasons I like Red Dwarf. In the Red Dwarf books and television series, Earth is the one planet on which life existed to begin with. Genetically-engineered lifeforms, robots and so forth are widespread, but every single one can be traced back to Earth. It is phrased most poignantly in the books. I highly recommend them.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - In space, no-one can hear you scream. PPS - Mostly because there is no-one else there.

       Now that it's all over, I can relax again. The church fair came and went with little incident, though I had underplanned, as usual. On the day, I was missing the following items:  Eskis and ice for prizes  The equipment for two stalls   Some  of the equipment for two other stalls  Several workers  A radio to stay in contact with other organisers  Well, we managed to find one large eski and a small cooler, plus ice, as well as improvise for the partially-missing equipment. I cut my losses on the two missing stalls and used their staff to shore up the numbers on other stalls. I made do without a radio, too. I don't know the figures yet, so I can't say whether I got my section to break even or not.  What I know for sure is that all my stress vanished the second after the fair closed for the day. I'm so glad it's all over. Now I just have to write a report. That's much less stressful and has only minor consequences if it's late.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - These have surely been Interesting Times. PPS - Today's recommended reading is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.

       Last night I had a mole cut out, because it got in my way, so to speak. It was sitting right on my belt line, and for years it's been rubbing raw and healing, then rubbing raw again. I'd had enough, so I had it cut out. It actually scared me a bit, because it's the first time anyone's taken a scalpel to me for any reason, including threats. The procedure itself didn't hurt, because of the anaesthetic, but there's been a dull ache and an itch there ever since.  The stitches are staying in until after Easter, which is a bit longer than usual.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Or so the doctor tells me. PPS - And why would he lie?

       My new PC is now up and running with all its basic software installed, and very little else. I took it for a test drive last night, not looking for a benchmark or anything, just seeing if it would work. After installing video drivers and DVD player software, I spun up Eddie Izzard's " Dress to Kill ", a recording of a stand-up comedy show he did in San Francisco. I only got through a third of it, because it was getting late.  The only troubles I had with hardware were the floppy drive (recycled from an old 486, it seems to be dead) and the keyboard that I mentioned earlier. I think I've figured the keyboard out now, and I don't need a floppy drive right away, so I'll call it complete for now.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I could still use more desk space. PPS - Today's  urlLink wirewater  is an iced coffee Big M.

       A few times per day I get email from Big Accountant Guy (who some of you may remember). His emails are easy to distinguish from others, because they are all written entirely in the subject header and always go to everyone. They're not  for  everyone, just delivered to everyone. And that's the problem. It's much easier for him to write "To all job leaders remember today is invoicing day I need to do timesheets" and send it to everyone than to hunt down a list of current job leaders. Even if there was a single address to which he could send such messages, he'd have to remember which address it was, and he already knows one that will guarantee delivery to all those people.  So: there is a broadcast solution available when narrowcast (delivering the message only to those it affects) would be more appropriate. The cost of broadcast is smaller than the cost of narrowcast, unless you consider the negative PR cost associated with broadcast. You can take one second to send a specific message to everyone, even if it's only intended for a few of them, and everyone else will be annoyed for a few seconds, or you can take five minutes to send your message only to its intended recipients and not annoy anyone at all. The cost you immediately see is your time, so to hell with everyone else.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - This is not an attitude I condone. PPS - Not just because it affects me negatively.

       I just got driven home by the most ornery bus driver in Brisbane. It's not really that he's openly hostile, but if you want to ride on his bus, you'd better have a damn good excuse. Don't try to use even a pre-paid concession ticket without a concession ID, and God help you if you want to buy a ticket and need change. If he forgets to open the back door for you, you'd just better hoof it on up to the front before he drives off again. If he doesn't stop when you ding the bell, that's because he doesn't like your face.  I almost get the feeling this guy drives over puppies on purpose, and for fun. I remember him from my university days. No matter how long it took, or how much of a rush you were in to get to your lecture/tutorial/exam/date, he'd meticulously compare each picture ID with the presenting patron. I never saw him refuse entry, but did see him take issue with one or two cards.  Some bus drivers get thanked after the journey. I'll give you three guesses whether this driver is one of those. Some of my friends claim to have met the "Singing Bus Driver" who is all smiles and pleasantness to everyone on board, and belts out show tunes at the top of his talented lungs for the duration of the trip. With all the busses I've caught over the years, I'd think that, at least once, my driver would turn out to be Happy and not Grumpy.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - This is the first time I've seen this bus driver in a while. PPS - I hope it's the last in just as long.

       Every time I hear a mobile phone ring loudly, especially if it's wrangler is not present, I imagine smashing it into dust with a brick. It usually makes me feel better.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I hear these sounds in the office far too often. PPS - Especially for a place whose policy is that mobile phones are off during work hours.

       There are no Jedi and, furthermore, you are not Luke Skywalker. What is it about our lives that makes us seek fantasy? Is it the realisation that we are as boring as everyone else, or is it that increasingly unreal movies have created a thirst for the life less ordinary? It's probably both. Whether we just want to go on holiday or have adventures on a starship in a galaxy far, far away, we all seem to have some desire to shake off the dust of this one-horse town, so to speak.  The rut we dig ourselves into, before it gets too deep to see, becomes uncomfortable, and we look to hoist ourselves out and start something fresh. No harm in that, I suppose - neophilia has served to inspire many people. The problems come when we stay away and don't bring back our stories and lessons to the everyday world.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I am now about a third of the way through reading " urlLink The Last Command ". PPS - And I may be having a little trouble telling fantasy from reality.

       I've been reading Fight Club (for the uncivilised, it was a book before it was a movie) and the differences between the book and the movie are interesting. In the movie, the narrator's "Zen Master" phase was practically just mentioned in passing. In the book, he sticks with it a bit longer. He thinks in haiku to calm down. He says he gets ZEN in everyone's FACE, and writes it just like that.  I get the impression that our modern Western culture is becoming Buddhist by default. Not a true Buddhist culture, of course, because we're still consumerist Westerners and the true Buddhist elimination of desire would mean we all should give up our credit cards and stop lusting after the latest combination mobile phone/MP3 player/GPS device/waffle iron. So what exactly are we taking from Buddhism? Perhaps part of the reason our post-Christian society is leaning that way is because firstly, if you are a Buddhist, you are on a path, and are expected to be working it out rather than have it all worked out already. Secondly, it might be that nothing seems to be wrong in Buddhism: there are no commandments and no laws. No "Thou Shalt Not". Well, there  are , but they're more like suggestions. All in all, society is gradually embracing Buddhism because we're all too afraid to admit we actually believe in anything.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I am not a Buddhist. PPS - As such, I probably have a misguided idea of the Buddhist philosophy. Much like you do, unless you are a Buddhist.

       Because I seem to be socially maladjusted, my interactions with other people can seem strained at best and non-existent at worst. Last night during a long session at the local coffee establishment with many acquaintances, I felt particularly lonely, and wondered why. My current working theory is that I am tired and overworked, which means I'm unable to focus on anything for long - let alone the social interactions I usually find so taxing.  Could that be why so many of us feel more alone in the cities than residents of quieter towns claim to feel? Maybe not - I already have a theory about that. When we have thousands of people from which to pick and choose our friends, we don't have to be nice to everyone we meet, and end up being snarled at by most of the strangers we encounter. When there are only so many friends to go around, we need them all, and we are nice to everyone, which in turn creates a generally positive feeling in the community.  We have lost our community existence. A friend of mine - a youth worker - said that the basic unit of society used to be the village. Then it was the extended family. Then the nuclear family. Now it is the individual. Soon it will be the fragments of the individual.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Sometimes, I can hear it emerging already. PPS - Where will we be left when we can't even form a cohesive whole of ourselves?

       Last night I went out to dinner with some friends to a Chinese restaurant in Fortitude Valley called "Superbowl". I'd never been before, and Our Fearless Leader for the night had assured me the portions were quite large. We still needed 10 mains and 3 barrels of rice to fill 12 people, though. I'd definitely go again.  Also, yesterday, one of my workmates held one of my paper cranes for ransom. I didn't realise it would upset me until it happened. It only mattered because it was the green one - all the rest are white.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I wanted to cover his desk in cranes in response. PPS - But I only had time to fold four. I lead a busy life.

       I did the weekly grocery shopping last night because I won't have time to do it tonight (it's usually done on Thursday). My Tazo addiction showed itself again: I bought two packets of Stix just for the Tazos even though my collection is missing only five of the discs I could possibly find there. I have to call it an addiction now, because it's possible I'll just throw the chips out and keep the Tazo.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - If only all of life's problems were this petty and small. PPS - But in that case, I can imagine there would be more of them.

       An unfortunate combination of factors has recently cut my internet time at home down to virtually zero. To summarise, we have cable internet service now, and because it's an "always-on" connection, I installed a firewall program. This firewall program does not support Windows internet connection sharing, which was previously being used to connect two PCs to the net via one modem. Thus, until I find another solution, we are stuck with exactly one PC on the internet. Now enter the second factor: the online game Final Fantasy XI, which has captured my brother's attention and much of his time. Mix in a bit of irregular sleep patterns from him, and I have to beg and plead just to get an hour online at home.  In addition to all that, any time I  do  get online I am usually interrupted every five minutes by the questions "Are you done yet?" and "How long will you be?".  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I'm sure it's a really good game. PPS - It had better be.

       I spent an hour and a half last night watching the bad movie "Rollerball". I probably should have gone to bed on time instead. I got the impression that the plot had been sucked dry long before anyone got pen to paper, and the whole thing felt rushed (not surprising, considering the short length). One thing that did impress me, though, was the night-time car chase that was actually filmed at night with infra-red cameras. It wasn't enough to save the movie, but did stand out.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Current mood: numb. PPS - It's my blog and "numb" can be a mood if I want it to.

       In the absence of another love interest, I'm returning to someone who's already rejected me. She'd kill me for thinking this way, and to make things worse, I told her I was over her. I'm remembering little things I learned about her, too - some of them made me sad. I really can't be more specific in a public blog.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - She's a wonderful person, inside and out.

       Here's a paraphrased summary of an email I just received:  Hello everyone,  I've been using your new software for a month and it sucks. I just tried it on a brand-new fast PC and it still sucks. I couldn't generate a report because you suck. The current software doesn't suck nearly as much as you do. Your software is way too slow, which sucks, and you need to make it fast before we spend any more money on it.  Your software sucks because it's not like what I have right now. Even if you work really hard, I think it will still suck.  Big Accountant Guy  To be fair, the report generation is slow. To bite back, I have a few points:  The computer that actually needs upgrading is the server, not his desktop  The previous software is far more limited than our reporting engine and only generates pieces of the report on demand  Big Accountant Guy thinks the old software is fast because it only generates a hundredth of the data and returns that, then gets the next hundredth when he asks for that.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - If we don't get this fixed, the project could be axed. PPS - On the plus side, that would mean I don't have to deal with accountants for a while.

       I did the weekly grocery shopping last night (only because Dad, who usually does it, is in Russia) and I hardly had to buy anything. I think it's because all our family friends assume that my brother and I can't feed ourselves, so we've been supplied with free ready-cooked meals all week. I think I'd rather be cooking, if only because I perpetuate the idea by accepting the meals.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I'm even finding it tough to get through all the food we've been given. PPS - I may be buying a car soon, for less than I expected to pay.

       Browsing through  urlLink Mini-ITX.com , I'm often struck by the thought that this is how computers should look. I'm sick of beige (or black or silver) boxes with giant monitors, cables everywhere and ugly peripherals. Computers are meant to be tiny, powerful and, if they're visible, they should be pleasing to the eye.  Ideally, your computer should integrate so well with your house (or other habitat) that it is entirely invisible and you hardly notice it. Failing that, it should at least look good. I doubt there are many computer manufacturers worldwide who aim to make their cases out of polished wood or in truly appealing shapes that differ from the standard box.

I skanked through the whole Half Way Out set, so I was dripping with sweat by the end. It was a great time.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I just would have liked to stick around for Crying Out Loud.

       It's unusual for me to post on a weekend, but this morning has left me with something to say. My father left for Russia today, to go visit a missionary and help build playgrounds with some other members of the church. I won't see him for two and a half weeks. The odd thing about this is that when we said goodbye, we shook hands. It was more of a farewell between acquainted adults than a father-son interaction. I guess we're not close, and I always knew it, but it's not something you want driven home quite so obviously.

       I'm a fan of the Brisbane ska-rock band  urlLink Gerald , and have been for a while. Recently, though, I think I made the jump from casual fan (and friend of two members) to scary groupie. I think it was at AGMF this year that I crossed over, at least in the mind of the band. It was the second Gerald show I'd been to in just over a week, and I saw Ben, Dave and Adam talking to someone outside afterwards. I said "Hey, guys. Good set." and kept walking, but thought a second later "Man, what kind of freak am I?". See, it had occurred to me that I'm a non-musician using music lingo who actually has nothing to say to the band, and I still said it.  Mokalus of Borg  PS -  My motivation behind the spontaneous remark can only be the mild insanity of a groupie. PPS - Then again, maybe I'm over-analysing things just a bit.

       There are a few things you should and should not do when you are attempting to catch a bus home after a long day of work. For easier digestion, I shall present them here in point form.  1. Leave work with enough time to get to the bus stop without rushing. 2. If you bump into a friend on your way to the stop, keep your conversation brief, even if she  is  cute. 3. When your bus arrives, even if you're rushed, take a few seconds to check whether it is the right bus. 4. If you happen to get on the wrong bus, get off as soon as possible instead of waiting on board "just in case" it gets closer to your destination instead of dumping you in the middle of bloody nowhere.  By following these simple rules, as I usually do, you can avoid the embarrassment of calling home and trying not to use the words "wrong bus" within earshot of the other passengers.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - No matter how often we do something right, we just might do it wrong next time. PPS - I dub this "Mokalus's Rule of Practiced Idiocy".

       It's been a while since I had a Tuesday night free. Last night I used it to play Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. Every time I looked at the clock I was surprised by how long it had been since I looked last. I'm very grateful for the KI device from the expansion pack, because it allows me to export and import screenshots to carry around. I don't need to take paper notes anymore - I take digital photographs in the game, make some notes on them with Paint, and return to the game. It's all too easy.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Well, even though I say "easy", I've actually only completed two out of four Ages. PPS - And I'm sure I've been everywhere I can in one of the other two.

       I think I'm overdue for a proper holiday. Long weekends are good, if you can spend them relaxing. I seem to choose to spend them with friends in long sessions. I can't turn down an invitation to hang out watching movies and playing console games, but my body would much rather rest. I'm a bit divided between being an introvert and an extrovert - I can't tell whether I recharge by myself or by being with others. It seems that when the company is really good and prolonged I feel great afterwards, or when I get as much time as I need to just sleep in and relax, doing nothing, I also feel good. It's this sort of in-between socialising that drains me. Seeing my friends in short bursts throughout the week just wears me down. I need something different. I need more than a day (perhaps more than a weekend) with people I love, or I need to be by myself for just as long.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Sometimes I'm not sure if I know myself at all. PPS - And then I get too busy to notice anymore.

       The other day I saw my first episode of "Faking It". The basic premise of the show is to take a person out of their regular job and give them a crash course in something completely different. Then they place the impostor alongside a few genuine articles and get a panel of judges to see if they can spot the phoney. The episode I saw had a New York lawyer transformed into a pro wrestler by the name of "Psycho T". Usually I'm opposed to all things pro wrestling, but I do respect the amount of physical ability these performers have.  I love the idea of showing just how adaptable human beings are. You can rip a person out of their day-to-day routine and put them in a completely new situation for just a few weeks, and they're already adapting. Give it a year of the same treatment and I think you'd find the transformation to be just about complete.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - "Psycho T" fooled 2 of the 3 judges. PPS - I think he got to keep his mullet hair extensions.

       This is getting a bit nuts right here:  urlLink MSNBC - Cloning pets: In search of Fluffy 2.0 . I know you can love a pet very much, and I know you can want to have them back, but you always get over it eventually when they die. What happens when "Fluffy 2.0" dies? We'll probably clone it again. And again. Hell, we could have the same pet for our entire lifetime, and never have to deal with loss or death - ever!

       Yesterday I got to see firsthand just how terrified of public speaking my Dad is. He had to stand up in church and talk about his trip to Russia. About halfway through, it started to sound like he had no tongue. Apparently, his mouth had dried up completely. I think it's because he was standing there thinking "I really don't want to be up here talking right now", and his body just kind of granted his wish. I thought it was hilarious. Then he had to do it again in the evening.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - The air conditioning in the office is currently turning on and off loudly every ten seconds or so.

       It's a strange mentality I've observed now and then: the idea that, when a misunderstanding is occurring, each party needs to keep talking over the other to make sure their point of view is being communicated. Of course, all it creates is the impression that the other party is not listening, thus is not getting the message, and thus needs to be talked at more or louder.  I think it stems from a desire not just to express yourself, but to  be heard . Nobody wants to feel like their opinion is worthless, and unless you have a large audience hanging on your every word, it could feel a bit empty.  Two ears. One mouth. Shut up and listen once in a while. ;)  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I don't think I usually sound this disagreeable. PPS - I am prepared to listen to your feedback calmly and quietly.

       I think we are gradually moving towards the production of a tricorder-like device as our standard all-in-one mobile information and communications manager. Mobile phones and PDAs are gradually merging into one spectrum of computing power on communications and organisation devices. As for the Real Trek Experience, I doubt many of us would need atmospheric scanners, geiger counters or geological survey equipment on our handhelds. Perhaps they'd be add-on accessories for the die-hard weirdo. What most of us  would  like or employ on a regular basis would probably be about the same as what we have now, just to a greater degree, with a more powerful computer back-end and more available.

That's only a little bit odd, but take into account that I've known at least  three  other people who look just like this, and I'm sure there are more. I'm starting to gain more sympathy for Terry Pratchett's theory that there are only a certain number of people in the world, and you keep meeting the same ones over and over, no matter where you go.  So what's the explanation for all these lookalikes? Were they all cut from the same celestial mould, or is there some kind of natural shaping force at work that makes our faces and bodies gravitate towards a certain pre-defined set of looks, with fewer of bodies than there are people?

       I've been watching Big Brother (Australian season 4) and I've once again been struck by a desire to be in there myself. I'd say most of it is fuelled by a desire for attention, popularity and love (though I'd trade "a legion of adoring fans" for "love" if required).  Let me try to explain the problem: It takes a long time to get to know me properly (which is probably the case with everyone). By the time girls know me well enough to think I'm a decent relationship prospect, they're my good friends who are unwilling or unable to hook up. In BB, I think I'd be separated from the part where we become friends, and thus avoid that glitch in the process.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - It's so simple it's foolproof.

       (If you'll excuse me, I'm going to get a bit sarcastic now)  The difference between "proof" and "insistence" is known as "evidence". For instance, I have heard you on the radio this morning saying:  "The reason I keep saying there was a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that there  was  a connection."  This is despite the recent report finding that there was no collaboration between the two. This is an "insistence", and is empty. A "proof" would sound more like this:  "The reason I keep saying there was a connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda is that we found the following evidence to support that theory..."  See the difference? In the second case, you have some kind of basis for arguing, whereas the first provides only evidence of your own stubbornness.

       I've never been fond of static electric shocks, like when you've been walking on shaggy carpet on a dry day then you touch a doorknob and feel that zap. I hate it. Apparently, to some people, static shocks are tiny sparks that practically tickle. The ones I get are their big brothers, complete with bad haircut and missing teeth, ready to beat you up for your lunch money. They singe the hairs on the backs of my hands. I've felt like I'm standing in front of some tiny dark Jedi who hurls bolts of lightning at me.  To counteract this, I've developed a habit of touching every metal object I can find. And I mean everything - doorframes, filing cabinets, cubicle divider joins and that metal plate in that one guy's head. By doing this, I seem to have stemmed the constant onslaught of electricity that flows my way.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Instructional video on sale now. PPS - Just $19.99!

       I have a TV tuner in my PC that lets it act like a television, radio and VCR. Last night I set it to record a TV program, as I do, and I'd been using it to listen to radio. When I came back home I'd found that it had recorded an hour and a half of radio instead of television. I guess telling the program to record television wasn't a clear enough signal that I wanted it to  actually record a television signal . If it was an intelligent program, I could blame it for waking up and thinking "Right, I'm supposed to record television, but I'm in radio mode. I can't find the TV channel on the radio, so I'll just record radio instead". I can't blame it, because it didn't know what it was doing.  The person I  can  blame is the programmer who forgot to write the software in such a way that it would switch from radio to TV if it's supposed to record a TV signal. So I do.

       It's one thing to believe that I may be unattractive. It's quite another to obtain mathematical proof. According to the "golden ratio" and people who have studied it, my left eye is half a centimetre too low and my legs are 8 centimetres too short. The eye thing makes my face asymmetrical, which is unattractive.  Still, as much as I'd like to blame my romantic failures on such mathematical principles that are outside my control, I know I must accept some responsibility for the fact. I meet nobody. I interact poorly. Frankly, I  scare  people, and not like a rollercoaster or a slasher movie. I mean like discovering a severed head in your freezer.  Sometimes I'm okay with it. Sometimes, like now, I'm overtired and everything is just that little bit more intense. This time, for real, I need a couple of days off work.

       My father, for reasons best known to himself, has purchased a milk-like substance known as "PhysiCAL" and would like us to use it on our cereal from now on. Ug's comment on the subject was that it tastes "like water", and is clearly an inferior substitute. Besides taste deficiencies, the offending liquid also costs more than regular milk and offers only ethereal promises in return.  It seems to me that the dairy-phobic industry has yet to produce a milk-substitute that even tastes  slightly  like actual milk. Perhaps the difference is less pronounced for those of us raised on non-milk substances, but for our family it's always been your standard homogenised, pasteurised full cream. Anything else is the taste equivalent of Cinderella's ugly sisters.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - The Cinderella thing was the best metaphor I could concoct rapidly.

       I am currently, as I have been for the past four years, training in karate. To advance to a new belt, besides demonstrating a particular level of all-round proficiency, I must learn two "kata" - complex sequences of stances, blocks and strikes, performed against imaginary opponents. There are three other people in the class who know the kata I need to learn. Two of them teach the class, and their daughter is the third. She's about twelve, I guess. I never found out for sure. Anyway, yesterday I was being taught my kata by a child, and only then did I understand respect.  At the beginning and end of every class, we bow as a sign of respect to all the other students in the dojo. In what other context would a man have to respect a child enough to be actively taught by them? To listen when they say "you're doing that wrong"? To believe them when they say "it's better to do it this way"?  Mokalus of Borg  PS - There is always more to learn. PPS - There are always more ways to improve.

       My morning routine has been thrown off for the past couple of days by my Dad sleeping in. He swears he's not suffering jetlag. My brother, Ug, who never changes timezone,  is  suffering from jetlag. Specifically, "Gamer's Jetlag", also known as "Final Fantasy XI".  I'm getting well into Knights of the Old Republic, and I'm already wishing I'd spent my level-up points differently. I could really use some stealth ability right now. So far, although I'm enjoying it, I'm remembering the old adventure gamer's frustration. I  know  I have to get through that door. I  know  I need either identity papers or a Sith uniform. I thought I could find someone to help me at the cantina, just because it seems that's where you find shady characters to help you out. So far, I've found a really good way to get hurt and a card player who won't talk about anything else. There's a nut out in the street ranting about aliens and a few shops selling equipment I don't need or can't use.  To top things off, every now and then the game tells me that something is bothering my secondary party member, which prompts me to talk to him. Then we have an argument.

       I started playing "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" on the weekend. I think it's the first RPG I've played, ever. It got me thinking that this is where adventure games have gone. If you just take away stats and combat, it's a new-school adventure. If adventure gamers want new games, we'd better get used to other genres that provide adventure elements. We'd better be prepared to put up with some action and probably stat-building, too.  It can be a good thing. If I was a purist, I'd be screaming at me right now that adventures were the best genre ever, nothing can replace them, etc. Then the other half of me would tell me to shut up and deal. Then maybe a third part would step in, put and end to the fighting and buy us both some cake. And if I was a game developer, I just might sneak in an option to handle stats automatically. We can all get along.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - My brother, known online as "Ug the Caveman", thought I'd bought a Sims expansion.

       I'm reading through the entire  urlLink Penny Arcade  archive at the moment (I'm up to about October 2002) and, besides being very entertaining, it's bringing out the dormant gamer in me. I feel like I should be spending more time and money in Electronics Boutique and such places, sniffing out the best new games and whiling away my precious few leisure moments each day playing them out.  Or maybe I should finish Uru first.  The point is that I was once a gamer - action, adventure, puzzle and even, God forbid, FPS. Now that I have so little time, I tend to spend it on television instead of games, which is, quite frankly, no good for me at all.

       The signalled pedestrian crossings here in Australia, for the most part, include an audible signal as well as the visual "Walk/Don't Walk" sign. We presume this is for blind people, but it could just as easily be a way to weed out those of us without higher-brain functions. I have come to this conclusion because we have been conditioned to start crossing the road when we hear the beeps - a Pavlovian response.    The problem comes when the same sound is heard at an intersection for a different direction, which usually means the traffic would run you over if you tried to cross then. I see many people start to take steps when they hear the signal for the wrong crossing, and I've even seen someone start on their way, then run the rest of the way across the road to avoid looking stupid. Personally, I don't think that plan was quite successful, even if he didn't get hurt in the attempt.    Mokalus of Borg    PS - The safest bet is probably to recondition yourself to cross on the combination of audio and visual signals.  PPS - Or just close your eyes and trust to luck.

       Birch, Carrol and Coyle gift certificates and pre-purchased discount tickets are (for reasons best known to the money-grubbers themselves) not valid on Saturdays after 5pm. I could almost understand it for the discount ticket books, but arent gift vouchers supposed to be just like store-specific cash?   Their prices are also alarming. At Cineplex, the most you will pay for an adult ticket is $AUD7.90. That's absolute maximum - they get cheaper at certain times. At BCC, the only way to get into a movie for the same price is to gather up   four hundred and ninety-nine   of your closest friends, all with student concession cards, and buy your tickets in bulk. Then you get in for $AUD7.80. If you need adult tickets, it can't be done. The absolute minimum adult ticket price at BCC is $AUD9.00, and that's if you buy ten thousand tickets or more.

       While reading  urlLink the latest P3P working draft  I started thinking about online privacy and how it could be enforced by a browser. My first thought is that the browser could just keep a list of personal information that you want to be kept private (so that it's never sent in any outgoing packets at all) or that you want to be warned about.    It sounds simple enough, but there are always issues. Two that come to mind are a potentially significant performance hit as the browser scans outgoing packets for personal information, and the local storage of that data which may be vulnerable to cracks and exploits in another branch of the information privacy war. Though I doubt that the majority of the information would be of much use to scanners, email addresses would definitely be among the protected strings, and these are very highly prized by bots. One more possibility is the accidental blocking of legitimate packets that just happen to include blocked strings by accident - a false positive.    Mokalus of Borg    PS - It's an idea, all the same, even if it's one that could use some work.  PPS - It's probably small enough to be made as a browser plug-in.

It's been a while since I've lost my time sense to a game like that. My experience so far has been quite positive, though I've run out of empty enhancement slots in my inventory. I can't use them, can't throw them away, and I can't trade them fast enough. Even if I could, I'd be getting others that I can't use in return.

       On Sunday, I helped Tavia perform a skit at both morning and evening church services to promote Missions Weekend, the big event in the missionary committee calendar. Apparently, it went over quite well. I also registered to go on the Wintercamp early next month.  Monday was slow progress at work. I ran into a performance dead-end in my program. I noted that, in a way, I'll be glad when Big Brother is over for the year and I can have six more hours per week for games.  Tuesday I did a little bug hunting at work, which was good to break up the monotony. I also started designing a completely new user interface for my program, because the existing one is too slow and cumbersome to be useful. I wouldn't use it if I didn't have to, so I'm sure others will keep away, too.  Wednesday I continued tinkering with the new interface, taking the time to get it right. I don't really have that time to spare, so progress is slow. I saw  I, Robot  for free, thanks to Murrae and Stu, and loved it. It's not entirely true to the stories, but it should at least appeal to today's audiences.  Thursday I decided I should write a book. Specifically, a personal management and good-practice textbook for programmers. I think I've learned enough in two years of real-world work to write some of it down.  On Friday, we took the youth group kids to see Shrek 2 in the city. Unfortunately for us, various factors combined to make it one of the most expensive things we've ever done with them. They paid only $5 each, and we spent just over $10 per kid.  Saturday was a huge night out, by my recent standards. I helped Kym celebrate her birthday at the Sit Down Comedy Club, starting at 7pm. After the show, we stayed around the pub until about midnight, then four of us went to the Elephant and Wheelbarrow to see cover band Blah Blah Blah. I got home at about 2:15am.

       I got a chance to see a preview screening of "I, Robot" last night. Of course, since today is the official opening day, it wasn't much of a preview. I enjoyed it more than I anticipated, because my hopes were low after seeing the trailer. It turns out that this movie is not the actionfest portrayed by the trailer - this one's all story. I heard a fellow previewer afterwards complaining that there was "too much story and not enough action". To me, that's absurd, because movies  should  be about story, and this one is.

       Perhaps an award for "Least observant music fan" - I honestly didn't realise that the Black Eyed Peas' song "Let's Get It Started" was just the clean radio edit of "Let's Get Retarded". In my defence, I hadn't heard them both - that would have  really  been bad. I'd heard the Started version and had heard my friends mention how awful Retarded was, but just didn't make the connection until Channel Ten started using Retarded over their promos for The OC.    As for the title of this post, I usually prefer to leave these references half-said. This one is a misquoted song lyric.    Mokalus of Borg    PS - You could call me a prude or whatever, but I prefer the clean edit.  PPS - Maybe I'm just biased towards the one I heard first.

       Maybe I'm biased, but I consider human life more valuable than animal life. So, naturally, when I hear some woman on the radio complaining that a baby whale has drowned while trapped in a shark net, I get on edge. When she advocates that we remove the life-saving shark nets so that our marine wildlife will be safe, I stop listening.    Mokalus of Borg    PS - The relative values of human life to animal life are not negotiable to me.  PPS - Just my 2c.

       At some point in your life, you will probably need a computer programmer to do something, and you will need to be more specific than you think. Make sure that you say the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  If you make an assumption when telling a programmer what to do, you must, at the very least, tell the programmer that you have made an assumption. Consciously assuming, say, that report columns can be rearranged by the user, is a problem for the programmer, because we can't read minds. We can't read the documents you write to explain your requirements to us - how can we possibly glean extra information from your head?  The rule is this: if you think of a requirement that is obvious and need not be stated, write it down anyway. It's going to take you five seconds and save both of us at least a week of development time.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Our project is now one year late because of "obvious" unstated requirements. PPS - We hates them.

       Last Sunday I missed Ashalea's eviction from Big Brother because I forgot to check how long the double eviction would run. This upset me a bit, because Ashalea was my favourite of the remaining housemates. I also thought that it's not fair for someone (not saying who) to be so great, still single, close by and completely uninterested. On Monday I felt like I achieved very little at work. I should have taken a longer break back when I could, or should have grabbed more sleep. I wanted to spend more time around my friends, just to relax and chat. Tuesday I tried chicken teriyaki sushi for lunch. I got three rolls, though one and a half would have been enough. I struggled through all three and felt quite ill. I got a little break from my regular work routine when I had to hunt down a bug in our graduate application website. Apparently the frame that Hotmail uses to display external links prevented the site security from working, so we had very few applicants proceed past the registration phase. Wednesday I missed the Brisbane auditions on Australian Idol because of a bug in the VCR software I use. I did set it to record for an extra hour, but that only takes effect after another change has been made. I also came to the conclusion that the Professional 2 project at work is possibly too all-encompassing to actually work. Thursday I realised I'd been getting carried away thinking too much about Kym, though it was nice for a while to have someone else on my mind besides ... my previous interest. I got frustrated with my part of Professional 2, also, because I find it difficult to truly reach harmony between the design and the execution. I often find this is true of projects where I am responsible for a user interface. Friday I discussed a security model with Brad and started knocking out some new code to handle it at a low level. I'm not sure it will be entirely capable of carrying that load, though. Also had the first night of youth group, and the kids were definitely a handful. They just could not sit still or be quiet to hear instructions. My entire Saturday morning disappeared before I knew it, what with sleeping in, exercise and television. For most of the afternoon I played  urlLink KOTOR  and watched movies. We also went to the local Thai restaurant to belatedly celebrate my birthday with just the family.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Overall, I felt tired and unmotivated this week. PPS - Now I have more sleeping to do.

       Well, it's happened: I've officially stepped over the line from adventure gamer to RPG player. Last night in my KOTOR session I went hunting for experience points purely to level up. Then I kept going because it's extremely cool to see someone fight with a lightsaber, casually deflecting blaster bolts while closing the distance to cut you in half. I've only clocked just over 11 hours of play time and already I know this game is going to be very good to me.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I think it will at least hold me off City of Heroes for a while. PPS - Although I will inevitably end up playing that, too.

       I dreamed last night that I had to evacuate the office building and I wound up in a concrete fire stairwell with no exit. I was still one floor too high, and I could see that there were other stairs that kept going down, but these ones just ended in a brick wall. I'm sure it means something, in a subconscious way.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Today I am tired, run-down and unmotivated. PPS - Those probably all count as synonyms.

       I've been debating whether to order a copy of  urlLink City of Heroes . Undoubtedly it would be plenty of fun and worth the money - the question is whether I have the time to play it. As I've mentioned before, internet time is currently a scarce commodity in our house, and my suggestion to buy a router was summarily dismissed on the grounds that Final Fantasy XI (and, allegedly, all MMOs) won't run through it. It makes little difference anyway - there's only one box in the house that is equipped both to play the game and connect to the net. Sigh.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I could, of course, buy it with the hope that I will  one day  get a chance to play. PPS - At least the manual would occupy me for a while, but I've already downloaded a copy of that from the CoH website.

       It's always dangerous for me to read things like this:  urlLink The Code Project - UI & UA Changes on the road to Longhorn - .NET . I classify it as danger because I almost get excited about  Microsoft products  (a definite hacker no-no) and I start developing grandiose software design ideas. These ideas can easily overtake all my current (more important) work, purely in a search for a way to get programmers to write better software.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I hope this doesn't mean I'm becoming more of a manager than a programmer. PPS - Because it will still be a few years before I even get near a grey suit.

       I celebrated my 25th birthday on the weekend and planned to get together with everyone I know. I intended to accomplish this feat by taking them to a movie and paying for everyone. Apparently, though, some people were confused or wary about the words "free movie", and only eight showed up. In one sense, I'm okay with that, because it cost me less. On the other hand, it annoys me, mostly because I have no explanation from anyone who didn't show up.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I suppose, in their defence, I only advertised the event rather late. PPS - And I never followed up on anyone, either.

       Hehe, uh, yeah. Forgot to do this on time, but it's still here:   The Sunday Mok  I got only a few hours sleep on Saturday, and still somehow managed to get through the day. I expected to have trouble staying awake, especially during the sermon at church in the morning. Played more  urlLink KOTOR  in the afternoon, and got more into it still. After supper at the evening service, it seems everyone had gone home early, so I had to walk back home. Monday, just by chance, I heard about the wrongful  urlLink Big Brother  eviction at lunchtime, got some details on the web, and saw the re-entry that night. I resolved again to try to get into the next Big Brother house. Tuesday there was more KOTOR on the cards, and I got stuck at the rancor in the sewers. I felt a bit of acid reflux all day, which should have stopped me having lunch, at least. It didn't. I don't want such a big gut, even if it's not grossly prominent. On Wednesday the head of our corporate IT team, Dean, arrived in Brisbane for some reason or other. I was never quite sure what it was all about, though I assume internal politics had something to do with it. We've started having to defend our budget to the board of directors, since our schedule keeps on slipping. Got an invite to Kym's birthday bash, and my  urlLink Rookie  CD arrived. I was definitely looking forward to seeing Kym more than anyone else who might show up to my own birthday on Saturday. Thursday I felt very near the end of my work on the project, which would be a huge relief to everyone. I also spent some time tweaking our test harness for usability. It still needs work. I looked for a CSS way of doing rounded border corners in web pages and learned that it's a  urlLink CSS3 feature  - CSS3 is still a working draft and not yet implemented by anyone. Friday night there was no youth group, so I took the chance to check out  urlLink Jake 2.0  on TV and play (guess) more KOTOR. Had pizza for lunch and forgot to ask for no anchovies because I had trouble pronouncing the Italian name of the pizza. I also found the Mozilla-specific CSS extension that allows rounded borders. Saturday I took some friends out to see  urlLink Spiderman 2  - my shout. In the morning I had my hair cut by Renee at the local barber shop. I went to school with her, though she doesn't remember me. She's cute & petit; I've always liked that. At the movie I was so glad to be around Kym that I followed her like a puppy or something. It was weird to see, especially when it seemed like I had no control over my own behaviour. She had to leave before dinner, which we ate at a place called  urlLink Noodle Obsessions . Quite good Chinese food, especially the Mongolian beef.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I'll try to remember to do this on time in future. PPS - I've just got to make it part of my regular routine.

       I've come into the office this morning to find my desk and its various paraphernalia covered in a thin film of dust. Looks like I've been gone for years. I imagine it's quite like Rip van Winkle must have felt. I have yet to properly identify the cause of the dust invasion. My first impression is that somehow the air conditioning vent just nearby has had a large pile of dust gathering inside it, that has just been blown out overnight. That would have looked kind of cool.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - It also looks like several ceiling tiles have been replaced, which probably knocked down a lot of dust. PPS - It's clogging up our computer case fans, too.

       Just one of those moronic things that occur to us at the office: betting on gambling. Some of my colleagues gamble on sports for reasons I won't go into here (m'hay) and apparently one of the "sports" they can place wagers on is poker. Poker being a gambler's game, it seems odd to gamble on it. It only took us a second to come up with something more ridiculous: placing bets on the final bookie's odds on horse racing.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I wouldn't want to be the one trying to run it. PPS - But, as has been pointed out, people would still place bets even if they knew it was fixed.

       I made a little time to play Knights of the Old Republic last night and I've just encountered a giant rancor beast that far outclasses my entire party of adventurers. It struck me (an idea, not the rancor) just then that I'm two or three steps removed from my primary goal on this mission. In short, I am trying to sneak past a rancor to get into a gang hideout to steal back an already-stolen swoop bike so I can enter a race in the hope of winning as a prize the person for whom I am searching. There could be an easier way in real life.  As for the rancor, it seems only one character I control has the skills to successfully sneak past the beast, at which point I am again outclassed by two shielded gang members in a confined space. The rancor is still behind me, a guarded door in front of me, and I have to stay invisible to stay alive. I'll figure it out eventually, of course. It's just that it always seems confusing and frustrating until I do.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Until real life gets more exciting, this is probably the kind of post you can expect. PPS - Except for  The Sunday Mok , of course.

       Last night, due to a voting mis-count, the latest Big Brother evictee, Bree, was returned to the house. The phone company that handles the phone voting stated "human error" as the cause. I'm sure it's cost them plenty in bad press, time and cold hard cash, but they did act with honesty and integrity. I like Eddie Izzard's comment on admitting wrongdoing - sometimes we do it just so people will think "My, what a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.". I doubt the phone company is similarly motivated, though.  I also watched Faking It - the second episode I've ever seen. They turned a shy junkyard worker into a catwalk model. I wondered later if they ever choose a profession that  doesn't  involve some performance aspect. I wouldn't think so, because it takes a bit of performance to make good television.  At the enthusiastic recommendation of a co-worker and the fact that Foxtel is currently giving away the Comedy Channel for free, I watched Conan O'Brian and I don't think I'll bother in future. Having not had the pleasure before, I'd have to say he's a very strange looking guy. His face is just about flat from the front, like he was pressed hard against a wall until his head reshaped. He only made me laugh with "If They Mated". The rest was hardly worth my time. I expected a little more energy. I hardly think the opinion of one Australian will matter, though. Especially since I didn't watch in the first place and don't have the chance to watch later.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I left after that, just as Naked News was starting up. PPS - I wonder how long my Dad watched that before changing channels or switching off. Doesn't seem like his kind of show.

       I've had a bit more time to play Knights of the Old Republic now, and I'm getting to enjoy it far more than I expected when I started. The Star Wars backdrop is probably helping me get into it, but it's more than just liking Star Wars or puzzle-solving. Before too long I may even go hunting for experience points just to advance levels and skills. Truthfully, I don't make that much time to play. I spend my free time on Big Brother or movies, and at the moment my free time consists of Monday nights, Saturdays and Sunday afternoons. I sleep on Saturday mornings and Sundays, and I've been seeing plenty of movies lately, which I usually do on Saturday afternoon. Monday nights is Big Brother weekly nominations for eviction which takes an hour and a half, and Saturday evenings is often a video night. Any remaining free time in the week is typically needed for sleep.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - The game says my total playing time so far is just under six hours. PPS - And I'm pretty sure I bought it over a month ago.

       I've decided to start summarising my paper journal here every Sunday partly as a way of keeping any of my friends appraised of my current situation, but also for added content. So I give you the first ever edition of:  The Sunday Mok  Routine church service on Sunday, including Dad's stage fright performance. In the afternoon I attended the farewell service for Richard. At the evening service, I sang and performed in a skit. That's three services, and it made me miss my usual Sunday afternoon sleep. My LED light inside my computer has broken, so now the window on the side of the case just looks in on a few boring circuit boards. It could be a while before I replace it - I've got heaps of other stuff I'm saving for. Monday I watched "Faking it" and Big Brother. I liked Faking It enough to keep watching in coming weeks, and observed some familiar behaviour in BB - a last-ditch romantic effort to get someone's attention that just ends up with humiliation. Tuesday I felt like I got back into the work routine after two days off, but still felt like I was doing less work than I should have been. Made a little progress. Bus ticket prices went down by $4.80 per week for me. Wednesday - still feel like I'm slacking off at work. Decided to start the Sunday posts here. Bought "Fallen" by Evanesence and "Peach Pit Politics" by Rookie. Still waiting for the Rookie CD to arrive by post. Had a youth leadership development meeting tonight with Jane and the rest of the youth group leaders. Noticed how Michelle is getting energised for the church. Thursday I felt like I'd temporarily run out of ideas for my weekday blog posts. Until then I'd had a backlog of ideas that I'd been running through at the rate of one per day. The "rich client" software started to fall to bits. It's a massive tangle of data, events, controls and rules. I don't want to have to keep working on it. I noted my tendency to use any and all change in my pockets to buy food from the vending machine. Friday I managed not to buy anything from the vending machine. I bumped into Lyn, a friend from church who has since moved to another church. Her kids are both getting married, and she seems to be always interested in my love life in a way nobody else is. It's nice to be able to talk about it sometimes. Planned out the coming term of youth group programs along with the SLAM leaders. Ate way too much pizza. Found that Star Wars: Attack of the Clones is playing on Showtime on Monday night, and planned to record it. Saturday I bought Buffy season 2 on DVD and stayed out until 02:00 watching videos and playing Bomberman and Tetris - good retrogaming. Saw Chris for the first time in ages and learned that he's hooked up with a girl he mentioned ages ago. I've been a bit out of touch since he stopped writing to his LiveJournal.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I think this will work well. PPS - The format may change a bit as I get more used to this.

       Things seem simpler in fiction. Social interaction can come down to just saying the one right phrase at the one right time. We have  missions  or  adventures  which, though difficult, are easier to deal with than day-to-day life. There are rarely more than three people involved in a love polygon. If there are more than three, there are  lots , and it's played for laughs. Everyone knows how everyone feels, and love blossoms in the blink of an eye. We overcome the odds. Complications iron out. Villains lose, heroes win. There is never a long and arduous cleanup operation after the victory.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I am rarely certain which one I prefer. PPS - Probably fiction.

       I think I've worked out why this software project is (a) taking so long and (b) sucking the life out of me. We were supposed to be delivering a beta product this week, and we're still taking requirements even as we continue coding. If you believe my university lecturers, any changes we encounter here will cost about 1000 times as much to fix now as they would have if we'd got all the requirements at the beginning. And we  always  find new changes to make when we go through another round of late requirements.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Today my eye started twitching involuntarily. PPS - Not kidding.

       Yesterday I read (skimmed) a research paper called  urlLink Unskilled and Unaware of It , and it's been playing on my mind ever since. The basic point is this: you need certain skills to recognise those same skills, either in others or yourself. Otherwise, you are likely to consider yourself to be far above your actual level of skill. Ignorance, rather than wisdom, is more often the cause of confidence.  I have, naturally enough, been trying to figure out the skills in which I might be deficient, even if I believe I am adequately competent. I have come to the conclusion that I am magnificent in every way, which was a relief. ;)  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I have known people who have below-average senses of humour.

       Last night at karate (a non-contact club, mind you) I was punched in the nose. There was a little blood - only a few drops, so it wasn't all that bad. It is the second time I remember bleeding there. I can't remember if the first time was due to a punch or not.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I should expect stuff like this to happen.

       I read  urlLink this post  on SlashDot and thought it might be indicating an article about the coming personal digital device revolution where we all carry around a phone-PDA-iPod-GPS-hard drive. Then I skimmed  urlLink the indicated article  which seems to be more about a disagreement between RealNetworks and Apple over the rights to interact with iPods.  In a hacker's ideal world (and by "hacker" I mean "programmer"), we all use interoperable standards. The iPod wouldn't be the issue at stake, as such, because it would use the one universal managed music format that is freely available to everyone. RealNetworks and Apple would both be providing a service of downloadable music for a fee, and the disagreement would likely be over content theft or the rights to a certain label's music. See the difference? You can do what you like with your content, but the  protocol  must be open. That's how we create better competition and serve our users properly, because what they want is the music, not the method.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I acknowledge that it is often difficult to create a standard that fits everyone's needs. PPS - Most of the time, though, we don't even try.

       Just a little observation I've made recently: people who take joy in forms of destruction (explosions, demolitions, smashing things, car crashes) are almost never the people who take joy in forms of creation (design, painting, cooking, writing). It could be that these just represent two kinds of personality, like introverts and extraverts. Some people would blame different interests. I think it goes deeper, down to the core of whether you identify with the light or dark side of The Force, so to speak. If it's fun to smash things and you watch shows like "When Buildings Fall Down", it's possible you're on your way to being the next Darth Vader.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - I took a break from City of Heroes yesterday. PPS - In practice, that meant playing for only two hours.

       Although I was scheduled for a very busy day on Sunday, I came down with a head cold, so I just attended church services. I skipped a lunch event, a charity walk and a karate seminar. This was also the day that I started playing  urlLink City of Heroes . On Monday I missed the entire Big Brother final eviction because of a bug in Pinnacle PCTV Pro. I have since found out that the file is corrupted and will still play under certain limited circumstances. My Aunt and Uncle came over for dinner, too, which was unexpected, even though I had apparently been notified in advance. I thought about Saturday night and Kym a bit, too, because she demonstrated a knowledge of and concern for my beliefs that had not been mentioned that night. I almost called in sick on Tuesday, then soldiered on after clearing my head of the mucus that had built up overnight. I did stay home from karate, though. At work I started a significant redesign of the bulk data entry web service, because it was not equipped to handle some new demands. My head cold continued on Wednesday (and is, in fact, still going right now). I missed no work during the week. The Youth Leadership Development training at night made me uneasy about my role, because we were discussing the need to be proficient in areas where I know I definitely lack skills. On Thursday afternoon we had a power outage for an hour. Most of our section went home fairly quickly, but the power did come back on in time to resume work. I stayed. At night, I created my second City of Heroes character - a magical blaster called The Bane Mage. Friday I actually started writing the new web service. I took time to design it properly, which pinpointed the trouble spots and let me informally specify them. I'm doing this one by the book, just to see if it really does keep costs and development time down. The youth group program for the night was based on The Apprentice, which worked rather well. On Saturday I filled most of my day with City of Heroes (I can quit any time I want) and also trekked out to the Garden City Megaplex to see Shaolin Soccer. Shaolin Soccer is, by far, the best kung-fu sports comedy ever. I do think that it could have been written a bit better, though.  Mokalus of Borg  PS - Then again, without poor writing, how would we know it's a kung-fu movie? PPS - I mean, apart from the kicking, punching, jumping and screaming.
