      This blog will contain MOC (Microsoft Official Curriculum) courseware resources for the classes that I teach.  For more information about me, please see my profile and  urlLink technical blog .  I've been looking for a way to publish resources about the classes that I teach that would be flexible enough, and this blog will play a big part in that...

      What a great time I had this past weekend.  Let's begin with Friday:    Friday - 7/25/2004    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started Friday teaching M2559 to a group of 14 people.  We had a great class that week, and were able to end things a little bit early.  I managed to make it to skydive chicago and get 2 jumps in after class!  The first jump was just a solo sit-fly attempt.  I didn't do that well sitting, but it was great to be back in the air.  I also downsized to a Sabre2 150 from a Steletto 170.  I'll be trying a Steletto 150 next weekend if I can find some cash.  Quite the speedy landings from a 150 with my body weight.  The second dive, I did another sit-fly attempt this time with Dawn.  We didn't stay together for more than a few seconds, but since we were the last ones out, we got some free stills from Rook on the way down.  One of those stills made it to the SDC Photo Gallery  urlLink here .    Saturday - 7/26/2004    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an early friday night, I was up bright and early, and ready to jump.  I signed up for the "New Way" boogie that was going on.  I ended up in a group with TJ our coach, my friend Jim Bloomingdale, and Chuck on camera.  5 dives were made, all 3 way attempts.  We nailed 3 out of the 5 exits, but Jim seemed to backslide as soon as we broke.  There was some great video that I may have time to digitize soon.  I did 5 jumps with Jim and TJ, then did 2 solo jumps as well.  The second was especially neat.  Scott Miller was doing his canopy course, so we dropped quite a few people on a bad spot 2 miles out.  Only a 4 way and I remained to full altitude.  The 4 way exited first, and I gave them 10 seconds before I exited with my normal flipping routine.  I transitioned to a solid sit, and actually caught up to the 4 way pretty fast.  I was even with them by 7000 feet, and flipped onto my belly to watch.  What an absolutly amazing dive.  Rook gave me some advice about sitting up straight, and it helped considerably.  The night was quite a party.  Jack Daniels is bad....  Lets just leave it at that.  This was my last day skydiving for the weekend, so the entry ends here as well.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I'm Gentry Bieker, and this is my skydiving blog.  I started skydiving when I did my first tandem jump at  urlLink Skydive Chicago  on April 2nd, 2004.  I haven't been able to quit thinking about it daily since then.  I'm completely addicted.   I don't think I could stop of I tried.  It's hard to put into words my feelings about the sport, but I'm going to try to do it here over time.  I also need a place to daydream about skydiving, and journal my career in the sport.  As of last weekend (June 13), I have 37 jumps logged.  I also brought my mother Rebecca and my brother Andrew out for the weekend.  My mom did 2 jumps on Saturday.  She told me it was the greatest experience of her life.  I'm pretty sure those were her words.  My brother Andrew was able to fly the plane to altitude for her second, and my 37th jump.  I'm glad he had the guts to ask!  If you ever go, make sure to budget an extra hundred bucks for the video.  It's worth EVERY PENNY.  The guys at SkyCam are amazing in all aspects of arial photography and video editing.  You recieve a 6 minute video dubbed to music, and professionally edited with visual effects that will blow your mind.  I'll find the time soon to post my mom's video as a sample.  I truly regret not having my Tandem jump videotaped.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started on Friday, April 2nd with 2 tandem jumps.  I was back the next day with $1800 in hand for the full AFP package.   15 jumps, all with videotape and expert coaching.  I went through ground school on that Saturday, and did AFP Levels 1-5 on Sunday.  The experience at SDC is second to none.  I was lucky enough to jump with each of the 4 full time AFP Instructors.  I felt honored to be coached by the two owners of the Drop Zone,  urlLink Rook  and  urlLink Missy  for several of my AFP jumps.   urlLink Dave Cicciarelli  was the instructor that I logged the most jumps with.  He also took my mother on her first Tandem.  The man has over 12,000 jumps logged and is absolutly AMAZING.  He has a true love for the sport.  I also jumped several times with  urlLink Nanette .  Imagine a person with the most energy, joy, and passion you've seen that you've ever seen, and and then triple it.  That's Nanette.  And Nanette, if you're reading this...  We still need to drink some of that graduation tequlia (Don Julio of course!) ;)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm especially interested in canopy piloting, belly flying, and freeflying, and one day hope to become a tandem master.  It was the greatest feeling to introduce my mother to the sport, and I hope to introduce many others.  If you're thinking about your first jump and aren't quite sure, just visit SDC.  The people there are one of the greatest aspects.  Everyone will go out of their way to make you and your guests feel completely welcome and at ease.  If you're licensed, and looking for a someone to jump with, find me!  I'll jump with just about anyone.  By next season, I should even be able to help you out with a place to stay.  I've just got to move my RV up there and find a slot.  It's beginning to get late, and I'm starting to get tired.  It's been a long weekend.  So...  ... To Be Continued

      Lately, I've been pondering the idea of writing a global favorites system.  Lately, I've been coming across so many resources in my day to day reading.  Since I'm also a trainer some of the time, I really would love to share these with my students.  I would also love to have people submit links.  I think I would need two interfaces to this at a minimum.     1) IE Favorites (Anyone could have read access, but only I have write access) probably via a plugin.    2) Web Interface (for my personal site) with the capability of allowing people to submit links for approval)  I also would need the ability to keep everything in sync between IE and the Favorites database.  Before I write this, I just want to make sure I'm not re-inventing the wheel.  I've done very little searching so far, but haven't found anything that completely meets my needs yet.    I think the back end really should be an XML Web Service.  At this point, these are just thoughts for further investigation though...  Have you already seen such a system?  Leave me a comment!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my Blog!   As the description reads, this is my technical blog.  I've been telling myself I would start blogging ever since I discovered RSS.  That was about 8 months ago.  I'm very glad that I've finally gotten around to it.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad brought home a computer when I was 5.  It was a  Commodore 64 .  That was when my addiction started.  When I was 15, I finally managed to break into the technology industry.  I got my work permit, and ended up finding a job in technical support at Northern Indiana Internet Access.  Tim Schlie hired me, and I will be forever greatful to him for that.  He taught me quite a bit about UNIX and Linux System administration.  The best thing about working at an ISP was having access to the T-1.  Especially once they gave me keys.  A little over a year later, I moved to Crown.Net.  Dave Bellar and I were a 2 person ISP.  Crown.Net was one of the funnest places that I worked.  The phone that we swung around to each other and shared was one of the neatest perks of any tech support job.  2 people with 1 phone!  I still miss my  urlLink desk  with my Sparc 20 workstation, my IBM Thinkpad with the butterfly keyboard, and of course my Sun 3/60...  Slowpoke.  She still lives somewhere in my fathers house being used as a table, I think.  It's hard to get around to reviving her when I've got my UltraSparc these days...  I also started to work with Windows NT quite a bit.  I decided I would get some training for my MCSE.  Life was quite a whirlwind after that.  ... To Be Continued
