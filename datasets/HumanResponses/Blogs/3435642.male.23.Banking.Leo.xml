      Yes!! I managed to get myself a gmail account. I am so excited. After two full days of searching, I finally bought one off of ebay for $45. If you ask me it is money well spent. The way I look at it is this, if I get an invitation I can just sell it on ebay and make my money back. I am so excited to have 1 GB of memory. I have been telling everyone that I know, they are all like, "what is a gmail account?" Oh, the unlightened. It is kind of funny because I keep checking it over and over in hopes that I will have email, the only problem is that only like 5 people know my address, so I have not gotten any mail yet, but I am still excited about it. I think that everyone should have a gmail account.

      Today is my first day of work. It is very exciting. To think that I am actually going to work in the real world. No more summer jobs, I am going to get paid. Keep checking back to see how the transition takes place from excited college graduate jumping into the workplace to disgruntled employee who hates his boss ;). I just keep thinking about the movie, "Office Space" for some reason. I think that I should get a job with google, that would never get boring. Not only that, but I could get a gmail account. I think I will look into that. Check back on how the process is going.

      I have been wanting a gmail account since I heard about it. I have emailed google multiple times requesting one, I have posted a swap for 20,000 songs for a gmail account. I am even considering giving a kidney for a gmail invitation!! I don't want to do this, but a gmail account would be incredible. I would be the perfect candidate to try it out also, right now I have three different email addresses in order to get all of my email. I have about 30 MB's of disk space between the three accounts, this just does not cut it. I need something bigger. Please send me an invitation. wanne83@hotmail.com

      Today is my first day of work at my new job. I just graduated college and I am ready to take on the world. I am doing an internship this summer with a bulge bracket(large) investment banking firm in Dallas, Texas. I am excited about the opportunity and hope to learn as much as I can. This blog is set up to chronicle my experiences for the summer. All of the successes and failures, the good times and the bad. I hope that this blog will also be informative to anyone who is considering Investment Banking as a career. Check back as I will be updating it periodically. If you have any specific questions please email from my profile and I will try to answer them as best I can. Enjoy.
