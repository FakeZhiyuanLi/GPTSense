        Merlin Johnson did not want to be on a boat in the middle of the sea. "You'll love it!" His step-dad had said. Now, in the midst of nothing but blue, Merlin was nothing but bored.   "Are we there yet?" he asked.   "Not yet man." replied the captain, a tall swarthy man in his late 30's.   Merlin let out a deep sigh. Why did i say yes? he silently asks himself. the gentle rocking of the boat was beginning to make him sick, so he started to go belowdecks. All of a sudden, he saw out of the corner of his eye a glittering green flash. What was that? he questions. He scrambles back to the edge to get another glimpse of what that flash was. Try as he might, nothing interesting appears, just a few fish being pursued by a large blue jellyfish. Was that a mermaid, he says to himself, intrigued. That would be so cool.   "we're here!" yells the captain. "See that tiny island? best fishing spot in all of the world. Some say Its even blessed by the hand of God himself!"   They get all the gear unloaded, from the fishing rods to the tents. "would u like to fish first, or get the tents up?" asks the Captain.    "Uh, i guess we'll fish first." answers Merlin. So they break out the beach chairs, long-handled nets, fishing poles, and lawn gnomes.   "whats the deal with the lawn gnomes?" Asks merlin, confusedly.   "they say it brings good luck to fisherman." answers the captain.   "oh." replies Merlin, still not fully understanding.   Hours go by. The captain catches everything from angel fish, to jellyfish, to shark. Meanwhile, Merlin is looking forlorn, dejected, and disappointed. "not a single fish! not even an anemone." Merlin says to himself, his face downcast.  "cheer up sport. Give it one more shot!" encourages the captain.   "well, alright." Merlin reluctantly agrees, reeling in his line.   Whizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz goes the line, out into the deep. Almost as soon as the line hits the water, he feels the line grow taut. "Ive got one, ive got one!" he cries euphorically. "Its a big one! its a really big one! wow! i dont know if i can hold it! I-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!"    Suddenly, Merlin is pulled off of his feet, and is flying towards the spot where his line is! My fingers are glude to the line! he thinks frantically to himself. I cant let go! oh no... here comes the water!   Splash! down he goes, down down down. Whats going on?! He wonders, panicked. Suddenly, he sees the flash from earlier on the boat. It's a mermaid! Forgetting he's underwater, Merlin's eyes grow wide and jaw drops. Wa-was that a, a mermaid?! he wonders,  awestruck. What the hell is this place?   He starts to look around and notices that Mermaids are just the beginning. Aside from the fish, theres also a leviathan, a giant glowing squid, and a humongous sea snake. All Merlin can do is let out a small squeak of disbelief and awe.   As all this is going on, Merlin is still descending through the sea. All of a sudden, he finds himself in a large, gazebo-like building, each with a different colored pillar at each corner. Red, blue, purple, brown, black, and white. "Where am i?" Merlin wonders aloud.   "chosen one!" A large, loud voice booms.   "wah! Who said that?!" merlins cries, almost falling down from shock.   "i have been waiting for you for many years. the time has come for me to pass along my knowledge to the next generation. what is thy name, o chosen one?"   "merlin! my name is merlin!" he shouts, still bewildered.   Light shoots from the white pillar to right in front of Merlin. Soon, all the other pillars had shot out light. In front of Merlin, bathed on the light of the six different pillars, floated a glowing staff.   "Merlin, the time has come for you to fulfill your destiny! take that staff in thy hand, and with it bring a new age to the world!" boomed the voice. "go forth, and revolutionize!"   Merlin, frightened and apprehensive, reaches out and touches the staff. An awesome power shoots up his arm, down his feet, and into his head. His feet lift off the ground, and he feels a power and a peace like none before. he realizes that it's what he has been searching for, been longing for, been wishing for for so long. He knows that this is his destiny, his fate.    He grips the staff, and starts rising off the ground. "thank you, great spirit. thank you." he says, as he ascends to the surface, to meet his destiny, and to shape the destiny of the world.
