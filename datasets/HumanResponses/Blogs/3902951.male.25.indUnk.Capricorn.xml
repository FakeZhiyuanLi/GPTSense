      Was a decent day. Only thought of her a couple times. I was listening to Elliot all day though, so it was still kind of melencholy.  Jen and i talked today. More of the same BS. Getting really fucking tired of the game. I think its time to walk from that fiasco.&nbsp; Grrrrr. I thought she was cool too.&nbsp; Oh well, easy come easy go i guess.  I am going back to the forum i decided. I am runnin a lot of raquetts and i need to get things straight.  Talked to Johnathan today at pool, started a really intersting conversation with him.&nbsp; he seemes rather pissed off at me for " fucking around " in my life. He said he can see SO much potential in me that i am too afraid of or somthing.&nbsp; He wants to talk more about it when he is sober.....i guess we will see.&nbsp; Might be interesting though....he made a few really good comments.....unnerving things.   Iceblink is coming over to suck my dick and talk about music. At least it will be nice to get a BJ.&nbsp; She is fucking psycho though....i have to walk a very thin line with her otherwise I am going to have a stalker on my hands.&nbsp; I may be a little to drunk to walk that str8 of a line tonite.&nbsp; I guess we shall see.

      I am constantly amazed at how much i hold back in life.&nbsp; How many times i want something but let the little voice in my head that preaches temperence to guide me. I was out camping this weekend and that thought hit me like an uppercut from Iron Mike.&nbsp;&nbsp; How many chances have i missed at life?&nbsp; Why is Narcissus denied.&nbsp; I mean for the love of god I am 25 and while i have had a pretty eventful and full life I always have felt like there was more i could do. More&nbsp;i could see. More i could learn.&nbsp; Maybe I should quit being so hard on myself and love the life that i have.&nbsp; Its hard when my life seems so empty to keep my head up though.&nbsp;   Therein lies the demon which i have been wrestling.&nbsp; So much has changed in my life over the past 8 months.... from everything that came with Landmark to everything that ended with Heather. Her image still haunts me while i sleep. And i dont know why i cant shake it. Its never been a problem before, all i had to do was go out and start dating again. SO why isnt it working this time?!!!! My heart skips a beat when i see someone who even REMOTELY resembles her. And "they" ALL resemble her.&nbsp; She is in soooooo many ways the person i want to be with, and at the same time soooo many ways NOT the person.&nbsp; It could also be the fact that we are apart i guess.... Everything looks perfect from far away.&nbsp; It was easier to come up with reasons why we dont work when we were together.&nbsp; As for the landmark thing.....it amazes me that I am 100x more open about things. I do my best to stay off the raquettes, and if anything it only helps to contribute to my loneliness and feelings of being discontected from the world.&nbsp; Actually i should say that i stay "off" it with other people....all those things just have become focused inward.&nbsp;   Its late....and i am tired. I am going to TRY and sleep tonite. Wish me luck  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       In a conversation the other night i was asked about the number of sexual partners i have had.&nbsp;As usual the number seemed to bother the person.&nbsp;And once again for some unknown reason i felt like i was being persecuted for my past.&nbsp;That really isn't what bothered me though. I have become accustomed to that. What bothered me is that i could not answer the question that fell like a lead brick into my mind after the conversation.    "why i have just recently changed my tune."     &nbsp;   &nbsp;I have few regrets about my sexual past. Minus 2 or three women i have not felt like i was lying about my intentions. Nor was i ever pushy or demanding.&nbsp; I have always tried to maintain a certain level of decorum and civility with the people.     &nbsp;   So why am i feeling drawn towards some sort of Victorian code when it comes to sex lately? Is it something that comes with age? If so why is there a pre programmed "nesting" instinct that hits at 25? Biologically there doesn't seem to be much of a founding for it. It is better biologically speaking for me to continue having sexual relations with as many women as possible. Thus increasing my chances of passing on my genetic code.     &nbsp;   In another conversation regarding this topic, someone offered the reason of Emotional Maturity.&nbsp; As if one can actually mature emotionally. Maturation is almost by definition a physical process. So are we to say that a person will naturally progress through certain emotional states in a static world? If that were the case why would we not all progress at somewhat equal levels? Something tells me that there is something else guiding this "maturity" outside of nature.     &nbsp;   So that leads me to sociological stimulus. Could it be the taboos of American society are finally wearing off on me? Has Norman Rockwell finally been deeply implanted into my psyche enough to show its face in my own musings? Possibly. But still not all that likely. It is rare that i am pulled into the stream without a conscious decision to do so.     &nbsp;   So WHAT then. Why is one partner preferable to several.     &nbsp;   When it comes down to it i think it is a comfortability.&nbsp; HAving been with one person for so long, maybe i am just uncomfortable with it because i cant predict it. I am not always going to be "successful". Maybe its the thought of&nbsp;being so successful that i wont be seen as anything&nbsp;but a good lay.&nbsp;ie... The woman would spend time with me ONLY for the sex.&nbsp;That last comment is rather indicative that i desire to be loved not only for any prowess i posses in the bedroom, but also for who i am as a person. So maybe I am collapsing the terms sex and love. That is rather odd for me. But it does seem to fit. Hmm....More things to think about now. I will write more about this later.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;
