						   My Dog is my Wingman (or am I hers?)   I am a dog person, I have a great dog. She's a 2 year old Golden mix that looks like a puppy and she is the most approachable and friendly thing on four legs. With my biped-self not too shabby on two, together we make a 6 legged, two headed, conversation starting duo. Nothing breaks ice better than a happy fuckin' dog. My dog introduces me to a new person almost everyday. This is good and bad.   I live downtown on Gay Street (save the jokes, I have either heard it or come up with one myself that's better than yours) and twice daily we make that special and extensive journey to seek out the absolute perfect place to crap; that soft, grassy, and elusive Fecal Nirvana. It's usually found on the grassy patch on Market Square where all the patio diners at Tomato Head Cafe can watch me pick up and bag her "Enlightenment". There's nothing as flattering as playing pick-up-stix with a turd in front of a bunch of dining vegetarians. And it never fails that some attractive young co-ed wants to come up and chat as I am mid-way to the garbage can to toss the bag, making for a wonderfully awkward situation where I have to make small talk with a small white plastic bag of warm poo behind my back.   The thing I think is the funniest, is for months I have been coming in and out of my building, saying "hi" to females and occasionally getting the polite return "hi" and smile. As a guy, I don't expect much more than a courteous smile from women, anything else is considered "flirting" by the average guy and leads to mild stalking. But with my dog, it's a whole new story. Instead, my dog comes right up grinning and its "Oh my god! She's so cute!" and "How old is she?" or "What kind of dog?"etc. The only thing that has more effect is a newborn baby. But a dog has a distinct advantage as an Icebreaker for a single guy: the explanation of where you got your dog is much simpler than where you got a new born baby.   So I meet lots of people with my dog, one of whom is sometimes the female half of a couple. Generally while Girl-friend is petting and scratching my pooch, I am forced to make small talk with Boy-friend giving me the stink eye. Unless of course he is also a dog person, then he is down on his knees playing with my dog making baby talk. That's always pretty funny, when they stand up they have this embarrassed look on their face.   The people my dog always attracts are the crazies, she fuckin' loves the crazies. The crazier the better; the person making the most noise and the least amount of sense is the one my dog wants to go up to the most. They usually have the funkiest, stank smell too. "I think your dog likes me. You like me don't you, don't you pup!" they say as they put their face down and kiss her. "Yup, she really likes you" I say, never pointing out she "really liked" the leaky trash can a block back, the dead bird two blocks back, and the hard piece of turd at the park as much as she is "liking" you right now. Instead I make small talk which usually leads me to coming up with an excuse as to why I have no change or cigarettes.   So now I am thinking "who is who's Wingman here?" One of the perks of having a happy fuckin' dog is to break the ice with people, especially those attractive ones of the opposite sex. But now I am starting to think I am HER Wingman. After all, while she is getting to 1st and 2nd bases (i.e. tongue kissing and heavy petting) I get to make small talk with someone totally uninterested in me. Oh well, that's what happens to us all when we hang out with people (or animals) cuter than us. They get all the attention.   Bitches.     "The greatest pleasure of a dog is that you may -make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you, but he will make a fool of himself too. " - Samuel Butler   "No one appreciates the very special genius of your conversation as much as your dog does." - Christopher Morley   "I've seen a look in dogs' eyes, a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt, and I am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts." - John Steinbeck  "It's no coincidence that man's best friend cannot talk." - Mark Twain

						   I may be citified now, but I have riden horses, shot guns, and made passes at extended family members in my youth, all pass times of small town livin'.  As the product of Westerners, I have been hearing and using simple Cowboy proverbs all my life. Grandparents on both sides of my family were farmers and ranchers in southeastern Washington State. Not that I am a cowboy, having long ago disappointed the men in my family with my city-boy ways. I have known many a John-Wayne-Confucian in my life, here are some things I heard growing up and other bits of farm knowledge. Some I wish I had listened to better:  Never approach a bull from the front, a horse from the rear, or a fool from any direction.  Don't squat with your spurs on.  Don't judge people by their relatives.  Behind every successful rancher is a wife who works in town.  When you lose, don't lose the lesson.  Talk slowly, think quickly.  Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.  Live a good, honorable life. Then when you get older  and think back, you'll enjoy it a second time.  Don't interfere with something that ain't botherin' you none.  Timing has a lot to do with the outcome of a rain dance.  It's better to be a has-been than a never-was.  If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop diggin'.  If it don't seem like it's worth the effort, it probably ain't.  It don't take a genius to spot a goat in a flock of sheep.  Sometimes you get and sometimes you get got.  The biggest troublemaker you'll probably ever have to deal  with watches you shave his face in the mirror every morning.  Never ask a barber if you need a haircut.  If you get to thinkin' you're a person of some  influence, try orderin' somebody else's dog around.  Don't worry about bitin' off more'n you can chew;  your mouth is probably a whole lot bigger'n you think.  Always drink upstream from the herd.  Generally, you ain't learnin' nothing when your mouth's a-jawin'.  Tellin' a man to git lost and makin' him  do it are two entirely different propositions.  If you're ridin' ahead of the herd, take a look back  every now and then to make sure it's still there with ya.  Good judgment comes from experience,  and a lotta that comes from bad judgment.  When you give a personal lesson in meanness to a critter  or to a person, don't be surprised if they learn their lesson.  When you're throwin' your weight around, be  ready to have it thrown around by somebody else.  Lettin' the cat outta the bag is a whole lot easier than puttin' it back.  Always take a good look at what you're about to eat. It's not so important to know what it is, but it's sure crucial to know what it was.  The quickest way to double your money is  to fold it over and put it back into your pocket.  You can't tell how good a man or a watermelon is 'til they get thumped. (Character shows up best when tested.)  Never miss a good chance to shut up.

						   After bouncing around MySpace and Lavalife, I have noticed that most of the guys have pictures of them flexing their arms, stomaches, chest or something else. Many of the shots include props and costuming, like bandanas, motorcycles, farm equipment, etc. And need I mention the "Fuckin'-A I am one hot Man-imal!" look on their face, which is very close to the "I have to take a monster piss and/or crap" face.  I am new to the male dating photo experience. Normally when I am online I am seeking girls, not dudes, so I have no idea what the other single men are throwing up on their profiles. Now when I check out a really attractive picture of a gorgeous woman, there are half a dozen comments below attached from some beefcakes with really clever insights into their appreciation for female beauty. You know, like: "Holy shit your fine!", "I think you are soooo hot", and the always popular and timeless "DAMN!!!". Now with some clubby chick named Sexxxy Sara", hanging her ass out in every pic, with a headline "Party Girl, wuz-up?", i would expect it from the chest bearing meatheads. But naive me, I didn't know all attractive woman online were subjected to so many insightful compliments and endearing love notes. No wonder I don't get many responses on Match, i need to bumb up the Alpha juice!  So I decided I need some really great, pseudo-homo-erotic, beef cake pics of myself with out a shirt and flexing some major muscle groups. Maybe get a nice fake tan two shades shy of an Umpa-loompa. But I need some props for the full effect. Maybe I can wear just overalls with one strap off, holding a pitchfork and wiping sweat off my brow, like some photographer making a Playgirl calander stumbled onto my farm and snapped a pic of sexy ole me doing my daily chores. But I don't live on a farm.  Or I could get a shot of me coming out of the surf, with glistening droplets of dew hanging off my man-hooters, and carrying a surf board (always remember the prop), but careful not to look directly at the camera lest I appear to be posing. Phsheeahhh, like I would pose. But I am landlocked, no beaches here.  I could do the very popular bandana, baggy jeans, washboard abs, and be making the two-handed downward facing "Peace" sign in front of my ride. Better yet, take it in front of my blank living room wall of my modest and undecorated apartment at the Rancho-Villa-Club Buena Vista Arms/Meadow/Landings/Commons/Condos/whatever-silly-name they chose for my poorly themed apartment community.And in all of these sexy posed-so-I-don't-look-like-I-am-posing digital shots of my hunkiness, I must have the "Christ! Does a man get hotter than me?!" look on my face; which is, incidentally just like my "why did I eat the whole Chimmichanga last-night" face.  That's much better than a picture of, say, a B & W of about what I look like as I write this in my office. Or (god forbid) the classic head shot with a nice smile. No, no, no, that won't close the deal. No man-cleavage to taunt the ladies with. I need a full body shot showing my meatiness complete with a Conan the Barbarian fur loincloth and boots, in front of my pimped ride, my requisite shades and bandana properly placed, also carefully NOT looking directly at my snickering roomate snapping my pic while I make the sexy-man face and flex my guns. Then I can post sexy things like:  "Hey hotness, can I email you sometime?",  "Holla at me sweety.",  and of course,  "DAMNNN!!!"    "Not everybody trusts paintings but people believe photographs." -Ansel Adams"  If it's true that men are such beasts, this must account for the fact that most women are animal lovers." -Doris Day
