      I think it's pollen.  How did I get so lucky to have spring twice this year???  "Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper, super duper..."  Ah, Taco...

      I've been enormously musical lately.  And not in the sense that I'm working as a therapist, as I did for a while and had limited time for myself musically.  Rather I've had time to indulge my musical needs.  I've played the guitar for at least 2 hours each day for the past few weeks... I'm finding I'm only thinking of about 8 songs, and needing to look up others in my book for inspiration.  I've also been in the mood for old Ani DiFranco songs (from the first 2 albums) because they're so simple with just her and a guitar, and not that penchant for horns she's had for the past few years.  And I'm ALWAYS startled when I hear "Pictures of You" (Cure, not AD) in a commercial for HP.  But it makes me bust out my Disintegration  album, and sends me back to that place I don't necessarily want to be...  However, in travesty notes, I just today learned that my Disintegration CD is nearly destroyed with skips and scratches of unknown origin.  I think I have to buy a new one.  Of all things, I might be ready to look for an open mic that doesn't necessarily get on you for playing covers for your whole set.  Fantastic lightning show today.

      I'm really obsessed with Chipotle's guacamole... I wish I had a better vehicle for it than their chips.  Of course it's not at all like Annie's guacamole, but I can at least get it in Colorado.  So Annie, come make me guacamole.  And I've seen 2 Wahoo's fish tacos here... That's just bizarre since you could only get it in LA and OC, in Boulder and Broomfield, CO, but not the IE??

      So, I've started wearing my carpal tunnel braces while I sleep again.  I forget that when I go through periods of sleeplessness, this often helps, because I usually bend my wrists into the dreaded position when I sleep, causing tingling and discomfort bordering on pain.  Driving to CO aggravated it again.  Last night I dutifully put on my right brace (usually gives me more trouble than the left), and woke up in the middle of the night with my hand right hand all a-tingle.  I had removed the brace during sleep, and put it in my closet and shut my closet door.  I didn't know it was in my closet until this morning when I went to get dressed.  This concerns me.  I'm not a sleepwalker, and I'm a light sleeper.  Does someone need to confess to breaking in, taking off my brace and hiding it in the closet without disturbing me or Ernie?  Or am I just becoming somnambulent?

      So, I got to visit my mom and sister briefly in the anomaly that is Denver International Airport.  It's got these crazy tent poles and it's REALLY bright inside.  But I had an early birthday celebration which included my family sating my crazy orange compulsions by giving me an orange patent leather tote.  It's sort of in-between sizes of a purse and a tote, but it was handy because I could stick my book I was reading whilst waiting for them in it, as well as the handheld milk frother they gave me so I could make my own lattes (or au laits since I don't have an espresso machine).  All in all it was a short visit, a nice visit, and a good visit.  And I went outside to the parking garage (I was on the top level) and since it's waaaay out in the middle of nowhere, it looks like you can just see forever.  And forever is evidently bordered by the lovely, snowcapped Rockies.  The sky was a goregeous shade of blue, the wind was cool and refreshing (if not a bit pesky and kept trying to blow my skirt up), and it was 72 lovely, sunny degrees.  When it's 72 degrees, I always think of the Kids in the Hall movie Brain Candy: Gleemonex makes it like it's 72 degrees in your head... all the time.  Last night I taught myself something new:  I set a zipper in my skirt that I'd been altering since it's too big.  Could I have just bought the skirt in the right size?  Of course, but that'd be logical.  It came out pretty well for a first zipper and since I don't have a zipper foot for my sewing machine, it's relatively close to the coil, and combined with the altering, the skirt doesn't fall down anymore.  It's my favorite skirt.  If you happened to receive that email, it's the one I was wearing this Sunday when I spilled coffee all over it and had to change (into blue capris, if you're curious).  Here's a job that's posted but I won't apply for:  Seeking Will Smith, Gloria Estefon and Bette Midler look a likes   I just had a slightly sad but good conversation with my favorite 89-year old woman.  Among other things we talked about how parents (typically) raise you to become independent people who live happy, fulfilled lives.  And then she started talking about how it's very sad to outlive everyone you've ever grown up with, and that's she's ready to go "whenever the Good Lord decides I'm done futzing around this place."  All her friends, husband, siblings, cousins, and entire peer group are just gone.  Which made me sad for her.  She's been alive since 1915.  WWI, WWII, Abolition, Roaring 20's, the Great Depression, Facism, the Spanish Civil War...  All of these things she was alive for.  THat's just fricking remarkable.  This is WAY more nutshell than I wanted to be about this, bt it's too long (we talked for about 2 hours) to synopsize any more than what I already have.  But it kept bringing me back to a song my friend Colleen wrote in college  ("Grandma died 2 weeks ago, she raised her soul up to the sky.  But she was ready, you know she lived a long and trialed life.  Born in 1901, she'd seen so many changes in her life, social worker, music teacher, mother of 8 children, and of course she was a good wife.  But in the days, the hours, the minutes before she lifted up her soul, she prayed to the Good Lord that he would finally come and take her home.")  A lighter part of the conversation was about the movie Chicago, with which she wasn't duly impressed, but she liekd the jazzy music, especially better than some of the music they play these days.  "Like that hip hop.  They call mothers the most awful things in those songs."  I almost fell down it was so funny.    I'm tired of breaking out and finding grey hair.  (I don't find grey hair when I break out, those are two separate things I'm tired of)  My sister started breaking out again when she turned 30.  I have 3 more years (plus one day, if you're keeping track) before I should have to deal with that again.  And since I see millions of grey hair in the front, and can't see in the back, I can only imagine what's going on there.  I'd been on a strike of coloring my hair until I had to, but it's official.  I have to start coloring my hair.    Tomorrow, I'm getting a pedicure (and why not, dammit?  my birthday will be a perfect cube, why not get one?), playing fetch with the animal, baking a cake (please vote: chocolate or lemon?) and having some dinner with family.  A quiet day.  Maybe it'll be crowned by me getting a job.  The job I thought was in the bag didn't come through.  2 of my midwestern cousins are graduating from high school this year...  Wow... I remember when both of them were born... I am getting old.  Please pass the Geritol.

      Going back to Fred's  urlLink what do certain songs or artists remind you of post , all of Lincoln by TMBG (which is one of the few cassettes I have that still gets regularly circulated and listened to) always reminds me of Fred, Speckman, and the NOLA crowd.  And "Life is a placebo masquerading as a similie" is actually a metaphor.  I forget with whom I was arguing this, but it is.  It just contains a similie.  It's a funny day.  But not funny Ha Ha.  Just funny.  And although I slept normally last night, I have an unhappy sinking feeling in my stomach anyway.

      So, congratulations to my lovely friend  urlLink Jill, Esq.  for passing the bar exam and being able to hang up a shingle, work for ContraCosta County DA's office, or doing whatever int he world she feels like doing!  Last night a friend came out and we made tacos for my birthday.  (It's not my birthday, it's not today... Freddie, do you remember when it is yet?)  We also had some good conversation.  Which is immeasurable (although tacos are yummy they can be measured)  Among the topics that left me thinking after he left (and spilled over into the season finale of Alias) were the following: -Songwriting is hard.  I'm my own worst critic, and so maybe I should just sit down and write a song and not worry about it so much.  In fact just as I watched his feet pass my living room window (basement apt), I was overcome by this enormous urge to sit down with m guitar and try to fabricate what was whirling about in my busy little head, but the words didn't come out, and then Alias started.  I think I'll buy a bottle of wine and try again tonight. -Finding someone when you're not looking.  I've said it before and I'll say it again.  If I'm looking for someone to love me, it usually means I don't love myself enough...  It's when I'm doing all right with myself that I am actually more receptive to being involved with someone because I'm not thinking about me, I'm thinking about them.  And I just have to throw it out there, I think it's generally a really bad idea to get romantically involved with your roommates.  But that's just my (very rarely) humble opinion, and I could be not the most objective person in the world on this topic. -Spicy food is gooooooooood. -Gin makes me happy because it smells like Christmas trees, but I don't believe I can drink it straight anymore. -I love reading and thinking about what I've read. -I wish that I did like writing because I'd likely travel and write all of the dissertations I have floating about in my busy little head (there are currently 5 theses in 4 distinct academic areas).  I'd like to teach only at the university level because as horrible as it sounds, I'm not all that interested in making other people understand me. -Scrabble by yourself, while sad, is quite challenging because you're equally motivated to win, but you somehow find yourself leaning toward one of the several players you represent. -I'm all for looking for ways to get paid for what you think is fun so that you just really like your life.  (Hello, I got paid for playing guitar and singing, reading books and dancing with kids).  And I think that's one of the best ways ever to be ultimately happy in life. -Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen are geniuses of songwriting.  Their songs are almost always better when covered by someone else.  Paul Simon is a genius of songwriting and arranging and performing, and very rarely does a good Paul Simon song lack either good lyrics or good music... (and "Sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears" is possibly one of the most jaw-droppingly insightful and perfect lyrics I've ever heard) -There's way more but I need to move on.   So thanks for the good company and good food even though there was no wine to be had.  My aunt's cocker spaniel, Ollie, just got his spring haircut and they went a little nuts on his ear fur.  He also looks about 1/2 as big as he did before the haircut when all the other dogs in the field would point and laugh, saying "baaaaaa" to him.  He's sleeping next to me and has a rather impressive snore for a dog of his size.  I have had the worst time sleeping since I bought my bed 2 or 3 weeks ago.  I can't fall asleep, and when I do, I usually am wide awake by about 3 and I have been feeding into this cycle by taking naps to compensate for the 3 hours of sleep I'm getting and it's all a very vicious circle.  And it's been too blooming hot in my apartment because the heater's been kicking on (rather unnecessarily) and I have no control over the heater.  My mom and my sister have a layover in Denver on Wednesday, so I'm going to go out to the airport and visit with them.  This is the first trip that's been non-medically motivated my sister has taken since she got sick in Jan. '00.  The trip she took right before that, however was a doozy, and involved my family flying to New Orleans for my college graduation, we were all sick, my dad was in the hospital first in New Orleans, was expedited back to California and was re-admitted to Redlands Community Hospital that same night, I had to move out of my apartment that my roommates didn't help clean even a little, my mom and sister were SO sick with bronchitis that they took a cab to go 2 blocks down the street, and were lucky enough to see it SNOW in New Orleans as I took my car that was packed to the gills with my earthly posessions and I moved to Georgia.  All of this happened 6 days before Christmas.  When I finally moved in in Georgia, I had 2 days to collect myself, got on a plane and flew back to California.  I wonder how my dad will do in the 2 weeks he'll be alone.

      I really like the new Morrissey song that's been floating about the radio.  I've been a Morrissey/Smiths fan for years.  But isn't it weird that he's headlining Lollapalooza?

      It's another goregeous day in Denver.  I'm really quite happy here. I've decided that since I've had some spare time (i.e. everything I do is pretty much under this category) that I'm going to work really hard at being happy.  Happy doesn't always come easily to me.  Neither does relatively content.  But I'm investing time in myself.  By doing little things like adding stripey colorful pillows to my living room.  And using really nice  urlLink Philosophy skin care  products on my face.  And walking through my neighborhood on lovely days.  And as corny and 12-steppy as it sounds, counting my blessings and challenges every day.  It helps.  And rearranging my living room a whole bunch is quite cathartic as well.  Because it's not fun to be an unhappy person.  I've spent most of my adult life with at least a sense of malaise and discontent.  It's time for me to stop waiting to be happy and to just be happy, dammit.

      So, I had 3 job offers yesterday.  Only one of them seems feasible, and only for the short term, because it would cover my rent, my bills, and then I'd have to sit at home alone and not eat or drive anywhere.  But it's more than I'm making now.  I'm still holding out for the FBI job.  I'm hoping that I' haven't been disqualified from that one.  We'll see.

      I just met my match in the form of an 89=year old woman.  We just had a lovely conversation about religion and politics and where the twain should meet.  (The 2 topics never to bring up at Thanksgiving dinner)  It was spawned by Bishop Sheridan in Colorado Springs stating he would refuse communion to people on the basis of whether they vote for pro-choice, -euthanasia, -death penalty candidates.  Which, on the whole I do not support.  But then again, I surely don't agree with the Bishop on this particular point.  It becomes very dangerous to judge people in any circumstances, much less the level of their "sinfulness" which is such an internal state that it is difficult to see what lies within the hearts of others.  This is also assuming that all Catholics vote on the basis of "moral" platforms.  (I'm also one who thinks it's foolish to simply vote along party lines) While I'm not a fan of the death penalty or euthanasia or abortion, to be perfectly frank, it's such a small part of what I look at when I evaluate a candidate to govern for and on behalf of me.  The problems with these particular issues is that while legality makes it easier to condone each of these things, the actual change has to lie within the hearts of the people who go out to attain them.  I could go on, but I'm sure that I've already put up enough to create a minor maelstrom, and I won't have a chance to come back for a few days.  That's also assuming anyone's reading this.

      I'm glad it's a lovely day today.  After the icky snowy stuff yesterday and the day before, the sun looks lovely to me.  But I really wish I were asleep.  In my big comfy bed with my crazy doggy.  Because he's so warm and sleepy when it's sleepy time.  He always wants to be doing what everyone else is doing.  Even if that's laying down and not being awake.  Good thing he doesn't run with the drug crowd.  He'd be a junkie doggy with a tendency toward freebase and rolling.

       organized my cd's last night.  It was fun.  I know I'm a geek because I like to alphabetize.  Does it matter what?  No, just let me put it in alphabetical order.  There's always the tricky ones that cause me to stop and think:  MC Solaar.  M or S?  Is MC a title or a name?    Dave Matthews Band: M or D?  If it were DMB, Inc., I'd know it would be D.  But it isn't.  that's all I can think of at the present time, but there are more.  Maybe later.  I'm doing laundry at my aunt's house.  Ordinarily, I'd feel funny doing that, but they've begged me to, and I'm poor, and running out of clean skivvies.    I just got an email from a friend with mention of Oingo Boingo.  I don't know if I mentioned them in a post, in an email, or what, but it was really funny because just last night when Iw as organizing my cd's I threw Only A Lad in my cd player to help me work, and was listening to the song that reminds me of Camazotz (I get enough nutrition by eating protein biscits recommended by the system)  Salt Lake City also reminds me of Camazotz.

      So there's quite a bit happening.    My wonderful Jillianberry is in hospital with the flu.  Get better Jill!  I'm sending you mental flowers.  (daffodils and daisies, if you were curious)  I'm reall busy and not really on line during the week much.  It sort of sucks, but also keeps me from compulsively checking my email.  Let's all cross our toes and fingers that my Freddiefriend will be sent to Golden, CO by our good friends at Sharp.  Cause when we say Sharp, we mean business.  And if she does come out, we'll have a weekend to hang out AND we'll go to St. Kilian's cheese shop at 32nd and Lowell.  Maybe toss back a beer or two.  Or a vodka collins, who knows?  I saw the Broncos mascot Miles this weekend.    I saw a circus show in Copper Mtn, up in the Rocky Mtns.  It was a wonderufl drive, it was a lovely show, I saw my friend Cris who was dubbed the strong man.  One of the high points of the day was the two 10 year old girls who ran up to him after the show and said "How big are your muscles?"  One of the low points of the whole day was the hailstorm and driving rain that plagued my drive down the mountains.  There were quite a few high and low points to that trip.  And I took bunches of pictures (precisely 120) and as I get them posted, I'll let you know.  I found out my identity may have been stolen.  I hope not, but I wish whoever may have stolen it better luck than I've had in my time being me.  And I wish they would give me back.  I've got some mixed up feelings inside of me right now.  Some surprise, some sadness, some relief, some anger, and some frustration.  I just don't know what to think...  urlLink "tell you the truth, I prefer the worst of you..."  versus " urlLink I guess I just wanted you to see that it was all worth it to me..."   So we'll see I suppose.  All I know is I'm tired.

      So, I'm a busy lady.  I'm working in the President and CEO's office at Exempla St. Joseph Hospital in Denver.  I'm basically a really busy secreatary.  It's good that I'm busy, though because the work is a bit numbingly dull.  If I weren't so busy, it wouldn't be fun.   But I've also had a few other job offers thrown my way... which may wind up working out.  Because although I would love to play with brand new babies, and I could create my schedule to accomodate my schooling (instead of vice-versa), I won't have benefits or a guaranteed number of hours per week.   So I may see about taking a job as a unit secretary inb the hosital doing medical coding, transcription, etc... That'd be okay by me.  I'll even be able to work from 7-3, and take classes at 6 without worrying about making it on time because of traffic or whatever.  And always have weekends off.  So we'll see.  I babysat for the very first time on Wednesday.  I sat for Michael Clark (Jeannette and Jason's munchkin)and we played and had fun.  Then he got tired and cried himself to sleep.  It broke my heart.  But we sorted ourselves out.  I adore that kiddo.  I got a pedicure today, because I got paid.  And I got pink nail polish because I never do.  ME!  Pink!    So, that's about it for my news.  Annie, I would LOVE tor ead your Joe Vs... paper.  I think I asked you for it while you were writing it!   And please read I Am the Cheese!  It's a freaking weird book, but I liked it.  Oh!  David Foster Wallace has a new collection of short stories that is supposed to be wonderful!  So, that's on my list.  I keep reading.  and reading and reading...

      So, I used a power tool today.  I used an electric hedge clipper to ameliorate the wet branches slapping me in the face when I get home or let the dog out situation.  And I went a little nuts.  Cleanup was a bit of a problem because I have nothing along the lines of a rake or a push broom with which to pick up said clippings.  Since I'm not gardening-ly inclined (I had a plant once.  I had to give it up into foster care because I didn't feel like getting dirt on my hands to re-pot it) I also didn't know what was a shrubbery (if only Dennis the Shrubber were there...) and what was a weed.  So i cut back everything so clear a path.  And since I have no lawn mower (or really any lawn to speak of), I also used the clippers to cut down the height of the weeds in the back yard.  But again, since I have no rake, I'll leave them there until I can borrow one from my aunt (likely next weekend).    I did have one injury (minor as far as chainsaw-like power tools go): the vibration of the clippers gave me and popped a blister on my right middle finger.    I counted last night and since June 1,  I've read 11 novels .  They average about 400 pages apiece (minus the 650 pages or so of Infinite JEst I've read this month)  For those of you doing the math,  that's around 5,050 pages in June .  I'm desparately out of books to read (I have around 18 linear feet of novels and another 6-8 feet of references and text books), so please, feel free to throw a recommendation my way.

      So, in the move I lost the following things: A Mighty Wind DVD O Brother Where Art Thou DVD Mazzy Star  Among My Swan  CD  There's a very slim chance they're in some of the few things I've left to unpack.  But if not, I'll be sad.  I'm in the mood for Joe Vs. The Volcano today.  The job I have is going all right.  I'm basically an executive Assistant in the administrative offices of Exempla St. Joseph's Hospital.  (As I mentioned before it's where I was   born, so it's obviously a great place.) In this office, the President/CEO, and 5 Vice Presidents work, so there's a bunch of Big Honchos running around at all times, it's very busy, and keeps me from getting too bored.  But I'm glad it's a temp job and I won't be doing it forever.  For one thing, I have to wear closed toe shoes and nice clothes every day.  And I have to blow my hair dry.  And it's aggravating my carpal tunnel a BUNCH.  So all in all, it's meeting a need, but it's not forever.  Hopefully I'll be doing my postpartum caregiver training after this job ends and be hanging out with families with new babies for money!  Really, I'm seriously jonesing for Joe Vs. the Volcano.  I don't know why you're here and Daddy says not to tell me.  I'm a flibbertigibbet.

      Yahoo Mail just changed their overall look and it's startling, and will take some getting used to... However, they've also upped my storage from 6 mb to 100 mb, so instead of using 40% of my available storage, I'm only using 2%.  But whatever.  I don't know about that sort of stuff.  Tonight, I'm having a Clark Family Dinner.  I'll be having dinner with Jason and Jeannette Clark, their little son Michael, and in attendance will be their baby in utero.  It'll be nice.  Jason thought I'd like to have someone to watch the 5th (and possibly final) Lakers-Pistons game, so that I could cheer on the Lakers in good company.  I've never watched more than 4 consecutive minutes of basketball in my LIFE, so he said that if nothing else, at least Michael will be excited to have someone who will pay attention to him during the game.  I talked to Michael on the phone he said, "Hello."  "See you later." and "I love you."  There may have been some prompting from Jason, since he's 22 months old.  But he evidently lopves to sing and his favorite song is Happy Birthday.    In Heather's A Music Geek news, Happy Birthday is the 2nd most popular children's song of all time.  It makes sense.  The number 1 song?  The Itsy Bitsy Spider.  Or the Eensy Weensy Spider, depending on your particular school of thought.  I've been given a loaner Nokia phone to test in my signal unfriendly basement.  (Cris' Nokia worked at my house, but he has AT&T)  If it doesn't work, I'll have to switch providers in September... Or get a landline so I can be reached when I'm at home.  (strange, incomplete segue: my favorite part of  R&G Are Dead  is when they're playing Questions, and the sequence goes: What's your name? When I'm at home? Is it different when you're at home?)  I'm SUPER excited about a VH1 special that's on tonight: In Tune with Paul Simon and John Mayer.  I like John Mayer somewhat... But Paul Simon.  I think he is genius.  He's absolutely brilliant (and somewhat responsible for my obsession with Santa Fe... It doesn't have anything to do with  Newsies )  So, although I'll be at the Clarks house, my trusty VCR is taping it.  My favorite Paul Simon is impossible to nail down to one.  My favorite John Mayer song is "My Stupid Mouth" and it's because of that song that I have any sort of fondness for "Your Body's a Wonderland" because he layers "I'm never speaking up again" over the end chorus.  Otherwise, "Wonderland" really skeeves me out because I feel like such a voyeur... Which isn't what I like to feel like.    Ollie the Wonderdog (yesterday, however, I was lying in the hammock, and he was in the hammock, then he hopped off and lay down under the hammock, and I called him Ollie the Underdog) is sprawled in a most indecent fashion across the guest room bed at my aunt's house.  I really don't like Norah Jones all that much, but I sort of groove to "sunrise."  I've got a touch of logorrhea (go to  urlLink dictionary.com  if you don't know what that is, although you could figure it out if you've ever heard "In the beginning was the Logos and the Logos became man" from John 1:1 and know what means Logos.) so I'll sign off.  Yes, Catrina, I still cruise xanga.  I just don't post there anymore.  Sometimes I'll comment, though.  It's supposed to rain, and I was going to go back to Penny Lane's open mic tonight, but the rain adn the fact I'm going to the Clarks house has changed my plans.  Maybe Thursday.  I swear, I'm done now.

      I was in the process of compiling a list of lyrics that just make me feel happy inside and the computer crashed.  Let's try again:  "It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder." - Jeff Buckley  "As you tried to describe the taste of a mouth with a dream inside." - Great Lakes  "Well if you think of this girl and the dreams that made her, write your secrets on hornet's nest paper and blow it high across the border." - Dar Williams  "I've been wondering what you meant when you asked 'Do you have a light?'" - Ani  "Rings of flowers 'round your eyes and I love you for the rest of your life." - Neutral Milk Hotel  "'Cause it's written on the body, it's on the tip of our tongues." - Johnatha Brooke  "I love you oh so well like a kid loves candy and fresh snow  I love you oh so well enough to fill up heaven overflow and fill hell." - Dave Matthews  "we laughed because the world is absurd and beautiful and small." - Ani  "Sometimes even music cannot substitute for tears." - Paul Simon  There's a million more, but that's all for now.

      Man, I really wish I cycled with the moon... that'd be so chthonic!  And how often do we REALLY get to use that word in conversation?  Anyhow.  I had my interview today.  It sounds like unless I have an unknown crime in my past (which I may... read previous post) I'll get to work there, but I'll have to go through some training before I can work there regularly.  And I'll need to buy professional liability insurance for post-partum care givers.  So, we'll see.  My aunt is also trying to get me a job at her hospital doing medical coding.  Boring, but comes with a paycheck.  So, who knows?  My aunt just got home and her dog is so excited!  Ummm.. that's about all I've got for now.

      Not much coherence today, just random thoughts strung together:  I'm really moved by the funeral arrangements and commemorations for Pres. Reagan.  It's partly because it's the first president I remember (I don't remember the Carter years very well, being 0-3 years old).  The first presidential election I remember was the 84 when Mondale and Ferraro (I really wanted a female vp when I was 7) were running against Reagan and Bush.  I remember sitting in the Montessori playground talking about politics with Kortney Groves, Melissa Camacho, and Laura Greene... Although Pat Farley may or may not have been involved, too.  I guess I started into politics pretty early... I was a fan of Dukakis when I was 11, too.  Even though the 11 year old in me thought the pee slogan was clever: George Bush don't Dukakis.  It works better out loud.  Anyhow, I'm also moved enormously by Nancy Reagan.  I never had much interest in her when I was younger, but I do remember it being the first time I'd heard of breast cancer.  And while in so many ways, I can't help but think that his death was merciful from this debilitating disease (if you've never met and/or loved anyone with Alzheimer's it's truly more devastating than could be imagined), her obvious love and grief make me want to reach out to her in some way...  Moving on.  I'm still working on Mary's scarf... and I'm SO tired of pink by now.  I'm enamored of the Marcy Playground CD.  It makes me wonder why I waited 7 years to buy it.  I remember the first time I heard "Sex and Candy," I was in Toledo, OH (heaven save us) visiting my friend Dani from college in Boston, we were driving to the Toledo airport to pick up her sister and her sister's boyfriend (now ex-husband), and the song made Dani turn up the radio really loud and speed really fast.  But it does the same thing to me.  I had anoter weird dream about one of my kids from Pasadena.  She was totally one of my favorites, and when I first met her, you couldn't understand a word she said, and she'd jibberjabber ALL the time.  When she first learned to say "Heather" it came out as "Headyouuuuuuu" (someone said it sounded like she was speaking whale) but by the time I left, she was using wonderful sentences very appropriately, and when she didn't have the words she would use a sentence she knew that would sort of fit the bill.  Anyhow, I had a dream that I had to say goodbye to her again, which was hard, but her mom wanted me to come with them to pick out a bathing suit for her (the girl) and then we'd eat lunch at the food court in the big Target that was right behind my office.  There was something else, but I can't quite put my finger on it at the moment.  I had a message on my voice mail this morning from an Officer Someone with the Colorado State Police.  It was about making an appointment up to a week in advance, and he'd try the other number.  It was likely a wrong number, but I was afraid I'd forgotten something REALLY important... like  a crime I'd commited, or a court date, or something...  I hope I didn't.  I want a job.  I want a new computer.  I want to be back in school.  All things in their time, I suppose.

      So, I went to an open mic up in Boulder last night. I've been scouring the area for good ones, and so far have found 2 (note: typically stay away from open mics in bars, especially if you're near a college... the frat boys tend to do a lot of dave matthews covers, and since they're drunk, and dmb is hard to play, it doesn't turn out well).  I'm looking for ones wherein they don't chastise you for playing covers, but where there's a decent amount of original stuff, too.  But last night, I drove up to Boulder (it's about 1/2 hour), brought my knitting (see Mary, I haven't forgot the scarf which is only about 6 months late!), and a book, and settled in... There were only 2 people playing, both of whom didn't interest me much, and then they had a featured performer (which surprised me at an open mic) who played jazz guitar with a drummer.  I listened to him for about 30 minutes, and once the fabulous thunderstorm that I was watching for a good portion of the evening subsided enough, I went back to my car, and drove home watching the fantastic lightning show and trying to see the lines on the highway.  As far as open mics go, it was a little of this, a little of that.  I purposely went this week because a lot of the CU students would have gone home, and I'd get to see a bit more of the local talent.  I'll probably go again in a few weeks.  I'm going to the one at Common Grounds again tomorrow night.  I'm undecided as to whether I'll play or not.  I have a job interview Friday.  cross yer fingers.

      So, I've been having weird dreams again lately.  I can't remember them all, but last night's was VERY interesting (at least what I can remember):  My apartment was a strange combination f my current apartment, and my apartment in Maine... It had a MASSIVE bathroom situation.  There was a really nice sunken jaccuzi tub, a european shower, a dressing area (it was about as big as my apartment is now), with 2 dorrs leading off of it.  They led into a very strange little barn-themed extra bathroom with a huge shower/tub and 2 shower stalls, and off of this room, there was a room with a couch.  My sister was there.  I was taking care of a baby... Who looked a lot like Gonzo.  The Muppet.  But it wasn't a Gonzo creature, it was a different one. And all of a sudden, there was a helicopter searching for the baby I was watching in the room with the couch, and so I got off the couch, put the weird baby UNDER the couch, and in busts... Gonzo who thought it was his baby...   It was VERY hot last night, maybe that had something to do with it.    I had someone leave me a message on my phone yesterday about a job where I'd help parents of newborns adjust...  She said my resume and references looked great, the one area of need was: "I'm concerned about your lack of lactation experience."  I didn't know lactation was something that you could practice.  It's not really a voluntary action.

      There are thousands of moths that hang out at twilight. There might be 12, there may be millions, what with my inability to visually estimate numbers, but there's WAY too many of them around these days.  Last night I had to chase about 7 of them out via a complicated system of turning lights on and off in a path that led out the door.  It makes me think of a line from an Ani song (just bought "Evolve" which won a grammy for cover design - part of which is feeding into my moth horror, so it's on my mind... review to follow):  and there's this moth outside my kitchen door she's bonkers for that bare bulb flying round in circles bashing in her exoskull and out in the woods she navigates fine by the moon but get her around a light bulb and she's doomed   As far as what I think of the album, I still love what she does with the language and how she manipulates it to evoke great imagery and emotion.... but I just don't like where she's been headed musically the past 4-5 years... It's just a preference, but so much of her music embodies the contemporary/avant garde New Orleans Jazz sound that just drives me insane...  So, right now, I'm an advocate of her progression of a musician, her poetic brilliance, but not a huge musical fan these days.  Anyhow, it's hot today.  Yesterday I went to the People's Fair and roamed around.  It turns out I don't think that's fun when alone.  But I got some sunshine on my shoulders and the early awakenings of a tan... but that's not all that tricky for me to do.    No job.  Not much new.  Wait!  I got my hair cut and colored this weekend and finally put my caramel stripes around.  It took FOREVER (she was sort of new, but really good at what she does)... around 3 hours.  But as I had very few other plans, it was all good.  I am trying to evolve... I'm just trying to evolve...

      I went to the open mic at Common Grounds last night.  The person who was supposed to bring the sound system never showed up so it was truly acoustic.  I went for the sole purpose of casing and listening.  2 middle aged men (ex-hippies, one of whom tried very unflatteringly to hit on me by talking about my book and telling me how he's part of the system now since he bought a house and pays property taxes.  I didn't know he was hitting on me until his inebriated friend told me.  Either my radar's off, or he's really bad at it) who played Jimmy Buffet and Led Zepplin and some very bluesy original stuff, and a younger guy who did some (very good) DAve Matthews covers.  Maybe I SHOULD show up next week to throw some folk and estrogen in the mix.

      I got the new  urlLink Alanis Morissette  album a week or so ago.  I also have Under Rug Swept (why would you let Yoda title an angry girl album?).  And I've come to the following conclusion.  The songs by Alanis Morissette that I like, I really like.  The one's I dislike, I REALLY dislike.  And I tend to like 1-2 songs per album.  Cases in point:  Jagged Little Pill: "All I Really Want" makes me dance and stuff...  I really like the acoustic MTV Music awards version of "You Oughta Know" but it's really hard to find these days. (I haven't really tried, though)  Under Rug Swept: "So Unsexy" is the only song I like... Musically I like "Hands Clean" but it SO grosses me out that it sort of ruins it for me.  So-Called Chaos: I (gasp) love the single "Everything"  The rest of the album?  It drives me bananas.  I also can't stand that Los Lonley Boys "Heaven" song either.  Please keep in mind, that this is a process for me, and typically once I've made a definitive statement about disliking a song, I usually wind up loving it.  I'm almost finished reading E. Annie Proulx's Accordion Crimes.  It's much like The Shipping News in that I don't like it.  However, 2-3 years after I read The Shipping News, I had an uncontrollable urge to read it again, and I really liked it.  Maybe it's something I have to let stew for a few years?  I appear to not be able to commit to opinions.  Oh well.

      I was walking my dog, letting him... well have a poo, as it were, and I was up to my knees in the weeds and grasses in my backyard (unclear as to who is supposed to take care of it... although some mystery wonderful person mowed the front yard... thanks!), and I was reminded of Maine.  When I moved to Maine, in addition to my really hard, depressing job taking care of kids with mental illness and helping their families change their ways so they wouldn't be removed from their custody and thrown into the foster care system, I took a light, fun job during the fall and summer.  Or summer and fall, if you like things chronologically.  Anyhow, I digress.  I was working as an assistant to a photograper, and it being summer and fall in Maine, we did a ton of weddings.    The first wedding we did was an outdoor wedding, in a field, on a cliff, over the sea in Spruce Head, Maine.  It was an expensive wedding, the tent for the reception was lovely, and the day was a photographer's dream... slightly overcast, reducing the need for gobos, filters, etc, diffusing the light perfectly.  But as the bride walked across the field in her dress, got married, and whatnot, we were taking some close pictures of her and her husband.  And I decided right then and there that I'd NEVER have an outdoor wedding (I've never wanted one, so it wasn't a hardship).  The number of crickets crawling on and up her dress, between the lovely layers of organza, satin, and chiffon  really freaked me out.  If you've spent any significant time with me, you know I have a SERIOUS bug phobia... centered primaril around roaches and crickets... they make me want to barf.  So kids, before you decide to run across a field of daisies and get married up a tree (Yes, I know someone who did that), think about how close to nature you REALLY want to be in your lovely clothes.

      Typically, I don't like bugs.  But at Friday's, I love their Junebugs.  Yum.  So, today was my belated birthday pedicure.  it was the  urlLink BEST pedicure  I've ever had, complete with hot stone massage and pretty polish (yes, a lovely, sherbet-y shade of frosty orange), I needed a nap afterward.  So I took one.  Then I paid my rent, and now I'm online in Lakewood, CO.  But can we please review and find out how it's already June?  I suppose that's good because that means I'm starting school in 3 months, but, this year is flying by way too fast.

          So, today I pretend to have the life of an executive: arrive at  6:30 am, and stay until 6:30 or 7 pm.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; there've been quite a  few opportunities for me to roam outside (I had to walk to a nearby hospital a  few times to take pictures of doctors).&nbsp; But it was rather foolish to eat  lunch at my desk.&nbsp; but I've not yet had 30 minutes in a row to eat it, so  I'm eating it slowly over several hours.         &nbsp;     Ernie's been such a nice dog lately.&nbsp; A bit spazzy, but nice  nonetheless.&nbsp; Tonight he gets to run around the yard for a long, long  time.         &nbsp;     I have been on a picture taking kick lately.&nbsp; It really makes  me happy to take pictures of people (I'm a huge fan of skies, but otherwise, not  too interested in landscapes) and I love taking candid pictures of people doing  things that they love, because their passion is so evident on film.&nbsp; Ann,  my boss/friend thinks I'm A Photographer.&nbsp; Which makes me feel  weird.         &nbsp;     Okay I'm getting slammed at work, I have to  go.

         That's about all the reaction I can muster to today.       &nbsp;   Yesterday there was a chamber music concert for the doctors at the hospital.&nbsp; I got to listen.&nbsp; It was nice.But I was unwell with migraine-y auras... at least I was without the migraine.       &nbsp;    And I was looking forward to being paid while sipping vodka tonics and&nbsp; &nbsp;mingling  with young, single doctors.&nbsp; Did I mention that a goodly number of the doctors there were old and/or married?&nbsp; In fact, I believe they all were.&nbsp; There was one really young internist (female) who was there.&nbsp; Totally nice!&nbsp; I'd like to be friends with her.&nbsp; Oh well, who knows if I'll&nbsp; even&nbsp; see her again   &nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;              So I went home early (I say&nbsp;early sarcastically, I got to work at 6:30 am, and&nbsp;got home at 7:15 pm, but at least I didn't have to stay for the cleanup until 8), snuggled&nbsp;the&nbsp;muttpuppy, and watched Things I&nbsp;Hate About You on Bravo.                 &nbsp;        I have decided&nbsp;I do NOT like that show.&nbsp; It could have been that I didn't like the people,&nbsp;or that it makes me&nbsp;not want to ever live with a boy because the ones they've&nbsp;had on the show have been yucky... Mind you I don't have brothers,&nbsp;so I've NEVER had that sort of experience.&nbsp; If it turns out that all boys are not yucky like that, let me know, and I'll happily believe you. &nbsp;  &nbsp;        &nbsp;

            It's a Monday morning and I'm stretching My imagination to write this song This is what I'd rather do Why else would I stay at home All morning long       And I don't wanna go to work I never do And all those other people in the news Who are out of work Can trade places with me Cause when you found that you Have something better to do With your life I guarantee You'd feel the same way too       My friend and I we spent the weekend Running from responsibilities Just like kids we played with crayons Drawing pictures of our families       I was supposed to be somewhere else I didn't show Oh there I go And all I wanted was to go So far away Where no one knows my name And no one will ever ask Why I ran away And where I'm going and how And where I want to be Five years or so from now       But just for once I'd like to do What I feel is right All because that's how I feel And with some practice and some time To follow my heart Would be no big deal       Oh it's been too many years Of chasing after a career And in my bitter tears I call on my soul and hear This number has been disconnected For years       It's a Monday morning and I'm stretching My imagination to write this song Oh maybe it's the stretch That I've been needing my whole life long       And I don't wanna go to work I never do But I'll go anyway Today tomorrow too Although I know that I have Better things to do I'll use this morning As a step to take me to       Another morning someday When I will be whole And I won't hesitate at the door Of my own soul And when people ask Why don't you just grow up I'll say I tried that And I had more than enough       And when I'm calling on my soul I'll hear my own voice say Yeah, I'm home Would ya like to come over and play       It's a Monday morning and I'm stretching My imagination to write this song       All songs copyright © Little Blue Dot Music (BMI) except where noted.

      I caught up on sleep.  I chased off a migraine that I got from oversleeping by taking migraine medicine and sleeping it off.  I cleaned my living room and kitchen.  I paid most of my bills.  I am currently uploading more pix from the Copper Circus Arts show I went to a month ago, and am more than 2/3 done.&nbsp; This has taken FOREVER because of big files, slow dial-up, and I'm still too afraid to try it at work.  I put gas in the car.  I brushed the dog, and helped him shed enough hair to make a second dog.&nbsp; About cocker spaniel sized.  I played with a real cocker spaniel at my aunt's house.  That's all I did today.  Yesterday when I got to work there was the most unusual message I've ever received waiting for me: "Heather, can you please Ben?&nbsp; Thx, V"&nbsp; So, I found Vicki and asked what the heck did Ben say to her to leave me that message, and isn't that a weird one to leave with another person?&nbsp; She forgot the verb "call" thus making "please" the verb.&nbsp; I'm still undecided if I should share this with Ben.&nbsp; I called him, though, and he was going on a run and wanted to know if he should get me anything.&nbsp; I said yes.&nbsp; I'm uncertain if my "yes" pleased him.&nbsp; But my ego makes me assume it did.

          I've got  "Daysleeper" by REM in my head... one of my favorites of theirs.&nbsp; Other  songs I like are "Half A World Away" "Bad Day" "At My Most Beautiful" "You Are  the Everything" "It's the End of the World..." "Perfect Circle" "Try Not to  Breathe" "Hairshirt" "Fall on Me" and "Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite."&nbsp; That's  not all, but those are all that come to mind at this second...&nbsp; "I am not  the type of dog to leave you hanging for no good reason..."         &nbsp;     That's from  "Hairshirt."&nbsp; Other hairshirty referencing songs I like are "What a Good  Boy" by Barenaked Ladies... and that's the only other hairshirt song I can think  of.&nbsp; Song lines I like by BNL are "If you question what I would do to get  over and be with you, lift you up over everything to light up my room."&nbsp;  Even though that's a dependent clause and no condition follows it.&nbsp; The  first time my old roommate Mina heard that song, (it references radio stations  that conduct through their teeth, being able to light a bulb by holding it in  their hands, etc... sounds WEIRD but it's a really pretty song), she said "What  is going on?&nbsp; Are these people made of metal?" and was terribly  confused.&nbsp; I really like "When I Fall" by BNL too.&nbsp; I'm not going to  do this mental drivel online anymore.         &nbsp;     I should start  workin'.

                                    So, I wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for an Americano this morning, but I got one anyway.        &nbsp;        And the cream I put in it was rancid.        &nbsp;        So I&#8217;ve got a Mtn. Dew instead.        &nbsp;        I&#8217;ve got to plan a BIG party (black-tie dinner for 200), and it&#8217;s really fun.&nbsp;         &nbsp;        I&#8217;ve also got less fun things to do.        &nbsp;        Fred, thanks for playing along.&nbsp; You helped with one of the less fun things.

          I'm not going to be  homeless at least for the next two weeks because...         &nbsp;     I get to work at the  hospital for 2 more weeks... yay!         &nbsp;     That means I get  paid for two more weeks!&nbsp; yay!         &nbsp;     I have the Popeye  theme song running around my brain.

         Hey party people!       &nbsp;   I have had a crazy week.&nbsp; There were a few moments this afternoon I thought I would go over the deep end!&nbsp; It's just busy.&nbsp; There's a chance that I'll be working for at least a month, definitely the last week of July, and I've had 2 other job offers from working this job.&nbsp; So all depends on me right now.&nbsp; I have to decide if I'll take out more loans and work less, or take out less loans and work more.&nbsp; Both have definite pros and cons...&nbsp; Argh.       &nbsp;   But at work they'be taught me to play games with text pagers.&nbsp; And usually the games involve making musical references to the 70s and 80s.&nbsp; So I'm having a blast.&nbsp; I.e., please call Jenny at 867-5309.&nbsp; Or Rio called re: dancing on the sand.&nbsp;I tried texting 99 Luftballoons, but the German characters aren't supported.&nbsp; And the trick is knowing the people to play this game with.&nbsp; I have 2 such game buddies.&nbsp; We also send random pictures via email that waste space but are really funny...&nbsp; Surprisingly, I get tons of work done, too.&nbsp; I'm one of those all work and no play makes Heather nutso people.       &nbsp;   Speaking of less than sane, I just WAS NOT IN THE MOOD FOR COFFEE today.&nbsp; I almost wandered in and got my iced americano, and decided I didn't want one.&nbsp; I had a mtn. dew instead.&nbsp; What is this world coming to!?       &nbsp;   I been digging on old Ani Difranco albums lately... Especially Out of Range.&nbsp; It's a good one.       &nbsp;   Did you know July is National Ice Cream Month?&nbsp; Hell, I thought EVERY month was just that.       &nbsp;   But it's payday!

         So, it turns out that when I faxed my timecard on Friday night, it didn't go through to the office, and I didn't find that out until Monday at 9:30.&nbsp; I hope I get paid this week or I may cry.       &nbsp;   It's been a funny week so far.&nbsp; I truly have very little awareness of what day it is.&nbsp; Let me reckon it out... I think it's Tuesday.&nbsp; Last night I had to go to Petco to buy more dog food (see previous post), but I had to go to another city.&nbsp; Because there isn't even one Petco in the city of Denver.&nbsp; I was so annoyed, I didn't really know where the store was (other than Sheridan and 88th Ave), and I drove around that area for almost an hour before I grew a brain, called 411, called them and asked where they were.&nbsp; In the meantime, I'd made myself carsick and sort of started growing a migraine.&nbsp; In my annoyance (mostly with myself for not paying closer attention when I was looking at the store location online) I swore more creatively than I'd have though possible.&nbsp; I suggested the City of Westminster do things to itself that are anatomically impossible.&nbsp; It was nearly art.       &nbsp;   But I missed the first 30 minutes of I love the 90's 1990, but saw all of 1991.&nbsp; It was fun... Hal Sparks is fun.&nbsp; I even like Michael Ian Black on this show.       &nbsp;   And I have been obsessed with Bravo in general.&nbsp; At my house in CA, I didn't get Bravo, so I'm newly into Queer Eye...&nbsp; I also love Blow Out (I actually love to hate Blow Out), and have become fascinated with Celebrity Poker Showdown...&nbsp; I even understand Poker... finally.&nbsp; I'm still a tiny bit fuzzy on the betting, but by and large I understnad what's going down.       &nbsp;   Okay, thus ends my TV ramble... Except to say there here, its' really nice that Whose Line on the Family Channel is on at 8 instead of 10, so I can stay up late enough to watch it!       &nbsp;   Jill told me the next season of Alias wasn't starting until January... After the last season (which sorta blew except for a few shining moments: "I was in a tangent once."&nbsp; "How nice for you"), I'm okay with that.&nbsp; JJ Abrams is all busy with The Lost, I suppose.       &nbsp;   Okay, that really ends my TV ramble.

          So, it's pretty  toasty already today, and on top of that, it's a bit humid.&nbsp; so I'm sweaty  and I KNOW this will be a day when my deodorant gives out before I make it  home.         &nbsp;     And I'm such a bad  mom... Ernie's completely out of dog food.&nbsp; I fed him a peanut butter  sandwich for breakfast.&nbsp; I feel so  badly...

      So I've decided that for you to actually SEE the pictures I took at Copper Circus Arts a few weeks ago, it would help to actually POST the link.   urlLink photos.yahoo.com/swandive00   I've posted about 12 more today and there are around 95 in toto.  So come back every now and then to see what else there is to see.  If you're wondering, the guy in the striped shirt is named Sven.

      Yes, I can post via email.  Perhaps I'll do just that from time to time.  Annie, with regard to the necessity of I'm off like a prom dress, no it wasn't.  In fact I didn't even remember having thought of whether I should do that, and didn't remember doing it until you pointed it out.  Next time I'll be off like a dirty shirt.  Or something.  I got my hair cut and my highlights touched up yesterday.  I also went shopping because I'm sick to death of wearing the same 5 things to work.  I've been there almost 4 weeks, and there's the possibility I'll be there 4 weeks or longer, so I had to buy some grown up work clothes.  I'm so used to having a job where I can wear khakis and sit on the floor, and read kiddie books that this is a bit bizarre for me.  Today my Colorado family and I went up to Georgetown, a little mining town cum tourist trap in the rockies.  I'd been there for a train ride and a picnic one summer many years ago, and all I could remember was a very vague train ride and being devoured by mosquitos at the picnic.  Today it was nice.  We strolled along shops with nothing interesting (touristy stuff like t-shirts and Navajo jewelry and ridiculously priced boutiques and Scandinavian shops), had lunch and then sat in the absurd coming-down-the-mountain-rush-hour traffic.  I'm not a huge camping person, but I would tend to think that escaping into the mountains for the weekend and then sitting in traffic driving down a mountain would undo some of the stress release that said escape grants.  Earlier in the day I started reading The Mammoth Cheese sitting out in the sun hoping to get a little color on my shoulders and chest (I was wearing a strappy tank top, let's don't get too carried away)  When there is a procession of people, they do not process down an aisle or whatever.  Process (accent on the second syllable) isn't a good enough word. Process (accent on 1st syllable) is a good word, but it doesn't mean the same thing.  People proceed down an aisle.  Just like when people exhibit they are under distress, they aren't distressed, they're distraught.  Random venting.  I'm going to the Denver Zoo next weekend for the Exempla Healthcare picnic with my aunt.  It will be okay because I know some people there now.  However, I never like zoos.  They just about invariably make me sad, especially ones that don't have the greatest funding in the world and it shows.  However, San Diego Wild Animal Park and Sea World tend not to make me too sad, and this is supposed to be a faboo zoo, with 2 newborn gorillas, so we'll see.  I'll report later.  I'm so excited about I Love the 90's starting this week.  I love looking at the 70's and 80's through the eyes of pop culture.  I really enjoyed I Love the 80's mroe than the 70's because I remember so much more of the 80's.  But I remember even more of the 90's so it should be totally amusing... I saw the bit they did on Groove is in the Heart, and it brought me back to 7th and 8th grade when that song was it (particularly Fred's choreography, and Anna... Anna Whatshername...  Do you remmeber Fred?  The one who lived near you whose mother was deaf?  The first person to tell me I was so full of shit that even my eyes were brown).  Yes, I still have that CD...  "ESP 3-D Stylie... I'd walk a miley for your smiley 'cause it's really recommended quite highly..."  I'm going to make like a tree and get outta here.

      2 of my posts aren't showing up.  But my Dashboard says they're there.  Anyhow, since after posting about losing 2 of my favorite DVDs, I found them (and one other that I didn't realize I was missing), I'm going to post that I can't find my copy of A Prayer for Owen Meany, which I'm really in the mood to read right now.  So I'm making do with Here Be Dragons.  I saw Cirque du Solieil yesterday.  It reminds me of all the things I loved about being in the circus, and makes me forget that I wasn't so good at it.  Realistically, the thing that I'd be best at are the contortion types of things.  Anyhow, I liked Varekai MUCH better than the last show I saw which was Alegria (in Biloxi MS, with an ex-boyfriend, right after the father of the quadreplegic man of whom I was taking care died, so it may have been situational).  However, Alegria is the only one that ever made me cry.  (again, may have been situational)  But the aerialists were amazing, the juggler was good (although he had a bit of an off-night), and the Russian Swing was amazing (they had a bit of an off-night too, which is a heck of a lot scarier than the juggler having an off-night).  I've found myself sort of jaded with circuses, so the fact that the Russian Swing act had me holding my breath says a bit of a lot.  It also reminded me of the Ani song "Freakshow" where she says "We live to hear the slack jaw gasping, we live under a halo of held breath, and when the children raise up a giant shield of laughter it's like the pending of death."   I'm working on my tan after I get offline.  It's time.  Remember last summer when I had all kinds of time to work on it by the pool?  Yeah, that was nice...  I had a migraine for most of Sat. and Sun. and even after 7 Midrin, 3 Maxalt, 6 Aleve, and 8 Mountain Dews, it didn't really ever go away until this morning.  So I'm feeling washed out right now.  And I'm posting more pictures on my yahoo site.  Okay, bye.

      So I got me some pictures up on my yahoo account.  Do you want to see them? They're from the  urlLink Copper Mountain Circus Arts  show.  There's only about 30 up right now, and I have around 100 that I'll be posting, so keep checking back.  The juggler, Sven, although there aren't many pictures of him juggling, is one of the most bautiful jugglers I've ever seen.  And he picks good music.  And, Cris, you can tell him I said that.  Anhyhow, here's where they are:   urlLink    Just be a nice monkey and use them for viewing and don't steal the photo credit, you stinker.  I will crush your head if you do.  I go through phases where I dig the pop stations.  Right now I like that "Sexy" song by Beyonce.  not enough to actually know the name, but I tend to keep it on that station when it plays.  And that Usher song that's sampled all over the place right now.. Not "Burn" or "Confessions" but the other one.  I just don't like Ludacris' rap in that because it skeeves me out.  Random thought.

      So, technically, it's Saturday afternoon, but whatever. I have a three day weekend I have a migraine I'm going to see Cirque du Soleil tomorrow afternoon I got tickets for $27.50 with no surcharges I paid my rent on Thursday I got my secon paycheck that same day I don't think I want to work full time when I'm going to school Because I'll also have to take some undergrad level classes which tend to run for a shoter period over more days then graduate level classes I think for another language class (I have to be proficient in at least 1 other than English, my French is passable enough that I'd rather not take more French classes)  I may take Russian. There is no specific word order in Russian grammar I can already say "circus," "elephant," and "right hand" in Russian I can phonetically spell "snar" in Russian My next Starbucks drink at Safeway is free Dammit, I forgot to bring my laundry to my aunt's house...maybe on Monday I took a 3 hour Bendadryl-induced nap today I've been playing a few old Suzanne Vega songs (i.e. Small Blue Thing and Gypsy and The Queen and the Soldier) on guitar lately. I'm obsessed with the Nick Drake song "..." wait, I've forgotten the title... It's something about Behind the Sun, track 6 on Pink Moon I think I'll go hunt up the tabs for that I'm wearing sunglasses in the house because the light is hurting my head I'm off like a prom dress.

       I   had bizarro dreams last night involving the power rangers, brownies, and senior living apartments.  And an elementary school, too.  It was really weird.        But now I really want a brownie from my mom's kitchen or Rocky Mtn. Chocolate Factory.      I bought a computer this weekend...  I was going to get an iBook, but at the last minute I decided that it might just be too much of a pain in the tookus to try and take things that I'm working on at work and school and try to figure out how to make it all work.  So I got a Dell 600m.  I will hopefully have it in a few weeks.   Spending that much money sent me into a case of the vapors.

          ...and boy does it hurt!&nbsp; Sorry, my friend Alan used to say that all  the time.&nbsp; I actually have Talking Heads in my head (that sounds like a job  for a shrink...).&nbsp; The SNL skit that parodied that "letting the days go by"  where David Byrne says, "and you may ask yourself, why such a big suit?"&nbsp;  It's really funny.         &nbsp;     Anyhow, I'm busy in a good way today, not about to be buried in work, but  doing a lot of things, keeping me off crack and off the  streets.         &nbsp;     I have an insured parcel at the post office... I don't know who it's  from, but oooh... how exciting!&nbsp; I'm hoping it's a CD I ordered, but we'll  see I suppose.&nbsp;          &nbsp;     I was up until 1:30 this morning.... bad news when you're waking up at  5.&nbsp; But I feel mostly okay, as long as I don't think about it.&nbsp; I  spent a goodly part of the weekend fighting off a sinus infection, so the  sudafed and the excedrin gave me the jitters, making it difficult to  sleep.&nbsp; But I won.&nbsp; My sinuses feel fresh as a daisy, thank you.&nbsp;  I set a new Heather Sneeze Record yesterday: 18 consecutive sneezes!&nbsp; It  was ready for a nap when I was done....&nbsp; Okay, back to work I go.&nbsp;
