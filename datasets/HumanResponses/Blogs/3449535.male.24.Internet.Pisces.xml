       How I decided to go in Ireland ? Destiny has choosen for me. I have met Anne-Lise, back to France for few days and living in Dublin since 2 years. We have strated a great relationship together, for shure ... She said that the place where she's living was great, that's true ! and I encourage people to go overthere! It's so amazing, a total different way of thinking. You have to see to know...    It was my first time in Ireland. Basicly, I decided to go in Ireland to visit my girlfriend Anne-Lise in Dublin. The trip was a bit short (10 days) to visit everythings in Ireland but certainly one of my favourite trip. It represents a kind of a big turn in my life... This Trip was the best way for me to open my mind, to meet some intressing people, some strange people, some "different ways of thinking" and all the real "elements". Ok... If you want some names ... Guiness, Green stuff, lambs, stones, huge landscapes, outside front of the pubs' amiances, helpfull people, bed and breakfast, grass, weather (I know, pretty strange but I love the weater, not so hot, not so cold, strange and attractive luminosity ).

       Friday evening, 25th of June 2004, French team is playing against Greek team. One of the worst game of euro 04. They has loosed easily... French are just out ! Anyway ....  Friday 25th > 10 p.m. > The evening should start yet ! Let's focalize our direction to "Neuve-Eglise" (near Selestat) and let's go for THE Week end for Music and Beer lovers. It is called "Decibulles" Deci="Deciliters" Bulles="Bubbles" let's guess what does it mean ;-) answer : Lot's of quantity of beer ---> lot's of bubbles directly in your head ...   You should add high quality muisicians like   Horace Andy  and  Sergent Garcia . They made the FIRE through the Festival... Definitively !  Horace Andy  has played good and old school reggae music, a kind of rocksteady generating millions of good vibrations. Pretty good vibes, ambiance safe and relax, talking people, drunken people, rastaman smokers. Every different "clich√©" from Reggae concerts has been represented. Smells Marijuana and good beers everywhere. Everybody was drunk, stoned but smiles were always there on each faces. It's good to see that, people are waked up, alive, smiling, and absolutely not scared about the tomorrow. They have simply enjoyed the moment. What a life lesson !    The place was still crowded. The next bands succeeded on stages but wasn't so exciting ... We have enjoyed that moment to drink tones of Guiness, smoke joints, laughing, meet our friends, and waited the next Exciting group called "Sergent Garcia". The "official" time planing was in late. 1 hour late. People started to be tired. We needed some enegy and good vibrations.    Sergent Garcia and musicians  jumped on stage. The warm up has started... Cuban Percussions, salsa vibes, and lyrics fast and furious. May be the comparaison is hard to do but a kind of "Mano Negra" spirit was flying over our heads... Seriously ! The energy was so easy to feel, you know this sort of sensation you cannot explain ... All the good vibes accumulation from the week end, second state in your head, just feeling so gooood ..    To summarize, This festival was brilliant ! The camping was confortable, people was really friendly, percussions, guitarist players, singers, was everywhere. All that stuff under sunshining rays. What a perfect view of life. The modernist hyppies from 2000's. A woodstock festival in  small dimensions. So intressting ...
