						   Well, I was supposed to leave for Florida today and then yesterday they had to take my grandmother to the hospital...today they decided to check and see if it was a heart attack and in the middle of all the tests she had another one and then they decided to do open heart surgery and in the midst of that she had yet another heat attack. So i think its fair to say things aren't lookin good...I doubt i will ge to go on vacation at all and my grandmother doesn't have very good odds of living through the week...Well im gonna go ttyl...~Courtney~

She did say it would feel like someone has punched me really really hard in the arm for a few days though...what sucks though becuase it just so happens i got it in the exact same spot lindsey punched me in a couple of weeks ago and the bruise just went away a couple of days ago!! :) Oh well!!
