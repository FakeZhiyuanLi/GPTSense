       So quiet   Another wasted night    The television steals the conversation    Exhale    Another wasted breath    Again it goes unnoticed     &nbsp;   Please tell me you're just feeling tired    'cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break    Out of touch out of time    Please send me anything but signals that are mixed    'cause I can't read your rolling eyes    Out of touch are we out of time     &nbsp;   Close lipped    Another goodnight kiss    Is robbed of all its passion    Your grip    Another time is slack    It leaves me feeling empty     &nbsp;   Please tell me you're just feeling tired    'cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break    Out of touch out of time    Please send me anything but signals that are mixed    'cause I can't&nbsp;read your rolling eyes    Out of touch are we out of time     &nbsp;   I'll wait until tomorrow    Maybe you'll feel better then    Maybe we'll be better then    So what's another day    When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you    This mood of yours is temporary    It seems worth the wait    To see you smile again    Out of the corner of your eye    Won’t be the only way you're looking at me then     &nbsp;   So quiet    Another wasted night    The television steals the conversation    Exhale    Another wasted breath    Again it goes unnoticed

      sometimes just wish i could kill myself & not hurt anyone else or make them worry... i will never ever forgive myself for what i did... im really very sorry that i stood you up... don really know myself anymore... that wasn't da frist time i stood you up... my life is sinking, you're worring &amp; hoping... my mind is hidding in da shadows of my head... digging for da time... i cried, cried wonderin if your fine, wondering was i there to comfort you...   'one life avant la fin'  ... im doing my best to not make you worry but everytime im close i fall back down fast... my mind is killing me slowly, my body has become weaker day by day... don wanna lose those i hold dear... hold me tight so i can rest in your arms & find peace with myself...&nbsp;happiness in you&nbsp;is&nbsp;da only way my worries are calm... '  love you always my dear'

      (Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember  I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,  The dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers  And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late  And this walk that we shared together  The streets were wet and the gate was locked  So I jumped it, and let you in  And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist  And you kissed me like you meant it  And I knew that you meant itThat you meant it, that you meant it  And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it.)  .....that was what happen during my day with my galfren(im flyin wifout my wings)  i love u « ¤ ñÜ®Å ¤ »™
