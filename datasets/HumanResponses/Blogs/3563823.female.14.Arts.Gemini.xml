      Errm..Well..wat i think bout guys is simple:they are biased towards gurls,they never give in to gurls,they are so cruel to gurls,they always look down on gurls,they never trust gurls..BUT we gurls cannot live without them..Why?No One knows the answer..maybe bcoz guys are more matured than gurls..who knows..how to get the guy of ur choice?its simple..just follow my steps..when every guy wants to be with u,be with them..within a week,if u can go on with them,then go on.If not,then split up..When the guys doesn't want a break up,then timed them..its simple as that..LoLx..don follow wat i just said or u will never able to find ur dream guy..follow wat ur heart wants.dont follow wat others says..ur choice in is ur hands.no one can decide ur choice unless u decide urself..BUT its up to the parents to restu the relationship..when they dont let u get on with ur guy,cabot rumah lah..LoLx..never do that..parents are more important than ur guy..always remember wat ur parents had sacrificed for u..GuyS are sumtimes needed to cool us down..so watever ur choice is,make it a grant..GOOD LuCK!!
