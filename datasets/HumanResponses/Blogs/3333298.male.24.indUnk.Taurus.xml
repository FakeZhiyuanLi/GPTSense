      With all this talk of Roland Emmerich's movie floating around, I thought I'd point out a more interesting science fictional resource on the matter of global warming.  David Brin's novel  urlLink    Earth   portrays a world in the not-too-distant-future where a great deal has changed.  The novel has its own weird excesses toward the end, but seems to do better at getting the science of global warmning (and in tracking its effect on global society) right.  There is a lot here, though, including the aftermath of a war against Switzerland to create a transparent society (that is, a society with no privacy, which Brin discusses in a social sciences context in  urlLink    The Transparent Society  ), and a small black hole that slipped into the center of the Earth, which gives this novel its own disaster movie flare.  It's representative of some of the best hard science fiction around, melding hard science with a nuanced view of social relationships and how they might disintegrate in the face of impending doom.  Of course, the politics of Brin's book are too complicated, and too real, for Gore and Emmerich to deal with.  They'll take the easy way out.  I also saw, in the bookstore today, a new novel my Kim Stanley Robinson (whose  urlLink  Mars books  grapple with the equally thorny issue of Martian terraformation) called  urlLink    Forty Signs of Rain   which seeks to cover the political terrain of the issue as it unfolds.  Robinson is good with both politics and science, so I think it's a good bet.

      And why am I defending   The Day After Tomorrow  from  urlLink  Tim's attacks?   Well, first of all, I'm really not.  The science is obviously seriously f'ed up and unbelievable.  The 10 degrees per second incident is retarded.  No one would survive that, burned Nietzsche text or no.  It was already way under zero degrees Farenheit, so by the time this little storm passed it would be, I don't know, absolute zero or something.  However, Tim, by the time they were standing hatless on the rooftop, the storm had ended.  The supercold air, which was sucked from the troposphere down by the funnel of the glacier-hurricane, would have dissipated quite quickly once the sunlight returned.  So, although they should have all been frozen instantaneously like those dudes in Scotland, that's beside the point.  If they miraculously survived, they could probably be around sans hat at the end, with minimal frostbite.  Tim does not mention the wolf fight, which is definitely the dumbest part of this movie.  Wolves and dorks alike would have been too frozen to do much fighting at this point.  Plus, CGI wolves aren't very scary to me.  The frickin' air was scarier, in fact.  How can it be that two people can agree, almost point for point, on the nature of a film and still disagree on whether or not it's good?  Tim and I obviously feel differently about this movie without really disagreeing about anything.  Well, the answer is emphasis.  I simply don't care how ridiculous it all is, while Tim apparently does.  And I refuse to take the director's politics seriously, since that's exactly what he wants us to do.  I've spent enough time ignoring Susan Sarandon whenever she opens her mouth to know that it's best to pretend celebrities have no politics, and just enjoy the show.

       urlLink  Ben asked if I like Cronenberg's   Naked Lunch .   The answer is a sort of tentative yes.  I haven't seen the movie since I was in high school, and my memory isn't that clear on it.  I recall responded to elements of it quite well, but not being able to fully submerge myself in the world.  That's a big problem for a Cronie movie, as his work is usually so well done as to be believable. (even when there are  urlLink  VCR vaginas galore .)  I was also very young and naive, and it's possible that with a better understanding of Cronie I might like it more.  Or I might like it less.  I do know that William S. Burroughs is a terrible writer and that even contemplating turning such difficult, intentionally inacessible and mindless a novel as   Naked Lunch  into a film is a study in masochism.  I can see what Cronie would want to do the project, though, and can see the link in terms of aesthetics between the two artists.  But Cronenberg is way too good for Burroughs.  If I watch this again, any time soon, I will fashion a more detailed response.  In the mean time, just know that I feel your pain, Ben, even if I do think I liked the movie.  However --   M. Butterfly  is fucking awesome and I am disappointed that you stalled 20 minutes in.  Boo hiss.

      My friend Jesse, came up this weekend and we wanted to go to a theater-pub and drink some beer and watch a movie.  Unfortunately, there weren't many exciting movie options at said pubs.  So we settled for   Monster , which neither of us had seen, but both at least were interested in.  Paying three dollars for a movie, and getting to numb your way through it with Pabst really makes anything watchable, I think.  This movie was okay.  It was even "good" if you want to stretch that word's meaning far beyond its normal definition.  I was never bored by it, it was paced well and not overly long.  It had some great shots, which were even greater since they jumped out at you from the otherwise drab cinematography.  It had two great performances, from Charlize Theron, who did less well than many seemed to think, but who was definitely on a par with most of her fellow Academy Award alumni, and Christina Ricci, who provided some of the most complicated emotional/psychological work in the movie and who hasn't been given enough credit.  In fact, without Ricci's big-eyed pseudo-naif act the movie likely wouldn't have worked.  The best scenes were easily the ones where the two actresses were together; their lust, their manipulations, their awkwardness feed on each other to produce remarkable results.  So much of the rest of the movie was unhinged and methodical.  And far too much time was spent trying to make the serial killer sympathetic.  Serial killers are not sympathetic people, no matter how much they went through before going on their killing sprees.  No amount of cliched feminist grandstanding can make me really think this woman shouldn't have been executed.  One of the most profound sentiments in the film is uttered by the Ricci's characters aunt, who is portrayed as a racist Southern idiot, who says "Lots of us had bad lives.  But we can't all just be hookers and druggies because our mom was mean to us!"  The filmmaker wants us to take that statement as more proof that these people just don't "get" Aileen Wuornos.  But we do get her, we just aren't willing to let her terrible life make it okay for her to murder innocent men.  This movie, a bit like   The Day After Tomorrow , spends too much time trying to fashion a political statement where there isn't one to be found.  I suppose this could have become an anti-death penalty film, but the message given is that she shouldn't have been put to death because she had been raped by the first guy she killed.  That isn't an argument against capital punishment, it's an argument for mitigating circumstances.  We can't get a real look into this woman's soul, or what drives her, because of the hurdles thrown in our way.  And worst of all, the movie doesn't even deliver the serial killer goods.  We see a few murders (four the seven she committed), which are portrayed with a kind of detached ferocity that is respectable, but not virtuoso.  If I am going to have to watch a serial killer movie, I at least want to see a lot of murdering.  This film would have been greatly perfected if director Patty Jenkins had followed my formula: "Less weeping, more murdering."  Sometimes a movie is bad, but has a great performance or two that make it worth your time (the recent Plath biopic,   Sylvia  is an example).  And sometimes even a great performance is so utterly wasted on a poor script that it becomes meaningless.  Ricci was brilliant and memorable, but as good as Charlize Theron was, and she was very good, I won't remember her performance at all once she's handed the golden statue off to the next in the line of Hollywood actresses to win it next spring.  I will forget the rest of the movie much sooner.

      I saw   The Day After Tomorrow  on opening night.  Basically every review I've read says the same thing.  "The effects are cool but the story is bad."  Therefore, I suppose, all the reviews were bad.  This is because critics have this bias towards "story" and "character development" and "plots" that let us "suspend disbelief."  This is all well and good, I suppose.  Except that it misses the point of a movie like this.  Yes, the story is terrible.  Not only is it implausible, but it's sentimental and predictable.  When you can predict every implausible twist, you know something's wrong.  The film's politics are even lamer.  Everything is simplified into an "I-told-you-so" dialectic that doesn't even brush the surface of the real global warming debate.  Conservative viewpoints are reduced haphazardly, of course, without any kind of context.  This is the kind of movie designed to make conservatives look stupid, but which ends up making liberals look even worse.  Okay, so there are also no good performances really, either.  Except for Cheney's stand-in, who delivers his lines with a cold arrogance that is magnificent to behold.  All of these things could have been changed to make a great movie.  But they weren't, and it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter, because this movie is still a ton of fun to watch.  As ridiculous as it all is, who cares?  Watching tornadoes destroy Los Angeles, and a wave crest   over   the Statue of Liberty, and glaciers march steadily over the northern United States is beautiful to behold.  Pure, wholesale, mass destruction is one of the greatest pleasures to be found on film.  All that plot nonsense is just an attempt to hang the effects around something (and maybe to make a trite message while we're at it.)  The effects here are big and nasty and fun, even the most ridiculous of them (including the instantaneous formation of a glacier covering Manhattan, or the cold air chasing Jake Gyllenhaal (suddenly we're in a monster movie!  Run from the air, Jake, run!)  Even the worst of a dialogue, and the grossest emotional manipulations only emphasize the mayhem being wreaked all around us.  And trust me, there is a lot of manipulation here.  There are scenes designed to make us cheer or laugh, like Americans fleeing into Mexico illegally; there are scenes designed to make us cry, like Sela Ward reading   Peter Pan  to a boy dying of cancer, unsure if either of them will survive the storm.  There is also a scene that is the intellectual's equivalent of the doctor-at-patient's-bedside manipulation.  A tight-assed, dorky man, trapped in the library and forced to burn books to stay alive, clutches a Gutenberg Bible to his chest to protect it from the fire, saying: "If all of Western Civilization is to be wiped out, I will save at least one part of it."  I will admit I'm overly susceptible to such manipulations, and this scene brought a tear to my eye.  A man willing to die with a book in his arms is a man after my own heart.  This movie's worst problem, of course, is the shenanigans of the director and cast, and Al Gore, running around using it as a "message tool."  It doesn't work, because the science is so bad, and distorted to fit neatly into the action movie formula, that it's laughable to treat it seriously.  Global warming is a serious danger to our world, but it won't happen in any three days.  It will wreak massive global change, but it will not destroy Western Civilization.  This movie has no real chance of exciting conversation on the topic of global warming, and gives more ammunition to the doubters, who can say that those of us concerned about the issue are playing Chicken Little.  The filmmaker clearly hopes this movie can become the environmentalist's   Passion of the Christ .  But   The Passion of An Implausible Glacier  doesn't have the same ring to it.  So forget the politics around the issue.  Forget all those lies you've been told about the necessity of plot and characters and emotional resonance, and go watch the weather fuck shit up.  Eat some popcorn, enjoy a little global destruction, and have a little fun.  It's   summer  after all.  Save the emotional resonance for November.

      I'm sorry guys, I know that you are all probably tired of my fixation on Ms. Coulter.  You are probably also tired of reading about  The Passion of the Christ .  But I found two really great pieces by Ann about the movie that are worth a look.  You can find them  urlLink  here  and  urlLink  here .  I think she ultimately misses the point, which is that however good a religion by be, it's gun-toting practitioners rarely seem to get that message.  These two passages made me pee my pants (kind of):    With all the subtlety of a Mack truck, Safire called Gibson's movie a version of "the medieval 'passion play,' preserved in pre-Hitler Germany at Oberammergau, a source of the hatred of all Jews as 'Christ killers.'"  (Certainly every Aryan Nation skinhead murderer I've ever met was also a devoted theater buff and "passion play" aficionado.)   The "passion play" has been put on in Germany since at least 1633. I guess 1633 would be "pre-Hitler." In addition, Moses walked the Earth "pre-Hitler." The wheel was invented "pre-Hitler." People ate soup "pre-Hitler." Referring to the passion play as "pre-Hitler" is a slightly fancier version of every adolescent's favorite argument: You're like Hitler!    and:   In fact, Jesus' distinctive message was:   People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.  That is the reason   He is called "Christ the Redeemer" rather than "Christ the Moron Driving Around in a Volvo With a 'Be Nice to People' Bumper Sticker on It."

      I won't bother to make a counterargument to Ann Coulter's  urlLink  slightly overblown attack on Arlen Specter .  It will surprise no one that I, a Democrat, support one of the most interesting moderate Republicans in the Senate.  (though calling Specter a "moderate" is misleading' his views, like those of most "moderates" aren't so much in the middle of the Left-Right spectrum as outside of it altogether, something that Ann Coulter and Michael Moore can agree to hating.)  Nor will it surprise anyone that I think it's a good thing that a reactionary zealot like Robert Bork is not on the Court (and thank Senators Kennedy and Specter every time the conservative Rehnquist Court hands down a decent decision).  I will even praise her comments in the column on gun control.  If a woman has a right to have an abortion after she is raped, why shouldn't she have the right to carry a weapon to stop the rape altogether?  The point of this is just that I want to share with you another great Coulter quote, in which she recklessly and snarkily both compares gay marriage to penis enlargement and implies that Senator Specter has a small dick:   Luckily for the country, Clarence Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court a year before Specter was up for re-election. After supporting Thomas, Specter turned around and started bellyaching that Thomas was a "disappointment" – presumably for Thomas' failure to ferret out any more "new" constitutional rights such as gay marriage or taxpayer-subsidized penis augmentation. Don't hope for any more election-year conversions if Specter is re-elected: The old coot will be 80 years old by the end of the term.

      The President must really miss good old Ari.  Scott McClellan is  urlLink  way too easily badgered into submission by the White House Press Corps .  And, worse yet, he has a tendency to reveal portions of Bush's plan for America that I'm sure are meant to be kept secret.  The fact that this transcript (which I cribbed from  urlLink  Tim ) is the first to include the remarks which come before McClellan tries to claim that members of the Bush campaign staff, who happen to be his drink-crazy daughters, are off-limits to questions (and Ms. Thomas makes him her bitch), might make it indicative of an even wider conspiracy.  (Please note: I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist myself, and think that probably McClellan is just a terrible press flack who needs to watch more of the West Wing for pointers from CJ Cregg, still it's creepy as fuck):   WND: Of course. But he would never allow the FCC to take action against any of us in talk radio for our political opinions, would he?   McCLELLAN: In a general sense, no. But, again, you phrase that in a context of some standards that apparently violated some of the Â our standards of decency.   So, the President will respect the First Amendment in a "general sense?"  He won't let the FCC drive his political opponents off the air in a "general sense"?  Of course, Bush is not alone here.  A while ago I remarked on a Salon article in which the author clearly compared Limbaugh's political views to Stern's obscenity (and advocated Limbaugh's removal from Armed Forces Radio as a result.)  The First Amendment is the one that both liberals and conservatives choose to treat in a "general sense" in the process of advancing their causes, and the one that is most vital to sustained democracy.  If there is any amendment that should not be treated "generally" it is Amendment I.  Of course, earlier in the transcript the reporter makes it clear that he, at least, isn't all that troubled by the persecution of Howard Stern, only by its implications for the political press.  This is a bit troubling too, although before anyone gets their panties in a twist, it's important that our legal system does make a strong distinction between political speech (which is always protected, however despicable) and non-political speech (which is, I suppose, "generally" protected, but with reasonable restrictions).  The real problem comes when the "obscene" and the "political" merge -- Stern can be political, although mostly he's just another asshole who thinks he's funny.  Can the obscenity rule be used to drive off political voices?  Obviously it can, and it's important to watch out for obscene right-wingers in order to compare the FCC's tactics in various cases.  Still, for pragmatic purposes, accepting the FCC's regulation of the broadcast system (which is, from a legal point of view, publicly owned) is necessary.  Does that mean the standards shouldn't change?  Of course not.  The standards are practically barbaric (I'm surprised we can say "pregnant" on air with the way Michael Powell's feverish little rat brain works).  I just see no problem with FCC regulation overall.  In a "general sense."

      For once  urlLink  Tim makes sense.   He is right to mock my not very interesting story.  His comment only underscores why I generally don't tell these kinds of stories here.  Were I having affairs with certain famous guests, it would be another story.  And, I think Tim just earned his place as my official biographer by coming up with what is bound to be the title of my life-story.  "Where's the Anal?"

      I will admit forthrightly that I am not very good with economics.  It's the one area of the basics sciences in which I literally have no clue.  People start in with their GDP's and their Keynes and their whatnots and whosits and I zone out completely.  Still,  urlLink  this column at Slate  does a nice job to explain some basic (if still odd) concepts to me, about the value of human life and the reasons we should execute computer virus designers.  However, the author leaves the door open for non-execution punishments with this brilliant passage:   There's one exception to this reasoning: Maybe there's an alternative and less drastic punishment that is highly effective against vermiscripters and not against murderers. If we can effectively deter malicious hackers by cutting off their supply of Twinkies or crippling their EverQuest avatars, then there's no need to fry them. Whether that would work is an empirical question.

      I'm breaking my "don't-talk-about-your-boring-life" rule again, but this time with good cause.  Ben  urlLink  compares Rufus Wainwright to a member of Emerson's Alliance for Gays, Lesbians and Everyone [EAGLE]  and I think I might have some insights.  I once served, briefly and badly (I was sort of the, I don't know,  urlLink  William Henry Harrison  of gay presidents) as President of this august organization.  I totally agree with Ben that it's ridiculous to say you're willing to "die" protesting the Republican National Convention. Obviously, I doubt it's true.  And secondly it implies that one could easily die at such an event.  (I imagine the Roof saying something like, "In 2000, the Republican Guards killed 886 protestors and are holding 1407 more prisoners somewhere outside L.A.")  Still, I think the comparison to moody EAGLE members is off.  Here are my reasons:  1. EAGLE members only protest two things: 1. The Rev. Fred Phelps (of  urlLink  God Hates Fags   fame and 2. Emerson College comedy magazine such as the Hyena which happen to make gay jokes that are quite funny.  What this boils down to is that whereas Rufus wishes to protest in order to express himself, EAGLE protestors seek to limit the expression of others, even when that expression is only offensive if you are a humorless, hypersensitive fag. (that meaning the hyena, not Phelps, who is offensive even to people like me, who also thinks he's kind of funny.)  2. EAGLE members are not moody.  EAGLE has only about 6 real members, the rest only come when they break up with their boyfriend/girlfriend, in search of fresh meat.  The membership of EAGLE then, is dominated by kids looking to get screwed.  (Though that also might describe Rufus Wainwright as well . . .)  3. Why should a gay musician automatically be compared to a gay student group and not, say, EBONI or AASIA or AMIGOS or any of the other poorly acronymed minority organizations at Emerson?  4. I know EAGLE is the worst name ever.  ("Um, is this the bird watching club?")  But tradition forbade us from changing it.  I mean, what was our other option?  Emerson Coalition For Gays, Lesbians, Transgendered, Transsexual, Transmutational, Bisexual, Trisexual, Pansexual, Polyamorous, Two-Spirited, Questioning People and the "Straight" Friends?  (ECGLTTTBTPPTQP"S"F isn't so great an acro either, really -- and honestly, I once met a representative from a gay free-Mumia group and they serious had a name like that, it was sad).  And as far the "everyone" goes, well we tried to reach out.  One particularly horrifying fag hag who liked to tell me about how her boyfriend beat her with a riding crop and who beat me at Dragtoberfest '99 (which should allow some of you to deduce who she was) was nearly elected as my co-president until she decided she would rather spend Tuesday nights getting beaten with a riding crop.  5. Full Disclosure: I might sound a little bitter here.  I will admit up front that I was easily the worst president that group ever had (or at least worse than the other ones I worked with over the years at EC).  I will also admit that I was more or less shunned from the "gay community" at Emerson after I defended the Hyena, and got in a rather nasty e-mail fight with a former Emerson student, who called me a "spineless coward" and a "supporter of hate."  I called him the "gay gestapo" (even though, to my knowledge, he was not gay.  I think he was the 'Everyone') and well, it went downhill from there.  If I am bitter, it is entirely EAGLE's fault.  And DeWayne Dickerson's.

       urlLink  Ben posts Dan Savage's piece on the morning after pill  which also serves as Savage's rebuttal to critics who claim he is an oppressor for telling fat girls to lose weight.  Savage often does this -- either using letters seeking real advice as a way to segue into writing what amounts to a political column and not an advice column (which he did often in the run up to the war in Iraq, which he supported) or to ignore the criticisms against him.  He also posts the most egregiously offensive e-mails he received, instead of ones more likely to have been balanced.  Savage is right on about Plan B.  This fight has been long ongoing.  We were talking a great deal about it back in my days at  urlLink  MassNARAL  and the decision by the FDA is an egregious case of religious motivations stalling access to medication.  Only the most fanatical of religious voices actually believe that un-implanted fertilized eggs are "babies" (most fertilized eggs never implant anyway).  The health dangers of the drug are minor (despite certain instances of spontaneous miscarriage this caused in certain people we know who were unknowingly pregnant when they took the pill), less significant in most cases than over-the-counter enemas or antihistamines.  Widespread, conscientious, proper use of Plan B could dramatically end the need for abortion in this country.  Abortion opponents should love this pill, but they do not.  Which only proves that their devotion is not to "life," but instead to preventing women from making medical decisions about their bodies without religious and legal interference.  Savage nails the points in his usual eloquent way.  Problem is, this doesn't deflect him from criticism from the fatties in the room (myself included).  Savage is absolutely right to point out the health problems contingent in obesity.  Still, that in no way justifies Savage's crusade to get fat people to cover their flesh.  Since when did Dan Savage, an incredibly attractive man with very fucked up teeth, become the attractiveness tsar anyway?  To Savage there are two problems with fat: it is unhealthy and it is ugly.  The fact that these two positions manage to maintain equal status in his analysis shows how bankrupt it is.  Fat may well be unattractive to him.  But enormous muscle mass is unattractive to me, as are moustaches without beards, or cock-eyed bastards like Ralph Nader.  Still, I would never use a column I write (or my blog) to insist that muscleboys keep their clothes on so I don't have to see their unsightly mounds of grotesquely misshapen flesh.  This reminds me of a recent  urlLink  "Tell Me About It"  column (by the Washington Post's amazing Carolyn Hax), in which a reader says that her parents claim her boyfriend has nothing in common with her, and include "height" in with race and religion in their list of dissimilarities.  Savage's inclusion of the ugliness of fat in his analysis only proves how shallow the whole thing is.  If he hates ugly people (or people he thinks are ugly at least) then he has every right to (I certainly have made no bones about making mean comments when it suits me), but don't try to hide behind a woman's right to reproductive choice, Danny boy.  Even   you're  too fat to get away with it.

      I know I promised that Fagistan would not be a diary of my life.  For one thing, my life is so much more boring than, say,  urlLink  Washingtonienne's .  The only interesting things I do or think about are posted here as, you know, essays.  I also promised never to write about work (I did not promise this to you, but to myself, as it only makes good sense) --  But tonight something occurred as work that I feel obligated to share.  I went outside for a breath of fresh air and to look around the property to see if anything ill was going down, only to find two people crouched in the middle of the road, intermitantly weeping and whispering to one another.  Obviously they were a couple having some kind of fight and/or break-up scene.  It was really embarrassing for me, as I didn't notice them until I was almost stepping on them and then had to give them an embarrassed "Oh, excuse me" and turn heel and run.  Is the middle of a traffic-bearing street really the best place to be huddled up, nearly invisible, in the midst of a sense-depriving fight?  (they did not notice me either, and barely paused when I spoke to them.)  People need to learn some important skills, like not making public spectacles of themselves or endangering their own lives for the sake of writing more drama on their LiveJournals.  This doesn't quite rank with the best incident I had, which was when a suspicious car was parked in the driveway for a long time and I went to check it out only to find a guest giving a man a hand job.  Had I been the man, I'd definitely be blogging about my life instead of this politics and culture crap.

      Slate's Dahlia Lithwick  urlLink  writes about Sandra Day O'Connor  and carries a link to  urlLink  an older Slate piece  on her.  Despite my (far more occassional than one would think) disagreements with Justice O'Connor, she is a judicial hero of mine.  Not only for her trailblazing efforts as both judge and politician, but because at some point I realized that the partisan division of the Court is bad for justice.  That the political appointment, and political Senate confirmations, of judges has poisoned the well of law in this nation.  What strikes me most about O'Connor is not that she is a "moderate" (she very often is not -- except on issues like abortion, where she seeks to build a rational balance rooted in law) but that her decisions are eclectic and clearly driven by a forceful reading of US Constitutional Law.  Anthony Kennedy is a moderate.  Sandra Day O'Connor is a Justice who has managed to transcend politics in favor of legal interpretation.  These articles do a good deal to show her for what she is, and not what liberals so often think of her as (the fifth justice in the 5-4 Florida decision, for instance.)  And, speaking of Florida, don't try to throw that in my face.  The recount began because judges said it should, why shouldn't judges say it should stop? Properly speaking, the Supreme Court (although using tortured logic) restored vote counting to its proper sphere -- the political.  Furthermore, I may be alone among Democrats who are brave enough to admit that no amount of recounting would have delivered Florida to Gore.  Whether or not he won (he probably did) in theory, matters little since the voting machine errors were insurmountable at the counting table.  The only fair outcome was the Bush win, as messy as the whole matter was.  I can't really fault the Court for acting the way it did -- and matching the Florida Supreme Court's partisan thunder with some of its own.

      This is a little old . . . (i.e. from last week) but  urlLink  The Onion  has a great  urlLink  "What Do You Think"  column on Michael Moore's new movie.  Best line comes from "Walter Reed -- Systems Analyst":    So Eisner, Moore, and the Weinsteins are involved in the story of Bush and bin Laden? Is anyone decent a part of this at all?

      Salon carried a couple of interesting pieces today.  One discusses  urlLink  whether Christians should file-share .  One student at UCSD published this  urlLink  "Christian Perspective"  (which actually neatly summarizing non-Christian file-sharing dissenters' positions as well).  Still, the messages seem fairly mixed.  Unsurprisingly it is the Christian music trade groups that are most eager to call file-sharing a sin, and the UCSD student's argument that it is a Christian's duty to follow even dumb laws is a little creepy (He compares file-sharing to a law saying you should put your left shoe on first.)  He also defends the sinful practice of illegally reproducing religious films, like The Passion of the Christ, quoting a typically Pauline passage in the Bible about rejoicing that Christ's word is preached, even if it is preached by sinners.  The guy even says "God can use even sinfulness to spread his Word."  That line is particularly disturbing to me, and I'm not even a Christian.  God should, obviously, have nothing to do with sin.  If he does, then why should we try so hard not to do it?  The second article deals with the fact that  urlLink  Rush Limbaugh is the only long-format talk-show host on Armed Forces Radio .  It's mostly in the vein of everything else Salon writes about Limbaugh, and has all the same flaws.  The article's title is "Limbaugh Forced Conscripts."  The implication here is that those who disagree with Limbaugh are forced to listen to his program (they are not) and that the lack of balance on the network should be troublesome to the tax-payers who support it.  Of course, this comes form Democrats who apparently think Al Franken should also appear on the network.  That it comes from Democrats -- who have traditionally supported programs like like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, programs that are overwhelmingly liberal in their grant-making, is at best a little hypocritical.  It also fails to note that bringing real balance to the airwaves would be impossible (the only way to manage it would be to kill political content, which can hardly serve our soldiers) -- since giving two partisans the chance to try to win converts ignores the huge sea of people who are independents, or who are (like me) members of a party but not necessarily totally in line with the party's liberal/conservative line.  Furthermore, Salon continues to pretend that  urlLink  David Brock and his sloppy "think tank"  are a credible source.  The article quotes Brock, and his personal soap-box Media Matters, over and over again (Media Matters can also be found quoted in Salon's generally great summary of Right Wing opinions,  urlLink  Right Hook ).  Using as your main Democratic sources Al Franken and David Brock doesn't give much credibility to the arguments.  Although the author is right to point out that there is an obvious difference between Limbaugh and NPR's "Fresh Air" (which the director of armed services radio sites as giving the network "balance"), and a strong case is made for Howard Stern being added to the roster on AFR (based on his ratings), the piece still wallows in the persecuted liberal complex that is ruining Salon and may possibly ruin liberalism in America.  Why are we spending so much time fighting over Limbaugh on the radio?  Aren't there, you know, some other major issues that we should be challenging Republicans on -- like education reform, budget deficits, foreign policy, energy prices, deregulation, etc?  This kind of hand-wringing idiocy only serves to distract us from real issues, and from taking action to bring about progress in this nation.  It's time the Salon got its groove back.

       urlLink  Ben quotes some good ole Rufus Wainwright .  Ben seemed somewhat disturbed by what Rufus said.  Nothing Ben quoted was that inflammatory -- at least he doesn't blame all of America for President Boosh-Douche  Also Ben, I enjoy the baptized in cum line.  I don't see why politics and sex can't me mashed together into one pop-rock-piano-ballad.  And speaking of cum baptisms, the weirdest thing has happened now, not once but twice.  On two different computers.  When I type in the address to Ben's site (as opposed to link over to it for instance), which is www.whinecoloredsea.blogspot.com something else occassionally comes up.  It is the same site each time and of particular interest because of its brilliant content.  Go here to see  urlLink  Ben's alternative site.   Has this happened to anyone else?  Please note that the address (which I won't type so as not to ruin the experience) is NOTHING like Ben's blog address.  I begin to think Ben might be the Messiah, Risen before our very eyes!

      The Mayfield case is likely to raise a number of questions about civil liberties, as it certainly should.  But the questions that need to be raised most are not about PATRIOT Act, religious persecution or material witnesses.  The real villain in this story is fingerprinting.  Fingerprint evidence was created by law enforcement and is based on what amounts to an assumption: each of us has entirely unique and identifiable fingerprints.  This may be true in theory, but the differences are often so minute that multiple experts are almost always used to confirm the source.  When a print is difficult to read (smudged, partial, overlaid on other prints) it can be almost impossible to do an accurate match.  When fingerprints are being matched by photograph (as in Mayfield's case) room for error grows rapidly.  Despite the flaws in the system ( urlLink  detailed in this  New Yorker  piece ) we continue to view fingerprints as unassailable.  A recent Washington Mutual Bank commercial features a "lying lawyer" saying to a jury "Are fingerprints really 'evidence?'  I don't think so," as the punchline to a joke.  This wholesale acceptance of an evidentiary tool as scientific (no one feels the same about eyewitness accounts, and DNA testing always features the 1 in 50 million appellation, implying a chance for error, as fingerprinting does not) is a serious danger to our justice system.  If Spanish authorities had not been conducting a separate investigation, Brandon Mayfield would almost certainly have gone to prison for a crime he did not commit, based only on fingerprint evidence.  It's high time that we make sure juries understand that they should not convict someone only on fingerprints and that we conduct serious scientific work on the method in general.

      A federal judge today  urlLink  dismisses the case against "material witness" Brandon Mayfield .  The FBI later apologizes.  This case raises a few concerns on my part.  1. Was Mayfield targeted because he is a Muslim?  Difficult to tell.  An affidavit released by the judge shows that FBI agents included Mayfield's wife's nation of birth (Egypt), a call she made to a Muslim charity on the terror-watch list, Mayfield's attendance of a suspect mosque, and his representation of one of the "Portland Cell" of terrorist-conspirators in a child-custody case as reasons to be suspicious of him.  These things all have his religion in common for certain, and the FBI also seized client files of people with "Arabic sounding" last names.  I'm still not going to make a judgment here -- as most of these items (other than his wife's nationality) also have links to known or suspected terrorists, even if those links are ridiculous and offensive to our legal principles-- especially his decision to represent one of these people in court.  There are many problems here, but I'm not sure his religion was a direct spur to action by the US Attorney's office or the FBI.  2. Spanish authorities began to question the FBI's fingerprint analysis a full three weeks  before  Mayfield was arrested.  Why is that FBI agents only went to Spain to collect the original print last weekend, five weeks after the Spanish raised their questions and two weeks after Mayfield was arrested?  Also, FBI affidavits show that they believed they had convinced Spanish authorities they had made the correct match.  So, here we have FBI agents who are working only with copies of the fingerprint lobbying to convince the police agents of the nation that was attacked that an American citizen was involved in the crime.  This reeks of persecution and raises some questions (that I'll address in another posting) about the fingerprinting system.  3. Sneak and peek searches were conducted at Mayfield's home under the provision of the PATRIOT Act (and done fairly ineptly, as Mayfield testifies that he was aware they were occurring).  There is no justification for sneak and peek, as these clearly violate constitutional rights of the accused to have a warrant presented to them before their home is searched.  This goes beyond Mayfield's case, and should worry each of us individually.  When will the FBI decide that your associates make you suspicious and break into  your  home and tamper with your belongings in search of "evidence" without you ever knowing?  Have they done it already?  That being said -- federal authorities did not hold Mayfield for an excessive period of time (material witnesses can be held indefinitely).  They have been clearly overzealous and have almost certainly violated Mayfield's rights -- but the material witness law has its uses, and may well have been applied appropriately in this case (to detain him as the investigation concluded, to prevent his flight.)  I'm also a bit disturbed by the reasoning given by Mayfield's lawyer for his refusal to be deposed (authorities offered to release him much sooner if he'd agree to a deposition.)  The lawyer says: "The government can, and in the past has, brought people into a grand jury and set them up with questions to which they know answers and that sets them up for a perjury prosecution,"   This is true, and entrapment of a witness is a serious offense.  But, this statement from the lawyer assumes that Mayfield at least had something to lie about and probably that he intended to lie if deposed.  Perjury traps can only catch perjurers, afterall.  An investigation into FBI conduct in this case should go forward, and Mayfield almost certainly will (and should) bring a lawsuit against the government for his treatment and their mangling of the case.  An apology is all well and good, but the potential damage to Mayfield's livelihood and the danger now posed both to his person and those of his wife and children will not be so easily undone.

       urlLink  Sully pounds it home on the Communion debate .  I try not to poke my head into such matters, for the simple reason that I'm not a Catholic and therefore have no right to tell Catholics or their leaders what to believe.  Part of me admires the Church for attempting to enforce its moral code (to claim to be faithful, only to pick and choose one's beliefs is a little too weak-spined for my tastes) and part of me is horrified by the the implications.  So, the only thing I will add to Sully's piece is something that he misses.  Although he rightly understands that this will only serve to drive Democrats out of the Church (and the Church out of the Party that did the most to integrate Catholic immigrants into mainstream American life), he fails to mention exactly why this will happen.  Various church leaders have declared that those who support abortion (or, in some cases, even vote for someone who supports abortion) should be denied Communion.  Abortion is one of the greatest evils in the world in Catholic eyes.  But so is the death penalty, and unjust wars (including the conflict in Iraq).  So shouldn't Antonin Scalia or Rick Santorum also be denied the body and blood of Christ for their support of the death penalty and of war?  For that matter, what about Catholics who support contraceptives or who have premarital sex?  And what about the fact that the divorced Edward Kennedy continues to receive Communion despite an existing prohibition on the divorced doing so?  In order for my above statement of admiration for the Church trying to enforce its laws to have any validity, the Church must be willing to take this as far as it can go.  And one more point: I find it difficult to believe that a body of bishops, like the American Conference of Bishops, who are collectively culpable in (at least the cover-up) of practically institutionalized child abuse think they have the moral weight to deny John Kerry the Communion.  When they deny themselves Communion for having committed, or having allowed others to commit, grave crimes against generations of Catholic children, then they can look their congregants in the eye with a straight face and say "You are denied the Eucharist."

      I don't have the ability, at this moment, to give much cohesive analysis of the President's speech tonight.  Of course, his speech doesn't require much analysis, making my job easier.  The President laid out five steps to a free Iraq.  I doubt anyone can disagree with these steps ("rebuild infrastructure") -- the real problem is that they are not steps, in the sense that they will mostly happen simultaneously.  There is also nothing very specific here.  We still don't know what body we will be handing "sovereignty" over to on June 30 (and we have no intention of handing full sovereignty over anyway, as our troops will remain indefinitely), the President lays out no real, concrete steps to achieving each of his goals.  It's good that he's finally talking to us about his plans, but it would be nice to have some real substance.  Okay, so there was some substance, including the decision by Bush to approach the United Nations about taking part in the rebuilding after after June 30.  International support in the rebuilding effort is key, both because we can't maintain 138,000 US troops in Iraq forever and also because we need to make sure that the "sovereign government" isn't being propped up by a heavily American force.  American soldiers escorting the President of Iraq around looks more like puppet-government than free-and-open-Arab-democracy.  Let's hope the president is actually committed to internationalizing the effort in a major way.  The President also gave details on the goings on in some hot-spots (Karbala, Fallujah, etc) which was much needed, if not exactly on-topic.  This speech was decent, I suppose, but certainly failed to live up to its promise.  And I'm still concerned that beyond some general and obvious statements about increasing Iraqi security, the Bush team may still have no clue what it's doing.

      Why is Heather Havrilesky, of Salon's  urlLink  "I Like To Watch"  such an f'ing genius?:   But my disappointment doesn't end there. Of all shows, you'd think that "The O.C." could handle an unwanted pregnancy without resorting to the same self-conscious path: "I know I'm just a midseason girlfriend, but I'm far too honorable to remove a 2-week-old zygote from my loins. I'd rather sacrifice my young life to the cause of raising the baby of my violent fiancé/unavailable midseason boyfriend." "I understand completely, young lady, because when I was younger, I removed a blastocyst from my uterus and it's traumatized me ever since. The only proper thing is to carry that fertilized egg to term, raise that unwanted child on a waitress' salary and suffer the consequences of being a hideous whore donkey for the rest of your days on earth."

      Dick Armey became one of the Republicans I most reviled somewhere around the time he called openly gay congressman Barney Frank "Barney Fag."  In retrospect, this moment was far more hilarious than I give it credit for -- but at the time I would never have imagined naming my blog Fagistan.  Armey's leadership in the House was so consistently and viciously conservative, his views so contrary to my own (he is anti-gay, anti-abortion, anti-tax, anti-social services spending) and so damned effective (in combination with Speaker Gingrich and whip Tom DeLay) that hating him was the obvious choice.  Salon has  urlLink  published a profile  of the former majority leader that begins to change my mind.  First of all, Armey proves himself to have a sense of humor, both about himself and about government.  In reference to Dick Gephardt speaking at the hanging of Armey's portrait in statuary hall, he says "He said he couldn't resist being there to hang me."  And later, on his urging of Bush not to invade Iraq: "I was so desperate I quoted Shakespeare instead of Jimmy Buffett."  What comes across most strongly is that, unlike the poseur President Bush , Armey really is a "regular guy."  I won't say I miss him -- but I am encouraged by his assessment that the President's budget policies will drive so much support away from him that Kerry will win in November.  We agree on almost nothing, Dick Armey and me, but we do agree that the Republican Party has lost any reason it once had for existing.  With its spending policies, tax policies and war policies combined the GOP has become the party of big government minus a treasury, the worst possible system one can imagine.  Soon enough, Republicans must either revolt against Bush or sink into the swamp of their own folly.

      After having defended Hollings in my own words, I almost don't want to publish his own response to the charges of anti-semitism.  Not because he is so much more eloquent than me, but because his speech is almost embarrasingly difficult to follow.  It is presented as his speech against reclassifying some nuclear waste in South Carolina into low-level from high-level waste.  That makes it hard enough -- but his remarks are not well prepared and he rambles and moves around a lot.  Still, the overwhelming impression he leaves is one of a strong support for Israel (which he calls "our principle interest in the Gulf") and admiration for those he criticised (he even says that it's possible he once employed Paul Wolfowitz).  It's not necessarily worth reading, but if you want to get his side of the story go  urlLink  here .

      Tim  urlLink  rips me a new one  for my not very nice attack on his writing about Sen. Ernest Hollings.  I will not pretend that I only accidentally lumped Tim in with Zionist extremists (the title of my post was A Lion of Zion afterall).  I'm not exactly sorry either.  I stand by the fact that Tim's reading of Hollings's column was wrong, and that his focus on the specific Jewish people that Hollings implicates in a particular policy does not in any way prove Hollings is an anti-semite.  When one questions a theory, one should also question its main proponents, whatever their religion.  That being said, Hollings does give the impression that these Jews have a good deal more influence over the president than they do.  Wolfowitz is certainly very much a piece of the president's war cabinet, of course, but Hollings' claim that Wolfowitz's theory is paramount in Bush's policy is probably off.  Bush's rhetoric speaks endlessly of democracy in Iraq, but that is (in my assessment) more rhetorical than actual -- and will fade the worse the situation gets there.  The real motivations for the war were cooked up by less subtle and intelligent minds than Wolfowitz's (i.e. Rumsfeld, Cheney, Armitage), and merely cloak themselves in Wolfy's ideas for the sake of looking pretty.  I will even go out on a limb and defend Wolfowitz.  He and Condoleezza Rice are easily the two most gifted foreign policy experts in the Administration, and the two who manage to present the most sophisticated (if, in the end, still reactionary) analyses of policy options.  Even if Wolfy is wrong that democracy in Iraq/Syria/Iran/Libya (notice that he does not mention Saudi Arabia or Jordan, two despotic regimes we'd prefer remain despotic, apparently) will lead to long-lasting security for Israel, he is at least trying to develop a new way of approaching the situation, which is more than Bill Clinton (or Fritz Hollings) can say.  I also did not mean to leave the impression that I think Hollings's New Deal democrat status should shield him from criticism.  I merely meant to allow our good readers to understand that Hollings is not just the Senator who hated Beavis and Butthead, or the one who hates Paul Wolfowitz, but also the one who has fought the good fight for working class people for longer than any other Senator (with the partial exception of Senator Kennedy).  As with so many public servants, one must decide if the good is worth the bad.  In Hollings's case, I err on the side of "yes it is."  Tim certainly does not.  Since neither of us are South Carolinians (to my knowledge) neither of our opinions on that issue really matter.  So, as a final note, Tim: I apologize for calling you a Zionist extremist, but I do not apologize for saying you were being overly sensitive to the Hollings column, or that your assessment was deeply flawed.  ps: another interesting Hollings fact -- if you read through almost any of his speeches posted on  urlLink  his webpage  you'll discover that the Senator is very fond of the phrase "whoopee!" as in "whoopee for democracy!"

      Add  urlLink  Richard Lugar , senior Senator from the great state of Indiana, to the list:    "To win the war against terrorism, the United States must assign U.S. economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority that we assign to military capabilities.  Military action is necessary to defeat serious and immediate threats to our national security. But the war on terrorism will not be won through attrition, particularly since military action will often breed more terrorists and more resentment of the United States.    Democrats have been saying this for a long time, but since when we say it conservatives claim we're latter-day Copperheads, it is nice to hear it from an elder statesman, and a staunch conservative, of the GOP.

      I guess I should chime in here on the Cannes fiasco.  I know that Cannes sort of prides itself on giving awards to movies that divide audiences and that lots of people hate.  I happen to think that the juries generally don't do half-bad in their selections.  Obviously, I haven't seen Moore's movie, and so it's possible (if by a very long shot) that it was the best film in competition.  Still, regardless of how deserved it was, certain things need to be pointed out.  1. Notice the difference in Moore's fawning acceptance of a prestigious award in France and his pompous fucking idiot act at the Academy Awards.  The faux-injured sound of his "The last time I was on an awards stage all Hell broke loose" makes me want to puncture my ear drums to avoid hearing any more.  Obviously MM realizes that all hell broke loose not because he  won  an award he didn't deserve, but because he made a stupid and inflammatory speech at what many members of the Academy deemed to be an inappropriate time.  He also realizes that "all hell breaking loose" was exactly what he hoped to accomplish. It's the only thing he does well, afterall.  2. Was Tarantino actually  crying  as Moore accepted the award?  What a douche.  3. Tarantino's a douche #2: Ebert  urlLink  quotes QT as saying : "This prize was not for politics. It won because it was the best film."  Okay, so let us suspend disbelief in honor of fairness.  Let us assume this was the best film in competition.  How could it not be "for politics?"  Political films can be great in the service of bad politics (Leni anyone?), but their greatness is directly tied to their political character.  You can't give an award to a political film, especially a documentary, without politics effecting it.  If a brilliant filmmaker had made a fawning portrait of Bush's leadership, could they have won in Cannes?  If Moore had made a film that was apolitical, could he have won?  The answer to both is probably a no, and beside the point anyway.  Moore did win for a political documentary that attacks the President.  For the award to go to a political film and then for Tarantino to deny politics as a factor is demeaning both to Moore's movie and to the genre of political cinema.  It is also an apparently pussy-ass attempt to cover the festival's ass.  "We disavow any parts of this film that make people angry . . . but it was still the best one around."  Shut up Tarantino.  Go back to making crappy movies and leave us in peace.  God I hate his face.  I am not doing very well at suspending judgment until the movie's release, as I had promised I would do.  I hope I'm not poisoning the well.  When this movie finds a distributor that isn't a bigger pussy than Tarantino I promise to view it fairly and assess it appropriately.  Still, don't expect me to drop to my knees and suck on Michael's Palme D'or anytime soon.

      I have finally remembered the only good and true reason to support gay marriage:  my healthy and beautiful 13 year relationship with my husband, Rivers Cuomo.  We are still struggling to have babies (my womb is a bit like Courtney Cox Arquette's, but don't worry, the millions of babies will arrive someday!)  Two days ago, I went to the music store is search of a Marty Robbins greatest hits album they didn't have and instead bought tons of other crap.  My purchases included the new  urlLink  Deluxe Edition of Weezer's Blue Album  and  urlLink  the Weezer DVD .  To make this particular incident a bit humiliating, I also purchased a beautiful two-disc Buddy Holly collection and was wearing my Weezer T-shirt.  I think the cute indie rocker man who rang me up was a little horrified.  I won't really "review" either the CD or the DVD.  I mean, the album has been out for a long time now, and it's mind-bending, totally radical awesomeness is never in doubt.  The "deluxe" addtion, which is a second CD of some b-sides and alternate takes of various songs, is pretty kick-ass too.  My copy of the blue album was very old and sad, having purchased it when I was in Middle School or some shit.  It skipped during "Say It Ain't So" and "Holiday" which are two of the greatest songs in the universe.  This often made me cry out in pain.  It was either that or the fact that I was carving "Mrs. Rivers Cuomo" into my thigh with a penknife.  Anyway, everyone should certainly consider going out and buying my husband's new deluxe edition, whether or not your old one skips.  Because it's fun to buy new Weezer things, and as soon as he makes enough money he's buying me new tits.  The DVD is also awesomeness personified.  Well, I guess not personified.  It's not a person.  But it does make me moist.  Watching the oldest Weezer videos is a little startling, as the dorky gawkiness of the band is so charming in comparison to their more matured dorky-coolness of late.  There is some very funny footage of the band being weird as well.  My only complaint?  My husband was apparently too busy making babies with me to show up to record commentary for the DVD, so it is everyone else but him, including the new bassist guy, Scott, who was not even in any of the videos except the ones for  Maladroit  and he keeps saying "Oh man, this is the song that made me want to be in your bnad."  ("Say It Aint' So," which just so happens to be the song that made me want to be filled up with Rivers' babies) or "I saw this video in the gym and I was so happy for Weezer.  I was like Weezer is gonna rule the world!" ("Hash Pipe" which we can all admit is one of the most hot-damn, load-busting videos out there) (second parenthetical note: I have been talking to General Musharraff about the whole "Weezer ruling the world" thing.  Details to come.)  Also someone (it's hard to tell as all indie rockers sound the same) actually makes the mildly ridiculous claim that "'Island in the Sun' is my favorite Weezer song."  Also inlcuded are the insanely forgettable TV spots for the albums.  In a spot for the blue album two girls' voiceovers are mumbling about how much they love 'Undone-The Swweater Song' and one of them says "If you married a Weezer, you'd be Susan Weezer."  Listen, bitch, you stay AWAY from my man!  I've got a knife, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Susan Weezer my ass.  You'll be Susan Dead-Slut if you mess with the Weez.  Okay, fine, Susan.  Sorry, for the outburst.  You can have Pat.

      Last night  SNL  aired a "Best of Christopher Walken" episode.  Two observations:  1. During such retrspectives they should edit out the portion of the opening monologue where the host announces the night's musical guest.  This only leads to disappointment on the part of fans of said guest.  This rule should especially be followed when we are discussing  urlLink  my husband's band.   2. Christopher Walken is not funny.  What happened?  I totally thought he was.  When I think back on his appearances on the show, I always do so with a smile.  But in watching a retrospective of what is supposed to be his "best" work, I was shocked to find that almost none of the scenes were funny!  Some of it was surely not his fault (Southerners pronouncing Colonel Angus as "kunnel angus" is only funny once or twice, not 80 times in 3 minutes, and any scene with chris parnell in it is bound to suck major hardcore baboon ass) but still.  It was excruciating.  Which makes me wonder: are other classic performances on  SNL  as bad as I don't remember them being?  I think specifically of the genius that was Steve Forbes, or the wonder of John McCain, but also of the less kitschy and more important turning point in my decison to like Gwynneth Paltrow, which was her appearance on this very show.  Oh, comedy, why hast though forsaken me?

      Sources in the Kerry campaign and the Democratic Party confirmed that they are considered  urlLink  delaying Senator Kerry's acceptance of the nomination until several weeks after the convention .  The reason behind this move is to delay the federal spending limits for a general campaign for as long as possible.  The Republican Convention is occurring five weeks later than the Democratic Covention, and far later than any convention in the history of national nominating conventions, allowing Bush/Cheney to continue to spend their campaign booty for that much longer.  The fundraising aspect makes sense, I'll agree.  And the insistence of Gillespie and Racicot that the Republican convention had to be so late so as not to interfere with the Olympics is a ridiculous excuse for what is an obvious bid to avoid spending limits for five weeks while Democrats adhere to them.  So, why should Kerry still accept the nomination?  For one thing, it's just plain silly not to.  Bush campaign people are already getting a field day from this one.  "Only John Kerry would be for the nominating convention but against the nomination."  What is the point of a convention that doesn't even nominate anyone?  The convention is the last remaining legacy of once powerful political parties, and Kerry's move will only underscore the weakened status of the party in modern politics.  It's bad for Kerry's image.  Although the conventions are mostly a sham anyway, it will only underscore criticisms that the nominee is an elitist who thinks he can write the rules without regard to tradition.  Although this is on a smaller scale, it reminds me of one of the few major political blunders FDR committed, when he tried to rigged the Supreme Court by encouraging Congress to add 6 new seats to the court that he'd be able to fill.  The cynicism behind it is so obvious that even many within the Party won't be able to be comfortable with it.  Kerry is not a snobbish elitist (at least he is less of one than the President, who is never accused of this), but this won't help that all important fiction he must build called image.  Furthermore, no one will watch a convention that won't feature a nomination.  Kerry will not receive the historically typical 5-10 point boost the convention brings.  Five weeks later, Bush will receive his own boost that will likely wipe away what Kerry gained in Boston.  If Kerry gains nothing in Boston . . .well, you get the idea.  It allows Bush to run way ahead at the end of August, and even Kerry's strong-finish style might not pull him over the top.  Therefore, Kerry should accept the nomination, and present a vice presidential candidate in Boston, without delay.  The spending limits are a nasty thing to deal with, and something should be done to make sure that the limits apply more fairly to candidates from both parties, but money is not the most important thing.  Image and approval matter too, and money can't necessarily buy either.

      Tim makes this  urlLink  uncharacteristically lazy assessment  of a column by Senator Hollings.  Supporters of Israel's endless war against the people of Palestine love to claim that their critics are antisemites in disguise.  And, to be fair, many of them  are .  What distresses me most about Tim's implication that Senator Hollings is blaming Jews for the war in Iraq is that it entirely misreads what the Senator said.  Senator Hollings criticized Charles Krauthammer because he has been one of the strongest exponents of a particular pro-Israel Mid-East plan.  To say that the main concern of most American politicians (and most conservative Jewish voters and leaders) in the Middle East is Israel is hardly antisemitic.  It is not even anti-Zionist.  Hollings, as far as I know, is a supporter of the state of Israel.  His disagreement with the president is over what method will make Israel secure.  Hollings does not refute that Israel should be secure.  Even I do not refute that, despite my strong opposition to most of its theocratic and racist policies.  He simply doubts that an evangelical war to bring democracy to Iraq is going to make anyone (Israeli or American or Iraqi) safer.  More troubling than Hollings comments on Israel though, is his clear dismissal of democracy as a tool for building lasting peace in the Middle East.  I certainly sympathize with him.  As much as I love democracy, I have been a fairly strong supporter of Pervez Musharraff (President of both Pakistan and my Ass) if only because with him firmly in power Muslim fundamentalists won't seize it.  The real fear in a "democratic" Iraq is that fundamentalists will seize power.  Andrew Sullivan and others claim that these people (Islamists) don't want democracy at all and will deny it to the good people of Iraq, but in reality that is exactly what democracy may mean in Iraq.  If our only option for democracy is a pro-West, pro-Reform, anti-islam government, than where is the fucking democracy already?  And if we want to ensure a pro-Western, pro-Reform, anti-Islam state we'd sure as hell better not let a vote happen.  Furthermore, trying to force democracy on a nation is probably futile.  Remember, dear Fagistani people, by the time the American Experiment began in 1776, we'd had centuries of slow democratic growth throughout Europe and especially in Great Britain as a model.  Iraq has had only the models of tribal government, imperial caliphates and the bumbling idiots who ran the colonial system post-WWI.  Not too promising for democracy.  And yet, for Sen. Hollings to dismiss it so blithely calls into question his commitment to democratic values in a stark light.  Democracy, as I've said often, is a difficult animal.  I will support it in Iraq, even if the results are bad.  Hollings clearly will not.  But that doesn't mean that he and Mel Gibson are sitting around reading  Protocols of the Elders of Zion  together.  So, Tim, you missed the target on this one.  You let his far-less-than-inflammatory comments on Jews (including high praise of the Israeli secret police) mislead you from his more-than-inflammatory comments on democracy.  And in Fritz's defense, the Senator from South Carolina may be the very last New Deal Democrat on the Hill.  He was alone in the wilderness as he fought to stop the deregulation of the energy industry, going toe to toe with Senator McCain time and again in a vain attempt to maintain government's proper role in essential industry.  McCain won, the thieves at Enron won, and energy consumers from Texas to California to Oregon lost bitterly.  And, to lay Tim's fears to rest, Fritz is retiring this very year.  The Democrat who we all hope will replace him is named Inez Tenenbaum, a woman for whom name alone is qualification for high office.

      For several years now I've been working very hard toward the goal of reading at least one work by each of the literature Nobel laureates.  This blog allows me a place to write my reviews of these works as I read them.  So my first Nobel laureate entry is  urlLink  Kenzaburo Oe , who won the award in 1994 and of whom the Swedish Academy says: "with poetic force [he] creates and imagined world, where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human condition."  I have just finished reading his debut novel  urlLink   Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids  .  Oe's novel is a muted, and small masterpiece.  It is not a towering achievement, but for a first novel it is extraordinary.  The story centers on a group of reformatory school boys who are evacuated to a small village in the Japanese mountains during WWII.  After a plague breaks out in the village, the villagers flee, leaving the boys trapped behind.  The boys struggled to build a community only to have it fall apart in their hands.  The story bears a marked resemblance to a novel by another Nobel laureate, William Golding, whose  Lord of the Flies  covers similar ground.  But Golding uses the decaying innocence of his youthful tribe to show the darkness at the heart of human nature. He provides them with redemption in the form of a ship arriving at the critical moment to save them and return them to civilization.  Golding's novel abhors war, but implicates the children in that war as well, and endorses the concept of civilization.  Uncivilized children left alone on an island are bound to become barbaric monsters, and only the arrival of adults can save them.  Oe's vision is starkly different in its traversing of moral ground.  The novel is as much philosophical as it is narrative, and the universe he creates is one in which the children, abandoned by adults, are allowed to live in a kind of suspension of history.  "Time won't move a step without grown-ups' orders," our narrator asserts.  And indeed, for a brief moment, the outside world is shut off and in this prison the children find true freedom and brotherhood.  Eventually, the outside concerns shatter this dream, as the adults return and treat them with cunning and cruelty.  Oe seeks to break history apart in a way even more radical than the sophisticated sledge-hammer employed by William Faulkner.  Both writers have an intensely anti-historical ideological bent and their works are overwhelmingly ontological.  But whereas Faulkner breaks time apart with the savage weapons of the human mind, Oe shows us characters who are cut adrift from history and who seek to defend their ahistorical position by creating a tribal community based on their own rules and rituals.  The mythic dimensions that Oe explores are profound, if only perhaps half-realized.  Reading this novel is made more difficult by the language barrier.  Oe has a reputation as one of the most daring and inventive of Japanese prose stylists, but that little of that emerges in this translation.  Although he captures beautifully the complex of fear/love/hatred/passion the boys feel, and imbues the entire village and its shadowy borders with a massive sense of mythic-lyrical force, the story itself is told in a rather dry and straightforward matter.  Special props must be given to a man who wrote a novel in the 50s with a prominent male prostitute character.  One whose ass is so destroyed by his profession that he must constantly rub ointments on it.  The novel is a strong one, even if it never quite fulfills its potential.  The surface quivers with unspoken power, but somehow that power is never revealed for us to bask in.  This is not considered to be Oe's greatest work , so I reserve an overall judgment of his place in literature.  Still, whatever minor shortcomings the book has (and they are all minor) it is still a fantastic piece of fiction, if only for the antidote to Golding's flimsy and pat morality that it is.

      Slate is carrying one of the more sophisticated  urlLink  odes to Tony Randall  that I've read.  I'm not a huge Randall fan, and usually don't care much for the eulogies that pop up whenever someone dies.  I am always reminded of my mother's invariable reaction: "He wasn't dead yet?"  (the other response she has is even worse.  When Princess Diana died, we were in Spokane to see a musical that I won't name for humiliating reasons, and she burst into the hotel room with a nasty little grin on her face to announce the news like a kid at Christmas.)  Still, what I like about this article is that it addresses the issue of sexuality in both the Randall/Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies of old and his infamous turn in the TV version of Neil Simon's lame play  The Odd Couple .  What interests me here is a question that comes to me every time I see characters of questionable sexuality: are they meant to be coded, "closeted" characters, or is something more radical happening?  Or perhaps both at once.  Perhaps it is precisely in this space, somewhere between the closet and the living room, that sexuality can be treated most honestly in narrative fiction.  Randall's performances came before Rock Hudson died of AIDS and before the advent of "metrosexuality" (a movement which is not liminal, but instead seeks to further reinforce the gay/straight barrier.)  You can play the "is he gay or not?" game all you want with The Odd Couple and it ends up meaning nothing.  What is interesting about the story (however lame it is in Simon's play) is the fact that these men are building a relationship outside the heterosexist dynamic.  Two divorced men sharing an apartment, and a high degree of intimacy, without having sex.  It presents a vision in which people can choose to build relationships on their own terms, both romantic and platonic.  Similar versions of this relationship play themselves out in other sitcoms, certainly.  Off the top of my head I can think of  My Two Dads ,  Perfect Strangers ,  Friends ,  Bosom Buddies , well you get the idea.  These aren't all great TV shows.  In fact, really, only one of them ( Friends ) is, but they are interesting for that reason.  In a world in which more and more of us are living with "roommates" for longer and longer periods of time, and in which we form close, intimate bonds with those we cohabitate with, even if we're fucking other people, it's important to note that the question of "are they gay or not?" is less and less a useful question.  Sexuality has never been so easily figured -- but television in particular tends to be fairly rigid in constructing sexualities for characters.  It's nice to read about an actor whose entire career was spent walking in the liminal shadows of sex and sexuality.  Most of us are  living  in this liminal space (let's call it the cloakroom) already -- it's time the sexuality debate caught up to the way we're living.

      Or maybe there is.  Jim Armstrong put together this fascinating, and pretty hilarious,  urlLink  list of dumb baseball injuries .  Though, as I think about it, that article is probably "members only" or whatever . . .so for non-AOL folks here are the two best bits (I don't want to clip the whole article, even though it is worth a read if you get a chance):   Too many primas and way too many Donnas. Today's tough kids ride skateboards down railings with nothing but air and cement to break their fall. Either that or they go out for the football team or work the graveyard shift at 7-11, where they fight off drunks in search of microwave burgers and supersized bags of Oreos.  The geeks and nerds, they're the ones playing baseball. How else do we explain the current generation of quiche eaters playing the Pastime Formerly Known as National?   and, my favorite injury listed herein:   Chicks, of course, dig ballplayers despite their many frailties. Which brings me to my all-time favorite baseball injury. Former big-league pitcher and manager Roger Craig once cut his hand on a bra strap. And the amazing part was he admitted it instead of coming up with a legitimate excuse like, say, unzipping his fly.

      To wrap up my probably too-extensive coverage of a book Christopher Hitchens wrote in 1995, I'm going to go a little far afield, that is to say what I have to say now is only inspired by Hitchens work and is not about his book.  In reading MoTo's constant references to the poor "accepting their lot," and "forgiving" the capitalist evil-doers at Union Carbide, I was struck, strangely enough, by how Nietzschean it all was.  Not her behavior per se, but the moral attitude she strikes.  Friedrich Nietzsche, in a number of works, but especially in  Beyond Good and Evil  and  On the genealogy of Morals  (both available in this  urlLink  excellent translation , develops a theory of morality that juxtaposes master to slave moralities.  I'm paraphrasing here, and doing FriNi terrilble injustice, but the master morality is that in which people are able, essentially, to do as they wish, only within their own limits.  The master assumes that all that he does is good, and from that determines that things he does not do are "bad."  The dichotomy here is fairly mild -- things may be undesirable but they are not monstrous.  Slave morality works the other way -- assuming that the characteristics of the masters is "evil" and therefore that their own characteristics are good. The dichotomy is much more threatening here -- and in Nietzsche's view more dangerous, because it elevates to the status of virtues characteristics that are negative.  Humility, altruism, sacrifice, anti-intellectualism, physical weakness, sickness and insanity are re-figured as GOOD THINGS even though they are the very things that make the poor and oppressed into poor and oppressed in the first place.  I have some problems with FN's paradigm -- but think of the ways that MoTo follows this trope.  It is through suffering that the poor achieve heaven, and therefore her work is not so much to relieve suffering as to expedite the movement of souls from Earth to the afterlife.  The renunciation of worldly values only reinforces this idea -- the world may have been cruel, but the purpose is for something better.  Still, slave morality, at its best, can lead to revolutionary things.  Nietzsche himself traces how the most power slave-moral system ever devised is Judaism (and its bastard child, Christianity) because it was able to conquer every major master moral system it encountered.  But in the end, the slave morality requires that the poor and suffering exist (as certain economists insist that a certain level of unemployment is necessary). If there are no oppressed, than how can own attain redemption through poverty (or through helping the oppressed, as MoTo herself clearly claims.)  In the end, either kind of system results in similar things -- the powerful continue to oppress the weak with only minimal safeguards, even if it is all clothed in the language of the slave.  In order for Mother Teresa's system to work, the poor must always be poor, and must "accept" their lot.  In this sense, Christianity as manifested in the form of MoTo and others is not so different from most Eastern religions, which teach that suffering in this life gives us rewards in the next.  All these religious systems serve to reinforce the power structure as it exists.  Nietzsche still would find it unsettling that we did not develop into a race of Masters, and are all, in most ways, slaves, but really what's the difference?  The best form of the master morality might well be a libertarian secular state, in which we are each free to express our will as we see fit, red in tooth and claw.  Am I willing to go so far?  No.  But I am willing to reject the pious apologies of the slaves for their masters.

      For all the fact that she's a crazy reactionary succubus, Ann Coulter is one of the wittiest political pundits around.  This quote (from one of her  urlLink  recent columns)  not only proves that I read, and enjoy, Coulter's work but also that I am not as sensitive about Kerry as  urlLink  certain dirty whores who post comments on my blog  would lead you to believe:   Ben-Veniste demanded to know why the suspected 20th hijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, had not been more aggressively investigated, despite the fact that -- I quote -- he had "no explanation for the funds in his bank account, and no explanation for why he was in the United States."  So let me get this straight: Airport security can't acknowledge that a person is an Arab, but they should be allowed to audit his bank records?  (Come to think of it, "Can't Explain His Bank Account or Why He's Here" is also a pretty good description of John Kerry.)    emphasis mine, of course.

      I'm done with the Hitchens book, having finished it while luxuriating in the bath.  The last sections of this book take another look at some of MoTo's unsavory business, and also provides a nice (if flawed) account of Albanian nationalism.  Problem: Big one this time.  Hitchens clearly creates a logic in which Mother Teresa is not just a product of the very nasty mix of religious and ethnic nationalisms that plague the Balkan states, but also somehow responsible for them.  Oh, he is right to point out that it is a little hypocritical of her to place a wreath on a monument to Mother Albania (when her concern should be all the poor of the world, or at the least, Mother Church), and to heap praise on the counterreligionists who ran Albania with brutality in the Communist days.  Likewise, it's kind of nasty that she spent so much time hobknobbing with Duvalier and supporting contras and all that ill shit in Central America and the Caribbean.  Okay, fine.  But how is she suddenly implicated in the matrix by which Albanian nationalism manifests itself?  Hitchens is wise to give hedging praise to the Yugoslav experiment, and to be equally critical of all sides in this mess, even if he seems to go so far as to say the Kosovars' actual residence on the land is equal to the Serbs having once fought a battle there (a battle which became significant only with the advent of Serb nationalism in the beginning of the twentieth century.)  This same logic of an "historic right" to the land as being as valuable or more valuable than the rights of those who actually occupy it has been used successfully by Israel in their project of ethnic cleansing in Palestine, by China and Russia both in their aggressive conquests of neighboring territories, by Japan and Italy in WWII -- well, you get the idea.  I don't sympathize as much with the Kosovars as many Americans, but Hitchens more or less sides with the Serbs, which is a dangerous game.  And worst of all -- it has nothing to do with his ostensible subject, MoTo.  He inserts his lecture on the evils of nationalism into a discussion of her biography -- giving the reader the impression that the two are the same.  The Catholic church did support fascists -- and continues to do so in many places in the world.  Okay, we get the point, Hitch.  But Albanian nationalism is still, primarily, Islamic in nature, so what's MoTo got to do with it?  Hitchens spends a good deal of time discussing how she is used as a symbol by other groups to achieve their own ends without seeming to realize that he's doing the same thing.  Mother Teresa is a symbol for the church, so his criticism of her religion is really a criticism of the Vatican.  Mother Teresa is Albanian, and therefore can be used to condemn Albano-nationalism.  Few of the criticisms herein are actually of much use in finding out who this woman is.  Hitch's call for a revaluation of her work is all well and good, but he provides only the sketchiest means by which to do it.  He would have been better off using MoTo only anecdotally in his discussion of the real topics of this book: reactionary Catholic politics and reactionary Nationalism.  I agree that Mother Teresa is a reactionary, that she is far more political than she lets on, and that she has used her enormous influence as a figure beyond reproach to spread her particular theocratic/apocalyptic vision of politics far and wide.  She has, like all Catholic leaders, dabbled in fascism and totalitarianism. She may not be as great as we assume she is, but the criticisms in this book that can properly be ascribed to Mother Teresa, and not to the system of which she is a product/part, are rather few and flimsy.  But of course who is going to buy a book called "The Trouble With Reactionary Catholic Doctrine in the Third World?"  No, this book is iconoclastic, and that is the only reason it exists.  I will admit that I enjoyed it -- it's a quick read, and Hitchens is always brilliant and funny and his arguments are meticulous even at their least useful.  He has a style that is unique and that penetrates through the taboos of our culture to really get at his subject in a new way without trashy tabloid tactics (other than the title).  His structure, which mimicks the beatification/canonizaiton process, is clever and satisfying and his patented unwillingness to pull punches is appreciated.  So, I suppose the text of this lengthy review has been mostly negative, but only because I think the book failed in both its purported purpose (of condemning MoTo) and in its revealed purpose (of exposing the hypocrisy in Catholic teaching.)  I have one more MoTo posting to go and then we're done.  Sweet Jesus on the Cross.

      I am nearly done with Hitchens's MoTo book, and so you will soon be able to view my blog without fear of having to read more about dirty nuns.  I promise.  I have just completed reading the last two sections of the 'Good Works and Heroic Virtues' chapter, in which Hitchens addresses more fully MoTo's stances on abortion/reproduction and then deals with her fundraising schemes.  On the issue of abortion and family planning, Hitchens nails it.  He manages to draft this portion of his argument with his fullest exposition on Catholic doctrine yet.  He also acknowledges the good aspect of this deeply fundamentalist take on abortion.  At least Catholic Church leaders are consistent in their condemnation of the taking of life -- whether unborn or born.  Unlike Bush and his kind who support both war and the death penalty while seeking to create a "culture of life" (whatever the fuck that means anyway) and "value every human life."  Of course, a similar argument could be made against those who support abortion but oppose the death penalty.  I can make such statements myself because I have long supported both the death penalty  and  abortion, although I'm increasingly willing to let individual states make their own decisions on both issues.  Hitchens rightly mocks the concept of "ensoulment," although he ignores it's long and amusing history, but then seems to rely on a different idea, what I assume is the "scientific" criterion of "viability," to draw a line at which abortions can be considered immoral. (This I induce from his distinction between first and third trimester abortions, a distinction as arbitrary as the Church's stance, really.)  Hitchens derides the Church's standard for "life" only to allude to a standard of his own that is equally untenable.  Viability is a poor standard for a number of reasons, most obviously because it is not a clear line.  Each pregnancy will result in viability at a different moment, and with modern medical technology we know that the age of viability has been pushed back as far as the second trimester.  The question to me is less one of the morality of "ending a life" than of the right of a woman to seek medical care in privacy without government interference.  Even with children who are definitely living and breathing, we accept the right of parents to make terrible medical choices for them.  Jehovah's Witnesses routinely refuse their children blood transfusions, Christian Scientists reject all medical care, many primitivist sects lack modern medical facilities on their farms.  Some of these things raise an outcry, for sure, but we eventually agree that the parent's right to serve as medical guardian is more or less absolute, and that the right to religious practice is paramount.  How different, really, is abortion?  If a mother can refuse to allow her child life-saving medical procedures, why can she not refuse to carry it to term in the first place?  The best of this section, though, focuses on the issue of contraception.  The incredibly reactionary stances of Mother Teresa to contraception, and the official Catholic line in which contraception is equal in horror to abortion makes it impossible to take the prohibition of abortion seriously and also does tremendous damage throughout the Catholic world.  Hitch also devilishly points out the irony that Catholics' sexual lives are being regulated by celibates.  The difficulties in that authority are obvious, I should think.  Hitchens puts it best when he writes:  The call to go forth and multiply, and to take no thought for the morrow, sounds grotesque when uttered by an elderly virgin whose chief claim to reverence is that she ministers to the inevitable losers in this very lottery.  Then there is the fundraising issue, on which I will write little.  It is Hitchens's strongest indictment of MoTo herself -- as opposed to indicting her religious beliefs.  The amount of money that her movement has hoarded or wasted is enormous, and the number of filthy operators that have helped her amass it is staggering, but since I have no insights to add, or criticisms of Hitch's method, I'll leave it alone.  Although I will say that her pseudo-innocent letter to Lance Ito is one of the greatest things I've ever seen or read.

       urlLink  Log Cabin Republicans denied a table at NC Convention.   When will Republicans (and Democrats for that matter) finally understand that the old Left/Right dichotomy of politics is crumbling around us?  The future of the Republican Party lies the way of Log Cabin, if it hopes to remain dynamic and worthwhile, just as the Democratic Party will eventually have to jettison is foolish and hysterical insistence on gun-control and abortion-without-limits if it wishes to remain a viable party nation-wide.  But how many more years of idiotic leadership can we expect before they get it?

      When Nancy Pelosi ascnded to the Democratic leader's post in late 2002, I praised her far and wide as a fighting Democrat who would be unafraid to take on the President.  Her leadership was, to me, a sign that Democrats finally got it: we won't win by playing nice.  Since then, Pelosi has been fairly reserved and has not lived up to my wildest hopes (although her leadership has been steady and, in most cases, strong.)  Hanging on my wall is a picture of the minority leader from the cover of the  Nation , in fighting mode, to which I've affixed the quote (which is, I hope it's obvious, mine and not hers): "George, your reactionary policies make me so angry I could punch your neck, dickhole!"  Finally,  urlLink  Pelosi punches some necks .  She not only criticising the president fiercely, but actually addresses Iraq, in a way no major Democrat yet has: "Speaking specifically to Iraq, we have a situation where -- without adequate evidence -- we put our young people in harm's way." And on the fairy-tale of jubilant Iraqis cheering on American liberators, Pelosi puts it brilliantly: "Rocket-propelled grenades, not rose petals, greeted them."  It also gives us our first chance to see how Republicans will react.  Tom DeLay, naturally, practically calls Pelosi a terrorist: "Nancy Pelosi should apologize for her irresponsible, dangerous rhetoric.  She apparently is so caught up in partisan hatred for President Bush that her words are putting American lives at risk."  To point out that the President had no plan, continues to have no plan, and is acting in such a reckless, listless way that  he  is putting American lives at risk is beyond the pale for Republicans.  At least in part because they have no real response to her criticism.  Her attack does not encourage terrorists to strike out at American soldiers, nor does it show insufficient support for finishing the job in Iraq.  But, in these days, Republicans have fallen so far that they think Americans will let them get away with such authoritarian bullshit.  In November, they will learn.  And Speaker Pelosi will get to punch lots more necks.

      In the interest of bringing more balanced views to Fagistan, I have offered free blog-space to my  urlLink  Talking Ann Coulter Doll.   I will Give Talking Ann Coulter Doll space here every few days.  Be warned, she may repeat herself on occassion.  I will not sort through her responses for the "best one" as I don't want to be accused of censorship.  Talking Ann Coulter Doll and I have been friends for several months, and I often turn to her for an alternate view on the issues plaguing America.  In the future, also, Talking Ann Coulter Doll will be able to speak wtihout any comment from me.  So, without further ado, here is her response to my latest post (on gay marriage):    The liberal catechism includes a hatred of Christians, guns, the profit motive and political speech, and an infatuation with abortion, the environment and race discrimination.

      Dahlia Lithwick pens a great article in which she tries to discern how far the  urlLink  slippery slope  of gay marriage can go, with plenty of nifty links to other writers on the subject.  She touches on some of the ground I covered here in  urlLink  Why Gay Marriage Doesn't Matter , but with a different emphasis.  She is certainly more pro-marriage than I am, and less willing to admit the flaws in the system of monogamous marriage rights and the even bigger, gaping axe-wound of a flaw that is the system of civil marriage in general.  Another interesting article to read is  urlLink  this more-than-slightly confused piece  in whch the author argues both that banning gay marriage may be bad policy and that we need the Federal Marriage Amendment.  That's not the interesting part, the interesting part is his description of how marriage might work as a system of contracts (a way to avoid the current marriage system altogether, in effect -- though the process could be cleaned up into a neater form if civil marriage were abolished).  Be prepared for some astoundingly convoluted logic in the piece (which also deals with abortion), such as the fact that Roe v. Wade not only "creates the right to abortion" (which it does not, by the way) but also grants "adult men increased power to cover up the fact (via legal means) that they are having illegal sex with a minor."  You know that abortion rights opponents are reaching hard when they come up with mind-bending logic like this.  There is only one good, and only one necessary, argument against abortion: it kills babies.  That's about as bad as it gets right?  "Well, I wasn't quite sure I wanted to ban infanticide, but I'm certain I don't want men to get away with statutory rape!"   Clarification : Of course abortion is not infanticide, but this post was about gay marriage, remember?

      Yet more on Hitch, regarding the first section of the chapter "Good Works and Heroic Virtues."  This section details the actual conditions within her charity operations, revealing that they are not intended as clinics, but as homes for the dying (as the name of one prominent operation, Home for the Dying, suggests).  Patients are given little medical attention or pain relief, even simple operations are refused, conditions are unsanitary (needles re-used for instance) and the list goes on and on.  Homeless men with AIDS in San Francisco are not allowed to watch the Olympics or smoke cigarettes or drink at their friends' funerals.  My answer to all these criticisms of the operation is a resounding: so the fuck what, Hitch?  She is not a doctor and does not claim to be one.  She is not a hospice nurse either.  She is a nun, and her duties are primarily religious.  She seeks to provide some measure of comfort in the last days of a person's life, but that comfort is entirely spiritual.  To claim that she is a monster to adhering to an ascetic brand of Catholicism, or for denying homeless people the right to watch TV is a little too ridiculous for my tastes.  I mean, would these homeless victims of disease be watching TV if they were still sleeping in alleys?  Would they care about the Olympics then?  The real problem here is that Hitchens has yet to make the necessary leap from attacking MoTo to attacking the Catholic Church in general.  Mother Teresa's actions are perfectly in line with church teaching.  Even ones that are slightly unsavory, like the unwilling baptism of Muslims and Hindus, can be seen as an honest attempt to help people enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  If you don't want religion forced upon you, then don't accept charity from the religious.  Seems like a fair plan to me.  Then there is the "cheerful sign" at the morgue "I am going to Heaven today."  Although this reminds me of Billy Graham or whoever saying that the victims of 9/11 wouldn't come back if they were given the chance, it is still brilliantly funny.  I want that sign at the morgue I go to when I die.  As a secularist, I certainly prefer focus on the here-and-now, and MoTo's emphasis is clearly on the hereafter, and Hitchens makes a strong argument that her operation doesn't really help people out that much, beyond giving them a cot to lay in for the brutal final moments.  But does any of that make her a monster?  Hitchens certainly seems to be aiming that high, and yet it has little weight.  At worst she is just another proselytizing religious figure, one who should be commended for actually having strong beliefs and consistency.  I agree that this atittude just reinforces the fact that MoTo and her like don't really care if people die (then they get to go to heaven), but do care that they are born in the first place -- which means that in a sense you could say that the Catholic position is one of long term mass-murder, in which they insist people be born only so that these people can die in terrible misery.  The Church as ultimate sadist.  Mother Teresa is not a terrible woman, she is simply a strong and dedicated disciple of a religious system with some fucked up priorities.   I hope that Hitch will make that connection soon, or all is lost.  For an interesting, and not necessarily pro-religious, look at this phenomenon of liberal moral relativists proclaiming that anyone who truly believes in anything is a monster, go read  urlLink  Slavoj Zizek on  The Passion of the Christ

      Having just completed the first chapter of  Missionary Position , some thoughts:  The chapter recounts the story of the making of a documentary by a team of British journalists/filmmakers.  The documentary, and subsequent book, are the starting point of MoTo's international renown.  Much of the chapter reflects little on the woman herself, and more on the disquieting fascination one of the journalists, Malcolm Muggeridge, has for her.  When they shoot the interior of the sick house on a new type of film and everything comes out perfectly despite the poor lighting conditions, Muggeridge declares it is "divine light" and that he has captured a miracle on film.  His cameraman disagrees, saying it is simply a technological advance.  I'll trust the film expert on this one.  Still, I think it a little weak for Hitch to elliptically blame MoTo for this.  She can't help what all her followers say.  Of course, there are many troubling passages related here, included endless instances in which she proclaims that the work should not be done for itself, but only as a religious duty.  Helping the poor is just another form of prayer, in essence, and "we are not social workers."  Mother Teresa creates a moral and social dynamic in which "helping the poor" is a form of veneration of the Lord, and the poor become little more than a catalyst.  The real action is not between the nuns and the poor, but between the nuns and God, with the poor as something akin to the Eucharist.  Furthermore, there are her disquieting, but entirely Catholic, views on abortion and contraception.  I will not argue with her views on abortion, as I realize how tricky that particular issue is, and can understand (while disagreeing) with the religious stance against it.  I am less reserved about population control however.  As Hitchens points out, "there are many ways to get the population question wrong" (such as sterilization, forced abortion or the disastrous China policy), but MoTo's insistence that "there cannot be too many children" is appalling and grotesque.  Still, for her there can't be too many children, as more poor children mean more chances to venerate the Lord and perform her "good deeds," and more opportunities for miracles to be attributed to her intercession.  Then she says that God always provides, and compares the suffering of the poor to "birds and flowers."  Of course, there  can  be too many birds, and when there are they die in huge numbers.  So, MoTo is advocating, as nearly all conservatives essentially do on the issue of population policy, that we must not do anything to stop babies from being born, but once they are born they must suffer their fate gladly, and die if they must.  Such a policy can in no way be seen as humane or rational.  Whether or not it is spiritual I'll leave to the Pope and the 500 people he's made into saints in the last 25 years.

      Salon has an interesting article on one of the most prominent fascists in America,  urlLink  Michael Savage .  The article's subhead, "Does the FCC care?", is a bit misleading, since the FCC is mentioned only once and the actual question of whether the FCC cares, or should care, about xenopobic, ultra-right-wing authoritarianism on the radio is never addressed.  Still, this article is a good antidote to the mind-numblingly poor coverage of the Savage phenomenon at  urlLink  Media Matters for America .  The title of this post comes from a quote from Savage in the article.  I feel like it should be a joke.  "What's better than an orgasm?  An orgasm!"

      When Dennis Hastert first emerged from the pack of unknown congressmen to become Speaker in the wake of Gingrich's downfall, one of his strongest supporters was the man I had expected to seize the gavel: Tom DeLay.  DeLay, and other Republican leaders, likely realized that DeLay's style would be too controversial in the wake of the far less flamboyant Gingrich.  Hastert has been a quiet sort of leader, and it's easy to forget he's the Speaker, when he's so easily overshadowed by DeLay, Hyde and others on his side, and by Pelosi in the minority.  But we can see the DeLay in Hastert in full flower when he not only  urlLink  pretends not to know who John McCain is , but then segues into a disgusting tirade in which he questions McCain's patriotism:   If you want to see the sacrifice, John McCain ought to visit our young men and women at Walter Reed and Bethesda. There's the sacrifice in this country. We're trying to make sure they have the ability to fight this war, that they have the wherewithal to be able to do it. And, at the same time, we have to react to keep this country strong.   Few in the Senate have matched McCain for sheer hawkishness in the years since 9-11-01, and possibly no one in Congress has suffered as much as the hands of the enemy.  To turn McCain's criticism of the Republican party's dedication to deficit spending and its abandonment of traditional conservative principles of small-government and limited spending into an attack on McCain's commitment to the war is repulsive.  Hastert questions McCain's credentials as a Republican because he knows it is the only way to deflect attention away from the fact that pushing for  urlLink  ever-increasing budgets  while simultaneously slashing taxes can only result in a towering national debt and eventual bankruptcy.  There is nothing in this plan that is "conservative" by American standards.  Only by older, European Tory standards of massive imperial government can the Bush plan be seen as conservative.  Republican attacks like these are increasingly desperate, as they turn not only on heroic veterans like Max Cleland of Georgia, but on their own as well.  The Republicans have become a one-note party, in which every piece of their agenda is essential to defeating terrorism and in which anyone who stands in their way is somehow supporting the terrorists.  From Karen Hughes comparing  urlLink  abortion rights supporters to terrorists  all the way to Speaker Hastert's idiotic posturing on McCain Republicans simply can't find rational, decent and humane arguments for their policies, so they fall back on the same tired "fifth column" attacks of old.  And, worse yet, they still seem to work.  Perhaps, in a year when the Democratic nominee supports fiscal responsiblity, it's finally time for McCain to jump ship.  When the GOP turns its hairy, hunched back on one of its proudest and most patriotic members and then challenges his patriotism it is certainly time to go.

      Ben was kind enough to send me a copy of Christopher Hitchens's delightfully nasty book about Mother Teresa, with the even more delightfully nasty title  urlLink   The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice .   I'll be posting my thoughts on the book as I read it, which I suspect won't take long.  The level of academic stature it rises to is pretty much summed up by the fact that the largest critical blurb on the back cover is from John Waters, himself a bastion of fair and accurate discource, declaring the book "Hilariously Mean."  So, I'm not expecting Slavoj Zizek.  Although, I do wonder what Slavoj would think of her, come to think of it.  I already have a few minor quibbling critical points to make.  For one thing, where are the footnotes?  This isn't a huge problem for a number of reasons.  For one thing, as mentioned above, this isn't an academic text.  Polemics can be held to different standards.  Furthermore, all of his references are fairly well cited in-text, allowing us to hunt them down if we really want to.  Still, it would be nice to note the dates on which certain article appeared in newspapers, or on which networks broadcast certain television programs.  Then there are weird errors, which likely can be blamed on lazy editing, or lazy writing, or both.  On p. 8, Mo To (as I like to call her, rapper-style) arrives at "an eight-bed adoption facility" in DC.  By page 10 this has become a "new twelve-bed adoption centre."  Hitchens, or his editor, have magically added 50% more space for orphans in Chevy Chase.  Stil, I'm enjoying it.  I don't hate religion, or the religious, nearly as much as Hitchens and Tom Paine do, but I've never been amused by hagiography, and everything about her is so hagiographic.  "Mother Teresa, you're so magnificent and selfless!  Can I wash your vagina?"  Also, I think Hitchens is really trying to get at a bigger point (which I'll discuss more later, if he gets to it, or if he doesn't) which is that Mother Teresa can be seen as a sign for all of religious activity -- in which religions quickly cease to be radical and quickly become part of the establishment, and that "charity" is just a way of keeping the poor in their place.  Case in point:  "I think it is very beautiful for the poor to aceept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ.  I think the world is being very much helped by the suffering of the poor."  That is Mother Teresa, from a poorly cited interview.  I'll check back in with more thoughts, including a possible Nietzschean reading of that quote, later.  Right now, I have some vaginas to wash.

      Ben has  urlLink pointed out   that O'Reilly still denies he's a conservative, contrary to my eliptical assertion otherwise. What I meant was not that O'Reilly has become more open about his politics, but that we all know anyway.  He's the Kevin Spacey of the Beltway.  That is, everyone else in America refers to him as "conservative talk-show host O'Reilly."  When I speak of him, of course, I try to fit in the words "douchebag," and "fuckchops."

      Nothing -- so so sayeth Oregon and Portland voters.  With the primary election results mostly in, Jim Francesconi's million dollar campaign couldn't even buy him a plurality of votes.  He'll be heading into a runoff with former police chief Tom Potter as the underdog.  And not once has Portland chosen the second place winner in November.  Potter finished a few points ahead of Francesconi, while raising just over $60,000 dollars, about six percent of what Francesconi raised and spent.  Potter voluntarily limited contributions to $25 and has made a strong case that grass roots progressive political action can have major impact at the municipal level.  Potter's plurality comes, of course, on the heels of a series of deadly police shootings.  Potter has the experience with police issues, and the dedication to community policing, that the people of Portland may finally be demanding, after too many years of Vera Katz doing too little too late.  Now, to solidify his position he will need to broaden his base away from progressive voters, who were likely more prevalent yesterday as they cast their votes of both Kucinich and Kerry.  Speaking of which, Kucinich spent a full month campaigning in Oregon and ending up with 16% yesterday.  Not a bad showing in a race in which the winner has already been chosen.  But still, not as good as many post-Nader progressive might have hoped for.  In other political news -- Katz's former chief-of-staff Sam Adams finishes ten points behind Nick Fish to force a run-off in November.  Adams has a tendency to look like a bit demon who hungers to devour your soul through your asshole, but he has experience and isn't an East Coast Republican, so that is good.  I prefer Adams to Fish, but not because we're both gay.  Afterall, Fish lists Barney Frank as one of his political mentors.  Ewwwww.  Besides, I love Sam Adams beer.  If the name is good enough for the Brewer Patriot, it's good enough for the City Commission.  Randy Leonard, a City Commissioner I endorsed when he ran last year, or whenever it was, and who I now have mixed feelings on, has also been re-elected, despite an entire of gang of pro-business candidates opposing him.  Leonard has been autocratic and a little nutty, but he's also come down on the right side on more issues than not, so I'm glad he'll be remaining where he is.  Goli Ameri, a beautiful and intelligent Persian-American, won the Republican primary to face the somewhat clueless David Wu in the 1st Congressional district.  Ameri would become the first Iranian American Congresswoman, as Wu is the first Chinese America congressman.  I still urge voters in the 1st to stick with Wu, but only because he's a Democrat.  In a perfect world in which the Republican leadership wasn't one big douchebag I might feel differently.  And speaking of douches . . .  urlLink  Lyndon LaRouche  took about 2.5 perfect in the presidential primary, proving that  urlLink  crazy fascists  who believe  urlLink  Queen Elizabeth was behind the OKC bombing  and are linked to the  urlLink  mysterious deaths of young Jews  are always popular in times of war.

      A funny quote from JR Pella's review of  Troy  in the Willamette Week :   Seriously, fucking up Homer is equivalent to burning microwave popcorn--the story is already there, all that needs to be done is to the follow the instructions! . . . The sole purpose for the supporting cast--other than to prove that people in ancient Greece walked around talking in Irish brogues and faux hexameter--is to move along the pesky plot.   Funny as it is, I still disagree.  I've not seen  Troy , but I'm not sold that turning Homer into film is so easy.  Particularly when American epic cinema has lost all its poetry.  Homer is more than just shiny armor and fake tans, afterall.  I'd encourage you to read the rest of this review, but you can't, as the   WW   has bothered to update their dumb website.  Boo.

      From a Cannes panel headed by  urlLink  Roger Ebert :   [Moore] lambasted "a climate of political repression" in the United States. Well, everybody expected that from Moore. It was a little startling, though, when fellow panelist Jonathan Nossiter drew parallels between the world's wine industry and the Bush administration. Nossiter is here with "Mondovino," a documentary in the official competition that charges the wine establishment with abandoning its long-held values and ethics to move toward compromises and secrecy. The great vineyards are run behind a curtain of secrecy like the White House, he said, with loyalty valued above all.   I'm guessing Nossiter's movie is so boring he's hoping that association with the Idiot Man-Child of the Left with help him find a distributor.  I'm not going to write much about Moore's movie until I see it, but for a nice run down of criticism, and various snarky additions, go see  urlLink  Ben .

      Charles Larson, at Salon, makes a somewhat strained comparison between Bush and Kurtz:  urlLink  "Exterminate all the brutes."   I think Larson goes too far in saying that Iraq is more analogous to the Africa of Conrad's novel than Vietnam was (his proof is mostly factual, as in trading in ivory for oil, and not thematic, which misses the point that  Heart of Darkness  is all theme and no fact).  Still, the power of Conrad's novel is that, even a century after it appeared it continues stir in us the full horror of evangelical war and to help us see the heart of darkness in all of us.

      When will David Brock decide to shut up?  This is  the  question plaguing America today.  Brock, who made his name as the right-wing attack dog who savaged Anita Hill so effectively, is now trying to remake his name as a Leftist critic of the Right.  I'm not exactly sure how he had such a sudden conversion, and frankly I don't care. What I do know is that he really needs to shut his mouth already.  Brock's book  Blinded By The Right  chronicled his epiphany and was essentially his admission to all the great evils he committed.  Okay, fine.  I mean, I think it's a little hard to trust anything an admitted liar-for-hire has to say about his old bosses, which as Laura Kipnis  urlLink  points out  at Slate, began shortly after his book on Hillary Clinton failed to inspire the Right in quite the same way as the book on Hill.  Still,   Blinded  is a worthwhile book, and gives some insights into the way the Right-wing smear-machine works.  Of course, it ignores the fact that Clinton had his own smear-tacticians (the aide assigned to "bimbo-patrol" in 1992, for instance) or the fact that although Right-wingers did, indeed, make up lies and distort Clinton's record that doesn't excuse the fact that he was a grade-A double-shot liar himself.  But what do we expect?  Brock is like a fish with one eye -- he can only look in one direction.  At the moment, that eye is fixed to the Right, hunting out the misdeeds in his old school, while his new school swarms and feeds with abandon.  Brock has a new book out now, called  The Republican Noise Machine .  Excerpts of this book can be found at Salon.   urlLink  Here  and  urlLink  here , oh yeah and an  urlLink  interview .  Brock might have no career at all if not for Salon.  These excerpts and interviews are so poorly written and funny that I can't even talk about them.  Read at your own risk, and be prepared for Brock's pious declaration that NPR and the New York Times are "fair and accurate."  Which brings me to Brock's super-lame, and very poorly formatted, new website:  urlLink  Media Matters For America .  First we must ask ourselves this question: "Why does this title suck so much?"  then we must answer it: "Oh yeah, this is David Brock's new site."  This is a "Web-based, not-for-profit progressive research and information center dedicated to comprehensively monitoring, analyzing, and correcting conservative misinformation in the U.S. media."  Yes, it is comprehensive all right.  Of 41 items posted on the site's front page, a full 19 are about Rush Limbaugh -- and all are about the same thing, Limbaugh's support for torture.  The fact is, they aren't correcting any misinformation from Limbaugh, just pointing out that he says disgusting and horrifying things. About 10 others are on Michael Savage saying disgusting and outrageous things.  The rest are an assortment of Sean Hannity and Bill Kristol quotes.  Which leaves me a little perplexed.  Afterall, Right-wing distortions matter when they invade our homes in forms we can't see, or can't see clearly.  For several years very few Americans knew Bill O'Reilly was a die-hard conservative because he lied about it all the time.  That was scary.  But we outted Bill, and now he's living his conservative life very happily.  But come on, who listens to Rush and doesn't realize he is a Right-wing zealot?  You may believe what he says, or you may realize he's full of shit, but there is no question of where he stands.  Michael Savage is an even easier target.  Bill Kristol, although possessed of the wit and intelligence that Limbaugh and Savage lack, is also a bold and proud conservative.  Kristol is perhaps the only one that is listened to by liberals as well as conservatives, because he alone has the credibility to maintain a broad audience.  But Brock doesn't care.  He's not looking for a broad audience for himself anyway.  He's looking for a few wealthy limo-liberals to pony up some cash to keep his "web-based media center" running and his wallet full.  In order to do this, Brock uses his instinctual skill at finding the people (not issues) that most rile up his base.  And so we have Limbaugh, Limbaugh, Limbaugh, Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, Savage, Limbaugh and a little more Limbaugh.  He also mentions himself, a lot.  His name probably appears as often as Rush's.  Brock is the cheapest media whore of them all.  Brock's  urlLink  letter to readers  is particularly narcissistic and reveals that Brock's entire career exists only because he is an "ex-conservative."  Ex-conservatives, I imagine, are a bit like ex-gays.  In order to maintain his new, inorganic role in life, he must constantly talk about his conversion experience.  The moment of Brock's Redemption from the Right has become his sole purpose for existing.  And so, he keeps pushing his autobiography down our throats.  We get it already, David.  You were a asshole.  Now you're not.  Oh wait, yes you are.  I imagine that if every liberal in America stopped listening to him, he'd throw another drama queen hissy fit, apologize to Rush, and convert again.  We can only hope.  Brock is only good at two things: smearing his enemies, and marketing himself.  "Media Matters for America," though, has the desperate stench of a whore long past her prime still hawking it on the corner.  David, go home already, you tired old queen.

      Now i've been pegged (and not in a  urlLink  sexy way ) by Ben as a  urlLink  humorless, knee-jerk Kerryite .  I wish to make it clear once and for all that I don't mind criticism of the candidate.  There is nothing at all wrong with pushing him to clarify his message or in trying to voice our ideas of what that message should be.  What I don't care for are the hysterical ravings of Corky Cassandras who are convinced he will lose and that he has no message.  This "Kerryism" business is kind of amusing -- although the structure of the piece is too David Foster Wallace for my tastes.  Also, heads up to Ben for pointing out the fantastically brilliant  urlLink  Washingtonienne .  Working for the Senate staff has never seemed so Bret Easton Ellis.  Shit, dudes, I just used two authors' names as adjectives.  I am retarded.

      Tim Noah, of Slate's  urlLink  Chatterbox  writes:   "Read my lips" is funny—unless, of course, it's spoken to a deaf person—and swagger always comes across better when it's leavened with humor. "Make no mistake," on the other hand, are the words not merely of a bully, but of a bully who lacks panache.   I couldn't agree more.  I always thought that Bush would be fun to hang around with at my uncle's barbeque or something.  But when I actually think about it, I'm not so sure.  If Bush weren't an ex-drunk we'd be set.  But alas, he is.  And like so many of those who go dry, the President just isn't what he used to be.  The thing that is most grating about Bush's style is his complete lack of humor.  It's not so much that what he's saying is pompous, arrogant and devoid of anything vaguely resembling coherence and nuance, it's that he can't even give us a charming Ronald Reagan-esque smile, or speak with the kind of sharp-edged irony that his father displayed under the keen guidance of Peggy Noonan.  What was wrong with Bush's much-derided joke about "searching for WMD" in the East Wing of the White House wasn't that it was offensive, it was that it just wasn't that funny.  It was like a skit from  Saturday Night Live  that was so bad they couldn't even convince Chris Farley to do it.  In so many ways, George W. Bush is the political equivalent of Tom Cruise -- an actor that we may remember as having been funny in  Jerry Maguire , until we watch it again and realize that he's got no rhythm and even the funniest jokes sound forced and dry in his mouth.  Perhaps Bush once was funny, but he is like a child at the grown-ups' table for Thanksgiving, trying desperately not to look like a silly little kid.  Or perhaps he was never funny, and I just wish he could be so that I could say "I like the guy just fine, it's his  policies  I can't stand."  Well, I don't like the guy just fine.  At least some of his policies are funny.

      Yes, indeed, I do.  I especially love in the witty form of Ann Romano, whose  urlLink   One Day At A Time   in the Portland Mercury (and also, I think, the Stranger in Seattle), is the greatest thing to happen to celebrity gossip since Joan Rivers lost her face.  Brilliant quote of the week:   On his website, Moore cites a New York Times story that reports Disney chief Michael Eisner didn't want to release a film that's critical of Florida governor Jeb Bush's presidential brother, thereby "endangering" the millions in tax breaks granted annually to Disney's theme parks. "I would have hoped by now that I would be able to put my work out to the public," complains Moore, "without having to experience profound censorship." But, despite Moore's incessant belly-aching, Fahrenheit 9/11 will undoubtedly be picked up by any distributor interested in the piles of money Moore made from his successful Oscar-winning work, Bowling for Columbine (which has been so "profoundly censored," one can only find it in the "Whiny Lefty Politics" section of your local video store).    and runner-up:   Did Ross and Rachel finally reunite? Answer: YES--but not in time to save David Schwimmer's acting career or stop the aging Jennifer Aniston from looking like a horse.

      I have supported Senator Kerry for a long time, and am glad to see him poised to become President.  I am also sad that so many people who should be supporting him are spending all their effort being mean to my boy.  Not only is Mickey Kaus trying to prove that Kerry should be dumped before (or during) the Convention, and that all the Democratic elites are "panicking" over him, but now Tim has posted this  urlLink  inflammatory statement of apathy  (and an especially flattering photo of Kerry to go with it).  Frankly, I'm getting very sick and tired of the "Kerry has no message" line.  There is some truth to this statement of course, but it's still a steaming pile of maggot-infested, yet surprisingly fresh and tasty, horsecrap!  Kerry has many messages, as can be found with  urlLink  only a little bit of effort  on the part of you, fair voter.  God forbid that a candidate should have nuanced positions on a wide range of issues.  No, no.  Senator Kerry is expected to hand you a nicely wrapped message on a silver tray with a pretty pink bow.  Oh sure, most effective messages are simple.  "It's the economy, Stupid!" worked wonders in 1992.  But come on, people, can't we for one solitary minute enjoy having a candidate who isn't so neatly packaged?  He will package himself very well by the Convention and will peel through Aug-Sept-Oct and win on the first tuesday in November in the usual, strong-finisher Kerry fashion.  Even if he HAD a strong, easy-to-read, kindergarten level message for you all to eat up like dogs at a vomit-trough, it wouldn't do him any good.  It's too early.  Oh much is being made of the fact that his numbers don't bump up even when Bush's fall.  So what?  No one is paying attention yet.  Just those of us with nothing better to do, really, sitting around bemoaning the fate of the free world while refusing to pony up a little cash to help save that world.  Also, let us reflect on this:  Kerry has been through a grueling primary race that everyone was certain he would lose.  In order to win that race, he had to use certain tactics that are now of little use to him.  He must reposition himself, as all candidates who emerge from nasty primaries must.  This takes time.  Bush has had no primary, and has had the two and a half years since Sept 11, 2001 to refine his message.  It is a simple one, gloriously so: "If you don't vote for me, you will die."  Bush has the advantage for now, but we will never succeed in wresting it away from his contorted, silent-movie-moustache-waxing-villain claws if we just sit around and whine about how we wish Howard "Midget Bush" Dean had been given the nomination, or how wonderful it would be if the Convention erupted in orgasms and rejected Kerry in favor of pretty-boy Edwards, or lumbering hulk Michael Moore, or the sprightly leprechaun we call Kucinich.  Or, of course, we could all just fall to our knees and lick Nader's crazy-eye, and hand Bush the presidency again.  Or, we can, you know, be serious voting adults about it and support the man who will not only beat Bush in November but may flourish into one of the great presidents of our new century.  ps: Tim, this is not a personal attack on you.  Okay, well, not  just  you.  I'm angry at Mickey Kaus too.  And you deserve it anyway.

      In the waning days of the Clinton Administration, we were treated to endless paeans from gay activists on how Clinton had been the greatest president for gays in American History.  Possibly true, I suppose, considering that few other presidents gave much thought to gays, and those who did (like Reagan) were virulently homophobic in practice.  Still, I think the Gay Rights Movement as manifested in vaguely liberal wishy-washy mainstream organizations like  urlLink  The Human Rights Campaign  may be the most blind or stupid movement in American civil rights history.  A few of Clinton's achievements on gay rights:  1. Don't Ask/Don't Tell: Clinton turns pansy on his promise to lift the ban on gays in our armed forces by creating this "solution" which is worse than the problem he sought to solve.  Now, not only is gay sex illegal in the forces, but so is any mention of your orientation or proclivities to anyone at all.  This new policy led to  urlLink  increasingly large  numbers of discharges throughout Clinton's Administration.  2. Signed the Defense of Marriage Act -- a blatantly unconstitutional law, passed at a time when gay marriage was still likely many years in the future, with the sole intent of writing discrimination directly into Federal law.  3.  urlLink Appoints James Hormel  and two other gays to substantial government office.  Hormel is the most high profile, a high-paying campaign donor of Chili fame, nominated to head up our extremely important delegation to Luxembourg.  (this link has an inappropriate reference to "potential closeted lesbians" of high rank -- the reference is clearly to Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and to Attorney General Janet Reno.  Say what you will about either of those women, but any woman in high office who has no husband is always accused of being a lesbo, Condi included)  4. Bans discrimination in civilian federal hiring practices -- this is a real achievement, and I will give him credit when it's due.  But the fact is that firing based on sexual orientation in the civilian government workforce was never as severe as it was in the military -- and on that front, Clinton exacerbated the problem.  Now, let us compare to Bush:  1. Leaves in place Clinton's military policy 2. Leaves in place Clinton's ban on workplace discrimination 3. Appoints  urlLink  dozens  of gays to offices, including the head of National AIDS Policy, a move which enraged his supporters on the Right. 4. Endorses the Federal Marriage Amendment  It is only with the recent advent of No. 4 -- which I actually thought Bush wouldn't do, that he eclipses Clinton as the more homophobic of our two most recent presidents.  Before that, a strong argument could be made that Bush was actually BETTER for gays than Clinton.  Andrew Sullivan carried  urlLink  this link  today about Bush's AIDS policy, so I'll just refer you on.  It is from the New York Times, which requires you to register.  It's not much trouble, and is well worth it.  Of course, gay rights groups don't want to talk about it.  We sneer at the  urlLink  Log Cabin Republicans  and bemoan the loss of the White House.  We have built a myth out of Clinton's tenure that is untenable.  Until we are willing to confront the reality of Clinton's legacy on gays, and of Bush's, we will forever be unable to become an effective political voice.  Democrats now see that they can take us for granted without giving us any reason to support them.  When the best thing the Democratic Party as a whole (minus a few brave souls like House minority leader Nancy Pelosi) can say is "Well, we don't hate you enough to pass an Amendment codifying our hatred of you . . ," we have a serious problem, don't we?  If real change comes in this country, it will likely come from a volatile and vocal uprising of queers within the Democratic Party or from the Log Cabin Republicans, Andrew Sullivan and other gays on the Right.  HRC, NGLTF and all the other mainstream, namby-pamby white-picket-fence gay groups simply have no credibility and no spine.

      Before I begin this little spiel, I suppose I have to go on record saying that I unequivocally support the rights of all people to marry as they see fit.  That being said, there is something vaguely creepy and a little bit sad to me about the gay marriage movement.  I am happy for those who can now express their love legally.  That's all well and good, and I would not think to take it away from them.  But there are still a few things troubling me.  For one thing, I can't help but think of this as a step BACK.  It's not a progressive action in any sense of that word.  Marriage is an ancient tradition which has existed in many forms throughout human history.  In virtually all of those forms it has been rooted in the oppression of one or more of the partners.  "The family," in whatever form it takes, is part of the fabric that holds together a community.  To disrupt the values of that community, disrupting the family is a good place to start.  Gay marriage disrupts nothing.  It is a tacit admission by the "gay community" (whatever the hell that is, anyway) that long-term, civil and religious monogamy, preferably with children, is the right, true and proper way to be in love.  It is also an admission that the government has the right to tell us that some love is legitimate and that some other is not.  Remember when Senator Santorum spoke out against sodomy, enraging every queer in America, including Dan Savage who soon applied the Senator's name to  urlLink  the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex" ?  Well, Senator Santorum richly deserved this appellation, but it wasn't for the reasons so often stated.  It wasn't because he compared gay sex to promiscuity, polygamy and prostitution.  It was because he compared us to pedophiles and people who have sex with animals.  None of the gay organizations focus on that, it is only on this portion of his statement:   "If the Supreme Court says that you have a right to consensual sex within your home, then you have the right to bigamy, you have the right to polygamy, you have the right to incest, you have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything."   He is absolutely right that gay sex and gay marriage can and should be compared to multiple-marriage and prostitution, adultery, incest and all the rest: that is if we want gay marriage actually to be progressive.  Of course, we don't.  The audible gasps greeting Santorum's pronouncement reflect on the fact that Andrew Sullivan has won, and even "liberal gays" are really as conservative as the Family Values Right of James Dobson, et al.  The issue is not whether gays should be allowed to marry; the issue is whether the state has any right at all to regulate our love and our sexuality.  Why is there such an institution as civil marriage at all?  Why can I not bestow the "rights" inherent in marriage (that is, power of attorney, medical guardianship, inheritance rights) on whoever the fuck I please?  And how exactly does increasing the regulation of marriage to include another "privileged" set at the expense of untold other still unprivileged sets (those who have multiple partners, those with no partners, etc) help anything?  I am not, generally speaking, opposed to regulation.  But I am opposed to the state regulating my personal life, in any way.  I don't need the Supreme Court or Congress or the Multnomah County Commission to tell me that my relationships are or are not legitimate based on their arbitrary, conservative and hypocritical standards.  The most profoundly meaningful and progressive thing all of us, gay and straight, can now do is  refuse to get married!   Stay single, become "partners" or get married in your church, but do not head down to the License Bureaus and pay the government your hard earned money so that they can condescendingly approve of your relationship.  Fuck the Gay Marriage Movement.  It's time for a No Marriage Movement.

      This post title has nothing to do with what I am about to write, but it made me laugh in my head when I thought of it one second ago, so, voila, as the dirty Frenchmen say in their lispy French voices.  I don't actually know what the French sound like.  The only one I've ever known was too busy deep throating me to talk.  That is also a lie.  Or is it?  Not to equate someone I really only know from sporadic e-mail debates with homosexual foreigners giving me BJ's or anything, but since he was kind enough to link to my blog, I figure you should all go see Tim's new blog.

      I am not going to pretend that I actually read  urlLink  National Review Online .  To be honest, I only go when it is linked to by either  urlLink Sully  or Mickey Kaus's  urlLink  kausfiles .  Mickey linked me over to read Jonah Goldberg's column attacking  60 Minutes II 's decision to air the Iraqi prisoner photos.  In fairness to Jonah, who is not nearly so clueless as I'm about to make him out to be, please go read his article,  urlLink  here .  The quote that's most important for his purposes, and my own, is this:   Lost is the fact that in America torturers get punished, while in the Arab world they get promotions. Huge percentages of Arabs are illiterate, which means these pictures will tell the whole story, particularly in the hands of the vilely anti-American Arab media. This will harden hearts against us and almost certainly result in lost American and Iraqi lives.  To an extent, Goldberg is right.  The publication has already led to lost lives.  The "justification" for Nick Berg's violent assassination was the abuse at Abu Ghraib.  Of course, to actually blame Berg's death on the publication of the photos misses two essential points.  The first is that the photos themselves  aren't that important.  They are disturbing and enraging, yes.  But does Jonah really think that the "viley anti-American Arab media" care about the photos themselves?  Or is it perhaps the actual  abuse  that stokes their anger?  And do they need pictures to prove it, or would words suffice?  The more important point is that terrorists like Zarqawi don't need any excuses to kill people, American or otherwise.  This may be a convenience for them, but let us all pause and reflect for a moment on the fact that killing people for no discernible reason is what al Qaeda does best.  There is something even greater at stake, though.  The future of democracy hangs on such issues as this scandal.  You may think I overstate, and maybe I do, but not by much.  Democracy is not just a political system in which people vote for their leaders.  It is a philosophical construct of values that give meaning and purpose to our entire cultural system.  One of those values, perhaps the most vital of them, is transparency and accountability.  What good is voting for leaders if they then escape into a vaccuum where we cannot touch them?  It was this insistence on accountability and openness that made the best argument for the impeachment of President Clinton, and conservatives shouldn't be so willy-nilly in throwing it away.  We have no evidence that Goldberg is right in asserting that in America torturers get punished.  Certainly some will be punished now, because of the publication of the photos.  But considering the schizophrenic reaction within the Pentagon and the possibility (which I have publicly doubted on this very blog) that the abuse was orchestrated by people much higher up than Lynndie England, how do we know that any punishment would have come?  It would be best for us to act quickly and release  all  photographic evidence immediately.  Why?  Because it may be our only way of proving to the people of Iraq, and throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds, that American democracy works.  That when things go wrong, we actually do something.  Keeping them secret may not exactly be a cover-up, but it will undoubtedly lead to countless conspiracy theories at home and abroad which will fuel more rage than honesty possible could.  Maybe releasing these photos has, and will, cause many lives to be lost.  Democracy is not always pretty; it is not always safe.  But to sacrifice one of the greatest aspects of democracy to the terrorists just to keep them from killing us (remember, folks, they don't need any reason to kill us) is both cowardly and futile.  Jonah Goldberg sees Iraqis as dangerous leopards who must be kept at bay by any mean necessary.  He is wholly uninterested in establishing democracy in the Middle East or in protecting the American system.  The invasion and occupation of Iraq was not to liberate anyone, but to cage the wild beasts before they can kill.  I never thought Bush was all that concerned with his promise that the end of Saddam's reign would give Iraqis a chance to forge their own future, and I am certain the Jonah isn't.  I agree with Mickey Kaus that we should get out of Iraq soon, turning the government over to Iraqis, and leaving as small a force of international peacekeepers on the ground as possible for the sake of stability.  Still, I'm not surprised that Kaus would advocate both early elections and support Goldberg's defense of secrecy in government.  Kaus also sees Iraqis as leopards, but unlike Goldberg he is unwilling to keep them caged, and would rather run as far as he can.  But we cannot run, Mickey.  And we cannot hide, Jonah.  Our only option is to stand at fight back with the only weapons we have: democracy, accountability and transparency.

      It does not surprise me that conservative culture warriors choose to blame things like Abu Ghraib on women in the military or pornography or whatever else they can.  It is part of the pathology in which supporters of war refuse to admit that war has any bad consequences.  The theory goes thus: Americans love porn, therefore when Americans torture prisoners in a field of war and record their exploits it is because our culture accepts pornography.  So, even if this is true, it misses the whole goddamn point!  It buys into the notion that the torture itself wasn't so bad, it was the RECORDING that these MP's should be ashamed of.  Of course, it's not true.  Torturers throughout history have documented their exploits in writing, photography and film.  When we uncover serial killers' ghastly back-yard sheds of skin and livers and then find their diaries exulting in their conquests, it is not porno they are writing, it is simply a record.  Showing how powerful you are, destroying your enemies and reducing them to animals, really is no fun if no one gets to KNOW ABOUT IT!  In a sense, it is pornography.  But that is not to say that American culture (which is not as pro-porn as these porno-will-make-you-torture-Iraqi-prisoners defense think it is) is to blame.  At least not American sexual libertine culture.  I'd rather blame American military culture.  Then of course, they use this unrelated story to back things up:  urlLink  "Sick Romps at Porny Prison" .  The problem?  Just as torture has always been a part of war, so has sex.  With a sexually integrated military, this just changes the dynamic.  Sometimes not by much (as with sexual abuse allegations by female soldiers and cadets against their male colleagues attest) -- but perhaps sometimes they do.  Who cares if a female MP was engaged in a gang bang at Abu Ghraib?  Isn't' that, really, her business?  Hers and the fifteen men she was screwing?  No, of course not.  Afterall, only women who like to be slammed by a dozen men at a time would ever think of torturing someone.  And of course the evidence is plain that they are already sick and probably criminal.  At least, in this case, she was apparently engaged in consensual sex acts.  This is far better than the soldiers dropping into Baghdad to take some from whoever they can find.  War is a nasty beast.  If you choose to ride it, be prepared to nurse its babies: torture, rape and the general breakdown of normal moral standards.

      This post also features news that's a few days past its prime.  In my defense, I did write about this earlier, only to have the website freak out and destroy my posting.  It was a little longer, but mostly boring, so I won't try to recreate it.  Portland has lost its resident Howard Stern wannabe, Marconi.  Or rather, Marconi has lost Portland.  After years of crude, crass and childishly funny radio talkshow blather, Marconi crossed the line by  urlLink  airing the death screams  of Nick Berg while making insensitive jokes over it, and was summarily fired.  I'm not sure this surprises me.  In a way, it does.  Marconi is not always the most intelligent of radio hosts.  He lacks the polished, nuanced comedic talents of Howard Stern. And yet, somehow, I always found him more humane.  He had a clear love for those he interviewed, even when he condescended to them.  Like John Waters, Marconi had a sensibility in which all things can be laughed at, and in which laughing at someone is not so much cruel as it is loving and admirable.  I don't want to stroke his ego too much, and I've already crossed into hyperbole by comparing him to one of the great provocative artists of our time, but what I meant to point out is that despite the frat-house jokes about mayonnaise, bacon, strippers and yam-bags, Marconi seemed to be a decent person.  The apology on  urlLink his website  seems lame, trite and insincere (and features appalling grammar and the delightfully Freudian "please except my apology," as well as some spectacularly inappropriate capitalization), and perhaps I was wrong about how decent he was.  Instead of using humor as a way to make the horrors of this world manageable, he has used it as a way to make them even more horrific.  And unlike Neil Goldschmidt, Marconi has done nothing with his career that can even begin to mitigate his downfall.  Although I have refused to listen to Marconi since he move to mornings disrupted my morning rides home and pushed the brilliant, clever and sexy  urlLink Daria  to another, lame-ass, radio-sation, I still feel a little sad that there will no longer be gleefully immature humor filling our airwaves.  Marconi, like most of his ilk, feared the FCC. But in the end he had only his own antisocial persona to blame for his demise.

      I admit that I'm a little slow on the uptake, and this story technically broke before I started this blog, but I have just gotten around to reading the  Willamette Week 's  urlLink  cover story   on former Oregon Governor Neil Goldschmidt's sexual relationship with a fourteen year old girl beginning in 1975.  The article begins on the very cover of the newspaper, and this blaring uber-headline ends with the sentence, "But it is clear that today, on her 43rd birthday, living a thousand miles from her friends and family in Portland, she is a haunted woman."  The implication is that she has fled Portland to hide from Goldschmidt, that she has no friends and family where she is, and that Goldschmidt's abuse is at the center of her haunting.  I have no doubt that being victimized by a much older man had a terrible impact on this woman's life and is at least part of the reason that so much in her life went awry.  But the implications left so early on are at least partially false.  She has a family in Nevada (where she now lives) including a husband and a stepdaughter.  She was sexually abused by a family member (her cousin points to the grandfather as the culprit), before or during her relationship with Goldschmidt.  How much of a role did his actions play in her development?  I don't know, and likely nor does she.  Later in her life, she was kidnapped and brutally raped, left in worse shape than any other victim the judge in this case had ever seen.  Certainly her past history of sexual abuse, by at least two people, greatly effected her reaction to this final, horrible crime.  And certainly this final crime has led in its own way to a great deal of the pain she now feels.  But of course, the   WW   buries most of this near the bottom of the article, which uses a compare/contrast style to show how her descent into a more and more chaotic and unstable world mirrored Goldschmidt's rapid rise from brilliant young mayor to Cabinet member to Nike executive, to Governor and beyond.  Stylistically, the piece is certainly effective.  It has the kind of grand, spectacular tragic arc we expect from Tolstoy or Flaubert, or perhaps from Goethe's   Faust  .  I'm just not convinced that it paints an accurate portrayal of either character's life.  Goldschmidt's apology seemed genuinely heartfelt, and I happen to believe him when he admits to the deep horror and guilt he feels over his actions.  That does not mean that I excuse them, or "understand" them, but simply that I think he has struggled to come to terms with what kind of a person he is, that he could do this to a young woman.  I also don't know how far I buy the   WW  's assertion, without a great deal to back it up, that this event is at the center of the now middle-aged woman's psyche.  She refused to admit the nature of their relationship to the reporters, so how much could they have learned?  The fact that her hands shook so badly she couldn't light her cigarette is meant to convey her subliminal pain and fear at the mere mention of his name, but we also know she takes anticonvulsant medications and has suffered seizures -- so could the shaking hands not also simply signify a physical disorder, or a general psychiatric problem?  Another question that I thought of during my time reading this article was the question of vocabulary.  What do we call what Goldschmidt did?  It was, by all accounts, "consensual," and yet certainly violated the law's definition thereof.  Did he "molest" her, did he "rape" her, did he "take advantage" of her?  What exactly did he do?  I'm not sure that any word works that easily, though consensual or not he certainly victimized her.  Legally, he raped her.  But then I imagine when I was 14 or 15 and had an English teacher who I thought was the most amazingly good looking man I'd ever seen.  As an intelligent teenager I thought of myself as easily this man's equal, and imagined us having a healthy, normal relationship.  It didn't matter that he was in his 30s.  If he'd wanted to have sex with me, I'd have gone along.  And I'd be pretty f'ed up these days, I'm sure.  Perhaps more when I realized that he did not see us as having a mutual or equal relationship and that all he wanted was sex and not long, drawn-out conversations on Faulkner, than by the sex itself.  I cannot speak for her, or any other victims of this type of sexual abuse, but I can empathize both with their own actions and the pain and conflict that comes after.  I wish this woman all the best in her life, but I leave it up to her to decide whether or not Goldschmidt deserves hatred or forgiveness.  Goldschmidt committed a grave crime, and were it not long after the statute of limitations has run out, he would deserve whatever punishment came his way.  But I am left with a lingering, dirty feeling after reading this article.  How much about this woman did we need to know?  Did we need to know about her medications, her repeated job losses, her run-ins with the law, her drinking habits?  They do not identify her by name, and that is good, but still.  They wanted a good story of a woman torn apart by her affair with the mayor, and they succeeded.  But I think that she may still be the victim of this story, which does little to shed light on Goldschmidt's actions, or on its effect on his legacy as one of the great figures of Oregon history, and does nothing to put her fears and demons to rest.  And then, what of his legacy?  How does this, and how should this, change that?  This is a less thorny problem.  Perhaps because so much of Goldschmidt's towering achievements occurred during his stint as Mayor of Portland, which coincided with the abuse, but is also 30 years history to us now.  It is also easier because of how profoundly he impacted, almost entirely for the better, the city of Portland and the state of Oregon.  He was at the vanguard of the movement to install innovative transportation solutions (such as the light rail), to create a thriving down town around Pioneer Courthouse Square, to block the proposed interstate highway through Southeast Portland to Mount Hood and too many other things for me to bother typing about.  He was, perhaps, too smart for his own good.  Like so many great figures, real and imagined, his hubris led him to believe he could do anything, that our moral codes don't apply to his actions.  He was wrong, and in the end his career, which had just been reawakened by the election of his protege, Ted Kulongoski, to the governor's office, will be remembered as one that began with great success and ended in terrible shame.

      With the eruption of insincere and naive "shock" over the revelations of torture and humiliation, sexual and otherwise, at Abu Ghraib, a great deal of discussion has focused on the sexual nature of much of the humiliation and on who may or may not have ordered these practices.  The debate is muddled by a number of factors, not least of all the political necessity of pretending such abuses are aberrant and somehow outside the morality of war.  Of course, President Bush has not expressed any shock or outrage over the deaths of innocent children in Baghdad during the conquest last year.  That, apparently, was moral and justifiable (if slightly unsavory), but the humiliation of captives is somehow beyond the pale.  This is not intended to justify the actions of those who abused prisoners. Although trying to civilize the least civilized of human urges is probably futile, it still must be done.  A democracy requires transparency of actions and public accountability and demands the rule of law.  All those who participated in such acts should be punished and it is essential that we uncover just how far up this conspiracy to stretch the Geneva Convention to its boundaries and beyond goes.  However, I think something needs to be said about one of the least intelligible arguments being bandied about these days.  Was the sexual humiliation of these prisoners designed specifically to violate the sensibilities of Muslim men?  And if so, does that prove that superiors gave the orders?  The answer to both questions is no.  Although this is now a favorite of opinion-makers around the globe it fails to make sense to me.  Susan Collins, the moderate and generally insightful Senator from Maine, made this a key part of her questioning of General Taguba and Undersecretary Cambone on the Taguba Report.  The problem with this argument is obvious.  The sexual humiliation in question includes forcing men to masturbate in front of other people and pose for photographs that would make it appear they were engaged in homosexual acts.  Certainly this would disturb and offend any Muslim man.  But the assumption here is that this would be   especially   disturbing to a Muslim, and that American soldiers would need to be told this in order to do it.  Therefore, according to this logic, it would be impossible for mainstream American Christian heterosexuals to imagine being humiliated by public masturbation and mock homosexual acts.  Unfortunately, evangelical Christians, Catholics, mainstream Protestants, Orthodox Jews and even most secular American men have nearly as strong a revulsion for man-on-man action as any Muslim.  If the soldiers were acting on their own and had to think up things that would be excruciatingly humiliating, is it so difficult to imagine that they'd pick exactly these things?  We like to imagine that the Judaeo-Christian culture of America is vastly different in its moral fabric than that of Islamic Arab culture, but in fact it is not, particularly as regards the disgust men feel toward homosexuals.  But even if this    were   designed especially for Muslims, it still wouldn't show that superiors were involved.  Our media culture is saturated with images of Muslim men as it has never been, and the overwhelming focus from coverage of the Taliban to criticisms of Saudi Arabia have been the misogynistic man who defends his hyper-masculinity with violence against all challenges.  Certainly our soldiers cannot be unaware of the sex and gender issues that are so pervasive in Arab culture, or at least of the exaggerated mediated image of those issues.  They could easily come up with this stuff on their own.  Perhaps especially the female soldiers, who are certainly aware of the effect their presence has in Iraq.  And now, of course, we have differing testimonies on this issue.  Lynndie England, in what is almost certainly a futile and cowardly attempt to disavow her guilt, claims she was  urlLink  just following orders   .  Meanwhile, Jeremy Sivits tells a different story in which the soldiers actively  urlLink  hid the abuse   from superiors, fearing they would be punished.  It is possible that both accounts are true, since there is lingering doubt as to  urlLink  who was in charge   at Abu Ghraib.  This means that soldiers may have hid the abuse from some superiors while being influenced by others.  I do not offer a definitive answer to any of the questions around this case, but I think that I have made a case that the particular argument in question proves nothing except overwhelming blindness of its promoters to both the extent of homophobia in American culture and the extent of skewed portrayals of Arab masculinity in the American media.  We need to find the answers to these questions in order to try to figure out how to respond to both this incident and the ones sure to come in the future.  We cannot find these answers if we fail to be honest about our own culture and stop trying to use the issue as a political wedge or a propaganda piece.

      Having just finished writing about   Mean Girls  , I think it only appropriate to begin my first piece of investigative journalism.  Whenever Ms. Lohan opens her mouth in startled disbelief, in either of the two films I've seen her in, she suddenly looks almost exactly like Frankie Muniz of   Malcolm In the Middle Fame  .  I speculate that the two are brother and sister, or perhaps even the same person.  I am gathering various evidence, and as soon as I figure out how to post images here, I'll reveal the most startling revelation to date in this case.  Also -- I am trying to figure out how I can make links inside my post.  That is, how can I make words into links that go to other sites, as opposed to posting a link at the end or beginning of my post?  If anyone has any ideas on how this is done, please let me know!  And of course, any leads in the Franksay Munhan case are much appreciated!  I just spent 20 minutes trying to find good photos of the two/one in question that matched decently to no avail.  Links to come, I promise!  The truth will come out.

      As promised, this blog will often feature my take on movies I've seen, both new and old.  And so, as my first real, non-rambly post, I present my thoughts on   Mean Girls  , the new comedy from Tina Fey (the greatest thing   SNL   has going for it) and Mark Waters (the greatest thing Lindsay Lohan has going for her.)    Mean Girls   is a smart and genuinely funny movie.  Fey's screenplay engages all the cliches of High School Movies and subverts them for her own perverse, and surprisingly realistic, purposes.  For the hysterical one-liners alone, this movie could be viewed more than once ("Once she punched me in the face.  And it was AWESOME!" or, even better, "Karen, you can't just ask someone why they're white.")  Except for the ending, which ties everything together in a both predictable and surprising sort of way, everything in the movie is entirely believable, and it lacks the usual moral dynamic of teen movies (bullies are evil, victims are innocent.)  The victimized Janis Ian is as cruel in her way as the queen bee is in hers, and Lindsay Lohan's Cady traverses from one group to another with cool, energetic abandon.  From an experiment, to trying to fit in, to becoming the master of the mean girl universe, she can not be seen as free from guilt.  In that sense this film wields its moral weight in the same way that another great high school film,   The Breakfast Club  , does.  In the course of the film's timeline all the walls are broken down and the fear, rage and vulnerability of the characters is laid bare for us to watch, with voyeuristic glee and some really great jokes.  Mark Waters is not a great director, but he is a good one.  He seems especially adept at drawing out inspiring performances from comedic actresses.  Parker Posey in   The House of Yes  , Lindsay Lohan (again) and especially Jamie Lee Curtis in the fun   Freaky Friday  , and now a whole posse of them here.  Lindsay Lohan manages just the right mixture of nerdy, foreign student delusion and beautiful, big-breasted popular-girl poise.  The Plastics are all three played with perfection, as each actress manages to show herself as a real person, if a serious f'ed up one, in small moments.  The script is, of course, fair to them, and that helps.  Still, too many young actresses would rush through these lines with as much ditzy speed as they could manage and fail to hit the right notes or find the right rhythm.  None of the performances here fall flat.  But special note should be taken of two performances that I especially liked.  The first is Jonathan Bennett's sweet rendering of the typical love-interest character.  Unlike most of these stock types in teen movies, one can actually understand why Cady wants him so badly.  He's handsome, but not extravagantly so, he's smart and actually seems to, you know, care about her and want to help her out with her math homework, even though he's not that good at math.  There is no more tender moment in this movie than when, at the end, he repeats Cady's conflation of 'cool' and 'great' and answers whatever she was saying with "Grool."  The other is the always-adorable and funny Tina Fey, who manages to step outside the assigned personality of her   Weekend Update   anchorwoman to play the kind of math teacher I think we'd all have preferred -- dorky, smart, cute, charming and encouraging, she manages some of the best lines in the film and delivers the core message of the movie in a way that doesn't sound quite as preachy as, in fact, it is.  "We have to stop calling each other sluts and whores. That only makes guys think it's okay to call us sluts and whores."  She just says it.  There is no swell of orchestral music or chest-thumping, she is simply speaking the truth.  And along with various high school secrets we all know but are afraid to talk about (math geeks love rap, band geeks make out all the time in the most disgusting ways possible, students really do make out with gross, hairy-backed gym teachers) this movie does exactly that.  It tells the truth about our messy, nasty, jungly adolescence in a way so funny that it can only be comforting.  Thank God I'm not in high school anymore.

      One's first posting on a new blog should, I suppose, be revelatory and witty.  Or at the least interesting.  This posting is none of those things.  It is my birthday and I've decided to start blogging at the hysterical insistence of my friend Ben who threatened to sign me up against my will if I didn't do it.  This blog is not intended to be a diary of my life.  I will never (or nearly so) write about my roommate's cat's vomit or my ingrown hairs or my scandalous crush of Pervez Musharraf.  Actually, I will talk about that last one, since he's an important figure in world affairs, and full disclosure is important.  So, the puking cat being out of the bag, I have a scandalous crush of Pervez Musharraf.  I wouldn't mind a bit if he resigned as President of Pakistan and became President of my Ass right now.  I have written him several letters on this subject, but to no avail.  If any of you have better contacts with various world-wide dictators, please pass them along.  The primary purpose of this blog is for me to write about politics and movies and whatever else I feel like writing about.  So please check-in frequently to see what I have to say.  Unless you hate what I have to say, in which case go read someone's angsty emo diary blog about cat barf and eye makeup.  That's all for now. I'm already tired of listening to myself.

      From  urlLink  Ann Coulter's column on Bill's book:   OK, uncle. You win, Mr. President. If I buy a copy of your book, will you just shut up once and for all, go away, and never come back? It will cost me $35, but, judging strictly by weight, that isn't a bad price for so much cow manure. At 957 pages, this is the first book ever published that contains a 20-minute intermission. Readers are advised to put it down and read a passage from Clinton's 1988 D.N.C. speech nominating Dukakis just to stay awake. This thing is so long, he almost called it "War and Peace." Or, I suppose, more properly, "War and a Piece."  and, even more delcious:  Clinton claims, for example, that conservatives decided to target him in lieu of the Soviet Union after the Cold War ended and conservatives needed a new villain. In other words, Clinton is equating himself, in scale and importance, to the Soviet Union, the global communist conspiracy and the Marxist-Leninist Revolution. Nope, no ego problem there. ("My Life" was Clinton's second choice title, after the publisher balked at naming the book "I Am God, and You Are All My Subjects.")

      David Foster Wallace has a new collection of stories out and  urlLink  Laura Miller reviews it at Salon.   She makes a claim early on that Wallace is seeming less like Pynchon and more like Beckett.  This filled me with a sense of hope that perhaps Wallace, who displays a monumental talent and energy, might finally be narrowing his focus enough to write something that isn't heavy-handed, ugly, masturbatory and charmless.  The rest of the review leaves me with less hope.  She stakes out the plots of the stories in a way that reveals that Wallace's style remains burdensome, labored and awkward.  I might pick this one up anyway, just on the offchance that it's worthwhile.  Miller manages to find some examples of clean, delightful and powerful prose, though she presents this almost as a weakness ("conventionally beautiful prose").  Conventional or not, it's beautiful, if not perfect:  . . .having learned to leave himself and watch the whole rest unfold from a point overhead, and whatever was lost never thenceforth mattered, and the child's body expanded and walked about and drew pay and lived its life untenanted, a thing among things, its self's soul so much vapor aloft, falling as rain and then rising, the sun up and down like a yoyo.

Now today they say the Child Online Protection Act is probably unconstitutional and order a new trial!  Bravo!  3. Justice Clarence Thomas: He gets a special shout-out for being the greatest justice in the history of justices ever, anywhere.  Why?  He is a knee-jerk reactionary on every issue.  He is the only member of the Court who will support the President's detain-for-no-reason policies.  He hates abortion.  He hates gay rights.  He hates   Miranda .  But damn does he love porno!  Whenever a porn-related 1st Amendment case is before the Court, Thomas is pro-porn.  He can put his pubes on   my  Coke cans any day.  4.  urlLink  Real Ultimate Power!   An older favorite, but nothing beats this ninja homepage.  "Ninjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.

      Slate's got a nice little convo  urlLink  hashing out the Bush campaign's "Hitler ad."   Will Saletan is far more serious than necessary (but if his Kerryism's section is an example of his sense of humor we shouldn't be surprised.)  Jacob Weisberg, on the other hand, is awesome.  Some nice bits of Weisberg:  But the vileness of "Kerry's Coalition of the Wild-eyed" must not be allowed to obscure its essential hilarity. What moron came up with this idea? What are they smoking in Karl Rove's office? C'mon, Will. This ad is the campaign equivalent of  The Producers —an idea so egregiously tasteless and stupid that it might just succeed as camp . . .I know I should be disgusted by the attempted association of Democrats and Nazis, but it's too funny to get upset about. Cue the goose-stepping mädchen of the Brookings Institution! . . its argument [is] that Nazism was basically a failure to relax . . ."This is not a time for pessimism and rage," the screen text says, over an image of a not at all enraged John Kerry telling his camel joke.  But then Weisberg does get serious, with a devastating dismissal of Bush's new campaign theme:  In the president's view, is there ever "a time" for such sentiments? Would Bush have counseled optimism if he'd been a Jew facing the real Hitler in Germany in the 1930s, or a Kurd in Saddam's Iraq? Should the kidnapped U.S. Marine threatened with beheading by his captors be optimistic because optimism is the American way?  Bravo, Mr. Weisberg.  Bush's campaign ads will go down in the history of political camp, I'm sure, along with the silly and overlong JFK ad featuring a ditty with the fast-sung refrain: "Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy, Kennedy!"  But the campy fun of Bush's bumbling rhetoric shouldn't mask its essential effectiveness, or the vileness that lurks just under it.

      The Supreme Court handed down its three most anticipated decisions of the term on Monday.  This time of year is an exciting one for me, and a nervewracking one.  The Court puts off its big cases until the very end, and leaves us with knotted stomachs waiting to see which way they'll fall.  I worry that the court is too politicized, and too far to the Right.  My worries tend to be dashed with strong, progressive opinions from unlikely sources.  Last year's ruling by Justice Kennedy on Texas Sodomy Law was an astounding piece of legal reasoning, in which Kennedy went further in accepting gay rights than anyone had expected, and wrote eloquently on the place of queers in American society.  This year, the Court gives us  Hamdi , Gitmo and  Padilla .   Padilla  was punted, of course.  Padilla filed in the wrong court, five of the justices say.  But the reasoning in  Hamdi  almost certainly applies to Padilla's case as well.  Even if Padilla has to fight his way back to the SCOTUS (which he may not, under  Hamdi's  reasoning), there is a strong majority waiting to vote for him.  The most scorching piece of the decision came in John Paul Stevens's brilliant dissent which ended with these words: "For this Nation to remain true to the ideals symbolized by its flag, it must not wield the tools of tyrants even to resist an assault by the forces of tyranny."   Guantanamo was the case I thought the Court would favor the President in, because the detainees are not American and are being held "on foreign soil."  The Court was more narrowly divided here, though only the most conservative justices were in dissent.  The Court doesn't offer a specific plan for the detainees, but firmly asserts that the detainees must be given a  habeas  hearing.  From  habeas corpus  flows due process.  It's not easy to imagine how a  habeas  hearing wouldn't eventually result in full-scale trials for at least some detainees.  But it was   Hamdi  that is the most important decision.  Technically this was decided 6-3, but one of the dissenting opinions amounted to a concurring opinion on the essential outcome.   Hamdi  was actually an 8-1 decision, with only Clarence Thomas upholding the President's right to detain at will without presenting the body.  Four Justices, led by arch-pragmatist Sandra Day O'Connor, dismissed the president's basic contentions.  Yes, Congress gave the president authority to detain enemy combatants after 9/11, but that is a "narrow" group of people, limited to those who would return to fight another day.  Detention for interrogation only is illegal and clearly not authorized by Congress and stands in violation of the   habeas corpus  protections of the Constitution.  Echoing Stevens on Padilla, O'Connor writes: "[H]istory and common sense teach us that an unchecked system of detention carries the potential to become a means for oppression for others who do not present that sort of threat. . . We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens."  Sure she's not as eloquent as Stevens, but her knife is just as sharp.  Souter and Ginsburg file a concurring opinion in which they say the President has no authority to detain any enemy combatants at all under any circumstances (provided they are US citizens, which was the question before them.)  Congress must explicitly authorize the detention, which it did not do when it authorized "military action" following 9/11.  Two dissenters, Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens, go further yet.    Habeas corpus  is a fundamental right that cannot be abridged except by a specific (and unlikely) wholesale suspension of the right by Congressional act.  Scalia leaves no room for misunderstanding.  The Administration must allow a hearing more or less immediately or let the detainees walk.  Or convince Congress to abrogate the most fundamental of American rights.  This ruling isn't that surprising.  Judges take   habeas corpus  seriously for a number of reasons.  Not only is it so fundamental a right that it reaches back to the Magna Carta, and thus predates democracy, but it is also the basis for almost all judicial authority in criminal cases.  This Court in particular is defensive of its position as final arbiter of the law.  Conservatives on the Court may want to limit the judicial role in the legislative process, but they know that only the Court can protect the rights of citizens in times of war and are loathe to surrender.  It shouldn't surprise us that the Court's two extremists (Scalia on the Right, Stevens on the Left) have been spending a lot of time playing footsie this term.  They are both motivated by an untempered love for the Constitution and an unbending interpretation of it.  Scalia may support law enforcement more than Stevens does, but when it comes down to an obvious violation of an explicit right, "pragmatism" has no place in their vocabulary.  Scalia and Stevens are the Court's best writers, and most passionate voices.  The roaring of these judicial lions may not win the day, but they carry the moral heart of this Court.  I had worried that the Court might be willing to lay down their weapons and hand the President the   carte blanche  he sought.  My faith in the judiciary, and in this Court in particular, is reaffirmed by the ferociousness of their defense of   habeas corpus  in a difficult time.  I am also proud of them for basing a strong part of the   Hamdi  opinion on Fred Korematsu's testimony regarding his detention during WWII.  The Court's willingness to address a darker day in its history only makes this day brighter.  Justice lives and breathes in these nine men and women.  God Save the Court and let freedom reign, indeed.

      The Fagistan Comments pages are lighting up with good shit.  Here's a rundown.  1.  urlLink  Pierluigi raises some very important questions  in his comments on the space elevator.  I'm not sure if NASA is working on the farting-in-space problem, but I do know this comment was so funny I crapped my pants.  Good thing I wasn't weightless.  2.  urlLink  Jessica writes things, then erases them, then lies about it .  But what is most important is that she finally admits she is just dating Tom to get to me.  She points out a few problems to our potential union.  I will take care of them in short order.  a) okay, so she's dating my great friend Tom.  He has hair cancer.  He'll be dead in four months.  b) I'm married to her sister.  This marriage is null and void.  Firstly, I was already married to Rivers Cuomo at the time.  Secondly, Michigan does not recognize gay marriages.  Thirdly, in 13 months we have no yet consummated it.  c) I am gay.  This would be true, except for the fact that (as my former roommate Julian liked to point out) I only   pretend  to be gay to get chicks.  3.  urlLink  Fagistan goes international!   I get my first post from someone I have never heard of, and she's a sexy Argentine to boot!  I can't read her blog though, since I'm a monolingual American idiot.  Still, she does want me to teach her how to chew fingernails.  Sexy.

      Two fags just tried to check into the hotel, but ended up not staying.  As they were filling out forms one of them said to me, "Oh my God, where do you get your nails done?" I was horrified.  Where do I get my   nails done?   How fucking gay is that?  I pride myself on being typically un-gay in my rejection of exfoliation, moisturizer, manicures, pedicures, tight pants and shiny shirts.  Now some queen just waltzes right up and declares that he just   must  know where I get my manicure?  I wasn't even aware that I had great nails.  I chew them, for one thing.  Apparently I chew them really well or something.  I told the fag this and he said "Oh, you chew them?  They look so great!  Do you take clients?"  This was hysterical, of course, for so many reasons.  Can you imagine me getting paid, let's say, 75 dollars an hour, to chew on fags' fingernails?  It could be a new sensation!  Move over   Queer Eye For the Straight Guy , I've got some nail-munchin' to do!  It reminded me of an episode of Jerry Springer where one woman said her husband was very controlling and always made her chew his finger and toenails.  They then showed convenient back-stage footage of her chewing his toenails as she cried.  It was possibly the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life.  And to think I could soon be doing it professionally!  My new personal ad will read: "Tall, heavyset GWM, shaved head, goattee, GREAT NAILS (all natural chew-manicure), seeking anyone who will let me stick my pee-pee in their poo-poo.  No walks on beach, no condoms."  Thank you God.  For making me gay and giving me great nails.  You are too good to me.

       urlLink  British firm recreates T. Rex breath for a museum.   The odor was so foul the museum chose not to use it.  Why they commissioned it in the first place is a mystery.  The firm didn't mind, having previously worked on other inexplicable stenches:  "I've had otter poo on my desk," said Knight, who created the odor for a zoo's nature trail, alongside the smell of jaguar urine and rotting flesh.  Indeed, who  doesn't  go to a nature trail hoping to smell jaguar urine?  In fact, I imported a littler of jaguar kittens just to revel in their piss-stink.  If I'd only known of this firm before smuggling those babies in.

      So, the most delicious sex scandal in the 2004 election season has ended with Illinois Senatorial candidate Jack Ryan dropping out of the race to replace Peter Fitzgerald.  This is good news for Barak Obama, who was probably going to win anyway, but bad news for politics.  I love sex scandals, don't get me wrong.  Their is undeniable glee in the sweaty-browed responses of politicians struggling to explain themselves and knowing they are doomed.  It doesn't help that politicians reinforce their image (the FCC madness is only one example of how politicians seek to create an image of purity and decency in Washington that is obviously hypocritical and false.)  It also doesn't help when you throw in a hot sci-fi nerd's wet dream like Seven of Nine.  Still, wanting your wife to fuck you in public should never be a reason to drop out of a race.  Sexual experimentation and sexual freedom should be exactly that -- sexual, experimental and free.  I am happy that Mr. Obama didn't bring the issue into the race (it was mainly Chicago's media that did the work of unsealing the divorce records), even though the sleazy part of me is always delighted by mud-slinging, soap-opera style politics.  Salon has a witty  urlLink  little take on the scandal.   That privacy carries the day is largely for the good; there's an integrity and dignity to sexual discretion that anyone can appreciate. The downside, however, is that we have very little idea of what kind of sex "normal" people desire and have (plenty of which falls outside the missionary zone). This basic ignorance is the agar in which sex scandals are grown. If it were common knowledge that yes, even accomplished, ambitious men (and women) on the Hill might favor sexual experimentation, then maybe we could focus on what really matters. Desire isn't partisan, kink knows no party line, and neither is germane when it comes to gauging one's leadership potential. How political can a personal life become? How long until every politician's ISP records are dredged up, and every visit to www.bootlicker.com or www.gigglytoplessteens.net is counted up and trotted out as political fodder? Is it only a matter of time until every horny IM, cam-photo and e-mail is snared for future torpedo power? It's as if the PATRIOT Act and the Meese Report got together and had a nosy little baby. Boy, I'd hate to see this monster when it grows up.   Scary thought, isn't it?  This could be especially damaging to Tim's career.  He is www.bootlicker.com's most frequent visitor.  I have already encouraged him to draw out of his race against Pervez Musharraff for President of my Ass.

      Salon's got an  urlLink  interview with Thomas Frank , author of a book exploring the rise of populist Republicanism in Kansas.  Frank is part of a growing body of liberal Democrats who were born and raised in the South and West who see the national platform of the Democratic Party as self-defeating and idiotic.  There was a time in American politics when Democrats routinely swept the South, the Midwest and the West.  The West and Midwest were the most progressive regions of the country in the first half of the twentieth century (including the strong Progressive Republican movement in states like Wisconsin).  The staggering fact is that now Republicans control most of these states.  The strong showing for Republicans seems obvious to us, particularly to those of us who are too young to really remember the Democratic Party's heyday.  And yet, it is clearly not obvious.  Something happened.  And what happened is quite simply that Republicans adopted populist style and rhetoric without having to embrace populist ideology.  The Democratic Party self-consciously chose to embrace a very particular leftist vision of America based on a ragged coalition of environmentalists, social reformers, abortion-rights groups, gay-rights groups and other similar constituencies of single-issue-voters.  The Republicans chose to re-draft class warfare language as a fight against the "liberal media elite" -- against Manhattan and Hollywood and the universities, and have succeeded.  The discussion is interesting, though I think Frank misses a couple of points that must be addressed.  He gives the impression that simply re-embracing working class politics and policies would be enough to reconstitute the old New Deal Coalition.  He underplays the true importance of social issues to the modern conservative movement and voters' real dedication to these ideas.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again, a reinvigorated Democratic Party must embrace the 2nd Amendment as a key American freedom no less important than the freedom of speech or the freedom to jury trial.  Democrats must also rethink their positions of land-use.  This is particularly crucial in the Rocky Mountain West where so much of the land is federally owned.  Ranchers and outsdoorsmen must be assured that they will have access to the land and that knee-jerk environmentalism will not win the day.  A rational, consensus-based, state-by-state and watershed-by-watershed environmental policy makes more sense, and ends the deep injustice cause by New England liberals telling Montanans how to use their land.  If you take the issues of guns and land-use off the table, economic issues like farm policy and government assistance can once again move center-stage, and Democrats can push these issues hard and win on them.  Whether or not the Party needs to abandon its commitment to abortion and gay-rights and abolition of the death penalty is another question that I think is a little more tricky.  To an extent, some of these issues will fade away on their own as politically motivated people find other avenues to fight for.  Only time will tell.  But we cannot hope to build a coalition based on a coastal election strategy.  Long-term Democratic success requires a serious change in course on almost every level for the national party.  It is very possible -- as the outstanding success of Mark Warner in Virginia and of a number of new Democratic governors in the West (Wyoming, Kansas and Arizona among them) attests.  The really question is whether or not Democrats are brave enough to take the chance.

      For a while now, Rep. Charlie Rangel of New York has been pushing for a new compulsory military service program (it would include civil service as well) on the basis that if Congressmens' children were to be drafted, war would be less likely, and for the stronger argument that a draft would create a military that is more racially, economically and geographically balanced.  We know that blacks, the poor and the rural are over-represented in the military, so this seems to have solid merit.  But does it?  Fred Kaplan  urlLink  says no.   In fact, he makes a good statistical argument that those who sign up are more representative of the racial mix in America than we think (blacks are only slightly overrepresented, while Hispanics are underrepresented), and that the real difference comes at re-enlistment time.  Blacks tend to re-enroll at a much higher rate, creating an overall military in which blacks are almost twice as numerous as they are in the civilian population.  Many black leaders, including Rangel and Colin Powell, site the military as one of the most progressive of American institutions when it comes to race, and the higher rate of black membership might be seen as a good sign.  The US military is the most stunningly successful integration project in American history, and we should be proud of that.  Kaplan doesn't touch on this argument, but I think it's valid.  When blacks are underrepresented in law schools, we know we have a problem.  So why is that  over representation in the military is bad?  Well, the arguments are multiple here, and I can't go into them.  I think it would be better to have a military that was more clearly diverse in terms of class, far more than race.  But Kaplan also shoots down the standard argument that the military takes in the uneducated at a vastly higher rate than the educated.  In fact, according to Kaplan's statistics, soldiers read at an 11th grade level, while civilians read at a 10th grade level (on average), and soldiers score far higher on their entrance exams than civilians do.  Soldiers are better educated as well, with a significantly higher high school graduation rate.  Officers are now required to have college degrees, so among the civilian professional and military professional elites, the rates of education are also much higher in the military.  So, if anything, soldiers are smarter than us.  I have been intrigued by the Rangel plan, though I can't help but oppose compulsory military or civil service.  Kaplan's analysis makes it easier not to be intrigued.  He also offers the only fair solution to the soldier shortage problem: pay them more.  Far worse than the actual make-up of the armed services is our perception of it as a place where misfits, drop-outs and poor blacks congregate to sneak their way into college after they're done with their service.  If soldiers were honored for their work, and the easiest way to honor them is to make sure they are paid well, than the shortage might shrink considerably.  The same is true, after all, of the nursing shortage.  Hospitals willing to pay nurses highs salaries and with strong benefit packages are able to staff themselves without problem, those less willing have staffing crises.  In both cases, failure to pay well and maintain a full staff leads to the unnecessary loss of life.  So why aren't we willing to pay the price?

      Not only has Bush made a mess of Iraq, but he's exacerabted already dangerous conditions in North Korea, as detailed in Fred Kaplan's sharp Slate piece  urlLink  here.   From the moment Bush entered office he has worked to pull down the tenuous diplomatic ties Clinton was building.  Under Bush's watch, and in response to Bush's abrogation of the Agreed Framework, Kim Jong-Il's regime has begun reprocessing their fuel rods into plutonium.  This plutonium could be made into weapons any time now, with potentially catastrophic results for the stability of the region and the lives of millions of people.  Bush had hoped that a military threat would topple Kim's regime.  Instead, it has only encouraged the deranged dictator to step up his own programs, under the auspices of defense.  And despite his derangement, Kim has proven to be a clever negotiator and strategist, outplaying Bush at every hand.  Bush has finally allowed the State Department to make an offer, and guess what, it's almost identical to the original Agreed Framework (including stipulations that we will not undermine or topple his regime.)  Kim may not even accept the offer.  So here we are, nearly four years in the Bush Administration and we've finally gotten to the point where he is offering North Korea the same deal he rejected in 2001.  When the Agreed Framework was put into place, North Korea was eager to move toward normalization of relations and the end of economic sanctions.  Now Kim is in a stronger position, and knows it.  If a deal is made, count on Bush to trumpet it as a diplomatic success.  Never mind that it is a success to a problem Bush created.  The President is now in a position where the best he can hope for is a return to the deal we already had Pyongyang's commitment to until Bush threw it out.  Most likely, if he is interested in a deal, he will have to offer more to N. Korea than Bill Clinton did.  Any Bush-brokered deal is likely to be less restrictive on Kim Jong-Il than what we already had, and thus more dangerous in the long run.  No matter what happens, and I do hope for a diplomatic solution, there is nothing successful about Bush's arrogant ineptitude.

      I think this post will evade Pierluigi's dictat banning Moore posts, since this is not an anti-Moore post.  Both Hitchens and  urlLink  Sully  compare Moore to Leni Riefenstahl (Hitchens broadens his comparison to include Sergei Eisenstein in a somewhat troubling move.)  Hitchens is willing to point out that Moore lacks the talent of either of those filmmakers, and that's obvious.  But such comparisons are unfair to everyone involved, and only show an almost desperate attempt by Moore's detractors to label him as a proto-fascist.  As Ann Coulter has pointed out, bringing Nazis into a conversation automatically reduces the argument to the level of kids on a playground.  Sensible discourse is killed by comparing almost anyone to Hitler or his surrogates.  In fact, the only reason to make such a comparison is to kill sensible discourse.  When you're back is against the wall, and you're out of ammo, start screaming HITLER!  STALIN!  HITLER! And someone is bound to come to your aid.  What's worst about Sully and Hitch and the rest of the anti-Mooreons using this tactic is that it's gratuitous.  You don't need to compare Moore to Riefenstahl to prove he's a propagandist with little sense of history or politics or philosophy.   So using it serves a purpose that is intellectually indistinct from the worst excesses of Moore's work.  Fighting based on facts alone is not good enough for Hitchens, always the polemicist, or his dear friend Sully.  No, beating your opponent fairly just isn't fun.  You have to fight as dirty as he does.  The fact that this discredits virtually all of Moore's critics on the Right and a good portion of his critics on the Left doesn't seem to register to any of them.  It's the old "When they tell lies, they're lies, when I tell them it's truth." argument that is, in fact, far closer to Riefenstahl's ideology of film than Moore's films are.  But this argument could serve a legitimate role if it were an accurate assessment of Moore's work.  But it is not.  Riefenstahl (and Eisenstein if we're willing to include him among kneejerk propagandists, which I'm really not) served an existing state and sought to give that government legitimacy through film.  Not only were the ideas that motivated her greatest works morally wrong, on a far grander scale than Moore is morally wrong, but she served a government that had the ability to act on those ideas.  Moore doesn't even represent the opposition to Bush in the US government, or any source of likely political power in America.  He is, in fact, trying to unseat the sitting government and stop acts he views as being indefensible.  Whether or not he's right, and whether or not his means are either adequate or acceptable in such a cause, does not alter the fact that Moore's goals, ideologies, and power are far out of scale to Leni Riefenstahl's.  Pretending that Moore's films are in the service of something as horrific as the Holocaust both cheapens the lives of the ten million and exalts Moore to a status he is undeserving of, while bringing rational debate and the all-too-rarefied realm of facts and logic, crashing to their knees.

       urlLink  Scientist says space elevator could be up and running in 15 years.   The space elevator has become a staple of science fiction and now has serious backers within the US space program.  The elevator would be thinner than a piece of paper, and perhaps three feet wide, and capable of carrying loads of up to 13 tons.  A really cool space elevator would have to have a heavier payload, but this will do for now.  Why are space elevators not only cool, but more or less essential for a large-scale space program?  Because the elevator lifts its cargo out of Earth's gravity well, the fuel expended to transport goods between planets or other space-objects would be greatly reduced and the cost of such interplanetary trade would accordingly plummet.  I am critical of Bush's Mars plan -- in part because it doesn't seem to be part of a larger colonization scheme, and because of its enormous cost.  But the elevator, which would have a modest budget of around $10 billion, would have greater impact on the entire space program for little cost and could eventually make colonization a real possibility.  So build the fucking elevator already, NASA!  Do something useful for the first time in your damned existence and give us the key to space!  And once again allow us sci-fi-reading nerdy prognosticators the ecstatic joy that only comes from being right.  O, space elevator, how I do wax my pole to thee.

      In Helena High School's tour de force production of Thornton Wilder's   Our Town,  I made a riveting turn as Doc Gibbs.  No one in the history of American theater has ever mimed eating a banana quite like me.  Of course, what I was really miming was sucking a giant, slightly curved dick.  But that is beside the point.  The real genius to my performance was my New Hampshah accent.  I based this accent on Dr. Seth Hazlett of   Murder She Wrote  fame.  When I said "Couldn't be easiah -- easay as kittens!" I imagined I was saying "Jessica, the autopsay says Mistah Ahnold was poisoned!"   urlLink  Jessica is kind enough to recognize the perfection of my Seth impression.   Thank you, Jessica.  I'd proudly be the elderly country doctor to your elderly crime novelist/investigator anyday.  As long as I don't have to mime anything.

Sorry for the abundance of the hated exclamation points, but I'm excited.  I love Mr. Gorenfeld's investigative journalism, and his blog may well represent the underground future of that profession.

      Ben picks up on my (not so sly) reference to  urlLink  Realldolls.   My love for Realdolls knows no bounds.  Though, I will admit I haven't been to the site in a while.  Now they have a male RealDoll.  His name is  urlLink  Charlie.   He's not as creepy as the female Realdolls.  Mostly because dead naked men are never as frightening as dead naked women.  Still, there are many photos of him waxing his wood and taking a bath, including this hot hot HOT pic of Charlie  urlLink  grabbing a towel.   One can also, of course, opt for the  urlLink  She-Male Realdoll , in which a penis is added to any of the models.  You can choose to keep the vagina intact or eliminate it.  For those on a budget, there is always the  urlLink  Realdoll Torso.   The highlight of any Realdoll aficionado visit to Realdoll.com remains the  urlLink  FAQ.   Here are some highlights:    Question: What if I don't fit with RealDoll's sex parts?   REALDOLL's vaginal and anal cavities are made snug to accommodate any insertion. The silicone flesh is soft, slippery, and very elastic. Any petroleum or water-based lubricants can be applied to ease entry. REALDOLL's oral cavity contains soft silicone tongue and teeth. The oral cavity is as snug as the doll's other entries. All of REALDOLL's cavities allow deep insertions.    Question: Tell me more about RealDoll's "suction effect"   When penetrated, a vacuum is formed inside REALDOLL's entries which provides a powerful suction effect. This effect is strongest in REALDOLL's oral entry. Some of REALDOLL's users have reported intense orgasms due to this specific feature.    Question: Can water become trapped inside the doll?  No. REALDOLL's body is not hollow. REALDOLL is a SOLID love doll.    Question: What happens when "the honeymoon is over" and I feel that the doll is not for me and wish to return it?  Although we'd like to fully satisfy all our customers, our firm policy is: ALL SALES ARE FINAL.    Question: I'm a crossdresser interested in a full body silicone female skin. Can I buy a REALDOLL skin or can you tell me where I can get a silicone female body suit?   We don't offer silicone body suits and REALDOLL does not have a separate skin. REALDOLL is a solid silicone doll. To our knowledge, no company offers a silicone female body suit. A silicone suit would require a sophisticated cooling system (silicone retains heat and does not breathe), and be custom-fitted to your body from a life-cast. We don't offer such services and we don't know anyone who does.    Question: Do you have any rejects or used models I can buy for cheap?   No.

      Salon also has another excerpt from Craig Seligman's book on  urlLink  Sontag and Kael .  This time the excerpt is about Kael's reputation as a homophobe and whether or not it is justified (Seligman says no, I'm not entirely convinced that her attitudes about homos were as enlightened as he thinks.)  Still, Seligman manages to diagnose a problem rampant in Leftist circles (both moderate and radical wings), and makes exactly the point I tried to back about   The Hyena  back in my EAGLE days:  The gay attacks on Kael are obviously painful to me, and not just because, as a gay friend of hers, I feel injured by assaults on her good name. To me they represent something far more destructive. They embody the same hopeless script that progressives have enacted again and again for the past century. Why does the left persist in exhausting itself by attacking its allies instead of its enemies? Why do deviations from orthodoxy provoke so much bitterness that the left winds up shifting its energy, its passion, away from the true threats? What was gained by creating a straw villainess out of Kael at a time when homosexuals had so many real antagonists who were virulent, indefatigable and gleefully out in the open?

      The King of Peace, Sun Myung Moon, has offered us some  urlLink  insight into how one should go about consummating one's marriage.   After some prayer, you must throw salt on the floor.  Since Satan has high blood pressure, this will keep him out.  Then you must make sure that there is a photo of the Reverend in the room, so that he can watch.  If possible, it would be preferable to have him behind a moose head, talking to you like Truman Capote in   Murder by Death .  The woman must take the initiative throughout the first two days, as she is in the position of "Mother of the Messiah" and the man is an archangel who is reborn as sinless Adam (in the formation stage -- I guess it's kinda Freudian or something.)  On the second day the same ritual is repeated, except that the man now enters the "growth stage" of Adam.  On the third day the man must "restore dominion."  This means he now gets to be on top.  Specific instruction is given to the wife that she should "respond to and cooperate with the man."  This is good instruction, as otherwise she'd be likely to lay there like a  urlLink Real Doll.   There are some further "notes."  This one is for Jamie Lee Curtis: "The act of love should be a complete act (penetration and ejaculation). In the event that it is difficult to achieve this, strive to achieve as much penetration as possible and continue with the remainder of the ceremony."  This is for ladies who marry a faggot by accident: "If insertion is not possible because the husband does not have an erection, the wife must take her husband's sexual organ in her hand and guide it into her sexual part in order to successfully do the ceremony."  Don't worry, it's not ALL robotic: "For the act of love, it is all right to caress each other."  A big thanks to the Salon Archives for  urlLink  providing the link.

      I sort of agree with Pierluigi about Mr. Moore.  I mean, sure, I'm always willing to say nasty things about him.  I've mostly tried to keep my head low during all of this, because what do I have to say that I haven't said?  Or that more intelligent people, with better writing skills, haven't already?  That's why I prefer to use Moore as a platform to talk about how Tarantino is a douche and how antiwar activists are confused and irrelevant.  Problem is, there are two equally compelling theories at work.  One is that even talking about him sarcastically and viciously legitmizes his work.  We don't talk about things that are truly irrelevant.  Ignoring him would probably make him shut up fast.  On the other hand, as the movie opens, and as other media outlets bombard us with all kinds of crap (pro and anti) it may be okay to add our voices.  I don't know.  This is the end of me talking about him for a while, is my point.  I have better things to talk about.  Like these pictures of nut sacs filled with saline solution I was looking at earlier.  That shit is wicked!  Ben wants to use his blog as a therapeutic tool.  Benny, if you're going to work through your issues via blog, will you at least pay us $250 per hour to listen?

      Ben carried this link to  urlLink  a critique of Hitch's critique of Moore's movie .  You can all read it for yourself, but I was amused by a few bits in particular.  Need I say, on behalf of all those who claim a leftist affiliation out there, that when a lefty version of Limbaugh comes along we want nothing to do with it. Limbaugh fights without facts, he alleges and abuses, he makes statements that he knows are untrue, simply because nobody can refute them to his large audience without coming on his show. And nobody is likely to do that unless they like being talked over.  Sounds like he's describing Michael Moore to me.  No one can refute Moore to his audience because his audience won't read Chris Hitchens anyway, or believe him if they do.  The fact that this man thinks Hitchens is a "partisan hack," shows that Moore's admirers are mostly the kind of leftists who view anyone who disagrees with ever on anything to be "apologists" for Bush.  Hitchens is actually still a vital part of the Left, but of a more eclectic and energetic left than what passes for one around these parts.  In his response to Hitch's discussion of Saudi capital, this guy says: "Yes. 7% of all wealth in the United States [is Saudi], according to Moore's figures."  The important point here is   according to Moore's figures.   We know from the countless exposes of Moore's tactics in his earlier films and in his books that he makes figures up, plagiarizes them haphazardly from other sources, and otherwise manipulates data.  The work done at Spinsanity was particularly wide-ranging on this issue.  Anyone who is willing to take Moore's word for it is as delusional as any Limbaugh-listener.  He also dismisses Hitch's mentioning of the fact that the photo of Bush "relaxing" at Camp David included Prime Minister Blair in the photo.  The excuse offered is, "Well okay, so maybe THAT time he was working . . . but I'm sure there are other photos."  Okay.  Well if Bush took off more time in two years than Clinton and Carter did in 12, why was it so hard to find one?  Why did Moore pick one in which the President was "vacationing" with another head-of-state?  Is Moore a lazy researcher, a liar or both?  And besides, arguments about the President's long vacations bore me.  When Congress is not in session there is little for the President to do that he can't do by phone when necessary.  One of the problems for Carter and Clinton was that they tried to do their Cabinet Secretaries' jobs for them.  Why have a Cabinet if the President does all the work anyway?  The rest of it is the usual cicumlocutions antiwar activists go through regarding the morality of the war.  The only time it's okay to mention Saddam's genocidal war against his own people is when we mention that it was really America's fault.  The rest of the time, it's important to pretend that all was quiet and peaceful in Iraq before American bombs arrived.  Moore, and this guy, sound more and more like those archaic leftists in the 80's who visited the Soviet Union and came back to say "What gulags?  What purges?  The Soviet system is alive, well, and beautiful!"  This reveals the real bias at the heart of the pacifism.  When it is brown people killing brown people, there is no war to be anti, but when pretty white Americans might be in danger, time to make documentaries and march in the streets.  A parting question for all antiwar leftists out there (I am one, after all): How do you say "We should not have gone to war with Iraq," without meaning, "Saddam should still be in power?"  Until we can answer that with a straight face, and without twisty logic, we have no business criticizing the president.  He, at least, had something vaguely resembling a plan.

      Mattie Stepanek, child poet and muscular dystrophy patient, died today.  Everyone gets mad when I make fun of him, because he had a terrible disease.  I know it's not nice to make fun of children with diseases.  The problem with Mattie is that he's a child with a disease who is also one of the best selling contemporary poets.  It's a no-win situation with Mattie.  If you acknowledge his disease in a negative way, people say you should just see him "as a person" but if you criticize his poetry then you're "worse than a Nazi, mocking a poor child with MD."  But if I'm supposed to take him seriously, then I have to treat him like I would any other poet (which is what he'd want afterall.)  So in that spirit, I offer you some of his poetry, with commentary in brackets.  "On Growing Up, Part Five"  We are growing up We are many colors of skin We are many languages We are many ages and sizes. We are many countries... But we are one with the earth. We each have one heart. We each have one life We are growing up, together, So we must live as one family.  [There is not one genuine or original sentiment in this poem.  He is certainly quite observant, and his New Age embrace of the Earth is delightful.  Wait, did I say that?  I meant trite and annoying.  And I'd love to live as one family, but there are no shitty poets in my family, so, sorry, Mattie.]  "God's Language"  Do you know what Language God speaks? God speaks Every-Language. That's because God made Everyone and Gave Everyone different Languages. And God understands all of them. And do you know what is God's Favorite Language? God's favorite language is Not grown-ups's language, But the Language of Children. That's because children Are special to God.  Children know how to share, And they never lose  Their Heart-Songs.   [They never lose their Heart-Songs?  First of all, what is a heart-song?  And second of all, if they never lose them, then grown-ups would have them too . . . so why isn't God's favorite language Every-Language?  And why is Everything in this Poem Capitalized?]  "On Growing Up, Part 3"  I'm not so sure about growing up. I know that I want to grow up. But I always thought I wanted to  Be a doctor, a priest, a Grandmaster In Hapkido, and a daddy. Well I'm not so sure I will be a doctor. I wanted to be a doctor because I love Dr. Terry Flotte, and because I want to fix mommy and me, and I wanted to bring back Jamie  And Katie and Stevie back Because even though Heaven is a Wonderful place, Heaven is a place a Forever place. So I've decided that I want to be A writer instead of a doctor.  I like words. I like reading. I like writing. I like making up stories. I like making up poems. Mommy is a writer. I like being like mommy, too. I can still do important things Even if I'm not a doctor. I can write about peace and love Like Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesus. I can write about adventures Like Robert Loius Stevenson and Like Mary Pope Osborne and  Like the one who did Star Wars. I can write and tell about fantasy And about funny things and lots and Lots of things that teach people All kinds of stuff. That's why I've decided that I should be a writer when I grow up. Oh, and I will still be a priest, And a Hapkido Grandmaster, And a daddy, too.  [I'm not sure what to say about this one.  He's already compared himself to Jesus and MLK, Jr. which pretty much covers his ego.  He also thinks he can be a priest and a daddy, so he's headed for some awfully sinful behavior.  The "I like words" part is somewhat moving, but sporadic, and lacking in method and refinement.  The line "Heaven is a place a Forever place" is almost interesting, and almost verse, but something about it, perhaps the awkward repitition and the sentiment behind it, seem somehow immature and untrained.]  On Being a Champion   A Champion is a winner, A hero... Someone who never gives up Even when the going gets rough. A champion is a member of A winning team... Someone who overcomes challenges Even when it requires creative solutions. A champion is an optimist, A hopeful spirit... Someone who plays the game, Even when the game is called life. There can be a champion in each of us, If we live as a winner, If we live as a member of the team, If we live with a hopeful spirit, For Life.   [A champion is somehow who can read this poem.  The last time I read a poem like this it was called a dictionary.  Also, the Capitalization continues to be inconsistent.  Life is capitalized in the final line but not in Line 12, where it would be more appropriate.  Mr. Stepanek needs to development his ideas more fully.  After all, doesn't "live as a winner" really just mean "win?"  The continued attempt by people including Mr. Stepanek, to appropriate the words winner and champion and seek to apply them to anyone who does anything at all even if they fail miserably seems to be intellectually bankrupt and empty.  If life is about struggle and winning, then where is the dark side to all of this, Mattie?]  I think it says something, perhaps a great deal, about our culture when our bestselling poet is Mattie Stepanek.  I am all for supporting Mattie's struggle with his illness.  I am not for the publication of puerile children's poems and Oprah gushing all over this kid.  He is not a prodigy in any sense of the word.  If he didn't have MD would we be reading this crap, much less buying so much of it that it hit No. 1 on the NYT Best seller list, something poetry almost never does?  If you answered "yes," you're an imbecile and I hope you'll please stop talking to me.  If you answered "no," then please join me in taking a shot of whiskey for everytime "heart song," "bravery," "courage," "champion," and "sadness" is spoken by someone other than the boys family in the next two days.

      Salon's indie publishing critic Scott Thill  urlLink  catches wind of   In Me Own Words: The Autobiography of Bigfoot.    This book is possibly the funniest thing I've ever read, and it only gets better with each read.  here is Thill's take:   In my online magazine, Morphizm, we have a section called "Whatcha Missed" that reexamines work that floated right on by while everyone was obsessed with whatever the flavor-of-the-month standout was at the time. In that spirit of rediscovery, I had to include this insanely hilarious graphic novel.   See, I already had another, newer, more hype-worthy book set aside for this spot -- never fear, it'll be here next time around -- but I made the mistake of grabbing "In Me Own Words" at my local indie bookstore (a shout out to Santa Monica, Calif.'s Midnight Special), and it has come to dominate my life ever since. And not just mine, see, but also the lives of everyone I have shown it to. Trust me, this thing is catchier than gonorrhea, and much, much funnier.   Like the title says, this is more or less the autobiography of Bigfoot, the resident alien that used to rule conspiracy theorists everywhere until Chris Carter rewrote the rule book with the aforementioned "X-Files." And don't think that the fact that his profile has pretty much disappeared has escaped Bigfoot's mind -- in fact, it has violently galvanized him. "What happen world, me ask?" Bigfoot writes. "Me once believe in good. Now, no. World go shit just like Bigfoot screenwriting career."   Emblazoned with crude watercolor hilarity, courtesy of Mr. Foot himself, and splashed with coffee and other stains from who knows what, "In Me Own Words" is the authoritative account of Bigfoot's life, loves and, most important, seething dislikes. Chewbacca gets taken out ("He ride Bigfoot coat tails"), Pat Morita gets beat down ("He snob ... Maybe I smash with log"), Sam Donaldson gets threatened ("Me take him hair and eat man"), Koko the gorilla gets love ("He talk with hands ... Change me life") and much more. The crappy drawing of Bigfoot's annual Halloween costume as Stevie from "The Deer Hunter" (Christopher Walken's character) playing Russian roulette is worth the price of the book all by itself.   Let me be clear about this: No matter what I write or how I describe this book, it will not do it justice. It is so freakin' funny that you'll be out of breath by the time you get to Bigfoot's "Police Academy" screen test. And after browsing through Solanas, Ronell, Lacan and philosophical treatises on "The Sopranos," you're going to need a chaser of some sort. Let Bigfoot be your guide .

      Jack Ryan, Republican nominee for the US Senate in Illinois, was accused by ex-wife Jeri Lynn Ryan of  urlLink  pressuring her to perform sex acts in front of the audience at a sex club.   The New York sex club was one ‘‘with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling," according to the ex-Mrs. Ryan.  Mr. Ryan says this is not true: "We did go to one avant-garde nightclub in Paris which was more than either one of us felt comfortable with. We left and vowed never to return."   Only a Republican pervert would possibly think that sex clubs are "avante-garde."  Now, unless Barak Obama has also been involved in the avante-garde movement, the Democrat should have no trouble beating a character from a Tom Clancy novel.

      How 'bout the Beastie Boys?  Slate also has a vaguely (okay, irritatingly) amusing  urlLink  review of their new album.   I don't know about any of you, but listening to the Beastie Boys is a little like putting razor blades into my pee hole and then jacking off.  My only delight in them is how skinny and hot the one of them is in his leather pants in that one video.  I can't remember which one.  I only saw it once, on the Criterion Beastie Boys thing.  Still, you have to hand it to any reviewer who is willing to write an entire piece in rhymed couplets (okay, so some of them are strained and grating, but, it befits his subject I suppose.)  To give you an idea of how far he'll stretch for an appropriate rhyming metaphor, watch him use the   Golden Girls  for material:   They rock their advanced years like Dorothy Zbornak, and they haven't brought the live funk or the hardcore back, since they've given up the hope of getting Kennedy Center honors. Now their beats are All-One, like a bottle of Dr. Bronner's

      Not really.  But Slate reviews the  urlLink  Dylan treatise  by a noted scholar of Milton and Eliot.  Unsurprisingly then, the scholar's main focus is on sin and virtue and the texts of the "great poet" Bob Dylan.  Ricks, apparently, reads Dylan as a poet and ignores rock n' roll altogether.  The writer of the piece, on the other hand, conflates songwriting and poetry, railing against the "elevation of the poet above the songwriter."  The assumption is, of course, that songwriters are poets.  Whether or not poets should be ranked higher than songwriters is another question.  Almost no songwriters are poets.  They are two distinct artistic forms.  Because the lyrics of songs   look like poems  we assume they are poems.  Even though most rock songs are too repetitive, too rhyme filled, and too inelegant to work on the page without music behind them.  Rock n' roll's real ancestor is not poetry but opera -- the conflation of theater and music.  Rock is performative art and therefore can't be treated in the same way that poetry can (the one caveat would be poetry that is essentially meant to be read aloud, all that highly rythmic spoken-word business that appeared on the scene around the time rock n' roll did).  That's not to say that some songwriters might not count as poets.  Dylan looks better on paper than he sounds.  Jeff Tweedy's stuff would be fairly light poetry, but would work I think.  A small bit of Liz Phair, part of the Beatles, a line or two of Michael Stipe.  There are others of course (your nominations are appreciated.)But imagine listening to someone sing "The Wasteland" or Sylvia Plath's "Lady Lazarus" and you can at least begin to see how poetry, especially 20th century poetry, has far too complex a structure to be contained in a song, particularly a pop song.  Obviously, the scholar is wrong to ignore Dylan's music, because it's an attempt to enshrine him in the pantheon of poetry and sort of pretending he didn't have a guitar. But it's equally inane to say that rock music   is  poetry.  Just add music.  Until we're willing to fully divorce the disciplines of songwriting and poetry can we even begin to really understand what is so brilliant about great songwriters.  Even Dylan can't come off well when compared to Tennyson and Keats.  Just as Eliot and Pound, set to music, would not come off well next to John Lennon or Jeff Tweedy.  Or, for that matter, my husband, Rivers Cuomo.

      Ben  urlLink  compares my penis to Colin Farrell's .  Ben is half (well, probably 10%) right.  My dick did cause quite a sensation when filmed and screened by various Emerson film students.  Apparently, Emerson only admits kindergarten students these days (that might explain the abundance of midgets, where did they all come from?  And why was one a coke dealer?) . . .but the sensation was not because of the enormous size of my sweet meats but instead the difficulty most viewers had in figuring out if I was even really naked.  Is that?  Could it be?  That little blob right there?  Yeah, I think it's his dick? Really?  How is that possible?  Maybe he's intersexed and its just a really big clitoris?  I'd rather have a giant clitoris than a tiny dick, that's for sure.  Yeah, poor guy . . .  Luckily, this film's "plot" consisted on me praying naked, handing out fliers, getting beaten up, and then jacking off to a nun/priest porno before splooging to a picture of Christ Our Saviour.  The distraction was welcome.

      1. Write a letter to Delilah telling her that you and your fiance do not have a song that is "yours" yet, but need one by the wedding.  You are both middle aged, with grown children, and are so happy to have finally found your "soul-mates."  Could Delilah please pick a song for you, even though she has never met you, doesn't know anything about you and has the worst taste in love songs ever?  Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, or perhaps Dionne Warwick, will be great additions to your marriage.  2. Call Delilah to tell her you love your mom even though she is abandoning you for a new "man in her life."  Ask Delilah to play a song for Mom and then listen as Delilah lectures you on how single moms still need lovin' in their lives.  3. Listen to Delilah show all night, finger poised over the RECORD button of your tape deck, so you can record the Delilah theme ("Please love somebody tonight!!") over and over again, interspersed with particularly wise words from D herself.  4. Create a Delilah drinking game.  Whenever she says "god bless" take a drink, whenever she says "just have faith" take a drink.  Whenever she plays "I Can't Make You Love Me" take a drink.  Whenever she gives bad advice, take a drink.  Whenever she gives good advice take two drinks.  5. This is not an idea, but an actual Delilah story.  (as are, frankly, 1 and 2 on this list): A young mega faggy man calls up and says how he is in college and his best friend in the whole world is a girl who is his R.A. and he loves her a lot but she is moving away and he's sad so he wants Delilah to pick a song.  Why people trust Delilah with this duty is beyond me.  I mean, does "I Will Always Love You" really capture your experience with college friends?  Even if you're a fag and your fag hag is moving away?  I never played this song for Melissa Izzo, even though she deserved it for being so ugly.  Anyway . . . Delilah is about as smart as this keyboard I'm typing on, so she says "So is she your friend or your . . . . girl friend?"  And the kid is obviously stunned.  He's so gay that the thought of someone not realizing that he has a buttplug in right now is beyond his comprehension.  He starts stuttering, gurgling, like a child who just ate rat poison.  Across all these miles and all those Hz I can feel him come to a realization: "I've been wasting four hours of every night of my life for the last 4 years listening to this woman's show and she's a fucking   moron! ."  Finally, he spits out, "No!  She's just my friend."  Delilah, undeterred, chuckles her throaty, semisexy chuckle and breathes, "You don't seem sure about that . . ."

A blog dedicated to reading Andrew Sullivan's work and revealing its flaws and contradictions.  The overall tone is pretty mean, and I think misses much of the point of why Sullivan is such a beautiful genius, but it's an addition to the Sullivan world.  3.   Running With Scissors : Tom Hoppe sent me Augusten Burroughs's memoir for my birthday and I read it this weekend in about 8 hours, straight through.  It's a wonderful read.  Hysterically funny, touching, bewildering and catching the absurdity of youth in a way that I think we can all relate to, even if our parents aren't Anne Sexton wannabes.  I don't much care for "funny books," as you all know, but this works for me because it's essentially in the form of short stories (there is no real chronology to events, and trying to piece one together based on the ages he asserts at various times left me feeling retarded).  The reason I keep thinking about this book now though is not so much that it was brilliant (it was) but that Mr. Hoppe said he sent it to me because it reminded him of stories I tell about my family.  Melissa Izzo says that she also thinks it sounds like my family.  I don't know how I feel about this.  My family is nothing like this.  Well, okay, so there are a few pedophiles in my family, and a lot of crazy drunks, and yes I grew up in a house full of crazy people who shit in the sink and swore nonstop in Finnish.  But, I mean, really . . . am I that bad?  4. Dale Peck.  After our conversation a while ago, spurred by Ben's quote from a Dale Peck article, I remembered reading some good reviews of Peck's own fiction, and decided to try it out and see if he has any reason to say Faulkner is a bitch.  So I picked up  urlLink   The Law of Enclosures   as well as his collection of criticism,  urlLink    Hatchet Jobs  .  Peck writes some fucking beautiful prose.  I'm really impressed.  Here is a sample:   Later, after she learned Henry really was dying, and after she learned he would live, she thought that sometimes you walk right into language as though it's a chair out of place in a dark room: a word, an expression you live with all your life can become suddenly, completely unfamiliar.  That night Beatrice stumbled over death, but it was dark, and she was tired, and she believed she had stumbled across love.  5.  urlLink  Gretchen Wilson's  song, "Redneck Woman.": this is something of a guilty pleasure for me.  On occasion I like to switch the radio over to a country station in hopes of hearing something I like.  I used to listen to country exclusively (until High School, in fact) and nostalgia draws me back in.  The fact that patriotism and pop-rock seem to be all that country singers care about these days makes me sad and I long for a return to the days of Country & Western music, when songwriters wrote songs with narrative stories.  Marty Robbins, Hank Williams, Garth Brooks were all great storytellers more than great musicians, and I miss that.  This song is not very good.  In fact it's pretty shitty.  But I just can't help it.  I have a soft spot in my heart for songs for the working class that shout out a big Fuck You to the elitist hipsters who run not only the music world but life in general.  Wilson's song doesn't rise to the level of that great anti-intellectual ode to sweaty "real work" that is Aaron Tippin's  urlLink  "Working Man's Ph.D."  but it does feature this delightfully sexy and proud line (about fancy lingerie): "Still look sexy/as sexy as those models on TV/I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me.  You might think I'm trashy/a little too hardcore/but get in my neck of the woods/I'm just the girl next door."  What is best about my obsession with this song is that it is apparently the most popular song in the history of country music ever or something and is on any time of day on at least one of the three country stations I can find.  This makes it surprisingly easy for me to indulge in a little trashy good fun.

      This is bound to be the weirdest double review of movies I've ever done, but I can't help it.  This weekend, after seeing   Mystic River , I watched   Hiroshima, Mon Amour  and   Saved!   Some thoughts on   Hiroshima :  I refuse to write much on this movie.  Every dumb postmodern, postcolonial college student in America has lavished bad prose on this movie, and I feel silly adding my own.  I was impressed by some of its themes, even if I think it doesn't quite work.  The opening passage was marvelous, the quiet scenes of something-like-love were moving and tender.  The story she tells of her life during the War was heavy-handed and awkward, and failed to resonate.  The overwhelming weight of Hiroshima itself was oppressive, and not in a good way.  The movie seeks to explore the space in which individuals become history, and run from history, and drown in it.  I think it doesn't work, because the politics is too heavy, and their "ordinary" lives too extraordinary.  That doesn't mean the overall impression of the film, the aesthetic impression, isn't one of beauty.  The fact that the pieces don't quite fit gives it a sort of awkward, manic energy that lies just under the calm surface.  The tension holds each shot suspended in contradiction, and makes for an emotionally engaging artistic experience.  So, perhaps this is a movie that, although it clearly   has  a "meaning," we should probably pretend that it does not, and just enjoy the ride.  Some thoughts of   Saved! :  So, I enjoyed this movie.  Note that I didn't say I liked it.  The jokes were funny at the time, but in retrospect I can only remember a couple of them.  Jena Malone is more charming than she has ever been, though still somehow a little too whiny for me.  Mandy Moore was excellently bitchy (and, I think, brave to take the role.)  Macauley Culkin has become a beautiful and creepy man.  In every smirk he reeks of an aging pedophile trapped in a pretty blond body.  It gives him a certain dirty charm that liberates him to be interesting on screen.  I've never been a Mac-hater, and I thought he managed to almost make   Party Monster  watchable.  This role is beneath him, I think, in that it's too easy.  He manages to subversively play off of the subversive stereotype he plays in a way that makes his scenes not excruciating, and his chemistry with the Satan loving Jew-girl is actually the most interesting thing in the movie.  The problem of this movie is its message (so maybe there is a similarity between it and   Hiroshima ) which intrudes too heavily.  In satire we get the message without having to be told what it is.  This is actually true of all art, but particularly satire.  The message of   Election  does not need to be shoved at us in the form of melodramatic prom-night speeches by gay fugitives and pregnant girls who think it's a good idea to jump up and down 7 days before they are due.  Nor does good satire have to go out of its way to give us deep characters with real motivations.  The biggest contradiction in the movie is the serious tone of Jena's storyline, as she grapples with real issues that are interesting and the card-board cut-outs who fill in for the "good Christians" at the school.  This movie could have been a biting satire, or a serious view of the contradictions and hypocrisies inherent in Christian youth culture, or a moving psychological drama about a girl trying to deal with being a mother at 17.  It can't be all three at once. My favorite character was the girl who had been saved from being a brutal heathen savage in Vietnam.  My favorite scene was the scene from the Lifetime Movie starring Valerie Bertinelli as a cancer patient.  My only real question afterward is: why did Mary-Louise Parker's hair have to be a different color in every scene?  This movie is fun, in a totally mindless way, if you're willing to suffer through the final fifteen minutes of lectures.  It's simply too innocuous to hate.  Sure it doesn't work, and is only passingly funny, but who cares?  Christian rock bands are funny.  So enjoy it.

So I try to make some selection sometimes from the fast food chain of, like, what I think might be nutritional." -- Tiffany Barron, stage mother, having just ordered a No. 5, a No. 10 and a No. 10 at Taco Bell.   Personally, I've always thought that refried beans and easy cheese are healthier when squeezed into a burrito than they are dripped over corn chips or stuffed into a fried taco, so I applaud Barron's choice of a No. 5, when many less-conscientious parents would go with, say, a No. 2 or a No. 6.

      But in addition to this disturbing craziness (and other typical cult tactics, including encouraging his deputy, who now heads UPI, to use baseball bats on cult members who were "sleeping or hiding,") there is also hilarity:  Do you like the smell of your husband's semen? Answer to Father. Does it smell good or bad? You may not like the smell of your wife's stool, but do you smell your own? Why don't you smell your own but you smell your wife's? Because you are not totally one.  The King of Peace also  urlLink  owns a gun manufacturing company.   Baseball Bats and Firearms are the Weapons of Peace.  Also, in case you didn't know,  urlLink  every dead President of the United States has been born again through Reverend Moon.   Here are a few of their testimonies.  Thomas Jefferson:  People of America, rise again.  Return to the nation's founding spirit. Follow the teachings of Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Messiah to all people, who has appeared in Korea. There is no inconsistency between our founding spirit and his teachings. Well-known presidents and kings from history are excited by the greatness of his philosophy of peace.  James Madison was down with it, too:  There is something that people must fulfill for the sake of their eternal lives in the spirit world.  All the people of America must follow the teachings in the Unification Thought and Divine Principle of Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who is the returning Lord in this age and the Messiah.  Don't forget Honest Abe:  People of America, people of the world! Black people are children of God, as are white people. At some time, all of you will have to gather here in the spirit world and walk side by side and live together. I simply came here and experienced this fact before you.  Dwight Eisenhower chaired the event, while FDR offered a prayer and Nixon sang a song.  All this was made possible by a Unification Divine Principle Seminar that God was kind enough to sponsor, according to Silent Cal Coolidge.  Although I am glad to see our fallen leaders embracing Rev. Moon's truth, I am sad to note that death apparently robs them of their talents as writers.  They all seem to love exclamation points and lines such as: "Heavenly Father, I am Eisenhower!" and "People of the United Nations, I am John Kennedy!"  The full text of their statements is  urlLink  here .  For a rundown of fantastic Moonie articles, visit  urlLink  Rick Ross's cult page.

       urlLink  Salon covers the coronation of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon as King of Peace by members of Congress.   It seems that the leader of the largest and most famous international cult, and owner of several newspapers and the UPI wire service, Sun Myung Moon, has friends in Congress who gave him a giant bejeweled crown and declared him the King of Peace and the Second Coming of Christ.  This alleged King of Peace claims to have  urlLink  saved the souls of Hitler and Stalin  and that Jews brought on the Holocaust through their betrayal of Christ. He also implies that Hitler did good work because, by causing suffering to his victims, he increased their chances of Salvation.  This is followed by the cryptic, but creepy, phrase, "What if True Father [Moon] used Hitler's tactics, gas chambers etc." As part of his plan to unify all religions, he preaches that crosses must be torn down from Christian churches and that Jews should sign a pledge for repentance for killing Christ.  In fact,  urlLink  after the Jews failed God , God declared Korea to be the Second Israel.  Why no Korean knew this for 1900 years is not important, really, is it?  The King of Peace also hates gays.   urlLink  Gays are "dung-eating dogs,"  who should be purged in a bloodbath greater than "any Communist purge, but at God's orders."  And, in a strange act of unification, his strong supporters include Republican stalwarts (Senator Lindsey Graham of SC, etc.) and a fairly big array of leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Elijah Cummings.  Harold Ford, Jr. -- who challenged Nancy Pelosi for the Democratic leadership post -- also appeared on the flier, but claims he didn't know about the event.  It seems that at least some of the Congressmen were tricked into attending the event, which was billed as an awards ceremony for peace activists from their home states.  But a good number of them know exactly who Moon is, and exactly how absurd and crazy this whole "coronation" was.  They gave a crown to a man who has proclaimed that he is the true king of earth and that the Constitution should be abolished in favor of "Godism."  Many of them, rightly embarrassed, pretended they were not there until Salon's reporter kindly provided them with photos showing their presence.  You can find more Moonie madness at the links I've provided, and the article that sparked Salon's investigation appears  urlLink  at the Gadflyer.

      Michael Newdow  urlLink  pontificates in Slate  about the parental custody system.  Newdow is concerned about this because the Supreme Court rejected his challenge to the Pledge of Allegiance on the grounds that he was not a legal guardian for the child in question.  Newdow is in a protracted, and vicious, custody struggle with the girl's mother.  Newdow's statements on child custody (presented rather tamely in this piece) reveal his drive to use his daughter as an extension of his egomania.  He rejects the entire notion of "the best interests of the child" in favor of a more or less absolute right for each parent to have 50% of the time with the child.  This shifts the burden of family courts from protecting children to protecting parents.  Although it might decrease the number of custody cases, it is chilling to see a man declare that his rights as a parent override his daughter's interest in all matters.  His challenge to the pledge is just an extension of this.  Since the Supreme Court allows a student to opt-out of the pledge, and since the child in question is being raised as a Christian by her mother, it seems unlikely that Newdow can claim any real harm was done to his daughter.  He wants to bring the suit simply so that he can be the man who brought down the Pledge.  Like Michael Moore, and Judge Roy Moore, Newdow is another showman, seeking a quick minute in the sun at the expense of truth, honesty and decency.  Unlike the Moores, though, Newdow has chosen to use his daughter to further his personal grievance against her best interest.  Remember that this is the  urlLink  same man  who wrote "under protest" on each one of the child support payments he made to his ex-girlfriend and who claimed that she forced him to have sex with her so that she could trap him into marriage.  He has agreed to represent in court any man who claims to have been "tricked" into fatherhood.  He evicted his ex-girlfriend and daughter on 30 days notice after fighting with the girl's mother.  For the first several years of the girl's life he introduced her and the mother as "My friend Sandy and her daughter."  So -- it's traumatic for a girl who is being raised as a Christian to hear "under God" in the pledge, but it's not traumatic for her to be evicted from her home by her father, or have him claim that he was "tricked" into being her father?  He is selfish, arrogant and ruthless in his crusade to use his daughter to achieve his grand plan for a secular society.  The fact that none of the things he rails against are in violation of the First Amendment, that none of them cause substantial harm to atheists, and that his daughter is   not  an atheist doesn't matter to him.  A few other fun Newdow facts: he tried to sue President Bush because a clergyman at the Inaugural mentioned Jesus.  He has tried to remove In God We Trust from money and tried to ban to practice of congressional chaplains.  All of these instances fall under what the Supreme Court calls "ceremonial deism" and not actual national establishment of religion.  He is also an ordained minister with the  urlLink  Universal Life Church , a church that allows you to become an instant clergyman online.  He joins such other illustrious ULC ministers as Joey Tribiani, Ben Hasler and Tom Hoppe. He also has his own "church" called the First Amendmist Church of True Science (FACTS).  Indeed, the Tom Paine of our time.

      So, I finally watched   Mystic River .  It was even more disappointing than I imagined.  Mostly because it had so much raw potential to be moving and challenging, and in the end just wasn't really much of anything.  Although he's not Sam Peckinpah, Clint Eastwood has a body of work in which violence plays a major role.  Overall, Eastwood has cranked out some fairly interesting films about violence (especially taken as a body of work.)  From his acting work all the way through   Unforgiven  and   Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil , his movies haven't been outstandingly great, but they've been good.  The problem with   Mystic River  is that it tries to do everything.  In the end, it fails at each of them in turn.  Here are the movies Eastwood is trying to make, and why they don't work:  1. Mystery/thriller: the storyline plays out like a particularly dull and thoughtless episode of Law and Order.  The entire plot is more or less obvious from the moment Emmy Rossum becomes a beautiful corpse.  Everything was inevitable (and not in a tragic sense, see notes below) because no one involved in the writing of this project seems to have any imagination.  Everything rolls out like clockwork, and what could have had the potential to be an interesting, and convoluted, whodunnit just becomes another case of "the least likely" suspect turning out to be the killer.  2. Greek Tragedy: Or should we say Irish-American tragedy?  This movie attempts to build a strong tragic arc, but doesn't understand what tragedy is.  Tragedy is not just a bunch of fucked up people whose cycle of violence/fuck-uppery leads to their eventual downfall.  Tragedy is not having your daughter killed, or being raped as a child, or growing up without a father, or any of the other things that the pop-psychoanalysis of this movie thinks it is.  Tragedy is about a person who lives in a society with strict regimentation and rules, who violates those rules and who dies for that violation.  It requires a society that is dedicated, without question, to a core set of values (usually religious), and almost always requires that the characters be kings or other mighty and powerful personages.  Trying to craft a tragedy (or, as Dennis Lehane also calls it in the making of documentary, further displaying his ignorance of genre, a "street opera") out of the lives of ordinary people who live in a postmodern society with no serious and impenetrable belief in destiny just isn't going to work.  This kind of transposition of tragic ideals can only work as parody, not as "serious drama."  3. Psychological Examination: This strain of trying to figure out what's going on in all these men's minds runs counter to the tragic element discussed above.  One of the basic tenets of tragedy (and another reason why the tragic sensibility is so inaccessible to us) is that it is   not  psychological.  Characters do not have motivations, they are not even, by modern standards, characters at all.  They are stand-ins for virtue and vice, aesthetic creations of a time before psychology.  There is never an attempt to understanding why the events happen, or how these events impact that psychologies of the characters, because how and why do not matter in tragedy.  Choice is irrelevant, will is irrelevant, all that matters is the tension between social/divine order and the individual who transgresses.  So, how can a film that hopes to be a psychological tragedy possibly be anything but a mess?  The characters aren't that well drawn, we don't get that deep into their psychology (the contradictions necessary to make them plausible would be too difficult for Eastwood, I think.)  And yet he does not allow us to view them from a distance, that is from the safety of impenetrability.  If we were allowed not to have to think about the psychology of grief, or rape or any of the rest of it, we'd be able to see a movie in which people act for reasons we can never understand, and perhaps then we'd be able to find some kind of aesthetic meaning here.  The best characters we have are the two wives (I refuse to count Kevin Bacon's wife as a character, because the entire premise of this untalkative, undeveloped wife figure was only added to make sure that Bacon's character had some kind of inner-torment.  Trying to match that against Tim Robbins's shambling rape victim and Sean Penn's raging, grieving father is obnoxious and idiotic), but the only reason for this is that Eastwood clearly has so little interest in women.  The female characters are forced into the background, though still being crucial elements of the story.  It means we don't have to listen to them give monologues about how they feel -- we see how they feel, we see how they act and have to either figure the motivations out for ourselves or abandon that analysis in favor of admitting that we can never know why they do what they do, the fact   that  they do it is enough.  There are still a few images and scenes that I found to be beautifully executed.  One was the scene in the funeral parlor where Sean Penn lays the dress over his daughter's body.  The image was haunting, if blandly executed, and Penn's understated grief worked far better than the Howling-To-The-Heavens-Macbeth Act he won the Oscar for.  The final speech by Laura Linney, the only real appearance of her character   as  a character, was marvelous.  The loyalty, passion, sexuality and cunning she revealed seemed to come out of nowhere, but also seemed just right.  This is the finest scene in the film, and one that Dennis Lehane says was left out of the original screenplay until he insisted it be put in. Marcia Gay Harden's devastated wife was great to watch as well, though less compelling (it seems the more we see of the characters, the less interesting they become.  Thus Kevin Bacon does the best performance among the men because he has the least to do.  Tim Robbins is not a good actor, and his Forrest Gump-with-an-edge routine got old after about, oh, 24 frames.  Sean Penn, a monumental actor, the perfect man for this part, gives in to all the worst instincts an actor can have for this kind of role.  I have always found wailing grief implausible, and Penn's efforts are forced and mechanical to boot), she still managed to capture the fragility of her character, caught between conflicting moral loyalties.  She is the closest thing to a truly tragic character we have in the film.  Overall, this was thoroughly boring filmmaking.  Competent, for certain.  It was never exactly terrible, but it tried to do too much and so couldn't manage to do anything really well.

      Ben  urlLink  calls me a gorilla  and then  urlLink  apologizes .  I can already tell that Ben's career as a sportscaster is going to be quite short lived.  However, I think there are a number of reasons I should be proud of being compared to this slain ape.  1. I hate children.  Jabari eats children. 2. If I was a gorilla no one would care that I am ugly. 3. If I was a gorilla no one would care that I am fat. 4.   Congo  was a rad movie.  Also that one where Sigourney Weaver got killed. 5. Much like Jabari, I am often motivated by "fear, anger or desire to breed."  So, no worries Ben.  I don't hate you anymore than I already did.  And I probably won't be calling you a monkey (I hope you realize that Jabari is not a monkey, but an ape) anytime soon, because as you know [and as mentioned in the Ben Stiller post below] I have a certain fetish for ape- and monkey-lookin' dudes.  And I do not have a fetish for you.

       urlLink  Oregon City doctor bills state health plan for his innovative pain treatements  on a woman with the mental capacity of a 12 year old.  These treatments include using his penis to "massage her pressure points" which are conveniently located in her vagina.  Adventist Health Care fired the doctor immediately upon learning of his little plan.  Says the press flack: "This is not a standard of care we find acceptable."  I like how sexual abuse of a patient is now a "standard of care."

      Heaven annoys me.  Specifically it annoys me when people who should know better (i.e. Christian fundamentalists and Ann Coulter) talk about how so-and-so is "in Heaven."  Ronald Reagan is now "in Heaven," for instance.  Of course, he is not in Heaven.  Only God and the angels are in Heaven.  The bible is pretty clear on this.  Here are a few subtle clues as to the fate of man upon death:  "No man hath ascended up to heaven" (John 3:13).   "David is not ascended into the heavens" (Acts 2:34)  "The dead know not anything ... Their love, their hatred, and their envy is now perished" (Eccl. 9:5)  "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Gen. 3:19).  "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them" (Heb. 11:13).   "The Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels: and then shall he reward every man according to his works" (Matt. 16:27)  This is a reference to the fact that when Jesus comes back he will rise us up out of our graves and judge us.  This is why when my grandfather died, my grandmother had to meet with the priest to determine if cremation was okay.  I mean, if you burn up Grampy's body, what is going to rise out of the grave during the Rapture?  These facts, which should be well-known and obvious to Christians who have studied their fucking text, can be found at this  urlLink  website.   I'm getting tired of people pretending that their poor dead mother is in Heaven, when in fact she is rotting in the grave.  I happen to believe she's just rotting, but even if I were a Christian, at best I'd be able to say she's rotting and waiting in dreamless sleep for the Rapture.  It may be comforting to imagine a place on unimaginable bliss awaiting us, but in fact we can't get there until after Earth is destroyed by Armageddon.  No wonder Reagan was so eager for the End of Times.

      Here is Ann on Nancy Reagan's support of stem cell research:  But you can't blame Nancy. As everyone saw once again last week, she's still madly in love with the guy. She'd probably support harvesting full-grown, living humans if it would bring back Ronnie. Of course, I thought it was cute and not creepy that she consulted an astrologer about Reagan's schedule after he was shot. That didn't make astrology a hard science. But liberals who once lambasted Nancy for having too much influence on Reagan's schedule now want to anoint her Seer of Technology.

      Ben claims that  urlLink  Michelle Malkin  is the new  urlLink  Ann Coulter .  Ben is a heretic and will perish at the stake.  1. Yes, Ms. Malkin is hot.  She definitely has the whole porn star thing going for her, with her hair all blowin' back in the wind and her mouth slightly open.  You can practically taste her pussy-juice already can't you?  She's maybe even hotter than Ann.  But who cares?  2. Ms. Malkin only seems to write on two topics.  One is immigration/terrorism -- the same thing in her mind-- (on which she basically steals her positions and her style of writing about them from Ann Coulter, only minus the jokes and the most egregious right wing craziness -- in short, she's shrill AND boring.)  The other is female sexuality and how it must be destroyed.  Even Ann doesn't go that far.  If you read Malkin's pieces of Courtney Love and Washingtonienne, the overwhelming sense is one of moral outrage that these women actually use their vaginas for something other than giving birth and having clitorectomies.  Oh, not that I'm defending Courtney Love, who is obnoxious and gratuitous and ugly to boot, but imagine what Ann Coulter would say about her and then compare it to Malkin's self-righteous bore-fest.  Now, I understand why Ben has a boner for her.  He hates immigrants and he loves to fetishize Asian women.  That is cool.  But to compare her (favorably) to the amazing source of wonder and beauty that is Ann Coulter will not be allowed to stand.  When you actually compare them, it is clear that Ann is the more rabid, mouth-frothing Right Winger and the one with a sense of humor.  And, may I add, where is Talking Michelle Malkin Doll?  That's right.  There isn't one.  So, you can eat Ann Coulter's hepatitis-free shit, Michelle Malkin!  Ain't no one gonna displace my Ann from her pedestal as Hot Right Wing Babe.

      So . . . the 9/11 commission says that Cheney more or less acted on his own in giving the order to shoot down the hijacked planes.  I suspect a number of people will react by saying this just proves that Cheney is the real power behind the throne (including the fact that Josh Bolten had to remind the VP to call the Prez.)  There will also be criticisms of the fact that Cheney and Bush both told the commission that Bush gave the order, which seems to be unverifiable.  I'm not sure why they want to make it seem that Bush gave the order, perhaps to tone down the fact that Bush was just zooming aimlessly around on Air Force One.  None of this bothers me really.  The Vice President clearly was acting under his authority in the absence of the president.  President Bush was doing the only thing he could in such an emergency, staying the hell away from danger.  In fact, if anything, I may be offering what amounts to the first words of praise I've had the Vice President in a good deal of time.  He acted decisively, without hesitation, to protect civilian life even if it meant doing something that was quite unthinkable before that day.  Had we had better intelligence I have no doubt that Cheney's order could have stopped the attacks on the WTC (had he been alerted earlier that the planes had gone off course.)  In retrospect, this is the obvious order to give.  Just as it is the obvious course of action for passengers to rise up against the terrorists.  But all that is hindsight.  On that morning would Joe Lieberman have given the same order?  Would Al Gore?  Would even other Republican possibilities (Danforth, Ashcroft, Racicot, Powell, Lugar etc)?  Of course, this isn't meant to imply that simply because of this order (which changed the course of events not in the least -- especially as it never reached the pilots, who thought we were being attacked by Russia) we should be grateful for four years of terrible leadership from Bush.  What it does mean is that Bush picked exactly the right person to be one-breath-away from the top job.  Vice Presidents are almost always chosen for political reasons, and are often unqualified for the presidency itself.  We should remember that as Kerry ponders his running mate.  Edwards would be a great running mate, politically.  So would John McCain.  But do we want either of these men in charge if Kerry's out of town?  McCain has his virtues, and Edwards sure is handsome, but I fear McCain might be to eager to reach for the button and Edwards too shy.  I think Kerry's best choice would be Gephardt, even though that means I'm backpedalling on my earlier insistence on a Southerner.  I'm not sure how much of the South Edwards can swing, but I think Gephardt would put Ohio into play and possibly solidify Democratic holdings in West Virginia, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania.  Even Missouri might tilt in favor of its hometown boy, though I doubt it.  Gephardt, more than his political uses, would be an excellent president should anything happen to Kerry.  Though, Edwards is nice to look at.  It would be nice to have a handsome person running around the White House . . . .

      then I'm sure  urlLink  David Edelstein  and  urlLink  Charles Taylor  would have liked   The Terminal .  Some particular nastiness from Taylor:  When was the last time you saw a contemporary woman deliver a "Stay away from me -- I'm bad news" speech? Did Steven Spielberg get his ideas about women from Susan Hayward movies? . . . "The Terminal" is probably the worst-directed film Spielberg has ever made. A peculiarly rhythmless piece of work, it seems to go on forever, though nearly every one of the scenes is cut off before it has been dramatically developed. . .[Spielberg] has proceeded in a style and tone utterly inappropriate to the material. Is every script Spielberg attempts from now on going to have to be worked up to be worthy of him? His hero isn't the only guy stuck in no man's land.   Edelstein is a little kinder . . . so I won't bother to post his comments.  Kindness is of no use to me.

      Ben is mean to my boyfriend, Ben Stiller.  I can't really find a way to defend Ben though.  I mean, criticisms of him are usually accurate, with the exception of the morons who thinks he's ugly.  But, I have a bit of a monkey-man fetish.  I won't deny it.  Ben carries a link to  urlLink  this discussion  of Stiller's career.  The funniest bit of this is Tara's response to Sarah questioning why Ben voices Thomas Jefferson in the (totally fantastic) PBS show   Liberty's Kids :   If you don’t picture a short, somewhat simian Jewish dude when you think of Thomas Jefferson, then I guess you’re not much of a patriot,  Sarah .  I think it is good of PBS to admit that Jews had a great deal of impact on our Founding.  If we finally admit that Thomas Jefferson was a tall, grey-eyed, red-headed Welsh Jew then we can finally admit that the Jews are responsible for slavery.  Solves a lot of problems, don't it?  Thanks, Ben Stiller!  ps: I haven't seen an episode of the show with Thomas Jefferson (though I have seen Benedict Arnold, Ethan Allen and, of course, Ben Franklin who is the sort of surrogate father of the Liberty's Kids, though I suspect he may be their real father as well) so I don't know the answer, but who else thinks nothing could be better than hearing Ben Stiller do a Virginia Gentry accent?

      So, I am bored and I looked up the other quizzes made by the person who made that 80s toys quiz and one is this  urlLink  Famous Artist Quiz  which is remarkably easy to manipulate.  I won't post my results (I am Georgia O'Keefe) because I cheated to get Georgia O.  The reason was that the Georgia related answers were the best.  For the question "You're hungry, what would you like to eat?" one answer is "your pussy."  I'm not sure Georgia ate her OWN pussy . . . but man did she make vaginas look pleasing to the eye.

       urlLink  Truth.com ads.   I mean, okay, I'm a smoker.  So maybe I'm biased.  But I really, really hate this shit.  In a recent ad a woman approaches a man and says "Do you have the time?" and he tells her and she says "Oh my God.  I hate to tell you this, but a bunch of people just died."  It's so manipulative.  I guess they think they are "shocking" people into not smoking, or perhaps that they are putting tobacco deaths into perspective.  Of course, the numbers they use are probably exaggerated.  Although tobacco certainly does kill, I'm not convinced that casual exposure to second-hand smoke is as dangerous as they claim, or that every case of heart disease or lung disease in smokers can be laid at tobacco's feet.  But even that's not the point.  THIS is the point: don't these little fuckers have anything better to do with their time?  They obviously have a great deal of activist energy.  It could be directed in all kinds of directions.  Racism, sexism, homophobia, fighting for workers rights, fighting for fair immigration laws, fighting against far more terrible polluters like SUVs or factories.  Instead, they dress up as rats and run around in subways and make idiots of themselves.  Drooling idiots.  It's totally embarrassing to watch or to hear this shit.  I mean, do you really find meaning in educating people about the dangers of cigarettes?  Do you really think that you matter?  No one cares about you (except maybe your tight ass and perky tits) so get the fuck off my TV and leave me in peace.  Oh yeah, and that ass of yours needs douched.  Now THAT'S the truth (dot com)  ps: please go check out their little website and count how many times they use the word "kooky."  Kooky.  Wow.  Kooky antics really make me realize that I'm killing myself slowly. The only words of sense on the whole thing are this bit from a concerned theTruth.com viewer: "you guys, pardon my french are stone cold morons."  Truth, yo, Truth.

      And my wrath knows no bounds.  After the guys at Slate failed to mention my boy Bill, I began obsessively searching for references to Faulkner as a Modernist.  There are a ton, but almost all are dedicated only to him.  In general discussions of the movement he does not appear.  However, there are some particularly egregious slights that I can't let rest.  Let us begin at this  urlLink  "encyclopedia"  which mentions luminaries like Joyce, Woolf, Pound, Eliot and also obscure artistic figures like Wallace Stevens but no Faulkner.  I might let them get away with them except for the following hideous passage:  In Great Britain a youth sub-culture even called itself "Modernists", though usually shortened to Mods. In popular music Bob Dylan combined folk music traditions with Modernist verse, adopting literary devices derived from Eliot and others. The Beatles also developed along these lines, even creating atonal and other Modernist musical effects in their later albums. Musicians such as Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart proved even more experimental.   So, what I'm to take from this is that Vespa-riding, bad-haircutted Brits and Frank fucking Zappa count as significant parts of the Modernist movement but William Faulkner doesn't?  Jesus Christ.  There is a conspiracy at work here.  I intend to root it out.  I will see how high this goes.  If Secretary Rumsfeld approved this, there will be hell to pay!  But no, my dear friends, it gets worse.  Worse than Frank Zappa.  Behold  urlLink  this article from the same source  on a key Modernist literary technique, and one Faulker is famous for, stream-of-consciousness.  Again, Woolf and Joyce figure prominently, as they should.  But so does Jack Kerouac, another writer I'd prefer have been aborted.  But that's fine, too.  I mean, whether or not I think Jack Kerouac is the laziest, most idiotic, least profound, sorry excuse for a man of letters of his generation doesn't mean that encyclopedia writers might not be impressed by his lame attempts at meaningful work.  No, no.  What bothers me is yet another passage which elevates modern pop rock musicians over Mr. Faulkner:  Contemporary singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette is also well-known for her employment of the stream-of-consciousness technique, in songs like All I Really Want, The Couch, and I Was Hoping. The album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie signifies this method of writing.  Now don't get me wrong.  Alanis is a fine songwriter, and her songs do, indeed, employ this Modernist method (perhaps better than any other contemporary songwriter).  But, I just can't really think that "All I Really Want," good as it may be, really deserves a mention in this encyclopedia when   The Sound and the Fury  does not.  I mean, maybe Faulkner just had to write more about going down on dudes in a movie theater, or give his kids dumb-ass shitfucking names like "Moon-Unit Faulkner," or something.  I don't know.  What I do know is that this is a serious travesty.  I mean, it's not like these people have no idea who he was.  In the entry on him they mention Modernism and stream-of-consciousness and refer to him as "widely thought of as America's finest novelist."  They even have an entry suited for  urlLink  Ultra Faulknerds  on Yoknapatawpha County which includes the population information Faulkner made up for it.  So, what I have to say to everyone who is ignoring the great novelist (and screenwriter) is: What the FUCK, motherfuckers?

      For those who are perhaps unaware of the significance of June 16, it is the day in 1904 on which Joyce's   Ulysses  takes place, and is thus named for his character, Leopold Bloom.  (It could, I suppose, just as accurately be called Dedalusday, after the other character, and Joyce's more frequent stand-in, Stephen Dedalus.  But that name is dumb.)   urlLink  Joyceheads go crazy  worldwide, but especially in Dublin.  I'm not sure why they love him so much in Dublin, since he hated Ireland.  "How sick, sick, sick I am of Dublin! It is the city of failure, of rancor and of unhappiness. I long to be out of it."  Anyway, I've not yet managed to actually read the entire length of the "greatest novel ever" as it is often called.  Still, today allows us to reflect on literature, and on Modernism in particular.  Since we went through this all last week (though mostly relating to films, which bear almost no resemblance to novels) I am not particularly eager to get back into it.  That being said, Slate promises an interesting  urlLink  e-mail exchange  between novelists Jim Lewis and Jeffrey Eugenides.  So far there is only Lewis's first entry, and I won't comment on it except to say that I was pleased when he proposes a ban on the use of footnotes in literature, and displeased when he makes no reference to William Faulkner, who was America's first Modernist, and who puts the form to its best use.  Oh well.  I suppose if I had my way critics would ONLY talk about Faulkner, and only to lavish him with praise.

      Susan Sontag is, admittedly, at her best when building a case out of works she admires.  Still, her ironic savagery can be deeply satisfying, on the rare occassions that she's willing to bring it out.  Here is a passage from her essay "Going to theater, etc." In which she discusses a production of   Hamlet  directed by John Gielgud:    The production affords exactly two pleasures.  Hearing John Gielgud's voice on tape . . . and the excellent George Rose, in the brief role of the Gravedigger . . the rest of the performances gave only various degrees of pain.  Everyone spoke too fast; that fault apart, some performances rose to the height of mediocrity, while others, like the performances of Laertes and Ophelia, deserve to be singled out as particularly immature.  It might be mentioned, though, that Eileen Herlie, who does a perfunctory Gertrude, gave a striking performance in the same role in Olivier's movie.  And that Richard Burton, who does as little as possible with Hamlet, is indeed a very handsome man.  Correction: he plays the whole of Hamlet's death scene standing, when could have sat down.

Her voice cuts through all the crap, seeking, and even finding, what she calls "an erotics of art" to replace literary hermeneutics.  4.  urlLink  Louise Gluck , poet laureate of the United States, and especially this poem:  "Siren"  I became a criminal when I fell in love. Before that I was a waitress.   I didn't want to go to Chicago with you. I wanted to marry you, I wanted Your wife to suffer.  I wanted her life to be like a play In which all the parts are sad parts.  Does a good person Think this way? I deserve  Credit for my courage--  I sat in the dark on your front porch. Everything was clear to me: If your wife wouldn't let you go That proved she didn't love you. If she loved you Wouldn't she want you to be happy?  I think now If I felt less I would be A better person. I was A good waitress. I could carry eight drinks.  I used to tell you my dreams. Last night I saw a woman sitting in a dark bus-- In the dream, she's weeping, the bus she's on Is moving away. With one hand She's waving; the other strokes An egg carton full of babies.  The dream doesn't rescue the maiden.   5. Deschutes Brewery's  urlLink  Obsidian Stout.   Mmmmmmmm.  Beer.

      More scathing brilliance from Susan's essay "Sartre's   Saint Genet ":   "The Marquis de Sade dreamt of extinguishing the fires of Etna with his sperm," Sartre observes.  "Genet's arrogant madness goes further: he jerks off the Universe."  Jerking off the universe is perhaps what all philosophy, all abstract thought is about: an intense, and not very sociable pleasure, which has to be repeated again and again.  It is a rather good description, anyway, of Sartre's own phenomenology of consciousness.  And, certainly, it is a perfectly fair description of what Genet is all about.  ps: this is especially for Ben, who I know loves him some filthy-assed Jean Genet.

       . . . I think I probably have to agree with Tim on the specific case of   The Manchurian Candidate.   I'm a little concerned about this one.  First of all, I can't figure out the plot based on the trailer, which I suppose is good since it's a thriller and all.  But it's clearly radically different from the original film (in which Angela Lansbury's son is brainwashed to kill the president and make her husband president so she can rule the world) -- it appears here that someone else is brainwashed to kill someone and make HER SON president.  Why this seems lamer to me is that it lacks the same kind of force (her son is to kill her husband) that makes Lansbury's character so interesting to watch (instead of just being evil.)  The Lady Macbeth element seems pared down in this version, which is sad, because I think Meryl Streep can do wonders with it.  What else is lame, is that the movie works too hard at updating the material.  Either material translates into a new time period or it does not.  If it does, why mess with it?  I think of Baz Luhrmann's   Romeo + Juliet  as a good example.  The material translates effortlessly, so why go to all the trouble of letting us know that the brand of handguns they use are "Swords," and renaming the Prince as Captain Prince, the policeman?  Almereyda's   Hamlet  has a problem too, which is that they change Denmark the country into The Denmark Corporation.  It's too strained.  They work so hard to get us to suspend disbelief that we can't suspend disbelief.  The Manchurian Candidate addresses a similar problem just as poorly.  Since the brainwashing occurs during the Gulf War, we are left to wonder "So why is he the   Manchurian  candidate?  Why not the Mesopotamian Candidate?" So they create a brainwashing company called the Manchuria Corporation to solve the problem.  Lame.  And if the original was about Communists, then what is Streep's character in this version?  An Islamic fundamentalist?  A Baathist?  Then there is the Hillary issue.  This is almost too dumb to address.  First of all, I love how much time someone spent  urlLink  finding stills from the film and comparing them to photos of Senator Clinton  just to show us how alike they are.  In one case, they aren't even making the same facial expression (Senator Clinton is smiling at Gerald Ford, Senator Streep is sort of mewing at Denzel Washington).  Someone has too much time on their hands.  Meryl Streep looks like Hillary Clinton.  It's true.  They have a similar nose, a similar facial structure, the same eyes.  Then they give her the Hillary haircut.  So, big deal?   urlLink  Blanche Lambert Lincoln  has the same 'do.  So does  urlLink  Mary Landrieu .  It has become the standard political lady hairdo, with its combination of femininity and professionalism.  This isn't quite Emma Thompson in   Primary Colors , people.  The idea of editing a movie to take out an actress's gestures that might look like Senator Clinton's is dumb.  Especially because there is a reasonable chance that Meryl Streep's performance is the best thing in the film, maybe even the   only  good thing.  So they're going to butcher her performance just so we don't see her making "hand gestures" that look like the Senator's?  Who runs the studios these days?  Brain-stem babies?

      Tim hates remakes.  The link to his comments on   The Manchurian Candidate  appears below.  I have a more ambiguous relationship with remakes.  In a general sense, I have no problem with them.  We've long accepted the validity of "remakes" of plays (if not, none of us would ever have had a chance to see   Hamlet ), and I see no reason why the mass-media nature of cinema means we have to give up on the idea.  What makes a great film is the perfect storm of players involved, from actors to directors to writers.  That can't be replicated easily, and I agree that many remakes are lazy and idiotic, but that doesn't mean it never happens.  Pierluigi and I both love   The Good Thief , which is as intelligent and brilliant a remake as I can imagine.  Of course, it improves on its source material, which helps, but beyond that it manages to have something to say about art and to be a moving experience in spite of whatever expectations we may have from Melville's   Bob le Boring Movie.   I know that everyone, myself included, hates Gus Van Sant's   Psycho  remake, but I also find something artistically fascinating in the idea of trying to replicate a film shot by shot with new actors.  It's interesting, at least, which has some value in an of itself.  Tim is especially disturbed by remakes of movies he likes.  I understand this.  It's difficult to get over one's love for a movie and try to accept a change in it (the same is true of covering songs by other bands, or when Bo was replaced by new-Bo on   Days of Our Lives ).  But do we really want remakes of bad movies?  Pierlugi's boyfriend Frank Whaley suggests that we should in his IFC rant, in which he says that someone should remake   Swing Kids  as a movie about dancing midgets who aren't Nazis.  Although, I really want to see dancing midgets, I don't know if I agree.  Admittedly, my favorite remake is   The Good Thief , which is a remake of a terrible movie, but it's also a remake of a "classic" movie, therefore one that at least someone must like.  What about   Ali: Fear Eats The Soul  and   Far From Heaven  which are both remakes of   All That Heaven Allows?   What about Cronenberg's   The Fly ?  Great films can be remade as great films.  There is no question of it.  Our knee-jerk reaction toward remakes says far more about our prejudices than it does about remakes.

       urlLink  Tim gets into it just as we all get over it.   I have only a few comments to make here.  I haven't seen the Coens' "Hollywood comedies" because I hated their arty independent movies.  But that being said, I don't think Pierluigi's arguments are that offbase.  To view a film, as Tim claims, solely on its own merits is a high and noble ideal.  It's also bullshit.  To do so would require that you can magically forget everything you've ever learned about film.  It would require you to be able to view a movie in a kind of intellectual and artistic vacuum that is ruined, at the very least, by reading reviews of a movie before you see it, and is certainly ruined by having seen other movies.  In fact, if Tim lived up to this imaginary ideal of judgment, he'd have no problem with  urlLink  remakes  because he'd be able to judge them solely on their own merits, not on the films that came before them.  But of course, we can't do this.  So, if we concede that we are able to judge movies in the context of their style, their history, their relationship to other works in a bigger, theoretic sense, then where can you draw the line?  It's as valid to compare   Intolerable Cruelty  to   Cheaper by the Dozen  as it is to compare   Happiness  to   In The Company of Men , or to compare Soderbergh's    Solaris  to both Tarkovsky's and   2001 .  Movies are not made in a vacuum.  They are created in a specific time as part of a larger system of filmmaking.  To admit that, and act on it critically, isn't wrong.  It's honest.  Ben compared   Saved  unfavorably to   Mean Girls  because they are in the same general genre of film.  Was that wrong too?  In fact, he even compared the Coens' work to Preston Sturges's because they work in the same genre.  The state of criticism (particularly amateur criticism like ours) has reached a point where we want to have it every way possible.  We want to be able to read countless reviews of movies before we see them and then we want to pretend we're viewing them with fresh eyes and without bias.  We want to protect movies we like from the ravages of remakes and rip-offs, but we want to "judge a movie on its own merits."  But we can't have our make-up and eat it too, as John Waters would say.  In fact, we don't even have a choice here.  We have no chance of viewing art in pure, Platonic Ideal isolation.  Therefore, comparative analyses (both positive and negative) are almost the only way we have of making sense of a piece of art, other than on a purely aesthetic (and unwritable) level of enjoyment or disgust.

      Having spent a good deal of the last few days savaging Mr. Eggers and his "movement," I think it's important to turn my roving eye on his critics.  Please go read the nonsensical proto-Communist ravings of the  urlLink  Underground Literary Alliance.   The Manifesto reads like something Ted Kaczynski might have written had he gotten tired of environmentalism and moved on to literature.  Oh, they have some good points.  But they speak incessantly of the "professionalization of writing."  They act as if successful writers of the past were not professionals with the luxury to write instead of work at real jobs.  They also wage yet another attack (as does Dale Peck and so many other critics of contemporary literature) against "style" which they see as inferior to "content."  In fact, much of what they write, about living among "real people" and about the glories of poverty, seems to be a manifesto in favor of a specific style: namely Socialist Realism.  They pose as injured geniuses harmed by the stifling influence of Franzen, Eggers and Moody, defeated by the "credentials" system of good writing, when their actual manifesto declares openly that they seek to Stalinize writing.  Art must serve the people, they declare, and forget that art has no such duty and that nearly all art that does is bad. And of course, it all comes down to money.  The ULA writers didn't get Guggenheim Fellowships to write their shitty zines, therefore the literary establishment is "corrupt to the core."  My, this self-righteous indignation sure does keep us warm at night, doesn't it?  This is another problem lit crit must face.  When our choices are between smug, self-serving idiotic prose and brutal, uninspired, authoritarian prose we have reached a pretty pass.  So, that being said, I guess I should shut up and write a novel.  Then I'll show Eggers and the ULA both who deserves to punch whose nuts the hardest.

      I realized, while reviewing my various comments on the Lit Boys, that I give the impression that contemporary fiction is both monolithic and entirely male dominated.  Neither is the case.  "Contemporary fiction" includes a lot of writers who are not such egregious jackasses, though most of them are older.  This is a big part of why I'm not that concerned for the future of the novel.  I have yet to find any great young writer who is really moving the form forward, but enough who are still working in forms that are delightful.  Not everyone is Dave Eggers, afterall.  Still, there is another trend in fiction that should be disturbing to anyone who loves books.  Increasingly there is a vast divide between "men's fiction" and "women's fiction."  Oh, there has always been a gap, but for much of the twentieth century women have loomed large right alongside their male counterparts, generally writing within the same movement.  There was Willa Cather right beside Faulkner, Woolf alongside Joyce, Highsmith alongside her hard-boiled male contemporaries, Morrison next to Roth.  But now there are two definable literary movements.  One is the Lit Boy, tongue-in-cheek, deeply unserious vision we've discussed already, and the other is the equally smug and pomo-influenced, but usually less "funny" and more "meaningful" brand of women's fiction we see dominating the other side.  I've read less of these works, since they are more relentlessly marketed (from Oprah to Kakutani) and therefore more mindnumbing.  I happen to think a few of these women are good, or at least far better than Eggers et al.  Sheri Reynolds, whose brilliant novel   The Rapture of Canaan  managed to be both daring and tender, funny and solemn, is best known as one of Oprah's stable, and is therefore too easily dismissed.  She writes gloriously fine prose, and tells stories that are worth reading.  Most women's fiction is of the bland, nearly-plotless kind that seeks revelation and epiphany above all else (following in the footsteps of Virginia Woolf, whose   Mrs. Dalloway  is virtually the only novel of this sort worth reading) and ends up being monotonous.  There are men who work in the same vein, especially gay ones.  Michael Cunningham has written one great novel,   The Hours  (which is, surprise surprise, an inspired and intelligent send-up of Woolf's Mrs. D), and a good one,   Flesh and Blood , but all of his works are overlaid with this fundamental seriousness of intention.  David Leavitt writes manically brilliant short fiction, but his novels are dry, relentless and pomo.  Still, the greatest successes in this world of inner-turmoil are women.  And even when women rebel against this strain, the effort is usually, well, strained.   urlLink  Slate's Book Club  has an interesting e-mail exchange that does a better job than I of hashing out the problem's with the Lit Girls (because they've read them more consistently for one).  My main concern here is that I find it a little depressing that men's fiction is written so clearly for a young, hip, male audience and women's fiction so clearly for a slightly older, more serious, almost spinsterly set of women.  I think few women find Eggers very charming, whereas many women find the far more "macho" and "manly" Ernest Hemingway to be so.  I think few men want to read   The Jane Austen Book Club , even though many men like Jane Austen.  Although the majority of novels are written in the shared space that has always existed, and likely many future classics are brewing there, as yet unnoticed, the two most exemplary literary movements of today (and movement in the shallowest sense of the word, since both "movements" are just the death throws of dying literatures) are unabashedly gender-specific.  Willa Cather would not be amused.

       urlLink  Pierluigi's keyboard drips poisonous sarcasm , directed at Ben's film school lecture.  Of course, Pierluigi is wrong to believe the Coens are good filmmakers, but I will allow him his little fantasy, because his witty posts make me laugh.  And, more importantly, in his spirited defense of the Coens, he manages to reveal the real problem with them.  Ben and I have both talked about the Coens as trying to subvert film genre (which they clearly do) for their own ends.  But what we've missed (well, Ben alludes to it with his talk of Chandler) is that the Coens' overwhelming influences are not other filmmakers (as is the case with Tarantino), but hard-boiled fiction writers.  Their films are too heavy-handed in a literary sense, and seem to leap into the book vs. movie fray decidedly on the side of books.  Of course, the genres they are working with are pretty literary anyway, and I certainly don't want to imply that I believe there is, or should be, a strict division between the literary and the filmic.  Still, the bookish Coens fail to fully materialize a movie aesthetic, either in honor of or in reaction to their predecessors, much less in an original sense.

      I took a cheap shot at Tarantino and have opened a  urlLink  can of worms .  The comment I made about QT was unfair -- both to him and to Eggers.  There is no real correlation between the Lit Boy Problem and any filmmaker or group of filmmakers.  There is, in fact, no general malaise and collapse of filmmaking in any way comparable to what's going down in book land.  Which is not to say that there isn't a similar situation cropping up with certain specific filmmakers.  Similar, but not identical.  I don't want to spend much time on this, as I want to take a nap, but briefly here are my views on both Tarantino and the Coens.   urlLink  Pierluigi takes care of the broad strokes on Tarantino.   The only thing I can say in his defense is that he seems to mean well.  His movies are a drawn-out love letter to cinema.  The fact that I find all of his films boring, idiotic and brutally offensive to my aesthetic sense does not change the fact that he loves movies, and that shows, and maybe that's even okay.  His basic innocence and naivete work to his advantage.  Criticizing Tarantino is a little like criticizing a retarded person.  Even if it must be done, it doesn't feel good.  Criticizing the Coens, on the other hand, feels fucking awesome.  Ben makes a strong case that their game has deteriorated.  The last of their flicks I saw was   The Man Who Wasn't There , so I'm not as up to snuff as I should be.  Wait, maybe O, Brother came afterward and I did see that.  Whatever.  It's all the same to me.  I disagree with Ben and Pier alike that the Coens were ever very good to begin with.    Fargo  is a masterpiece.    O,Brother  is a solid exercise in literary allusion and fun shenanigans.   The rest of it is just one solid blur of bad movie.  I really want to like   Barton Fink , because of its Faulkner references, but just can't bring myself to (despite the valiant efforts of Judy Davis to save the picture.)  Other than that, I can't even accurately distinguish one movie from another.  The Coens wield irony like a bazooka and quirky humor like a sledge hammer.  Their style is reduced to those two things.  My aren't we ironic and quirky?  Irony is a powerful tool, and is best used as little as possible, and should always be subtle.  Quirky, dark humor can be used more liberally, but only if the quirkiness serves a greater purpose (which is not to say a greater message, but merely a greater aesthetic system).  Humor should never be a justification for its own existence.  The Coens don't seem to realize that.  To say that their new works are "more Hollywood" or "less energetic" is to miss what has been blatantly obvious from the beginning: subversion of genre can only get you so far.  Eventually you have to make something that is really your own, that speaks in a loud voice and that stands for something.  The Coens stand for nothing.  They lurk behind the projector, hunting their next victim for an ode/subversion, squealing like delighted suckling pigs when they produce their next indie masterpiece of American irony.  Perhaps, finally, people are beginning to realize that these clowns don't have a distinctive style or a definable aesthetic theory or mission.  Their films lack both style and content, and as such are as empty as a piece of art can possibly be.  In addition, they have committed the abominable sin of foisting John Turturro on us in unspeakably bad role after unspeakably bad role.  And that, loyal Fagistanis, is indefensible.

      Ben carries  urlLink  an attack of Eggers's "literary journals"  and  urlLink  a bit of Eggers-love.   As an inveterate foe of all that Eggers stands for in the world of literature, I have more to say.  Of course.  But specifically, I have something to say about Dale Peck's full-scale attack on American literature.  First of all, it's clear that Peck doesn't have a very clear grasp of literary movements.  He refers to Moody and his ilk as "the highest of canonical postmodernism . . . a bankrupt tradition ... that began with the diarrheic flow of words that is 'Ulysses'; continued on through the incomprehensible ramblings of late Faulkner and the sterile inventions of Nabokov."  Joyce, Faulkner and Nabokov are not postmodernists.  The novels of Joyce and Faulkner are more or less the standard by which   Modern  Literature is judged. Post-modernism makes a much later appearance on the scene.  I'll ignore his comments on Joyce, because I've not read The Great Book itself.  But, surprise surprise, I find his attack on Faulkner to be misguided.  Much of Faulkner's "late" works are actually more accessible than his early works.  The least comprehensible of his novels is   The Sound And the Fury , which was his first major work.  The attack of Nabokov is even worse, but reveals what kind of prey Peck is after.  Of all writers in the canon of great literature, Nabokov is the most aesthetic and the least "content-driven" (to borrow from Sontag.)  His demeanor, and his work, defies analysis on the grounds that lit crit demands.  He has no "message" about the human condition or class warfare or gender relations.  Reading Nabokov is to give up on all of that nonsense, and experience art as a purely phenomenal and aesthetic creature.  What Peck means by "sterile inventions" is "it doesn't    mean  anything!"  As if books have a duty to give us some kind of message.  Peck's fight is not a fight against any real bankruptcy in literature, but against style.  Peck is right to attack the Eggers crowd for their reliance on an awkward and highly self-conscious style (the stylization of their own hipness), but he seeks to somehow divorce style from content, and therefore finds particularly galling any writers who lack what he might think of as "content" and who opt for style.  Or perhaps, even more galling, are writers like Joyce and Faulkner whose marriage of content and style (the two are not, in fact, different at all -- again, borrowing from Sontag) is more or less perfect.  That doesn't mean that Peck doesn't still manage to diagnose the problem with most of the Lit Boys (the exception, I think, is the great Michael Chabon).  It comes at the end of his list of the "postmodernist canon" in which he actually manages to identify some postmodern writers -- namely Barth and Gaddis.  I don't like Barth.  He's too smug and funny for my tastes.  Still, his books are inventive and brave.  They struck out wildly against the edifice of Modernity that had grown stale by the 1960s, in the same way that other writers I don't admire (Pynchon, Burroughs, Mailer) did in their own ways, and that some I do admire (Ginsberg, Roth, Morrison, Sexton) did as well.  The problem is, that their howling, spontaneous attack against a literature that was smothering them has produce its own smothering mass of imitators and poseurs.  Just as Bret Easton Ellis has taken Faulkner's searing, radical style and turned it into something that seems somehow stodgy and predictable, so have Eggers and Wallace taken Barth's style (funny, hip, smug) and turned it into something boring and false.  Instead of writers bravely striking out to find a new voice, we are left with the most obnoxious remnants of outmoded styles.  Peck is wrong in that he sees the Lit Boys as the culmination of a century-long collapse of literature, but he is right in that literature is in desperate need of a new movement to save it.  The problem is: I'm not sure it can happen.  As film emerged somewhere in the 60s and 70s as not only an artform that could be taken seriously by critics, but also as the major narrative art in America, most of the men and women who 50 years ago would have been writing books are now making movies.  This is great for film (although isn't Tarantino really the cinematic equivalent of Dave Eggers, throwing together a pastiche of other styles without finding his own voice?) because it has become the medium in which experiments can still happen, and in which a tremendous amount of great work is being done.  But it leaves literature with less and less.  Just as the novel stole an endless number of geniuses from poetry, so too has film stolen endless geniuses from the novel.  One of the worst excesses on the Lit Boys is the heavy-handed used of typographical shenanigans to make their books "look cool."  It's as if the film has invaded the book so far that we can no longer remember that books are made up of words and not of images.  We must make the words   look like pretty pictures  and then call this "daring" and "bold" narrative creativity.  I think the novel can be saved, but I'm also not that concerned.  All I want is for young writers to stop worshipping at the altar of the Barth-Eggers-Wallace Temple and start WRITING again.  Or stop writing and go make a fucking movie, and leave the world or words undisturbed.

Here she is, dissing my man Ingmar:  . . . a few of the films of Berman -- though crammed with lame messages about the modern spirit, thereby inviting interpretations -- still triumph over the pretentious intentions of their director.

       urlLink  Ben finally gives Liz Phair some love.   I've liked her new album since it came out.  Not only am I not ashamed of it, but I think that people who have dismissed it as an excercise in commercialism should be ashamed of not being able to listen to a fucking record and shut their dirty mouths.  Sure, it's not   Exile  . . . but what the fuck is?  Imagine if we made that album the standard by which all others that came after were to be judged.  How many would pass muster?  Maybe two or three.  Maybe.  What it is, is a brilliant subversion of the pop form by Liz's distinctive sensibility.  She doesn't have a strong enough voice to carry off a full-blown pop sensation, and the tension of her slightly strained voice laid on top of happy nice pop sounds is brilliant and far darker than she's given credit for.  Sure there's a lot of throw-away stuff here, but there's also the old cynic at work.  "It's sweet how you believe you're in love with me . . ."  "Your record collection don't exist/You don't even know who Liz Phair is."  There is also a good deal of fun here.  Liz has always been funny, and many of these songs lack the darker undercurrents that made the previous albums so great, but it's still there.  She having fun being a woman in her 30s with a kid who still has great sex.  "I wanna play X-Box on your floor . . . " and of course, the rollicking and infectious "Hot White Cum" which both embraces and makes fun of her potty-mouth reputation, and is the sweetest pop song on the whole disc.  The difference between Liz Phair and Avril Lavigne is that Liz is able to take the material that others are writing and turn it around into something that is distinctive and clearly of a piece with her entire body of work, while passing it off as "pop rock" and letting "Why Can't I" and "Extraordinary" have their little day in the Top 40 sun.

      In a comment to my post "Sigh" below, Ben writes "Indians?  Aren't we talking about Native Americans?"  Well.  I think   Ben  was talking about Village People.  I'm talking about Indians.  And I'll tell you why.  1. I've never met an Indian who calls himself a Native American.  And I've met more than one. 2. Native American is no better a description, and in many ways a worse one, than Indian.  Both words/phrases imply a solid racial coherence to the peoples of the Americas.  This racial identity was established by Europeans for European purposes.  Native American is intended as an antidote to the stereotype loaded Indian and as a way to reclaim native legitimacy.  As such, it's all well and good.  But the fact is, that although it helps clear up the confusion as to which kind of Indian we're discussing (is he from India Indian?) it doesn't solve any other problems.  It still prominently features the European word American, for instance.  And the word native is so relative in this context as to be meaningless.  Indians were in America for thousands of years before Europeans were, but are not ultimately native (although many of them believe, religiously, that they were created in the Americas).  In an individual sense, all native-born Americans are native.  So, what we have with Native American is an attempt to solve problems linguistically.  But Indians won't become empowered because we stop calling them Indians.  Indian or Native American, if they are treated as a culturally homogeneous group with a solid racial identity we are doing them an injustice.  So, I suppose it would be best if we referred to the person in that photograph as a Sioux (which is his tribal identity), and even more specifically by whichever band he belongs to.  But that's needlessly specific.  I am reminded of my father's friend, Long Standing Bear Chief.  Bear Chief is a leader among northwest Montana's Blackfoot Indian nation.  He tried to sponsor a bill in the state legislature entitled "The White Man Relocation Act" so his Indian nationalist credentials are pretty strong.  Furthermore, he once sent my father an e-mail saying that he no longer wished to use his English name (which was Harold) which he had previously used interchangeably with his tribal name.  He wanted to "stop filtering" himself through European culture.  This is all well and good, I suppose.  But impossible.  For one thing, Harold did not revert to native dress, or give up his glasses, or insist that we call him by his name   in  Blackfoot.  It was enough to use the English translation of his name.  I still support his decision to name himself.  But there is no way in which native peoples anywhere in the world can truly retreat from white culture, particularly not in America, where native peoples are so overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of invading Europeans.  The only real question is whether Indians can choose, as a group, to empower themselves within our culture and transform it into a hybrid within which their cultural values can have a hope of surviving.  The battleground is not linguistic, and debating Indian vs. Native American diverts real Indians from the real work they are engaged in.  I'm not trying to be so righteous and serious about this, but I do think it's a serious issue, and one that is basically never touched on in white American culture.  We invade a continent, spread disease, destroy indigenous cultures (intentionally and not), strip them of their land, their religion, their language, push nomadic people onto cramped reservations and then ignore them.  For a hundred years.  Then we go the Rez and we see rusted out cars everywhere, or we see the one Indian in town drunk on the corner, and we forget that all of that is something WE DID to these people, intentionally and without remorse.  We blame them and then go back to our nice, clean, warm, white world and pretend we understand their problems because we buy "native artwork" in Santa Fe and call them "Native Americans."  And don't we just loooove their Casinos?

       urlLink  Salon steals from Wonkette  and doesn't even give her credit.  The article, an examination of the media ceaseless and mindnumbing coverage of Reagan's rather boring funeral services, is entitled "Reagan porn."  It's not that good, really, a rather bland look at the media's surrendering of their duties in favor of appearing not to be "liberal" (though Ann Coulter, in the article I discussed yesterday, claims that liberals are trying to steal his legacy by talking about how "nice" and "optimistic" he was). Still, the article has some important insights, not only mentioning that Clinton was far more popular than Reagan and places higher on polls of "greatest presidents" but also comparing the Reagan death-orgy to other televised presidential deaths, including that of a leader slain while still in office in a nationally televised assassination:    "I'm struck by [the length of] this," Johnson says. "From the time Jack Kennedy took a bullet in the head [on Nov. 22, 1963] until he was buried at Arlington Cemetery -- that was four days of TV coverage. This is a whole week."  That period of time didn't just focus on watching the funeral either.  Lyndon Johnson became president, there was the investigation into the assassination, there was the constant threat of international war.  You know, actual   news stories .  It was a sudden, violent death of a young and charismatic leader at the height of Cold War tensions.  Somehow we managed to move on with our lives after only four days of coverage.  Why do we need a week to get over Reagan?  I propose we tear down the WWII memorial that all the architects hate and replace it with a giant glass mausoleum for Reagan.  Maybe we can have him preserved in some Reaganite pose.  Eating a jellybean, or pushing The Button, or putting people on a Black List, or effusively praising the apartheid regime of South Africa, or not talking to his children.  Various options.  Please send ideas to the newly appointment Secretary of Reagan Affairs, Dan Rather.

      Why do I torture myself, and my dear readers, by  urlLink  foisting Dave Eggers  on us?  Because, once in a while, I think a reminder is in order that this man is by far the most obnoxious and talentless "writer" prancing around in the burning wreckage of contemporary literature.  I'm not as depressed about the collapse of literature as many literati are (perhaps because I love movies, and it's clear that the film has eclipsed the novel as the great American narrative art form) but still, I am depressed when I read Eggers.  Why? So many reasons.  Pompous, weighty, "funny" prose that lacks elegance and wit, to start with.  His unflagging belief in his own hip mastery of cynicism.  Every sentence Eggers writes is orgasmic, in the filthiest, porn-theater sense of the word.  Instead of sitting at a typewriter, it is impossible to imagine Eggers doing anything but jacking off to photos of himself and then smearing the dried cum into words and calling it a "novel in progress" at Salon. Well, just read this and see what you think.  While reading, think of Charles Dickens.  Dickens, the master of the serial novel, the patented genius at naming characters.  His skill at satire was immense and only a very few writers (Jane Austen is the only one popping into my head) can match him.  Here is Eggers mocking President Bush (the first one) and trying to pretend he is Dickens (hell, pretending he's BETTER than Dickens):  Old. He was quite old. She wanted to place her hand on his hands, folded together in his lap like two wilted sea creatures. They looked ancient, his hands, pink and blue and rubbery and yet fragile enough to cleave to the touch.   "You've got nothing to prove to anyone, sir," she tried.   The president said nothing.   "I know you were disappointed in the press coverage last time, and the time before that, but I can say that personally, I know at least a dozen people who were really stunned by your courage. I have e-mails to prove it! I saved a voice-mail message, too. From my college roommate Firoozeh. She was blown away, sir."   The president turned to Ramona Ramone and smiled gently. He knew she was talking to him, but he couldn't hear a word she was saying. The truck was too loud, the road grinding underneath them like a great beast chewing on rocks and gristle.  Former president J. Junior Inferior Sr. was determined to jump once again, from a plane, parachuting from the heavens, this time landing as close as possible to the parking lot next to tonight's debate between the GOP hopefuls. In one fell swoop he would receive the appropriate media coverage for such a feat -- because he was 81, for God's sake! He deserved some "props," as they say (and which he would say when interviewed in his jumpsuit) -- while also proving once and for all that the Republican Party was the more bold and bad-ass and steel-balled of the two, hands down and forever, time eternal. The image of J. Junior Inferior Sr., flush with adventure, standing in his athletic and bow-legged way, with his helmet tucked under his arm, would inspire the party, would bolster his legacy and would create a clear contrast between the representatives of his own party and those of the opposition, who always looked so awkward in boots or flak jackets or tanks.

      Wonkette has issued a response to an Indian who wrote her complaining about her coverage (but not in a too defensive way, as I hope my own response wasn't too defensive).  Here is Wonkette's response to the response:    This is an excellent point. At least that guy (who is a Sioux, not a Village Person) dressed up for the occasion. Most of the people there to view the casket are in shorts and flip-flops -- maybe they're Kerry supporters or something, but if we ran the Capitol, we'd be handing out jackets and ties and turning people away if they had a visible panty line. And, you know, putting a flag on an article of clothing doesn't make "nice." Sheesh. At least they seem to have left their beer helmet hats at home.   See Wonkette, is it so hard to be offensive   and  funny?  No.

       urlLink  Ben carries a link to a Wonkette post with a photo showing a Native American honoring Ronald Reagan .  A couple of things, here.  Why do we have to compare a native American in full traditional dress to a Village Person?  First of all, as is obvious from a simple glance at this photo, the Indian in question has no moustache.  What the hell kind of 70s cloneboy didn't have a moustache?  Not one.  In fact, I saw a show about the Village People and on the audition sign it specifically said: "Must be muscular and have moustache!"  Now, we can wonder all we want why a traditionally garbed Native American has any desire to salute the casket of President Reagan.  Reagan, like all US Presidents, wasn't really that into Indians.  More into, you know, raping and pillaging their land for natural resources.  But why do we have to mock people in traditional dress?  Why does it remain totally okay to make Indian jokes?  I mean -- don't think I don't want people to make Indian jokes.  One of my all time favorite SNL skits involved Heather Locklear as a racist infomercial host saying things like "You couldn't buy this cheaper off a drunken Indian!"  Still -- the problem with this is that, like many Wonkette pieces, it skirts the edge of offensive without even being all that funny.  If there was a construction worker next to the Indian, we'd have a Village People joke.  But one cop does make a village person joke very believable (unless he has a moustache) and one Indian doesn't either (again, unless he has a moustache.)  Instead, all we have is someone mocking an Indian for the sake of a very cheap laugh.  Like Ann Coulter, Wonkette is only worth reading when she's actually FUNNY.  Being offensive and unfunny just don't work for me.  Still, the fact that our society would accept this kind of humor while pretending to be horrified by similar jokes about Africans should be obvious from our general treatment of Indians.  When Senator Johnson of South Dakota led a huge voter registration drive on reservations in an attempt to get native peoples involved he was accused of "playing the race card" and the Republicans spent a good deal of time trying to determine legal strategies for disenfranchising natives.  The Montana State Capitol features a prominent statue of famed Indian killer Thomas Meagher.  But I suppose that since we committed a wholesale genocidal destruction of them, we don't have to be that sensitive to the few thousand who survived.

      I love Tim because he blogs about sports.  I will admit, I'm not that sports minded.  I turn onto baseball in the Fall and to tennis for the Grand Slams, and beyond that it is all just a blur.  Well, that's not quite true.  There is also my faggy love for ice skating and gymnastics.  Tim and Pierluigi have  urlLink  a spat  about political correctness.  I have to err on Tim's side this time.  I have been a relentless foe of the kind of intellectual bankruptcy involved in the "politically correct" movement.  As a pomo homo, I'm willing to admit that language is far more than just a tool of culture -- that untying the two is sometimes impossible.  The problem with political correctness is obvious, though.  It forces us to suppress racist ideology without giving it public expression.  It therefore re-emerges in even less constructive ways.  That being said, people should not be able to use a growing tolerance for racial humor, and a growing dissatisfaction with language-policing, to get away with saying dumb shit.  Why should Larry Bird want more white players?  Would basketball be better off with more white faces?  I don't think so.  Should sports apply the "diversity" standard established in the recent Michigan affirmative action cases?  Probably not.  So why say something like this?  What real argument is being made and why is it being made?  Furthermore, why do public figures say shit like this to begin with?  (even more applicable to the Parcells "Jap plays" comment.)  Remember when Newt Gingrich's mother told Connie Chung that Newt thought Hillary was a bitch?  And then suddenly everyone is shocked when it is aired.  Admittedly, Connie said she wouldn't air it and then, you know, totally did.  It's not so much that we care that Newt thinks Hillary is a bitch.  Of course he does!  It's that we can't imagine his mother would be so stupid as to tell the whole world about it.  Referring to plays as "jap plays" is so patently offensive that no amount of "no disrespect intended" is going to cover it up.  I am reminded of my father telling me that when he was growing up everyone called Brazil nuts "nigger toes."  Even people who weren't Klansmen used the word, because that's what you called the damn nut.  However, if you live long enough the language changes, and you'd best change with it.  No one in their right mind would now think of calling a Brazil nut anything BUT a Brazil nut.  It is one thing to contextualize the statements of people who are dead, and didn't live long enough to learn the newest lingo.  It's another to defend people who clearly know better (or why apologize) and don't do anything about it.  Perhaps if we have a real dialogue about the kinds of racist remarks we find in sports we can get to the root of what are real problems of race in this country and in sports.  Why are almost all coaches of all teams white men?  Even women's teams almost always have male coaches.  What the fuck is the deal here?  We're still willing to employ black men as the powerful core of an athletic team, but not willing to promote them to positions of authority.

      Today is my grandmother's 89th birthday.  She is suffering from dementia but is still in fairly good shape.  A passage from the birthday e-mail sent to us from my Aunt Ginger:    I asked her if she thought that Ronald Reagan was a good president.  She replied that she was so young when he was in office that she really doesn't remember much about him!  President Bush, on the other hand, is hardwired to her brain.  She didn't like him a month ago - and she doesn't like him now.   It's good to know my grandmother is still a Democrat, despite everything.  In reality, of course, the Presidents she was too young to remember would be Wilson and Harding, and possibly Coolidge.  Happy birthday, grams!

      Now, y'all know I love me some Ann Coulter.  But sometimes she is so dumb, even   I  can't handle her.  She  urlLink  talks about the Gipper  and tries to pretend he was as rabidly Right Wing as she is.  She uses his ultra-conservative election year rhetoric as her biggest weapon, mostly ignoring his actual accomplishments.  In the following excerpt, my comments are bracketed.  Reagan was a bulldog, completely, implacably right-wing on every issue. He was the right-wing Energizer Bunny. He never quit and he kept beating liberals. He cut taxes 25 percent across the board his first year in office [and raised them several years later]; he walked away from Gorbachev at Reykjavik [because Gorbachev wouldn't accept Reagan's "Right Wing" plan to abolish nuclear weapons and build a missile defense system to make another buildup impossible]; he fired all those air traffic controllers -- and wouldn't let them come back even when they wanted to [okay, I'll give you that one Ann.  But, in his defense, he was only following the law]; he gave speeches about "welfare queens" [I'll give her that one too.  Reagan's welfare rhetoric was pretty right wing, obnoxious and racist] and polluting trees [okay, so sometimes he was dumb enough to sound pretty Right Wing]; he nominated Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork to the Supreme Court [And Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy]; and he enraged grim liberals when he warmed up his radio mike by saying, "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes." [he was joking] But now they're telling us Reagan was a "pragmatist." Well, not according to him. As he was wrapping up the Republican primaries in 1980 and moderate weenies in the Republican Party were trying to move him to the "center," Reagan said: "No, I'm not moving my positions any. ... I believe the same things that I've been speaking on for years, and I don't see any reason to change." [until he made no attempt to undo the major cornerstone policies of the New Deal and Great Society, until he re-embraced the Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson Containment Theory, until he failed to balance the budget . . . ]  The point here is that Reagan was, at heart, the rabid Right Winger who as governor of California encouraged police to "spill some blood" when confronting protestors, the Right Winger who saw the fiery Apocalypse just over the horizon.  But as President his record is far more moderate.  The president I'd have to compare him most to (and with some difficulty on my part) is Thomas Jefferson.  Jefferson hated government too.  But his government went to war against the Barbary Pirates.  His government sealed off the ports of the nation to keep us from trading with foreign powers.  His government doubled the size of the United States in what was probably an unconstitutional annexation of French territory.  Often in talented politicians who are fiercely ideological, there is a serious gap between what they wished they could do and what they knew they could do.  Reagan is one of them.  And besides, doesn't Ann miss the greatest Right Wing moments of the Reagan presidency?  Where is her mention of his crafty support for both Saddam Hussein and the Iranian Revolutionary Government during the Iran-Iraq war?  Where is her mention of his spreading of chemical and biological weapons to the Iraqi government?  Where is her mention of his sales of arms in exchange for hostages and the illegally funneling of funds to fascist butchers in Central America?  Where is her discussion of his miserable failure in Afghanistan that led to the Right Wing Taliban leadership?  It seems she misses all of his Rightist achievements and dwells over Rightist things he said he'd do but never did.  Worse yet, there is not one funny joke in this column. Ann, what is happening here?  Well, we know what's happening here.  She's being worshipful of course.  Her column begins with "God worked through Ronald Reagan . . . "

      Craig Seligman has written a book on  urlLink  Susan Sontag and Pauline Kael , cleverly entitled   Sontag and Kael: Opposites Attract Me .  I will admit I've never imagined such a side-by-side, but it does make sense.  I am afraid that Mr. Seligman's self-avowed personal relationship and "love" of Kael, and his far less personal relationship with the far more detached Sontag, will color his views against Sontag, whose achievements in cultural criticism in the 60s and 70s stand among the very greatest achievements in the history of art.  Still, should be interesting.  NYT has an  urlLink  excerpt.   Seligman does offer this treat for those who doubt his reverence for Sontag:    When I complain about her, you should keep in mind the caveat Nietzsche proffered once at the end of a (much more bitter) attack on Wagner: "When I use harsh words against the cretinism of Bayreuth, the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don't count compared to Wagner."  The Nietzsche quote comes from his infamous and vicious   The Case of Wagner .

       urlLink  Dahlia Lithwick on O.J. :   The truth about O.J. is that for one brief moment, the law and the media went crazy and had a lot of sex, and gave birth to a vast sprawling beast that ate us all. With the trial over, life, law, and television returned us to our previously scheduled broadcast. It was all just a mistake, really. Let's keep it that way.  She's right of course.  The O.J. trial wasn't symptomatic of anything.  It was aberrant more than anything and reveals nothing about race, or jury-selection, or jury nullification, or domestic violence or legal ethics.  It exists in such a strange place in the intersection of so many American preoccupations (television, celebrity, crime, race, sex, violence, flashy lawyers) that its lessons can't be applied outward to any other case (with the possible exception of the upcoming Kobe trial, which mixes a nearly identical cocktail of issues.)  She's equally right that it's a little embarrassing to remember the intensity of emotion everyone seemed to feel.  I remember that the verdict came down during lunch, and spilled over in to regularly scheduled class time.  We had all abandoned the cafeteria or the outside to huddle together in our favorite teachers' classrooms to await the verdict.  And we went late to our next class and no one seemed to think this was inappropriate.  The fate of this man's life, a fate which effected none of us in the remotest way, had become the center of our existence.  What was wrong with us?

       urlLink  Salon's got the goods.   A great compilation of 18th birthday advice from various "experts" for our favorite twins.  Some excerpts follow.  They are pretty long excerpts because I was laughing so hard reading it that I almost peed my pants and I know none of you want to wade through Salon's ads to read this stuff.  Still, this is only about HALF of what the various people have to say.  My favorite is probably Janice Dickinson because all she did was talk about herself.  But Annie Sprinkle gives the best advice, I think.  Simon Doonan, creative director for Barney's New York:   A twin, as your nearest and dearest confidante, can also be a validator of dreadful obsessions. Nonstop togetherness can lead to a deranged cul-de-sac where all your darkest obsessions (bulimia, big boobs, body-cutting) are validated by each other! It's a sad fact that most celebs end up getting strange at some point, finding themselves in weird cults and whatnot, but from what I can tell, twins are worse off than most. Start hanging out with intelligent, fun, intensely charismatic people. Intimidating people. Perhaps some of that attitude will rub off on them. Why not ring up Camille Paglia, for example, and ask her to come on holiday?  Annie Sprinkle, prostitute/porn star turned sexologist, educator, multimedia artist and utopian entrepreneur:   At this stage in their lives and their careers, I think it would really benefit them to embrace masturbation, to practice reaching orgasm. They need to get comfortable with making themselves feel good on a daily basis, to help them feel prepared to face the challenges of their busy little lives. Personally, I've really come to value the orgasm experience in times of stress and strain. As they get older, the twins will probably become more and more orgasmic, but good masturbatory habits start now.  J.T. LeRoy, novelist band member and associate film producer:   The twins would have to endure a torrid event, a public disgrace, because our society has very set rules. In order to change perception about someone, we need to be seriously shaken, like an Etch A Sketch. Look at Brooke Shields -- she had to do some big fat fucking falls on her face before she could move forward in her career. Their best bet would be to simply disappear for a while. Maybe one of them could break off from the pair and take on a lesbian role (but not with the other twin!) in an edgy foreign film, a role that would really prove some acting chops.  D-Roc, from the Ying Yang Twins hip-hop duo:  Shit, I ain't never had that kind of money like them other twins have. I'm still trying to get that much. The first thing I be sayin' to them: Manage your cash properly, don't spend it all in one place. Shit. I'm still thinkin' 'bout all that money! Be yourself, girls, and the rest will follow. From what I can tell, they haven't ventured out on their own. They always be chillin' together! They gotta get their own thaaang. Keep that wholesome look, and they'll keep raking in the cash. And they should definitely stay off the drugs. Absolutely. Peace out (times two).   Janice Dickinson, judge on the UPN program "America's Next Top Model" and self-described "world's first supermodel":   I'm on a hit show, I'm gorgeous, I feel good, and I'm so grateful to be me ... but wait! We're talking about the Olsen twins here.  I'm the perfect person to give the Olsen twins advice.  My daughter absofuckinglutely loves these girls. In fact, the way for them to really move their careers forward is to have them send lots of free Mary-Kate and Ashley products to our house. Address them to Savvy, my daughter (get my info from the UPN people). Savvy is gorgeous and doesn't really need any of it. Being the world's first supermodel, the only things that matter to me are oxygen, hair, makeup and clothes. Children, dogs and, of course, society come second.  If they were contestants on "America's Next Top Model," I totally think they would win. We'd just have to stack them one on top of another, to make a whole Olsen. You tell all those fucking pedophiles that they are going to have to deal with me, Janice Dickinson. I will kick their asses, cut off their dicks and send them off to Mississippi. They are fucking pigs. Personally, I did not have plastic surgery until the end of my shelf life as a fashion model. Now, of course, I'm totally fake. The other day, a photographer told me to smile, and I said, I AM SMILING! It's the Botox.  I will be their new manager. I'll tell them exactly how to talk, how to walk, where to shop, what to wear, how to get invited to the best fashion shows. And I'll send a mobster after all those fucking countdown-clock pedophiles.

       urlLink  Ben and I make up .  And Ben also post a particularly handsome photo of David Brock.  Tim  urlLink  defends his honor  and joins the fight against me after Ben plays the "enemies of America" card.  Good job Tim.  At least Tim's analysis was rational.  I want to just state for the record that I am denying any rumors of having hosted David Brock in the private residence at the Fagistani Presidential Palace.  We may have had a meeting or two in my back office.  I can't recall.  What I do know is that I issued a presidential dictat condemning  urlLink  Media Matters for America  for being too retarded.  My anti-Brock credentials should not be called into question simply because of an alleged "night of sodomy."  I promise you this, good people, no fluids were exchanged.  Nor were any substantial ideas.

      One of my fave new sites is  urlLink  Underneath Their Robes , written by a woman known as Article III Groupie.  I am an all-around politics whore, but I have had a lifelong fascination and love for the Supreme Court.  The least democratic, most elitist and intellectualist, of American institutions, it is still the most critical to our democratic experiment.  The contradiction alone is enough to make me giddy.  But then there are the Justices themselves, most towering figures of legal thought, brave, brash, sometimes crazy, far more colorful than our elected officials.  Article III Groupie feeds all my most salacious Article III needs.  Although A3G is a Right Wing judicial conservative, I still have to give her serious props for putting together such a thoroughly brilliant site (like Wonkette, only for smart people who love black robes.)  When asked  urlLink  why she doesn't cover state court judges  she answers:  If federal judges are major motion picture and prime time television stars, state judges are actors on daytime soap operas. And just as soap stars don't make the cover of Vanity Fair, state court judges don't make the pages of "Underneath Their Robes."  and then, even better:  As it turns out, Article III Groupie's second reason for not covering state court judges does not require a scholarly exploration of federal and state court parity, nor does it call for a comparative analysis of American and European judicial selection processes. It's actually quite simple, capable of expression in five little words:   State court judges are ghetto.   and finally, after a long list of bizarro state court incidents:  [P]lease accept this explanation of why UTR does not, as a general matter, devote space in its hallowed pages to those penile-enhancement-pumping, porn-addicted, felon-harboring, Bon Jovi fans who can't drive, otherwise known as state court judges.  The same posting includes her casting of a high-school movie starring federal judges (Ruth Bader Ginsburg is Queen of the Nerds, Antonin Scalia is the "Resident Bad Boy").  I totally want to make out with A3G.  No babies though.  I wouldn't want to slow down her certain meteoric rise to the Article III bench.

      I watched  urlLink   Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen   last night.  This was honestly one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.  Things, very strange things, just kept happening.  Lindsay Lohan's fantasy world was very freaky, and the "reality" was hardly less fucked up.  I just didn't know what was going on.  I don't even know how to rate such a movie.  Lurking underneath the flashy editing and special effects and bizarrely hilarious obsessions (card board cutouts of her favorite band, etc.) there lurks a truly terrible movie.  But as it was, I just don't know.  There were certainly a lot of laughs to be had, and Carol Kane was fucking amazing as usual.  Lindsay's tits were huge, as usual.  Lindsay herself was charming and somehow strangely believable, as usual.  Anyway, I could go on at length, but since I really can barely remember what happened to me during that hour and a half, I will simply pass on the two funniest lines.  "Lola" on needing permission to go to New York City alone: "In some cultures fifteen-year-olds are grandmothers.  Nobody gave the permsision for that, did they?"  And then, Lola on chasing her extremely shit-piss-drunk rock-star crush Stu (lead singer of the hilariously named band Sidarthur) through the alleys of New York (this is also the joke that the film's target audience is least likely to get, but I hope all of you do): "Except for all the garbage and cars, it's just like following Heatchliff out on the moors!"

      Ben and Tim talk about   The Village.   I've not seen it, nor, likely, shall I.    The Sixth Sense  was so excruciating an experience for me that I was effectively broken of my M. Night habit before I got hooked.  I haven't seen   Signs  or   Unbreakable  either.  In fact, I forgot   Unbreakable  even existed.  But when Tim mentioned it, it reminded me of one of the finest ideas that my dear friend Clara Lyons ever came up with.  After coming back to the dorms angry at the waste of time and money [and this from the girl, who along with me, saw nothing wasteful about going to see   Superstar ], said:  "I hated this movie, but it gave me a great idea.  I want to make a porno about a girl with an unbreakable hymen."  I can't think of a better use of M. Night Shyamalan's inspiration, really.  And neither can you.

      Tim's got the link to the latest  urlLink  Hitch extravagance  at Slate.  Hitch is mad that Kerry took a cheap shot.  Kettles and pots are like that.  But here's the deal: Hitch is misreading Kerry.  I admit that the line in question "We shouldn't be building firehouses in Baghdad and closing them at home" was a little disconcerting to me.  It gives the impression of isolationsim, of claiming that Bush is wasting money in Iraq that would be better spent in the US.  But that wasn't actually what John Kerry meant.  It's difficult to know, because Kerry didn't bother to explicate, but his body of statements on Iraq make it clear that he didn't mean we should close the firehouses in Baghdad in order to open them in Cleveland.  He means that we should be doing   both at once.   The problem Kerry is pointing out is that Bush seems intent on rebuilding Iraq at the same time he's tearing down America.  Bush, the law and order pol, wants to kill Clinton's COPS program, effectively removing tens of thousands of cops from the streets, including nearly all "community police" officers (the only bastion of hope for an effective and responsible police force we have.)  And yet, he's busy creating an effective police force in Baghdad.  It's hard not to see Bush's priorities as slightly fucked up.  We can have both, and we should have both, and Kerry knows that.  Hitch is willing to say that because domestic politics currently wouldn't allow that money to be spent in building hospitals, or firehouses or community police forces that means it's okay not to try.  That's plausible enough, if cynical and obnoxious.  But what Hitchens doesn't bother to mention is that his favorite cocklover, George W. Bush, is the one major reason that domestic politics is in the state it now is.  It is Bush who is waging the war against American social services, including traditionally Republican versions thereof.  And frankly, I think we could also agree, if we weren't too busy eating Bush's pooper, that Bush hasn't even begun to think about spending a fraction of the money dedicated to rebuilding.  Kerry offers a choice to build firehouses in Baghdad   and  Cleveland, Bush offers to build them nowhere, and suddenly Democrats are terrible isolationists for mentioning it?  And I'll encourage Kerry to stop taking cheap shots the moment George Bush starts running on his own record.  Bush can only say Kerry is a tax-and-spend liberal for so long before they realize that Bush is paying for his little war with Chinese money and that, in the long run, the interest on those loans will fund increased aggression from North Korea.  In fighting Iraq, Bush strengthens Iran and North Korea, does little to increase livability in Iraq, greatly increasing the instability of the US economy with a skyrocketing and unnecessary deficit, endorses greater and greater tax cuts, which require greater and greater deficit spending, cuts effective programs that are proven to work in order to create new programs that are unwieldy, too expensive, and likely ineffective, and then says that Kerry hasn't done anything.  Well, frankly, I'll take someone who has done nothing over someone who has done far too much, with far too little success.  This piece is even worse than Hitchens usually is anymore.  All spark of creative thought, or nuanced ideas is jettisoned in favor of blindly supporting the ineffective policies of the President.  Kerry should have cut that line, or made it clear what he meant [considering the Senator's penchant for over explaining, I'd vote for outright cutting it], but Hitchens took it out of context of the rest of the speech in order to reinforce the Republican Talking Points.  Democrats Want To Abandon Iraq!  I expect better from Hitchens.  Though maybe I should stop having faith in the most faithless of polemicists.

      Urban asked me to put together a list of "political science books" for him to read, or a list of "other books."  I don't know what that means, but since he already claims to read history and foreign policy, I'm assuming he meant fiction (if I'm wrong, let me know, Urbo).  "Political Science" is loose enough of a topic to allow me to range freely amongst subjects, which makes me happy.  Not all the books in this list are of equal quality of writing or intellectual strength or merit, so don't try to ferret out the key to my politics from the list.  A lot of it will read like Poli Sci 101, and I apologize for that.  But you're the one who said "essential."  John Locke,   Two Treatises of Government  Adam Smith,   The Wealth of Nations   Those two books are, for all intents and purposes, the foundation of American government, even though, technically, Smith's book is contemporary with the Revolution.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau,   The Social Contract .  Rousseau's work led to both the French Revolution and the collectivist politics of later generations, and is a marvelous (if somewhat pretentious and historically misleading) book.  Niccolo Machiavelli,   The Prince : The most reviled, yet practical, political manual out there.  Kerry needs to bone up.  John Stuart Mill,   On Liberty : Mill was an outstanding liberal of his day, but in today's world we'd call him a Libertarian, and his paean to individuality is great, if pretty flawed (he says the government can and should ban the poor from having babies, for instance.)  Richard Hofstadter,   The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It  Louis Hartz,   The Liberal Tradition In America  These two texts are generally considered history, and fit in to a very different list on historiography.  Why they are here is not because of their position as two of the three foundational texts of consensus history (the other, Boorstin's   Genius of the American System  or whatever it's called isn't included in my list) but because they map out, in plain language, the basic principles that connect all American politicians except the very fringe Europeanists.  They show that Bush and Kerry aren't so far apart philosophically, despite policy differences, but neither book really exalts that idea.  Hartz's book, in particular, lobs a good deal of fire at the stifling nature of "consensus" that is very important today.  Richard Hofstadter,   Anti-Intellectualism In American Life : this book really is history, and ranges so widely through American culture that it's almost ridiculous to include it here.  But I love Richard and want to cram as much of him in as possible.  The book can be condescending, and gives too little real credence to the populist impulse, but it does lay out the roots of America's surprising disdain of smart people.  Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward,   Poor People's Movements : a great radical antidote to Rooseveltian liberalism.  Slavoj Zizek: all of his works really, but I'm particularly amused and pleased with   Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?   Postmodern Marxism at its best.  Which of course means you gotta read   Das Kapital  by Mr. Marx himself.  And in order for   that  to make sense, a little bit of Hegel (  The Phenomenology of the Spirit ) wouldn't hurt, but now we've gone so far from politics as to be laughable.  David Brin,   The Transparent Society : a great big bomb of a book that blows apart our attachment to privacy with fascinating force.  Dan F. Hahn,   Political Communication , my alleged field of study at Emerson College was this very topic, and Hahn's work is short, easy to read, and wide-ranging -- with the finest discussion of sexual metaphor in politics that you'll ever see.  I hope that's what you were looking for.  As for "other books"  Here are fine works of literature that I find indispensable (in no particular order and the list could, frankly, be a lot longer, but I am already bored of my own damn list):  William Faulkner,   As I Lay Dying : okay, so there is some order.  This is the finest novel written, in my opinion, and should be soaked in with multiple readings over many years.  Gunter Grass,   The Tin Drum : German midgets who play the drum.  Need I say more?  Milan Kundera,   The Unbearable Lightness of Being : for the second time this week I'm going to sound like a really ugly 15 year old girl, but this book changed my life, or at least my view of it, in a profound way.  Flannery O'Connor,   The Complete Stories : gruesome Southern Gothic perfection.  In my very fave story, "Good Country People", a woman's one-legged daughter changes her name from Joy to Hulga because she wants the ugliest name she can find, then is seduced by a man who takes her into a barn and . . .well, you'll find out when you read it.  Virginia Woolf,   Mrs. Dalloway : elegant, passionately transgressive in its simplicity.  If V had written only this one book, she'd stand as high as any other novelist.  So fucking good.

      For those of you not yet aware,   USA Today  has fired Ann Coulter after hiring her to publish daily columns on the Convention.  Unsurprisingly, the paper has also hired Michael Moore to cover the Republican Convention, and he has promised to "work with an editor" so he may manage to actually get published.   urlLink  Here is the column  that was "below [USA Today's] standards."  I can tell you this whole incident is very shocking and disturbing to me.  I mean,   USAT  has   standards?   David Weigel writes about it on  urlLink  his blog.  [thanks Mickey Kaus.]  He defends his paper's decision not to publish the column when she refused to be edited.  This is fair enough.  He says the writing is below the standards of her books.  Frankly, it is not her best work, and if, as Mr. Weigel claims, the editorial changes were simple things like changing the phrase "caged matches" to "cage matches" (and hopefully trying to convince Ms. C to finally stop writing Allah Akbar, when the actual phrase Muslims use is Allahu Akbar), then she seems a little pissy not to go along.  But he also says that the lede to her much dumber column about how evil teachers are ruling the world was better than the one about the Spawn of Satan.  Frankly, both are terrible lines, but at least one of them mentions Satan.  And Mr. Weigel himself refers to Barack Obama as (D-Heaven).  What the fuck is that?  Her canned column is actually pretty funny.  Oh sure, there is all that stuff about the "Spawn of Satan Convention," which is certainly beneath her usual comedy barometer.  But then we get her take on why conservative girls are pretty:  As for the pretty girls, I can only guess that it's because liberal boys never try to make a move on you without the UN Security Council's approval.  Plus, it's no fun riding around in those dinky little hybrid cars. My pretty-girl allies stick out like a sore thumb amongst the corn-fed, no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie chick pie wagons they call "women" at the Democratic National Convention   "Chick pie wagons?"  Now that is political discourse at its finest!  And, on how much she loves bureaucrats:  Support the troops, the signs say, bring them home.  That's my new position on all government workers, except the 5% who aren't useless, which is to say cops, prosecutors, firemen and U.S. servicemen.  I love bureaucrats at the National Endowment of the Arts funding crucifixes submerged in urine so much -- I think they should go home.  I love public school teachers punishing any mention of God and banning Christmas songs so much -- I think they should go home.

      Where do they pick these guys?  Was Magic Johnson really on the Platform Committee?  What was his plank?  Government assistance to help megarich athletes bang a bunch of chicks without getting HIV?  Jerry Springer for Ohio?  I know he's lusting after the governor's mansion, and I konw I have mixed feelings about that, but do we really need him on the convention floor?  But the one I take the most personally is  urlLink  Art Alexakis.   While the people of Aberdeen, Washington still can't decide whether or how to  urlLink  memorialize Kurt Cobain , Oregon is sending Art to Boston.  I couldn't be more humiliated.  Mr. Alexakis used to host a talk show here in town.  It was, apparently, a political one.  But really, it was just him rambling on in his not very enjoyable voice, about how much he hates Bush.  Oh yeah, and playing Everclear songs.  Nonstop.  When their new album came out, he had the whole band on and they just played the record.  What the fuck?  It would be kind of amusing and endearing from a smaller act, but Everclear?  Jesus. "When they saw that I can articulate more than the average rock 'n' roller guy, they wanted me to speak at political events."   At the convention, Alexakis has volunteered to play acoustic guitar at some of the cocktail soirees, celebrity after-hours parties and catered receptions going on in Boston this week.  Here are some of the articulate things he's said: "I'm a contradiction.  I'm tattooed, but I'm pretty middle class."  Or, you know, totally fucking rich.  He's also a "moderate" in favor of universal health care and abandonment of our efforts in Iraq.  Even better yet, he appeared on a television show (I've forgotten which) opposite conservative commentators and came up with this brilliant line: "Why wouldn't I want to be a liberal?  Liberal means you're open-minded."  Actually, liberal means no such thing, but instead describes a specific set of principles and policy-initiatives.  I've met a lot of close-minded liberals (which is more contradictory, since one liberal principle is diversity of ideas), and a lot of open-minded conservatives.  It's shit like this that just proves my Law of Sarandon.  No one cares what Art Alexakis thinks.  Now, should  urlLink  Clay Aiken  endorse Kerry, we've got a story.  Shoud Kurt Cobain rise from his grave and play acoustic guitar at a cocktail soiree, even better.  But, Art, just go back to the Space Room and down a few beers, kay?

      I know I've been rather freewheeling in my commentary so far, but that's because none of it so far has mattered (other than Edwards, fractionally.)  Tonight was the Big One.  And although a terrible speech won't ruin your chances in November, it is the opposition nominee's first chance to speak in primetime to television viewers. The Convention generally gives a big boost to a candidate, and a bad speech can sour that.  Gore's 2000 speech only reinforced his image as both boring and crazy.  Dole's speech in 1996 was boring and a tad nasty, and not at all like the witty Senator from Kansas really was.  Meanwhile, Clinton in 1992 was an outstanding performance, the same with Reagan's 1980 appearance and Bush's in 2000.  So, how did Kerry do?  I don't know.  Kerry is, his friends assure us, "raucous and bawdy."  We could've used a little of that.  Instead we get weak and somewhat arrogant jokes about being "born in the West Wing."  or that hideous bit about johnkerry.com. He turns his mother's virtues into a standard and rather bland reference to equality for women.  He makes intellectual references but tries to hide them ("A famous American novelist once said . . . " implying that perhaps Kerry doesn't know who said it, because, like the President, he only pretends to read.)  Intellectualism is a dangerous stance in American politics, but it can work.  Bobby Kennedy fearlessly and consistently invoked Tennyson on the campaign trail, even using "Ulysses" to calm a shocked crowd in Indianapolis when he announced the death of Martin Luther King, Jr.  But it came off as honest in Bobby.  He read poems and he loved them and so he spoke of them.  I think Kerry might well love Thomas Wolfe (the novelist he alluded to, and not to be confused with the excruciatingly terrible sack of shit that is Tom Wolfe) and so why should he be afraid of it?  And if he's afraid of T. Wolfe's name why not cut the quote?  It wasn't so great anyway.  There was also the almost nauseating re-working of Edwards' "hope is on the way" with the even less thrilling "help is on the way."  Still, there are some skillful anecdotes that show his worldliness and curiosity -- cycling into East Berlin, for instance.  He is also willing to attack, in a way that no one so far really has.  If I were anywhere near undecided, this one line would have had me reeled in: "And I will appoint an attorney general who will uphold the Constitution of the United States."  Yes, people, the very worst thing in a second Bush Admininstration is not Bush, or Cheney or Rumsfeld, it's John Ashcroft.  There is also soaring rhetoric (perhaps too much of it) that I found nice.  His invocation of service in Vietnam, that "we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra," was beautiful in its simple sincerity.  We served, and we know we had no reason to think we'd return home, and so when we did, we fought to change the nation we had risked our lives to defend.  Bush can't say the same.  He's never had to worry about anything in his whole fucking life but where his next bottle of booze was coming from or whether that skanky girl he date-raped would give him herpes.  He shows his true liberal face here too, aggressively showing the government as the tool of good it can be, and seriously questioning our policy priorities.  This part struck me as particularly strong: "I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to send a young person to prison for the rest of their life when we could invest $10,000 a year in Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, a real start to the lives of our children."  He pounds hard on health care, a huge priority to many swing voters, and one on which Democrats almost always have a polling advantage over Republicans.  This issue alone can win Kerry the election.  Sure, I wish he were endorsing truly universal, single-payer health care.  But, what he is offering is bolder than anything we've had since the Clinton health care debacle.  He engaged the President on the FMA when he didn't have to.  He couldn't have skated through without any reference to the dead amendment, but Kerry engaged it despite the risks.  And I'm proud of that.  He also was unafraid to invoke faith, but also unafraid to express it in his way.  Clinton, you'll recall, was very Jesusy, in that smarmy Southern way that is so grating coming from someone we know probably isn't that faithful.  Kerry's faith is more believable to me, if only because it is more reserved and because he embraces a secular state.  Overall, I think the speech will help.  He's laid out serious and wide-ranging policy disputes, but never relinquished the ground he holds as a veteran.  He was strong in his opposition to terror, even if he spoke little about Iraq.  He said we should work with the UN but not be beholden to them.  Is he trying to have it both ways?  The Bushies will say yes.  But, perhaps, he's just trying to find a real middle ground, where we can all work to make a safer world, and where we don't needlessly cast off centuries of international laws in order to pursue our own goals -- goals we can't even explain to our soldiers or to our citizens.  He also speaks about unity in a way that is reminsicent of, say, Bush in 2000.  But Bush can't pull that "uniter not a divider" business anymore. Too few of us believe it.  We've seen how divided Washington is on issue after issue, how willing the President is to pursue policies that have no purpose but to divide (FMA to be only the most recent example).  I will admit that I am not one of those people who claim they "hate negative campaigning."  First of all, basically everyone who says it is lying.  They either mean "I hate when   their  party does it, but when mine does, it's cool," or they mean "I fucking LOVE it!"  Negative campaign advertising, if not too far out of bounds, is always a net benefit to a campaign.  Which means that I sincerely hope John Kerry plans to break his promise about playing nice.  How many undecideds were won over tonight?  Who knows, though I took a little AOL poll earlier, in which Kerry and Bush have generally been locked in a close, if unscientific, statistical deadheat.  After the speech, the number saying Kerry would be a better president shot up to 63%.  That's a bounce.  Now we just have to counter Bush's bounce, which will be harder, since Bush has a major funding advantage due to his later convention date.  And just keep in mind, people, Kerry is always best in the home stretch.  By the end of August we'll see the Kerry who came from far behind to win Iowa and New Hampshire, surprising even his strongest supporters (read: me), the Kerry who managed to beat back a major assault on his Senate seat by the wildly popular Bill Weld in 1996.  I'm not worried.  We will win on the first Tuesday in November.

      After wallowing in a mire of ads for John Kerry, Fagistan's little ad bar now has an ad for a band called the Fue.  I don't know anything about them and under "contemporaries" they list "foo fighters" so I don't think that sounds promises, however, here is a blurb about  urlLink  their EP :  "The Fue's post-grunge high-octane style connotes whiskey, cigarettes, and race cars."  Fagistan also connotes (and drinks and smokes) whiskey and cigarettes.  Let's make out, The Fue.  I won't give you mouth herpes again.

      Dear John Edwards:  I just want you to know that should unfortunate circumstances or a hateful God strike Elizabeth down, I am here for you.  I will hold you in my arms and sing you lullabies.  Then we will make out.  I love you.  I just covered three whole notebooks with the words "Mrs. Vice President John Edwards" and then switched to "Mrs. President John Edwards."  Please write me.  I am so wet for you right now.  Love,  Joshua, President of Fagistan   ~~~~  I know that during the primaries I was often somewhat mean to Mr. Edwards.  I stand by all those mean things.  His basic assets are his superhot good looks and his oratorical power.  This speech may not be Bryan's "Cross of Gold" but it is pretty rockin.  It has moments that don't flow and so it isn't as rhetorically polished as it could have been.  But he did all he had to do and more.  He cast the debate about his career in populist terms.  He vowed to wage war on Al Qaeda until it is destroyed.  He vowed to unite America.  He managed to talk about class issues, and potentially vast increases in social service spending, without sounding too angry.  His anger was directed at injustice and beautifully wrapped in a kind of soaring optimism that makes the phrase "Class War" seem irrelevant.  He is not waging war against the evil rich, he is merely asking them to make the same sacrifices the rest of us are, and vowing to fight to make sure that we all have access to basic services.  He was particularly strong on the war issue, promising to do what Bush has not done.  Modernize the military to fight contemporary wars more easily.  This was no wimpy Dukakis moment.  The only real question left is how Kerry will do tomorrow.  I'm nervous for him, but hopeful.  Oh, the only part of Edwards speech that I didn't like was the "tell them hope is on the way" bit.  It was nice in terms of rhetorical repetition, and probably sounded better aloud and filled with Edwards particular brand of New Male emotionalism, but it's also cheesy all fuck.  I mean, if your mom calls up to say that she can't afford her heart medicine this month is "Hope is on the way, Ma," really going to make her feel better?  I guess it made that old lady in   Spider Man 2  feel better, but Edwards doesn't need to take his ideas from comic book action movies.  He is exactly four hundred and eighteen thousand times hotter than Tobey Maguire will ever be.  Vive le Vice President!

      Sometimes Andrew Sullivan is such  urlLink  a catty bitch.   I realize I am too.  I'm way worse than him because he's a "professional" and smarter than me.  And he usually restrains it to appropriate venues.  But then we get his fisking of Teresa and he doesn't even bother showing any kind of restraint.  He goes out of his way to bend her words to fit his notion of her as crazy-foreigner.  She needs to write him a terse little e-mail.  Dear Andrew,  Shove it!  Love, TSFHK  He mocks her speaking in several languages because some of them are not that commonly used in America, namely French and Portuguese.  So, just because there aren't as many speakers of those languages as Spanish, she should only pander to big swing voting groups?  Sullivan is essentially saying that because there aren't that  many  Portuguese and Brazilian immigrants, the language when used is just to make her looks smart.  And that because there aren't that many French speakers (and we hate the French anyway, though I'm not sure how Sully feels about Francophone Africans), well, you get the idea.  I agree that Teresa's cosmopolitanism has its drawbacks, I'm not sure this is one of them.  Then Teresa says something that is neither strange nor obnoxious nor difficult to understand and Sully has a meltdown.  Here is what TSFHK says: "He believes that our voices--yours and mine--must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she."  Sully responds with: "To whom does the word 'she' refer to? Freedom? Are we speaking French again and attributing some kind of feminine gender to a noun? Or are we making another pompous feminist reference? I have no idea. But I doubt a single one of her listeners understood what she was trying to say."  This line might be funny if Ann Coulter had gotten ahold of it.  As it is, Sully is either incredibly ignorant or intentionally trying to make Teresa look crazy.  The "she" is obviously Freedom, and to ascribe femininity to Freedom is hardly "pompous feminism."  Perhaps Andrew forgot his first trip to New York City.  Last time I checked, the Statue of Liberty had tits.  Freedom, like Justice and Britannia, is traditionally depicted as a woman.  Teresa's syntax is awkward, it makes it sound like the "she" might be John Kerry himself, but her reference is clear and very ancient.  I can't imagine why he even bothered with this bit. Perhaps it was so that he could throw in another snide French remark.  Not to mention, TSFHK is, "the classic hyper-rich liberal female."  Hyper-rich liberal wasn't enough for Sully.  She's a   female , too.  Damn, them vaginas are scary.  I'm disappointed that Sully, who rightly sees diversity as greatly important, would stoop to such grotesque and explicit Eisenhower-era rhetoric about a woman.  All he had to do was cut one word from his precious little essay and he'd have been fine, but he had to go for the ovaries didn't he?  Sully, it hurts me when you do things like this.  Your writings on the Convention have been wonderful.  Now this.  Teresa didn't even   need  a fisking.  She doesn't particularly like public speaking and her role in the campaign will likely continue to be quiet, short speeches and one-on-ones with undecided voters.  She will speak to them as she always has, as a mother, a wife, a woman with work to do and a world to change.  She'll speak to them in English or Portuguese or French as she must.  She will always be blunt and sharp-tongued and slightly mysterious.  After watching wide-eyed, hypnotized Laura Bush for four years I'm ready for a glamorous, European soap opera star.

      They've published a "Lusty Survey" of men.  It reveals many startling facts.  80% of men would rather get a handjob than masturbate.  In other HJ news, nearly half of men say the key to a good one is "mixed stroking techniques" while a third say it is "using her free hand to play with my balls."  4% of men like to fantasize about a different sex act while having sex.  8% of men like to pretend their girlfriends are hookers.  There are also so many good tips, like how to criticize your man without just out and saying it.  I love that they play into my passive aggressive side.  For instance, if his mother still does his laundy you should "Mention that laundry doesn't have to be a drag, especially when you can get busy on top of a vibrating washing machine."  If your man likes to eat appetizers he is sure to be kinky.  Guys who like golden labs love to be "one-on-one with a woman."  If he prefers pugs he is into "superfreaky sex" (so if he's into pugs   and  appetizers, watch out!)  Men who would love to play the stand-up bass (for some reason the electric bass isn't an option) are domineering in bed and you have to relinquish control to them.  Keyboardists like sex toys.  Greatest Headline Ever: "She Had Her Rapist's Baby."  Good sex advice: Don't "blow" during a blow job, unless you want to see his hilarious reaction when you treat his "manhood like a tuba."

      I am reading the August issue of   Cosmo  right now.  They have an interview with Keira Knightley, who I don't particularly care for, but who appears to actually be kind of charming and funny and not pretentious.  Some highlights:   What's something about you that's very British?   "I haven't had my teeth straightened . . . when I was in L.A. people were like 'Wow, your teeth actually aren't that bad."    What do you do for fun?  "I paint and draw, but very badly.  I also take bad photographs."   What's something you'd like to change about yourself?  "I'd have longer legs and bigger tits."    You looked pretty voluptuous in   Pirates . . .    "The cleavage was painted in.  It was amazing.  I took 45 minutes every single morning for the bloody makeup artist to paint it in.  It's all about shading."  On those pesky lip-job rumors: "Jesus, I mean if they had been accusing me of wanting to get a boob job, I could understand that.  But my lips?"  And she's kinda slutty: "A guy in the Glasgow airport came up to me and said, 'I'm really sorry, but can I kiss you?'  I let him."    I'm sure you made his day.  "Maybe he made my day."

      Teresa was not as good as I had hoped, giving a somewhat clunky and not that inspired, or perverse, speech.  Ted wasn't in top form either, failing to either come off as the serious elder statesman he is or the raging liberal stump-orator he can be.  The night was stolen, by Barack Obama.  He is a strong speaker, damn good looking, and running for an open seat in the Senate with no competition.  He's also a minority voice that doesn't speak   only  to minorities.  I was a big fan of Carol Moseley-Braun, who also had that quality of turning her racial experience into an American experience without sacrificing her identity, and was enraged that Al Sharpton, who panders to only the worst instincts in whites and blacks alike, did so much better in the Presidential primaries than she did [she was my number three pick, believe it or not.]  Illinois has done it again, and this time I hope the Senator won't make the mistake of dining with African dictators and ruining his career in its infancy, like CMB did.  This night should have been more inspiring, but it comes at an awkward moment.  Tomorrow we get Edwards, Thursday we get Kerry, yesterday we had the Clintons, so tonight had to be star-studded to keep up, and only Obama really managed to make it work for him.   urlLink  Tim Noah on working the DNC :  Being a reporter at a political convention is a lot like having sex. Hey there, gorgeous, would you like to interview me? The American people this, the American people that. Oh … cliché. Cliché, cliché, witticism, cliché, insight borrowed from the  New York Times . Fact retrieved from an appropriately obscure …   please  keep ask-ask-ask-ask-ask-asking … Oh  yeah  … cliché—don't stop asking!—evasion of difficult …  Yeeeeeesssss!    He also covers the   Herald's  "discovery" (i.e. republication of a thirty-year-old article) that Teresa once called Teddy K a "perfect bastard."  Of course, she didn't quite say that anyway, she said he   would be  a perfect bastard if he stayed married to keep the Catholic vote -- he would soon thereafter divorce.  Former Boston mayor Ray Flynn also makes an appearance as a pro-life Democrat.  As all those who follow Bay State politics know, this isn't suprising.  What is a little surprising is that Ray Flynn, the notorious alcoholic who often had to have security let him into his Embassy residence in Vatican City because he was too drunk to work the codes, isn't dead of liver damage yet.  Where is the BU Chancellor and Progressive Fascist Democrat John Silber hiding himself?  I want to shake his tiny, tiny hand.

       urlLink  Someone at Slate reviews a bad book.   He also attacks the sometimes gross and creepy relationships between publishing and movie studios.   The significance of Wagner's scribbling is that it is exactly what you end up with if publishing and fiction writing become a pursuit of cheap hipness and movie rights. The blatant soliciting for a movie option altogether mocks the obsolescent category of literate readers A Movie ... and a Book  is an awful movie treatment undercover as a godawful novel. If Wagner's début represents a new cynicism in the industry currently enmeshed in a publishing frenzy, the day when editors will hire some good-looking people to pretend to be writersthe literary equivalent of 'N Synccould be only weeks away. And I cannot escape a vision of a dark room somewhere in Albania, full of wretched ex-professors of English filling up pages according to outlines sent from the New York headquarters, then mailing the slim manuscripts directly to Hollywood.  Perhaps it should be encouraging to young writers to know they are running out of cool authors in New York, so they have to import them from Switzerland. Or to witness that the democratic ideal inherent in literatureeverybody has something to sayhas reached its limit in Wagner's case: It is no longer necessary to be able to write in order to be a writer. You just have to appear cool, and some publisher, forgetting what brought him to books in the first place, will pick up the meanderings you jotted down stoned out of your head. Alas, there are readers, the people who might buy the book, believing for a careless moment the publisher's praise and lies. There are those silly people who read, who choose one of those 10,000 novels and spend some time trying, for no particular reason, to listen to and understand a perfect stranger. To those people Daniel Wagner and his publisher owe at least an attempt at writing.  People whine a lot about how many movies are based on novels, but hardly anyone complains that nearly all novels are written to solicit a movie option.  Think about how much better the novels of three major pop novelists are when you don't have to   read  them.  King, Clancy and Grisham.  Even more "serious" writers, who pursue an art that seems very un-movielike (Bret Easton Ellis comes to mind) end up on the screen, and afterward you realize that   American Psycho  was a movie all along, just waiting for Mary Herron to save it from Ellis.  I don't necessarily have a problem with this, though I wish filmmakers would be brave enough to film truly literary novels in a way that complements then instead of reducing them.  Still, from quotes in the review, it seems that Mr. Wagner might be the new  urlLink Daniel Quinn , whose hideous telepathic gorilla is so often confused for a serious philosopher that it makes me want to eat a champagne flute.  If novels   have  to be about ideas, they should at least not be extended lectures on "takers and givers" or pose such idiotic formulations as "observe your life from the third person, and if it's funny or strange, it's a movie; a book  is when something dramatic is happening to you."  All we get from that is that all movies are funny or strange and all novels are "dramatic."  Go home, Swissy.  And take Ishmael with you.

       1. Let's Do The Time Warp Again:  I know I talked about this in a previous post, and I also know that Pierluigi got a more in-depth e-mail on the subject, but I am so obsessed I can't stop.  On Saturday I bought the Decemberists' first album,   Castaways and Cutouts , and was really diggin on this music and felt dumb for not picking them up sooner, since Pier had been so insistent I do so, and they are a local band.  But then, perusing the liner notes I was dumbfounded to see his name.  Colin Meloy.  Could it be the same?  I couldn't remember how he spelled his name.  It could have been Collin Malloy, or something.  I raced online to find out.  Their website's biographical information was no help.  But within moments I'd confirmed it.  This was the very same man with whom I shared a cold December stage with in a 1992 production of   Its A Wonderful Life  in Helena.  Odd enough, right?  But it's so much worse.  I was in love with Colin Meloy. Desperately, savagely, pubescently in love with everything he said and did.  I thought he had a terrible voice, but couldn't get enough of his renditions of "Brown-Eyed Girl" and "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."  I longed for the nightly choking he gave me when Uncle Billy loses the money.  His performance as Scrooge in the previous year's   A Christmas Carol  had earned him my devotion, but actually   working with him?   Over the years my ardor has waned, but so powerful are my memories of him [he was my first full-blown man-crush after all, perhaps even   the  reason I'm gay] that I can't hear any of the various 60s and 70s tunes he'd sing with his band Happy Cactus without remembering him fondly.  And now, here he is.  Look at him!  He's still a nerdy gorgeous wonder, and he's making complex, rich and gorgeous music.  And he lives in Portland.  I feel totally creepy about the whole thing.  My long simmering crush is a full blown forest fire again.  And now the difference in our ages isn't creepy at all.  Plus he talks about gay marriage a lot and is doing a benefit concert for SMYRC (the Sexual Minority Youth Resource Center here in Portland) which obviously means he wants to be filled up with my babies, "girlfriend" or not.  urlLink    photo comes from  urlLink  here    2. The Democratic National Convention:  Almost as hot as Colin Meloy.  Crazy hats, Clintons, and the incipient defeat of President Bush.  And tonight is a wet-dream of mine come true: Teresa, Teddy and Barack.  All in one night?  Can I contain myself?  Hot hot HOT!!  I am SO getting knocked up tonight.   3. Songs I love by bands I hate:  This has been a rather small subcategory of music for me ever since I started listening more regularly to radio [my car has no tape deck, much less a CD player].  There are bands I know I hate and yet sometimes I hear a song, am wowed, and look it up only to be horrified.  It took me a while to work up the courage, but now I have accepted this in the same way that I have accepted Renee Zellwegger as a great actress.  I want to hate her, but cannot.  This subcategory really came into being with Matchbox-20's "Disease," which I found sexy and exciting and rockin.  I hate that it is sung by that faggy-hairdo'd fag, but what can I do?  Now, it isn't making the list because of "Disease" because that would be dumb.  That song is   so  eight months ago.  The new song I love by a band I hate is Linkin Park's "Breaking The Habit."  I take the risk of sounding like a really ugly fifteen-year-old girl right now, but I can really relate to this song and it makes me happy in perversely sad way to listen to it.  The fact that I hate Linkin Park more than I hate Tarantino and Fincher combined only, somehow, makes it better.   4.  urlLink    Showgirls: VIP  :  The greatest movie in the history of movies is going to be even greater than ever now!  "Pin The pasties On the Showgirl" game?    Showgirls  shot glasses and drinking games?!  It makes me so horny I am willing to use multiple puncutation.  The commentary track is done by a man who I saw do the commentary live in what was at once the greatest and most disappointing experience of my life (great and disappointing because technical difficulties caused the man to storm out in the middle of the movie.)  The only thing that might make this better in inclusion of the rarely seen TV-cut of the film, in which bras have been painted over all the titties.  I can't wait until I possess you,   Showgirls: VIP .  "It must be weird not havin' guys cum on you, anymore."  Well don't worry, Elizabeth Berkley, I'll be cummin on you again in no time, with or without your period!    5. Smoking cigars found on slides in playgrounds:  Did I really do it?  Yes.  Would I do it again?  Absolutely.

      The  urlLink  Faux Faulkner contest  is over and the winner is an inspired Three Stooges bit.  Full text at the link, but here is my favorite part:  Then Moe, aiming his extended fore and middle fingers, thrusting them into Curly’s eye sockets, heedless of the pain or even the surcease of sight this might inflict.   LARRY: Hey! He didn’t do nothin’!   MOE: Oh, yeah? Sez who? (This is not for you to judge or even acknowledge, this grievance between Curly and me, but is an old blood enmity which only we Howards can comprehend, while you, being a Fine, cant begin to plumb the depths of it. That is it. We are Howards and you are only a Fine, and being a Fine, you are not fit to regard us with anything more than sullen trepidation.) Now get going, lame brain. We got work to do.   CURLY: La dee, la dah ... At last it is Curly who picks up the plank, rough hewn and smelling of sweet gum, and—feeling the weight and heft and fiber of it—swings it innocently (bending to retrieve the tool, the ball-peen hammer dropped casually on Larry’s toe) and feeling the awful force of the blow as it (the plank) catches Moe upside his head and hearing the dreadful thunk of wood against bone and sinew, a sound the like of which he has not heard since his uncle (Irving) took them (Curly and Moe) to the park where he (the uncle, Irving) slapped with the blade of an oar the rotting rind of an overripe muskmelon.

      Clinton rocks out hard core.  His speech kicked serious mega ass.  One of the most thrilling parts about the speech is his willingness to attack himself to build Kerry up.  The Republican tax cuts are, every time he mentions them, "my tax cut."  This is the best bit on that theme: "[I]f you believe it is good policy to pay for my tax cuts with the Social Security checks of working men and women and borrowed money from China and Japan, you should vote for them. If not, John Kerry's your man."  He acknowledges his privilege and then asks to have the privilege removed.  Bravo, Mr. C.  [Kerry, by the way, uses this same technique on Health Care, talking about how he is wealthy enough to afford any health care he needs, and has access to the congressional health plan to boot.]  But, even more shocking, and more perversely, passionately brilliant, is this passage which made my heart get all warm and woozy:  During the Vietnam War, many young men, including the current president, the vice president and me, could have gone to Vietnam and didn't. John Kerry came from a privileged background. He could have avoided going too, but instead, he said: Send me.  When they sent those swift boats up the river in Vietnam, and they told them their job was to draw hostile fire, to wave the American flag and bait the enemy to come out and fight, John Kerry said: Send me.  The "send me" refrain carries on for a while, and is genuinely great oration, but it's that first bit, where Clinton bravely steps up and takes it on the chin, including himself in the list of men who did not serve, that makes the biggest impression.  Kerry's courage and his sense of sacrifice are put into stark contrast to the varying ways that Clinton, Cheney and Bush used to avoid fighting in a war.  Clinton is also masterful at attacking Bush by praising Kerry.  Memorable is this very clever way of saying Bush is stupid and doesn't listen to anyone: "And in a time of change, he has two other very important qualities: an insatiable curiosity to understand the world around him, and a willingness to hear other views, even those who disagree with him."  Good stuff, Billy Boy.  Thanks for getting this show off to a great start.  For anyone who wants some actual insightful commentary on last night's doins, I suggest, as always,  urlLink  Sully.

      A while ago I mused on how Kerry needs to be seen with a gun as often as possible, and offered him extra points if he can shoot.  Look at  urlLink  this shootin, bitches :   Campaigning in Wisconsin over the Fourth of July holiday, John Kerry stopped by the Gunslick Trap Club in Holmen, snapped up a Beretta 12-gauge shotgun and coolly dispatched 17 of 25 clay pigeons. "I'm just doing what I normally do," Kerry told reporters.   17 of 25 is pretty damn good.  I wonder how that little prep-school pansy G.W. would stack up in a shoot-out?

      The Convention opens with Clintonpalooza.  Thousands of delegates stood ready to fellate the former President any time he wanted it.  Meanwhile, Jimmy Carter handed out little bags of peanuts and Hillary Clinton was brainwashing someone to kill Kerry on Thursday.  Clinton gave a stirring speech, exactly the kind of gather-the-troops message he was called on to deliver.  Senator Clinton's introduction was strong and gave absolutely no hint as to her own political future.   urlLink  CNN's "Pundits' Scorecard"  reveals many shocks.  Paul Begala thinks Clinton is perfect.  Bill Schneider loves the word "vision" almost as much as Stevie Wonder hates it.  But the best pundits involved are clearly Tucker Carlson and Mo Rocca.  Tucker, butt-plug fully inserted, declares that Clinton was "sharply partisan" and gives the X-Prez an F.  Oh, sorry I was partisan, Tucker, I guess I sort of thought this was my Party's mother-fucking NOMINATING CONVENTION or something.  I didn't realize it was the Republican Ladies' Knitting Circle.  But with your pretty face around, how could I have forgotten?  Partisanship aside, I'm not exactly sure how Tucker manages to translate "We have to choose between two strong men who love their country" as accusing "half the country of being evil."  But it is my boyfriend, Mo Rocca (whose million babies I'm still working on), who delivers the most resounding note on Day One: "I would have liked the speeches a whole lot more if there was a little more air conditioning."

      My boner for Heather Havrilesky is still tumescent, so here are some excerpts from  urlLink  "I Like To Watch."   This week she takes letters from fans, including this one from a man, who like me, realizes that Alan Ball's entire career is based on the promotion of homophobic stereotypes:  [T]he last half of the show felt like one of those anti-drug spots (usually aired between two beer commercials featuring Hawaiian Tropic bikini models or twin blonde hotties) that want to convince us that pot makes 13-year-old girls pregnant . . . I understand your argument, but I'm just surprised to see "Six Feet Under" resemble a puritanical morality play in which the gross gay boy gets what Pat Robertson thinks he deserves. Except for the blow job, of course.  Heather responds:  First of all, pot does make 13-year-old girls pregnant. I should know. I have, like, a million of my own babies already, thanks to my inability to remove my face from the bong during those formative preteen years. It was worth it, though, dude. Mommy got me this rad 6-foot bong for my 12th birthday that you could only use if you were sitting on my top bunk. Hot damn, those were good times. . . I still don't feel it's fair to accuse "Six Feet Under" of being moralistic. When I think of all the times that characters on SFU 1) took drugs without killing themselves or someone else, 2) got drunk and drove without crashing, 3) had cheap sex without getting pregnant or getting an STD or even seeing the person ever again, 4) talked shit about each other without being found out, 5) got upset and ignored the baby without the baby falling off the bed onto its head, etc., I really have to say that, if anything, David's suddenly having to pay for his carelessness  Then a reader asks about Nate's baby, which never moves:   I noticed that, too. Maya's head didn't move once during that conversation in the kitchen where Nate was lamenting the state of the universe. Maybe she's really into Daddy's existential angst right now and will use it one day to formulate a groundbreaking dialectic inquiry into the nature of human suffering.  On   Joe Schmoe Two :  When Tim says something like, "Man, Bryce is a total psycho!" don't you feel a little like busting in his kneecaps with a baseball bat? And I can't help but be hard on Amanda. She's so sorority-girl catty and judgmental, yet so totally dull. If you're gonna jump to premature conclusions and formulate unfair assumptions about people, at least make sure they're insightful or colorfully mean.

      In honor of  urlLink  Ben's post on   Donnie Darko: Director's Cut  , I'm carrying a link to the  urlLink    Donnie Darko  "Cliffs Notes" at Salon.   Why are people so obsessed with their little "theories?"  I really want to know.  I love movies that are confusing, where the pieces don't quite fit, but not because I like puzzles, or want to spend hours of my life sorting it out.  Even if that's what the filmmaker intends, it's retarded stupid.  What strikes me as powerful and moving in films like   Donnie Darko, Mulholland Drive  and   Memento  is not that I can't figure out what's happening but that   what's happening doesn't matter.   The movies are more aesthetic than narrative or psychological.  Deconstructing it all robs it of some of that force.    Donnie Darko , in particular, strikes me this way.  If it can all be chalked up to Weird Science, or God, or Crazy Teenager then why do we watch it?  It's not good science, it's not particularly interesting theology, it's terrible psychology.  Trying to figure out what's going on in Donnie's head is pointless, because he is essentially impenetrable.  That's what is so compelling in his character and in Gyllenhaal's performance.  There is a searing pain that is unexplained and unexplainable.  Trying to explain the world as a Tangent Universe makes a neat kind of sense, and may even be the canonical explanation, but you don't need that explanation for the movie to work.  It doesn't have to make sense and it should not make sense.  Among the many things that makes   Fight Club  such an abominal and horrific failure is that the "explanation" is too neatly revealed in the narrative.  The film becomes too smart, and too penetrable, for its own good.  The same can be said for   The Sixth Sense  as well.  Remember when Susan Sontag cried out against "interpretation" of literature and found cinema refreshingly immune to interpretation?  Well, forty years later, profound uninterpretable films are being drowned in the same sea of viewer masturbation and the all-devouring   need to know  that has done so much to ruin the novel.  So, the link is there, take it if you wish.  But I encourage you not to succumb.  Just let   Donnie Darko  work its haunting, mysterious, beautiful magic and shut your f'ing mouth.

      Sometimes I think that in a secret, transgendered universe (Trannyverse), I am Heather Havrilesky (she of "I Like To Watch".)  One clue to this wormhole connection of ambiguous genitalia is that she and I are both far too fond of the phrase "I want to have a million of his/her babies."  I want to have a million of Rivers Cuomo's babies, and another million of Stephen Malkmus's.  Heather wants to have a million of   Six Feet Under 's babies.  Now take this passage from  urlLink  an interview with Zack Braff  regarding his new movie   Garden State :   Did you cast Natalie Portman because, like everyone else in the known universe, you're in love with her and want to have a million of her babies, or did you cast her because she auditioned?    No, Natalie Portman doesn't audition for movies anymore. I just think she's a magnificent actress and has something really unique. I don't think there's anybody quite like her. And I feel like, as a kid, in "The Professional" and "Beautiful Girls," she showed something that was so extraordinary, and I haven't really had a chance to see her do that as a young woman, and I was dying to see her [do that] because I knew she could. So she was the first choice.    Did you enjoy working with her?   She's great. She's just an amazing person. She's so humble and real and sweet and funny. I had a great time working with her.    So you do love her.    I do love her. I do want to have a trillion of her babies.  Frankly, I don't think it very fair that Mr. Hit-Sit-Com ups the ante.  A   trillion?   I don't have a big enough womb for that.  How can I compete?  I don't want Natalie Portman's babies, anyway.  But, when Rivers is swimming in a sea of a million babies and he looks over our barbed wire fence into Zack and Natalie's back yard to see a whole trillion babies it is sure to cause a fight. "You don't love me as much as Zack loves Natalie." "That's not true, Rivers.  I know I haven't given you that many babies, but we named each and every one after a song you wrote.  Zack just named all of his 'Queen Amidala.'  Even the boys." "Babies equal love, Josh.  Also, if you really loved me you'd be skinny.  Zack is skinny.  Don't I deserve skinny?"  Thanks for ruining my life Zack Braff. Fuck you and your little "movie."

      A while ago  urlLink  Ben  provided a link to Quinn Skylark's BookWatch.  I love this book blog.   urlLink  Here is the scoop on Michael Chabon's new project  (from   EW ):  Chabon describes the book on which he's working, a "mystery-thriller with a twist" called The Yiddish Policemen's Union. "It's set in an alternate universe," Chabon tells the magazine, "where instead of there being a Hebrew-speaking Jewish nationalist state in the Middle East, there's a Yiddish speaking Jewish state in Alaska."  Alaska seems a better place for the Zionist state.  I mean, who the hell wants Alaska anyway?  They don't call it Seward's Folly for nothing.  Nobody is going to blow themselves up in an Anchorage disco.  There are only, like, three Eskimos left anyway.  I love alternate history novels.  A lot.  It's a kind of crazy and highly nerdy fascination of mine.  I am enraged that Philip Roth stole my Lindbergh-as-fascist-president idea.  I used to voraciously read the works of the estimable Harry Turtledove, whose series on the Great War if the Confederacy had won the Civil War is pretty remarkable.  Also a delight is his series about an alien invasion during the Second World War, in which the aliens become addicted to ginger, which causes the females to enter their mating cycle, leading to lizard orgies of the very hottest sort.  But in addition to being imaginative, Chabon has a clear advantage over Turtledove.  Motherfucker can   write!   His short fiction is really amazing stuff, both lyrical and adventurous, maximalist in the most minimalist of ways.  And then there is   The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  which actually made me kind of want to read some comic books, and was a  totally engrossing narrative that left me feeling wrung-dry by the end, emotionally, physically, the whole works.  It was bold and brave and era-defining without being too clever and full of itself.  Chabon may well do for the Yiddish language what he's already done for comic books.  Now that I've had to abandon my Lindbergh plans, however, I've come up with a new idea (that someone is bound to steal.)  What might have happened had Seward   not  committed his Folly?  What if Alaska had remained a Russian holding up until, and after, 1917?  A Soviet Alaska would have dramatically increased the tension of the Cold War.  It's like the Cuban Missile Crisis times a million, dude.

      Loyal Fagistanis.  I need your help.  I was filling out [completely for fun.  that's right.] this personals ad form at  urlLink  The Mercury.   I never completed it, because I realized that they intended to print it in the paper, which seemed too grody even for me.  However, the form had a ridiculously long and complex list of fetishes.  Most were your run-of-the-mill dirty fag business.  Piss, enemas, chastity devices, cop uniforms, dildos, you know, the yoozh.  However, one of these fetishes was so bizarre, so totally alien, that I don't know what to say.  Applebee's.  Yes.  Like the restaurant, only a fetish.  What does this mean?  Is it some sexual practice I've never heard of?  I mean, I've seen a   lot  of fetish porn.  Or is it just a fetish for the generally cute boys who work at Applebee's?  For those silly green shirts?  What?  I am sexually confused.  I want to know, desperately, if Applebee's is a fetish of mine.  I keep trying to find it via Google.  "Applebee's sex" gives me links to erotica stories about a guy seducing a teenager and taking him to Applebee's for dinner before having sex with him.  "Applebee's fetish" is no more helpful.  If you, my proud and dear people, cannot help me find this answer I will have to write to Dan Savage.  I hold him responsible anyway, since   the Mercury  basically just reprints all the columns from Savage's estimable   Stranger .  Still, I would rather not be beholden to the likes of Dan Savage.  He'll almost certainly demand that I join him and Terry for some kind of threesome, and men named Terry are invariably serial killers.  So, please help my fetish-nerds!  I must know the answer to the Applebee's Fetish Riddle.

      Trust me, folks, Montanans are acutely aware of the often skewed views of us prevalent in popular culture. But, because we are a cheerful and forgiving lot, we are often more amused than offended by mischaracterizations. After all, what does one expect people from, say, New York City, will think of a large, rural, relatively unpopulated state whose biggest contributtions to recent history have been the Unabomber, the militia movement and that guy who killed those cops at the Capitol?   So it's not much of a surprise that music critics aren't quite sure how to deal with the Montana nativity of the Decemberists' front-man Colin Meloy. [Here I will pretend to be a journalist and give full disclosure: I knew Colin twelve years ago when we worked together in a production of  It's A Wonderful Life  at Helena's Grandstreet Theater. He played George and I played Uncle Billy. I was twelve and he was 17 or 18, so it's not like we were friends. He just choked me on stage a lot. I have very strong, visceral memories of him so it is sort of unsettling and shocking, in a very good way, to realize he is not only alive but making really pretty awesome records]   Here are some examples:   I want to know what the hell is going on in Montana. I mean besides peyote smoking and militia forming. Because it takes a certain kind of person to concoct an EP consisting of one 18-minute song based loosely on a Celtic myth that tells the tale of the Cattle Raid of Cooley in which a witch queen tries to wrestle the Great White Bull from its rightful owner.  That is from  urlLink Pitch.com.  Peyote smoking? I'm pretty sure this person just confused Montana with New Mexico. Since when is Montana known for its prevalence of peyote? Okay, I'll give them militia-forming (though I'll use a hyphen.) And if Montana loves two things it is cattle and Celts. But first of all, it's not as if Montana has produced a hundred and forty-four literary-influenced indie-rock artists. It has produced one. "What the hell is going on in Montana," indeed.   The folks over at  urlLink Pitchfork  do a little better, letting Colin talk about Montana himself. But apparently Pitchfork is so indie they've given up on little things like accuracy in spelling. "Boseman," people? With a mother f'ing  S?    Here's a non-Montana related quote about Colin from  urlLink Westword  that I really liked: "[H]e's just as inspired by writers Thomas Hardy, Dylan Thomas and Charles Dickens, who aren't exactly known for rocking out."   Anyone who thinks Tom Hardy doesn't rock out obviously hasn't seen  The Claim.  Oh wait. Nevermind. But come on.  Tess of the D'Urbervilles  is pretty rockin'.

Let my family set it with concrete. 3. Burn a barn. 4. Punch a horse in the skull. 5. Trick a girl seeking an abortion into preforming sexual favors on me   Things other Faulkner books make me want to do:  1. Rape someone with a corn cob 2. Get castrated 3. Go to Memphis for some whores 4. Hunt bears 5. Kill someone

      I hate to spoil y'alls fun, cuz I know morality isn't sexy.  But I have to point out that while Tim and Ben are getting ragin' boners from 14 year old girls,   Degrassi: The Next Generation  is  urlLink  converting impressionable young people to the sin of homosexuality:   Melissa Fryrear, gender issues analyst at Focus on the Family, said the show's young audience is especially vulnerable to such confusing messages.  "It's not uncommon for young people in that age group — around 12, 13, 14 — to be questioning, to some degree, their sexuality," she explained. "On average, it was 25 percent."  If kids take in the pro-gay messages without parents providing context, she said the result could be disastrous.  "If you have a show like this, that is portraying homosexuality so positively," she said, "it may influence them where they might assume that they're gay, when in reality that is not an issue for them."

      Salon has an interview with Pierluigi's buttboy  urlLink  Alan Moore .  I can't quite bring myself to finish it.  As most of you know, I don't read comics.  It's not that I disdain them in a Harold Bloom kind of way, it's just that I have no taste for the form.  It's like children's books.  Many children's books are works of genius, and I have great respect for the good writers in the genre, but I just don't have the time or the desire to bother.  This article doesn't help.  First of all, the interviewer loves having Alan's cock in his mouth.  There are constant comparisons to "certified" literary geniuses (Pynchon and Burroughs, geniuses neither, among them) and announcement that Moore's work predicts the future in startling ways.  Oh, and he's the "one of the world's finest writers, period."  Don't forget that.  I've always preferred combative to cocksucking interviews, but that's just me.  The real problem here is Moore's discussion of fascism.  I wish people would shut the fuck up about fascism.  According to Moore everyone is a fascist.  Bush, Blair, Reagan, Bruce Springsteen, the cast of "Friends."  In fact, none of these people are fascists, and neither are the specific policies he decries.  The creepiest thing he mentions is Britain's use of public cameras to fight crime.  Orwell ruined public surveillance for all of us with   1984 , but the fact remains that public surveillance is not fascist and is, in fact, a good idea.  Your privacy ends at the doorstep, my friends.  Fascism is a specific combination of nationalism, expansionism, industrialism, a reliance on a mythic past and a fear of outsiders culminating in totalitarian political control.  Fascism has existed in Italy, Germany and Spain, and nowhere else.  Ever.  End of story.  But whenever we think someone is reaching too far, that their government is too powerful, they are suddenly fascists.  But it's all so tricky.  Moore says Reagan is a fascist because he didn't respond to the AIDS crisis.  So, let's play the game What Would Hitler Do?  Would he simply not respond?  Or would he round up the AIDSies and put them to death?  You can't call a government totalitarian because it   doesn't  exercise its power.  That's just dumb.  But it's not even that Moore doesn't know how to use a dictionary.  It's far more insidious.  He derides Reagan in part because he was an actor, and calls forth a vision of Robert Downey, Jr. as Governor of California.  It ends with this chilling call for "electoral reform":  "Unless we get our democratic system overhauled fairly urgently, there is really no telling what manner of monsters or buffoons we'll have steering us into this still-young century."  I have no idea what he means by this, but in the flow of his argument he seems to be calling for a ban on actors becoming presidents.  Or perhaps more drastic electoral reforms, such as banning the "god-struck rednecks" from voting, or maybe banning voting altogether.  Reagan, after all, won a decisive victory in 1984 by both the Electoral College standard and the popular vote standard.  What kind of "reforms" would prevent a popular and populist president from beating unpopular, elitist candidates?  So, maybe there's a little bit of fascism in Moore too?  The interviewer and Mr. Moore both criticize the media for a short-circuit in reality in which we see the events of 9/11 and think it is "like a movie."  And yet both compare the same event, without thinking this is bad, to the events in one of Moore's comics.  This just puts them both in the Literature=Good/Mass media=Bad camp that is both hallucinatory and impotent.  And I don't think this tendency to compare real human events to the products of humans is new or disturbing.  In the days of the Enlightenment, the body and mind were viewed as an intricate clockwork.  Then our bodies became "factories" with the Industrial Revolution.  Now our brains are "computers."  There is a definite trend to compare our incredibly complex and unexplainable realities to simpliistic and explainable technologies.  Whether that's a computer, a comic or a movie: same diff, dudes.  But don't worry.  Alan has some great words of wisdom.  When asked about the shocking nature of beheadings he replies: "Well, yeah, heads -- they're important."

      Today word with no meaning is: humane.  The  urlLink  International Whaling Commission  is meeting this week to discuss various whale related issues.  One resolution declares that the use of grenade-tipped harpoons causes the animals to "suffer" and therefore is "inhumane" and new methods of killing should be devised.  The pro-whaling group High North Alliance fires back with: "Whale hunting is very humane."  Several pro-whaling nations have been struggling for years to lift the whale hunt moratorium.  Their argument is that whales can be hunted in the same way as any other population of animals, as long as the catch-limit is sustainable.  Protecting all species of whales universally is foolish because not all are endangered.  Furthermore, an international regulatory body is bound to fail in its mission.  It can neither protect the animals from illicit slaughter nor regulate sustainable hunting.  The issue, to me, is whether or not individual nations should be allowed to regulate the hunting of species of animals in their waters without the interference of uninterested parties from nations that oppose whaling.  And it all comes down to this word.  Humane.  At some point we began to apply this word willy-nilly to other life forms.  Frankly, whether or not a whale, a cow, a deer, a grouse or a trout "suffers" while being killed is of no importance.  Why is it incumbent upon humans to treat other species humanely?  Does a whale not suffer when attacked by a school of sharks?  Does a trout not suffer when an eagle pierces its body with talons?  Getting killed by some other creature sucks, people.  That's just how it is!  I personally question the use of "humane" when applied even to other humans, since I have seen little evidence that the instinctual reaction of one human to another is sympathy and compassion.  The "humane" thing to do to a deformed child might well be to smash its skull with a rock.  But certainly it shouldn't be so difficult to realize that applying the concept of "humanity" to non-humans is fucked up tarded.  When a whale starts quoting Shakespeare and driving a car, then we can discuss their humanity.  Until then, let's get our harpoon on!

      Pierluigi explains his "CIA director" comments below in the comments to my comments on his comments to Tim's comments on Pier's original "Five People I'd Like To Meet In Heaven on Tuesdays."  That's a lot of comments.  Here's another comment: yes Sandy-Sam might well have ended up Director of the CIA, but he was also seen as a front-runner to head the State Department.  How appalled Thomas Jefferson would be to know that the office he held before anyone else is now given to gnomes like Sandy, foreign gremlin-gnomes like Albright and Kissinger, and to men named Colin (who also happen to be Negroes.)  Where's Warren Christopher when you need him?  And, if Sandy did indeed sneak sensitive documents out of the National Archives in his socks isn't that a major reason to make him the spy-master?  Also, he only snuck out "copies" of the documents.  I guess he wanted to sell his personal notes on security for New Year's Day 2001 with Al Qaeda so they can wreak havoc when they complete their time machine in the mountains of Afghanistan.  While I'm on the subject of Sandy Bergergate, let me continue.  First of all, I think his smuggling of documents is a complete non-issue.  Republican cries of "Natonal Security Crisis" are more pathetic than my attempts at seducing straight men.  Also, what is up with the 9/11 commission calling for a "cabinet-level intelligence office?"  I am really get sick of people thinking that creating whole new Cabinet offices will somehow fix a problem.  This goes double-time for the Department of Homeland Security.  Not only did that let Eddie Munster append the title of Secretary to his name, but it's a joke of an office.  The fact is kids, we already have a secretary of "homeland security" and a "national cabinet-level intelligence chief" and she's called the National Security Adviser.  Doesn't it seem obvious to give Condi Rice some real power already?  And for anyone who says that she is already too busy handling her duties, the aforementioned foreign gremlin-gnome Henry Kissinger held the post of NSA and was Secretary of State   simultaneously .  That didn't slow his war criminal career down one bit, now did it?  I know I have a crush on Condoleezztello, but she's eighteen times the man Kissinger was.  If Bush won't dump Cheney for her, the least he can do is give her more power.  And a sensual massage.

      I have finally finished reading Dale Peck's novel,   The Law of Enclosures .  I posted a bit of the prose many weeks ago in "The Wrathful and The Gloomy" but now it's review time.  The novel is good, if inconsistent, and filled with a kind of audacious power that is riveting.  Peck understands anger in a way that few writers do, and the way that anger and love can become linked and inseparable.  There are parts of the novel that make me really wonder what kind of aesthetic project Peck has in mind.  His criticism is notoriously absent of anything but crushing negativity, and I'm not sure where the line is between certain excessive parts of this novel and David Foster Wallace.  The structure of the novel is decidedly modern, moving back in forth in time, using a tricksome pattern of changing names (Beatrice to Bea, Henry to Hank and back again), and an unorthodox structure to carry his powerful message.  The middle of the book is a memoir of Peck's father and his wives, and is easily the most moving piece of the work.  But Peck is clearly playing with the novel form in a way that while serious, and I think artistically merited and brilliant, isn't that much different from footnotes really.  The big difference between Peck and the Lit Boys is that his novel is uncompromisingly   serious.   There is humor, but the jokes are just that, they aren't constructions meant to be absurd.  There is one extremely postmodern construction, a house gone awry, that almost pushes its way into the realm of useless, Eggersian tripe. And that is a major achievement; Peck is walking on the line here, and manages to stay upright.  The final ten pages of the novel could easily have been lifted from Joyce or Faulkner; there was even what seemed a clear reference to the Molly Bloom portion of   Ulysses  despite Peck's dislike for Joyce.  Still, all the talk of Peck's inconsistent vision of literature aside, the novel is remarkable.  As I said, it has its faults, including the most Wallace-like moment when the two main characters, Bea and Hank, first get jobs.  Bea works at a grocery store with a gaggle of girls named for flowers (Hyacinth, Orchid, Rose, Lily . . .) and Hank works for a plumber and everyone in the company is named for beer (Bud, the Millers, father and son and the secretary Ann Heiser . . . )  Giving characters tricky names is usually a bad plan, Stan.  Very few writers are Charles Dickens after all.  Peck certainly is not.  This kind of bald, ill-placed humor just serves to take away from the flow of the story and make us roll our eyes.  The faults are few and far between, though.  The story itself is beautiful in its simplicity.  Boy thinks he's dying, meets girl, doesn't die, marries girl, grows to hate girl (mutually, of course), grows old, falls in love again.  There is something impenetrable, ineffable and unexplainable at the heart of the story.  Love and hate become mysterious forces, nearly identical, that push these two people to the brink and somehow pull them back again.  There is no overriding message here.  There is only the story of one love affair, unique and generic, and characters you can't help but love.  The memoir portion is particularly forceful in its imagery and its emotional range.  Dale Peck learns early on that love and violence are easily entwined, and that his love for his father is unexplainable, even though it is as strong as his justifiable hatred.  His yearning for his mother, and his interactions with the parade of stepmothers, is heartwrenching and devastatingly honest.  His prose is the real clincher here.  It can veer into the too-trite, too-ordinary, then flash back into incandescent fury, piercing and lyrical, full of rage and sympathy, indifference and longing.    The Law of Enclosures  rises above its multiple faults and becomes an elegant and entrancing meditation on love, loss and healing.  Dale Peck has every right to be angry that his work is overlooked while the world sucks Rick's little Moody.

      In my "The Wrathful and The Gloomy" column below I quoted a woman on the 94.7 Comment Line who referred to the music they play as "feminine."  Sadly, the full quote I attributed to her was incorrect and the real version is eighty-million times more hilarious: "What's up with all this gay   Dawson's Creek  bullshit?  Give me a break, you're not alternative, you're *bleeping* feminine!"

      Long ago, in the early days of Fagistani independence, I published a post on Kenzaburo Oe's novel   Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids .  It was intended as the first part of on ongoing series of reviews of novels/stories/plays/poems by Nobel laureates, since I'm on a crusade to read them all anyway.  Right after reading Oe I read  urlLink   Barabbas   by Par Lagerkvist, but then forgot to write about him.  The reasons for this are many, of course, including sheer laziness and general drunkenness.  But there were also good reasons.  Lagerkvist's novel is slim, spare and painful.  It took me a single afternoon to read and yet it stayed in my mind, rolling around, for a couple of weeks.  The spiritual and philosophical weight of the story of the man whose life was exchanged for Christ's might be difficult to integrate in any circumstance, but seems particularly difficult for someone without faith.  And yet, Lagerkvist's work seems especially focused on the faithless.  Barabbas himself is a man who wants to believe but never can.  His overwhelming desire to be good is always clouded by the weight of evil that has settled over his life.  He encounters people of true faith, and they are universally pathetic (a girl with a harelip, a skeletal slave, a lifeless man raised from the grave) and yet in their pathos is the resonating power of God and Barabbas, a physically imposing man, finds himself destroyed by their moral strength.  The novel exhibits all the elements of Nietzsche's "slave morality," of course -- the insistence that those who are the most pathetic are the closest to God chief among them -- but it is moving and wondrous and quiet.  Even the action is muted, suffocated under the passionate power of a God trying to speak to a deaf man.  I read the novel a few weeks after I saw   The Passion of the Christ , so comparison seems impossible to avoid, even now, so long after I've forgotten Gibson's little movie altogether.  I did not hate the film, but nor was I moved by it.  Reading   Barabbas , which takes scarsely more time than slogging through Gibson's torturefest, will teach you far more about Christ's message and about the meaning of Christ's sacrifice than   The Passion  ever could.  Christ hardly makes an appearance, the metaphysical aspects are handled with startling intelligence, the grueling torture is nowhere present, the Jews are not condemned, in fact, most of them don't even know who Christ is or that he is being executed, but the core of feverishly intense spiritual mortification is everywhere.  Barabbas is pushed as far as he can be pushed, wrestling with the angels of sin, guilt and doubt and never winning.  Lagerkvist's work is not exactly a novel, but instead in that vein of parable of which the Bible itself is the exemplary text.  Rich with meaning, teaching a lesson clearly but not explicitly.  The Nobel Prize Committee  urlLink  bestowed him with the Prize  "for the artistic vigour and true independence of mind with which he endeavours in his poetry to find answers to the eternal questions confronting mankind."  Indeed, Lagerkvist's work is a vigorous endeaver, though it doesn't answer the questions of faith that even the faithless must face. Instead his violently subdued novel gives us weapons, so that we too can wrestle with the angels and perhaps we, unlike Barabbas, can find some peace at the end.

I might have a chance of becoming the next Dan Savage, but only if I find an alt weekly newspaper to edit and start writing a sex column.  The fact that I have no sexual experience that isn't creepy might hinder my chances on the second one.  Besides, I'd much rather be Wonkette.

Of course, it'd be more accurate to say, "Vote or I'll wave a gun in your face in a midtown nightclub," but that doesn't fit so well on a t-shirt. And it's not true, of course.

       urlLink  Pierluigi on Sandy Berger :  Sandy Berger...well I don't quite have the wit to make a fun joke about him, but who the fuck names their kid Sandy besides the fucking Alomars?  Who would ever have wanted a head of the CIA named Sandy?  This was the funniest shit anyone has ever said about the rather boring Mr. Berger.  I actually laughed out loud. But, to put your mind at rest, P, his actual name is Samuel (I don't know how Sandy came out of that, Sam Berger sounds fine to me) and he was   not  the Director of the CIA.  He was the National Security Adviser.  And if a ninja turtle named Condoleezza can have the job, why not a fat little gnome named Sandy?

      Ben posts a nice  urlLink  pro-country music  quote in 2+2=5.  Then Pier gets his hipster panties in a bunch, of course.  I have long felt like the lone lover of indie rock who also is a supporter of country music.  It's nice to know that not everyone is an idiot.  It reminds me of an article in Salon about personals ads, and the author wrote about how when she reads through personals she is always on the look out for people who list "country" as a musical style they enjoy, especially if its alongside alt rock and heavy metal, because it shows that the person in question is open-minded at the very least.  I agree.  Even though much of very-contemporary country music is pretty shitty, please remember that 90% of indie rock is shitty too.  Almost no music has "enduring value" or whatever the fuck Professor Pier said.  And frankly, that's a good thing.  Also note that when people say "I hate country" they never distinguish between contemporary country and the older "country and western" style that I truly do love.  Johnny Cash is a country music singer.  He's also a fucking genius.  Same for Hank Williams, Marty Robbins, Loretta Lynn and on and on.  Even many contemporary country singers are awesome. Garth Brooks is now defunct, but he was a great songwriter.  Reba McIntyre has that hideous TV show, but she is an amazing singer.  But hipsters have a way of somehow incorporated Cash and Lynn into the pantheon of rock music without offending their own sensibilities.  I don't get it.  Now, Pierluigi wanted a defense of country music's worth so I'll give it.  Country music is populist music.  It speaks to poor and working class people in their own language and supports their cultural values (even if its a little picky about which values).  It's also "simplistic" as Herr Professor points out, but that's also what makes it so great.  Anyone with a guitar and a halfway decent voice can sing the catalogue of virtually any country music singer. Real people can sing these songs to other real people at picnics.  Can you say the same for The Walkmen?  Indie rock is beautiful and I can't wait to be filled up with its babies, but I think there is definitely value in being able to share a song outside the stereo.  And, if you need any further evidence that country music is well worth its existence, just remember that only the Irish sing about drinking more reverently than country singers.  And that, my friends, is a good thing.

      1.   Aaron Burr:   urlLink     In contemplating great presidents I started thinking, "Who is the greatest Vice President?"  Without a doubt, it's Aaron.  How many other VP's can boast that they nearly stole the presidential election from their own party's nominee, killed a former Cabinet member in a duel in Weehawken, NJ, and raised an army in an attempt to forge a personal empire in Mexico?  Plus, he might have had sex with his daughter.  Aaron, you make me all stinky down there.  2.   Comments on my favorite radio station (94.7 Alternative Portland) : The station has undergone major changes and emerged as a station that plays the best god damn music in the world: indie and alt rock galore!  I'm talkin' Cake, Bjork, the fuckin works.  But not everyone is amused.  One angry young man who apparently hates the 90s, spent hours thinking this one up before calling in: "This isn't 'alternative' Portland, it's early 90s Portland.  It sounds like a compilation CD stolen from a Jetta in Northwest Portland."  Schwarzenegger Prize goes to this young lady: "What the hell is up with all this whiny emo crap?  Your station's not   alternative  it's *bleeping*   feminine! "  3.   Voice Mail : Ben leaves me a rambling message on my phone and makes my day.  I like when people call me, even if I'm asleep when it happens.  Hearing robolady say "You have no new messages" makes my heart shrivel up.  So, thanks Benno!  4.   Interesting guest names at the hotel : This week we've got Mr. Nitzsche.  Last week we had Mr. Zuber.  The week before we had two guests in adjacent rooms named Mr. Coast and Ms. Beach.    5.

      Who would have guessed it?  The people of California toss out an experienced politician in favor of a professional body-builder and it turns out that he's a  urlLink  sexist homophobe.   Biggest political shocker since we learned Newt called Hillary a bitch.  For some reason, although these things normally make me very happy, this one just doesn't rise to the level of Richard Riordan's little doo-doo a couple of weeks ago, nor to the pure gleeful savagery of the Cheney-Leahy Debate.  It's just not sleazy and offensive enough to be funny, while still being sleazy and offensive enough to be sleazy and offensive.  And besides, Arnold, isn't it at least a   little  girlie to make your living by oiling up your body and acting like a female Soviet weightlifter turned stripper?  We all saw those photos of you from the 70s.  You were just one moustache shy of the Village People, dude.  Bruce Villanch was butcher than you.  You had to marry a horse-faced half-Kennedy who I'm pretty sure has undescended testes.  You probably unleashed all those ass-grabbing rumors just to cover up your molestation of Danny DeVito on the set of   Twins .  You're definitely the faggiest Republican since Dan Quayle, and that includes Orrin Hatch and Steve Forbes.  So don't think you can call   me  a girlie man and get away with it, Mr. Fake n' Bake.  I've got your fuckin' number.

      Speaking of LaRouche, here is the eminent Lyndon himself  urlLink  on Dick Cheney:   As coming developments will show more clearly, Mrs. Lynne Cheney's adopted rogue, her husband, the brutishly bungling Vice President Dick, is no self-made man, and certainly no genius. That snarling creature on that lady's leash, is a consummately greedy and culpable creature, but not a notably intelligent one. When one speaks of that Vice President, think of something more along the lines of Mrs. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's lurching Frankenstein Monster. In short: Dick Cheney did not create the beast he has become today. He is only a very bad actor, playing a part created by such cleverer men as Nazi "crown jurist" Carl Schmitt's one-time protégé, the Hutchins-appointed University of Chicago Professor Leo Strauss.  I've always pictured Dick as more the Freddy Krueger type myself, you know, child molesting, burned up.  Shambling Frankenstein's Monsters are too dignified for Cheney.  They can't swear for one thing.  Still, LaR clearly has a point.  I'm not sure what that point is.  The full text of the essay, if you're brave enough to slog your way through it, claims that FDR's legacy was destroyed by the "rock-sex-drugs-counterculture" of the 60s and that this movement gave birth to Beast-Man Cheney.  There isn't any logical flow to this argument, but I like it.  Hippies are gross.  I like to blame them for the state of the world.  Also, I like to imagine Cheney with long, greasy, stringy hair and a tie-dye T-shirt listening to Jimi Hendrix records and smokin' the mad mad spleefs.

      Poor Ralph Nader.  Such a tight spot he's found himself in up in  urlLink  Michigan.   How's a pretty girl to choose between two handsome Right Wing crazies?  Should Nader get on the ballot in the slot reserved for Pat Buchanan's Reform Party, or the slot that the Michigan Republican Party scored for him?  Being pure as the driven snow is so much easier when you're half-blind from crazy-eye, for sure, but can even Nader possibly think he's not a total fucking douchebag anymore?  John Kerry may be "beholden to special interests" but at least he is not beholden to Right Wing fanatics and cockmongers.

      I was going to create another list of ten presidents, based solely on their effectiveness as presidents.  I put the list together, and even began writing it, but then found that I was bored with myself.  For one thing, the overlap was too great to make it interesting (even with shifts in general position).  So, I'll just throw out the names and brief commentary on a couple of Presidents who didn't make the first list but would certainly make this list.  1. Bill Clinton: Clinton is the most gifted politician of his generation, and we may never live to see the likes of him again.  He did not move the country forward (which was a major criterion in the previous list), and his policy record is strong, but not immense (like LBJ's or FDR's), but his administration is still remarkable.  In fact, if you look at the bare facts, such as the devastating loss of both houses of congress for the first time in 40 years following the failure of his most important policy initiative, universal health care and then impeachment four years later, you'd think he was a miserable failure.  But what other man could have turned all that into six uninterrupted years of presidential supremacy virtually unseen since the days of FDR?  He was able to outmaneuver Gingrich and the Republicans at every turn, steal their policies, force them to shut down the government, and turn his impeachment into midterm   gains  for his party.  Not to shabby.  2. Theodore Roosevelt: Roosevelt is one of the greatest characters in American history.  His life story reads like the kind of epic novel that he adored.  As President, he emerged from the corpse of William McKinley as the youngest man ever to be President (including JFK, by the way).  He was distrusted by his own party and reviled by Democrats and yet managed to substantially reform the cabinet, enact conservation policies and the national park system, and expand his imperialist dream with the Panama Canal at a time when the United States was increasingly isolationist.  3. Ronald Reagan: Reagan's legacy is mostly vile.  Other than helping to speed the end of the Cold War (and his effect there was more limited than his hagiographers assume), there is no significant achievement of the administration that is not a horrifying catastrophe.  But, say what you will about the policies, Reagan knew how to communicate a vision to the public and use that leverage to get a mostly Democratic Congress to follow his lead on issue after issue.  And, like Clinton, even the worst scandals slipped right off of him (Iran Contra not the least.)  Reagan was not as freakishly gifted as Bill Clinton, but he was more forceful and more dedicated to something resembling a philosophy, so he deserves some kind of mention.

      As per Ben's request, I've put together a couple of lists of the best presidents of the nation.  Ben stipulated that these lists be Top Ten style, which makes it quite difficult.  George Bush is the 43rd POTUS, but only the 42nd person to have the title (for retarded reasons Grover Cleveland counts as two presidents.)  That means that roughly 1 in 4 will make it on the list.  Compare this to a top ten movies of the year list and you can see why this is difficult.  The bottom of these lists are presidents that might be no better than "near-great" in a normal standard, but I needed ten.  So, without further ado, here is the first list, of best Presidents in terms both of their powers/effectiveness but also in terms of how much I dig on their ideology and whether or not I think their net-result was overwhelmingly good or bad.  10. Martin Van Buren: The Little Magician was, of all Presidents, the most skilled party-builder and organizer (his only competition might be James Madison).  His towering achievement is the Democratic Party as we now know it, though Jackson tends to get the credit.  MVB lost a bid for re-election, and had a spotty record of legislation, but he was reasonably effective and a strong moral voice for the Party he would found and then abandon over the issue of slavery.  In the birth of popular politics, Van Buren was the keenest mind and makes the list out of sheer cleverness if nothing else.  9. Grove Cleveland: Another New York Democrat, Cleveland emerged as the man who saved the Democratic Party from total oblivion in the years following the end of Reconstruction.  Elected to two non-consecutive terms, he is the only member of his Party to serve between 1860 and 1912.  He used the strength of the Southern bloc and the huge upsurge in immigration to win the White House twice.  In addition, he managed to outmaneuver the Republican leadership in a way that prefigures Clinton in later years, blending a strong Reformist streak with pragmatic economics to radically alter the way the US government functions and to set the stage for much of the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century.  8. James K. Polk: Poor Mr. Polk.  One of a stream of forgotten men between Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln, Polk is virtually unknown.  Still, he ran the tightest ship of any president, set bold but limited goals and achieved them all.  He stated four goals for his Administration: the acquisition of California, the settlement of the Oregon Boundary Dispute, establishment of an independent Treasury, and a significant lowering of the tariff.  He accomplished all four (the first by the Mexican War.)  Without Polk's aggressive stances toward Britain and Mexico, it is very likely that much of the land the readers of this blog live in would not be part of the United States.  One can argue that imperialism and expansionism is always bad, but that's a false start on this question.  The question was not whether Europeans would settle the Western United States, it was which   nation  would do so.  I have no hesitation in saying it was better for everyone involved that it was the United States and not Mexico or Great Britain that ruled the Pacific coast.  7. Woodrow Wilson: Wilson makes it for a lot of obvious reasons.  The first Democrat to be elected to consecutive terms since Jackson himself, he led the nation through the Great War and the earliest phases of the Cold War, expanded on Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive agenda.  His noble aspirations for a League of Nations would drive him to his death, but he was an influential force in banishing American isolationism once and for all.  One of his greatest accomplishments was a mixed blessing: the Treaty of Versailles set the stage for WWII with every stipulation it contained.  And yet, its core values were incredibly progressive for their time, and the troubles nationalism proved to contain do not mitigate the fact that the idea of national self-determination was the first major attack on European imperialism and as such, Wilson is the godfather of the later independence movements worldwide.  6. Thomas Jefferson: Jefferson's presidency included a number of major accomplishments.  The Louisiana Purchase, the successful war against the Barbary Pirates, the roll back of some pieces of the Hamiltonian program and the retardation of full-blown industrial capitalism.  Jefferson was inconsistent, so that even his major achievements can't help him rise into the top five, but his work as a party leader, and his rhetoric of natural rights and individual liberty have provided the framework through which all American politicians shape their beliefs, however horrific those beliefs would be to Jefferson.  The mere fact that every political faction in America can invoke Jefferson on some level is a testimony to his enduring stature.  5. Lyndon Johnson: I can already hear the murmurs of dissent as I write this.  LBJ has a bad rep.  He's worse off that Polk, because at least Polk is safely forgotten.  LBJ's actions are criticized by every shade of the political spectrum, and often rightly so.  Vietnam was a moral catastrophe.  LBJ knew it but couldn't figure out how to fix it.  He was too tied to the outmoded Containment Theory, too cozy with the military industrial complex, and too weak (in a moral sense) to engage the issue forcefully.  But Vietnam should not overshadow the tremendous accomplishments of his Administration.  The list of accomplishments is stunning.  Medicare, Medicaid, VISTA, Job Corps, NEA, NEH, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 24th Amendment (which banned poll taxes), major advances in conservation, public schools and mass transportation, aid to small businesses, the Housing Act, immigration laws amended to end the practice of limiting immigration from certain nations, an executive order establishing affirmative action, PBS, significant increase in the minimum wage, the Highway Safety Transportation Act.  And he accomplished it all after a huge 11.5 billion dollar tax cut (admittedly at the expense of anything like a balanced budget.)  When Kennedy was killed in Dallas there were 35 million Americans living in poverty.  By the time LBJ's War of Poverty came to close in the madness of 1968 that number had plummeted to 12 million.  Vietnam and Civil Rights were the key defining elements of the 60s political world.  Vietnam is highly overrated in its importance.  The numbers killed were far smaller than the numbers whose lives were much better socially and economically in 1969 than in 1963.  4. Jackson: Andrew Jackson is the father of popular democracy in the United States.  He was an unwavering opponent of corporate greed and expansion, a ferocious advocate of the spoils system and easily the most powerful man to have held the office of the President up to that point.  His accomplishments are nearly all negative -- the Bank War is a grand example, but still admirable.   His history as an Indian killer and his attachment to slavery are troubling, but in a time when no President would have chosen not to kill Indians or keep slaves in chains, Jackson can be heralded as a strong voice for democracy and against big business.  3. George Washington: Washington was a great man, and by many reasonable standards should top this list.  He was a mediocre president -- the great accomplishments of his Administration were great for two reasons: 1. He was the first.  A whole government had to be created, and therefore anyone in this position would have had a tremendous impact.  2. Alexander Hamilton.  The man behind the President was easily the most powerful cabinet member in history, and perhaps the greatest man who has never been President.  Hamilton is best known for being shot to death by Vice President Burr in 1804 in New Jersey, but he was the intellectual force that drove the Washington Administration, despite Jefferson's attempts to destroy him.  Still, Washington rises high on this list despite his limited personal impact because Washington is the father of our nation.  Washington could have become a military dictator, he was offered a presidency for life by many of the great power-brokers in America, there were those who would have made him King.  He stopped them at every pass.  He resigned his military commission, which allowed for civilian control of the military.  He refused to run for a third term, essentially ending any debate of Presidencies-for-life.  These may seem minor things now, but Washington allowed democracy to flourish, resisting the temptation that a lesser man (to name Napoleon for only one) would have been incapable of ignoring.  2. Abraham Lincoln: The reasons here are too obvious to bother with.  The Civil War.  The preservation of the Union.  The abolition of slavery.  The creation of a truly powerful federal government.  A remarkable body of writings and political thinking, matched only by Jefferson.  1. Franklin Roosevelt: As with Lincoln, it's too obvious.  Roosevelt led the nation through two of its greatest crises, the Great Depression and the Second World War.  He fought valiantly behind the scenes to convince an isolationist nation to join the greatest moral war in history, and fought just as valiantly to ensure justice for working class people while preserving the free market and democratic capitalism.  Detractors say that the New Deal did not end the Depression, that it was WWII that did it.  They are right.  But what they forget is that the   reason  WWII did it and the New Deal did not was that Congress was unwilling to unleash the enormous amount of money it would have taken to end the Depression.  Once a massive war had been engaged, the money appeared and so it was still a basic matter of government spending that ended the Depression -- had Congress been willing to commit the resources to that crisis that it did to the next one, the Depression would have ended years earlier.  Roosevelt had his faults: the Court packing scheme, the internment of the Japanese, a certain tendency to throw his friends to the lions to protect his own fortunes, but there is simply no question about it.  FDR is the greatest man to have been president, as well as the greatest president.

      Dan Savage writes in Salon about  urlLink  nonmonogamy .  Savage admits that he and his partner have had threesomes, despite being fully committed to their relationship and to raising their child together.  He is willing to engage the most distressing element of the Gay Marriage Movement head-on, which is the Sullivan sponsored notion that gay people want exactly what straight people do, namely monogamy.  The reason this notion is ridiculous is twofold: for one thing, marriage is hardly needed in order for monogamy to exist, and for another it's clear that straight people don't want it any way.  And Savage is very good at building the argument that having the option of nonmonogamy could make marriages more manageable and reduce divorce rates.  The best bit is this:  This is the reason so many defenders of "traditional marriage" sputtered their way through appearances on "Nightline" and the Sunday morning news programs. Traditional marriage is just one option among many these days. A religious straight couple can have a big church wedding and kids and the wife can submit to the husband and they can stay married until death parts them -- provided that's what they both want. Or a couple of straight atheists can get married in a tank full of dolphins and never have kids and treat each other as equals and split up if they decide their marriage isn't working out -- again, if that's what they both want. (It should be pointed out, however, that a religious couple is likelier to divorce than atheists who marry in a tank full of dolphins.) The problem for opponents of gay marriage isn't that gay people are trying to redefine marriage but that straight people have redefined marriage to a point that it no longer makes any sense to exclude gay couples. Gay people can love, gay people can commit. Some of us even have children. So why can't we get married?  He's right of course.  "Traditional values" have already become so eroded that trying to enforce them is a little sticking a shredded, aborted fetus back into the womb.  But there is still a problem here.  This argument, that marriages can be defined in exactly the way those involved wish it to be, is a great one (Savage even endorses the option of "starter marriages" that are never designed to last "forever.")  Problem is: it's not a great argument   for  gay marriage.  It's an excellent argument   against  civil marriage altogether.  If we are going to reduce marriage to something that can't be defined except by a finite set of legal rights, then why not simply create a much more streamlined, less culturally-heavy system for endowing our partners/friends/lovers/buttboys with those rights?  Remove any obstacle to any person establishing those rights with anyone else.  From all indications, Savage supports nonomonogamy but not polygamy/polyandry, which just forces in one more outmoded "traditional value."  If marriage has already become as meaningless as Savage claims (and it has) then there is absolutely no reason for gays to fight to join the circus.  And there's no reason for all you straight Fagistanis to bother getting married either.  If you want monogamy, that's cool.  If you want orgies, just remember to invite me.  If you want to have a multiple marriage, that's also rad, even if the chances of your success are pretty slim.  It seems that gays like Andrew Sullivan want to be just like "straights" (that is, just like the imaginary straight ideal that has led to the whole problem in the first place) while gays like Savage want to be "married" but not have to conform to any kind of cultural values inherent in the concept.  Either marriage means something or it does not, and if it does not, then throw it away.  If it is merely the public commitment to a person, without any expectation as to what "commitment" means (I imagine the vows go like this: "I'm committed to you, but maybe not, for like, my whole life or anything.  I'm committed to you, but that's no reason to stop having sex with other people.") then why isn't a "commitment ceremony" enough?  And why do we have to be so public about it anyway?  I mean, won't people start to get that you are "committed" when you live together for years on end and start raising babies?  The public declaration seems somehow desperate, a childish squeal of "We are   so  committed!  Look how   committed  we are!"  Now, I'm all for Savage's program, of course.  I just don't see how or why marriage fits in.  Since every relationship can be (and should be) defined on its own terms, the state should have no power, and has no reason, to regulate that.  In fact, it becomes impossible to regulate that, as those rights and responsibilities inherent in "marriage" will eventually, and quite often, conflict with the individual definition thereof.  So please, dear fags and dear heteros, do not get married.  Just be way less annoying versions of Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, okay?  And have way more kinky sex on your live webcams for me to jack off to since I will never be committed to anyone at all.  I have to experience your commitment vicariously.  Thanks.

      I am thrilled beyond coherence that  urlLink "I Like To Watch"  is back. Heather Havrilesky is the most important woman in the world to me for the simple reason that because  she  watches TV and makes funny comments about it, I don't have to. I have only ever seen one episode of  The Sopranos , for instance. I have never seen  Six Feet Under  (at least in part because I would rather cut my own rectum out with an apple-corer than possibly to forced to admit that Alan Ball isn't a worthless sack of fag-skin.) I watch a moderate amount of network television, but a very moderate amount. So, with Heather, I can feel like I watch all these shows without doing the actual work. She has been missing for a few weeks, but now that the summer TV season is back in shape, so is she. Excerpts:   On The Emmys:   Fox's "Arrested Development" was nominated for comedy series, which sure would've made Fox feel guilty if it had canceled the show prematurely. John Ritter was nominated for lead actor in a comedy series for the three episodes of "8 Simple Rules" he appeared in before he died last year, which sure made God feel guilty for snatching Ritter off the face of the earth prematurely.  For Pierluigi:   It also sucks that "Deadwood" wasn't nominated for drama series, nor was Ian McShane nominated for lead actor in a drama series. I guess we'll just have to wait for the Salon TV Awards, which are far more trustworthy, since I'll have some say in them.  On "The Great Race" as couples therapy:    Donny : "Dealing with Alison was the hardest part of the race for me. On the race, like, I hated her. I can't believe I'm here with her. I'd rather change partners than be with her. So this race has really taught me to redefine my love for Alison."   Redefine it as  hate , in other words?   You have to adore a show that teaches long-term couples to find that core of hate beneath layer upon layer of niceties and hand-holding and rented movies and play dates with their other long-term-couple friends. Why enter into months of grueling therapy when all it takes to find out the truth is a little high-pressure travel?  On Alex Trebek:   I'm not sure Alex has that many friends.  On David picking up a creepy hitchiker on  Six Feet Under :   "Don't pick that guy up!" we all screamed at him -- charitable of us, when you consider that we actually encouraged Lisa to go swimming in the hope that she'd drown. But David didn't listen! I mean, we love David, we want to have, like, a million of his babies.   And finally, on how much she loves the show and hates the world:   Still, I love "Six Feet Under," darkness and all. I want to have, like, a million of its babies. One of my less masochistic associates expressed dismay over the horrors of last night's episode, declaring it "difficult" and "not fun at all." To him I said:   "Navigating in this twisted slag-heap of a world is  difficult  and  not fun at all , you naive little buttercup! Wake up and smell the Very Dark human toast burning all around you! Smell it! Stand up, and  smell  the burning flesh of the common man as the modern world goes up in flames!   "And while you're up, grab me a soda from the fridge. With a glass of ice. Crushed. And a straw."

       urlLink  Ben asks me to compile a Top Ten Presidents of the United States of America List , and flirts with me by saying that I have "insight/smarts/whatevs."  I vote for whatevs, personally, but that's just me.  I accept this challenge, but request a bit of time to compile the list -- and in fact, it may emerge as two lists, one of presidents who I think were the most effective and one of those who I personally admire the most.  There would be considerable overlap, but there is at least one (and probably two) presidents who would loom large on the first list but not on the second.  That being said, expect my insightful/smart/whatevs commentary sometime later today/early tomorrow.  Thanks for the challenge Ben.  I'll think one up more suited to your meager intellect and throw it back at you.

       urlLink Arianna Huffington  puts together a handy list of Bush's major policy flip-flops. I can't think of a single major issue (except tax cuts) on which Bush hasn't held contradictory positions, particularly when faced with dropping poll numbers. Sure, Kerry tries to have it both ways a lot, but Bush beats Clinton hands-down for sheer range of positions. Arianna puts it nicely:   He's reversed course more times than Capt. Kirk battling Khan in the midst of the Mutara Nebula. Gone back on his word more times than Tony Blundetto. Flip-flopped more frequently than a blind gymnast with an inner-ear infection. . . In fact, Bush's entire Iraq misadventure has been one big, costly, deadly flip-flop:   We didn't need more troops, then we did. We didn't need more money, then we did. Preemption was a great idea -- on to Syria, Iran and North Korea! Then it wasn't -- hello, diplomacy! Baathists were the bad guys, then Baathists were our buds. We didn't need the U.N., then we did.  And all this from a man who, once upon a time, made "credibility" a key to his appeal. (Well, in his defense, he's never lied about oral sex.)  Now, God knows, I have no problem with changing your mind -- so long as you admit that you have and can explain why. But Bush steadfastly -- almost comically -- refuses to admit that there's been a change, even when the entire world can plainly see otherwise. He's got his story and he's sticking to it. But that darn Kerry, he keeps shifting his positions!   [Editorial Update: Please note, Urby, the correct use of an ellipsis above.]

      Salon's got a  urlLink  double-review  of Dale Peck's   Hatchet Jobs  and James Wood's   The Irresponsible Self: On Laughter and the Novel .  I don't know how many of you know Wood, but he's everything Peck is not.  Subtle and clearly committed to an aesthetic project, just for starters.  They both, however, hate the Lit Boys.  Both can be vicious, but somehow Wood's criticism makes more sense.  His tastes are clear, for one thing.  He is clearly a partisan of the Ivory Tower: "The only success is aesthetic, and the 'culture' will never validate aesthetic success, will never 'engage' with that."  Contemporary novelists "flatter the culture the novel is supposed to resist."  This notion of the novel as a tool of political resistance is perhaps overheated, but anyone who reads contemporary fiction will find it filled with voices that seek, like the gay marriage movement, to simply   blend in.   Writers who resist culture, who let their works be aggressive and angry, are dismissed as being self-indulgent.  Still, Laura Miller, who wrote the review, doesn't care much for Mr. Wood.  In response to Wood's criticism of a passage from Franzen, she writes caustically: "[T]he passage conveys just the sort of revelation that Wood would marvel over if it instead described Sicilian peasants or the withering remnants of the pre-Revolutionary Russian aristocracy."  And her poisonous praise comes down to "he's brilliant, but boring," : "Wood does this beautifully, he erects a critical structure that's undeniably coherent; you can walk in and have a look around. It's just that once you get inside, the accommodations turn out to be pretty Spartan and the window shades are always pulled down."  Peck gets the Miller treatment too, of course: " the emotional tone here most powerfully suggests the diary of a bright but angry 14-year-old girl. It is petulant and muddled and, underneath that, hurt."  And, in the end, Wood is worth far more than Peck because, " you wind up [at an impasse] with Peck, but not with Wood. Wood's criticism enriches the understanding of those who don't agree with him; Peck's is content to stoke the righteous indignation of those who do."  I like both Peck and Wood and their criticisms of fiction, but I don't now how far down their road I can go.  Both reject the expansive cultural novel, but some of the very finest of novels are exactly of this sort (  The Tin Drum ,   Midnight's Children  and perhaps the finest novel of the last decade   The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay  come to mind).  Still, I can't get enough of their brand of reckless criticism.

      So, I decided to take other Quizilla quizzes and found this particularly bizzarre one: &nbsp;   Ice wolf. An Ice wolf is as cruel as the night wolf. They seem to have a flirtatious elegance that draws many others creatures near its beauty. This species will be sly and cunning. Some people even say their eyes are as shiny as a crystal. Even though a magnificent&nbsp; wolf of ice has a piercing howl that will lure many into a trance it is the one wolf with the most depressed heart. Dont forget whenever you see snow, remember the ice wolf might be there.If you got the special ice wolf then you have all the mysteries of ice at your disposal. What power and endurance,truly amazing.   urlLink   What Elemental Wolf Are You? (with pics/read memo)   &nbsp; Do you really think I'm as a cruel as the night wolf?&nbsp; The best part about this quiz were the answers to questions.&nbsp; For instance, there was "What kind of weapon would you carry?" and one option was "A thorny whp made of vines."&nbsp; And for the question "What do you think when someone says 'love,'" was the answer "Tears of blood that burn my flesh like acid."

      Pierluigi points out that  urlLink  strangers  are reading the blog.  I was super pleased with their comments, especially those of Isabella who hates me and gets all wet when she reads about gay men spanking each other.  Problem is, neither "Isabella" (who shall henceforth be known as  urlLink  The She Wolf of France. ) nor "Knott" have available profiles so I can't know anything about them.  Now I know what it feels like to be powerless before the public.  Like  urlLink  Pierluigi , I'm also having comment posting difficulties.  Blogger sends them to me in the e-mail, and I received one from Urban to my post on Mattie rising from the poetic grave.  It was an awesome comment.  But if you look at the "comments" for that post, nothing is there.  Most frustrating.  Therefore, I'll post his comments here, for all to enjoy:   I especially enjoyed this:  Mattie Stepanek is the literary equivalent of five dollar red wine. Sure it's sweet and adorable, but wouldn't you rather have something with a little maturity and kick?  ha. matty can't kick because he's in a wheelchair. you are at your best when making fun of this boy.   -- Posted by Urban to Fagistan at 7/14/2004 04:21:42 PM  In my defense, I am not "making fun of this boy."  I am defending the Poetry Castle from the invading crippled hordes, shining blade raised over my head, blood dripping from a dozen gashes as I valiantly hack my way through crutches, wheelchairs and shitty, shitty verse.

      A wasp was in my house yesterday and it was weird.  I was looking for information on what kind of wasp it was, so I entered the following phrase into Google: "wasp very slim waist" and got a link  urlLink  this site.   The premise of said site is that   les Amis d'ABC  in Victor Hugo's   Les Miserables  were orgiastic homos.  A sample of the fine prose:  Why should I, Jehan? You want this."   "No. No. Please."    I might have believed him if he hadn't thrust against me with every word. Instead, I matched each of his thrusts with a slap and kept up the rhythm. "What if I'd brought home ten people? You'd let them all see you like this, whomever it was, wouldn't you? And more than that. I know you, Jehan. I know just how much this drives you mad and how much you want me to stop and fuck you. You want it, don't you?"   "Yes. Please --" His voice was growing hoarse. "Please, Christophe."   "Shameless boy. I could tie you to the bed right now and you'd beg us all for it."   "Yes. Oh, God." He tightened his hands in the bedspread and thrust harder, getting close to orgasm.   "Wouldn't you be pretty with your bright red ass in the air and your legs open wide, getting fucked hard and begging for it until we can't stand the sound and someone takes your mouth. I should have brought ten more for you, boy, so we could keep you on your knees all night long."

      As we all know, I find Mickey Kaus to be grating, obnoxious and childish in his mostly ill-thought and ill-written attacks on John Kerry.  I can barely manage to read his blog for the simple fact that he seems to think that the ". . . " counts as clever punctuation.  He uses it as a comma, as a period, as a semicolon, as a dash.  On occasion he even uses it properly (to imply the omission of part of a quote, or to end an unfinished rhetorical sentence.)  It's like he understands that he can't write a column on his blog, because that wouldn't be "bloggy" but can't figure out a way to break up his long sentences, so he falls back on good ole dot dot dot.  But now Kaus has gone a step further in his crusade to make me use my time machine to kill him in the womb.  The title of a post critical of Barbara Ehrenreich is:  urlLink  "There's a little Reich in every Ehrenreich."   In Kaus's defense, he carries "Reich" as a link to an article critical of the lone liberal lion in the Clinton Administration, Labor Secretary Robert Reich.  The connection is made only via link though and not in Kaus's text.  The clear implication of the post, without reading the link, is that Kaus is making a comparison to a very different Reich.  He is, at least this time, pretty clever, able to slip in a good old Nazi reference and building in the perfect defense.  "I didn't call her a Nazi, I compared her to Bob Reich."  But the worst part is that he focuses on her statistical analysis (which is presented in an Op-Ed column at the NYT after all and therefore not exactly subject to the standards of real journalists, like Kaus's blog, for instance) and not on the actual content of the column, which is that the Bush Administrations decision to devote a non-paltry sum of tax-payer money to "educating" the poor on marriage will not actually make their lives any better, that marriage is rarely a solution to the economic woes of the poor, and that maybe there is a little inconsistency in the President pushing added benefits on straight marriage while doing his best to end any hope of gay marriage.  It's nauseating to me.  Bloggers shouldn't allow links to tell their stories, especially not if they are acting as journalists.  I won't click the link unless context gives me some reason to anticipate what is there, and in this case no context is given.  Or maybe it was simply buried in an ellipsis.  In fact, I begin to think that all common sense, decency and goodness Kaus might exhibit personally has been likewise hidden behind his cute strings of periods, leaving us only with raw intelligence, heartlessness, savagery, and Bush-fever.

      I, like  urlLink  Tim , am "In The Middle" in Slate's little  urlLink  "Quiz."   I don't know what that means, since states are either Red or Blue (Purple is not an option.)  The reason I'm "in the middle" though is that I knew the answers to basically every question (I was raised a Blue-state boy in a Red State world.)  But some of these questions are clearly fucked up.  Most especially the fact that questions relating to the Midwest are all "Red."  1. The Quad-Cities (Moline, Davenport, Bettendorf and Rock Island) are in Iowa and Illinois.  Blue States. 2. The Upper Pennisula of Michigan is in, duh, Michigan.  A Blue State. 3. Door County is in Wisconsin, a Blue State (even if only barely.) 4. What hard-core Blue Staters don't know Dr. Laura or Jim Caviziel?  The only thing that made me happy was that answing "no" to the question "Have you ever fired a gun?" didn't give you Blue points.  But since "yes" gave you Red points, I guess it's still dumb. That one pushed me all up in to the Red zone and shit. I mean, California is a Blue State and tons of people there shoot guns all the time.  Every state has cops and they love shootin' the shit out of shit.  Boo, I say, boo.  This whole thing reminds me of those "which Presidential candidate should you pick" games in which they said I should pick Howard Dean or Dennis Kucinich.  Obviously it's fucking stupid.  There was never a question like "Do you think a wild-eyed maniac with no experience should be President?"  or "How do you feel about leprechauns ruling your nation with a tiny iron fist?"  No.  It was all "Is abortion a deep moral sin or is it totally tubular?"  and "Terrorists are: a) Evil doers  b) misunderstood misfits c) Arabs d) USA, Israel and Great Britain."

"What the fuck?" [in response to John Ashcroft singing a patriotic song]  "Toward the end he was saying don't let our soldiers die there while the richer people don't send their kids to the military. At the end he wants you to think, 'These are our kids.' He started off with us as crazy killers ... What are we? I didn't understand what we are."

      Salon has recently published a spate of articles critical of Ralph Nader (I've linked to virtually all of them) and now Nader is angry at these "smear-pieces."  He recently had a 3-way phone conversation with David Talbot and Kevin Zeese (Nader's spokesbator).  It begins with angry accusations that Salon made no attempt to contact him, despite the fact that Zeese was interviewed for one of the articles and the other journalist claims she made dozens of unreturned phone calls to various campaign staffers.  So, Nader makes himself unavailable, then accuses Talbot of not presenting a fair article because he didn't take the extra step to "write a letter," when it was clear that phone calls weren't being returned.  I'm sure if the journalists were really fair they'd have sent off notes on scented paper, the i's dotted with hearts and Dear Ralph written in bubble letters in purple sparkle pen.  I'm also sure he'd certainly respond to a letter, which is more time-consuming than a voice mail.  Then Nader uses his usual duck move (Down, A, B on a Nintendo controller) when confronted with the fact that his book was published by Rupert Murdoch and that he is accepting huge donations and other material support from Right Wing groups that don't support his causes.  He fires back with "Why don't you insist the Democrats return the money."  Talbot responds "Aren't you suppose to have higher standards?"  That's exactly the point.  From Nader's perspective, Democrats should take big corporate donations because they have the same agenda as Republicans.  But how can Nader claim to be the only candidate free of corporate influence if he's taking Right Wing Republican money?  And not just from the usual suspects, but from Murdoch and the Oregon Family Council and other deeply disturbing extremists.  When Talbot charges that these groups just maybe want to use Nader to defeat Kerry, Nader says: "Wait, wait, wait. Working to get someone on the ballot is working to give someone their free speech. I have no problem with that."  Here we go again.  Suddenly the First Amendment guarantees all Americans a space on the Presidential ballot.  Frankly, I've seen no evidence that a multi-party system is any more democratic than a two-party system, but even if it were this is a ridiculous argument.  I would fight aggressively to defend the Aryan Nation's right to publicly gather in a Jewish neighborhood.  I would not fight aggressively to get the head of the organization on the ballot.  Indeed, the ballot signature gathering procedure is meant to ensure democracy -- to ensure that candidates have some measure of popular support before being unleashed on the ballot.  Nader keeps hammering at Kerry for accepting corporate donations and Talbot returns with this inspired bit: "They're buying access to Kerry -- a man you have met with and honored, and said he's significantly better than Al Gore. But the reason they're giving money to you is not to buy access -- it's to keep Bush, a man you say [has been a disaster for the country], in the White House . . . They're not just giving money. These conservative groups are working behind the scenes to get you on state ballots. You're basically saying it's all right to work with the devil, Ralph, because you've lost your perspective."  But never fear, Ralph is "an expert in flushing out bias, prejudice and prejudgment," and kindly refuses a future interview because Talbot has "already prejudged" him and lied.  Talbot's "lie" was that some groups supporting Nader are antigay, which is true.  And, although Nader has flushed Talbot out, he also flushes himself out as he starts breathing heavily into the phone, a Liddy light so far up his ass he can taste it, his boner growing to such immense proportions that Talbot should sue for sexual assault.  Here is the incredible finale to the interview, in which Nader's crazy eye and his inability to use a dictionary, (perhaps he should take Pier's advice and use OneLook to find the definition of "dictatorship") take on whole new proportions:  Nader: We're not going to play the fascist game of the two-party monopoly barricading itself from any competition, with all kinds of statutory obstruction that cost third parties immense time and money if they can surmount them. This is a dictatorship, which you don't seem to understand...   Talbot: I...   Nader: I've got another phone call, I've got to go. Bye-bye.

      I was going to write a bit about this last week, but the blogger was all f'ed hardcore and wouldn't let me.  A study recently came out saying that only about 48% of Americans read literature and only 57% read "any book at all" in 2002.  This number is depressing enough on its face, but remember that it comes on the heels of the enormous success of the Oprah Book Club and Harry Potter, the DaVinci Code and other "fad books."  What this means is that most Americans who read, read only one book a year.  And it's a shitty one.  A lot of literature types are quite sad about this.  I suppose I am too, except that I'm not at all.  I think that the addition of the Internet to list of reasons people don't read is indicative of how traditional culture has failed to integrate electronic media.  Doesn't using the internet at all require one to read?  And don't many people spend endless hours reading online?  In fact, although e-mail has done its fair share of damage to things like spelling and grammar, it also represent a rebirth of writing as a form of casual communication, bringing an end to the post-letter, pre-internet Age of King Telephone.  And isn't there some blame, in fact a good deal of blame, to be laid at the feet of the strongest supporters of Literature as Art?  Almost no "serious" novelists, much less critics, are willing to embrace the masses as a market.  Think about that hideous incident when Jonathan Franzen refused to appear on Oprah because it would "demean" his work to have it recognized by so popular a figure.  Or how about the howls of fury that rose up when a special National Book Award was given to one of the most enduring figures of pop literature, Stephen King.  How can we expect the People to read when writers openly despise them?  We'd prefer no one read King, but reading contemporary high literature (and even much of the literature of the 20th century) requires a kind of discipline and training that even people with a college education often lack.  The people doing most of the whining are the ones who should be celebrating.  They've finally managed to purge the reading world of real people and replace with them miniature clones of Dave Eggers and Harold Bloom.  So, all in all, I mostly agree with  urlLink  Charles Taylor.   Still, I hate his article.  Taylor is a terrible film critic and is even worse, if imaginable, when tackling non-film topics, and yet for some reason Salon loves to play "Let's See What Else Charles Taylor Knows Nothing About."  Taylor is tired of literati blaming visual culture (specifically television and movies) for the decline of literature.  He is certainly right to point out that there is such a thing as visual literacy and that watching a movie is not necessarily passive (as reading is not necessarily engaging).  This passage puts it nicely:  You no more plop down in front of Jean-Luc Godard's "La Chinoise" than you just pick up "Ulysses." Reading can be the cheapest pulp as easily as the greatest literature, and the latter can be a washout if we choose to be lazy when we're reading it. Looking can be "The Rules of the Game" or "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken." It doesn't even have to divide along a high-low split (usually a false division anyway). Someone who lazily watches the "good television" that even Solomon acknowledges is going to be baffled by a lot of pop culture. Try to follow the labyrinthine plot of "Alias" or "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" without paying attention.  The problem is that the "visual culture" absolutely   is  to blame for the decline of literature.  We can't really blame the literary establishment for declines in reading rates.  Literati may well want to purge commoners from the ranks of readers of "great" books, but their condescension does not stop people from reading the endless parade of  urlLink  Dragonlance  novels, or Grisham or Clancy or King or Steele.  And yet, people have turned away even from these writers.  Television is obviously more compelling, whether or not one is a passive participant.  And, as I've written at length before, cinema is the predominant narrative artistic form in our culture.  Therefore, there is a steady decline of real literary talent that coincides neatly with the rise of film as a true "art" in the 1970s (in America that is).  Imagine what novels we'd have if Lynch, Cronenberg, the Andersons, Woody Allen, Kubrick and Altman existed in a parallel universe without cinema?  What we end up with are the left-over dregs of would-be filmmakers cramming together kaleidoscopic, image-heavy text that defies the interiority of earlier literature.  Literature no longer really exists within its own traditional framework because we now find ourselves aping filmmakers, just as early filmmakers (Eisenstein in particular) aped novelists.  Taylor may be feeling defensive, unwilling to admit that the medium he is paid to critique has done irreparable harm to an earlier art form.  But he shouldn't be.  There is nothing wrong or new in this trend.  As the novel exploded into the forefront of narrative art in the Twentieth Century, poetry was at first paralyzed and unable to move forward, then moved forward in grotesque imitation of novelistic forms and then finally broke free into the glorious expanses of Eliot, Pound, Plath and Sexton, finding a new voice after its submission to the new form.  The novel can do the same.  We just have to weather our way through a few more decades of Wallace and Franzen before we get our Eliot.  In the mean time, Harold Bloom and Charles Taylor should both shut their god damn yap-holes.  Eat some fucking pie, assknobs.  I have some reading to do.  [Editorial update: Okay, so we do know what novels we'd have if Woody Allen didn't make movies.  We call them works by Philip Roth]

      I will never be President.  I have long come to accept this, but in case I had any doubt of it, this  urlLink  piece at Slate  has finally driven the nail in the coffin, so to speak.  Here is one example of the kind of archived e-mails and letters we'll find for future Presidents:  Darling Muffin, I love America. I love capitalism. I guess I've realized how important the core values of this great country are. That's why, when you go to the store later, I want you to pick up imported beer. If the best beer is made overseas, we should buy it, drink it, then learn to make even better stuff ourselves. That's what's great about this country; we're not afraid to be the best, or compete against it. I don't think I fully understood that before. I've come a long way in my thinking. Get pizza rolls too. Love,  Matt —Note to [name redacted], 1994.  In light of this stunning act of time-travelling, I find that I need to start inserting the words 'I love America' more often into my commentary.  Here are ten things I especially love about America:  1. Bill Cosby 2. The white race 3. rivers 4. Urban gentrification 5. The fact that we have no class distinctions 6. Mattie Stepanek is dead 7. The Supreme Court loves porno 8. Taco Bell 9. More Americans were rightly offended by Janet Jackson's nipple than voted in the 2000 election 10.  urlLink  Real Dolls.   I love you America,  Joshua  Gibson, President of the Fagnited States

      Ann Hulbert, author of Slate's  urlLink  Sandbox  column, writes about literary precocity and sort of reviews a few books written by teenagers and makes references to works written a century ago by children as young as nine.  One of these teenagers is Christopher Paolini, who wrote a fantasy novel called   Eragon .  I've not read it, but he's from Montana, so I feel a bit of pride that he's become a bestselling novelist while only 19 (he wrote the book when he was 15.)  Hulbert's problem comes in when she chooses to lump Mattie Stepanek in with "precocious writers."  Precocity implies, by its very nature, talent and maturity beyond one's years.  Mattie's poems did mature as he grew older (the truly vile pieces I published when he died were from his first collection), but they were never better that what other kids his age were writing.  Mr. Paolini self-published his novel until a real publisher found it.  That requires at least some degree of talent.  Paolini, after all, does not suffer from a sympathetic illness.  Lumping an obvious no-talent hack in a wheelchair with real prodigies is demeaning to those with actual talent.  And don't try to say that I just think people with illnesses get special treatment.  Flannery O'Connor is the greatest writer of short fiction in the English language.  She was a young and precocious (though not teenaged) talent.  She suffered an agonizing and long death from lupus.  But the fact is, her illness was never a benefit to her popularity.  People didn't fawn over her, because she was grown up and not that pretty and because her writing was so bleak and vicious that her German publisher thought it was "too brutal" for German tastes.  She became a great writer in   spite  of her illness, not a best-selling writer   because  of it.  The fact that the American reading public has such an undying taste for shitty writing and heartwarming pap is just a testament to our centuries-long love affair with sentiment.  Mattie Stepanek is the literary equivalent of five dollar red wine. Sure it's sweet and adorable, but wouldn't you rather have something with a little maturity and kick?  Now the wine is gone, and with it the metaphor.  Mattie is now a shambling zombie-poet, his gnarled, rotty hands reaches out to strangle us into submission.  His poetry, even with the poet believed to be safely buried six feet down, cuts off our oxygen and leaves us unable to appreciate real poetry.  Mattie Stepanek wants to eat your brain, so do not sleep, and keep a rusty shovel at your shoulder ready to knock his half-decayed head from his bony shoulders.  The touch of the zombie is death, my friends.  I hope at least one of us will be alive for the end credits.

      1. Lynne Cheney: The woman whose time at the National Endowment for the Humanities was marked by aggressive hostility to intellectual diversity now becomes the only person vaguely associated with George Bush's administration to  urlLink  oppose the Federal Marriage Amendment.   Mrs. Cheney's call for federalism only emphasizes how far from "traditional" conservative values Bush's administration has gone.  Indeed, Lynne might as well have said "The Bush Administration is the 'faggot marriage' of the Republican Party."  2. Portland International Beer Fest: On Sunday I spent a lazy afternoon sampling 25 or so beers from around the world.  These beers ranged from the utterly delicious (Wychwood's Hobgoblin) to the extremely bad (Salopian Entire Butt Porter: rad name, but tastes like ice tea).  By Sunday they were out of some of the varieties I was most excited about, including dandelion ale and a Trappist stout that would have been both a yummy and a religious experience.  Also of note: In the park the event was held in there is a continuosly running drinking fountain for dogs, at ground level, shaped like a waterdish.   Posted at various places in the beer fest were large city ordinance signs reading "NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES ALLOWED."  I ran into a really hot guy I went to high school with who clearly had no idea who I was but who was hot and polite nonetheless.  3.  urlLink  The Worst Comics Ever .  A little selection put together by James Lileks.  The talking piano is my favorite.  Also, go back a bit on the page to see other old comics (including a great series of ads for Ex-Lax starring the laxative gnomes, the Laxies, and some incredibly funny shit from 1907)  4.  urlLink  Westboro Baptist Church's website  and, in particular,  urlLink  this flier .  I love sodomite whorehouses and fag-enablers.  I also love eating feces.  This may be an old standby, but so reliable for up-to-date fag coverage.

       urlLink  Dean and Nader mix it up in DC.   Dean might be an apoplectic, hypocritical, idiot manbeast, but he does know how to aim for the nuts.  Poor Nader.  So hard to defend your record of grass-roots democratic action when its revealed that you encourage the support of mouth-frothing Right Wingers, isn't it?  And so sad when your only argument for third party action is "It's about freedom."  Okay.  Everyone in America is, indeed, free to run a megalomaniacal, masturbatory campaign.  But how does   your  freedom give   us  a better democracy?  What?  It's not about us?  It's just about you?  Sorry, I was confused for a minute.  Thought we were talking about democracy.

      I wrote all that shit about Riordan before I got to the fucking best part:  A group of civil rights organizations, including the NAACP, planned to protest Riordan's remarks at the Capitol Thursday.   But the organizer, Democratic state Assemblyman Mervyn Dymally, canceled the protest after an apparent mix-up over the girl's racial background.   Dymally was quoted in the San Jose Mercury News Thursday saying the child was "a little African-American girl. Would he (Riordan) have done that to a white girl?"   The girl is white, with blonde hair.  You know, if a white person assumed the girl was black because she has a weird first name that happens to be of Egyptian derivation, the NAACP would be pissed.  Which to hate more: knee-jerk identity politics or children?  I can't decide . . .

      From the  urlLink  what the fuck was he thinking? file  comes this story about former LA Mayor Riordan:   The conversation, videotaped by KEYT-TV, took place Thursday at a promotional event for summer reading at Santa Barbara's central library. The unidentified girl, who appeared to be a preschooler, asked Riordan if he knew that her name meant "Egyptian goddess."   Riordan replied, "It means stupid dirty girl."   After nervous laughter in the room, the girl again told Riordan the meaning of her name.   "Hey, that's nifty," he said.   A day later, Riordan issued a statement that said he "teased" the girl. "I immediately apologized to her, and I want to do so again for the misunderstanding," Riordan said.  The Sacramento   Bee  is not amused:  But the issue has persisted. In an editorial Thursday, The Sacramento Bee said California "shouldn't have an education secretary who makes offensive, damaging remarks to young children for no apparent reason."  I don't care about the   Bee , I only care about me.  And I am most definitely   amused!   I think children need to have more degrading things said to them by secretaries of education.  If that was my job that's all I'd do all day.  Children are nasty, hateful little maggots and should not be allowed to think of themselves positively.  "Self-esteem" is for pussies!  I hate myself and my life is kick-ass.  Once, my math teacher refused to hang my project in the hallway because it was "too bad."  Did I go crying to the NAACP?  No.  I simply grew up to be a depressed college alcoholic with suicidal ideation.  Being mean to children is one of the few pleasures afforded by being an adult.  And whoever the fuck named their daughter "Isis" shouldn't be all shocked that someone made fun of it.  The only mistake Riordan made was not adding "ugly and slutty" to the list.  And who the fuck does she think she is, wasting the secretary's time by telling him what her name means?  Who the fuck cares?  I don't even care if it means "shit-pie."  Shut your damn mouth and go play with some dollies.  Jesus.  Why do people encourage their children to speak?  If I lived in   Gattaca , I'd make sure they jiggered my kids' genes so they'd have no tongues or voice boxes.  When this little thing grows up she's going to have the best story to tell her college roommates.  "Richard Riordan called me stupid and dirty," is a pretty kick-ass ice breaker for all those beginning of class rituals that made me wish my colon would prolapse so I could get out of it.  Basically, what I'm saying here is, Riordan should've run in the special election instead of Schwarzenegger.  He can ask Dirty Stupid Girl to be his running mate.

      From  urlLink  Politic1  via  urlLink  Salon's War Room .  After gathering nearly five thousand petition signatures that were improperly filed because they lacked a Vice Presidential candidate, a group of Nader supporters tried again.  Too bad Nader punchfucked them:  According to Vaughan [an organizer of Nevada Independents, the pro-Nader organization], they collected over 14,000 signatures -- far more than the 5,000 required by the July 9 filing deadline. Yet, when Nader's national campaign learned of the group's efforts in mid-June, they explicitly disavowed them. 'They're acting on their own...They're collecting signatures for somebody who's not really running [for VP]. We disavow that activity,' said Nader spokesman Kevin Zeese. The comments were especially odd as Nader's campaign had itself been using a surrogate VP candidate in other states. What explains the strangely arrogant conduct from the Nader camp? Answer: Nader apparently thought he would get on the Nevada ballot as the Green nominee -- so he figured he didn't need Vaughan's group -- but then Nader failed to win the Green nomination. In the interim, Nader also picked financial executive Peter Camejo (Green-CA) as his official VP runningmate last month. That move angered the Nevada Independents, who explicitly reject Camejo as 'unacceptable' and 'a commie.' Vaughan told Politics1 that the Nader campaign desperately contacted the group a few days ago to see if they could now use the petitions that Nader had previously disavowed. 'Nevada Independents disavow Ralph Nader after his selection of Peter Camejo as a Vice Presidential choice...Nader with Camejo now seems too radical even for the diverse radicals in the US...Nader will not be on the Nevada ballot...The treatment of Nevada Independents by the Nader campaign may spell a possible victory for Kerry in the state,' explained Vaughan.  Don't worry, Lefties, Nader doesn't just hate Kerry and Bush, he hates you too!  Even if Nader doesn't like this particular organization, why not let them do his work for him?  He was willing to acccept pro-Bush Republicans at his convention in Oregon, after all.  But, hey, being Nader's friend is worse than being his enemy.

      First I read Ann Coulter's anti-Caesarian screed (linked to below), and now I find Salon has an article devoted to the  urlLink  dramatic increase in C-sections.   Ann, you will remember, blames John Edwards for this rise.  She claims that his contention that a client's child's cerebral palsy was caused by neglect, i.e. the doctors did not perform a C-section when the child's heart rate plummeted, has caused doctors to insist on performing them unncessarily.  She calls this "junk science," but it appears to be fairly standard medical practice.  The Salon article explains a good deal of the increase as stemming from "elective" Caesarian birth.  Of course, Ann doesn't want women to have any reproductive choices, so I guess it's convenient for her to overlook this trend.  OB/GYNs are split on the issue.  Many seem to think elective C-sections are good, since 20% of women who go into labor end up having C-sections anyway, and if they are scheduled and done before labor the complications are dramatically lessened, including infection rates.  Also, women who deliver vaginally run much higher risks of urinary incontinence and uterine prolapse (that's when her uterus plops right on out of her pussy.  Hot.)  Anyway, I don't have an opinion or need one.  I'm not a woman, I won't ever get a woman pregnant and I'll never been a obstetrician.  That being said, this story does give me a chance to talk about my mother's vagina, which I am always into.  Both my brother and myself were delivered by Caesarean.  In my case it was a planned C-section, and in my brother's case it was unplanned.  My mother went into labor naturally, went to the hospital, waiting for 20 hours or so, the doctors realized she wasn't dilating properly, so they used labor inducive medication on her to speed up the process.  She remained in induced, extremely hard labor for the next 48 hours and did not dilate a fraction more.  At this point, the doctors determined that she had scar tissue preventing cervical dilation and so they sliced by bro right out of that shit.  So when she was knocked up time number deuce, they just decided I was "due" on the 13th of May and cut her open and slipped me out.  I realize that among people my age, this makes me a rarity.  The pride I felt in learning that Macduff was a C-section baby was immense.  But I guess in the future it won't be so special to be a man who "was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd"  It is the end of an era, when C-sections become as common as liposuction.  Soon they will invent a giant metallic womb that can grow the baby in a vat and end the need of uteruses altogether.  Until then, all you hetero boys better get ready to be turned on my C-section scars.  On another personal family note . . . My father also had a radical stomach surgery when his ulcer bled out and nearly killed him.  60% of his stomach was removed, although he was only the size of Carnie Wilson's thigh.  As a result, both he and my mother have matching abdominal scars.  I can't wait until they discover that I'm a hermaphrodite and have to cut out my shriveled, vestigial uterus.  Then I can look like my parents.  As for being a hermaphrodite [sorry this post is all over the place, but I'm bored]: I have a cleft palate. This doesn't seem very hermy, and indeed it is not.  However, when I was born my mother was understandably concerned about other birth defects. The doctors told her that the most common defects to come in tandem with maxillo-facial disorders (cleft palates, lips etc.) are genital.  Since my testes had descended and my penis was fine, they weren't worried.  My mother never told me that I had only narrowly escaped some kind of fucked up penis with a piss slit on the side or something until after I came out to her.  Then she told me about the genital problems.  Later, I would meet another person with the same cleft that I have, who was also named Josh and is also gay.  It does make me wonder . . .

      This post is not about Laura Bush's genitals.  But now that I'm thinking about them, I imagine they are small and soft, slighty-mounded with tightly curled brown hair and an almond-like aroma.  Wow.  I think I just did the naughty in my shorts.  But seriously, dudes.  I was reading another newfound blog that I love,  urlLink  Welcome to Blog  and it got to me to thinking of genitals.  [and Laura Bush, but only due to his nifty web address.]  Why?  Because of this line from his long, rambly post on travelling to Vancouver to buy fireworks (Fort Vancouver, in Vancouver, WA has the largest fireworks display west of the Mississippi.  For those not from the Portland area, the 'Couve is just over the river from Portland.): "There was just one little problem. No one had thought to pick-up so much as a sparkler. Hitting the beach without a full cache of illegal explosives would be like going to an orgy without genitals."

      The Willamette Week has a rundown of Portland bloggers (including someone that I actually personally know, but do not care for that much, who goes by the ridiculous name "the One True b!x.") and one of them is Julianne Shepherd, the music editor at  urlLink  the Mercury.   Her blog,  urlLink  Cowboyz 'n' Poodles  is pretty rad.  Especially rad is this post about her coworkers interview with decidedly odd  urlLink  Jonathan Ames. :  My coworker Katie: "Did you ever get in trouble for the part in your book where Margaret Thatcher comes into the restaurant where you work, and you masturbate into her food?"  Jonathan Ames: "I didn't write that."  Katie: "Are you sure? I've been telling everyone to read your book because that part is so funny."  Jonathan Ames: "I have a terrible memory, but I am positive I did not write that."  Katie: "But yours the only book I've read in months. I think I would remember."  Jonathan Ames: "No, I am sure that is not in my book."

      One can easily forget, when perusing Sid Blumenthal's mostly knee-jerk, pseudo-leftist rhetoric in Salon, that he is one of the sharpest thinkers on political strategy around.  He has  urlLink  written a column just for Urby,  explaining the importance of the South to the Democratic Party.  Here are the best bits:  Just as Edwards underscores the endurance of the Southern Democratic tradition, so does he underscore the dead end of conservatism in the person of Dick Cheney. The thread of the Southern Democratic tradition that now runs through Edwards opposes the one represented by President Bush and Vice President Cheney. These Southern politics have been in conflict since President Andrew Jackson split with his vice president, the original theoretician of Southern reaction, John Calhoun. The Jacksonian slogan was "opportunity for all, special privilege for none." But the Calhoun wing of the party triumphed, leading to the Civil War, eventually the end of Reconstruction, and the long rule of the Bourbons, or local oligarchs, who maintained their power under the rubric of states' rights against federal authority. African-Americans were disenfranchised under Jim Crow, and poor whites, sharecroppers and mill hands like Edwards' father and grandfather were manipulated by racial fears and a hatred of intruding Yankees like Kerry's ancestors.  The Bourbon Democratic Party of the South came to an end with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Republicans, no longer the party of Abraham Lincoln, absorbed the new conservatism that followed, converting the once solid Democratic South into the solid Republican South. But the Republican project was never as stable as it seemed. In 1976, Jimmy Carter carried most of the South, and twice Bill Clinton broke off important states and moved them into the Democratic column. Now this mantle, worn by Clinton and Carter, and before them Lyndon Johnson and Harry Truman, falls on the shoulders of Edwards.  Indeed, Mr. Blumenthal.  Down with the Bourbons and up with  urlLink  Bourbon.  And, on how very tenuous the Republican grasp on the South really is:  [Bush] requires a nearly unanimous white vote to compensate for the Democrats' nearly unanimous African-American vote. If more than one-quarter to one-third of the white vote goes into the Democratic coalition, depending on the state, the Republicans lose.  The solid Republican South must have a solid white vote in every Southern and border state without exception to maintain a Republican in the White House. A crack anywhere topples the entire edifice. That fragility accounts for the ferocious struggle in Florida.

      With typically convenient amnesia, Ann Coulter  urlLink  forgets she's a lawyer.   Okay, so actually she hates Edwards because he's a trial lawyer.  Apparently she thinks that there should be no trials. Or at least none with lawyers.  Welcome to Ann Coulter's Star Chamber, everyone.  No, there should only be lawyers who use their law degrees to become "legal analysts," on TV, get a syndicated column, and then have someone make a talking doll out of you.  Still, she does get in a few good ones as she winds her merry, and incoherent, way through Edwards past:  What is so amazing about Edwards' father being a millworker? That's at least an honorable occupation -- as opposed to being a trial lawyer. True, Edwards made more money than his father did. I assume strippers make more money than their alcoholic fathers who abandoned them did, too. This isn't a story of progress; it's a story of devolution.  As funny as that line is, it just shows yet again that Ann has no respect for real working people.  But that's okay.  She also blames John Edwards for singlehandedly quadrupling the rates of Caesaerian sections in America.  Of course, she ignores the merits of the case, instead insisting that the general result (more C-sections) is so bad that the wronged family shouldn't have been compensated.  That's okay too.  Because Ann mocks Edwards's tactic of telling the jury that the girl born with cerebral palsy was speaking through him:  Is Edwards able to channel any children right before an abortionist's fork is plunged into their tiny skulls? Why can't he hear those babies saying, "Let me live! Stop spraying this saline solution all over me!" Edwards must experience interference in channeling the voices of babies about to be aborted. Their liberal mothers' hands seem to muffle those voices.  And she finishes off with an inspired   Rosemary's Baby  reference:  So while Michael Moore, Al Franken, George Soros, Crazy Al Gore and the rest of the characters from the climactic devil-worshipping scene in "Rosemary's Baby" provide the muscle for the Kerry campaign, Kerry picks a pretty-boy milquetoast as his running mate, narrowly edging out a puppy for the spot. Just don't ask the Democrats what they believe. Edwards' father was a millworker, and that's all you need to know.

      Twice a year my love for Thomas Jefferson hits a fever pitch in which I immerse myself in Jefferson's copious writings for days on end and emerge with a little more wisdom.  These times are his birthday, on April 13, and July 4.  Reading his letters makes me imagine a time when one might regularly receive beautifully written, long and intellectually rigorous letters from friends.  The Blogosphere is a beautiful thing, but it's just not as romantic.  Here are couple of passages from his correspondence which speak, with usual flair, to contemporary political issues.  Jefferson on suicide as a political act, and physician assisted suicide (in a letter to Dr. Samuel Brown, July 14, 1813):  It [the poison used by the French to avoid the guillotine] seems far preferable to the Venesection of the Romans, the Hemlock of the Greeks and the Opium of the Turks. . .  Could such a medicament be restrained to self-administration, it ought not to be kept secret.  There are ills in life as desperate as intolerable, to which it would be the rational relief, e.g. the inveterate cancer.  As a relief from tyranny indeed, for which the Romans recurred to it in the times of the emperors, it has been a wonder to me that they did not consider a poignard in the breast of the tyrant as a better remedy.  Jefferson on intellectual property rights (In a letter to Isaac McPherson, an inventor, August 13, 1813):  Stable ownership is the gift of social law [i.e. not a Natural Right], and is given late in the progress of society.  It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed exclusive and stable property.  If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. . . That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe . . . seems peculiarly designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over space, without lessening their density in any one point, or like the air in which we breathe, move and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.

       urlLink  Wonkette on Hitch. :  The NYDN peeks at Christopher Hitchens's Vanity Fair column and finds the Johnnie Walker enthusiast looking on the bright side: "That Bush did not surrender to the need for a colossal bourbon on Sept. 11 stands, I think to his credit." Right. So let's go to the official Bush presidency scoreboard. Pros: Did not get stinking drunk on 9/11. Cons: Started a war that has yet to be proven necessary. Could you send that Johnnie Walker over our way now?  I think that the fact that he didn't surrender to the need for a colossal bourbon is disappointing.  Who the hell wants a President who doesn't drink?  Still, I'm sure Ben's gonna get all pissy that Wonkette called Hitchens a drunk.

      She's got a weird thing from John Derbyshire, that I think  urlLink  speaks for itself. :  Isn't there a trend here? For each of the following ten pairs, identify the prettier one.   Kerry, Edwards G.W. Bush, Cheney Gore, Lieberman Clinton, Gore Dole, Kemp G.H.W. Bush, Quayle Dukakis, Bentsen Reagan, G.H.W. Bush Mondale, Ferraro Carter, Mondale  Coding P, V, or T as the prettier (Prez, Veep, or Tie), I make it V-T-P-V-V-V-P-P-V-V. Seems to me there is a definite bias towards looks in the selection of veeps.  Wonkette thinks it's crazy that Bush and Cheney are a "tie."  I think it's crazy that Gore is prettier than Clinton, or that Mondale is prettier than Carter.  John Derbyshire is way too gay to be gay.

      I recently read Thomas Jefferson's essay "On Anglo-Saxon," which displays yet another aspect of the man's incredible intellect.  The fact that more than half of the words he uses in discussing Anglo-Saxon grammar are unknown to me only made the essay that much more interesting.  Now, Christopher Hitchens joins Jefferson as a  urlLink  scholar of the Anglo-Saxon.   I have to admit that while Hitchens is no Jefferson (intellectually or otherwise) his linguistics are more enjoyable.  "Go fuck yourself," never sounded so sweet.  One minor quibble: Hitch criticizes Cheney's particular phrase because, "At points, it even seems to confuse the act of sexual intercourse with an act of aggression: a regrettable overlap to be sure."  I see no confusion here.  Sex and violence are so intertwined that it's impossible to pull them apart.  Call it "making love," all you want, it's still an aggressive act.  And why is aggression suddenly so regrettable to Hitch?  The lesson we learn from this gentle lover and war-monger is what exactly?  Aggression is admirable foreign policy, but regrettable in bed?  Who'd have thought Hitchens was such a prude?

      John Kerry made the best decision of his campaign this morning when he chose John Edwards to run at his side.  John Edwards made the best decision of his political career in accepting the spot.  I know I very recently endorsed Gephardt for the number two spot.  That came, I will note, after a long time supporting Edwards.  Iowa proved that Kerry and Edwards had the strongest support among Democrats and the ability to win over undecided voters.  Together they took a crushing majority in Iowa and I think they can turn that energy into a concerted effort to win over independent voters.  This moment, when campaigns reveal their running mates, is an exciting time for me.  It's almost impossible to guess who they will pick.  Part of the game is to pick someone no one expects -- which is why CNN's list of potential veeps included as many as 30 people, including the constitutionally problematic Bill Clinton.  I had myself settled on Phil Breseden, the Governor of Tennessee, as Kerry's secret choice.  But, the only thing surprising about this choice is that it is totally unsurprising.  Edwards has been the dominant choice of the party elite from the beginning.  Kerry wasn't as excited, but that's what primary rivalry will do for you.  Edwards is no out-of-the-blue choice like Lieberman, Kemp, Gore, Quayle or Ferraro.  But the reasons he's the obvious choice are so solid that it would have been foolish to choose anyone else.  Edwards is young and handsome, bringing a freshness to the campaign that it needs.  He's relentlessly optimistic, which will sink the Bush campaign's "pessimism" tactic once and for all.  He'll be fundraising gold.  He will charm his way into undecided hearts.  He's more seriously religious than Kerry, has a genuine working class background, and all the political skills we praise in VP nominees.  He's smooth, charming and vicious.  His opponents in court have always remarked that he is always polite, even when he's driving the dagger home.  Unlike Dean, whose savagery is uncontrolled, or Lieberman, who was too civilized, in Edwards we have a civilized savage who will rip Cheney's nuts out on debate night.  Most importantly, Edwards is a Southerner.  Whether this will swing any state, I can't say.  I think it has a chance of motivating large enough turn-out in heavily Democratic western Tennessee and many parts of Arkansas and W. Virginia to turn those states to Kerry.  What I do know is that Kerry probably can't win without a piece of the South.  Sure, Gore came within a few thousand votes in New Hampshire of doing it in 2000, but the math is too hard to ignore.  If Kerry can win one southern state, he will be president.  So, he should unleash Edwards in Tennessee and Arkansas (and W. Virginia which is not a Southern state, but which will be won over anyway) and take those states back from Bush.  With Edwards on the ticket, we need to brace ourselves for tort reform becoming a big part of this campaign.  Edwards is a trial lawyer, and has not been friendly to tort reform in the past.  Republicans have made this a strong piece of their "reform" package and have managed to sell an attempt to protect corporate pocketbooks as a democratic necessity to protect doctors.  Don't be fooled. Tort reform is not a benificial reform, will not reduce the number of lawsuits, and will only stop companies from being forced to pay enough for their mistakes that they stop making them.  I don't know what Kerry/Edwards will do when tort comes up -- but I'd love to see Edwards go for the jugular on this one.

      Urban finally posts some shit at  urlLink  The Drunk Monk.   It's about time.  I take offense to his little "dork" comments.  As someone who proudly wore a Dukakis/Bentsen '88 button in third grade, I will have you know that I do not intend ever to live in Washington, DC.  Unless Fagistan is admitted to the Union and I'm elected to the US Senate.  I was really in love with Dukakis, though.  I really thought that the fact that he won my elementary's school's little "poll" meant he'd take Bush in a landslide.  And no one was as drunk as Kitty Dukakis.  She would have been a fabulous, sort of drag-queen-looking First Lady.  Oh, the life not lived.  He also gives us some good architectural criticism.  My grandfather also served in the Pacific Theater, and I can tell you he'd hate this cocksucking memorial (his words, not mine.  Gramps was basically a character from  Deadwood .)  He is too dead to care anymore, but I know the truth.

      I feel like my blog is turning into a  urlLink  Godblog .  Still, I must share with you the best Focus on the Family radio commercial ever.  LITTLE BOY: Grandpa, I wish we could spend all summer together. GRANDPA: Me too, Timmy. LITTLE BOY: My new Daddy doesn't like you.  He says you talk about   God  too much! GRANDPA: Well do you like my stories? LITTLE BOY: Of course, Grandpa! GRANDPA: Good.  Well then let me tell you this one about a whale . . .   What is so perfect about this commercial?  Is it that they encourage grandparents to interfere in their grandchildrens'religious education?  Is it the clever way they manage to imply that the child's mother is a dirty whore who doesn't care about her son because she got divorced and then married a Devil Worshipper?  I cannot decide.  But after hearing this commercial, I now know that you can never talk about Good too much, that step-parents are always wrong, that divorce is evil and that Summer Vacations are best spent hearing Bible stories from Gramps.  Extremely educational.  Thank you, Jesus, Daddy and the Spook!

      While at the Exodus site, I decided to send in a prayer request for my friend "Ben."  [name "changed" to protect the cocksucking.]  Here is the text of my e-mail and the encouraging reply I received:  Hello, I am concerned for my friend Ben.  He has recently confessed to me that he has been engaged in various acts of sodomy for several years now and has probably swallowed as much as a gallon of semen in the past three weeks.  I am trying to show my support, and bring grace into his life, but it is very hard.  He says he "loves the taste" and won't give it up, not even for Christ.  I thought he was a Christian, but maybe he is just a Satanist.  Please pray for him and send me any advice you might have for me to continue Jesus's ministry on Earth. Thank you, Joshua  Dear Friend,  Thank you for entrusting your prayer request to us!  It is an honor and  privilege to have your confidence.  Rest assured we do not take this  responsibility lightly, and that your information is kept strictly  confidential.   Please understand that by the sheer volume of requests that are sent to  our office, our staff is not able to personally respond to every  request received.  But you are not alone!  The Exodus staff meets regularly  to pray, and we will be sure to lift your need to the Lord.   Personal connection and qualified ministry support is extremely  critical, whether you are struggling with issues of sexuality or are concerned  about someone who is.  With that in mind, Exodus member ministries  around North America stand ready to help you.  For more information on an  agency near you, please be sure to check out the “Find a Ministry” link  on the Exodus website:  www.exodus-international.org.  Standing with you in prayer, The Exodus Staff  I'm glad they're looking after you, "Ben."

      After an ill-advised bout of Delilah left me feeling like I'd just had bad sushi, I accidentally turned the radio dial to a Christian station, which was airing its show on parenting.  The guest was  urlLink  Focus on the Family's  "sexuality and gender issues analyst," Melissa Fryrear (a name so close to the title of an excellent hetero anal sex porno   Fry My Ass!  that it reminds me of Tracy Ullman's declaration that the name Latrine "sure beats Shit-House now don't it?" in   Robin Hood Men In Tights ).  You can read Melissa's courageous story of redemption  urlLink  here.   Luckily for Melissa, she found the Lord and realized that life spent in prayer was preferable to life spent chewing on a clit.  It was a long struggle, taking more than a year "wrestling with God," before she gave up on boxed lunch.  Now she works with  urlLink  Exodus Ministries , and youth pastors and parents, to help get young people to give up on same-sex attractions.  She seems very pleasant to talk to, unlike most bitter ex-pussylickers I know.  She didn't seem to miss it at all.  I mean, sure she insisted on a pretty lame conflation of "gender identity" and "sexuality," essentially chalking homosexuality up to an inability to be comfortable as a man or a woman.  But, in listening to her heart-warming story of defeating Satan's Cockscuking Minions and embracing the vagina-loving Lord, I was struck by how much I have in common with these people.  For instance, both myself and Ms. Fryrear agree that people are not "born gay," (though I think that biological factors probably have some influence.)  I'll even admit that therapy could turn people straight, at least some people who really wanted to be straight (but come on, who wants a train ticket to Lameheteroville anyway?).  And how do you really dispute her assertions that gays come from homes with a "breakdown" of traditional gender-roles?  I think it's more likely for a normal range of sexual behavior to emerge in gender-progressive households.  So I guess we agree.  [Full disclosure: my mother provided both the "nurturing" mother role and the "disciplinarian" father role in my family, while my father did the cooking and gardening.  So, that explains my proclivity for buttsex, buttplugs, buttstretching, buttlicking, buttfisting and buttbutter.]  I think being gay rocks hardcore, and she thinks its, you know, a mortal sin.  Whatever.  God doesn't exist, and if he did it would be a shame if he didn't want me to suck dicks.  Simple biology proves that my mouth was made for dicks.  If not, why would dicks look and taste so delicious?  And why would I have been born with a cleft-palate which is great for my "cum-out-the-nose trick?"  It is like those bugs that have proboscuses shaped for certain flowers.  Only your dick is shaped for my throat.  Coincidence?  No!  It is clearly the work of the Lord.  Also, why would turds look almost just like penises if penises weren't meant to go in assholes?  Surely God would not have created such a clue and not expected us to follow it to the buried prostate treasure.  Not to mention this interesting fact that Ms. Fryrear ignores, suggesting that she knows the Bible less than she claims.  We all know that Jesus was celibate, despite the fact that a whore by the name of Monica Bellucci wanted to have his abortion like nobody's business.  Yes, that's right.  Jesus would rather go to the Cross a sad, pathetic, horny virgin than touch the vagina of a beautiful Italian-Hebrew prostitute with great tits.  Also, his mother was a "Virgin."  Joseph seems to have been rather handsome, so why did she refuse him entrance to her love cave?  Could it be that she shuddered at the thought of his grody carpenter's tool hammering away at her high traffic, industrial strength carpet?  Yes.  And was it not Peter's fear of being outted that led him to deny Christ three times?  The apocryphal Gospel of Thomas even suggests that Christ visited India, where he undoubtedly read the Kama Sutra and learned many new butt tricks.  Christ also wore sandals.  The Biblical evidence for Christ's flaming homosexuality is so overwhelming that James Dobson himself could not deny it.  Indeed, I think Ms. Fryrear missed her last Bible-study class because she fell off the wagon, straight into a steamy pile of pussy.  For those of you still struggling with homosexuality, by all means, please visit the Exodus site and see for yourself the joys of heterosexuality.  For the rest of you, I leave you with Aunt Ida's wise words on the dsyfunction of the hetero: "The world of the heterosexual is a sick and boring life!"

      I know I said I was on vacation.  I lied.  The covered wagon ain't here yet and I have important breaking news.  As many of you already know (either by reading her yourself, or through  urlLink  Ben's  linkage) Wonkette is searching for a part-time internish-like "love slave."  Part of the application process, if it can be so dignified, is to write a haiku about Al Gore.  The President of Fagistan is   obsessed with haikus.   I find them fascinating, as they are invariably shitty and have no spectrum of quality.  All haikus are equally bad.  It means that any of us can be as good as the "great" ancient Zen poets of Japan, provided only that we can count syllables.  Like some people count floor tiles, or wash their hands a million times per day, so do I write haikus.  Constantly, in my head.  I have hundreds of these things filling journals and files on my computer.  So of course, in 2000, I wrote more than one   Goreku .  I sent them to Wonkette, of course, even though I'm not applying for the job (but man I'd die for the job.)  Here is a posting of hers from today, in which she calls me a pussy and urlLink  publishes my haiku:   Who knew the pent-up demand for poetry about Al Gore? We've got people submitting Gore-Kus who aren't even interested in becoming the Wonkette love slave. . . they just like writing haikus about Al Gore! What pussies! Betcha a lot of them are just doing it out of Nader guilt. Here are some of the ones that don't mention ass-fucking:   What is up with his hair? Please get a haircut Or I vote for Bush -- JG    That's right, bitches, my haiku about Al Gore's hairdo is on Wonkette.  Soon, all the world will be bowing down before my haiku writing genius.  And by the way: she published what was easily the dumbest of the haikus I submitted.  In the interest of fairness I'm posting all my Gorekus below, so that you can decided which is the best one.  Please vote via the comments section.  [For someone who loves assfucking, Wonkette sure seems unwilling to publish my assfucking haikus.  Stuck-up, prudey bitch.]  My heart aflutter Al Gore is masturbating Is this haiku wrong?  Which rich boy will win? The robot or the caveman? Which douchebag shall rule?  Tipper tapper too Convention makeouts are hot Slip her some more tongue  Al Gore Is Scary Why does he haunt my nightmares? Ax-murderer Gore  Al Gore is gay I had ass sex with him twice He begged me for more  What is up with his hair?  Please get a haircut Or I vote for Bush  Dildos vibrators buttplugs nipple clamps and more My ass is hungry  Okay, so the last one wasn't about Gore.  I just slipped that one in for me and la femme Wonk.

      Loyal Fagistanis, Hearken to my voice!  I am not drunk yet, but soon I will be, and then my wrath shall be terrible as I smite the land.  Wait, no, that's someone else.  Like the President of the United States and Andrew Sullivan, the President of Fagistan likes to vacation in August.  Unlike them, I am not well-enough paid to take an entire month off.  So, instead, I will just take the next five days off.  My father and brother are coming to Oregon as did the pioneers, in a covered wagon my father has fashioned atop his black pickup (vanity plates read, I shit you not: BLCKPWR).  We will camp, and crab and clam and kill a dozen or more hippies.  I will return Thursday morning.  So catch you then, like I'm catching syphillis now.

      Tony Kushner, in the run-up to the war in Iraq, wrote this truly hideous "scene" of  urlLink  Laura Bush at a "reading event" for dead Iraqi children.   Now he's published a  urlLink  follow-up  in which he is kind enough to allow a very fictional Laura Bush to respond.  At the Moveon.org benefit, Laura Bush was played by John Cameron Mitchell, the "angel" was played by Patricia Clarkson and Kristen Johnston narratted.  Kushner is a great playwright, so I can see how he could convince great performers to indulge his most infantile work to date, but it's still painful.  The follow-up scene is actually not that bad.  Although Kushner claims that "Clinton never attacked another country" (in this scene, Mitchell plays Kushner, Clarkson plays Laura and Johnston plays herself), one of the dead Iraqi angelbabies was killed by a bomb in 1999.  In order for this world to be coherent we must ignore essentially all of Clinton's foreign policy   and  pretend that Bush "stole" the election so hardcore it teleported him back in time two years.  The original piece is filled with grotesquery, of course.  There is talk about the low student-teacher ratio in Heaven.  When Laura asks how many children have died in Iraq, the estimate rises from 150,000 to 600,000 in two lines, while the angel announces that "no one is counting."  Good thing for Kushner.  Since no one's counting, why not claim eighteen million died?  Oh, and the dead children don't speak.  Their voices sound like birdsong.  Make me puke on my dick.  Bird-singing children?  A definite case for wholesale carpet bombing if you ask me.  Dostoyevsky is referred to as "A reactionary Christian mystic epileptic compulsive gambler anti-Semitic Russian nationalist genius genius  genius  named Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky!"  Which appears to be Kushner's attempt to dismiss Laura's real literary taste as simply reactionary (but then Kushner admits to likely Fyodor himself in the follow-up . . . at some point, keeping up with Kushner's evasions and doubletalk becomes pointless, so I'll probably stop soon.)  Although the whole thing displays the shittiest of anitwar sentiments (the most treacly, least realistic and most morally confused), Kushner does write Laura, in her "response" and in the final, long, agonizing bit of melodrama in the original, some fucking awesome dialogue.  Here are some bits:  LB: [Overlapping on "you snoop, etc."] But for people like you it's a precious badge of distinction notifying all other suit wearers, "Look at me, I have read enough to be muddleheaded enough not to do a frigging thing!" I mean, look at that gloomy old banana face you just nominated, and sorry to be name-calling but really, take a good look! Does anyone think he's likely to do anything other than marvel at the complexity of everything and hire people who are similarly awestruck and flabbergasted at the, at the whole magical mystery tour incomprehensibility of it all, and so you'll, you'll all get together in Washington like last time and you'll, you'll what, you'll   ban snowmobiles in Yellowstone Park  and then everyone in the Sierra Club'll take everyone in PETA out for a Sunday night pizza!  On thoughtful politicians:  [N]o you didn't attack another country, not like you meant it, you all just fire a missile here and a missile there and look like you are   thinking real hard  about the  meaning  of missiles  And in what might be the most disturbing sex scene ever (as Laura simultaneously fucks George, Satan and Dostoyevksy):   And Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky understood this, he wasn't snowy old high-toned Count Tolstoy, no, he's down there in the shit with you, froth on his lips and his thick tongue stiff, stiff and distended, dear Fyodor Mikhailovich, the smell of cigar smoke clinging to the coarse nubbly wool of his cheap black suit and his foul epileptic's breath, and sometimes, when, when I must suffer the touch of, of HIM. The Dread Spirit in his newest disguise. Sometimes when his hands are on me I say to my lonesome self, "Laura Welch, this is not The Dread Spirit who is touching you, it's just dear, dear Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky,"   and he puts his whiskery mouth close to my ear and he hisses, "Sinner!"  He knows, he's the only one who knows what that word means! SINNER!  I like children! I really, really do! 600,000?  Jesus Christ.  A year from now, in what pit of hell will I awake!?  I was a Democrat when I was a girl! This is what great literature can do! He weeps as he rattles me. I never shall be chaste except he ravish me. And I am rattled till my screws come loose, I am rattled like, like...the way, when I am in a mood, I attack and scour a sooty pot.   I'd love to have seen this, if only for JC Mitchell's rendering of this final passage.  Oh sure, it's way over-the-top, and almost fanatically hateful, but damn, is that a sweet monologue. Oh, and even better, MoveOn.org actually invited Laura herself to play the part.  Can you imagine?  That might be better than Mini KISS.

      Despite my brother's promotion of a Cruise-Watanabe ticket, Charles Taylor agrees with me that  urlLink  Tom Cruise fucking sucks.   This piece is actually pretty good, because Charles reinforces all my thoughts on the subject matter (except to say that   Eyes Wide Shut  is lousy.)  [I]n his climactic scene in "Magnolia," crying over his dying father, played by Jason Robards, I almost felt sorry for Cruise; there he was, shaking and crying and emoting, and Robards, playing comatose, completely outacted him. . . In the third decade of his film career, Cruise still radiates the luck of the cute boy in high school who has managed to hold on to his looks and who has yet to be tested in a way that would make him a believable adult.

      I know Michelle Malkin totally loves it.  I know Ann Coulter totally loves it.  But it's fucking dumb.  Especially when applied to potential "terrorists" on airline flights.  Steven Landsburg, of Slate's everyday Economics, proposes that we detain young Arab men, especially if they travel in groups, but  urlLink  pay them $100 dollars for their trouble.   Ticket prices would rise only slightly to offset the pay-out, detainees would have their humiliation and inconvenience assuaged with a crisp hundred bucks and stupid racist bitches like that one who was scared of Syrian musicians who prefer to eat their McDonald's in the shitcan would feel safe and could concentrate on more important issues, like how awesome it is to be white.  Now, I'd take a hundred bucks for being detained, but it wouldn't necessarily make me feel better.  Of course, they wouldn't detain me, even though I might very well fit the Timothy McVeigh profile, because I'm all Aryan and shit.  Landsburg says detaining Arabs makes more sense, as they are "statistically" more likely to be terrorists.  Even if this is true, and I have my doubts (remember that "terrorism" under government definition includes all those dreadlocked white kids who set bombs under tractors in the National Forests) it's not statistically significant.  How many young Arabs fly the friendly skies each year?  How many blow shit up?  Although the ratio between fliers/shit-blowers would be higher if you used young Arabs instead of Presbyterian grandmothers, it's still so small that it is more of an inconvenience to everyone on the flight (through delays) than it is worth detaining every Arab who wants to fly.  I mean, sure, if a particular passenger, or group of passengers, sticks out for some reason, then by all means, detain.  Even pay them if you must.  But the expense involved in detaining the large number of Arab American passengers on all domestic flights far outweighs the benefit of catching the almost-none of them who are terrorists.  And why should we assume the Al Qaida will continue to use Arabs anyway?  There are  white Muslims who sympathize with the cause of Al Qaida. White American Muslims no less.  All they have to do is put on a business suit and suddenly they are the epitome of the non-detained whiteboy.  And as the religious Right in America becomes more extremist in rhetoric and actions, we can all imagine a time when it might become necessary to detain every pimple-faced seventeen-year-old with a WWJD bracelet.  People still don't get it about terrorism.  The rhetoric of a "war" allows us to assume that we are fighting a discrete phenomenon.  It might not be a "country" (although fighting the war on something that isn't a country seems to take on the shape of wars against countries pretty often, don't it?) but it is a single, solid group of easily distinguished enemies.  They have a uniform, only they call it their "skin."  Therefore, fear the darkies, just like you've always done, and all will be well.  But terrorism is so amorphous, and the players so indistinguishable from non-players, that it's impossible to know who is even a   potential  terrorist.  As extremism on both sides of the spectrum grows in America, as more and more American youths are finding their way to Islam or not-so-fringe-anymore Right Wing Christianity, or militant Zionism, or Militant Environmentalism, we simply can't allow such a shit-poor dumb idea as "racial profiling" to lead to real terrorists slipping by while a Syrian band is left stewing in their shoe-less feet awaiting pronouncement that they are "safe."  I mean, I could understand of blind, dumb 1850s-style racism if it had some, you know, pragmatic   point .  Surprised as my readers will be, it runs out that once again   racism is retarded.   In fact, the only thing that seems to be true of nearly all terrorists is that they are ridiculously, ass-fuckingly hot.  That should be the detention criterion is there is one.  I will personally conduct the "interrogation" using nothing but my tongue.  No terrorist will slip through my clutches before I've uncovered his "dirty bomb."  I'll totally give them a hundred bucks too.

      Ann Coulter on the  urlLink vetting of candidates:   Given the Democratic scandals, their presidential candidates might consider the following litmus-test question before hiring their campaign staff: "Have you ever put anything into your shorts, or taken anything out of your shorts, that could negatively affect this campaign?"   In other Ann C news, Tim tells us that Ann is so  urlLink  not as crazy as Michelle Malkin.   Of course, I agree.  Ann loves McCarthy, which is only half-crazy.  Supporting internment camps is a whole new ballgame.  But, if part of what makes Ann so undeniably sexy to liberal fags is that she is crazy then I guess Michelle might be sexier?

      A coworker relayed this story told to him by a friend in L.A.  Friend of Co-worker (here on out referred to as FC) was at a party at LL's house.  FC had to take a piss and was roaming the apparently pretty large digs in search of the pisser.  He opened up various doors and went into one of the several bedrooms.  In this bedroom was a framed photograph.  Of Lindsay and Aaron Carter.    Fucking.

      Luke apologizes for saying mean things about the Senator, but challenges my invocation of our family's history of support for Democrats:  I am sorry I called Kerry a douchebag.  He is actually a brave and courgeous baby killer douchebag DELUXE.  at least bush  doesnt look like frankensteins illegitimate bro.  There are no more true patriots in this country.  If there were, they would revolt.  and whatever about our long proud line of democrats.  our fam was nothin but a bunch of poo butts who could never get their acts together.  If they did, they would have been republicans and you would be all pro bush.  Fact is, all the parties suck a mean dick. I want Kevin Costner for pres. or better yet, Tom Cruise but he would have to wear his samurai armor all the time.  That would be tight.

      I haven't written about the Kerry Bounce Controversy yet, because I was hoping it would just go away.  I won't pretend I'm not disappointed.  One of the major reasons I dismissed Kerry's idea of delaying his nomination was because the delay would kill his bounce.  So, if he didn't get one, then the early convention just handed the Republicans a serious funding advantage for no reason.  Still, I'm hardly despondent.  I knew that pollsters were predicting little to no bounce, but I thought they had to be wrong, and privately predicted a 5-10 point surge in Kerry's numbers.  At best, we're seeing a narrow surge.  It's not what I'd hoped for.  In recent polls Kerry has edged ahead of Bush by six points in Ohio.  Six points is a real lead, if a narrow one, and shows that as the campaign hits its stride the undecided are moving Kerry's way.  I'm particularly optimistic about this happening in Ohio.  I am still convinced that Kerry will take every Gore state and add New Hampshire.  I haven't done the math in a while (I can't find my enormous map of the United States . . . and need to get another one before November) but I'm pretty sure that the Gore states lost electoral votes, meaning that taking New Hampshire won't win it for Kerry.  Ohio, one of the Big Ten states that can win you the election all by themselves, can.  I don't see a way that Kerry can win Ohio and lose the election.  If Kerry can increase his Ohio lead significantly in the next few weeks before the RNC then we can forget Florida altogether.  In 2000 I went out on a limb and named two states as the deciding factors in the election. The states were Michigan and Florida.  I thought that if Gore won either state he'd be President.  As it turns out, he needed them both.  This year, Florida is still in play, and has more electors than Ohio, so we can't write it off.  But Ohio may be the clincher, especially if Kerry manages to move Pennsylvania and Oregon firmly into his column by October (which I think he will.)  If the Rust Belt becomes solidly Democratic this year, then we don't need to worry so much about taking back West Virginia or winning a state south of the Mason-Dixon.  And the numbers favor him.  The Rust Belt States (particularly Pennsylvania and Ohio, but also Michigan) have suffered worse economically then the rest of the country, and there simply isn't enough time in the next three months for the economy to pick up enough to effect Bush positively.  Both Pennsylvania and Michigan elected Democratic governors in 2002, taking the statehouses back from Republicans in a midterm that was overwhelmingly good for Bush.  Pennyslvania's (truly great) Republican Senator, Arlen Specter, is in a fight for his political life.  Ohio is moving to Kerry.  I am more confident now than I have been any time in the last two years that we will beat President Bush in November.  Less then 20% of voters are undecided (as compared to as many as 70% in 1992), which means that nearly everyone has made up their mind. With that being said, we shouldn't be surprised that little bounce has happened.  People are paying attention and are, far more often than not, dedicated to a candidate.  We may be in trouble if Bush sees a big bounce in September, but I don't think he'll get one.  Kerry isn't so weak a candidate that the law of bounces wouldn't apply to him but would apply to his opponent.  Kerry is going to win in November, and, I think, we have a strong chance of seizing the Senate.  This should be another post, but here's how I break it down.  Democrats will beat the incumbent in Alaska, win in Illinois and Colorado and possibly Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.  Democrats will hold their incumbent seats in South Carolina, North Carolina, Louisiana and Florida, giving up only Georgia to the Republicans.  No Democratic incumbent will lose.  That's a plus two at least, and maybe a plus four.  The Republican Revolution of 1994 is crumbling.  And how sweet it is.

      Last Saturday, Portland hot-spot Dante's had what may have been   THE GREATEST CONCERT EVER!   Here is the line-up:  1.  urlLink  We Got The Meat. : Portland's Only All-Male Go-Go's Cover Band  2.  urlLink  The Misfats : The Fattest Misfits Tribute Band Ever!  And the only one to change all the lyrics to be about the fat lifestyle.  You want "I turned into a Martian?" we give you "I turned into a Lardass."  3. And, the headliners,  urlLink  Mini KISS : an all-midget KISS cover band.  Exploitation has never been so totally   AWESOME .  I love midgets.  I love fatties.  I love men.  What could possibly rock my world harder?    I don't know!   I have to admit that I don't care for "cover bands."  Not even good ones.  Not even stunt ones.  After living with the drummer in an all-girl AC/DC cover band ( urlLink  Hell's Belles ) my dislike for cover bands reached a fever pitch.  But come on . . . We Got the Meat?  The Misfats?  Mother double fucking   Mini Kiss?   I can't believe I missed it.  When I get my time machine I might have to skip that   Bukowski abortion  in favor of going back of July 31 for this show.  And damn, I was really looking forward to that abortion.

       1. Lori Hacking:  This story is   totally better than Laci/Scott.   Oh sure, the Hackings are kind of ugly.  But this is pure   Law and Order , folks.  Mr. Hacking tells his whole family he is going to medical school, only to have it revealed that he never graduated from undergrad and has not applied to medical school.  He calls family and friends to say his wife is missing, then goes and buys a bed before calling the cops.  They find a clump of brown hair in the trash bin at the bed store.  He tells his family that she was pregnant, but she never told anyone else about this.  His and her parents hold a press conference to call off the search, but the police can't get in contact with them regarding what new information Mr. Hacking gave them, as they won't return phone calls.  Murderous Mormons have never been so exciting.   2.  urlLink  Wonkette  returns:  After a whole week of some fag named "BoiFromTroi" writing her blog, it's good to have Wonkette back.  She's got a photo of Bush being more limp-wristed than me and this assessment of her drunken DNC experience: "Summing up the convention in any narrative form would require remembering more of it than we actually do."   3. Lost Opportunities:  The 9/11 Commission report identifies ten "missed opportunities" to stop Al Qaeda (four in Clinton's eight years, six in Bush's eight months).   urlLink  Time carries this quote from Bill Clinton : "it would scare the shit out of al-Qaeda if suddenly a bunch of black ninjas rappelled out of helicopters into the middle of their camp."  I totally agree.  But the United States has been pretty shy to use its elite core of black ninjas in the twenty-five years since Henry Kissinger began the secret program.  Speaking of "black ninjas", wasn't  urlLink    American Ninja   the greatest film of all time?   4. More of the same:  I am still totally obsessed with the Decemberists, and totally bought all their other stuff this weekend.  I love them so much it hurts.  It may even be giving me cancer.  I don't know.  What I do know is "Red Right Ankle" is maybe the most beautiful little love song ever and "Los Angeles, I'm Yours" almost makes me wish I lived there.  Now I just have to find non-creepy ways to meet Colin Meloy again.   5.  urlLink  Emerson College Students For Bush :  There are nine of them.  Who wants to bet they are all musical theater majors?

      Article III Groupie's got  urlLink  another list of judicial improprieties by state court judges.   My faves: --"judge commented on breasts of prosecuting attorney and told another prosecutor that he wanted to 'jump your bones'"'  --judge said to the mother of an unwed young prengant woman, "I suppose it was too much to ask that your daughter keep her pants on and not behave like a slut"  -judge consistently made improper sexual suggestions to female court staff, once commenting that he was tempted to buy a pair of "small red panties" for a clerk, and on another occasion offering to wash the blue jeans of a female staff person if she would "take them off right [then]."

      I have long thought that if any single product could lead to large-scale global calamity and terrorism, it would have to be cigarettes.  Not oil, not pharmaceuticals, not human fetus handbags.  Cigarettes.  You know, sweet, sweet tobacco, that fills my lungs with smoky joy.  This is the stuff terrorist rage is made of.  Luckily, Ben has  urlLink  ferreted out an alternate-history novel  that is premised on exactly this.  The weirdest part about this novel is that it is both kinds of alternate history novel at once.  Some alternate histories just presume that things went differently (Lee winning at Gettsyburg, allowing Britain and France to enter the Civil War on the side of the CSA) and some presume that people will time-travel to change things (Afrikaaner neo-Nazis travelling back in time to give the Confederate Army AK-47s.)  This does both.  It reminds me of Orson Scott Card's fantastic   Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus  in which we discover that in the "real" history, the native peoples of the Americas developed industry and conquered Europe and nearly destroyed the world, so the wise people of the future went back and gave Columbus a vision of Christ (which Columbus claimed to have had) telling him to go West.  But then, of course, the Europeans also fucked it all up, so what to do now?  Interesting stuff. Except that Bill Clinton isn't that interesting.  And, to clear things up, I don't think the "James" character is actually Carville, but is a codenamed NSC agent named AFTER Carville (there is also a "George.")  This seems like such a bad idea it might actually be good. This good totally be the   Showgirls  of alternate history novels.

      One of the biggest gossip pieces in the political air these days is about Jerry Springer, Ohio delegate to the DNC, potential gubernatorial candidate, talk-show host, and city-councilman who resigned after paying for a hooker with a personal check.  Springer is the kind of mainstream politician even John Waters could love.  Every pundit wants to talk about Springer, because it's the kind of political bookmaking that has appeal outside the Dorkway.  Of course, Springer gossip is hardly new.  Remember back when he was going to challenge Senator George Voinovich?  Well, that fell through. Can't imagine why.  Back in those Springer v. Voinovich days, I put a lot of thought into whether or not such a bid would be a good idea.  I ruled against it, because Springer negatives were too high, Voinovich was immune from anti-Bush sentiment among moderates and independents because he was the Senator who single-handedly forced the President to reduce his tax cut proposal, and Springer clearly hadn't come up with a way to blunt criticism of his talk show.  The first rule of politics is name recognition is everything.  Springer has near-100% recognition (through-out his Vice Presidency, Al Gore's recog rating were in the low 90s).  This is a serious advantage that comes close to overcoming the negative ratings altogether.  But with negative ratings at 75%, well, that might be a bit much.   urlLink  Salon's got an interview with Jerry.   The interview didn't make me think much more of him.  He seems earnest, has a keen sense of political realities, and is willing to push a populist and left-of-center agenda.  But he still seemed incapable of dealing with his show.  He has to a find a way of turning the show to his advantage, or at least turning the criticism away.  As  urlLink  Tim Noah has said  at Slate, if Kerry doesn't win Ohio, there is almost no way that Springer can be denied the nomination.  The frenzy for any candidate with the twin advantages of huge personal wealth and high name recognition won't be overcome in the primary.  But Noah also finally got the answer I was looking for.  When asked about his show, Springer says it "didn't shut down one factory ... it's absolutely irrelevant to people's lives."  In a state where even President Bush admits the economy is not picking up [Bush's message in Ohio seems to be "So, yeah, the economy here is still shitty.  But it will get better.  I won't do anything to make it better.  Just have faith in tax cuts.  Tax cuts are totally the new Jesus!"], this message may be what Springer needs.  It marries a populist message to a dismissal of his critics.  Whether or not this formulation will work, it gives me an idea that maybe Springer has the ability to craft a political narrative that   will  work.  The problem with his campaign to me now is less the candidate than the platform.  Should the economy turn up in the first two years of a Kerry administration, that can help create coattails for Congressmen, but will have limited impact on gubernatorial elections.  The sitting Republican administration will get the credit, and Springer's message won't have any power anymore.  Ohio, the birthplace of at least eight Republican presidents (roughly twenty percent of all presidents) will almost certainly turn back to its conservative roots unless the economy stays bad.  Springer should pray for a depression.

      The 1962   Manchurian Candidate  is among the most important films in history.  I don't mean film history.  I mean American history.  Almost no other film has had so pervasive an effect on our political culture.  Paranoia itself is fairly common in American political discourse, but this film pushed it into new and dizzying heights following the assassination of JFK.  There is not one extant conspiracy theory about that assassination that doesn't rely on the absurd plot devices of   The Manchurian Candidate.   Not only did it lay the framework for countless riffs and digressions within the film world (culminating in the schizophrenic diarrhea of Stone's execrable   JFK ), but without it, it's hard to imagine that the average conspiracy theorist would have been able to make much out of the events in Dallas.  In addition,   The Manchurian Candidate  gave us Mrs. Iselin, the standard by which all female politicians are now judged.  Although she was not an elected official, the narratives constructed around powerful women like Hillary Clinton are lifted almost whole from the film.  How can a new version of the film possibly live up to that?  Well, it doesn't.  But that's not very important.  Jonathan Demme's film resembles Frankenheimer's only in terms of the big set pieces (Brainwashing, Presidential Assassinations, Mama's Boys and Boys' Mamas) that comparisons aren't worth a whole lot.  There are some awkward problems.  I'm still not convinced I care for Manchurian Global (which reminds me of the Denmark Corporation in   Hamlet ), and see no need to "explain" what is Manchurian about it.  The term has a meaning of it's own, the "sleeper candidate," that is independent of China.  There is perhaps too much emphasis on the actual process of brainwashing.  I don't understand why they avoid naming the Arthur/Shaw ticket as a Democratic ticket, since they make no attempt to actually hide it.  Perhaps it's to leave us with the impression that Senator Shaw is  right wing Republican, and not a leftover from the Right Wing Democratic Party of the state she represents. The film lacks as much power as the original in part because the "evil" force is a corporation, which just isn't as scary.  It's hard to imagine why a corporation would devote so much effort to getting a brainwashed president, unless they were also going to brainwash a majority of Congress and the leaders of every other major, and most minor, nations.  The first half of the movie is poorly paced.  But then things pick up, and the technical weight of the film, combined with the universally excellent performances, push the film toward mastery.  The paranoid vision Demme gives us is powerful and hypnotic.  Shot at nauseating angles, often in tight close-ups that cut away the edges of the characters' faces, bodies are torn apart, leaving only the sickly-sweet tremor of a mind about to collapse.  The camera moves against the grain of the action, drifting almost without volition from frame to frame, catching pieces of soldiers' bodies as it roves.  This picture's more graceful, elegant camerawork is far more paranoid and haunting than any amount of grotesque Oliver Stone editing can hope to be.  Frankenheimer's movie is far more claustrophobic; Demme gives us a sense of expansiveness that we can never quite grasp, the world (and truth) are just out of sight.  Denzel Washington is a better actor than Frank Sinatra.  I can't imagine that anyone would disagree, but I'm sure someone will.  Washington's character is far more believable than Sinatra's was (he is the weak link in the original, because he is so unbelievable that even with an utterly unbelievable plot he sticks out as particularly tone deaf -- he doesn't have the kind of brash melodramatic flair of the other principals), and fits into the furiously intricate maneuvering nicely.  He is paranoid, but not Mel-Gibson-Conspiracy-Theory paranoid, and his handsomeness is virtually erased under the pounding of memory, duty and fear.  Liev Schreiber strikes me as an actor with a really great name.  Beyond that, I've generally not been impassioned about him.  But here there is something vulnerable and sinister that is compelling.  His smile at the victory party is chilling with its depravity and courage.  Kimberly Elise stalks through her role with a kind of sexy ferocity that would make Janet Leigh proud.  The accessory pols (Governor Arthur and Senator Voight) fit their parts perfectly because, well, they look just like the kind of grey-haired cheesy douchebags who win party nominations these days.  But, particularly in the early scenes, this film is Meryl Streep's.  She pulls herself far back from Lansbury's tour-de-force to craft the very modern image of political ambition.  Stephanie Zacharek, at Salon, says the film has no humor and that Streep is terrible in dramatic roles.  Both are untrue, but that's another discussion.  Streep is wildly funny in this movie.  Her lines are so heavy with irony that even the most serious of them bring a smile.  She is at her best in comedic and nasty roles; when both are present, as here and in   Adaptation , she becomes exactly what everyone says she is: the greatest actress of her generation.  Many Streep critics say she is too calculated, but I love the calculation.  Streep is an actress, and we never forget it, and so she brings to the role layers that more "realistic" actors could never dig up.  And though this style can be awkward in a movie like, say,   Music of the Heart , too criticize it in   The Manchurian Candidate  is borderline idiotic.  Streep sounds so much like any right wing politician that we can easily forget she isn't one.  When she gives short, vicious speeches with soaring rhetoric she is simply reading from her Talking Points. Think, in particular, of the scene where she convinces the party leadership to accept her son as vice presidential nominee.  It's brilliant stuff, and Streep never lets go for one instant.  I could tell which members of the audience had not seen the original (most of them, obviously) because when Meryl barks out "Sergeant Shaw!" the theater was filled with a startled gasp.  It is a moment of unbridled viciousness as the dragon lady sees her plans obliterated and reaches for the only weapon she has left.  Oh, sure, this is not Angela Lansbury's evil perfection, but it is a remarkable performance that more than any other in the picture frees itself from the original and becomes wholly Streep's own.  Between Streep, Washington, Schreiber, Elise, Jeffrey Wright and Demme's feverishly precise direction,   The Manchurian Candidate  is a remarkable achievement.  Perhaps as much because it manages to work when it simply should not have than anything else.
