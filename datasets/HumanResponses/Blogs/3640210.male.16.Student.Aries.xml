      music, everywhere, but not a tune to listen to would be my annoying adaptation for the day.  Things feel very strange, complicated, and all too twisted which is probably a necessary  component of being human, but is still bothersome due to the complexity and murkiness present in my feelings.  Part of me is happy and excited because on saturday morning my friends and I get to leave home behind and venture to Ben's cottage outside Toronto for simply having a great time and reliving some of the *good* parts of the  urlLink choir tour (not including the dying of hair) and also living a whole new, fun experience.  Another part is more somber, contemplative, and slightly darker.  The only things I can attribute this to is boredom, loneliness, and restlessness (without which I would be sleeping with a relatively calm and peaceful mind rather than relating my uneasy, disconnected thoughts by writing a blog entry, but I digress, badly).                 Getting back on topic...  Music is how I usually get by and find a slightly purer clarity in my thoughts.  I don't necessarily like the terminology of "expressing myself" with music because I generally find that listening to music and/or lyrics generally helps to facilatate feelings, emotions, and thoughts that are otherwise difficult to find within myself and experience fully left to my own devices (though writing can do wonders).  Maybe "Musical Facilitation of Mental Such and Such" is the term I'm looking for as "Expression" doesn't seem to conotate understanding as much as it does communication (but then again, MFMSS may just conotate babbling).  The reason I bring all this up is that I'm having a hard time finding the right music to listen to.  It's not that I don't have enough music (though you can never have enough) to listen to, it's just that I can't find the music that fits my mood due to the somewhat contradictory parts of my emotional state outlined above.  I have a library of thirteen hundred fourty seven songs but I'm having trouble coming up with a playlist or even some individual songs that work with my mood.  So it's frustrating (though not greatly) and places me in an awkward position of just biding my time, trying to figure myself out a bit more while I wait for inspiration to float through the air and glide into my ears... or smack me in the face, that works too.

       urlLink Rock Kills Kid   nota bene: legal download   This is just a new band I just found out about which, if I don't say so myself, is quite good (or maybe I don't have any taste, you can judge). They have a pop punk sound, catchy songs, fairly straight forward lyrics, and seem to be pretty good overall even though they don't have a terribly unique sound. These downloads are from their first EP (that I may actually buy) which apparently has the same quality of work throughout. I particuraly like ' urlLink Dream ' which I've found I can relate to quite well while getting sucked in by the druming and overall energy of the song... Hope you enjoy listening.

          It's raining, I feel icky for some reason, and now I've got to go take a french placement test for summer courses.  On the other hand French is going to be a great diversion and I'm going north on saturday (with Ian, Si, Seth, Bruce, and ofcourse one of our gracious hosts, Ross).     Last night I went to a show at Nevin's which was really loud but highly enjoayable (even though I kept away from the mosh pit with my tevas on).  The music was somewhat better than I expected and things were generally peachy ignoring my ickiness and leaving early.  The most interesting thing with going to concerts for me is that I'm always struck with sudden and highly random philisophical thought, unless I'm about to get knocked flat on my bum.  Last night that though came in the form of a question:  How and why are mosh pits different from your average angry mob?  Mosh pits themselves are a lot like mobs, a big (or slightly less big) group of people who have come together in a common idea, get the crap beat out of you in good fun.  Most mobs start out peacefully then become raging and violent, mosh pits are simply violent (in the best possible conception, but still violent).  In mosh pits there always seems to be a communal spirit that dictates goodwill, if somone falls, pick them up.  I'll keep thinking about it when I'm feeling a bit clearer (and maybe write followup), but I just think it's interesting to compare the two. [/babble] have a nice day.

      with very corny subject titles.   Time to see what magic can be worked on this template... I might actually start writing entries later, including a better intorduction for passers-by.
