      STILL haven't heard about the apartment.  Started work yesterday.  I will be more than glad when all this driving is over.  I haven't seen Colette but for 5 minutes in the last 4 days and it SUCKS.  This week is going to be crazy hectic.  I need to move all my shit by Friday, and I dont have a place to move it to yet!  Typical me.  It'll sort itself out.  Always does.  Started a project i have put off for quite some time last night to make myself feel better.  More on that later.  Ask yourself "what have i always wanted to do and never done?"  and then set it in motion.  Does your soul good. I saw a shirt on jinxhackwear.com that sais "It is dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue."  Must... not... spend... money...

      Something I came across by Aram Saroyan: Speaking of moments in which one perceives that one is part of some larger whole; "Years later I came across a line in Krishnamurti that seemed to refer to this experience: 'Between apprehending and naming, is experiencing.'  If I understand correctly, Krishnamurti says here that in the interval between seeing something and putting a word to it inheres the true experience of what it is, or perhaps more accurately of  what is ." I spent all day yesterday with Colette, and it was far too short.  While I am around her, I feel like i am constantly in that moment between apprehending and naming.  In that in between second where life is.  On the shore.  In the half light.  At dawn.  At dusk.  In the gaps that let you peak through the surface of things to see the larger side.  I have never been with someone and it felt this... calm.  This peaceful.  Nothing to change.  Nothing to fear or hope for.  No exception or qualms.  Just being.  I have never felt this naturally in sync with another persons rhythm.  She ROCKS!  I mean like double devil horn Ronnie James Dio Rocks!  :-D  We spent the whole day running around town talking about books, or movies, or music, or whatever.  Light exchanges of ideas and deep feelings about what it means to  really  look at something - and in the same night plop down and play the ORIGINAL Contra on her ORIGINAL NES system!  Ooooooh man!  I'm hooked.  Its like someone created a clone of exactly what i would look for.      I had said that moving back to New Orleans was going to be a new start for me.  I think i was more correct than i realized.  I have never felt this clean or ready.  The days after today will be something other than those that came before.  A new phase.  A different movement in the song.  I am eager to hear what it sounds like.  I may have found a box for Nobi and I.  I'll find out for sure on Monday.  It's right next to the park!  I hope I get it... fingers crossed.

      Two things; 1.  Today NASA launched the "Gravity Probe B" satellite.  This probe is designed to prove elements of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity; specifically, it is designed to measure the distortion of the fabric of space-time caused by large celestial bodies.  HOW FUCKING COOL IS THAT?  The general theory in a nut shell is that space and time curve and bend around bodies like stars and planets.  Like what happens to a trampoline when you stand in the middle of it.  Furthermore the rotation of these large objects drag space and time with it.  Like a wake.  This probe is designed to measure both of these phenomenon.  Is this an episode of Star Trek?  WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD OF THIS BEFORE?  I mean we are measuring the effect gravity has on the fucking fabric of space time? WOW!  I'm serious too!  Check this shit out on  urlLink yahoo news  Number 2.  Read a quote of William James this morning in a journal.  Paraphrasing;  "Truth is an event.  The veracity of which can only be proven through experience."  That's fascinating in its implications.  Truth is not a quality - not an adjective.  An event.  A happening.  A thing.  I'm not saying i agree with it - but its an interesting theory to start on.  James' weaknesses are easy enough to find, but he does have some good stuff.  I dig his stream of consciousness stuff.  Kind of like Heraclites on speed.  You can't step into the same river twice and all that jazz. OK.  Having fulfilled my quota of geekness - back to my mild mannered alter ego.

      There is a famous zen parable that goes something like this; A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor's cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. "It's overfull! No more will go in!" the professor blurted. "You are like this cup," the master replied, "How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup." I am continually reminded how true this is.  If you keep your cup empty - if you can release all preconceived notions, desires, fears, etc - then there are always new things to learn and experience.  New ways in which to grow as a person.  Lately i am reminded that life can always surprise you.  No matter what you have seen or done, no matter where you are or have been. I am moving to New Orleans this week; next week at the latest.  I feel in every facet of my being that this transition is something more than just a transition.  It is the beginning of a whole new movement in my life.  It feels good.  I feel like i have made peace with everything that has come before in my life.  This decision is one that is made with no attatchments to what came before and no reservations.  It feels good.  Every thing in me tells me this is good and right and pure.  As i type this, I am getting ready to go find a new box for me and Nobi in NO. Life has thrown me another surprise as well.  One for which i do not think i can find the words.  I gave up looking for someone a long time ago.  I have been in relationships ect after i gave up - but at heart i was a tourist.  Just passing through.  This was fine with me.  I accepted it.  Made my peace.  I have found someone who makes me believe again that maybe the passion that makes life  life  may just be something that can be shared after all.  Full Circle.  As I said - i do not have the words...  Some of the things i feel seem familiar - like something remembered from childhood... but in all honesty, i have no precedent for this.  Nothing to which to refer.  Nothing to which i can compare such openness.  No need.  No rush.  Nothing assumed - just a soul laid bare.  Completely open.  Me.  Truly me.  No pretensions or games.  Last night she said "You feel different under the eyes of someone who really  sees  you."  I still feel as though i am wondering about in some amount of disbelief.  Is this really happening?   I guess you can always empty your cup more.  To say anything more would be to debase the feeling of the thing; so i will leave it for now.

      I feel much better now.  Not so overwhelmed.  Calmed.  Kung Fu has always been a doorway of sorts for me.  In the middle of training today - i realized that i had come to a very familiar place.  It happens when i push myself very hard or become totally absorbed in the motions of the techniques...  The familiar pain and exhileration of going to your physical limit...  there comes a time in these moments when my concentration is so total and focussed that it borders on emptiness.  Nothing can touch me there.  I am surrounded by a quiet loudness; a moving stillness.  These moments i have come to treasure.  In those times i come closer than any other to touching the core of what i am.  I believe this must be the same sensation a musician feels when they are truly one with what they are playing.  Or a painter, or whatever.  Whatever passion brings you to the brink of your realization and lets you dangle over the edge, looking at the profound nothingness beyond.   I began to find this place in myself years ago when i began my training.  I realized again today that this place will always be there.  With everything changing so quickly around me lately, I needed to touch that constant - that core of myself.  I feel good now.  Stilled.  Whatever will come will come.  I accept it with no expectation.  In the end, I can only be what i am and enjoy this unlooked for joy - whatever form it takes.

      I feel a bit overwhelmed.  Not wholly in a bad way... yet i cannot help but to feel the need for some self preservation...  to deny this would only be lying to myself.  I have never been able to do that, even when i probably should.  So i will see this play out.  If this is so, then i know i should just sit back and enjoy the unfolding; yet i fear to let myself completely go yet.  There has to be some path between being completely enveloped in this feeling; being completely swept under this delicious current -  and holding everything back; trying to stop a flood because i fear this will only be an echo of the past - a repeat performance.  Me high and dry.  There has to be a medium.  If only i can quiet myself long enough to find it. I miss her.  Can't focus or think.  Her eyes.  Her smell.  What an oddly complete mix of complete joy, anxiousness, and fear.  Patience is what i need.  To calm myself - relax.  Let things happen at their own pace.  No rush.  Chill out.  Fuck, Sunday will be long in coming.

      O.K., so the low today is supposed to be around 40.  The fuck?  I got up and ran a couple miles this morning just because, and the wind was so cold...  Kenobi is the exercise Nazi.  I used to take him running with me when he was a pup, and i think i may have scarred him for life.  He loves to go for walks (insists on carrying his leash himself) but if i start running, he'll get about three steps and then just sits the fuck down.  He weighs just under 120 pounds now, so its not good for your shoulder when he quits.  He just flat refuses to move.  If you try and get him to stand up, he lays down and rolls over on his back.  This can be a bit embarrassing - people driving by and me trying to drag a 120 pound "Rotweiler" who is laying on his back with his feet in the air.  "What is that guy doing to that poor dog?  Someone call the SPCA!"   So yeah - he usually wins that argument.  I guess you have to be smarter than your pet to outwit them. HA!  My Dad is the greatest!  He is somewhere in the Mediterranean right now - Diego Garcia i think, but he sends me these jokes every week that are waaaaay too stereotypically Irish.  I think that's why he likes them (like anyone actually says Top o' the morning to you!?  Except the Lucky Charms guy?)  This was in my email this morning;   Mrs. Donovan was walking down O'Connell Street in Dublin when she met up with Father Rafferty. The Father said, "Top o' the mornin' to ye!  Aren't ye Mrs. Donovan and didn't I marry ye and yer husband 2 years ago? " She replied, "Aye, that ye did, Father." The Father asked, "And be there any wee ones yet?" She replied, "No, not yet, Father." The Father said, "Well now, I'm going to Rome next week and I'll  light a candle for ye and yer husband." She replied, "Oh, thank ye, Father." They parted ways. Some years later they met again. The Father asked, "Well  now, Mrs. Donovan, how are ye these days?"  She replied, "Oh, very well, Father!" The Father asked, "And tell me, have ye any wee ones yet?"  She replied, "Oh yes, Father! Three sets of twins and 4 singles, 10 in all!" The Father said, "That's wonderful! How is yer loving husband doing?" She replied, "E's gone to Rome to blow out yer fookin' candle."  Ugh.

      I still feel i am at a loss for words.  I am constantly amazed at life.  Today however, after reflecting on everything that's happened lately, I have been experiencing an odd sense of unity.  Everything seems so connected to me right now.  Moving again, this refocusing on impermanence, my past relationships (and especially thoughts of Aimee), even the music i have been turned on to lately and the weather with the feeling of this being the truest Spring i have experienced - more than anything this overwhelming sense of connection i have found... all of these things seem to be connecting in a way far too sublime for me to grasp.  All of these disparate elements unified into a single burning flame.  I am but the moth - unable to turn away.  I would not if i could.  Whatever is happening, i find it utterly beautiful.  I think i saw her smile every time i blinked today.  I feel unrushed.  Some of it seems so surreal.  Picture someone coming to you, out of nowhere, handing you a cd and saying "Hi.  This is what your soul sounds like right now."  I feel myself opening up like i have not in years.  Its a little frightening, but it feels so good.  New growth.  Desire unhurried.   Ha!  It occurs to me that what we today celebrate as Easter was originally the festival of Spring.  Celebrating the end of winter and the beginning of new growth.  We even retain some of the original symbols.  Rabbits and eggs and all. Isn't that ironic?  Don't ya think?

      Wow.  What a day.  Driving down the interstate tonight, listening to Lisa Gerard (thanks Colette) I was awed when i came over a hill and saw just above the horizon a red moon.  Not yellow, not Pinkish, fucking RED.  Now, scientifically, I know why this happens.  When the Moon is in the Earth's shadow, there is some sunlight that still passes through our atmosphere at an angle. White light from the sun is composed of all the colors of the rainbow, but our atmosphere aint exactly equal opportunity.  It treats colors differently. Blue-colored light is scattered in all directions by particles that make up the atmosphere. That, Virginia, is why the sky is blue. Red-colored light, however, has much longer waves, and is scattered very little. But it is refracted toward the Moon. This Red light hits the Moon and is reflected back toward Earth, so that we see the Moon glowing red.  It only happens at the right alignment of Sun earth and moon, when the Moon is really low in the sky.  Usually it is accompanied by an eclipse.  Cerebrally i know this.  But it does not do justice or capture the awe of the vision.  I think no matter how far science progresses, things like this will always seem more portentous than that.  They should.  For my part, I will take it as a sign. Today was... truly... I try not to make generalities about life.  I think life is far too maleable and ever changing to capture an aspect of its essence in any statement, let alone a general one.  However, there are a few generalities i cling to, for they still ring true.   In life, we tend to repeat those lessons that we do not learn the first time.

      It is good to be reminded what a positive thing Kung Fu can be.  Regardless of the fact that most martial artists are arrogant pricks.  I love martial arts, but hate most martial artists.  These yahoos who spend a couple years in a TaeKwonDo school, pay money for a worthless piece of cloth to tie around their waste and act like Van Damm.  It makes me sick.  True martial arts should make you the most humble of people, because it leads you to realize how little you really know - how vast the scope of human endeavor is.  You don't study Kung Fu to learn how to fight, you study it to learn how not to have to fight.  I mean, if you know in your heart that you can beat some poor bastard senseless, then what is the point?  What will you learn from the confrontation?  Nothing.  You will only be stroking your own ego.  True martial arts aims at destroying that ego.  There are of course times one may have to defend him or herself, but the ultimate goal of Kung Fu is to defeat the only opponent that will ever matter: oneself.  Your own fears.  Your own ignorance.  Your own pettiness. I move in a month.  Maybe less.  I am more than ready for the move, but I will miss some of my students.  One of my students name is Omar.  Omar isn't very coordinated.  In fact he's very clumsy.  Omar speaks English with a slight accent and he's very self conscious about it.  Omar stutters.  We do have several truly gifted students at the school.  Really top notch.  Some have enough natural ability to compete professionally on any Martial arts circuit on the world and do fine.  But when I move, I think it is going to be the Omars that I miss.   Omar almost never does a technique correctly, but he ALWAYS tries his absolute hardest.  Whether you ask him to do it 10 times or 1000 times, he'll do it with his whole heart.  When he does get something right, his whole face lights up.  He gets so happy he can't stand still.  He tries to tell you he can do it again, but he's so excited he can't get it out for his stutter!  It sometimes takes him almost a minute to complete his thought.  I would gladly listen to him for an hour.  That kind of honest spontaneous joy is contagious.  When he first came to me, I couldn't get Omar to talk to me for anything, he was so shy.  Now when I see him he talks and talks and talks.  He asked if I would come to his birthday party today.  Said I was one of his best friends... The truth is, Omar will most likely never be an effective martial artist.  After a couple years he will probably lose interest.  99.9% of all people who start taking a martial art do.  But he will always look back at the school with a feeling of having accomplished something.  Whether Omar turns out to be a bum or a nuclear physicist, I know he will have had the experience of conquering his insecurities in at least part of his life.  I've seen it happen.  In that sense, he has already learned the most important lesson Kung Fu has to teach. Anything that lets you have that kind of impact on another person I think is a worthwhile endeavor.  After all, what is our legacy if not the effect we have had on others in our lifetime?  I plan on teaching when I move to New Orleans.  Just a few students informally.  5 - 10 maybe.  At a park or something.  But I doubt I will ever have another Omar.

      I'm sick.  Fever.  Everything seems washed out when you have a fever.  Like so much static.  White noise...  The weather was incredible today.  Most of the first round of blooms is in full gear.  I feel the weather as something personal this year.  Like this is the truest Spring i have experienced.  The begining of new growth.  I am excited for the future.  And more than a little nervous.  They say history repeats.  Jesus, I hope not. Found a roll of film in the bottom of my bag and had it developed today... It was from the party we had the last night we were in Hattiesburg!  Kev, Paul, Ben, Gary.... the whole crew (minus Crazy Mike).  Man i miss those bastards!  What a crazy time.  But I now have photographic evidence of the infamous "Wall O' Beer and Liquor."  Come to think of it - it is about one year exactly since Paul, Kev, Ben, and I floated down Mexico way.  Got stranded in Winnie Texas on the way back and somehow wound up drunk and swimming in a 35 degree pool at 4am at some hotel...  Here's to you guys, where ever you are!

      Thought of the day: "There are cracks in everything.  That's how the light gets in."  One of my students said I was wise today.  HA!  I'd like to thank the academy...   But seriously, since I have always been a stickler for Socratic definitions...  What does it mean to be wise?  I think it means having good judgment.  Good judgment comes from experience.  Experience comes from bad judgment.  Therefore, though I may not be wise, I have certainly laid some fertile ground for it.   Speaking of which, Alden and Grady and I are throwing a house warming party on Wednesday... So I fear I will have ample opportunity to lay even more fertile ground.  ;-) I think I will have to make a rule NOT to write here if I've been drinking, cause I'm sure I would feel I have lots to say.  Then again, I wont make a promise I cant keep.  Fuckin Irish.  I have been trying to write to match the music Joe and I have been messing around with.  Sometimes I find it much easier to express a thought musically than verbally.  I am reminded of a quote I cant remember who said it; "All you have to do in writing is stare at a blank piece of paper until drops of blood form on your brow."  Feels like it anyway.  I have a love hate relationship with words.  I revel in them.  I am in bliss with my books.  I feel I have some modicum of skill in their use.  Its interesting to think that I have been so attracted to Philosophy AND poetry.  Their use of words are so diametrically opposed.  The value of words in philosophy lies in their precision.  But the value of words in poetry lies in their ambiguity.  Ultimately however, I think words are totally and completely insufficient.  Lao Tzu said "That which can be expressed is not the eternal."  You're preachin to the choir brother.

        As the Time Draws Nigh    As the time draws nigh glooming a cloud, A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me.  I shall go forth, I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell wither or how long, Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice will suddenly cease.  O book, O chants!  must all then amount to but this? Must we barely arrive at this beggining of us? -and yet it is enough, O soul; O soul, we have positively appear'd - that is enough.  - Walt Whitman

      I can't wait to get back to New Orleans.  I am so ready to leave here.  Went to the Club night before last with Alden.  I hate clubs - definitely not my scene - but that's all there is down here.  There isn't really anywhere to just go sit and hang out...  I miss the Thirsty Hippo in Hattiesburg.  I noticed something strange though - There are two situations that put me in a very calm introspective mood; being alone in the woods or in the mountains etc, and being anonymous in a crowd of people.  I experienced it the whole time we were in downtown Miami as well...  I will sit and people watch for hours and have a blast doing it. I definitely approach the whole club thing differently than Alden does.  He is truly in his environment there - talking to every girl who walks by, on the dance floor, etc.  You have to love that kind of predictability.  Don't get me wrong - I can operate in that type of environment - I just don't want to.  I find I have nothing to say to these people.  Which brought me to a revelation; what I'm seeking in a woman is not sex - I could find that easily enough - I am seeking that connection.  I want to feel fucking  inspired  by someone.     For some reason I have been thinking about a lot of my past relationships recently.  It occurs to me that I have failed almost all of them.  Almost every female I have sought that connection in I have failed.  I failed Robbie.  I failed Stacy.  I failed Erin... Marjorie, Lauren, Julie, etc etc.  In the end I could not be what any of them sought in me.  I always moved on from these relationships either seeking that connection - that something higher; or disillusioned that I would never find it.  I would think that I am just being naive - that the person I am looking for doesn't exist - that there is no connection to be found.  But I have felt it.  Once, maybe twice, I have found that connection, or come so very close to it.  And in these cases, where I held nothing back, they failed me.  ironic.  I think that is what love must be.  Laying bare your weaknesses to someone.  Your vulnerability.  We go through most of our days wearing various masks.  You act one way at work.  Another way with your friends etc.  Love is laying down all masks and just being what you are underneath... The problem is that this baring of ourselves leaves us vulnerable to that person.  If your burned then, it is that much harder to bare yourself again. I keep thinking of the characters of Franz and Sabina in that book Colette suggested - the Unbearable Lightness of Being.  I am both of these people.  The dreamer and the one always moving.  Impermanence.  Trying to end a string of betrayals. Last night I spent at Joe and Dinas playing music late into the night.  I've been thinking about something Joe said all morning.  That we go through themes in our life.  Periods where you keep thinking about a specific concept or idea.  Maybe even place or person.  At least I experience this.  Most of the time, these themes are in the background.  Every once in awhile though...  The theme of impermanence is driven home to me recently as it rarely has been.  I moved again (I counted - this is the 19th place I've lived.)  And I'm moving again in a month and a half.  All the people that have come and gone in my life... the things I've been, the places I've seen... What I really feel I need is a clean start.  Maybe that is why I've devoted so much thought to the connection I am ever losing in others.... I think New Orleans will be a clean start for me.  But I have obligations to settle here first.  Miles to go before I sleep and all....

      Yesterday in the wee small hours, I got to talk to a friend that i never thought i'd hear from again.  It was kind of like talking to a ghost.  Or dreaming.  I mean, for all intents and porposes - it was like this person died to me.  Completely lost contact.  And then after a couple years one night, BAMN - like a ghost from the past or a dream that doesn't really seem real the next day. But its a good dream. Its strange to think about the people that have made big impacts on your life.  Some have been there for years and become part of you.  Others you meet in passing or have a brief encounter with - and that person also makes an indelible impact. Of course today i thought of a million questions i would have loved to have asked but didn't.  Its comforting to know that there are some ghosts out there who i can still talk to every so often.

      Ahh what an evening.  Spent the night listening to Jim Flanagan at the Irish Coast with Joe, Dina, and Jason.  Whatever else he is, Flanagan is a great barroom musician.  Counted the Guinness as they stacked up while we banged in rythem on the table and i belted out choruses from old Irish songs I haven't heard in years.  It was fun. Driving home on the way back we took the beach and once again (and I'm sure not for the last time) the vastness of the water struck me and the moon lighting up the clouds from behind while they towered above us.  How immense they were.  And the few stars peeking behind them - just imagine the spance they hint at in the fleetingly glanced appearences they make from the small back window of the car.  How petty our lives are when compared to this.  How insignificant our sorrows and joys - our concerns and fears.  The whole of the Earth lies stretched before us and we each remain confined in our own little bubble of reality - totally distant from one another, going about our tiny details on this small little planet while all the while the realization escapes us of the smallness of we.  An immesnse joy strikes me at these times and i think to myself smallness is no bad thing.

      Great knowledge is all-encompassing; small knowledge is limited.  Great words are inspiring; small words are chatter.  When we are asleep, we are in touch with our souls.  When we are awake, our senses open.  We get involved with our activities and our minds are distracted.  Sometimes we are hesitant, sometimes underhanded, and sometimes secretive.  Little fears cause anxiety, and great fears cause panic.  Our words fly off like arrows, as though we knew what was right and wrong.  We cling to our own point of view, as though everything depended on it.  And yet our opinions have no permanence; like autumn and winter, they gradually pass away.  We are caught in the current and cannot return.  We are tied up in knots like an old clogged drain; we are getting closer to death with no way to regain our youth.  Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness, hope and fear, indecision and strength, humility and willfulness, enthusiasm and insolence, like music sounding from an empty reed or mushrooms rising from the warm dark earth, continually appear before us day and night.  No one knows whence they come.  Don't worry about it!  Let them be!  How can we understand it all in one day?                          - Chuang Tsu: Inner Chapters

      OK, seriously - it's time you stop playing with my emotions.  I've given you all the attention in the world, and all you have done is string me along for a long time now, and I'm sick of it.  JUST TELL ME WHAT THE RELEASE DATE FOR WORLD OF WARCRAFT WILL BE!  Come on Blizzard - I HAVE TO KNOW!  Hasn't our relationship meant at least that much to you?  Bastards... So apparently its back to Hattiesburg.  I went up there yesterday.  Alot of the time i spent figuring myself out was up there.  I saw so many times and friends come and go in that place... When we all left there almost a year ago exactly, it was with much regret - that was truly one of the best times in my life.  Given this, I figured that being back in that city i would have alot of different emotions, but i didn't.  I really didn't feel anything.  It just felt... familiar. Like your room.  You dont think about how you feel about your room - its just there.  Completely familair.  Unless it is a background feeling of comfort in that familiarity; like a sanctuary.  That was my experience. I find it odd that i will wind up back there in the same apartment no less, with Paul!  Life is crazy.  But if southern will pay for my school, right now i would be stupid not to go.  I am sick of working these noncommital jobs and just getting by.  Its time i finish my degree. Wow.  Back to Hattiesburg...  Ever heard that old Irish folk song "the Wild Rover?"  Apparently it is wrong.

      The Most of It  He thought he kept the universe alone; For all the voice in answer he could wake Was but the mocking echo of his own From some tree-hidden cliff across the lake. Some morning from the boulder-broken beach He would cry out on life, that what it wants Is not its own love back in copy speech, But counter-love, original response. And nothing ever came of what he cried Unless it was the embodiment that crashed In the cliff's talus on the other side, And then in the far-distant water splashed, But after a time allowed for it to swim, Instead of proving human when it neared And someone else additional to him, As a great buck it powerfully appeared, Pushing the crumpled water up ahead, And landed pouring like a waterfall, And stumbled through the rocks with horny tread, And forced the underbrush--and that was all.  - Robert Frost

      It's the small things.  The fleeting.  The passing stupid moments.  No, I kinow - it sounds all wrong.  How could it the the passing things?  We spend our whole lives seeking the big answers.  We want the whole cake.  The big enchilada.  That's where i will find myself.  Find happiness.  Like religion.  This huge sweeping organization - this club will tell me where truth lies.  The big answer.  If only i had true religion i would be fulfilled.  Or love.  True love.  If i could find my soulmate i would truly be alive.  Or the perfect job.  Or if i explored life more. nope.  Not even close. You could spend your whole life devoted to any of these - working toward the big picture, still to find in the end that you are only chasing your tail.  Only to find that the whole time you were working to realize what you were looking for you passed it on the way and didn't even see it. Its the small things.  Look there.  Its the passing cloud you stop for a moment upon seeing and say, wow!  Its the falling leaf.  Its a stupid insipid cartoon.  Cheezy and over played.  But in the middle, BAM!  The truth is sitting there staring at you.  Its in a fleeting smile.  A passing eye.  A familiar face.  In the day to day.  In the coffee.  In the shower. In the worst moments of your life, you will only find comfort in the small things.  Look in the grass.  Behind the tree.  In the cheezy and honest.  Remember this.

      Went to the Museum and sculpture garden with Joe and Dina today.  Whoever did the driftwood horse and "Adam" is amazing.  I really dug the cultural arts floor - the Japanese and Oceana/ Polynesia stuff was awesome.  I am amazed at the degree to which art can convey if you give the right pieces the right time. Music is the same.  Music amazes me.  Seeing Joe as immersed as he is helps me remember how much music has helped move certain themes and parts in my life.  Or at least make those times somehow easier to bear.  Times in our lives become defined by the music we live in during those times.  Everyone has some cd they can listen to to evoke the feeling; the soul of a particular period in your life. I am amazed that a certain nuance of breathe in the flute can change a single correct note into an expression of pure sorrow or longing or joy.  I think the best parts of all of us are said more tuly in the wordlessness of music than they ever could be with labels and the exactness of speech. There is such a depth out there to see and experience.  I want to float on my back and enjoy the feeling of depth below me and then  just   slowly    sink       ...   Courtney - I know you said you leave today.  Good luck in Europe!

      I found out i was lied to today.  By someone i trusted.  It hurts to know i completely misjudged someone.  That they are, despite everything i thought - a bad person.  They have not even had the balls to tell me.  I doubt they ever will.  What a fucking waste that time was.  They are no better than those they despise.  Worse.  Redemption can always come - but never fot those too weak to seek it.

      CLOSURE PART I Something inside went off.  As soon as the phone went dead.  Something shifted.  That's it.  I let go.  Done.  I think what i have really needed to do - and what i was not letting myself do - was to be able to "fuck it."  Its amazing how much better i feel.  I was so into this - i had no perspective.   Imagine someone holding your head under water, only you didn't know you were drowning.  All you know is you are desperately trying to breathe and can't.  All of a sudden the hand is gone and you come up for air, and then it all seems really really simple.  Oh, shit, I was underwater.  Way to go, j. Whatever i was trying to grasp - whatever i was trying to hold on to i dropped, and as soon as i did, i could see exactly where i lost myself.  Why i couldn't feel where i was.  Why i was desperately grasping over and over and over when there was no fucking point.  I feel much more like myself now.  Thank god. Right now what i feel most is really really embarrassed.  Man, what a clinging jerk ive been.  I am amazed that someone can affect me like that still.  I guess i still have a loooong way to go yet into myself. SO... lessons learned?  Nothing i should not have already known.  Be careful where you open your heart.  Be careful who you choose to believe in.  Even if they are, at heart, good and deep and beautiful, people always have the capacity to hurt you, especially when you open to them completely and selflessly and they can't deal with it.   Maybe this is Karma for the way i know i must have hurt Robbi.  And Sara.  Marjorie.  Erin.  etc.   I saw a bumber sticker that looked like the VISA logo and read - "KARMA - it's everywhere you want to be!"  Aint it the truth?  :-)  I seem to have a knack for becoming involved with women whom i either have no connection with other than just to pass time in eachothers company who go on to get really attatched to me, or finding these really soulful sacred connections with people who are either unwilling or unable to open themselves as i have opened myself. I suppose it is better to have attempted than to always wonder, but i hope i learn from this to be much much more careful where i place my faith, because the hurt that i felt has made me realize that faith is a very limited commodity.  You spend it here and there, but eventually, if it is not redeemed, it will run out completely.  And i dont want to be that person. Jen, bless you for the pints and the ear last night, you are truly a saint.   This move has been so hard.  Sitting on the levee with Nobi this morning, listening to the water, i can't help but feel i dont really belong here.  I think i will give myself a little more time in New Orleans.  But if things dont look up soon, well - back to the road.  At least now I feel i can put all this shit behind me.  Time to see what this city has for me.  PART II I dreamt of Aimee last night.  I guess that's not suprising, considering all the stupid drama lately.  After all, she was the last person i felt a deep connection with like this.  That turned out even worse than this.  I think that dealing with this will maybe help me let go of her finally as well.  Its been 2 years now.  2 YEARS!  And i am still carrying that summer with me.  I still find myself wondering where she is - what she is thinking.  What would she say about all of this.  I hope i dont lose ALL contact with this connection like i did with her.  In my dream, we were at the Hippo.  The night she dropped the bottle in the street. lol...  She told me something in the dream.  Something i remember waking up and thinking was really important, and that i have to remember when i wake.  But this morning it was gone.  Still... whatever it was, it made me feel better about myself.  I'll be ok now.  Wherever you are, girl - cheers.  "Pilgrim"  Pilgrim, how you journey on the road you chose to find out why the winds die and where the stories go. All days come from one day that much you must know, you cannot change what's over but only where you go. One way leads to diamonds, one way leads to gold, another leads you only to everything you're told. In your heart you wonder which of these is true; the road that leads to nowhere, the road that leads to you.  Will you find the answer in all you say and do? Will you find the answer In you? Each heart is a pilgrim, each one wants to know the reason why the winds die and where the stories go. Pilgrim, in your journey you may travel far, for pilgrim it's a long way to find out who you are... Pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are...  Pilgrim, it's a long way to find out who you are

      Aaaahhh... internet.  If only for a moment.  Needed a fix.  Bless the public library.  I called about getting cable modem installed next week at my house, so hopefully the online hiatus will be over directly.  The cable company down here is called Cox, and not without reason.  I'm sure i will wind up forking over the exorbitant amount they are asking - my only hope is that the installation comes with a free jar of vasoline to ease the pain of getting fucked by these bastards.

      What an emotional fucking rollercoaster the last few weeks have been!  No wonder i haven't felt centered.  Who the hell could?  You pack up your entire life and move somewhere new.  New Job.  New Place.  New problems.  No money.  Hope you like these four walls buddy, that's all your gonna get for a while.  I can't wait till this week is over and i can go out.  You have a girlfirend - er wait, no you dont.  No its cool, yes you do.  Damn, no you dont. Sigh.  OK, time to take one giant emotional step backwards.  As in the opposite direction I want to go.  As in the opposite direction everything in my being tells me feels good and right.  Sure.  No problem.  Don't feel anymore.  Right.   So do i let myself be completely open?  Do i let myself feel whatever it is i will feel and risk having my heart tore out again?  Hattiesburg all over again... to finally glimpse a soul i want to share with but know that i can't walk with that person...  Or do i squash my natural impulses and distance myself till i feel ...nothing?  Isn't this worth enough to try and keep something alive while she deals with her issues?  Survey sais....  who the fuck knows?  It was the first thought i had upon waking this morning.  And that is not a good sign. Hiatus over.  I'm driving back to this new world today.  It is a gorgeous day.  I always feel so at peace in travel.  I wish the drive would never end.  I dont want to reach my destination.  Peace of mind is in the now all around me.  If only i can quiet my heart enough to find it... Remember that old REM song - I forget the name, but its on the GREEN album  Sometimes i feel like i cant even sing I'm very scared for this world  i'm very scared for me Viscerate your memory; heres a scene,  your in the backseat laying down the windows wrap around you the sound  of the travel and the engine all you hear is time stand still in travel you feel such peace and absolute -  the stillness still it doesn't end but slowly drifts into sleep the stars are the greatest thing  you've ever seen and they're there for you for you alone you are the everything.

      For the longest time in my life i have felt like a wanderer.  Always walking on my path.  Even when i come to a place i truly want to stay.... it seems i must always wearily turn my eyes back to the road before me.  Once again, and as it always has...  it seems i must walk ever alone. I hate this.  I hate the inevitability i feel in it.  More than anything i hate knowing that it is correct and right and that yes, this is the way it must be.  I hate having to say "So be it" and i hate embracing that sentance with my entire being.  But there it is.  So be it.  Sigh. Some of you have asked me what the Gaelic at the top of the page sais.  It is a translation from an enya song.  Roughly, it sais;  From day to day, my journey, The long pilgrimage before me. From night to night, my journey, The stories that will never be again.

      Wow.  What a crazy couple of weeks!  I am moved to New Orleans and struggling to settle into the daily grind of a completely new life.  Its been bumpy at best so far, but starting anew anywhere is always a challenge.  I've worked my ass off last week.  I have dealt with minor problem after problem after problem  (no hot water - no money - locked out - car flooded - etcetera etcetera ad nauseum.)  I found out that i am not above pettiness and had to break someone's heart (again) just in the last few days. It has all been a bit overwhelming to say the least.  The major obstacle is that i am now realizing i have a whole new life to build now.  A life about ME and what it is i want to be.  Not about any other person or job or expectation.  Thinking of it that way it seems exciting.  Everything seems up in the air.  I have this whole new phase in my life that is beginning - and nothing in it is sure.  It could shape into one thing - it could shape into another.  Most likely it will shape itself into something i have not even dreamt of.  Everything is in question.  There is no escaping impermanence.   I was given a book recently titled "Hardcore Zen: Punkrock, monster movies, and the truth about reality" (i know - how could i not dig a book with that title?)  and in it there was a quote that has stuck with me the last few days:  "From birth to death, all like this."  Woah.  Rock my world.   We tend to live our lives wandering what it is that will make us happy.  Enter the realm of if only's.  If only i had this or that job.  If only i had that busty redhead or the hot guy next door.  If only i really   knew   myself or what it is i really want.  If only i didn't live in this shit hole or with my cousin or relatives or wife and 12 kids.  If only this or that fill in the blank, i would be happy. No.  You missed the point.  From birth to death - all like this.  This is all you get.  Here.  Now.  You are this moment.  This moment is you.  You are the computer screen you are staring at right now.  There is no other better fantasy life somewhere else.  Only now.  You want to find happiness? There is only one place to look.  The question is what are you going to do with the now you have?  What life will you make for yourself?  I am in the process of deciding what the rest of my life will be.  Saturn returns.

      Well, day after tommorrow Nobi and I move into our new box.  Signed a year lease, and i fully intend to stay there for the whole year at least, if not longer.  I am tired of moving.  It seems like i have done nothing but this year.  More than that, I'm tired of floating here and there.  Wherever whim and circumstance take me.  Its what i have always done, but it is really wearing on me this year.  Time i finish my degree.  I have not been writing here lately, but its not really because i have nothing to say... in fact its closer that i have too much to say.  I feel like a whole year has been packed into the last few months and now...  I hope that this weekend, after the move is over i will have some time for reflection.  Yesterday i stood outside and watched a thunder storm roll toward me.  It was amazing.  You could feel it coming.  The temperature dropped - i could smell it in the wind that picked up.  I could see the rain coming like a wall down the street, and then envelope me.   My mind dwells.  It keeps returning to a lost and longed for landscape.  I cant seem to stop it.  Surely there must be some reason for this to be happening again?  time will tell.

      I figured it out! Haha! I have come to a realization that will rock the very foundations of the intelligence community around the globe! The two primary justifications we were fed for going to war in Iraq was 1. the dreaded weapons of mass destruction (which were never found) and 2. the connection between Osama and Sadaam, which the independent commision investigating the justice departments handling of all this bs said last week does not exist.  Now, those of you who know my political leanings may be suprised to know that i happen to think there ARE weapons of mass destruction in Iraq! That's right! I figured out why we haven't found them yet! It all fits! They are with all the other things we cant find or prove.  The way i figure it, the notorius WoMD are hidden in a cave that was magically turned invisible by a little leprechan turned radical Sunni muslum. Yeah. Thats right. They are being garded by the Tooth Fairy and the Easter bunny who are also stockpiling all of the worlds missing left socks in preparation for the march of their evil elf army. They have formed a secret terrorist cell with these weapons of mass destruction; TTDFE, or THINGS THAT DONT FUCKING EXIST.  Think this is a revelation? Wait till my next entry where i explore the link between Osama, Sadaam, and the true evil master mind, SANTA!!!!!

      The calendar of ancient Sumer had 360 days in it, plus 5 days which were not counted.  These were holy festival days which were considered outside of the field of time - of day to day temporal existence; in which the transcendent world of being beyond the field of time was thought to intersect with the field of our experience, and man was in the realm of nonduality.  What an awesome idea.  It's too bad we have lost the ability to think in mythological terms like that.  We are slaves to our Rolex's (or in my case, cheap ass dollar store watches.)

      Nietzsche said "One must want nothing to be different.  Not forward, not back, not in all eternity.  Not only to bear what is neccesary, but to love it."  In other words, one must embrace the whole of one's fate in order to live as a genuine person.  This entails embracing the good and the bad.  It means doing away with thoughts of "if only" and embracing even those things in your life that you wish had turned out differently. Henry Rollins said "Fuck those people who say 'when life gives you lemons, make lemonade!'  I say, when life gives you lemons, say OH YEAH I like lemons, what else you got?"  ;-)  Bring it on. It is our  total  experience that makes us who we are.  Right view will determine wether you see that as a crutch or a tool.

      I am Buddhist.  The first of the 4 noble truths in Buddhism is usually translated as “All life is suffering.”  For a long time I discounted Buddhism because of this and the second of the four noble truths; that all suffering arises from desire (also a mistranslation.)  I think I understand much better now what they were getting at.  I think a better translation would be life involves suffering or even better life involves loss.  Still better (and my personal spin) “the essence of life lies in entropy.”  In other words everything is dying.  Each minute of your life that ticks away is a moment you will never have again.  All of the worlds ancient myths recognize this fact.  In order for there to be life, there must first be death.  That cycle is the essence of being and becoming on this planet.  The body of an animal is killed and eaten to provide others with sustanence and energy.  The plant which decays provides nourishment for the next seedling.  These images have always been and are still with us.  From Kali the destroyer to The apocryphal flood stories of ancient Sumer and even the old Testement, to the Lion King and the “cirle of Life”.  Nothing new.  So all life is in this state of entopy.  The moment you are born, you are dying.  Sound depressing?  I don’t mean it to.  I don’t find it depressing in the least.  Joseph Campbell:  “As soon as there is time, there is suffering.  You can’t have a future unless you have a past, and if you are in love with the present, it becomes past, whatever it is.  Loss, death, birth, loss, death – and so on.”  I’ve never been a really big fan of religion.  I think that religion attempt to codify and place structure upon that which transcends all such particulars.  The first line of the Tao Teh Ching is “That which can be expressed is not the eternal.”  The Ultimate reality, or Nirvana, or Vishnu, or God, or whatever label you feel comfortable with, is only to be found in oneself or not at all.  I’ve never found group attempts at spirituality to be genuine.  The spiritual is the personal.  Those two are one and the same.  What awakens the spiritual or sense of awe in you may not do it for me.  The trick is to find what triggers it for you and dive in.   In particular I am not a fan of Christianity.  For one, I have met only a handful of Christians who actually know the core beliefs of Christianity.  Fewer know the history of their religion (councils of Nicea anyone?), fewer still know anything about other religions.  No other religion that I have come across, as a whole, harbours so many people so devoutly ignorant of their own belief structure.  The atrocities that have been commited in the name of Christianity (and that continue to be commited to this day) are enough to make Jesus turn Hindu.  Nevertheless, it is amazing to compare the impulse behind different religions.  And if you look into the Christian hermetic and mystic traditions – such as the Christian Gnostics, there are some very deep and profound insights to be had.  But these forms of the faith resemble very little Billy Joe Bobs Big Baptist Church that you’ll find on any given corner down here in the Bible Belt. In fact, there are even valid comparisons to be drawn between the Gnostic forms of Christianity and Buddhism.  Again, Joseph Campbell:  “The Christ story involves a sublimation of what originally was a very solid vegetal image.  Jesus is on Holy Rood, the tree, and he is himself the fruit of the tree.  Jesus is the fruit of eternal life, which was on the second forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden.  When man ate of the fruit of the first tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he was expelled from the Garden.  The Garden is the place of unity, of nonduality of male and female, good and evil, God and human beings.  You eat the duality, and you are on the way out.  The tree of coming back to the Garden is the tree of immortal life, where you know that I and the Father are one. 	Getting back into that Garden is the aim of many a religion.  When Yahweh threw man out of the Garden, he put two cherubim at the gate, with a flaming sword between.  Now, when you approach a Buddhist shrine, with the Buddha seated under the tree of immortal life, you will find at the gate two guardians – those are the cherubim, and you’re going between them to the tree of immortal life.  In the Christian tradition, Jesus on the cross is on a tree, the tree of immortal life, and he is the fruit of the tree.  Jesus on the cross, the Buddha under the tree – these are the same figures.  And the cherubim at the gate – who are they?  At the Buddhist shrines you’ll see one has his mouth open, the other has his mouth closed – fear and desire, a pair of opposites.  If you’re approaching a garden like that, and these two figures are real to you and threaten you, if you have fear for your life, you are still outside the garden.  But if you are no longer attached to your ego existence, but see the ego existence as a function of a larger, eternal totality, and you favor the larger against the smaller, then you won’t be afraid of those two figures, and you will go through.”  Good shit, eh?

      Feeling very solitary.  Enjoying the time to myself.  I've taken alot in recently.  Guess this is me processing.  I feel the urge to get lost in the forrest somewhere.  Not another human for miles.  There is no solitude as complete as when you are with yourself at night miles from civilization.  I miss it.   I wonder if i could pull off being celibate? I wonder if I will be able to hear Alden laugh when he reads that? Its always the old wound.  Always it comes back to this.  Just me.  Say goodbye again. Finally watched Dead man by Jim Jarmusch.  First half wasn't very good, but i was into it by the end.  And the allegory holds.  We are all dead.  Just waiting for our send off on the great ocean.  So what are you going to do between now and then?  Let go, dumbass.

       Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you, You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me as of a dream,) I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you, All is recall'd as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured, You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,  I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours only nor left me body mine only, You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake at night alone, I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again, I am to see to it that I do not lose you.        - Walt Whitman  An old Roman once said - "The fates lead him who will.  Him who won't they drag." And we journey on.

      Hmm... it seems i have lots of ghosts popping up from my past recently.  This is a positive thing. So Dena loaned me this dvd  Postcards From the Future; the Chuck Palahniuk Documentary , which is basically just footage from a conference held on his work, and one of the things he said which struck me was this; "...it really demonstrates how strong we attatch to story; because we know that money comes and goes, and we know that possessions become a burden - they  really  become a burden, but stories... a story is always valuable and its something that is so painless to carry with us, and its something that we share... Ultimately the most important thing in your life is going to be story." I've rarely heard a better description of why history grips me.  After all, that's what history is.  Story telling.  More than that it is the telling of  our  story.  I've been steeped lately in settling things for my degree, so its nice to be reminded of what attracted me to history in the first place.  So many times i meet people who say they hated history when they had to take it in school, and 9 times out of 10 they had some dumbass football coach who didn't know jack teaching the class because the school board makes him teach something besides football, so he figures history is easy.  Doesn't care about the material, isn't passionate about it and often dumbs down the material so his players can make A's.        My entire perception of things has changed having studied history for a while now.  Glance through the paper or look at the buildings on your street or who lives in a certain area of town and who doesn't, or why that non-native plant or animal is in your yard, and you will see the surface of what is there.  With a sense of history though, everything you look at becomes like the surface of a pool of water.  You never know how deep the water is - it could be 3 inches or 3 miles, but you realize that there is depth behind everything you see.  There is story.      Think of the earliest people telling stories to their clan or tribe around the campfire.  Every culture recognizes a special position of someone who keeps the tales.  Shaman or poet or what have you.  And rightly so.  The keepers of the stories - what they are keeping in fact is the soul of the collective people.  The tale of who they are... in which is inherent where they are going.  They are the watchers of the tribe.  History for me serves the same function.

       urlLink    What if a demon were to creep after you one night, in your loneliest loneliness, and say, 'This life which you live must be lived by you once again and innumerable times more; and every pain and joy and thought and sigh must come again to you, all in the same sequence.' Would you throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse that demon? Or would you answer, 'Never have I heard anything more divine?'" --Nietzsche &nbsp; urlLink

      I recently got back my copy of "the Power of Myth" from someone i had loaned it to and am re-reading it (again).  Everytime, I notice something i overlooked. MOYERS: You changed the definition of a myth from the  search  for meaning to the  experience  of meaning. CAMPBELL: Experience of  life .  The mind has to do with meaning.  What's tyhe meaning of a flower?  There's a Zen story about a sermon of the Buddha in which he simply lifted a flower.  There was only one man who gave him a sign with his eyes that he understood what was said.  Now, the Buddha himself is called "the one thus come."  There's no meaning.  What's the meaning of the universe?  What's the meaning of a flea?  It's just there.  That's it.  And your own meaning is that you're there.  We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget that the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what its all about.

      YOU KNOW YOU'RE DRUNK WHEN... you start making deals with yourself and your drink.&nbsp; IE "ok... i will not take another sip of this Guinness until the next song."&nbsp; Or.. um... so i am told.&nbsp; ahem. Anyway... what a good day..&nbsp; Slept in... paid some bills off, cleaned up the house, sushi for dinner, and hung out at the Hippo with friends and heard my boy Willy P's band (the Squirms) play.&nbsp; They kicked ass. These past couple of weeks have been awesome.&nbsp; I feel i have gone so much deeper into myself than i have in a loooong time.&nbsp; I think that part of it is being in an environment again where i am comfortable and familiar - this has afforded me room to look at myslef more than worry about moving or whatnot.&nbsp; A bigger part however is laying to rest attachments i have carried with me for a long time. Bear with me in a too long analogy - i am more or less drunk.&nbsp; Imagine you are sleeping.&nbsp; A deep deep sleep, but you are dreaming that you are awake.&nbsp; Someone comes to you and wakes you up and shows you not only that you were sleeping, but that reality has to offer so much more than your dreams ever did.&nbsp; Then they are gone.&nbsp; poof.&nbsp; You have to go back to sleep, but you really really dont want to.&nbsp; You want to&nbsp;remain in wakefulness and explore&nbsp;the&nbsp;one who awoke in you the desire to be in this dreamlike reality.&nbsp; You don't want to go back to sleep.&nbsp; But they are gone.&nbsp; You will never see them again.&nbsp; So you fall back to dreaming... but everyone in your dream is compared and contrasted to that person.&nbsp; What would you do? Eventually you would wake up again on your own.&nbsp; And when you did, you will still remember with fondness the person who woke you from your sleep - then you would carry on fully awake. But what if you had the chance to connect with that person again?&nbsp; And this time you could do it fully awake and aware?&nbsp; How would you direct the opportunity?&nbsp; What would you think?&nbsp; What would you feel?&nbsp; For whatever reason you crossed paths again,&nbsp;would you not resolve to see through the story that was never told?&nbsp; With the opportunity to be fully awake this time - blind faith with eyes wide open.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter&nbsp;of the outcome, the joy that comes from dreaming the dream AND exploring your waking reality is a source of strength and motivation; regardless of the length of the road.&nbsp; After all, the journey  is  the destination.&nbsp;  I have slept very soundly of late, and my waking is filled with quietness, joy, longing, and eagerness.

      So today I finished reading  Dharma Punx , by Noah Levine (added a link on the sidebar if anyone is interested), and thought I would pass along a couple of the paragraphs from the epilogue.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddhism and punk rock obviously have some huge differences.&nbsp; But for me they are both part of a single thread that has been stitched through every aspect of my life.&nbsp; My search for happiness, which first led me to drugs and punk rock, is the same search that eventually brought me to spiritual practice.&nbsp; The truth is, going against the internal stream of ignorance is way more rebellious than trying to start some sort of cultural revolution.&nbsp; It's easy to hate and point out everything that is wrong with the world; it is the hardest and most important work in one's life to free oneself from the bonds of fear and attachment.&nbsp; Compassion is our only hope, wisdom our weapon.&nbsp; The inner revolution will not be televised or sold on the Internet.&nbsp; It must take place within one's own mind and heart.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of this is to say: wake up!&nbsp; Look at your own life and see what is true about yourself.&nbsp; Freedom is available, the trick is to stop looking out there for it and to sit down, shut up, and see for yourself that your truest nature, however deeply buried or obscured, is closer to love than anything else.

      I am beginning to feel more at peace with myself than i have ina loooong time.&nbsp; This year has been so hectic up to now, it has left little room for reflection.&nbsp; I realize now that i am in a position to take stock of where i have been, where i am, and where i want to go.&nbsp; Gone is the anxiety and doubt i felt a few days ago.&nbsp; I can see that i am causing my own doubts, and i can see the behaviors which perpetuate them.&nbsp; I no longer feel that i need any questions answered.&nbsp; I have felt a deep, quiet, and profound joy with me all day today.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.&nbsp; Sometimes, I think&nbsp;sleep and time are the best psychologists... Doors are opening in my mind that i had shut, and i can feel new growth.&nbsp; My meditations are deeper and more peaceful than they have yet been this year, and i feel... open.&nbsp; I feel free of expectation.     Night Ride Across the Caucasus      &nbsp;  Ride on through the night Ride on   There are visions, there are memories  There are echoes of thundering hooves  There are fires, there is laughter  There's the sound of a thousand doves   In the velvet of the darkness  By the silhouette of silent trees  They are watching waiting  They are witnessing life's mysteries   Cascading stars on the slumbering hills  They are dancing as far as the sea  Riding o'er the land, you can feel its gentle hand  Leading on to its destiny   Take me with you on this journey  Where the boundaries of time are now tossed  In cathedrals of the forest  In the words of the tongues now lost   Find the answers, ask the questions  Find the roots of an ancient tree  Take me dancing, take me singing  I'll ride on till the moon meets the sea  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Loreena McKennitt

      Ahh... Another Wednesday night at the Hippo and open mic.&nbsp; So much for me recovering from being sick and staying in for tonight...&nbsp; Like most of the names for days of the week in the English language, Wednesday comes from Norse mythology.&nbsp; Wednesday = Wodan's day, or Odin's day.&nbsp; (Tuesday Tyr's day, Thursday Thor's day, Friday Frey's day.)&nbsp; Odin is a fascinating deity.&nbsp;&nbsp;In norse mythology, Odin sacrificed himself on the Yggdrasil tree for&nbsp;nine days and nine nights to gain knowledge of the runes.&nbsp; The Yggdrasil = the  axis mundi &nbsp;- the center of creation.&nbsp; The place where being and becoming are one.&nbsp; You see this all over world mythology (the translation of the characters for China, for example, mean the middle kingdom - the center - NewGrange was considered the center for the ancient Irish, the pyramids at Giza etc etc... this pops up in Buddhism as the tree where Buhdda gained enlightenment and the tree of Immortality in the Garden of Eden in Christianity&nbsp;- the cross on which Jesus hung and so on).&nbsp; Odin sacrificed one eye in the well of Mir for the gift of prophecy.&nbsp; A metaphor for the sacrifice needed to gain knowledge.&nbsp; After this sacrifice, he was attended always by two crows - named&nbsp;Thought and Memory.&nbsp; It was neccessary for him - &nbsp;after this gift - to consume for ever and always the mead of the gods, brewed from golden apples (which also pop up all over world mythology.)&nbsp; In other words, the knowledge came with a price.&nbsp; For Odin - the price was the knowledge of Ragnarok, and to stay sane, he had to stay inebriated constantly.&nbsp; They don't make gods like that anymore, lol.&nbsp; Odin survives today primarily in the incarnation of Santa Clause.&nbsp; (there are no fir trees in Jerusulem after all - where did you think we got that tradition from?)&nbsp; There is a deeper level to everything around you.&nbsp; Even the names of the days of the week.&nbsp; One only needs eyes to see and ears to hear, as the ancient saying goes.   What has occupied my mind the whole night at the Hippo?&nbsp; It is true that I believe that it is our own conceptions which shape our reality.&nbsp; But from where do our conceptions arise?&nbsp; There is an old Tibetan meditation in which you contemplate who you are.&nbsp; It is done by a process of elimination.&nbsp; IE - I am not my body, I am not my status, I am not my name, etc etc until you are left with... what exactly?&nbsp; The crows of thought and memory?&nbsp;  I will sleep now.&nbsp; But where are you tonight?&nbsp; And do dreams of these birds disturb your rest?

      Damn it i'm sick.&nbsp; >:-(&nbsp; So much for camping on my days off.&nbsp; Looks like i'll be catching up on my reading instead.&nbsp; It has been kind of nice chilling at the house for a couple days.&nbsp; I've had a chance to catch up with a lot of friends (some i didn't think i would ever get to) and that&nbsp;makes me very happy.&nbsp;  I feel more rested now than i have in a while.&nbsp; Things have been so crazy this year - moving and moving and moving again.&nbsp; Drama emotional and financially...&nbsp;just second guessing myself in general, then trying to get settled here in Hattiesburg...&nbsp;It's been three weeks now since i moved up here, and i feel like that time has been one great big deep breath.&nbsp; A breath that is not quite over with yet - but i can see now that i am settling in.&nbsp; I still have a lot of unanswered questions, but i am looking forward to once again being in a position&nbsp;where my life is in enough order to allow me to focus on my progress - on the direction i am headed, and the path i will choose to take to get there.&nbsp; I feel another big push coming on - a period of growth.&nbsp; I have a lot i want to lay to rest before that happens, and there is some anxiety and doubt i need to let go of first, but i am headed in the right direction and that feels good.  I came to a realization yesterday that there is still one big question out there i am far too attached to.&nbsp; Something i feel i need to know the answer to or i'm going to make myself crazy.&nbsp; My fear is that my attachment to this question may keep it from being answered as it should be.&nbsp; In the fullness of time.&nbsp; But for the life of me, i don't know how to let go of this attachment.&nbsp; Maybe my questions will be answered face to face.&nbsp; Maybe it will only cause more questions.&nbsp; I find myself impatient and not content in my waiting,&nbsp;but i am not ready for anything else yet.&nbsp; So much of our lives are spent waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually i am content with whatever i am doing in the moment, but this one has thrown me for a loop since day one.&nbsp; Like i said - i still have far too much attachment to this one question.&nbsp; Time will tell...

      I love rain.&nbsp; Of course, down here in the south at this time of year sometimes it will&nbsp;storm for days and days without letting up, and that gets old, but today is the first time it has rained in at least a week or so.&nbsp; It always has a calming effect on me.&nbsp; I could watch and listen to it for hours.&nbsp; If nothing else, at least the heat lets up a bit.&nbsp;  Haven't been posting here much lately - Since i've been back in Hattiesburg, I've found myself going out almost every night.&nbsp; Catching up with old friends and making new ones.&nbsp; I spent a little over a month commuting back and forth from the coast while i crashed with friends or the folks, so I think I'm just enjoying the freedom to once again be able to do that.&nbsp; Unlike some of the old crew though, I find i can't live that life for long without feeling guilty.&nbsp; I don't feel guilt because&nbsp; of some&nbsp;external societal pressure or anything like that, and there is of course, nothing wrong with going out every night, but i have always felt a little too driven to be content with going out drinking and carrying on, sleeping till noon, going to work, and going out again for an extended period of time.&nbsp; I think its healthy to do that every so often, but like everything, it must be balanced.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another note, I realized recently that i have the option to start dating again if i so choose.&nbsp; In fact, I have several options recently it seems.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I just really don't feel like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tired of just killing time with people whose company i enjoy, but don't feel any real connection with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to feel&nbsp;inspired.&nbsp; Life is too short to spend with people who aren't passionate about whatever it is they are into.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be nice to have some&nbsp;company -&nbsp;Paul is in&nbsp;Rhode Island for a month and its just me and the dog in this big new house...&nbsp; In truth though, my mind is elsewhere; and anytime i think about dating,&nbsp;another comes unbidden to my mind.&nbsp; I think Nobi and i will keep to ourselves for the moment.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three days in a row off next week, so I'm going camping.&nbsp; Thinking about camping on one of the barrier islands for a couple days, weather permitting.&nbsp; Next moth I am driving down to Tampa FL for my brother's 40 BIRTHDAY PARTY!&nbsp; FORTY!&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; I remember when my parents were forty!&nbsp; Anyway, I'm thinking that while I am down there, I'll take a couple extra days and float to Cocoa FL where I here there is a Zen temple in the Soto lineage.&nbsp; Maybe do some kayaking before I come back as well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest project recently is trying to plan an extended trip to a Zen monastery sometime soon (hopefully before the end of the year.)&nbsp; There are a handful in the States, but none are close by.&nbsp; The most famous is at Shasta Mt. In California, but there is also one close to Portland that I'm leaning towards - I've always wanted to see Portland anyway.&nbsp; I wonder who I could sucker into making the trip with me...&nbsp;

      Aaaaahhhhh - finally!  Home internet access!  Back to spending the wee small hours of the night in the warm blue glow.  At least i wont have to keep going to the library now every time i want to check my email. What a great night i had last night!  I went to  urlLink the Thirsty Hippo  for open mic night.  I hadn't realized how much i missed that place or the whole scene up here.  I saw lots of people i used to play with or go hear back when Mugshots used to have open mic in my last tour of duty in the burg.  Even a couple people i didn't know came up to me and asked if i was that guy who used to play all the irish stuff and play with Gary back then.  Sitting at a table in the back in the smoky dark room with a Guinness and listening to familiar people and faces, i felt like i was back where i should be.  It was surr4eal and beautiful.  No dount i will be found up there every week now.  I'm going to do my best to get Joe to come play next week.  I will say that the quality of musicians up here has gotten much much better since the last time i was around.  A couple were really impressive.  I enjoyed watching everyone, but now i can't wait to go back and play myself next week.

      Well, I am succesfully moved into the new digs.  Going to get Kenobi tommorrow - Paul and i have been cleaning for the last three days and are just now ready to start unpacking (the last tenant didn't leave the place in the best condition.)  It's nice to be back in Hattiesburg amid the familiar.  Good to be around what's left of the old crew again.  Not making the most money i've ver made at work, but the people i work with are nice enough, and it's a cool enough job to get me through the rest of the summer and into my full time school in a month or so.  Feels good to be putting my life in order to finish my masters et all.  Back into training again after a 1-2 month hiatus.  I actually have been enjoying cleaning the house the last few days.  Its good to get your hands dirty in hard work every once in a while.  And i like thinking about the process - removing the layers of dirt and use and not that clean history to make something new and usefulll and clean again.  I can certainly think of other things i would rather be doing, but i enjoy living the metaphor.

      Time for the weekly Wednesday night open mic night at the Thirsty Hippo update.  It was nice to hang out with friends tonight.  Comforting.  Some of the crew that plays on open mic night at the Hippo are so good - I wish i had a recording of some of the songs they play.  My boy Justin for example has one "There aint much left in the Bottle to Spin."  Amen brother.  Amen. The biggest difference tonight was that i played as well.  I have not since i've been back.  That experience is always is so nerve racking, no matter how many times you do it.  I will always applaud anyone who plays something even if they totally suck - because its hard enough just to have the balls to get up there and do it.  I played a tweeked version of a Pogues song, an old folk tune, and a song by Grant Lee Buffalo called "Honey Don't Think."  I had been saving that for a very specific audience, but it has been on my mind of late, and i probably wont ever have the opportunity anyway.  Maybe it was theraputic for me.  Maybe it just faned the flames higher.  Not that they needed help.  At any rate, I love that smoky beery hole in the wall - even if it is filled with memories that sometimes hurt. Going to New Orleans in a couple days to visit old friends and new friends.  That's uplifting.  The world is full of people with things to offer you on your path, and i find that for the most part, the timing in which you cross paths is not a coincidence.  Next week i have 3 days in a row off, and i want to spend them hiking some forgotten stretch of nowhere with Nobi.  Maybe Sipsey wilderness in AL...

      One thing i direct a good deal of effort towards is trying to live fully aware of each moment. So much of our lives we spend daydreaming or fantasizing... investing energy in our worries or our hopes instead of just being. To let go of the way you want things to be (or not be) and just existing in the moment with no expectation - just awareness - is a dificult thing indeed. I believe it is possible only to the degree that the mind is quiet. I am reminded now of why that is so. It is so much more difficult to be only in this moment when hopes or fears creep into your life. Once you beging hoping for something, it is so easy to start fearing other things. The loss of that hope, for example. Your fear creates doubts, your doubts create worry. You find yourslef in daydreams and expectations. All of this can happen without you even really being consciously aware of it. And all of it is an impediment to living in the moment you are in alone, without expectation. I am reminded of a story - One day, a man recieved a knock on his door. When he opened it, there stood before him the most beautiful, enchanting lady he had ever seen. He imediately invited her in and asked her name. She said "I am Lady Luck. Wherever I go, happiness and goodfortune abound - joy and wealth increase." The man of course, was overjoyed and invited her to stay with him permanently. As soon as he did this, however, there came another knock on the door. When the man opened it, he saw a twisted, dirty, ugly old hag on his doorstep. The man demanded to know who she was and what she wanted. She said "I am Misfortune. Wherever I go, disaster, misery and wo follow. Unhappiness and bad luck come with me." Of course the man immediately tells her to leave his site and never return. But the Lady Luck stopped him, saying. "As long as i remain, she must stay as well, for wherever i go, she inevitably follows." Understanding at last, the man drove them both from his house. When good fortune comes, it is great. But i think it is important to recieve that good fortune with equanimity - just as one would recieve calamity. To recieve the good fortune, but set no store by it - to recieve it without expectation. Because as soon as you identify with that good fortune and let it become bound up with the day to day you - you will fear its loss, and the cycle starts. I see now that my resolve to remain without expectation is going to be much harder to keep than i thought. I have been so happy and excited about things recently - and it is oh so easy to slip into daydreams and fantasy lands... It will be harder than i thought, but i remain commited. Awareness of the reality of things - letting evemts progress on their own with a clear and open mind without expectation - will produce greater things than my day dreams ever could.

      Life is a position of time, and death is a position of time . . . just like winter and spring. You must not believe that winter becomes spring - nor can you say that spring becomes summer. When a man gains perspective, it is like the moon reflecting on water: the moon does not be-come wet, nor is the water ruffled. Even though the moon gives immense and far-reaching light, it is reflected in a puddle of water. The full moon and the entire sky are reflected in a dewdrop on the grass. Just as perspective does not hinder man, the moon does not hinder the water. -dogen
