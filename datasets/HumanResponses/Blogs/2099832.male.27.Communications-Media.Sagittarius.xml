      Have you seen the keeper of lists site yet? This place is hilarious... and not intended for the prudish or easily offended. This site is like David Letterman's Top10 Lists when taken as far as it could possibly go. P   We've been passing these links back and forth around the office for weeks. Some of my favorite lists are:   urlLink Top 46 Rejected Dr. Seuss Books   urlLink Top 27 Pointless Software Application Features   urlLink Top 69 Things A Real Man Would Never Say   urlLink Top 39 Bumper Stickers for the Presidential Motorcade   Enjoy!

         JeffMacIntyre.com  Well,  urlLink Jeffie is writing again  (cheer!) and has a couple new blog posts up.  However, I like this post from the peanut gallery the best. :)   You are starting to sound like the automated "phone-lady" at Telus. "We're all really busy right now, but if you'll just hang on a little longer...." Nobody gives a shit about the day job JP. Entertain me dammit!  Posted by Big Brother at October 21, 2003 08:30 AM      AListApart.com  Zeldman and Co. have  urlLink re-launched AListApart.com  with a new look and new content. I fear I'm in the minority on this one but I don't really like the new design... it's just nice to have the site back up though. Good work guys.   BurnKit.com  Best known for their tragically hip bible design, off-da-hook anniversary parties, and hedonistic road trips... JSHDNFRD and and Adam Neilson have added another supa-star artist to their design team...  urlLink Jeremy Crowle . Check out his profile and design portfolio.

      When I'm hanging out online I love to watch TV in a little window on my screen in parallel with whatever else I'm doing. One of my favorite sites is PBS:Frontline. They have like about 25 full-length documentaries available to view online.... 1-2 hours each broken up into 4-6 segments. They just released 2 new ones this week.   urlLink  Truth, War, and Consequences      Did America rush into a war in Iraq for which it was unprepared? Could the current volatility in Iraq have been prevented? And was the White House's rationale for war based on faulty and exaggerated intelligence reports?      urlLink Chasing the Sleeper Cell      "In the past 24 hours, federal authorities have identified, investigated and disrupted an Al Qaeda-trained terrorist cell on American soil," Deputy Assistant Attorney General Larry Thompson announced on Sept. 14, 2002. It was a sobering announcement that sent shockwaves through America.

      New York Times Magazine published a great new in-depth look inside life and legacy of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il.  A few paragraphs are pasted below... but the  urlLink full text  is definitely worth a read. It sounds like we're going to be hearing lots more  Dear Leader  in next couple years.   urlLink    The Dear Leader is a workaholic. Kim Jong Il sleeps four hours a night, or if he works through the night, as he sometimes does, he sleeps four hours a day. His office is a hive of activity; reports cross his desk at all hours. Dressed as always in his signature khaki jumpsuit, he reads them all, issuing instructions to aides, dashing off handwritten notes or picking up the phone at 3 a.m. and telling subordinates what should lead the news broadcasts or whom to dispatch to a prison camp. His micromanaging style is less Caligula, with whom he has often been compared, and more Jimmy Carter on an authoritarian tear.    The Dear Leader, as the North Korean media refer to him, wishes to be viewed as a modern leader. He has boasted to visitors that he has three computers in his office, though it's not known if he operates them himself or has aides who do so. His eldest son is reputed to be a computer whiz and, like sons the world over, is credited with bringing his father into the digital age. When Madeleine K. Albright, then the secretary of state, visited North Korea in 2000, Kim asked her, as he said farewell, to give him the State Department's e-mail address.   Because of weakening eyesight, the Dear Leader rarely reads newspapers; for keeping abreast of world affairs, he relies on television. It is a safe bet that he is well aware of the uproar caused by his government's confirmation, earlier this month, that it has begun making nuclear bombs from reprocessed plutonium. In a meeting a few years ago with a group of South Korean media executives, Kim explained that he began watching South Korean television in 1979. A media junkie, he also watches NHK from Japan, as well as CCTV from China and CNN. Having led his nation into chronic poverty and famine, what does he make of the enormous wealth he sees in the broadcasts and commercials?   urlLink Full Text >>

       The latest version of OS X from  urlLink Apple  is scheduled to be available on October 24th. O'Reilly Network has published  urlLink a review  of the hot new Mac operating system code-named Panther. The review touches on 10 interesting new features and upgrades, including;   1. Exposé, 2. Command-Tab, 3. Threading in Mail, 4. Fast Preview, 5. The New Finder, 6. Safari Rendering, 7. Font Book, 8. File Vault, 9. Secure Erase Trash, 10. Active Directory Integration.  I'm looking forward to giving it a whirl.  urlLink Cheetah  was horrible,  urlLink Puma  at least got me up on Office,  urlLink Jaguar  was pretty tight but Apple's users are looking to be reinspired. Hopefully  urlLink Panther  can do it.  Rawr!

      Ok ok.. so I spent the weekend at  urlLink GreenFestival  in San Francisco...    urlLink The Green Festival , co-produced by  urlLink Global Exchange  and  urlLink Co-op America , brings together green enterprises, environmental groups, leading thinkers on the green economy, and thousands of attendees for a two-day party with a very serious objective: strenghtening the locally controlled, green economy and expanding popular support for policies aimed at sustainability and social justice.   I came away with a new perspective on my personal power to influence change and the feeling that I can make a difference.  Today's Shout-Outs go to some of my favorite speakers from the event...    urlLink Jim Hightower   - National radio commentator, writer, public speaker, and author of  urlLink Thieves In High Places: They've Stolen Our Country And It's Time to Take It Back , Jim Hightower has spent three decades battling the Powers That Be on behalf of the Powers That Ought To Be - consumers, working families, environmentalists, small businesses, and just-plain-folks.    urlLink Peter Camejo   - Peter Miguel Camejo (63) is a first generation Venezuelan-American who has fought for social and environmental justice since his teens. Peter is chair and co-founder of Progressive Asset Management, Inc., a broker-dealer firm which promotes socially responsible investments.  He created the Eco-Logical Trust for Merrill Lynch, the first environmentally screened fund of a major firm, and a top performer. He served three years as trustee of the Contra Costa County Employees Retirement Association. He has also been appointed by the Lt. Governor of Hawaii to be an advisor to the Hawaii Capital Stewardship Forum.    urlLink Annita Roddick   - Out in the real world, beyond the radar screens of the media and political classes - something is massing. Something bigger than most of us have yet realized - something that is beginning to look likes a genuine global revolution. One that aims at turning on its head the existing power structure, millions strong. A revolution where ideas have wings. Anita Roddick will explore how this movement is taking shape in various countries - including in the Slow Food Movement in Europe, creative and joyful dissent in the streets of America, anti-globalisation actions in India and Africa. Roddick will discuss how business can be part of creative solutions to the problems of globalisation instead of part of the problem.

      Well, I finally saw return of the king last night. I thought it  was (predictably) great, and I (predictably) kicked myself for having not seeing it on the big screen. I'll probably watch it again tonight so I can see all the parts I missed while Melissa was chatting, cheering, crying etc.     Tonight when I watch it though I'm going to drink... and from the looks of things heavily. Tim and I made up a few rules to a Lord of the Rings drinking game today during lunch time. Let me know the results if you end up trying it out yourself. Use the comments feature on this site to suggest/add your own rules too.   Every time someone falls off a cliff... take a drink  Every time  urlLink Sam  cries... take a drink  Every time a close-up of  urlLink Frodo's  eyes takes up more than 50% of the screen... take a drink  Every time you mistake  urlLink the (male) elf  briefly for a hot blonde chick... take a drink (NOTE: your ability to distinguish between the two is sure to diminish the longer you play this game, making this particular rule a very slippery slope)   Trying watching all three  urlLink The Lord of the Rings  movies...  urlLink The Fellowship of the Ring ,  urlLink The Two Towers , and  urlLink The Return of the King ... sequentially while playing this game and you have a whole weekend full of entertainment right there!

      From time to time inevitably everyone has to justify their existence within a corporation. "What do you do exactly?" "What value do you provide the organization?" "What impact would it have on 'us' if 'we' didn't have 'you'?"      When it comes to design, measuring quantifiable value can be difficult and we are often forced to use more qualitative metrics to measure the value that good aesthetics and proper design brings to a company.   In the past couple days I've found a couple good resources that attempt to illustrate in quantifiable terms the impact of design on an enterprise. The net net of both is a conclusion that most of us who work in the applied arts field already know... companies that are design-driven outperform those that are not. Now bring on the charts and figures!    urlLink Impact of Design on Stock Market Performance   -  The Design Council  The design council has produced an excellent research report documenting the valuation of companies considered to be 'design-driven' vis-a-vis those that are not over a period of 10 years. A great test in terms a CFO can understand. Over time what is the tangible effect of design on a company and it's shareholders  The results? Design driven companies outperform the market by 200%!   "Companies recognized as effective users of design strongly outperform their peers on the stock market - that is the key finding of a ground-breaking study which has tracked a total of 166 design-led companies over ten years of UK share price activity.   A group of 63 companies, grouped into a 'Design Portfolio' for their consistent showing in various design award schemes, outperformed both the FTSE All Share and FTSE 100 indices by around 200% between 1994 and 2003, the study reveals."      urlLink The Power of Design   -  Business Week  A great feature on design house IDEO and some case studies on how they have made their clients money through good design and design process.

      This is not a politcal blog or activism website. I don't have an agenda, but I do have a problem with the way we are running our international affairs. Specifically, I think we are loosing the war in Iraq.      America hasn't made friends of the Iraqi people.  In the poll, 80 percent of the Iraqis questioned reported a lack of confidence in the Coalition Provisional Authority, and 82 percent said they disapprove of the U.S. and allied militaries in Iraq. ( urlLink Salt Lake Tribune , May 13)   Bremer, and the Iraqi Governing Council have failed and their jobs will be turned over to the UN if it's a mission they choose to accept.  "We sit in the council while the country is burning and argue over procedure,'' says Sheikh Yawar, a Sunni tribal leader who lived abroad until last year. "We're like the Byzantines in Constantinople, debating whether angels are male or female with the barbarians at the gate." Under Mr. Brahimi's plan for a transitional government, all 25 members of the US-appointed council would be culled in favor of a team of technocrats to be chosen next month by Brahimi's team and influential Iraqis, with US input. The group would take power in July and shepherd Iraq to elections next January - in which, ideally, they would not participate. ( urlLink Christian Science Monitor , May 13)   The coalition is a sham and is falling apart.  Spainish Troops Leaving ( urlLink Yahoo!,  April 19) Poland Pulling Out ( urlLink Irish Times , April 20) Honduras Pulls Troops ( urlLink CNN , April 19) Nicaragua Done ( urlLink Reuters , April 20) Ukraine Pulls Back ( urlLink MSNBC , April 21) Dominican Republic Removes Troops ( urlLink CBS , April 20)   The war is expensive, bloody, and indefinite.  The official, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, acknowledged that a surge of violence and other problems in Iraq had led to rising costs, with no certainty yet when they would fall. ( urlLink NY Times, May 13 )   The world is less safe than it was before we started, and there are more terrorists now than ever.  The AP-Ipsos poll, released Wednesday at The Associated Press annual meeting, found: Half feel that, in some measure, the terrorists might be winning the war on terrorism. One in five in the poll feels strongly the terrorists are winning while an additional 30 percent say there is at least “a little truth” to that statement. More than one-third say they have less faith in government’s ability to protect them, and an additional one-fourth say there’s at least some truth to that idea. Nearly half feel strongly they are more pessimistic about the possibility of there ever being peace in the world while an additional one-fourth say there may be some truth to that. ( urlLink MSNBC , April 22)      More than 50% of America's troops are deployed, reservists tours are extended again, and the military is stretched thin.  The US has committed most of its heavy ground forces and deployable aircraft carriers, as well as a large share of its best attack aircraft and air- and sea-lift units. ( urlLink Washington Post , April 8) The newly announced troop extensions — which broke the Pentagon's promise that Iraq tours of duty would be limited to one year — are forcing many to change plans, cancel weddings and delay return to normal life. Meanwhile, the anxiety felt by those at home increases each day. ( urlLink ABS News , April 23)    America has failed to uncover the weapons that led us into this war.  During the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner this week, Bush presented a slide show of quirky photographs from inside the White House. In one, the president is looking under furniture in the Oval Office. "Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere," Bush joked. "Nope, no weapons over there ... maybe under here?"

       urlLink Google  launched a cool new service called  urlLink Gmail . I've landed a beta account and it seems pretty hot. You get 1000megs of space vs. MSN Hotmails 2megs making it an actually useful mailbox. It's pretty interesting how it turns back and forth barrage of short emails into threads or 'conversations'. It also takes advantage of Google search technology to keep my email life organized. I've set up my  urlLink kk@burnkit.com  address to forward there. Gmail would be really cool though if you could POP several accounts like you can over at Hotmail where I had been popping my old  urlLink TWU  mail, my  urlLink Burnkit  mail, and my groovy.com mail. Anyway, I'm hooked. Checked it out when it becomes generally available.  I've also been expiramenting with this other online networking tool called  urlLink LinkedIn . I got turned onto it from a good friend,  urlLink Ean Jackson , in  urlLink Vancouver  who always seems to be on the cutting edge of this type of thing... he got me up and running on  urlLink Plaxo  too. It kinda seems like  urlLink Friendster  but for business contacts. You upload information about yourself and your professional experience and jobs you've held. People who have worked with you in the past can write testimonials or references. It's kinda fun to mess with and a good way to 'practice' marketing oneself, but I'm still skeptical that I'll get any good job leads or new contacts from it... we'll see. Lemme know if any of you guys sign up and I'll write you up a little reference and beg you for one for me as well. :P Here's my  urlLink work-in-progress page .

I don't really snowboard, but look how cute I am in this furry vest! Besides, snowboarders have all the good weed hook-ups. -  urlLink xxx       Exotic beauty wants someone who can love me for me- I'm slightly crazy, so I'm down with pretty much anything. Drugs? OK. Your friends want to watch? That's OK too. Please, no more lonely nights sprawled across the piano, singing Fiona Apple covers, and getting drunk alone. -  urlLink xxx       Runaway from Ohio, hoping to make it big in Hollywood. You may have seen me hanging out in the parking lots of places where famous people go, hoping to trade blow jobs for a walk-on part in Malcolm In The Middle. I'm willing to do whatever it takes because, let's face it, I can barely read and don't know how to use a computer so in a couple months I'll be doing porn anyway. -  urlLink xxx      Former Survivor castaway, turned topless model / reporter for Wild On... enjoys getting drunk and making bad decisions. I'm looking for the type of guy who pages me 20 times a day, and starts fights with anyone who stares at me. I have no tan lines, or hangups about doing it on film. -  urlLink xxx      The little blogger girl. Cheerleader, honors student, and I'm in a band! I tell my parents I'm a virgin, but the truth is I sneak out at nights to party with cholos, and the secrets to my good grades are diet pills, and having given a handjob to the vice principal. -  urlLink xxx      Once upon a time, I was a young girl who wanted to be a nurse. Now I'm the star of Nurse Nellie Takes It Up The Ass, Part Five. It's funny how dreams come true... sort of. -  urlLink xxx

       urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     I spent this weekend and Monday lounging around the Northern California coastline with my best friend  urlLink Donald . He and I have been buddies since we were about 7 years old and played on a kiddie soccer team together.  He's in WAY better shape than my sorry ass and he totally ran circles around me on the trails and stuff, but it felt great to be outdoors and active and with good company.  We hiked, camped, played chess, threw rocks, BBQ'd, drank beer, and snuck into the Smith River Yacht Club to catch the Game 1 of the NBA playoffs. It was totally relaxing and we saw a lot of great stuff. I'm feeling inspired to get back into shape and do it more often. Donald, want to move to Vancouver with me?

         When I was growing up my Dad used to tell me a little bit about my grandfather being 'an inventor'. I've always had an interest in building and designing things so the idea of him being an inventor has always excited me and made me really proud even though it wasn't very tangible to me.  He invented a device for manually pumping liquid petroleum. It's commonly used on small farms to move things like propane from their main tank to smaller vehicle based tanks. It also turns out that 58 years and several owners later,  urlLink the company  (that still bears his name) is still very relevant and  urlLink the pump he invented  continues to be their strongest product. Over the years, sales shifted from domestic US to international where there are so many areas that do not have electricity and LP gas is still pumped by hand. My dad told me that he remembers even back 30 years ago that his dad was surprised the product was still as popular as it was.     Recently the company upgraded their website which is how I tracked them down. Maybe they'll let me do their logo next as a little pro bono work. :)

         The trailer for Michael Moore's film is  urlLink now online . The film recently won the Palme D'or at the Cannes film festival and examines what happened to the United States after September 11; and how the Bush Administration used the tragic event to push its agenda. After debuting at Cannes in May, they've now signed deals with Lions Gate Films (based in Vancouver) to distribute the film in North America and it will be opening in theatres on June 25th.

      I've been told I'm hard to shop for. I've never been able to figure this out... 'cause to me it feels more like I want *everything*. I think the real problem is that the people buying me stuff don't approve of getting me the things I like/want. Regardless, I've put together a  urlLink Wish List  over at  urlLink Amazon.com . I'll keep it up to date so why not head on over there now and buy me stuff. Thx to  urlLink Ritchie  for the tip.

       (interview originally published at  urlLink UrbanVancouver.com )   Jeremy Crowle is an up-and-coming Canadian painter, illustrator, photographer, and all-purpose lunatic. I recently had the chance to interview him and we got to talking about art, politics, environmental sustainability, and relationships. He currently works at a  urlLink Vancouver graphic design studio  and his work can be seen at the  urlLink Alibi Room  in Vancouver starting August 22, 2004 or online at  urlLink Fragile Lifestyle .      kk001 - We’ve seen you shoot photos, paint with oils, draw, build websites, design typefaces, and write on trains and walls, among other things. Tell me about your progression as an artist. Did you go to art school? What is your inspiration?   I went to a high school that really promoted the arts and  had a great instructor. My folks have always been really supportive, as well, encouraging me to do [art] as much as I can. Aside from that, I went to art college for a week before I decided it wasn't for me. It’s a great resource and there were some amazing, talented people who I met there, but my focus has always been a bit more grass roots. I've spent a lot of time learning [by myself] and from other artists I know on more of a progressive, intimate level.   My inspiration has always been the people around me, and I evolve as an artist naturally, I think—as we do physically. I started painting graffiti when I was 14, and became interested in graphic design after the paintings I was doing began taking on a really graphic look. I had first applied that with spray paint. It seems like any art form I try influences the rest of them.     kk002 - What is your favorite medium? How do these different media interact for you as an artist?   I think over the years I’ve grown to understand how a marketable form of art directly influences its environment. All forms of art are marketable to a degree, but the least adaptable to the media, I think, is where I fit perfectly. I don’t think it’s the medium, specifically, that gets me going; it’s the message.   I believe—and I’ve said this before— that a medium—whether it be a paintbrush, a computer, or spray can—is just another kind of hammer you beat the nail into the wood with. It’s really about how you use the medium – especially these days when a message may be more relevant to its audience than a medium. Of course, then you have to address the fact that some may come specifically to see “that” medium and, in some ways, you have to cater to that if you want your point to be taken.   A medium, to me, is just a way to reach a different group with the same message—or possibly choosing a medium that would more definitely communicate something than another medium would. Having said all that, I think my guitar is the best medium for me, because I know the least about it.    kk003 - How do you see the difference between the projects you'd categorize as applied art versus those you'd consider fine art?   The only difference to me is the criteria. Fine art is based (most of the time) on my own criteria, where most design (applied art) needs to address the client’s needs or vision.   In some ways, you need to think about response in all cases; but fine art is definitely more open- ended. There’s much more room for someone to react after having applied a twist of their own imagination or perspective, whereas design on a marketing scale is often really specific to the product. Fine art is used within media, but I think it really has a life and purpose of its own.      kk004 - You've had some commercial success with your paintings in Europe. Tell me about that. Who collects your work? How were they exposed to you?   I’ve has some really strange experiences in the past with the work I’ve done there. Some punk bands were really into some portraits I’d done. I had taken a photograph of myself in the men's room at the Gallery of Modern Art  in Glasgow, sent it to [the gallery] a week later, and heard from a friend they’d hung it.   It was shortly after a visit to Ireland that I had received interest in some other paintings from a gallery, and it started there. Years ago I had met a girl from London – a relative of a friend here— and did a group of portraits of her in a photo booth.   Those paintings did really well and sort of started the whole theme of relationship for me. That theme has obviously evolved into more specific categories, but, for the most part, still embraces that sense of randomness in personal observation. Recently, I’ve been involved with a group in Italy, and some work has been commissioned, but, for the most part, it seems to be word of mouth or pure luck that sells paintings for me.    kk005 - Do you consider yourself political? How does that manifest itself in your work?   I definitely think there is political context in the work I do, but I am often quite bored with the redundancy of government. It’s a whole lot of drama and half the time the things we hear are not the things that matter most. Even if they had a wrap on things, the majority of the public within that government doesn’t get to hear about it, or [is] conditioned not to care.  Maybe that’s a bit harsh. There are a lot of things in government that have a great potential to influence the way we represent our country, but I think a country that says represent us before you represent yourself is total shit.   A lot of people find a sense of identity in patriotism or in political movements, and that’s good. But I think the real government is not really here to help us know that; its here to offer whatever order it can muster. That’s its job.     Recently, I have been overcome with a desire to talk about environmental sustainability with my work. I think the next step to interacting with the environment you see  as an individual  is to respect yourself as a part of it. That knowledge really influences the way you approach communication—not to mention lifestyle.   I think any political relevance I have as an artist is to inform people that they are still people. They can still make choices—whether it’s voting, or choosing a better loaf of bread. I think we need to be concerned with the lifestyle we choose before we apply that choice to a population of humans around us. On an organized level, there are groups I support like  urlLink Market Trade Fair  or  urlLink Doctors Without Borders .     kk006 - What's the concept behind Fragile Lifestyle? Do you live a fragile lifestyle?   This week has been somewhat fragile (laugh) ... The concept of fragile lifestyle is about relationship. On a large scale, it comes back to the individual, but there is a bit of vulnerability in genuine, honest interaction and you see a lot of people guard themselves from that. I try my hardest to offer a genuine response to anything I see.    kk007 - How do you balance being creative at your day job as a designer with the creativity expressed in the rest of your life as an artist? Do you feel like you use your best ideas at work? Do you ever feel that you are “used up” when you try produce paintings on your own time? Or does work and being around other creative people inspire you more?      It’s hard to compare the two because there is such a dramatic difference between the concept of fine art and design for me. I think my job helps me find more obscure ways of communicating an idea while maintaining a little legibility. But creativity is part of my lifestyle and it keeps me on point, I guess.  It’s the execution of an idea that makes it original, and I feel bringing that balance to  urlLink Burnkit’s  table helps the creative flow in our office. The guys here are really good. We’re a great team who lend skills to each other in an unusually fluid way and I’m inspired by how we communicate about our work internally. Painting is more of a voice; design is a resource. In terms of incentive, my day job motivates me to raise the stakes at the studio and visa versa.     kk008 - Are you currently painting? What are you working on?   I recently took a trip to Alaska, visiting a friend who was working there. About halfway into the trip, I got really inspired to change my thinking about the arts. She-my friend—introduced me to a new world of political issues, as well as deepening my interest in the environment. I am currently working on a series of drawings that explain our relationship with a completely natural habitat, from a totally urban perspective.       kk009 - Tell me  urlLink 'the two things'  about Jeremy Crowle.   1. love everything you do 2. love everything you don’t do    Minutia: At the moment, what is you favorite...   RGB color: 100% green Spray paint color: Montana Gold raspberry Photoshop tool: the clone stamp Software application: MSN Messenger Hip-hop album: ATLien Author/writer: Stan Allen Designer: Adam Neilson Physical activity: walking Website:  urlLink http://tunneling.irational.org/cgi-bin/tunneling.pl  Video game: Siren Clothing color: white Food/Restaurant: grilled cheese sandwich and the Alibi Room Beer: Raven Cream Ale Movie/DVD/Show: The Blind Swordsman Fictional character: Jesus Quotation: “You are the company you keep” Artist: Chuck Close Place to hang out: The Trestle Other: Alysha said she was meeting me for lunch today

      Hey tough-guy! Not hardcore? Want to pretend you are so you fit in at Burning Man? Maybe you want to get inked, but are scared it will hurt. Or you like the idea of tattoos but don't know what you want to get. Maybe you're afraid of catching Hep C from the tattoo needle. Well  urlLink Sleeves Clothing  is the product for you. Nude colored, translucent tshirts with prefabbed popular tattoo designs already printed on them. Full sleeves in just 30 seconds. Choose from gangsta, biker, tribal, and Japanese. *eye roll*     Ha.. for those of you who don't know me well or can't pick up on my sarcasm, I think this is a lame idea. I understand the whole idea of getting tattooed as being an act of personal expression and a form of counter-cultural art. Anyway, the concept of these shirts seems to fly in the face of everything I've always understood body work to be. How embarrassing would it be to show up at a hot party or concert with brand new fake tatts only to found out 3 other people bought the same shirt and have the same tatts. Safe, user-friendly, sterile, un-artistic tattoo shirts for the masses. Heh... these guys will probably make a million bucks and they make me want to rethink my plans to get some more work done this summer. :(   PS. If you see a guy wearing a shirt like this at the club, chances are he's probably stuffing socks down the front of his pants too to make it look like he's got more than he actually does. I think this product will appeal to the same type of person.

       urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Check out this series of QuickTime videos by Eman Laerton. This guy is too funny. He goes around to concert parking lots and tells fans that the bands they like are inauthentic, fake, and just plain suck. He stands up with a soapbox and bull-horn and tries to reform the fans of what he considers bad music with his public service announcements. His message is simple. Don't go to this concert. Stop listening to bad music. Turn off your radio and tv.  After getting a crowd of partying Linkin Park fans to dance and chant "Linkin Park is a roller-coaster" he proceeds to tell them that like a roller coaster Linkin park may seem dangerous or appear rebellious while in fact it's perfectly safe for family fun, the danger is an illusion, and they've been duped by marketing hype. He goes farther claiming the lead singer writes in fictionalized cliches and calling him fraudulent.  I would love to go see this guy do his act at one of these upcoming shows in LA  urlLink posted on his website .

         Lots of you are probably already involved and helping out, but for those of you who aren't, we're in the process of breathing some life back into  urlLink *spark-online . We're really early in the game so far, but here are a couple highlights.  +  urlLink We've selected WordPress as our publishing platform.  +  urlLink We've begun to port the archived articles from their old format into WordPress.  +  urlLink We've not spent ANY time on design yet. That will come later . +  urlLink We're trying to figure out how often to publish.   If you've been involved writing or editing for *spark-online in the past, and you're not involved already, just  urlLink drop by  and  urlLink create an account  and dive in. We'd love to have you and there is plenty of heavy lifting to be done before we can start publishing new content again.  Thanks to everyone who has been helped out so far. It's great to be collaborating with you guys again.

      A  urlLink great new article  posted today by  urlLink Design Council .   Design runs deeper than look and feel - it can help you decide what you do and how you do it.      What comes to mind when you think of design? Your last office makeover? Your business cards? Perhaps it's the artwork on the last book or record you bought. Or the last room you saw Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen change. Yes, these are all examples of design, but are you just identifying design as a superficial feature, employed purely for aesthetic reasons, rather than as a rigorous process. If you are, there could be more to design than meets the eye.  Businesses only really get the best out of design when they view it as something of core strategic importance rather than a coat of surface gloss. Think less about, say, the logo on your website's home page and more about why you have a website in the first place.  One of the best known examples of a business transformed by the strategic use of design is Apple Computer. The development of the i-Mac (the work of a team led by Briton Jonathan Ive), transformed Apple's fortunes in the consumer and education markets. A fine creative achievement but, just as importantly, also a great advert for the design-aware management culture, led by returning CEO Steve Jobs, which enabled that creativity. Remember too that it wasn't just about putting a brightly coloured shell around the same old computer, but about creating an improved user experience. Apple's design process embraced every single component and the entire manufacturing process. ( urlLink More @ Design Council )

      Cameron takes us through the development of his current site design. Good job articulating his  urlLink internal thought process .    urlLink Jason and half the frickin' internet discuss CSS, XHTML and standards . Again! This one is a good intro to the whole topic though and be very relevant to people considering trading in their tried and true old web development techniques for new ones.   urlLink Tomas Jogin totally geeks out  on heading hierarchy (title, h1, h2, etc) and document outline. urlLink Dave Shea jumps in . Reading this thread made me feel a lot like Jason does in  urlLink his post above this one . :P  Some great code for  urlLink lightweight, accessible CSS-based dropdown menus  from Son of Suckerfish.

      I have such great friends. Knowing that my company has recently been acquired and that likely that will mean the end of a job I've really enjoyed... my friends have started to rally and help me find a great new job. Here's one I received from someone who was very well intentioned, but must not have thought about how difficult and depressing the position could be.  Job title: Manager Marketing Communications North America  Name of company: ChevronTexaco  PR and Marcom for Chevron? Heh! Ya right.     What happens when another drunk boat captain crashes another tanker into an iceberg? I sure as hell have more important things in my life to deal with then helping a mega corporation save face in a situation like that. Or what happens when some African nation that company has been exploiting for it's resources rises up and kills all the American contractors working on the oil rig there. Can you imagine? No thx!  I really do appreciate the help guys. Don't get me wrong... keep the leads flowing. But, come on, anyone who knows me even a little bit well knows there isn't enough cash in the world to pay me to be the corporate mouth-piece for an organization like Chevron.

      I've been getting some questions about these topics lately and learning a lot about it myself, so I decided to put some information together in a post.  Do you like reading this site? Do you come here regularly? If so, you may want to consider using a news reader (aggregator) to receive updates from all the sites you follow in one central location.  For instance, I track about 150 (!) sites everyday using an Outlook plug-in called NewsGator. Essentially, when a blog or other site with an RSS feed is updated, the post or news item automatically pops into a folder in my Inbox and looks like new mail. A couple times a day I click through these folders and follow the links to the sites I'm tracking.  There are tons of news aggregators and I don't know which ones are better than which ones... my perception is that they're all pretty similar, but use my comments section to discuss if you disagree. The main reason I use NewsGator is that it plugs into Outlook and therefore fits into my work-flow.  Here is a list of links to news aggregation sites... they're all free... and I've included the link to syndicate my site via each one too. Have fun!   urlLink Add to Bloglines   urlLink Add to MyFeedster   urlLink Add to MyYahoo!   urlLink Burn this feed in FeedBurner   urlLink Subscribe in NetNewsWire   urlLink Subscribe in NewsGator Online Services   urlLink Subscribe in NewsMonster   urlLink Subscribe in SharpReader   urlLink Subscribe in Shrook   urlLink View at NewsIsFree   urlLink View at Syndic8   urlLink View at Technorati

       (interview originally published at  urlLink twohundredby200 magazine )   Michael C. Place was born in North Yorkshire, England in 1969. He graduated from Newcastle College in 1990. He then went on to work at Bite It!, London with Trevor Jackson working on mainly record covers for Champion Records, Gee Street Records for artists such as The Stereo MC's etc.  He started work at The Designers Republic, Sheffield in 1992 where he worked for 9 years, on a diverse range of work from R&S Records, Satoshi Tomiie, Warp Records, Sun Electric to the Wipeout series for the Playstation to the book 3D>2D Adventures In + Out of Architecture. He left tDR to go travelling in 2000. On September 17th, 2001 he started his own design company "Build", which is based in London. Build specialises mainly in design for print.  I recently had the chance to interview him for  urlLink twohundredby200 magazine . Here's the transcript of the interview.    KK001 - Tell me a little about your background... were you a creative little kid? Were you playing with shapes and color before you knew  designer  was a 'real job'?   I'm the son of a Farmer, and a Nurse, I was brought up in the rolling hills of North Yorkshire where I went to York College [graphic design] then up to Newcastle for my final 2 years studying graphic design [which I failed]. As a child I had always enjoyed drawing and from a very early age I wanted to be an Architect [I still have a strong interest in Architecture].    KK002 - How have you pushed yourself artistically and creatively? Have you been mentored and pulled forward or are you internally driven?   I've always just done my own thing, and have been fortunate to be able to explore my take on design throughout my career [first at Bite It!, then tDR]. I tend not to look/read design books, I prefer to get inspiration from less 'designed' objects.      KK003 - What do you see as the role of formal training and design education in the development of young designers? Do you continue to further your education in a formal way?    I think college for me was the natural thing to do [I graduated in 1990], the course I was on was geared to be very practical which I enjoyed, but at the same time I didn't want to be designing wine labels and nappie packaging. I wanted to design record covers, so I did a work placement at I-D magazine, then  urlLink The Designers Republic  I got on well at tDR and Ian later offered me a job.  I think that young designers in education should be given all the opportunities to take whatever path they want to take. The course I was on didn't really understand the whole 'sleeve design' thing and was more geared to advertising graphics. It was a constant struggle for me, I just used to do personal projects and scrape through the course work.  I would really like to do some part time lecturing; I think I would have something different to offer the students, that’s about it for my formal design education. I hope I have managed to keep my work at  urlLink Build  interesting, I love design and so I hope this shows in the work we produce.     KK004 - I've heard you say in the past, "The computer is a tool. Full stop." I also know you tend to focus primarily on print design. What is your relationship to technology and your computer and how do you    I still subscribe to that way of thinking. I love the whole process of design and don't want to get bogged down in the whole technical side of things. Print is great because it requires real discipline to do well, and I love the print process. I wouldn't like to be seen as a 'Jack of all trades'.  My relationship with my computer is simply this, I switch computer on, it works, the end. I was fortunate enough to be one of the last generation of designers that learned to do artwork by hand, using overlays, PMT cameras, making up type/colour etc.. This has helped me to have a really good knowledge of how the print process works. It's invaluable to me.    KK005 - What are you working on right now? Are there any techniques, themes or threads that are currently dominant in your design?   I have just completed my first motion piece, I'm working on a magazine redesign, just finished a Build edition for Refill Magazine, I'm working on a few corporate ID's, a book, 2 record sleeves etc. I'm getting into serif fonts at the moment [honest!] which is nice, I still enjoy designing fonts. I'm starting to use photography a bit more, taking my own pictures.    KK006 - What is a dream client to you?    My dream client is anyone who lets me do my thing... and has a large print budget! I have recently got an agent [This is Real Art]. They are really good and are helping me get bigger jobs. I think that the general public are a lot more design savvy and I believe that I can do the same level of creative work for an independent record label as I can for a multi-national corporation.    KK007 - Do you have formal or informal relationships with your clients?    I have different types of relationships with different clients. They range from the very informal [clients that have become friends etc.], to very formal [which is quite rare], due to the nature of the businesses that hire me to design for them they tend to be a bit more 'un-business-like' which suits me!      KK008 - Do you have a design business tip to share with other people trying to make it on their own?   My Build Design tip is to believe in yourself, try not to compromise the work you produce, in the end people will have more respect for you.    KK009 - How has the Build experience been? How has it differed from your time at The Designers Republic?   The Build experience has been the best thing I have ever done, I couldn't go back and work for someone else now. It's the best feeling. Build differs from The Designers Republic in a lot of ways, for one [and the best] it's my baby! tDR was great, Build is better!              KK010 - The  urlLink Computerlove International Graphic Design Exhibition  in Brussels was amazing. What did you do in your role as curator? Do you plan to do collaborative exhibitions like this again in the future?    Thanks. I really enjoyed doing that with the Computerlove crew, they are such a brilliant people to work with, so much enthusiasm for the design community [I have made some good friends from my involvement with that project]. My role was to design the identity/feel of the space, and as guest artist. I feel very proud of this exhibition, it was the first time that I was asked to exhibit our work as Build so it will always have a special place in my heart.  I would love to do something similar for someone else, I enjoyed designing for a space rather that for an area of paper, it throws up it's own challenges and presents itself with some interesting opportunities.    KK011 - Do you see yourself walking a fine line between 'fine artist' and 'applied artists'? If so which side of that line would you say you are on?   I would say that I am on the side of the 'applied artist', I never lose sight of the fact that I am designing 'for someone', that's the bottom line. As I said before I have been very fortunate to have the clients I have, who have been kind enough to let me loose on their products.     KK012 - Tell me  urlLink Two Things  about Michael Place.   The Two Things about Michael C. Place: 1) I would like to open a shop that sells only Crisps [Chips, from around the World], the shop is called 'Crisp'.  2) The 'C' stands for Christopher.    ***Minutia: At the moment, what's your favorite...
