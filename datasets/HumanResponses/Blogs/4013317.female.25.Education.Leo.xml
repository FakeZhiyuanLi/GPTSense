      Today's the big day -- so why, you might wonder, am I wasting time posting?  Good question.  It turns out that even if you get the very first appointment at 7:30am on a Saturday morning, the movers can *still* be late.  The irony is that I called the guy at around 7:00am to confirm that he was coming and he said, "Yes, m'am!"  I thought, "Wow, this guy's got his act together."  10 minutes later he calls and says, "I'm running about 20 minutes late."  So I sit here in my soon-to-be-old room on my soon-to-be-old bed with my unplugged air conditioner (extension cord is packed) waiting.

      I feel the need to post, but I have little of value to say.  This is probably directly related to procrastinating the packing I should be doing.  Damn.  Now I'm only left with going to the Post Office and picking up a change-of-address card and then I'll be stuck with either packing or homework.  Shoot me now.  In case you're in the area, we'll be celebrating birthday festivities at Caliente Cab Company on Waverly Place at 8pm on Saturday.  If you're not, I'll drink a margarita for you- frozen with salt.

      Today I learned that, according to the NY Post, 31% of the Class of 2003 dropped out of high school.  Nearly 1 out of every 3 kids dropped out.  How did that not make front page news of The New York Times?  I mean, at the very least, you'd think they'd be annoyed because it would potentially affect their future subscription purchases, no?   Otherwise, things have been moving along.  Apart from packing for the move and plowing through grad school crap, I've been doing a lot of reflecting.  Part of me keeps wondering what Webster, my stepfather, would think of what I'm doing with respect to this whole Teaching Fellow thing.  Would he think it's a waste of time, like my mom does, or would he feel like it's a valuable experience?  I feel like he'd probably humor me, think it's a phase, and assuage my mom's fears.  It's been 6 years since he died and it's amazing how much I still miss him.  Time doesn't heal all wounds- that's a bunch of crap.

      While I was sitting in my favorite coffeeshop, my best friend called. We talked for well over 3 hours.  There are few things better in the world to re-center me.  One of the few things that are better is the fact that she'll be within walking distance of me in less than a month.  I can't wait.  On the flip side, there are few things more annoying in the world than moving.  One of the few things is the fact that this is the second time I'm doing it in 4 months.  I keep hoping that I'll wake up one morning and all my things will be moved for me.  (Not stolen, mind you- just moved.)  I also get to couch-hop over the first two weeks in August until I can move into my new apartment on August 16.  Once grad school is over on August 11, I want to escape somewhere for several days... any suggestions?

      Yesterday I spent some quality time with Cap'n Morgan and his friends.  A couple of my current roommates and my new future roommate spent the evening out and about on the Upper East Side.  I watched the Red Sox lose to the Yankees and had to watch in disgust as the Yankee fans in the bar high fived each other.    Today I'll basically spend my day doing a lot of nothing and even more procrastinating of things I should really be doing.  Fun, fun.  Sun is on vacation for the weekend; Rain, however, is working overtime.

      As if the internet wasn't noisy enough...    Today I'm watching reruns and supposedly reading through stuff for a grad school presentation.  Did you know that there is actually an extended version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme song?  Exciting, eh?    Having a birthday on a Monday is a little disappointing.  Having my 25th on a Monday seems apropos: I should be old enough to be beyond the all-night craziness that is associated with birthdays 18 through 24.  Damn, and I will no longer be in the "ideal age demographic" for marketing agencies.  Well, crap, what good am I if they can't pitch me girly-smelling shaving cream?  Back to hiding from the big, fat raindrops outside.

      In 2 stops on the 4 train I saw:  - a man with a stub for a left arm and a 2-page sign that bullet-pointed his personal information and reasons why I should give him money (one reason was "I can't work");  -a teenager who was selling peanut M&Ms for $1 "not for no basketball team, but to keep money in my pocket";  -an older man who was "not too proud to accept food or a donation" and who apologized for interrupting our subway ride;  -a quiet, 20-something year-old girl with a baby in a blanket who needed some money to feed her family and to "fix some mistakes";  -a duo of drummers who didn't mean to interrupt, but would graciously accept any donation; and  -the ever-present Asian woman who wants to sell me 2 AA batteries, "kuurashi glue," or a blinking-light key chain for $1.  And that doesn't even begin to cover who I encountered above-ground...

      Some people have second homes in the Hamptons or on Cape Cod; I've more-or-less moved into a coffeeshop called DT/UT on the Upper East Side.  DT/UT, in case you're curious, stands for DownTown/UpTown -- clever, eh?    Anyway, I think I love this place because it is full of a few of my favorite things: 1)  Hazlenut coffee 2)  Brown sugar 3)  An Automated paper towel dispenser in the bathroom 4)  A rabid Red Sox fan as the coffee-bartender (who hooks me up with free coffee :)) 5)  Good music (Now playing: the Grease Soundtrack; was playing: The Cure) 6)  Free Wi-Fi access 7)  Comfy couches 8)  New and better distractions from doing the schoolwork I should be doing.  :)

       I can think of quite a few occasions when   urlLink  this    would have been useful... I know it's disturbing, but it's still amusing.    Oh, by the way, I'll be teaching at a  urlLink new school  next year. I'll be teaching the same population and the same grade (darling Freshmen), but it's a brand-new school with a focus on Engineering and Technology. The principal is someone I respect and he made me feel very wanted at the school. I'll be one of two English teachers on staff, so that'll probably mean more responsibility and more stress for yours truly-- I'm looking forward to it. It turns out that my old school was going to cut my elective and possibly "excess" me due to budget restraints anyway, so I feel confident in my decision to take the position at BETA. That's the update. More later.

      I'm reading  Riding the Iron Rooster  by Paul Theroux for my grad school English course.  It's a travel book about China for those of you who aren't familiar with it.  Anyway, Theroux says that Chairman Mao apparently wanted to be remembered as one thing: a teacher.  Strange.  Yesterday I went "grocery shopping" at Duane Reade for foodstuffs while I'm staying at my brother's.  The kitchen is now stocked with Smartfood popcorn, Cheddar Chex Mix, trail mix, sunflower seeds (roasted and salted), and varieties of soda.  Those of you who haven't lived with me will wonder how I will survive on such random junkfood; however, those of you who have lived with me will be impressed that I went grocery shopping at all :)

      'Bout damned time someone's taking the city on in  urlLink this ...  Dinner and drinks was great last night. It was fantastic to see so many of my wonderful friends all around the same table. I'm a lucky girl.
