      Just had a decent afternoon to check the open meet of the  urlLink  AEGIS   group after reading much mention about their open meets held at every last Saturday of the month. Held off by a number of diversions, I decided to see this one out. I went over to the designated meet location and see a small group of gamers present. After some introductions and chat, I was told and put under the impression that this is one of the slow turnouts for such a meet at such times. It wasn't a total waste of an afternoon. I did get to chat and brush up a bit of stuff with two people I know from my college gaming group. Going through with chatting the other people I haven't met or know of plus one discussion from I know, it dawned on me later on with the matter of RPG system mechanics consistency.  Game systems per se are like food or candy bars, there's elements like flavor, consistency and texture for example. The texture in this case pertaining to the adjectives  urlLink  crunchy   and  urlLink  mushy   in this instance. The mention of these two adjectives indicates the extreme ranges to a game's amount of number crunching, pertaining to the simulation of reality aspect presented in the game. This is very obvious in the character generation details and more so in execution of task resolution and especially more intensive in combat.  Excessive number crunching as a whole in gaming is something that kinda grounds out the storyteller aspects of an RPG session. Excessive modelling of reality dynamics in gaming kinda relegates an RPG session, in my thinking, as one long mathematical simulation that harkens back to RPG's earlier roots, tabletop wargaming. All this excessive nitty-gritty attention to detail to reality really puts me off in one way or the other unless I have to give in and bear with it to its lure because a particular genre, concept or idea can work and take flight in said system. I guess it would harken more to my game style is of a storytelling matter then just a string of resolution rolls which may give results contrary to what you may have in mind.  I'm more keen with less "crunchy" kinds of RPG systems since the matter of flexibility is what I prefer to use. A stable, robust system would be a more current phrase for me to say. It also makes the character creation details with the players a more shorter affair. Of course, the price for simplicity becomes apparent when certain reality or skill related questions arise. This topic of crunchiness in a game system would lead me further on into a future post regarding the limits of people in respect to being into categories of players. Next time.  *Waves bye and goes back into the doghouse.*

      Unusual food-oriented topic, neh? ^_^ It was an unexpected ideaspark that occured to me with dinner I had tonight and the movie I just watched earlier. The idea for this post title was technically started before when me and my friend Vincent bought takeout at Hotshots near the condo he stays at, about 2-3 nights ago. We were talking some Twilight Empire stuff and then mention of food sparked my mention of wasabi. The mention of wasabi consequently led me to this funny web site I go to before. Its located at   Ninja Burger  . The premise of Ninja doing food service was hilarious to see. The icing on this cake of fun is the comic strips located in the fun section. Never thought failure to meet customer request would be so...lethal. Same goes to obtaining certain supplies that run out inside the store. Its all for laughs for sure. That site and comic strip prompted me to try a cheeseburger with wasabi sauce. Some outlets would have a weak mix for wasabi while others may be so strong that I would quote "Its hot enough to make you think that you flossed your nose with a razor blade". Talk about hot stuff indeed.  That answers the Ninja Burger part. The Spaghetti Samurai thing is actually part food suggestion for dinner to my dad, part watching earlier  urlLink  The Last Samurai   and previous 2.82 viewings of Kill Bill. Its just a juggle of thoughts with the mention of spaghetti, western and eastern themes and the use of katanas in that part. It was also to note how being on the end of a gatling gun while charging on a horse is no fun indeed after sustaining some earlier injury prior to that. It was also something else to seeing again ninja on film since the slew of martial arts and ninja movies back in the 80's especially those Sho Kosugi movies with the "Ninja" movies series done by Golan-Globus. Ninja item connects back to the Ninja Burger connection as well. So it fits well all in all. Quite a combination. Makes my mouth water too at the thought.  *Gurgling drool a la Homer Simpson*  Me better mosey for now. Next time.

      Last minute posting of stuff for this day's post. Just wanted to post some lyrics from some songs of interest to me. "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" is one of my most liked songs in the Kill Bill soundtrack and more so for its use in the duel scene with Black Mamba and Cottonmouth of said movie. It goes like this:    Don't Let Be Misunderstood (Santa Esmeralda version)  Baby, do you understand me now? Sometimes I feel a little mad But don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel When things go wrong I feel real bad.  I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree With a joy that's hard to hide And sometimes it seems that, all I have to do is worry And then you're bound to see my other side  I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  If I seem edgy, I want you to know, That I never mean to take it out on you Life has its problems, and I get my share, And that's one thing I never mean to do  'Cause I love you, Oh,  Oh, oh, oh, baby - don't you know I'm human I have thoughts like any other one Sometimes I find myself, Lord, regretting Some foolish thing, some little simple thing I've done  I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood  FADE Yes, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good    This second song was more of a challenge to me by my friend  urlLink Vincent Simbulan  since the mention of how unintelligible the song of "Come On Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners go in the 80's. Of course, hearing a remake version sang by the female vocals from the band Save Ferris makes its more motivated for us 80's fans to beg the question: "Do the lyrics get heard better and more clearly compared to it originally sung by its parent band?" I went about it on researching the lyrics online to find out. And here it is.  Come On Eileen (Dexy's Midnight Runners)  Poor old Johnny Ray Sounded sad upon the radio He moved a million hearts in mono Our mothers cried and sang along and who'd blame them Now you're grown, so grown, now I must say more than ever Go toora loora toora loo rye aye And we can sing jsut like our fathers  Come on Eileen, well I swear (what he means) At this moment, you mean everything With you in that dress my thoughts I confess Verge on dirty Ah come on Eileen  These people round here wear beaten down eyes Sunk in smoke dried faces They're so resigned to what their fate is But not us, no not us We are far too young and clever Eileen I'll sing this tune forever  Come on Eileen well I swear (what he means) Ah come on, let's take off everything That pretty red dress Eileen (tell him yes) Ah come on Eileen  I did find some slight lyric variation with the  urlLink Save Ferris version  and the  urlLink No Doubt version . Pretty startling divergences for such a well-remember though muddled in lyrics department for a rockabilly song, eh? I hope I got my mission down on the lyrics question for "Come On Eileen".  Smiles  Next time.

      Another weekend ends. Not much incident really to it. Visited friend at his place in Las Pi√±as last Friday. Not much to go on since it was a matter of catching up on show and tell of stuff there and him presenting a prototype website design for our campaign. Some creative input was given at his request after looking it over with me and someone else. The Saturday following that was very much a family moment. Me, my parents, my mom friend and niece visited the hospital to see my brother and his wife, and most of all, his first born son. It was a moment of delight to my mom especially to see him. He looked so small and vulnerable. Of course, my mom and her friend have nursing backgrounds and they quibbled plenty on the details about procedures relating to nursery procedures and such. I guess such things brings out the old memories and training in them. Sunday was a bit of a stretch as I bought the VCD for   The Lost Empire (aka The Monkey King)   for my niece since she saw it before on Channel 23 and wanted to see it again. Of course, the Monkey King Legend happens to spawn a lot of anime and manga using it in loose sense of it. It harkens the time I remembered watching "Alakazam The Great", "Starzinger" (aka Spacekeeters) for starters. The Entire Dragonball franchise was inspired by this legend as well. Same goes with the anime and manga "Goku: Midnight Eye" End refresher item from that one. My niece really creates her brand of problems by doing these late evening recordings on movies she want to watch from TV but her bedtime gets in the way. The slight aggravation of it is that it effectively makes her stockpile VCR tapes at my dad's expense and mine. My mom is an exception in these cases with her soap operas, though she sometimes misses out on them herself. Recording matters aside. The rest of the Sunday afternoon was spent on another viewing of Kill Bill (Making it a total of 2.82 times watching it). I guess my limit has reached its end at this point. Its safe enough to say I can move on to watching other movies on my watch list. I'll get around to posting more interesting stuff next post. Next time.

      The day went okay. I was a bit more housebound due to recent happenings here at home. My bro's first born has entered the world at 4 lbs and 8 oz. A C-section was done due to a number of reasons. The news of this was considered a medical emergency to my folks. I'm an uncle again now to my bro's first born besides attending to my 10 year old niece. I wonder if the babysitting chores would be the same for as I attended to my niece down that long  road. Of course, the situation is slightly different since the kid would be in good care of his dad and mom.  Wierd stuff of note was I never thought that Kill Bill can be considered as a Russian movie as it infers enough that Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is just as much Russian as well to them. Just did a random search on Google to look up Hattori Hanzo and I found said article  urlLink  here  . Strange, eh? Just finished watching " urlLink  Event Horizon  " on Channel 23 earlier. Been a while since I saw that movie. It was like ages for me since I watched a sci-fi movie with this horror slant in it like this "haunted spacecraft" routine. Kinda reminds such mention in an old copy of Dune Encyclopedia I bought at a bargain back in my early years in college. Its always the case that in some sci-fi universes, there would have to be a "Ghost Ship" or "Flying Dutchman" myth circulating around to put some dark line regarding the progress of mankind's journey to the stars or use of untried technologies like the way the  urlLink  Philadelphia Experiment   went. Makes me wonder if such a boogeyman's tale may apply in the setting of my friend's Twilight Empire setting.  My friend  urlLink  Vincent Simbulan   has celebrated his birthday as of this entry's date. Many more temporal cycles for you to go buddy!! Things are kinda patched up with me and my friend from my last blog entry. Things are kinda looking right for the meantime until another bump on the road to our existence.  I'll keep on going for the meantime. Next time.

      The title for this post kinda sums up some things after having a decent round of conversation with a friend of mine. It was much more so validated based on this bit of conversation over the phone:   Over The Phone: (Start of the conversation went nicely until discussion of Kill Bill transits over to mention of blog matter) Waterdog: "I wrote a lot of Kill Bill stuff on my blog, two posts worth." Incensed, Disappointed Friend: "Don't tell me about your blog. You still owe me regarding your character journal." Waterdog:  Stunned silence for a few seconds  "...Uh...fine, fine" (After that moment, conversation resumes at a normal pace and tone.)   I'm not saying that this friend of mine is being depicted as the bad guy in this case. I will definitely own up to the fault and reality for the way-late and current no submission of my character journal for my friend's RPG character journal requirement. The intent of the character journal was to depict events happening in a game session through a character's eyes. At first thought, it sounded good and thought that I can handle it. I was sorely mistaken. It was a monumental task of squeezing out all pertinent details out of my memory to get the details to the exact resolution to put into kilobytes.  The other contributing factor is also that this friend I speak of has been through a lot of rough times and major loads of disappointments and betrayal in his life. It makes him, very distrustful of other people, in spite sharing common interests or creative inclination. I'm surprised me and him held out our friendship this far since high school. I guess it the camel's back yet waiting for the straw to break it as of this part of temporal existence may break due to some unexpected strain to due failure to commitment or other.  I do have a lot going on my end, though I am pretty much a couch potato, net junkie, mallrat and slacker rolled into one disappointing package. I mean I can go about transcribing an episode summary of sorts for each game session we conclude but go into a lengthy amount of typing to go over ever aspect of thought process behind a character's actions and words may prove a bit overwhelming for me. I'm just an idea guy, mostly short, concise stuff I do not this lengthy, huge to compile stuff. Slacker/lazy viewpoint or not, I go about with things with least resistance to handle that one. I can tackle something that big if it is very awe-inspiring in its way then I may be that motivated to go into such exhaustive detail as I can.  Of course, that would be if I'm under the influence of the Muse. Of course, one's own Muse may vary for certain creative endeavors or media which can sustain either briefly or as a mainstay in the creative process. Currently, I don't have a Muse to motivate far into these things.  I will forgive my friend's mistrust with matters of commitment but everything else was okay between us, though his socializing skills are not up to specs or his tolerances for that matter.  I'll contemplate about this for while until I get sidetracked by something cool or otherwise as my distraction affinity gets to be high in these cases and times. Till next.  Trudges slowly back into the doghouse before a heavy sigh was enacted.

      The recent weekend turned out okay, especially last Saturday. Saturday was pretty another round of consultation and brain-storming for the Twilight Empires and peripheral Blaqueguard stuff. There happens to be a measure of inter-connectedness with the things with those two projects since they happen in the same universe. Besides those exchanges of idea, it was also a moment of recalling and reminiscing the old high school days since the topic of 80's music was brought into the discussion thanks to the recent wave of remakes that sets upon our listening shores everywhere.  In spite watching Kill Bill around 1.8 times so far, it seems to me that I can't seem to get enough of it. It can be compared to an accident site, one tries to look away at it but gets the bizarre, twisted urge to look at it. Some movies can do that to you. Besides kick-ass swordplay, knife-fighting and a kawaii schoolgirl with a mean streak, my mind keeps imagining siege scenes from whatever siege event in some books I read because of LOTR:ROTK, another movie I may consider watching again even though I'm not sure of surviving another 3 hour sit-through of it. There are tolerances to a viewer as how long a movie they can watch you know.  With the mention of Kill Bill, I just happened to acquire the Kill Bill soundtrack CD at the local CD shop. I was excited to be able to hear at last "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" by Santa Esmeralda in its entirety. Went to that track upon getting home and popping in into the CD player. I guess I begin to realize I'm a bit of a sucker for Spanish guitar or Flamenco music, more so in an action movie with duel scenes. The CD also contains also contains two dialogue tracks that were taken from the movie. One is the explanation of O-Ren as to the mention of her heritage after beheading Boss Tanaka. The other one is where Bill and Sophie were talking of her ordeal by Black Mamba's hands. So for those Julie Dreyfus fans, you'll have your listening pleasure.  I did some slight digging on IMDB and sniffed around at the message board and discovered mentioned that the original script for Kill Bill had a slightly different structure. It also purported that Go Go Yubari has a younger sister, by one year, by the name of Yuki Yubari. There was supposed to be a more of a vengeful gun battle scene between Black Mamba and Yuki where Yuki received the news last of Go Go's death by Black Mamba's hand. The scene also calls for the Pussy Wagon, Black Mamba appropriated from Buck, was shot up under sustained firing by an Uzi in Yuki's hands. Parts of the dialogue used between Go Go and Black Mamba in the House of Blue Leaves duel was supposed to be done for Yuki and Black Mamba.  Here's a sample:                                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)                          I know you feel you must avenge                          your sister. But I beg you...walk                          away.                           Yuki giggles.                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          You call that begging? You can beg                          better than that.  Another amusing bit to seen is in the dialogue after Yuki gets clipped by Black Mamba's return fire during this gun battle scene. It goes like this:                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          You fucking bitch! You shot me in                          my breast! They're not fully                          developed yet, you fucking asshole!                          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!                 The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's                giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          Piss me off!                 She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up                everything around the Bride.                 When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;                                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)                          Yuki, in about two minutes there's                          going to be an army of police here.                          So if you're gonna kill me, now's                          the time.                 From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue                powder. It gives her energy.                                     THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)                          So what's it gonna be bitch?                 Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          That fucking does it!  Another interesting bit that would have been done to illustrate that existence of Yuki was also supposed to be with Sophie's interrogation scene in the car trunk flashback. It goes like:                                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)                          Okay, first things first. Where was                          the other Yubari sister? Yuki?                                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)                          Yuki's sick. She went home early.                                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)                          Do tell? What's wrong with her?                                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)                          She has a cold.                                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)                          Awwww poor baby. What do you think                          she'll do when she finds out what                          happened?                                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)                          She'll wail with grief.                                                             SHOCK CUT TO                 YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...                 She SCREAMS!                 BACK TO SOFIE                                     SOFIE                          She'll drink excessively.                 BACK TO YUKI                Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.                 BACK TO SOFIE                                     SOFIE                          She'll start trouble.                 BACK TO YUKI                sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in                a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the                make on her.                                     BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)                          Do you like Ferraris?                 Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          Ferrari...Italian trash.                 She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the                business suit.                                     YUKI (JAPANESE)                          Do you find me hot?                 The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she                gets annoyed;  The scene of her drinking and causing an older guy a lot of pain and possibly death was carried into the part describing Go Go's lack of age made up by madness bit in the voiceover.   I guessed the Yubari sister angle was nixed in the 1st Vol. unless it is yet to be seen in the second volume since Chiaki Furayama's name is still listed for it when I checked IMDB last time. If the possibility still exists then, Go Go fans would rejoice at her reappearance, no matter how brief it'll be again.  I'll still think it over as to indulge another round of watching LOTR:ROTK or Kill Bill before a new movie shows up by this coming Wednesday, "The Last Samurai" starring Tom Cruise may be next on my watchlist since it also starred Hiroyuki Sanada, aka Henry Sanada. That Japanese actor appeared in "Ringu" and a certain 80's tokusatsu show that is borrowing a lot of influence from Star Wars.  I filled enough for my quota on this post. Till next time.  Picks up daisho set and straps them on and walks back into the doghouse. "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" playing.

      Just did some websurfing and decided to look up something that reminded me of the old high school campaign days which became the Twilight Empires project of my friend and a far cry from its initial Gamma World RPG roots. I was reading up again about Iron Man, a Marvel Comicbook Series. It was that title along with X-Men that got me more along the sci-fi trail for sure. That and a number of sci-books, TV shows and anime.  It was something of a wonder for me to look at such an intriguing piece of high tech. Fictional or not, its still pretty good tech to look over. It pretty much puts me in with the techie junkies, more of the conceptual sort than one who goes about building or drawing it up. Such exposure makes me fluent enough to have mastery of the language in obvious circles, as techno-babble.  It all started when I got a hold of copy of the earlier Marvel Universe Handbook series in which they had an issue called "The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Book of Weapons, Hardware and Paraphernalia" which I bought a long while back when my comic-collecting days have just barely started in high school. All that technical illustrations and terminologies in it got me drawn in big time. Its a bit dog-eared due to my initial lack of comic-handling and preservation skills then, but it still served much as my initial foundation to refashioning the campaign setting from post-nuclear apocalyptic world to a quantum jump to the high-fantasy/space operatic setting that will become the Twilight Empires for my friend's project. It also kept me on the path of being a fiction-tech technologist. Even if matters of magic are brought in, I would try to put a sci-fi slant into it.   If one were to look at it, a la VH1's "Behind The Music", the entire enterprise of that world's building is all a matter of pilfering a lot of things we wanted to put in and showcase. It was an unspoken escalation of sorts as access to outside media and info because a task unto itself where basic creativity is not enough to pace with a lot of eyecandy and ideacandy becoming available to a high schooler's means and budget that time. Of course, this was back in the 80's, way before the era of the Internet, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM media, Network Gaming and tons of anime. Back then, one has to go about it the hard way, reading pocketbooks, encyclopedias, some magazines, technical and science books plus the occasional dip into that wordtome, the dictionary. Now in the early 2000's we have so much sources of information that the line on originality gets to be less defined and differentiated from the inundation of data, useful or junk, from the Internet and other media, especially from computer games and anime.   Negatives aside, the effort from all that idea and data trawling yielded an interesting mix and synergy of ideas and creativity which somehow makes an orderly sense in spite the apparent chaos from the culling of the data and ideas. I find it in retrospect, that some ideas trawled would have a time and place for it to be of use since it was retained by how many times the stories of the game have been retold with my many exchanges with my friends and fellow gamers in high school. As I said before in an earlier post, informartion is a commodity. No matter how irrelevant the information is, it can be refashioned, reformatted or repackage for use at the right moment. The occasional thoughtspark of an idea can occur to me whether as a sliver of an idea or question, it just happens after exposure to something familiar or occurs to form at unlikely times.  As to imagination and stories of old, I can sum it simply enough that sometimes the best ones or touching ones are those simply thought or made when one is a child. I'll leave it to these lyrics from "When I needed you" from Erasure's "The Innocents" album:  I‚Äôd like to be a child again So many things to do Playground noise, and coloured toys And everything brand new  I‚Äôd like to be a pirate ship In search of hidden gold On ocean waves that swim away And sail around the world  -chorus: Where, where were you When I needed you most When I needed a friend Where, where were you When I needed you most When I needed a friend  I‚Äôd like to be a soldier A general I would be In battle and in glory With ten thousand men to lead  I could be most anything There is so much to see I‚Äôd live a different story If you were next to me  Chorus  Chorus  I could be most anything There is so much to see I‚Äôd live a different story If you were next to me  Where, where  Chorus to fade    Yawns.  Enough of me talking. Will keep on posting. Till next time. Goes back into the doghouse. Seconds after entering the doghouse, sounds of machines, crackling of energy and other tech sounds emanate.

      I would like to thank my high school friend, gamer and fellow creative person,   Vincent Simbulan   for mentioning my name and its linkage to my blog here. May our many sessions of brainstorming, critiques and exchanges of ideas and info bear fruit with your Twilight Empires project, which I was more than happy to run the campaign to its resolution like a long-running sci-fi TV series or anime series for that matter. I still have a lot of stuff to handle on my end since that sidestory in the Twilight Empires would still take time while doing duty filling in the gaps and facts for the main title. A whole lot of thanks to you my friend.  Waves the banner for the Gamma Confederation

      Had a busy day of the sort, paid some local fees to let the Philippines know I'm living here on its shores legally. The procedure in payment was done rather quickly and painlessly I am amazed to say than last year's usual round of waiting in line for a long while. I guess me and Dad got there at a non-peak time. I cringe enough how last minute applications and fee payments go for those planning to leave the country or pay their registration fees late. All in all that part of the day goes without incident.  The rest of the day went okay. Did some looking around at the Glorietta in Makati for my usual expedition there to scope out new games for PS2 and PC, books at the bookstores and some other neato stuff I consider buying or looking, within my means of course. Also watched   Kill Bill   the second time today since I failed to watch the earlier 20 minutes due to traffic towards SM Bicutan yesterday. I'll get to what I can say about the movie. Its brutal and bloody, just as much as straight in your face Quentin does with his earlier movies to some degree. I haven't fully finished watching Reservoir Dogs but I've seen how messy and violent and profanity-filled things go in it as much one sees all that in spades in Kill Bill.   Kill Bill is rather a homage/indirect parody with regards to those 70's martial arts movies, especially with the Japanese spin on it. That movie also touched more on the Avenging Samurai road as well like those in early Japanese cinema as well. There was that back-to-basics approach in depicting and handling fight scenes. Fight choreographer Yuen Wo Ping gives a hand to this one. A very sought after expert with wire-assisted fight scenes, definitely the man to go to like "Fighting On Wire R Us" kind of thing.  The Crazy 88 massacre scene that happened in the House of Blue Leaves is definitely one up over the so-called fakeness done in Matrix Reloaded's infamous/famous Burly Brawl scene. A long fight scene not  to be viewed for the squeamish for sure. I mean even the startup with Sofie Fatale's (played by Julie Dreyfus) arm cut off to get O-Ren's attention. A lot of blood spilt, limbs severed and a lot of maimed Yakuza people fall down to The Bride's (Soon to be revealed as Beatrix Kiddo aka Black Mamba) Hattori Hanzo Original Katana. The ceremony of the katana's handing over to The Bride is very much like those old samurai films as to how samurai or ronin heroes get their well-crafted blades. The way Hattori Hanzo says that the blade he gave to The Bride is one capable of cutting god if she encounters on her path is a metaphorical but also a manner of naming the blade she holds in her hands.  It was a known fact that Quentin Tarantino went through a lot of films (anime and non-anime I supposed.) to put together his own brand of a samurai movie as I see it. He pretty much breaks the conventions in some respects about samurai/martial arts movies though some are keen to say that's its a parody (or stab) at the current crop of action movies that are riding on the wave of innovation and flash that the Matrix set the bar for. Of course, the Matrix movies pretty much saturated the thought of the viewing public as to how martial arts movies are done to some degree since its a phenomenon unto itself.  Technicalities aside, I liked it as an action movie, and occasional martial arts movie junkie. The soundtrack for this movie sounds great to me since I caught wind of one song played on a locally made TV trailer for it. In my case, it was the song "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" (Santa Esmerelda version). Questionable song as it is for some music critics, but I kinda like that pseudo-Mexican flair with the guitars and the lyrics going with it. It also strikes me much that the sounds used makes me also see the movie as one samurai movie with a cowboy western thing to it. Very much how samurais and cowboys go as heroes go.  Enough on the critique of this movie. I'll get around to my review to my watching of Return Of The King soonest.  P.S. Go Go Yubari played by Chiaki Kuriyama is one nasty psycho-bitch of a schoolgirl. I don't want to meet one for sure, kawaii schoolgirl uniform or not.  Quickly retreats back into the doghouse.

      Whew!! Just got back earlier from watching Lord Of The Rings: Return of The King (LOTR:ROTK for short). It has quite a lot of fighting within those three hours. All that clatter, rumbling and screeching one would have to brave through with a movie theater's jacked up sound system. Did the movie thing after paying off this month's Internet bill in order to continue with my websurfing, email checking and the periodic updates to this blog. I also noticed that comment script I used on this blog had been inactive because of the its connecting server account has been suspended. I had to do some script replacement on my template to restore any comment posting functions on my blog. Nearly got me panicked there. Not much time to fill up more stuff on this post for the blog due early departure plans the following morning. Late nights are usually the best time to do updates but my brain is not up to the task of churning out something of import. Maybe next time I'll have something interesting to put up.  Trudges back into the doghouse, tired and weary.

      Monday was just a slow day like Sunday yesterday. Napped the whole afternoon. Just had 30-45 minute session on my PS2 to try my mettle at playing Fatal Frame II, after holding it off for a bit. I did play a bit of it yesterday for like 30 minutes before losing my nerve and what I would think as maximum exposure time. Playing the game pretty sets you on edge after turning off the PS2 and setting down the controller for sure. Makes one antsy when you walk in a dark hall or dark area of the house. Me and my niece would holler or scream whenever a ghost battle occurs in the game. These ghostly encounters in the game pop out without some slight measure of warning compared to the earlier Fatal Frame game. Some of the non-combat picture taking in the game can be freaky with the kind of ghostly apparations caught on film.  Shudders and shivers  I told my niece I had to call it quits for this session on account of my tolerance wearing out for scary stuff. Also went through some panic and withdrawal from a malfunctioning VCR after a brief dose of a power interruption that froze and locked out any control function. Dumb luck solution I did, disconnect it from the outlet for like 2 days. At least I can move back my PS2 to my room with the VCR functioning again. Some day I have, even though slow I call it. Next time.  Waves bye and goes back into the doghouse, tired and exhausted with frayed nerves. Camera held limply in hand.

       *Occasional guzzling of Cherry Coke while typing up this post.*  Sunday was a lazy kind of day. I was tempted to go watch  urlLink  Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King  , the final installment to the Lord of The Rings. But I was held back on prior experience that this movie would be flooded by the newly anointed masses who became insta-fans for watching this thing but of course, gamers and geeks would know this spectacular series it came from. I would agree with my friend that these people are crazy to think that the books are the adaptation of the movie when the reality of it is, the books predate the movies and was the basis for it. Silly people. Speaking of silly people. My mom was asking about which Blade movie was showing on Channel Seven this Sunday night. Watching the first few minutes clued me in that its the 1st one and I told my mom that. I decided to watch it a bit for the meantime while attending to doing waterboy duties of getting water into the house's storage for the evening. An every-other evening ritual I go through. Anyways, while watching  urlLink  Blade   on Channel 7 and expecting the blood shower sequence in the starting part, I was sorely disappointed when it suddenly cuts to Blade standing and the blood shower stopped. Damnit! Kinda much cuts out the usual idea of imagining a Sabbat Dance Club when such skipping happens. What makes it worse was the obvious cuts in the fighting with all that gunfire, slashing and stake usage with attendant ashing effects removed. Gah!!! If they allow some gunfire footage to be shown, they have to mute out the gunshot sounds. These people can literally reduce an action movie into an inanimate mess of moving images and sounds. They keep doing this everytime to any action movie they show on air. What's with these people behind the editting? Its like you have to make the viewers scratch their heads in thought and have them really on their imagination (Defective or not) to fill in the gaps. Sometimes those gaps are very important to understanding the whole story. It would be like tantamount to running a movie without sounds and all you have to go on is your imagination and ability to read responses and such. Believe me, its no picnic. I remembered well enough when me and friend of mine watched " urlLink  Lost In Space  " that the sounds cut out in the first few minutes and it was so crazy that we kinda heckled to fill in our own sound effects as if it was done in Mystery Science Theater 3000. Its just so plain crazy how sloppy editting really guts a movie as storytelling ability vehicle for the sake of censorship. What a ship of fools we are riding if these kind of senseless things go about in spite their claims of doing the common good for all. Retardation is more like it. Anyways, next times post would be more pleasant or sensible to hear.  Finishes the can of Cherry Coke. Properly disposes the can. Picks up Camera Obscura and checks it out. Heads back into the doghouse to do more ghostbusting via camera,

      This is not a Ringu or Lion King oriented topic. Its more in keeping with the company gets to be in. I had a decent afternoon earlier by hanging around at my friend's comic book shop, even though he arrived rather late. As to elaborate on the mention of circles, it was something that dawned on me after meeting a number of people with similiar interests or preoccupations. Being in such company of people have a certain synergistic effect of inspiration or motivation. A cynical way of looking at it is just trying to go above and out of the shadows of these selfsame people one deals with on a day-to-day or occasional basis. That and possible some matter of hubris or envy that goes into it. Anyways, as I look at it, being in such presences has a its own pros and cons. Major pro would be one gets to be in a company of people who can help inspire or motivate oneself, especially in my case to date, creativity. The con of it would depending on these selfsame people you associate it with it also marks you as part of the group or having such preferences to these kinds of people. I can be guilty under such but I take matters of association seriously as a means to create a network as one would say in this age of Network Marketing or in the more shadier Pyramid Scam vernacular. I guess the popular saying of "No man is an island" surely holds true in this sense of things. Its helps in exchanges of idea, critique and relevant information and news. It gives one the means to be able to have a finger on the pulse, to be current so to say. Information is something of a commodity in some circles or not but information is exchanged nonetheless. I find it that interconnectivity is what makes a civilization flourish and grow and yet provides the means to its destruction. Two-edged sword this matter of information exchange. Kinda reminds me that book "Snow Crash" by Neil Stephenson, one of my favorite writers after reading that book and "Diamond Age". Still yet haven't gone about reading "Cryptonomicon" which I have a copy sitting in my room somewhere. Have to dig it up sometime when I clear out my current reading cue.  Shrugs and goes back into the doghouse to dust away stacks of books and look for the some titles to read for the interrim.

      No reviews or anything of the sort for this spot. Pretty dull here in the doghouse. Supposed to visit a friend's place but that got rain-check due to health reasons. Went online to look up some stuff, no biggie on that one. Skimmed through a number of message items about Fatal Frame II on  urlLink  GameFAQs  . Reading some of the message posts with regards to certain encounters in that game makes my skin crawl and sometimes make me paranoid.  Shudders.  On a more non-horror note, got an Instant Message from my bro that he just got his copy of the Interstella 5555 DVD from the US.  urlLink  Interstella 5555   is basically the definitive OAV that rounds up the open ended story established by Daft Punk's songs "One More Time", "Aerodynamic", "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" from their "Discovery" Album. I was pretty blown away on seeing the music video of "One More Time". I caught "Aerodynamic" subsequently. I missed out watching the music videos for "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" while I was staying in Seattle. I was able to watch them off the Internet though some search engine inquiries. It was obvious to note the art style of Leiji Matsumoto of Space Cruiser Yamato, Galaxy Express 999, and Captain Harlock fame as he was approached by Daft Punk to collaborate on this project. Interstella 5555 answers and concludes the story established in those 4 music videos and it looked pretty impressive. Daft Punk really hit it good this time to fans of techno music and anime for sure. I'm looking forward to borrowing it from my brother when he's done watching it. The wait was worth it for sure. As the line from the 1st Daft Punk song from Discovery album would go: "One More Time...." :)

      Had an entertaining afternoon, my brother was able to lend me his DVDs of " urlLink  Mallrats  ", " urlLink  Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back  " and " urlLink  Cowboy Bebop (The Movie)  ". I decided to check out "Mallrats" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strikes Back" ( JaSBSB for short for the remainder of this post. ) and table "Cowboy Bebop" for later viewing. It was long delayed for me to watch JaSBSB since I watched the earlier Kevin Smith movies, " urlLink  Clerks  ", "Mallrats", " urlLink  Chasing Amy  " and " urlLink  Dogma  ". Most of these movies I watched at home, either videotape or DVD except one, Dogma, which I luckily watched in a movie theater when it had a brief run here in the Philippines. JaSBSB is features those two stoners, Jay and Silent Bob, who appeared in the earlier 4 movies prior to this one. I'm not sure exactly which of these films totally comprise the so-called "New Jersey Trilogy" as Kevin Smith puts it. If five movies comprise a trilogy then I would harken that to Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" as the same since it took five books to round up the entire thing. Online critics lambasted this movie to death which becomes all too moot on grounds of profanity, the burden of listening to Jay's constant stream of profanity and street talk, the overused jokes and satire. As Jason Lee says it: "Critics Schmitics". I watched the movie and got myself amused at what's there to see. It was good that characters from the earlier movies do show up, especially at the near end of the movie. It was really funny at the end when Jay and Silent Bob visited all the people who were bad-mouthing them on the I-net and beat the holy crap out of them. Ahhhhh...payback. :) Not much else to think on. I'll just go about my business for now and post more stuff as it is.  Goes back into the doghouse to dig up some stuff in its depths.

      Spent most of the day going online to websurf but also finished a Playstation 2 game called  urlLink  Freedom Fighters   by EA Games, developed by IO Entertainment. Playing this game would harken you back to that 80's movie,  urlLink  Red Dawn   and other similiar scenario movies involving a Russian invasion of the U.S. Of course, it would seem very familiar to the more recent generation and crowd to the premise in the Command & Conquer's Red Alert 1 and 2 storyline. High-tech fluff of Red Alert far removed in this game, Freedom Fighters is a more straight-forward tactical real-time squad game. You play the hero Christopher Stone, a New York Plumber  (Imagine a better looking non-mustachioed Mario with an AK-47, Molotovs and his trusty monkey wrench, and there you go) , who's thrust into the role of a Freedom Fighter to liberate New York from Russian Occupation Forces due to circumstances of him being at the wrong place at the wrong time. He doesn't fight the never-ending fight alone for freedom and the American way, nosirree, he has help. Of course, that help requires charisma,  (Its an attribute or quality, not a woman as you think, sheesh)  that grants you the force of personality to recruit other like minded people to your cause, the kind who has guns and knows how to use them too. The plot is rather thin but serviceable to make you go through the trials and turns of the liberation campaign called for. As to the other item in the title, I popped in another Playstation 2 game disk into the console,  urlLink  Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly   by Tecmo, for a look at the game in its demo mode. Letting the demo movie play was pretty intriguing yet unsettling to say the least. This game has a direct tie-in to its predecessor title  urlLink  Fatal Frame  . Under the survival horror genre, this game is far different than the likes of Silent Hill or Resident Evil. As I recall a comment on some message board or review: "If Silent Hill is like watching a David Lynch film, then Fatal Frame is like Ringu".  (Ringu is the original Japanese movie that inspired the Hollywood version called "The Ring".)  As I can vouch for the game itself, this game is creepy like heck. Tecmo really did an outstanding job on using the Japanese folklore and ghost stories to full effect as well as the intent of evoking psychological terror for our fear of the unknown. The unique trademark of this game is that the only weapon you use in the game is a camera. "A camera?!" you'd say. Its no ordinary camera to say the least, it has supernatural abilities to exorcise and sense supernatural entities or phenomena in range of its viewfinder. Watching or playing the game with or without people nearby is pretty startling enough. The game is something that few people would dare play without the lights on and with full sound at maximum. It would probably scare the daylights of most people except a jaded minority for sure. I'll touch on other things next time since I note that this day's entry is long unto itself. Till next time.  Loads up a Machinegun and packs a camera as afterthought and trudges back into the doghouse.

      My niece sleeps now to the soundtrack of a favorite Playstation 2 game of mine,  urlLink  Kingdom Hearts  . I remember well enough that me and my niece finished that game about a year ago, same time the Playstation 2 unit was bought by me. I was so caught up with it upon seeing the commercials for the game back in Seattle and the hook that reeled me in was the music. It was the song "Simple and Clean", PlANITb Remix version. That song was actually reworked into English from the original Japanese song "Hikari" by Hikaru Utada. Its still quite good to listen it. As to the game, its a rather unique blend of Disney characters and Squaresoft's famous Final Fantasy characters set with a unique storyline and setting and focuses through Sora, the hero of the story. The characters of Disney in the game would possibly merit an automatic "kiddie" game but its not, the themes are pretty much a tad like those used in Final Fantasy VIII, which is for the non-kiddie set, is rather saccharine for their tastes and something that makes some hardcore macho gamers cringe in afterthought. The game's ending scene is heart-warming yet sad in a way that makes a hopeless romantic like me gets his eyes moist on watching it and listening to the dialogue. A sequel to this game is still in the works for its English version since the Japanese version is underway. This kind of review is kinda done to death but I decided to use it as a springboard to start other things later on with this blog. Test rambling done for now.

           Not exactly a title for one of those Hollywood Movies, its more of how I value my privacy. The only domain of privacy we know to have and live in away from the routines of day to day life is one's own room. It was something of short supply for the less fortunate who don't have a more spacious home like the more fortunate, myself included. As of yesterday, its compromised on account of my brother staying over due to a possible flu infection, which wasn't thankfully serious. Just a slight fever and a bout of weakness, I guess stress from work and the arrival of my soon-to-be nephew this coming February. Tonight I have my 10 year old niece sleep in my room since my mom complains of how much squirming my niece does in her sleep. The timing was rather bad since I was supposed to catalog and prepare files to be burned into CD and privacy is what I need in this case to focus on the task at hand without being bothered. Of course, this is to be a feat unto itself if I proceed.  *Sighs.*  I'll have to do what I can until the period of compromise is over by tomorrow. Still doing some tweaking and recalling my HTML skills at the interim. Still looking for some nice blog templates though to use.  *Shrugs.*  Back to doghouse.  *Goes back into the doghouse.

       Hello there, wandering netizen!!  Just got started on this weblog business after seeing some of my friends having set up their and it was rather appealing in a sense. I see it as a way to get back into doing creative stuff after being caught up in things banal and routine. I'll do what I can to post what's on my mind as soon and best I can. Thanks for dropping by.  Walks back into the doghouse and disappears into its spacious interior.

      ‚ÄúObject retrieved. Leaving the room.‚Äù   Vesper   declared as she started to leave the room. Shift of movement at the edge of her vision.  ‚ÄúSho, the room has a stone demon inside. Vesper‚Äôs going to need help.‚Äù   Devon   pointed out the obvious fact after some last minute research based on Vesper‚Äôs video feed.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just great. Reynard. Gregor. We have a hostile. Back-up and cover Vesper‚Äôs exit as well as Victoria.‚Äù Sho picked up an assault rifle, equipped with high-powered scope and underslung grenade launcher. Devon have picked up his weapon as well as they both exited the van. Each of the members of Excelsis softly called a brief prayer to their patron saints.  ‚ÄúGetting overconfident again, huh Vesper?‚Äù   Victoria   was on her way out as soon as the situation was broadcast over their team frequency. She‚Äôs well away from the mansion after announcing that she's taking a break from a round of singing for the party inside it.  ‚ÄúNot my fault. The intel was half-baked at the last second. I need to get out and leave this stony, ugly pursuer of mine.‚Äù Vesper quickly exitted the ventilation duct and onto the roof of the building. An inhuman growl echoed through the duct.  ‚ÄúAbout time some action we will see.‚Äù Gregor got into position and pulled out his twin autopistols.  ‚ÄúThis party‚Äôs really getting started now.‚Äù   Reynard   mused from a sniper position and noted the rush of dogs and guards as the alarm is sounded.  Sounds of weapon fire echoed in the night air. Screams and exclamations of the mansion‚Äôs guests also abound as they try to vacate the premises.  Minutes later after the alarm was sounded, Victoria made it back to the van without incident on her exit. She's dressed in a stunning evening dress that went with her role as a torchlight singer inside the mansion earlier. Devon and Sho waited outside with weapons drawn for the welcome they‚Äôll be giving to Vesper‚Äôs pursuer.  Reynard and Gregor made it back to the van as well and seeing Vesper brought up the rear while a large growling form of rock chased after her. Teammates fired weapons at the pursuing form.  They have faith in themselves to get the job done. Whether it be humans or demons and other strangeness.  Just a routine flow of the mission for ones working in Excelsis.    Author note:  My friend  urlLink  Vinnie   checked an earlier draft of the above mentioned piece. I admitted it was a bit truncated due to the urgent rush of getting it up. The earlier version I showed him has a better flow of things. I'll be putting an improved version of this Excelsis story as soon as I complete it and have it edited by Vinnie.

      Had a rather interesting and intriguing Saturday. The afternoon was much okay with the usual visit to Vinnie's shop in Megamall. It was the evening that got a rather exciting turn with a role-playing session, GMed by  urlLink Dean  and it was done in 3 acts. Too bad it was short-lived session given how much dialogue and outtakes went into it. It it were done into a movie, it would have its commentary and outtake section for the laughs. I also liked how organic and mushy the handling of the session went. No stats, no number crunching. Just pure storytelling. The stuff which makes RPing as to what it supposed to be. Something I did before back in 3rd year high-school.       I was a bit overwhelmed at the start and at some points of the dialogue since subject matter involved, especially Act III's scene which I would call "Conversations with Samael and Seraphim" was kinda deep for me to formulate a response. The 1st act would read off like your run-of-the-mill horror movie startup but when Act II started up and ended, the players involved felt the sentiments of thinking "Do we have to go back to being those helpless students? We liked being the way cool operators of Excelsis." Act III was a rather mind-bending twist of getting into a debate with the Serpent, mentioned in the Book of Genesis of the Old Testament. Player-wise, I had a distinctly niggling sensation that the entire lynchpin to the Serpent's plan is of the choice, the initiation of it and not the resolution or the end-result of it would be the key to liberating it from its captivity.        The Act II aspects were pretty much the stuff of a high-budget production with SFX to outdo the Matrix in my view. I mean its pretty way cool to having superhuman abilities powered by faith then that done by Neo for sure. The matter of the Excelsis team's Saint-based abilites powered by faith harkens me back when I collected all the issues of St. George from the Shadowline Comics made under Marvel. I pretty liked  Michael Devlin  as the current Knight of St. George       The RP session that night all in all was fun and memorable.  urlLink Carl 's character protrayal of Keisha was definitely one of the highlights of the session, especially with Keisha talking to Samael.  Vinnie 's character Anton was pretty much into the lengthy debate aspect of it which was quite interesting to see from either perspective as player or character. This session I've been a part of has made me see how much away I was from what I've been in high school and a bit of the college RP days. I can sum it up that such a great session would be done with a innovative or compelling story, players backing up characters as best they can put in the portrayal and of course, the power of imagination working through it.        The mention of this blog's title was attributed to prior discourse with Dean and Vinnie prior to the late evening's RP session involving the matter of high-fantasy. I'll not dig into the nitty-gritty of the matter of the state of high-fantasy and the literary quality associated with it. The interesting kernel of the discussion was Dean's mention of the silver bullet. Silver bullet, Golden BB, whatever magic element projectile it may be, can be defined as something that would be like an intense creative investment of sorts that would make the project in question worthwhile from its creation to its final production, regardless of the outcome that can affect the creator's view as long as the said creator in question is satisfied with the project and what it comprised of. It is very much something that can make a written work a good one or just a run-of-the-mill hack job given the level of creative investment put into it. Of course, such ammunition in question is rather finite but possibly replenishable as one goes through the experiences of life for certain that would create and shape more ammunition to use in future endeavors that would call for it.       All in all it was a rather interesting Saturday. The conversations and the role-playing session involved makes it a memorable one.

      Valentine's Day has come and gone over the recent weekend. If there was an equivalent for a Scrooge like in Christmas, then there may be an equivalent for Valentine's and I usually be like that for such an occasion while everyone else have someone to fawn and get cozy with. Years ago, it would be easier to shut myself in my room for the day and listen to music from Erasure and Belinda Carlisle for the duration but that changed when my niece lives here with us. It was a wonderful moment when my bro and his wife brought their son to the house. My mom was delighted to take care of her new grandson and it was a great feeling to see a new face added to the family.  Regardless of that, it still made me dig up my CDs to listen to the familiar songs to pass away the month of February for the duration or when other music catches my fancy. I would be listening to Erasure songs:  urlLink Leave Me To Bleed ,  urlLink My Heart So Blue ,  urlLink Spiralling ,  urlLink Victim of Love  and Belinda Carlisle songs:  Vision of You ,  urlLink A Woman and A Man  and  urlLink Always Breaking My Heart . But that didn't happen in one day. I probably be listening to some of them for the rest of the month. At least this year's Valentine's Day isn't a total downer for me. I will proceed to more cheerier topics next time.

      Toys are something for a child to play with. These can vary from material objects to small animals. In the case of adults it encompasses to mechanisms or machines, including other people in some twisted sense of ownership to them.  I mention the word toy is that it is more concerned with the RPG or game setting regarding the so-called toys in that area. It generally encompass weapons, armor, vehicles and mecha to point out. It has become something as a material pleasure of sorts to be in the presence of objects that represent a number of virtues or qualities. Of course, utility can be considered as one obvious quality.  I speak of this on recently perusing a copy of the "Out of The Vaults" technology sourcebook for the latest incarnation of Gamma World under the D20 system. Since this newest incarnation of the game has shifted the focus on the outdated concept of post-atomic mayhem, it deals more with the nanotech and biotech consequences which mutated the landscape of a war-torn Earth.   Toys of note have stayed the same for some while others no longer exist. The infamous Black Ray weapons are still there. Laser weaponry is still de rigeur in this setting. The fusion rifle is also present though its illustration in the book reminds one more of a more stylized proton pack of Ghostbusters' fame. Mark V and VII rifles of the current version are now plasma discharging weapons replacing the older incarnation idea of force-field breaking sonic blasters. High-end and high-tech armor has been more relegated to sleek and nano-driven/constructed suits compared to the more old hardtech constructed varieties of Powered Armor: Energized Armor, Inertia Armor, Powered Alloyed Plate, Powered Assault Armor, Powered Attack Armor, Powered Plate Armor and Powered Scout Armor. Above mentioned armor types may have built-in weapons. Atomic Power Cells not included. Medical supplies in that book are different from what I know. No more days of subsisting on Sustenance doses when food supplies are scarce but the current incarnation Universal Cooker makes up the lack of it in a way. A lot of stuff has been changed or no longer presented since the newer trends dictated in the world of sci-fi and real science plus political correctness of today's times.  Reading through the latest incarnation of that new book made me dig up my old copy of the game and draw my comparisons on the tech. It was a good stroll through memory lane in gaming for that one. Next time.  *Marches back into the doghouse. Servos within a well-used suit of Powered Assault Armor moves him effortlessly towards the doghouse.*

      Just following a similiar tack from my friend   Vinnie  's blog about his wierd science post. It was something I came across on a random search on google with regards to weapons tech. I stumbled across on this website called   Deep Angel  . Its an interesting site loaded with CG Image candy. The site was about the premise of future navies using supercavitation subs. Supercavitation occurs when an object moving though water reaches speeds in excess of 100 knots (110mph). If the object has a correctly shaped ‚Äòcavitator‚Äô on its nose, a bubble of air starts to form around the object... This extends to cover the entire object, and hence the object is no longer moving through water, but through air, which creates but a fraction of the friction. Supercavitation was discovered by Russian scientists when they first tested it on the "Squall" supercavitation torpedo back in the 1970's. This weapon technically tips over the known ideas relating to submarine warfare given that a supercavitation or supercav torpedo is many times faster than conventional torpedoes and gives the firing sub a longer threat range.  The website's content is pretty slow in content update but the current content so far is pretty good. The site has a section outlining the matter of a supercav submersible aircraft carrier and the use of supercav sub fighters. The mention of supercav sub-fighters and glossing over the text, made me remember plenty the old workhouse of a sub-fighter in XCOM 2: Terror From The Deep, the Barracuda sub-fighter. It also reminded me well enough the Spectre sub-fighters used in SeaQuest:DSV 2030 Tv show. CG graphics with underwater scenes are pretty great to watch, especially Blue Sub 6 in an episode where the Blue Fleet HQ was attacked by the mutants, most of the attack scenes were done in CG, courtesy of Gonzo. A non-CG reference to underwater vehicle shows would by Gerry Anderson's Stingray. Yep, the same guy responsible for Thunderbirds, Mysterons from Mars and Capt Scarlet. Too bad, I never considered such concept to be used in the old campaign days in high school. I never thought it be so cool in such an enviroment. Some of sub-fighters models in Deep Angel are capable of flying through the air to degree. The only thing lacking in the site is the kind of weapon systems to be deployed and used in the so-called Supercav age of this future navy.  Anyways, it was a fun look at that site. I guess an aquatic planet may be part of the travel destinations from the Twilight Empire sidestory Blaqueguard may prove interesting. :)

      About time that temporary comment script error have gone away.  *Cues in Monty Python segment from the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie with the phrase "..and there was much rejoicing." *Wooden unenthusiatic "Yay" heard.*  Blog operations can now resume. I'll post a new entry soonest since I'm tired from today but a forthcoming blog entry the next day will make up for it.  *Yawns and go back into doghouse after waving nighty-night and bye-bye.*

       *Sounds of drilling, hammers banging and miscellaneous working sounds in background.*  Darnit. Blog's futzing up since yesterday. Will look into it and hope it stabilizes.   *Minutes later.*  Isolated the problem. Its my comment script and the server it is calling to is having errors or server related problems. Had to disable the comment function until it functionally again. If worst case happens, I have to replace it with new code from some other comment providing site.  Talk about tech breakdowns here. :(

      Not much thought preoccupying my mind right now to fill any new entries at a consistent pace. Things here at home were rather..interesting. My mom's back after a weeklong stay at my brother's place to tend to his firstborn until they can handle things themselves and the health of the baby boy is satisfactory, which it was thankfully. The temporary absence of my mom kinda affects things in my freedom of movement ability here to leave the house. Its a security concern basically while another matter is the housekeeping thing. Such changes happen in a home.  Still websurfing and checking emails so far. Currently playing Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel (FO:BOS for short)on PS2. This game is shrouded in controversy by the franchise being distorted by its parent company, Interplay. The Fallout games, Fallout 1 and 2 were pretty solid RPG games in a no-longer realized post atomic holocaust setting. Fallout Tactics follows similiarly like 1 and 2 but more of a tactical kind of game. This latest game is entirely distanced a bit from the established universe that is loved by its supporting fans. FO:BOS majorly irked the loyal fans of the series for its being a water-downed rushed game that is also a vehicle for advertising a trendy drink rich in caffeine.  Despite the cries of outrage, I played with the game just for enjoying it as it is, a game. The mention of game companies laying off personnel and shutting down its associated studios is pretty much a prevalent corporate thing. Even in the case of Wizards of The Coast for shuffling and shutting down the arm connected to the Legend of The Five Rings RPG and gets assimilated into AD&D as a setting. Quite a sad turn of events, all the downsizing of companies with creative people sacrifices said creativity to turn out an impressive product. Anyways, I'll better attend to adventuring back into the wasteland and eliminate some mutant ghouls and such.  *Wanders away from the doghouse. Sounds of inhuman screams, laser fire and pistol fire surround the air.*

      Still in a writing slump. Haven't resorted to the so-called means of guerilla writing due to bouts of procastination. Creativity levels are not at peak yet. But something else was prodding me enough to go about soon after obtaining my long-waited monthly fix of NewType USA. The conscience prodding came about while sticking around with AEGIS people on the recent montly open meet they had. March ender's meeting and rounds of stories are a bit lean in some respects but one incident I've heard got me good since it was a bit synonymous with my current situation. That and some new eyecandy to look at with the soon-to-acquire new issue of NewType USA.  Onto the reason behind the title of this entry. Just recently acquired 3 new games for the PS2 last Saturday. One of the three games needs to be replaced since it doesn't seem to run. Defective game in question was Seven Samurai 20XX. The other two games that work is  urlLink  X-Files: Resist or Serve   (XF:ROS) and The Suffering. XF:ROS is regarded by some game players as a Resident Evil or Silent Hill clone but the draw of the game is in a number of little details that would appeal to X-Files fans.  Storyline for it starts off as innocuous at first, Mulder and Scully investigate a number of murders in Red Falls, Colorado. Scully and Mulder were discussing about the possible merits of witchcraft in the case given what scant info they have about the possible perpetrators, a pair of teenaged girls. The rest of the "episode" proceeds with the discovery of zombiefied townsfolk, Mulder's psychic visions and subsequently the discovery of the so-called "black oil" in the area. The game actually comprises of 3 "episodes" with 2 acts per episode. You can play as either Mulder or Scully and see how the story handles on parallel tracks.  All the voices in the games are done by the cast of the tv show as well. Lone Gunmen (Byers, Langley, Frohike) are present as well as Cigarette-Smoking Man, Alex Krycek, Assistant Director Skinner and Marita Covarrubias to lend their presence and voice in the game. The story covered in these 3 "episodes" are more or less estimated to be within the timeline of around Season 6 on upwards given the obvious references of the alien ship fragments discovered in that season, mention of the black oil as early shown in Season 4. The TV series may be over but the game itself has enough immersion for one to go through it again.  "People rising from the dead and taking cheap shots from behind is just bullshit." - Mulder (Cutscene in XF:ROS)

      Title of this post kinda reads off like a David Lynch TV series by-line, eh? Not exactly. It was something of a unexpected commentary that I haven't recalled or mentioned for some time regarding female characters in the comicbook universe.   This was initially prompted when I read an essay regarding John Byrne's treatment of women in a number of titles he penned and pencilled through the years. I read that essay at   Zan's Super Page  . The Zan site is an excellent site to look up matters regarding Superhero Gaming. I read the  urlLink essay  in question under the title "Don't Do It To Me Again!".  Reading said article kinda struck me as to how there was an unspoken issue of maltreatment of female characters, superhero or not, in those past years or more so in the present time with the way over-the-top writers in the industry do it. The end of the article indicated to me another linked which was the aptly named  urlLink "Women In Refrigerators" . It piqued my curiosity until I saw the reference behind the title.   It was the last two pages in an issue of Green Lantern, of the Kyle Rayner bearer kind, who arrives back from somewhere and finds the remains of his girlfriend stuffed in a refrigerator. I recalled enough then it was Major Force (Of Captain Atom fame) who did the grisly deed. It was a shock when I read that issue. It was also startling to think that a female companion of a superhero would be killed and placed into a kitchen appliance. It would have been more shocking if it were orchestrated that hero arrives home, finds no one home and goes about his business, till he needs some ice and finds a severed head in the freezer. *Shudders and shivers.* How's that for shock value?  Such violent and brutal times we may be living with such depictions of inhumanity and cruelty that manifest in today's current media and info-accessible setting. Of course, conflict is inherent in man's nature in order to survive and stuff, yadda yadda but does it have to be that the powerful have to step on the weak? Where's the humanity and justice in that? Makes one also consider in light of the political climate currently happening in the Philippines.  Its about time I got to find some coherence to write something noteworthy in lieu of being a human being and a comic afiocionado myself. More stuff along the way. Next time.

      Still at a snail's pace for the meantime. Not that enervated yet to tackle the writing task of the meantime. Haven't got in touch with something that would kick me into gear to go about it.  Presently, my room is currently not a good location to go about the typing since my niece uses my room, which happens to be her one-stop primo entertainment area: larger space than her room, a PC, VCR and PS2 as well. Only my dad's DVD player has the spot for DVD entertainment matters.  The end of my niece's schoolyear also heralds a 3 month or so lack of privacy and long nights since her bedtime is extended to god-knows-when at her discretion, short of a direct order from her lola.  These things kinda gets under my skin and thoughts with the overbearing presence of a privacy lost for the meantime during my niece's waking hours or presence.   I might have to set things up involving the use of my sister's laptop, which she entrusted to me for the meantime.  I'll go about composing more coherent entries next time while sorting out things here at the home front.

      Whoever reads my blog would have noted lack of any activity since the March 4 entry. This is on account of my being a shut-in for the duration to go about writing up the remainder of my backlog of written stuff promised to a friend of mine. Progress-wise already at rounding up tail end of Episode 5 on my campaign chronicling.  Wasn't able to plug away much text, since I had to be reminded again as to the bulk of backlag I had to do and the amount of text called for. The other matter that crept in was the arrival and temporary stay of my sister for around 2 weeks. She tends to use the comp I log onto the Net for her to check her emails and E-bay items for my brother. Compounded matters is with my niece's preoccupation with the offline version of Ragnarok Online and the occasional use of the comp as a DVD player. No way I would shorten the lifespan of my PS2 for that purpose.  My creativity well is kinda dipping low for now and I haven't been in contact with people of late that can provide me the drive and energy for it. I'll be looking forward to another visit at  urlLink  Vinnie  's shop for my latest fix of NewType USA.

      Somewhere in Germany...  A figure descends down into a secure room. The figure's weight held by a single shoestring thick strand woven out of monofilaments. The figure stops inches above the floor and in front of a glass display case.   "Vesper in position." She maintains a steady height over the floor, which is loaded with pressure sensors. Her entry route bypassed the main web of lasers that fill the room.  "Copy Vesper. Victoria, proceed with security system disable. Go." Sho and Devon, inside a van parked outside of a mansion, away from prying eyes of roving patrols and security cameras.  Sho was designated team leader for this op for Excelsis. Devon was acting as secondary observer and extra hand to doing the C3 chores in the van. But like all Excelsis operators go, they all work and fight in the name of God and their patron saints.  "Why we have to do the sit and wait while the girls get the fun?" Reynard asked. He's up in a nearby tree, watching the perimeter of the mansion's front with binoculars and a sniper rifle next to him. Ghillie suit over his Excelsis-issued combat suit.   "The ladies are better suited to get in and do the job. Leaving guys like you and me to deal with the mess if things go wrong." Gregor responded over the comm, watching the rear side of the mansion's perimeter.  Reynard's and Gregor's video feeds are showing a clear view off the mansion. The van's interior shows a number of viewscreens that shows the video feed from Reynard's and Gregor's point of view. Vesper‚Äôs video feed is also present. One of the screens show a real-time overhead view from a patched-in satellite feed in geosynch orbit that was hacked and tasked by Excelsis techs for the mission.  Victoria hears the order, though she's playing the role of torchlight singer at this instance. She finishes her song and announces to the guests of the party that she has to take a break. She leaves the ballroom and covertly proceeded to the security room without attracting any undue attention.  Victoria made quick work of the guards in the security room by using a flash grenade miniaturized into one of her earrings and quickly KOed all of them. She was unaffected by the high candela light by having flash compensating contact lenses provided as well. She makes a quick look to insure no other hostiles are present.   She sees that no other guards are present. She quickly recognizes the panel she needs to disable. Victoria spies Vesper on one of the cameras. ‚ÄúI see you Vesper. You must be slipping dear.‚Äù  ‚Äú I can‚Äôt account for the camera angles on my entry.‚Äù Vesper defends her skills as an infiltrator and thief seriously.    ‚ÄúVictoria. Vesper good to go?‚Äù Sho inquires her. Devon‚Äôs eyes move from screen to screen to double-check what may be overlooked by the other two operators at the mansion‚Äôs perimeter.  ‚ÄúVesper‚Äôs good to go on the snatch.‚Äù Victoria replied back with a slightly cheery tone to it.  ‚ÄúOkay Vesper, proceed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúCopy. Retrieval of target object commencing.‚Äù She extends her arm out to the display case and a small laser was deposited into her hand. She proceeds in cutting a hole through the thick glass. Minutes pass by. While cutting the glass she notices a rather peculiar and grotesque looking statue in one corner of the room.  Devon notices the selfsame statue on the video feed from Vesper‚Äôs camera. He furrowed his brow at what he glimpsed. Devon rewound a section of the feed and isolated the image. He had the image referenced for identification to the Excelsis archives back in Hungary. The search will take a few minutes to process.  Sho looked at Devon making the query. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù  ‚ÄúSomething about that statue in the room is bothering me. It wasn‚Äôt accounted for during the planning of this op a week ago.‚Äù Devon kept a critical eye on Vesper‚Äôs video feed.  ‚ÄúNothing we overlook we can‚Äôt handle Devon.‚Äù Sho assured Devon. Throughout their many years operating as a team, there was nothing they couldn‚Äôt handle. If it‚Äôs something over their heads, they have their faith to carry them through the worst of it.  ‚ÄúI got the artifact. Preparing to exit the room.‚Äù Vesper announced after extracting the object from the case. The object in question happens to be an old stone tablet.  As she securing the tablet on her person, she started to ascend. There was some subtle movement. The statue shifted and moved to look at Vesper. (To Be Continued...)

      Things have gone far again enough to break the camel's back this time around. Its quite a shock to get such on my email tonight. I've come to the realization that there are limits to one's patience and consideration.  Email I checked really got me in the gut as something I have dreaded yet anticipated on its inevitable import to me. It was more like being shot with a 10 gauge shotgun at close range with either choice of solid slug or anti-personnel flechette with its entire payload expended.  I'll not get into the exact content or wording of it. Its suffice to say that its an equivalent of getting a termination notice from an employer, even though I'm unemployed for sure. To be more correct, its more of a termination of a partnership as well as contract with something.  It pretty much presented a paradigm shift of some import for me as to some of the steps I'm doing with my life and how to conduct things.  A few more life-changing incidents of this sort would get my life sorted out as well as affecting my perspective on things as a person.  It still boggles me as to my current position in life, which is yet to be described or directed to and how I am as an individual.  I have to proceed with whatever plans or actions I need to undertake for myself. As another friend of mine told me earlier: "Some things happens as a means to grow and move on with things no matter what hand you are dealt with." Its not exactly a verbatim quote but it follows along that line.  As my other friend were to look at it from the outside and towards the big picture of it, its a path presented in this tapestry of life that is to be undergone in order to grow and improve. I feel more of it as regret as to the current decisions I have made with my creative outlet on this blog and newer associations with other people. Admission of guilt matter with those mentioned decisions would be conveniently described "wanderlust" and my current distraction-prone nature as of now. My channels and focus are not exactly what they are now compared to say 11 years ago involving a now obscure comicbook title called "Flashpoint".  I wonder to myself at this conjecture as to my interaction with other people who're more responsible, creative and successive than the current deadbeat that I am of late. Does my presence get any improvement as I bask in their presence? One of the possibilties that niggled my mind out of guilt is that: Does it forsake or neglect those I have associated in past for so long that it becomes rather routine?  As I look at it from the outside, I do see a need to socialize and experience something new outside of the normal routine I've been in the past decade or so. This is also of note as to how other people have changed and moved on in their own respective paths.  As I have noticed nowadays, there is a major wave of creative talent getting their projects up and running while the past glories of old are now gone and in the shadows. Myself, on the other hand, ain't exactly on par or equally talented as a writer or artist for that matter. I feel more like the most isolated element outside the fringe element for sure in obscurity, capability and talent. Any potential? Not sure. Many questions of my worth are pretty much hanging and on the line in connection to my life.  Quite a downer to say for myself, yah? Its just me going into the metaphorical "pit" to wallow in my own pity and despair until its time to pick up oneself up and move on until something happens again to put us back into said "pit".  I will not linger and ramble much more on this matter. I'll have to do some part-time soul-searching to sort myself and my life after clearing out the burden first to get a more clearer view of things and looking to other people to help me through.  This is pretty much one of those "down" moments people say about it on the wheel of life.

      This was something brought up after reading a series of posts on a forumboard item found  urlLink here . It was a rather obvious sign as to how heroes in comic books are depicted and moreso idolized and patterned from. It seems to show that some of the more popular comicbook heroes would be of the amoral kind, the ultraviolent kind, the antihero kind.  Its like the current generation now say that the era of four-color heroics are long gone and the ideals it perpetuate is now outdated. The most obviously noted example that brought it to the forefront would be The Authority comic series. Earlier comics, especially independent titles would present anti-heroes in all manners of genders and formats. That is excluding comics produced by so-called "men's magazines" and Heavy Metal since it doesn't involve much stories pertaining to superheroics. Besides the comics that present them, another contributing factor to it would be the writers making the scripts and plots for them, especially the kind into over-the-top, in-your-face manner of presenting shock value scenes of depicting explicit situations or violence.  At least as far as the current status of so-called old school heroes go, they still have life in them and prove that they still have what it takes in spite their so-called ideals or rules or engagement are considered old-fashioned, outdated or touted to be stupid. Kingdom Come was one such example, a highly recommended read for its story and art. One other comic story came to mind, it was a Superman title, Action Comics I think, it had Superman pitted against a group of superhumans, patterned unmistakeably from Authority, called The Elite. They showed Superman that they have the upperhand and their methods are rather brutal and direct which gets the job done thoroughly compared to Superman's usual method and manner of handling things. Superman surprisingly proved them wrong by defeating them with the same ferocity and intensity like them but still not resorting to stooping down to their level. It was a surprise that Superman, no matter how powerful he can prove himself to be, he is always grounded down by his ideals and upbringing which makes him not above the law or humanity for that measure.  It goes further for me to think that this generation now see heroes as outmoded models of inspiration as compared to their preference to anti-heroes and moreso with villains that may or may not follow their own code of behaviors depicted by it. It might be a lot sadder to think that the mindset of evil is cool is what draws kids towards the darker paths to vice and later self-inflicted destruction to themselves and everyone if left unchecked. Case in point is that why most players in arcade fighting games always prefer picking a dark, evil-looking fighter just because of how cool it looks and how much more vicious the attacks they have in their moves arsenal that picking a good or weak character makes them feel less.  Looks my post on this one is pretty long. I may rant more about this on a future date. Next time.

      Just celebrated the belated birthday of a friend last Saturday. Rico was a guy who said that he's now at the same age as the Messiah about a day before Saturday. He requested the company of the high school friends circle of me, Vic and Rem. Though Steve was very scarce these days with no new news on him. It was an afternoon to late evening of food, softdrink and talking of stuff.  Vic and Rem were talking a lot of the high-school hijinks that range from the use water-filled paper balloons, paper bullets propelled by rubber bands, the so-called "Flying T", toy parachutes and stories of petty shop-lifting and other foolishness. High school and grade school stuff really harkens the most obvious truth as to the difference between us and the later generations, entertainment and reasons for fun were simpler and harmless. Lessons were learned as well as the memories.  High and grade school stuff with some occasional post college happening talk seems to point out an obvious thing, our generation to say back then is more into clean fun than the obvious vices and attitudes we now hear and know on media. Technology was also an issue that affected how young people go about their lives and having fun. Email and Texting has become so abused in the manner of how it affects communication between people and tosses out courtesy and manners. That last bit I discovered all too well from reading someone else's blog.  It was also of note in our discussion for that day was about the common thread that got the group together, it was the lure and promise of a session of playing Dungeons & Dragons. Back then, the range of games available was limited and not catering to exploring mature themes. Nowadays there's a slew of Role Playing Games and related material which cover a lot more stuff. Magic The Gathering was pretty much considered to be an addiction of sorts on introduction here in the late 1990's along with the speculation market spurred in the area of collecting, whether it be basketball cards, toys or comics.  Some values we were accustomed to growing up having been superseded by hype and commercialization as if orchestrated by some grand plan of social engineering dictated for the coming generations to be impressed on. All presentation in media seems to validate what ever this social engineering plan calls for.  It would seem to fall more on parents more than ever to nurture and guide their children into the right kind of people, in spite what can be said otherwise by the currently dictated cultural and generational programming dictated by this ever-changing society.  I will post something next time in the arena of superheroes and current comic book culture which has some sensibility ties to this post. Next time.

      Noting how other blogs of my neighbors are going. I am a bit ashamed for not putting any updates of recent note since I had basically little to post for the meantime. Another thing is that I have to compete with my niece on comp usage since she either a)Logs onto  urlLink Neopets  to play there, or 2) Play some game on the computer. My niece is getting uber-bored or have a short attention span.  The Holy Week has come and gone after 2 weeks and what do I have to show for it, not much to nothing!!! Darn procastination and occasional jockeying for comp use with my niece. My room is the only place comfortable enough for me to go about typing on the comp. Haven't tried a good place to type using my sis' handed-me-down laptop.  Recent acquisition of games for my PS2 are: Alias, Cy-Girls, Drakengard, Resident Evil Outbreak and Crimson Sea 2. Alias is a must-have game for fans of the TV series of the same name. The story in the games happens in the framework of Season around mid to late part. Another hunt for Rambaldi devices abound in this one. Sydney also gets to settle issues with K-Directorate Agent Anna Espinosa once and for all. Cy-Girls is kinda like two games since it has two seperate discs which each have a tough, macho chick. One is a firearms expert and the other is a lethal kunoichi (Female Ninja). Resident Evil Outbreak is a newest RE game where you have to coordinate the survival of two other people besides your chosen character. Crimson Sea 2 is a good action sci-fi game which is a sequel from the XBox game, Crimson Sea. Drakengard is like this gothic fantasy epic game where you hack and slash, ride a dragon and do major damage with dragon breath. Drakengard's hero is rendered mute due to a pact he made with the dragon.  I'll post more stuff since I already scouted out some ideas and topics to talk about in the coming posts. Next time.

      Took me some time to think about posting something from what I recently read and later delved further for analysis. One such item was on reading 11 out of 12 issues of  urlLink Global Frequency , written by Warren Ellis.   Its a very intriguing and fascinating read to say about the premise of a world-wide network of specialists and regular people who handle situations that can range from something mundane and domestic to something that can be qualified like a case from the X-Files.  One bizarre yet sickening bizarre episode so to say was in Issue #9. It involves Takashi Sato, a former operator of the covert action variety. He gets pulled into a mission involving a medical facility without his consent. He was very adamant of being no longer involved with the organization but still gets dragged in. Talked about a no way out policy when you get into the group. As the story progresses, it was definitely a creepy tale of sorts that involves extreme psychotropic gas usage with extreme neurological consequences and bizarre usage of medical techniques and technology. It was a rather grisly story which ends on a not-so-happy note.  The unusual matter that caught my attention was mentioned by this line by Takashi Sato as he goes deeper into the medical research facility: "Taking me to a class of schoolgirls who committed suicide on a train last year wasn't enough?" and "You sent me to an island who had gone there to kill each other and turned on me--"  Those two lines automatically piqued something in my memory after going through a brief research spell into Japanese horror movies. Those two lines automatically made me recall which movies they were alluding to. The first line refers to the movie Suicide Club after perusing reviews  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . The second line mentioned earlier obviously points to the movie Battle Royale from reading reviews  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  How amazing some stories draws influences from other media. I guess some stories are retold or mentioned through outside characters, repackaged or retold in some other stories. My brain hits empty to further pull the train of thought to type more on this. But it should be enough for some interesting reading through the links I provided.  Speaking of links, I switched the locations of my Neighbors and Links section on my blog due to the gradual addition of links I have started to accumulate in provide interesting and relevant info. Hope it doesn't provide too much inconvenience. Next time.

      Already obtained the latest issue of NewType USA from  urlLink Vinnie 's shop recently. Stuck around to listen a new round of discourse and comments from  urlLink Dean  and Vinnie about the state of the literary world at present and the decline and disbelief with the sci-fi genre as somewhat stagnant due to the rock-solid hold of old guard writers and similiar pitfalls produced in the fantasy genre as well. Part of the discussion stemmed from this  urlLink article .  Being in such proximity with such an exchange of ideas provided the needed energy to use in going about my current writing backlog. A backlog that needs no further explanation, as outlined in my previous posts.  The approach of the latter half of Holy Week would provide me the time to write about up those remaining 50% of my backlog. After that, its up in the air as to what I intend to do or write next.  The time also alloted for the duration also gives me hopefully a chance for me to cleanup some piled up areas of my room every since I returned from Seattle back in Late November 2002. My mom has been on my case about it every few weeks or so and the ice is definitely starting to thin.  I got that intention now and have to make good on it as well. More stuff to hopefully follow soonest.

      Just got back earlier in the evening from having a second viewing of  urlLink Shrek 2  at the nearby SM Mall in our area of Bicutan. Seems I couldn't get enough watching the film just like how I did with other films that catch my fancy. One of the obvious things of note in that film is when Puss-In-Boots uses his "cutey-eyes" trick that is so disarming and so cute. This cat definitely earns the descriptor "kawaii" indeed. ;) This is what I mean:         Awwwwwww...nice kitty     Blog writer's note: I'll keep this image up for a while since the method done is rather...questionable to say the least. So this image will have a limited engagement.   Alternate link to seeing the kitty's pic is  urlLink here .  The majority of the review on this movie is done by my friend  urlLink Vinnie 's blog. It a good watch I definitely say.

      The home comp's OS is starting to succumb more to entropy as the damage done by this malware over two weeks ago. My plan of initiating a restoration was a failure since I haven't figured out how to manually initiate it.  Still able to run the usual functions, although with crippled shortcut functions still happening. The IE browser is giving me slight problems. It keeps crashing when I do some editting on my blog. Some program conflict or other doing it.  *Sighs*  I had to break out my sis' laptop to go about the job of doing the online blog edits. I just hope the window of opportunity presents itself in order to remove the comp problems once and for all. For the meantime I have to bear with this.

      Decided to try out a new template on this blog here. I was held off trying a new one from some outside site due to some coding incompatibilities. I'll make do with this one since Blogger happens to have some new ones. I'll still have to consider doing some minor tweaking when time and creative allows. Also tweaking some settings on this thing.  *Sounds of drills and hammers emanating from the doghouse.*

      Did some amusing digging on reading mention of a list of  urlLink Science Fiction Clich√©s  that was posted from  urlLink Dean's blog . That prompted to look up for other cliches of a similiar vein. Just found handful that can illustrate what cliches are seen in movies or books for that matter. These are:   urlLink Horror Movie Clich√©s    urlLink Another Horror Clich√©s List    urlLink The Grand List of Fantasy Clich√©s    urlLink Movie Clich√©s    urlLink Detective Fiction Clich√©s   Have fun reading through these lists. ;)

      Decided to put in this list of articles that illustrate a select few movies that evoke or depict aspects of cyberpunk beyond the immediate view of it. Its an interesting read.  The movies listed are:   urlLink Escape From New York ,  urlLink Blade Runner ,  urlLink Tron ,   urlLink Videodrome ,  urlLink The Terminator ,  urlLink Max Headroom ,  urlLink Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome ,  urlLink Robocop ,  urlLink Predator ,  urlLink Batman ,  urlLink La Femme Nikita ,  urlLink T2: Judgement Day ,  urlLink Sneakers ,  urlLink Nemesis ,  urlLink Leon ,  urlLink The Crow ,  urlLink Strange Days ,  urlLink City of Lost Children ,  urlLink Escape From LA ,  urlLink The Crow: City of Angels ,  urlLink Dark City ,  urlLink The Matrix ,  urlLink Unbreakable ,  urlLink The One   The above list and articles were taken from the  urlLink R. Talsorian Games  Website.  Reading these articles also puts some interesting facts to light on some matters of these movies' stories which were editted out due to some consideration or other in those times during production. It really puts whole new spin at looking for research material for a cyberpunk atmosphere or plot ideas.

      This problem on my comp has been attributed to an infamous culprit, a browser hijacker. Its basically a nasty piece of malware that attacks your browser by exploiting the known weaknesses of Microsoft's security holes in its browser and OS. These nasty digital landmines happen when one access websites of questionable nature. Whether out of curiosity or accident, its bound to lurk somewhere to assault an unsuspecting websurfer.  Secondary possibility is that a program I recently downloaded and run planted the malware and browser hijacker and screwed up some aspect of the comp's OS as well. At least the comp is not totally rendered inoperable just takes a lot longer to access the application programs directly since the shortcuts to them are rendered useless.  Still looking for ways of fixing this program monkeywrench out of my comp. I'll keep posting away as I can.

      Not much to post but was supposed to post some stuff I planned on posting but the recent week or so have been sidetracked by the file catalguing for burning into CD backup prior to restoration measures to the hard disk.  Another sidetrack consideration is my niece's recent acquisition of a YuGiOh PC game where she goes about playing it for about hours on end, if she can. She even goes about begging me to backup the game data since she didn't want to lose the data where she already acquired one of the five cards that summons Exodia, most powerful monster in the YuGiOh, besides the so-called "Lord of Cards" monster cards that was revealed on the local TV before it got rescheduled and restarted.   I'll get around to more posting any more entries when ideas and time will allow soon. Next time.

      Just got back from watching  urlLink Van Helsing  a bit after lunch time. The online reviews I read about this movie is pretty mixed for opinions about the extensive amount of CG used, mention of lack of character development, the usual cries and groans synonymous with a recently released movie  urlLink Hellboy  in terms of such failings.  Enough on the possible slew of critique that possibly color this review. In spite being a loud, 2 hour view, it was quite a ride as I would put it. Some of the scenes and characters on the screen would be screaming or moving towards the viewers head on, hence the mention of calling it a ride.   *Spoiler mode on*  The movies starts off without any opening credit or intros and straight to the opening scene with Castle Frankenstein and its residents to be lynched and sieged by angry Romanian villagers. The following scenes in it would be all to familiar to most monster movies fans. The slight twist is that the main bad vampire, Dracula was the sponsor to Dr. Victor Frankenstein's project. The story of the movie gets set a year after the destruction of Frankenstein's Monster on the burning windmill.  Scene shifts to Van Helsing in Paris, he was on the hunt for Dr. Hyde. (Strains of  urlLink LXG  anyone?) Van Helsing go through a failed round of negotiating with the brute which escalates to the use of gun, tojo blades and a grappling hook pistol. After the botched bounty on Dr. Hyde, Van Helsing returns back to report to the Vatican. This little scene reflects that Van Helsing is actually a field operative for some covert arm of the Vatican that operates in secret. It kinda have the strains of LXG, given a slideshow briefing for Van Helsing and workshop area filled with gadgets and stuff being crafted and tested. Its like a late 19th-century equivalent of Q's department from 007 fame. Speaking of tech, there is some toy factor in the movie for Van Helsing to use. An autofiring crossbow for starters, the concealed Tojo Blades (Looks like flywheel operated mini-buzzsaws) and the usual standbys of twin revolvers and shotgun.  Van Helsing and faithful tech-support Friar Carl (Feels the a synonymous strain with regards to a certain espionage agent and optech person from a certain TV series. ;) ) head over to Transylvania to assist Anna Valerious in overcoming Dracula's scheme.   The rest would be left little to explain. One scene involving the masquerade ball in Budapest shows something reminiscent of Blade II, the use of a powerful "light" bomb of sorts, intense enough to illuminate the entire castle the ball was held. Said castle filled with vampires. No need to figure what happens.  The climax of the entire ride so to speak is the mano-to-mano fight between a Wolfed-up Van Helsing and Dracula in his hybrid human bat likeness. Of course, the familiarity of Wolverine comes to the fore in this movie, given Hugh Jackman played the feral Canadian mutant in the past two X movies. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious shows a tough yet vulnerable heroine slightly different from her previous vamp movie,  urlLink Underworld . Of course, Ms. Beckinsale also seems to join along Keira Knightley, of Pirates of The Caribbean fame, as a recent corset-wearing beauty.  Basically another high-octane, SFX/CGI-fest of a "check-your-brain-at-the-door-movie". Don't expect any high value in terms of characterization, plot or development. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

       *Advisory Mode*  Just have to let my readers know that I'll be initiating a long period of cataloging and archiving of the computer's files I have residing  in the hard disk. Some program I downloaded and used rendered all shortcuts inoperable. I had to do a period of catalog and archiving. After that, files are to be backed-up into CD since the CD-writer software wasn't affected. This problem reminded me of a previous problem many months ago which required a lengthy transfer of data since the Win98 OS was rendered inoperable due to registry problem issues. I'll just post along as to new development until I get the comp's hard disk restored.

      Watched a relic of the 80's film Saturday with my dad. It was an unexpected find for my dad when he bought it on noticing the "Collector's Edition" label on the DVD, though bootleg it is. The movie in question is  urlLink  The Last Starfighter  .           The awesome looking Gunstar of Rylosian Design, a CG experiment using a Cray Supercomputer for its rendering    The premise of the movie was straightforward and kinda thin, a teenage boy who wanted to leave behind his dull trailer park roots when he graduates high schools gets his hopes dashed but keeps seeking his solace in playing the Starfighter arcade game. Unknowingly, the game happens to be a so-called Excalibrate Test conducted by the game's creator, who happens to be a intergalactic con-artist, Centauri.  Centauri goes about convincing Alex Rogan into the joining the ranks of other starfighters to defend the Frontier from Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada. Alex was bewildered and confused with this reality presented to him and opted to go home. Alex subsequently changed his mind after a brush in with a Zando-Zan Intergalactic hitbeast, courtesy of Xur and the Ko-Dan Armada. Seeing Centauri hurt and prompted by his android stand-in, he returns back to a devastated Gunstar base brought about by Xur's treachery and terrorism. Alex is now teamed up with the remaining navigator to pilot the only operational Gunstar to bring the fight to the Ko-Dan Armada at the Frontier's edge. Alex's Beta Unit stand-in had to keep alert for further assasination attempts on Earth.  Navigator Grig explained to Alex that this prototype Gunstar is slightly different in certain performance respects as well as the inclusion of one particular weapon system yet to be tested. The weapon system in question would be used to full effect for one scene.   Alex, having gotten his fear and performance anxiety out of the way, puts up a good fight on knocking out the communications turret on the command ship to cripple the deck fighters' communications. After sniping away at a couple of deck fighters in some passes, the Gunstar gets really surrounded by the enemy. This is where the best part of the movies shows, *drum roll.* the use of the untested weapon system.  The weapon system in question is called the Death Blossom. As I recall from the dialogue and from the novelization of the movie, the Death Blossom basically allows 60 seconds of overfiring all the weapons available on the Gunstar. Of course, the opening of 4 hatches or petals as it was called, brings in additional weapon arrays and launcher to fling energy beams and ordinance into the fray. Its a visually impressive scene to see the Gunstar gyrate gyroscopically in place while shooting off missiles and energy beams to obliterate the huddled mass of fighters in its firing globe.  Gunstar, though close to nil power, was able to outmanuever the command ship and take a few potshots before the command ship meet its end with a collision course with a moon.    The movie rounds up all in all with Alex being awarded for his bravery and faced with the prospect of teaching a new generation of Starfighters to rebuild the Starfighter Legion. Alex of course, opted to pick up someone back on Earth and say his goodbyes before undertaking the position. He gets to go back to Rylos with his girlfriend and then end credits.  The movie was ground-breaking as it raised the bar more in terms of CG effects with reference to an earlier CG heavy movie,   Tron  . The Gunstar in question was created as a set of blueprints and subsequently scanned into a CG model using a Cray Supercomputer to do all the animation work and such. This also covers for the other CG objects in the film. The story regarding the CG production called for is located  urlLink here .  Tron was more of foreshadowing to the cyberpunk genre as compared to Last Starfighter which is a wish fullfillment for a videogamer. I mean this movie has enough allure to the teenager in us to have such a fantasy happen in such wild circumstance. I mean how cool it was then to go to the stars because of your great adeptness with a videogame you play?  I'll review another old 80's movie soonest when I have time.   *Bleeps and other digital sounds emanate from the doghouse.*

      The mention of the the word, glaive, would bring some familiar memories of those who watched this movie back in the 1983 and besides the more correct term known by D&D enthusiasts and fans of medieval weaponry and armor. The movie I speak of is  urlLink Krull .  The movie was rather maligned by current generation movies fans and those of the jaded set. In spite the negative criticism about it, I enjoyed the movie when I saw it the first time.  It was a British-made movie and it was made in a time before such excessive innovations we know now as CGI. The SFX had to be done the hand-crafted way and the old camera tricks. It was a very good effort in terms of production though admirable and small compared to the current kind of productions major budgets are shelled out.  The story in Krull is rather simple and derivative. A Prince and Princess of two separate  kingdoms were to wed but Princess is abducted by the Beast, who resides in a fortress that moves from place to place after every sunset. Prince Colwyn has to go about the quest of obtaining the mythical weapon called the Glaive to aid in his quest of rescuing the Princess Lyssa. Colwyn later acquires quest companions Ynyr, Ergo The Magnificent, Rell The Cyclops and others before they finally set upon the Beast's fortress.  Opposition presented to the band of adventurers come in the form of the Beast's soldiers called Slayers and changeling assasins. The Slayers are rather impressive cannon fodder to see in film and makes quite an impressive to one such as me when I was young. Slayers are equipped with cool weapons which fire laser bolts and easily turned over into hand blades they wield for CQB (Close quarter battle) encounters. It was cool to see them fire those laser bolts and wall crawl the castle walls in their raid scene. Of course, the D&D geek in me would place such a weapon as a combination of +1 /+2 blade with an integrated wand of magic missiles in it.  Changeling assasins in one segment of the movie have a good suspenseful touch especially how one was able to kill one party member and so close to killing Colwyn.  A good scene in there has to do with how Ynyr had to seek aid from the Widow of The Web. It has a large crystal spider that accosts those that trespass its web or one who has given up the mantle of being Widow of The Web.  The closely visually impressive scene with SFX is the firemares scene. The group has to make use of firemares to reach the Beast's fortress in time of sunset before it moves again. It was rather spectactular to see though it can be better down with current generation SFX tech.  The movie is a cult classic to a number of people who fondly remembered seeing it. The movie was maligned as a copycat of Star Wars in terms of certain elements. Added further comparison injury is the recent appearance of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Krull is a movie that incorporates sci-fi and fantasy elements into one film. The other thing is its a very poor way of judging a lot of fantasy movies from then to now since they follow a number of fantasy elements and followed archetypes and similiar frameworks known in all fantasy literature.  I am very much looking forward to Krull again on borrowing the VHS copy from my bro when I have the chance.   *Looks proudly at the Glaive mounted on his doghouse's wall.

      Seems to me I'm not the only who got hit by some manner of illness or other.  Started out Thursday for me with a bad round of sneezing spells. It compounded further by Friday when it definitely triggered an onset of asthma and also a brief bout of fever. Luckily it was actually a slight one I got. Saturday, I still felt lousy with asthma but the fever is gone. Sunday, all I got left to contend with is coughing and some sticky phlegm in my throat.  The strangeness part that occured through this happened in the early morning of Saturday. Given its a tricky business for a bit to get a good position to sleep with asthma, I have to shift and change every couple of minutes to keep comfortable. A little turnning and moving of position in bed happens. I was starting to hear voices in my head as I do some of these sleeping position changes that point in time. At the start, the voices were indistinct but after a while longer the voices clear enough to be intelligible. They just speak out of entreaties to me of comfort as I shift into a different position to gain some comfort to rest. But a little later after that, the voices were debating as to having some top position among them. I somehow isolate the voices coming my respective directions on my person. That is my head is North, feet is South and so forth. After a while of deliberating from 4 directions from myself, center, east,west and south, they agreed on doing something else to do. East and West is always in agreement and working together. South was more bolder than Center. As to what they agreed upon on doing, it was pretty much a grim topic, something to do with humanity. I can chalk up the topic came about from reading issue 12 of Global Frequency by Warren Ellis.  The craziness that happened on Saturday has to do more with the old TV in my room not turning on. My dad tried to have it fixed but it seems that the potential cost of repairing its power supply is beyond the stated limit he quoted to the repair guy. So my dad bought a new TV for my room. Added crazy quirk was that the VCR ended up a smoking black box since my dad plugged it into the wrong outlet since my dad was puzzled with the plug layout under the desk here in my room and we forgot that the VCR runs on 110V as compared to the other items plugged in are at 220V. Good thing a capacitor burned out and no further damage happened to it. The VCR fiasco cost my time of watching the 2004 MTV Movie Awards but I'll try to catch it again on the rerun within the following days when I catch it.  I hope my weekend turns out a lot better than this one. Next time.   *Rests a bit easier in climate-controlled shelter of his doghouse.*

      Been watching my decent fill of TV shows back in Seattle in 2001-2002. Most of it attributed to Cable TV, basic package or otherwise. By around 2002, I started to notice something about some of the shows offered on the major channels. Its the slew of "reality" shows I have come across since the passing mention of it from reading my brother's zentertainment email though zentertainment is no more.  I have never yet watched the well-liked " urlLink The Truman Show " starring Jim Carrey, but it appears more prevalent now that most shows would follow such a format. Whether it be a date that clicks or not, an exploration and confrontation of one's fears and moreso which deserving talent stays or not by high-standard judges in the entertainment industry or by the number of votes phoned in, the truth has been apparent: The viewers of early 2000 TV are hooked on so-called Reality TV.   No aspect of everyday living is considered spared from the gaze of public fascination through the lens of the video camera. Whether they be mundane domestic concerns in any setting or in controlled enviroments the cameras takes in the interaction and scenery within reason of one's privacy allowed. Moreso that it harkens the sci-fi idea of a society under close surveillance 24-7/12-365 by an omnipresent government. Its kinda like Big Brother meets the Matrix in a way.  The US started churning these shows given that the viewers are out looking for the new thing since everything else is "been there, done that". It was just a unexpected stroke of success they have doing these shows that are like looking into a fish bowl, a hamster cage or an ant farm. Its like a more involving version of a documentary that's more dynamic than its clinical treatment done on the subject matter. People would see emotions, the snide remarks, the whole enchilada if possible within the standards of decency or not.  Such explorations with "reality tv" have been done to a lot of effect in sci-fi and other milieus in terms of parody or a social commentary. I mean the stuff so far we have at present are pretty tame and safe currently but what about when shows later on show real suffering and violence like televising the hunt of a convict-contestant where his/her price is freedom and some other rewards. The catch is that the contestant is pursued by hunters of all stripes to indulge their skills and bloodlust. This premise was used in some sci-fi books, videogames and while back in the Arnold-starrer "Running Man".  I guess entertainment have gone through both range of the spectrums from "virtual" to now at "reality", though virtual shows are not fully realized yet but the leaps in technology would allow it happen soon. Reminds me much of Max Headroom and the many virtual idols made in Europe and Japan. Very much a reminder of Virtual Light, Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties by William Gibson of Neuromancer fame.  I just hope that the state of entertainment doesn't spiral down on account of looking for the next big thing to catch the viewers' attention.   *Turns off the TV in the doghouse.*

      My fascination with some of these zombie flicks stems out of the initial impression of fear I have when I was young on seeing their trailers back then for any horror movie or moreso with gruesome effects. I built up some tolerance for it now given how my bizarre fascination on hearing the wild and fantastic stories connected to the horror genre, within a certain level of tolerance.  Some books helped me along with that as well as plus the mystique and fascination brought in by the Cthulhu stories. What got me drawn further in was the emergence of these "survivor-horror" games on the PS1, especially the mention of Silent Hill and Resident Evil series though I played the RE series in reverse due to thesequence of procurement at the time.  I guess the steady viewing of those episodes from Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Tales From The Dark Side built up my tolerance slightly. Those shows that deal with the unknown also added it further: X-Files and Psi-Factor pretty much adds it in further until it makes me sure I'm ready, whether it scares me crazy or not. Of course, my fear of ghosts kinda sticks since I got unsettled by this joke pic about 2 years ago.       Ghost stories or movies pretty much put me on edge after watching such. I guess some movies would have an impact on you and gets known by your friends to be used for certain effect. Ghosts and associated wraith-like entities like in the category of Sadako from Ringu or those in Fatal Frame 1 and 2 scare the daylights out of me while doll or mannequins unsettles me less than the earlier mentioned ghosts.  My dad now tells me I have to stay away from such things since it was sticking into my head and freaks me out at times, moreso when my niece would exploit that fact to get even with me. She does here impression of Sadako at times and given how the stereotype of evil children sticks in most minds of people, it kinda heightens the edge of fear with it.  Sometimes my mind would play tricks in my mind given my prior exposure to PS1 games Silent Hill, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis and the Hellraiser-esque RPG Kult. It makes me see a brief scene playing in my head at times that draws on previous exposure and things familiar to me from everyday things.  Enough on the thoughts of scary for now. Onto other topics next time.  *Closes the door to the doghouse with a brief lookaround of caution.*

      Just got back earlier from watching 2004 remake  urlLink Dawn of The Dead . It was quiet a shock of a viewing experience for me. It was just as unsettling when I watched before  urlLink 28 Days Later  a few months ago.  It seems to me that the current generation of zombies now in movies are the fast moving variety with the standard lethargic gait in non-chase mode. Its still a given that zombies sense and home in onto live normal humans for them to feed and further the spread. Kinda reminds that attribute point aspect from All Flesh Must Be Eaten RPG, "one bite and you're hooked".  The movie gets into the thick of the zombie menace as the first 10 minutes would put it. Just compared to the 1978 version, the  DOTD happens to be a remake of the 1978 version done by George Romero. The version back then was a social satire about the commericialism aspect of society in the US. It was loosely retained but seems to more on the matter and realities of survival with such a gruesome scenario to happen in anywhere, anycountry.  The movie was rather much also the depiction of the human condition when faced with survival issues of such bizarre magnitude. At least a part of the movie relieves a bit of tension and gloom that pervade the earlier part of the movie. It just boggles any sane viewer as to the matter of figuring a plan of reinforcing a pair of mall shuttles with aluminum siding, barbed wire and some other add-ons which pretty much harkens back to the improvisation days of The A-Team and Macgyver.  Of course with the human condition matter brought up, the slightly off-tangent matter has to do with the dog (Yay for Chips the dog!!! ^_^) in the movie. Its current master goes into the thick of the deadheads in the streets to attempt a rescue of the trapped canine that prompts 5 men to go in bail her and the dog out with one casualty. It also upped the timetable for their departure since the inevitable overrun occurred.  In this case for a horror movie, the ending didn't turn out so cheery, especially if one sits through the ending credits. It was just an open-ended yet grim outlook given overrun with zombies where humans used to be living normal lives.  Makes one think: If such a thing happened here and you made it out of your home in one piece, which mall would you go? With whom for that matter?  Unexpected thought provoked eh? I'll tackle a similiar matter on my next post.  *Secures the doghouse and loads up his guns.*

      A bit delayed as usual for me to post a new entry for this blog. Without further ado, here goes.  I have never got into writing an entry that relates about something negative. What I have stumbled on made me think otherwise.  It all started by a search engine query for homebrew paper-and-pencil RPGs (Role-Playing Games and not the explosive ranged munitions used by rebels and other known military milieu.) I skimmed through the search result and encountered mention of this review  urlLink here ( *Blog writer's warning: Clicking the tubgirl link on that page would lead you to a very disgusting picture, its very disgusting for me not to elaborate.*)   The earlier search through the results page also mentioned another badly done RPG called Senzar. I recalled immediately purchasing such a book at CQ Megamall many years ago. It basically gathering dust in my cabinet. In retrospect I never realized that I'm among those of the morbid curious. What's to expect with spare cash on hand and taking a chance?  One of the loudly argued RPGs that is categorized with the bad kind of RPGs is Rifts by Palladium Books. The complaint directed at it was the derivative rules akin to early edition AD&D, 2-3 decades prior to this Microsoftesque RPG system called D20. Rifts was also considered to a munchkin/powergamer's playground given the multitude of characters classes and moreso the "kewl" powers/abilities and the massive toybox to use, especially when you have a small library comprised of the many sourcebooks and worldbooks that contain the extra stuff.  I take a step back at reading mention of this accusation of munchkinism and powergaming. Munchkinism(Earlier known as Monty Haul Campaigns.) was more relating to overpowered and unbalanced gaming style done by the problem player or players that give the poor GM a major headache which problem sets his story off the rails or a merciful suicide shot to the head in a manner of speaking. I just say that I may be lumped in with such but its basically the GM's ability of rectify any random situation as best he can within reason or more so with deviousness to fix the problem. Powergaming is basically a phase of later matured and responsible gamers go through while under the misguided notion that the amount of freedom presented with a whole lot of power is fleeting and an illusionary crutch in the long run.  Now onto this nasty piece of work, Fatal. Like the title of the game says, it reads pretty....repugnant for the more intellectual and sensible of gamers. I read the reviews and cringed as to how poorly constructed and represented the games concepts and ideas go. I braved through the 20 Mb. download to see it for myself and its a shocker. Its a very misogynist game about hack-and-slash, poor use of historical and philosophical info, oozing with promise of graphic sex and other horrible things. I mean for Pete's sake, there is a character stat pertaining to how long and thick a male character's manhood is as well in the case of the females, size of the breast and width of the female orifice and how deep it is. Pretty racy stuff to say. This is definitely one game to keep away from young gamers for sure and moreso from impressionable gamers of whatever ages. This game is really bad that it can give RPGs a bad rep since those earlier inquisitions about RPGs back in the early 80's.  That's all for now on this post. I better sanitize the area from all this putrid stuff.  *Puts on a Reinforced Hazmat suit and goes about sanitizing the area with really strong chemicals and radiation.*

      More than half the week is over and its close to halfway through my training at my new job. The evening commute home from the office for these past few days are really getting to me in terms of exhaustion. The change in schedule currently makes my blog updates are bit more delayed. But nonetheless I'll press on with what I have on my mind.  Decided to get off the wall and somewhat out of the box with some crazy ideas that percolated briefing in my head. Crazy ideas are the more spontaneous variety as compared to the regular kind that would require some processing time. I'll enumerate them now.   Metal Gear Alias  - An interesting mix of characters and intrigue that's the trademark in their respective stories. How about combining both? It may be a bit overkill in terms of the espionage and action but it would prove pretty exciting indeed.  Certain creative liberties are called for to blend the respective plot hooks and characters to have a good blend from their respective stories. Solid Snake ("David") was sent in to the Shadow Moses facility to rescue important people there and assess the capability of the terrorists holding it. Mountaineer ("Sydney Bristow") was sent in given relevant intel pertaining to the terrorists involved and moreso on the retrieval or destruction of a device derived from a Rambaldi artifact that is to be placed inside a new war machine. Given that, their missions will definitely overlap. Besides Mountaineer and Snake teaming up, same goes with Marshall Flinkman and Hal Emmerich (Otacon). The support team would be just as interesting a mix, Father figures Roy Campbell and Jack Bristow for sure. Haven't done the full run down on the roster of characters for the full refit. As to the villains, I would toss it in that the group headed by Liquid Snake is actually sponsored by the Covenant and Julian Sark is present as well to oversee the operation along with Liquid, given that Covenant is well aware of Revolver Ocelot's involvement within the Russian SpecOps and Intelligence communities. Lauren Reed and Sniper Wolf would make a good tag-team of snipers to give a very hard time for Snake and Mountaineer. As to mysterious characters which are actually supposed dead people, I decided to go with Grey Fox and Sydney's ex-boyfriend turned spy/assasin Noah Berg and have them converted as cyborgs under the sponsorship of the Covenant. It would be quite a challenge for Snake and Sydney to take out Metal Gear Rex and a showdown with Liquid Snake and Sark.   Alias McBeal  - A really crazy idea of combining the elements from two respective shows. This is just a strange neurotic twist to the basic premise as well as putting some craziness in the routine world that we know. Sydney would probably be visiting Dr.Barnett more often than usual like 2  or 3 sessions per mission called for. Some crazy stuff is sure to happen and Marshall Flinkman would definitely have more comedy done to full effect for it.  That's about it for the meantime. Still have to adjust my sleep patterns to get some creative productive done. Next time.  *Spy music playing from the doghouse.*

      Going through training here with my new job. I wasn't called through last week. Forced my hand to go to the office Monday and managed to report in and get assigned with a training group and the rest is ongoing, not yet history. It was fun and entertaining training I would say in terms of the introductions among us trainees and trainer as well as the naming exercise we did.  The training schedule and subsequently, the actual job schedule would take some getting used to. But the rewards from the job would make things easier to go about buying things I want to buy and hopefully, acquire.  The creative stuff is not really on strong hold, just only when the right opportunity shows up here at training, then work. Of course, I'm sure enough to adopt the so-called guerilla method of jotting my ideas, though the actual writing task would be done later on when time is available.  That's it for updates for the meantime. I'll just keep on jotting and thinking when the opportunity for it shows.

      Just got back from watching " I, Robot " starring Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan and Alan Tudyk. Technically speaking, the movie was rather inspired and not adapted from the Isaac Asimov story as misinterpreted by the marketing people of the film, critics and fans.  Seems to me that any movie that supposedly "adapted" from a pre-existing book or other literary work is basically pre-written which may contain common denominator elements to the said work which is "adapted" and promptly go about obtaining the permission and rights to use it with some slight script write changes. The movie basically relies on the kind of brand name familiarity on account of the reputation preceded from its literary namesake. Its rather a common trend to note with most movies that touts to be an adaptation of story by >(any famous author's name)  Anyways onto the review of the movie. It has a similiar feel like  urlLink Minority Report  starring Tom Cruise in terms of presentation. The usual slick sci-fi eyecandy to be expected with the usual round of CG addon.  The premise of the movie revolves around the infallibility of the 3 Laws of Robotics which are:  A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  Of course, these three laws known in Asimov's stories later adds an another law, the Zeroth Law, which is basically an extension of the 1st Law where it encompasses humanity as opposed to the individual human.  These laws are hardwired into the construction of the positronic brains these robots use. The infallibility of these laws makes them safe, yes? Not exactly as played out in the movie.  The movie proceeds with Will Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, investigating a murder scene that possibly involves a robot, after he had brief paranoid episode involving a perceived purse-snatching robot. The murder victim in question happens to be the so-called father of robotics research for US Robotics. (Hmmmmm....first modems now they build robots for the world. ;) ) Detective Spooner gets teamed up with Dr. Susan Calvin, the murder victim's protege and fellow researcher for the corporation. They followed the trail of clues left by Dr. Lanning and later arrived to some startling revelation. Part of it lies in the fact of Sonny's construction and not-yet discovered purpose. The final piece to the puzzle was arrived at with Det. Spooner's arrival at the storage site for the now outdated Ns-4 robots and a clever round of questioning with Dr. Lanning's interactive holographic message prior to his death. It appears that the ultimate conclusion from the 3 laws of robotics would lead to robots overtly protecting man from his own self-destructive path with all means necessary. A revolution, Dr. Lanning puts it to be. That brand of logic is also what prompted the Sentinels in X-Men comics to go overboard with theri primary directive as to protecting humanity from mutants. The movie follows on later with some scene reminiscent of a familiar battle scene down in Star Wars, Episode 1 involving Gungans and Trade Federation Battle Droids. The action near the last 15-20 minutes or so. Sonny, though a virtual actor or synthespian did a really good job in doing robot combat against his fellow NS-5's robots. Pretty slick fighting I'd say. All in all, its can rate as a good popcorn-munching movie on this note.  I'll see about watching it again with my Dad when time allows.  *Styx song "Mr. Roboto" playing now from the doghouse.*

      Start of the week, going about the procurement of papers and things to wrap up my job application to my latest job. Some of the needed documents are present, SSS : Check, TIN: Check, NBI Clearance: Needs Renewal. I need to renew my NBI Clearance since I applied for it back in Nov. 1995, during my initial foray into looking for employment after graduating college then like everyone else.  I had a bad feeling about this renewal business since I figured enough the bureaucratic morass I had to navigate on account of my citizenship that time. Even with those new renewal kiosks that came along with the recent streamlining of the NBI's procedures, I still felt unsure of coming out relieved with this necessary procedure.   After waiting for like 2 hours total, it was my turn and the operator had a hard time having a barcode scanner read the scrambled barcode on my old clearance document. Took 3 times and it went in, sort of. I was subsequently told to report in to the main NBI office to further rectify the problem on my clearance. I had to hold it off till tomorrow since my Dad was busy taking my mom to the hospital for some follow-up consultation I gather after my parents recent medical checkup at the hospital.  The things I do to secure my job application for sure.  *Sighs.*

      Start of the weekend now. Been much away from formulating any blog entries of late. This entry covers pretty much something I haven't done for a while since I returned to the Philippines. It tackles much on the long-drawn ritual of job application.  This week was about the job application. Basically done in two phases, preparation and execution. Monday to Wednesday was preparation time. Thursday and Friday basically the application period itself.   Preparation basically covers the intelligence gathering matter of knowing what to expect in the interview and other details in the screening procedure. Armed with this knowledge, it provided me with a slight edge as to how to go about the application.  Besides the intel gathering, I also had to prepare my attire and purchase whatever's needed to round up said attire. Luckily, majority of my attire was taken cared of back in Seattle and I get to use it for this occasion. Just a purchase of an undershirt rounded the entire set. Clothes and application inside info, check. All set to go.  My Dad picked up my cousin, Chester, since he's the one who provided us the inside scoop on the application process in the company he's working in and the one I'm applying to. Dad drove me over to the RCBC Plaza Building in Makati. Impressive s looking building on first seeing it meself.  Me and my cousin trooped inside and took an elevator ride to the 18th floor and go through the waiting game. Of course, the usual writing in of forms done in lieu with the waiting. The preliminary interview and screening started around 11:00 or so. The interview was done by one interviewer and seven of us applicants. A rather different method in my opinion. The interview went through fine and since it was a prescreen interview, it felt to me like something out of a reality show like American Idol or America's Next Top Model. The prescreen interviewer, Princess, mentioned me and three others passed while the other three had to be let go. I was briefed way earlier that the interview was actually a test on how good one's English speaking skills the potential applicant has. I have no problem with that along with the diction and accent for it. Survived the 1st round.  Second round was to follow a little later after lunch for the phone simulation test. Lunch would be in order. My cousin gave me the brief tour towards the eating places inside the RCBC Plaza Building. I'm rather impressed that it has a decent foodcourt. Quite a place for me. Lunch done, back to the waiting game till my turn to take the simulation test came up. It was a rather straightforward test involving two readings. One reading involves a set of tongue twisters, which I felt I stumbled at the start but the others were more manageable to pronounce through. The second reading involves reading out the names of the US states in correct form. No biggee on that part.  After the tongue-twisting and state naming, another round of waiting follows for Round Three: the IQ test. The IQ test was rather different since it was conducted on a PC. The drill for it goes about answering X number of questions in a very small time frame of say, Y minutes. It wasn't exactly a big thing I was told by my cousin. So the final interview schedules was set up for us for the following day.  I arrived on time for the following day's schedule though an unexpected twist came about as to my seeming non-appearance when my interviewer, John, was trying to page me in. I decided to play it patient throughout the proceeding in spite my initial projected plans for that day was wrap up the application here and head over to  urlLink Vinnie 's shop in Megamall for some kibbitzing. Of course, given the situation, the second part of the day's activity was rather pushed far back. After around past 2:00PM decided to accost an HR person as to my status for the final interview. Also repeated that around 3:00PM. Luckily it was Princess I inquired as to the final interview. She located John and my interview proceeded in earnest. It was bit of a miscommunication and partly I guess on my preoccupation in reading Peter Hamilton's Fallen Dragon and listening to my CD player I brought to make the long waiting bearable to be the culprit I reasoned. Regardless all the waiting paid off.  I'll not bore you with the details in the final interview. I did well enough in my response to his questions that he endorsed my application to one more HR person, Nico. It was fortunate that Nico mentioned that he is straight-forward person in these interviews and I responded promptly enough since it would be more comfortable and honest enough to go through it without any ambiguity with the interview. Nico was slightly surprised as to my patience as opposed to other applicant who show irritability and impatient in light of things.  I would like to note that when you get interviewed by those who were geeks or have an inner geek inside them, it helps a bit when they mention something of a geeky topic noted in your resume or response like keyword comics, computer games or PS2, then some talk or response on said keyword helps in the interview process as far as the positive reaction modifier calls for. Never thought encountering younger geeks than myself would be of help in the employment process.  All in all, I passed the final interview and now on my way to joining the ranks of the employed, which I've been away for a quite a while. At least a steady flow of economic units into my holding would be nice and moreso of restoring my ability to do the occasional impulse purchasing at Vinnie's shop and other places. It was a busy week indeed.

      Took a while to compose the entry regarding my recent weekend. I was kinda tied up playing a comp game called Space Rangers. Other circumstances that kept me from composing was: occasional lapse of I-net service, adjusting sleep pattern and occasional out of the house bit to go to SM Bicutan for some scenery change.  I'll keep you posted for anything to write about.

      My recent Saturday was full of sudden decisions for me, mostly turned out good. I decided to drop by  urlLink Vinnie 's shop to visit and also hearing about the sale the shop's having. I was partially aware about the event called Free Comic Book Day or FCBD for short.  The day later got me loaded down with a lot of freebie comics that Vinnie's shop received for the event. Quite a haul for the likes of me and other people like  urlLink Dean ,  urlLink Nikki ,  urlLink Carl  and others in Vinnie's circle.  One decision matter was sticking around with Vinnie and company for dinner. It was conducted at Dampa Sa Libis. It was feast of lobster, prawn, tilapia and inihaw na liempo (pork), the last item is out of place with the other seafoods but it was a welcome additional for those who may not have the systemic tolerance for it. Anaphylactic shock is a serious thing since I recalled my bro landed in the hospital after failing to notice that the fried rice he ate with his then soon-to-be wife happen to have shrimp, which he was extremely allergic to.  The feasting happened proper after the dispersion of the freebie comics loot among the gang. It would take a bit of reading through to have any reviews about the titles we have received. But all in all, it was a fascinating window to see how the comics scene goes in mainstream and independent publishers.  After the feasting, the gang decided to head over to Double Deck for few rounds of drinking, since its the place with the cheapest beer in the area. Majority of the gang had their beer while I had to settle for can of Diet Coke and Charles had a bottle of Cali Shandy. I just find imbibing alcohol, especially with a very long interval of not ingesting it would be uncomfortable. I usually end up getting itchy, warmer than normal and occasionally get a headache or too though sometimes my thought processes or motor control would get impaired.  As the drinking wears on, the gang gets to enjoy the music from the band Split Point.  Andrew  got to sing a song as well as  urlLink Carl  given how much the gang wanted to clinch the victory of singing prowess for our table. The musical sparring ended at a stalemate.  After all the drinking and listening to music, the gang called it a night. I was fortunate enough to survive a very early morning commute and a walk home without incident though the fear lingers. The only downside to the entire proceedings was to arrive at the gate of the house with my dad awake and waiting. I figured the delay in communications was my blame as far as initiative is concerned. The other consequence of having to get water two days after that since the following Sunday night's water gathering was scarce.  The following Sunday, I woke up late and was able to catch up with my parents in their room as they were watching a movie, on DVD, called  urlLink Japanese Story  starring Toni Collette and Gotaro Tsunashima. The movie was like part scenic road trip, part character interaction piece and some romance in it. Of course, the movie's ending didn't end exactly in a cheery note on account of Gotaro's character's death due to accidental circumstance, it pays better to look where you jump into a swimming hole. The way this movie plays kinda reminds me enough of the movie,  Lost In Translation  given such similiar manner of a placing stranger in a strange land kind of deal. As I said earlier, Japanese Story ends in a tragic note.  But all in all. It was a good weekend.

      Just came across an article while having one of my break periods at training for my new job. It started to make sense after 2 viewings of " I, Robot ". It was a rather startling revelation for me, since it makes some sense as why I get unsettled with mannequins occasionally and digital ghosts in games. The  article  I came across presented to me an explanation. After reading the article and some spare-time research, I got a better picture of this feeling we may all have. Its actually a phrase called " The Uncanny Valley ". This phrase was coined by Japanese Roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1978.  Mori discovered this phenomenon after conducting experimentson gauging psychological reactions of humans to robots with the emphasis on anthropomorphism, movement and appearance. The initial trend was basically a positive slope, which is the better level of these three qualities, the more we find them pleasing and comfortable to be with. It sounds good but the phenomenon manifests somewhere to a point in which the plotting of the graph dip deeply to negative. This negative trend indicates that at some certain level of any of these three qualities, the admiration would turn to revulsion. This unexpected negative trend in a seemingly supposedly positively sloped graph is what created this valley in the plot. The graphs showing this is located  here .  The article hints a bit that when a robot appears to be 99% human, our human sensibilities would try to seek out the missing 1% on account of a sense of wrongness we would recognize.  This psychological response also accounts as to how we perceive things in the visual mediums. This accounts how people can be amazed or appalled at watching/viewing digital analogues of human beings when done up differently for movies and games for starters.  As to visual mediums with illustrations of humans, this articles say this as:   "Comic-strip artists have known this for years. As comic-book theorist Scott McCloud points out, we identify more deeply with simply drawn cartoon characters, like those in Peanuts, than with more realistic ones. Charlie Brown doesn't trigger our obsession with the missing details the way a not-quite-photorealistic character does, so we project ourselves onto him more easily. That's part of the genius behind modernist artists such as Picasso or Matisse. They realized that the best way to capture the essence of a person or object was with a single, broad-stroked detail."   But this psychological hurdle is currently being challenged currently by David Hanson with his  robotic head project   It was a rather startling revelation in our human perceptions and psyche when it deals outside the usual human interactions we know. Its also a sobering thought as to how future will be heading as such.

      I figured enough from now on to prepare my blog posts as a draft first before setting it up as permanent post. Some editting and added stuff would be done to the draft version before making the post live. This kind of dawned on me when I was writing my soon-to-be-latest post since it had a lot of research and URL links put into it that sometimes, the train of thought to write would get muddled. I opted to go about trickling down the text until its fully considered finished.

      Stupid way to get the web browser made integral with a computer's OS. On account of some attack by a virus or malware, it really mucks up the works since its workings are doubly affected.
