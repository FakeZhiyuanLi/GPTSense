      我有中文朋友2年。女孩好朋友不是女朋友。她想要我与她结婚。2个月我考虑与结婚想法。我认为好想法。我想要帮助朋友。与她结婚，做她的成员我的国家。与她结婚，要做她的成员我的国家。我没有女朋友，她有男朋友，我认为问题。现在，我的女朋友考虑妻子，认为的没有爱"温暖愉快的事" 与她。她没有认为这件事。我尝试没有象她。我不做。现在整天我哀伤。

      Rochelle brought me flowers, she is in at the moment. I asked her why she brought me flowers and her reason was just because. *melt* I'm a fag and I love flowers, that's my weak spot fo sho! Are you listening chick from Alias? Flowers and doobies are how your going to win my heart baby!!!  Work sucks I need a day off. I've only been here a few hours and im already having homocidal-erotic thoughts about cutting people. I'd look DAAAAAAM fly as a ninja with whirling blades(tm) of death flying through the air using my super awesome ninja powers to cut peoples heads off!    urlLink    Real Ninjas! Sweet!&nbsp; urlLink     Mouhahahaha!!!!!!!! The Real Ultimate Power!!! My name is Boungey Woungey Wu Robert and I can't stop thinking about ninjas.  These guys are cool; and by cool, I mean totally sweet. These guys will fuck you right up!  Facts:  1.    Ninjas are mammals. 2.    Ninjas fight ALL the time. 3.    The purpose of the ninja is to flip out and kill people.  Weapons and gear:  Ninja Sword Ninja Stars    Ninja Outfit  Testimonial:  Ninjas can kill anyone they want!  Ninjas cut off heads ALL the time and don't even think twice about it.  These guys are so crazy and awesome that they flip out ALL the time.  I heard that there was this ninja who was eating at a diner.  And when some dude dropped a spoon the ninja killed the whole town. My friend Mark Abernacky said that he saw a ninja totally uppercut some kid just because the kid opened a window.  And that's what I call REAL Ultimate Power!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you don't believe that ninjas have REAL Ultimate Power you better get a life right now or they will chop your head off!!!  It's an easy choice, if you ask me.     Ninjas are sooooooooooo sweet that I want to crap my pants.  I can't believe it sometimes, but I feel it inside my heart.  These guys are totally awesome and that's a fact.  Ninjas are fast, smooth, cool, strong, powerful, and sweet.  I can't wait to start yoga next year.  I love ninjas with all of my body (including my pee pee).      Q and A:.  Q: Why is everyone so obsessed about ninjas? A: Ninjas are the ultimate paradox. On the one hand they don't give a crap, but on the other hand, ninjas are very careful and precise.  Q: I heard that ninjas are always cruel or mean.  What's their problem? A: Whoever told you that is a total liar.  Just like other mammals, ninjas can be mean OR totally awesome.   Q: What do ninjas do when they're not cutting off heads or flipping out? A: Most of their free time is spent flying, but sometime they stab.  (Ask Mark if you don't believe me.)

      Last night Rochelle and I went out for din din's after work. We went to a Thai resturant just around the corner from my house. Let's sum it up shall we? Crap. The end.   urlLink    Just round the corner from my pad yo.&nbsp; urlLink     Afterwards Rochelle came over and we surfed the interweb together hahahaha 24 port hub hooked up the the wifi router in my room. You never know, 24 hot chickys with laptops might wanna stay over one night hahaha. Anyways yeah she came over and man I just don't like her like I used to. I started getting all irritable and shit when she was getting her hug and kiss on. I was getting all like grrrrrrh and angry and shit. And I just don't know why. Then we hopped in bed to watch a movie and she wanted to snuggle up to me and crap and I started faking being tired just so I wouldn't have to, man, I don't even wanna get my jiggy on no more! like there aint no freak action man! Anyway once again just like EVERY time I stay the night with her I got a SHIT SHIT sleep. Next relationship I get in im asking the chick if she snores first. If she does, im not going to get into it. Serious. I don't care if she is Mrs Right or what, fuck that!!! I'm going loopy through lack of sleep.

       urlLink    This is my mate Byron. He is pretty much the most amazing person out there I know. I seem to attract people like him and this dude never ceases to blow my mind! If it's not plots to over throw the local goverment (it's going to happen!) or teaching me what food is good and what is not (isn't it sad to think that us as humans no longer know through instinct what we should and shouldn't eat, have we unevolved???) oh man tangent where was I. Oh yeah, Byron is fucking cool man, every society has people like Byron, people who make you sit there and *actually* think about who why and where we are. Everyone can learn stuff from guys like this. If I had it my way I would have him up for mayor not bloody blandergirst or whatever her name is. BLOODY GROUSE MATE!!!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    So yeah today is a pretty average day, nothing much exciting going on, nother day nother dollar type of thang. I saw Lan *and* Jenny sitting together at lunch time haha. Ever get that feeling that you have done something bad and shit, like people are talking about you? hahaha a yeah well I got that feeling hard out. Lan was touched my knee and I think Jenny was spocking out on that. What's up with the pictures below? I got bored at work so decided to go to the chat rooms. I said "show me your boobs" and look what got sent to me. The internet is a strange strange place! Chalk another one up for Yahoo! Chat and the telepathic hypnotic moneyshot(tm) magical powers! The girlfriend is coming over tonight and we are going to a thai place to eat dinner then watch a movie I think. It is not that I do not like her, just, well, we are both going our own ways in life at the end of the year. She really is the nicest girlfriend I have ever had! But it is just not working, also I have feelings for someone else. sigh.  那么呀今天是一相当平均天，没什么令人激动的继续，其它天其它美元类型事。我看见了Lan 和雌鸟一起坐在午餐时间haha 。曾经得到您做了坏事和shit 的那种感觉，象人谈论您? hahaha 一呀好我得到那种感觉坚硬。Lan 被接触了我的膝盖并且我认为雌鸟spocking 在那。怎么样图片如下? 我得到了乏味在工作因此决定去聊天室。我说"显示我您的boobs" 和看什么被得到送了到我。互联网是一个奇怪的奇怪的地方! 创造另外一个为雅虎! 聊天和传心术催眠金钱被射击的(tm) 魔术的力量! 女朋友今晚过来并且我们去泰国地方吃晚餐那么观看我认为的电影。不是我不喜欢她，，很好，我们是两个去我们自己的方式在生活中年底。她真正地是我曾经有的最好的女朋友! 但这不有效，我并且有感觉为某人叹气。  &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The internet is bloody fantastic.

I think with my stomach hahaha. I'm going to go to Sweden one day and knock on her door and ask her what is for dinner. Linda always says things like this to me:  Linda* says: Tack, jag mår bra. Hur mår du? Jag skulle jättegärna vilja ha en öl också, men jag skulle nog bara somna på direkten då tror jag. Jag skriver mail till min kompis, vad gör du?  Linda* says: Jag ska gå och lägga mig nu för klockan är snart halv två på natten, det är sent. Jag måste packa vidare imorgon, lite jobbigt. Mitt rum ser ut som ett slagfält och jag orkar inte! Jag har inte ens kommit hälften på två dagar! Kom och hjälp mig!  Hoppas allt är bra med dig iaf och att det är fint väder i Wellington, vilket det förmodligen inte är eftersom det är maj. Kram och Godnatt.   I have no idea what it means but I am sure it's something good haha. I love Linda!!!!

      Stay in school kids, life get's complex and difficult quick!        I think I can sum this up in a simple form. But the situation is complex...  I married Lan to help her out because she is my friend. I did not tell my girlfriend because I didn't think it was a big thing (ha!) and she did not tell her boyfriend for the same reason. Now that we are married I am developing strong feelings for her. She is also developing these feelings for me. She has a boyfriend I have a girlfriend.  Houston we have a problem!

      Coitus interuptus from work dagnamit!      Yeah so anyway I married Lan and then continued on living my life and didn't see her for a few weeks after it. Then she came into work one day to say hello and OMGGGGG! It was all different! All of a sudden I looked at her in a way I had never ever seen before. My mental thoughts went something like this...  "OMG I MARRIED A HOTTY! DAAAAAAAAAAAMN!"      I don't know why but I had never ever looked at her in that way before. My friends had, but not me. Ever since that moment a few months ago I've been very attracted to my wife. Hahaha that sounds so mental but you know what I mean. And the problemo is...      I have a girlfriend, her name is Rochelle and she is simply wonderful. Oh and my wife has a boyfriend, he is a retard hahaha. But seriously, im married and have a girlfriend. My wife has a boyfriend. See the problem... arghhhhhhhhhh!!!!

      我叫Confused...      So about 2 months ago I married my good friend Lan. Lan is a lovely girl that I have known for about 2 years. She is from Harbin, China (linkage at the bottom) and has been living in New Zealand for about 4 years or so now. She was Lena's best friend.      I married Lan because she want's to become a Kiwi (and who can blame her, our country is teh shiat! omg r0xoR!!!111 haha) and do the whole immigration thing. I had months and months to think this over. Finally I decided yah mon I shall do this. Short of perhaps donating a kidney or other internal organ this is probably the nicest thing I could ever do to help someone. So we did it. Jono was my witness and oooooh can't remember her name, some girl was Lan's witness. It was the most nerve racking experience ever. I was in the little room shaking like a mofo and Lan was nervous too. As to be expected, fraudsters! hahaha. Lan started forgetting English (she speaks better than me normally lol) and I was shaking and my face was red. We had to turn, hold each others hands and face one another. Just like on TV we were staring into each others eyes telling each other we would look after ech other in sickness and in health etc etc etc... I'd never even held her hand before or anything lolz!!! We didn't kiss at our wedding, that must of looked mad mad dodge. After all "we are madly in love getting married spending the rest of our lives together" or something. Formalitys where taken care of and we signed our souls on the dotted line and bang, simple as that, married. Afterwards we all went out and had Yum Cha for lunch. Mmmmmmmh Chinese food, yummyyyyyyy!!!       If only it was that simple!!   urlLink     urlLink

      It fucking goes like this man, Japanese men are all wankers hahaha and Kiwi's have big dicks  mmmmmmmmmk! -------------  urlLink    Your average Japaa not taking shit from no man, uh uh you are NOT the boss of me short dick man!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Good this be a reason why? &nbsp; urlLink    ------------- No sex please -- we're Japanese  USA TODAY      To an astonishing degree, the sexes are going their opposite ways in Japan. Young women are revolting against the traditional role of obedient housewife, opting instead to live at home and shop and socialize with girlfriends. Startled men are retreating into solitary ways. Check-ins at the country's famed 'love hotels' are even falling. As birthrates slip, a social crisis looms.  TOKYO -- Junko Sakai was nervously looking forward to a romantic getaway with the man she'd been seeing. But when they arrived at a seaside hotel last fall, her beau requested separate rooms.  Stunned, Sakai nonetheless anticipated a late-night knock on the door. It never came. ''Nothing happened,'' the Tokyo writer says.  Nothing is happening with depressing regularity between Japanese men and women these days. Marriages, births and hanky-panky are all spiraling downward with troubling implications for the nation's future: A sagging birthrate means that fewer working-age people will be around to support a growing population of elderly; a social crisis looms.  Only in Japan would a popular weekly newsmagazine deem it necessary to exhort the nation's youth to abstain from sexual abstinence: ''Young people, don't hate sex,'' AERA magazine pleaded last month in a report detailing a precarious drop in sales of condoms and in business at Japan's rent-by-the-hour ''love hotels.''  More and more Japanese men and women are finding relationships too messy, tiring and potentially humiliating to bother with anymore. ''They don't want a complicated life,'' says Sakai, who has written a controversial bestseller, Cry of the Losing Dogs, on the plight of unmarried Japanese thirtysomething women like herself.  And so, to an astonishing degree, men and women go their separate ways -- the women to designer boutiques and chic restaurants with their girlfriends or moms, the men to karaoke clubs with their colleagues from work or the solitude of their computer screens to romance hassle-free virtual women.  ''Men don't want to spend time with their girlfriends, especially shopping,'' says Takayuki Mori, 40, a single man who works for a Tokyo advertising agency. He says he isn't dating.  Better educated, more widely traveled and raised in more affluence than their mothers, young women no longer feel bound by the Japanese tradition that says a woman unmarried after age 25 is like a Christmas cake on Dec. 26 -- stale. Men, meanwhile, seem intimidated and bewildered by assertive young women who are nothing like their moms.  As a result of the disconnect between genders, Japan, just emerging from a long economic slump, is experiencing a social recession in:  * Marriage. Japanese are postponing marriage or avoiding it altogether. Weddings dropped last year for the second straight year. Fifty-four percent of Japanese women in their late 20s are single, up from 30.6% in 1985. About half of single Japanese women ages 35 to 54 have no intention to marry, according to a survey in January by the Japan Institute of Life Insurance.  * Births. Just 1.1 million babies were born in Japan last year, the third straight decline. The average Japanese couple now produces just 1.32 children, well below the minimum 2.08 needed to compensate for deaths. As a result of plummeting birth rates, Japan's population is expected to peak in 2006, and then decline rapidly.  * Sex. In a 2001 survey, condom maker Durex found that Japan ranked dead last among 28 countries in the frequency of sex: The average Japanese had sex just 36 times a year. Hong Kong was next to last with 63. (Americans ranked No. 1 at 124 times a year.)  AERA reports that condom shipments are down 40% since 1993 (probably in part because Japan finally legalized birth-control pills in 1999) and love-hotel check-ins are off at least 20% over the past five years. What's more, an increasing number of those visiting love hotels aren't there for romance, AERA says; they've found that love hotels offer the cheapest access to karaoke machines and video games.  I won't get married!  Over tea in the sunlit lobby of the Akasaka Prince Hotel near the Imperial Palace in downtown Tokyo, and later over soba noodles and chicken yakatori at a nearby restaurant, Japanese writer and television personality Yoko Haruka describes the shortcomings of love and marriage Japanese-style. The husband works long hours and carouses into the night with his pals from work. The wife is expected to stay home, clean house and take care of kids. If the children behave badly, she's a bad mother. If her husband has an affair, she's a bad wife.  The author of Kekkon Shimasen (I Won't Get Married!), Haruka abandoned her own plans for marriage a decade ago when she realized her fiancé wanted her to give up her career and lead the traditional life of a Japanese housewife. She says Japanese men sometimes propose to women with lines like: ''I want you to cook miso soup for me the rest of my life.'' Not surprisingly, Japan's increasingly educated and well-traveled young women are not impressed.  ''I'm not expecting men will change,'' Haruka says.  Her assistant, Miho Higuchi, who has kept silent throughout the conversation, suddenly blurts out: ''Never again!'' A mother of three, she divorced her husband because he refused to do anything to help her clean house and take care of the kids.  In fact, Japan's divorce rate rose steadily to 2.3 divorces for every 1,000 people in 2002 from 1.3 in 1990; it appears to have dropped a bit last year, partly because fewer people have been getting married. (The divorce rate in the USA was 4 per 1,000 people in 2002. )  As for men, they seem bewildered by the rising assertiveness of Japanese women.  ''Men are getting weaker,'' says Takayuki Tokiwa, 23, a student at a Tokyo vocational college. ''Women don't have to rely on men anymore. They can live on their own.''  Masahito Wakauchi, 24, would seem to be a good catch. He has fashionably wavy hair and a good job with an advertising agency in Tokyo. Is he dating? Wakauchi shakes his head sadly.  ''It's very, very difficult'' to meet women these days, he says.  Rather than risk rejection or summon the energy to maintain a modern relationship, many Japanese men simply pay for affection in the country's ubiquitous hostess bars and brothels.  Others prefer virtual women online to the real kind. ''They seem to find the relationship cumbersome. . . . You have to be attentive to your partner,'' says Kunio Kitamura, president of the Japan Family Planning Association's Family Planning Clinic. ''A quick way to get satisfaction is so-called cybersex.''  In fact, as many as a million young men -- mostly teenagers, but increasingly older men as well -- suffer from what is known here as hikikomori. It's a condition in which they seclude themselves in their rooms for weeks at a time (though the causes seem to go well beyond fear of women to traumatic experiences from the past, such as being bullied at school).  But most young Japanese seem to enjoy the single life. In 1973, a Japanese government survey found that the happiest people in the country were those over age 60. A similar survey 24 years later found that the happiest people were in their 20s, and twentysomething women were the happiest of all: 77.7% said they were content with their lives. Maybe Gloria Steinem was right: Women need men like fish need bicycles.  Many young Japanese women live carefree lives, staying at home with their parents, paying little if any rent, letting their mothers cook their meals, clean their rooms and do their laundry. Many work dead-end jobs that don't pay much but don't cause much stress and give them enough spending money to buy designer handbags, shoes, clothes and jewelry and enough time to take overseas holidays with their girlfriends.  Emerging from the Louis Vuitton shop on Namikibashi street in the heart of the Ginza shopping district, Tokyo secretary Yukiko Matsumoto, 38, says she's happily single and living at home with herparents.  ''I don't want to change my rhythms,'' she says. ''Men expect women to stay home and take care of them.'' Not likely: Matsumoto travels abroad twice a year with her best friend and shopping companion, Terumi Yanagibashi, 38. They've already been to Hawaii together three times.  'Parasite singles'  A few years ago, Tokyo Gakugei University sociologist Masahiro Yamada coined the phrase ''parasite singles'' to describe young people who sponge off their parents and use their rent-free incomes to splurge on designer goodies, expensive dinners and trips abroad. It came from the 1997 Japanese horror movie Parasite Eve and applies to young, live-at-home men and women alike, though Yamada says the most carefree of the parasite singles tend to be women; the men are more serious about establishing careers and moving out on their own one day.  The phrase caught on. Some single women even printed up business cards defiantly describing themselves as ''parasite singles.''  In the past, it made sense for young people to leave home early. In the 1940s and 1950s, Japanese families were large. Staying at home meant sharing a room with brothers or sisters. But after decades of prosperity and falling birthrates, many young adults are pampered only children. Leaving home to marry means the drudgery of housework (especially for women) and the poverty of having to pay your own bills.  Sociologist Yamada says the single life in Japan isn't as blissful as it seems. For one thing, many young women still want to marry: They keep waiting for the perfect man -- a rich handsome guy who either helps with the housework or can afford to hire help. But Prince Charming never quite arrives. ''They hold on to the illusion they will find a man with a high income,'' Yamada says.  ''The good men are all married,'' writer Junko Sakai says. ''Those left behind are all nerds or without jobs or violent or not nice-looking.''  And what happens to the parasite singles when their parents become infirm or die? Yamada says their future is grim. He cites one case study that he fears will be a model for the future. A woman lived with her parents until they died, inherited the family home but found that her job didn't pay enough now that her parents weren't around to foot the bill for groceries and other necessities. She ended up bankrupt after borrowing heavily in a futile effort to maintain her lifestyle.  The phenomenon of parasite singles also is creating a demographic nightmare. Japan now has about four working-age people to contribute to pension plans to support one of today's retirees. By the middle of the century, there will be just two workers for each retiree, which will create huge financial problems for the country.  Yamada says young men and women need to get more realistic. Men need to start helping with the housework and supporting their wives' careers. Women need to stop waiting for the flawless man who's never going to show up. ''They've got to compromise,'' he says.  But it's going to take a lot of convincing to get Japanese women to give up their independence. Sakai says Japanese society still thinks there's something wrong with unmarried women over the age of, say, 30. She calls spinsters like herself ''losing dogs.'' But fewer and fewer women care about tradition. ''I know I'm a losing dog,'' Sakai says, ''but I'm quite satisfied with my life.''   urlLink    All women from nihongo are also Zelda *drool*&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    they are robots AND ninjas, the Ultimate(tm) life form! they can flip out and kill you for looking at them AND transform into cool shit(tm) transformers are japanese women also!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    GROHZ-ZRIAH was a japa woman, look what happened when men meshded with her!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    ******ALL******* japanese women are ninjas its a fucking fackt!&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Don't fook with JAPANESE woahman'ssssss they shit sushi and eat lightweight trucks for breakky yo!!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is what it looks like and with some penismite next to it for size comparison, it's about 20 cms long, just a tad shorter than my willy and consumes alot less juice. Battery life is about 5 hours when using the serial cable. It's alot less when pcmcia cards are in. I am getting a NIC for it on Moonday. Browsing the interweb with it's webbrowser is a bit of a hoe over serial. But it's cool that I can. Sitting in bed reading textfiles and downloaded books is pretty fly. Oh yeah mp3's compact flash card slot rah rah rah can you tell I love this thing? :-D&nbsp; urlLink

      Posting this BEFORE I forget it and no im not tripping but damn this is pure fucking genius and intend some work on this right away. I've often thought about developing a language from scratch. The more I learn bits and piece and general knowledge of languages and language systems I think to myself "there is somethign wrong here" hahaha yeah im fucking nuts hahaha. Languages have way to many individual symbols, punctuation marks and symbols and shit that just don't need to be there. Also not many languages are tolerable of what I like to call "SHIT" that is to say, words out of order, grammar mistakes, bad punctuation, bad handwriting, tones or use of the wrong tone and any number of things. I've been learning to speak Mandarin Chinese for over a year now, one wrong tone and changes the meaning hardcore.  Also I speak a little bit of Thai. Six tones, gender, age AND situation specific pronouns plus those funny words that go on the end of every sentence. Plus if you chop and change things around of course it is going to change the meaning of the sentence.   I propose this:    A new language from scratch. Containg only 10 written symbols and 10 numerals. These are also punction charecters. A language tolerable of bit errors, words of fixed length, sentences of fixed unit length or multiples of the unit size. No more than 3 unique symbols in a word, each words meaning can be deduced by knowing only 2 symbols of the word. Words containing less than 3 symbols will have bit padding. In it's written form each written symbol comprises of no more than 4 stroke. Verticle, horizontal, and the two 45 degree angle strokes. One or two dots dots above or below on one of the symbols in the 3 symbol word would be indicators of punctuation. More when I have learnt the terminology and vocabulary to describe what I have written down.      Benji (02:17 PM) :  I had a trippy thought last night when I was smashed :-D  Stephen K (02:18 PM) :  yeh bro wassat? Benji (02:19 PM) :  Designing a language from scratch, one that is extremely tolerable of grammar errors and even missing whole words. Kinda like a self CRC'ing language Stephen K (02:20 PM) :  cool Benji (02:20 PM) :  Because for example, Indo is like that, you can miss chunks out and you can usually understand. A 10 word english sentence might only be 5 words in Indo, it's trippy Stephen K (02:20 PM) :  compressed language eh Stephen K (02:21 PM) :  its amazing how the brain is quite tolerable to errors in any language Stephen K (02:22 PM) :  certain errors anyway Stephen K (02:22 PM) :  what would you call your language ? Stephen K (02:22 PM) :  Boungeynese? Benji (02:23 PM) :  I have seen a few similar type things on web pages, check this link out as an example http://ancientscripts.com/futhark.html and http://ancientscripts.com/ogham.html Stephen K (02:23 PM) :  japanese is not very tolerable Benji (02:23 PM) :  neither is chinese Benji (02:23 PM) :  Indo doesn't even really have plural, beat that lol Stephen K (02:23 PM) :  heh Stephen K (02:24 PM) :  all comes down to information theory Benji (02:24 PM) :  Ogham looks like a good candidate. Extremely quick to write, wouldn't matter wether your first language is english or anything else. Benji (02:24 PM) :  There is alot of maths to it, I think it really could be interesting Stephen K (02:24 PM) :  it would be a great thing to understand Stephen K (02:25 PM) :  you should be a linguist professor Benji (02:25 PM) :  I want to find the language with the minimum amount of unique charecters and work it from there, I think 10 would be ideal. Stephen K (02:25 PM) :  could be a good thesis topic Benji (02:25 PM) :  I love languages and the study of language systems, I learn alot here at work Benji (02:26 PM) :  I think more than 10 would be ineffcient, afterall, we have 10 digits.  Stephen K (02:26 PM) :  Ogham is cool Benji (02:26 PM) :  And in ancient hebrew the letters are numbers and vice versa.  Benji (02:26 PM) :  fook yeah :-) Stephen K (02:26 PM) :  very mathematical in design Stephen K (02:27 PM) :  geometric even Stephen K (02:28 PM) :  efficiency all depends on the human mind, how it relates to the language Benji (02:28 PM) :  10 numbers and 10 'letters' would give 20 unique symbols which has more than enough combination pairs to make any unique word or given meaning, and it would be fast. Listen to me, im not even stoned! hah! Stephen K (02:28 PM) :  first understand the human mind - experiment with drugs some more :-) Benji (02:29 PM) :  exactly, thats why it needs to be base ten, we count on our hands, why not read on our hands. Stephen K (02:29 PM) :  yeh Stephen K (02:29 PM) :  good reasoning I reckon Benji (02:29 PM) :  no more than 5 symbols for any one word, each hand is one word, im on to something here lol Stephen K (02:29 PM) :  I can count the alphabet with my fingers and nipples Benji (02:29 PM) :  if each word was a fixed size it would be very tolerable of bit erros so to say hehe Benji (02:29 PM) :  lol Stephen K (02:30 PM) :  is this sign language lol? Stephen K (02:30 PM) :  what about tone infliction Stephen K (02:30 PM) :  monotone, accented or not. Stephen K (02:30 PM) :  I always mistake the chinese "ma" Stephen K (02:30 PM) :  horse or mother Benji (02:31 PM) :  ma is also 'question' Stephen K (02:31 PM) :  not much CRC correction accented Benji (02:32 PM) :  I think all punctuation should be spoekn not inflected, so instead of a rising tone to indiciate a question as in english, if you speak a question the question mark should be spoken, same with all the punctuation. that way it is also more easy to understand. Benji (02:32 PM) :  no misunderstand people. the rest of it should be flat. well that is to say tones make no difference Stephen K (02:32 PM) :  yeh thats the japanese way Benji (02:32 PM) :  we both know what japa and chin is like lol Stephen K (02:32 PM) :  monotone, no inflection Stephen K (02:33 PM) :  only when you have sex should you be allowed to inflect Stephen K (02:33 PM) :  Haiii!! Stephen K (02:33 PM) :  haiiI!! Benji (02:33 PM) :  and no more than 4 lines in a symbol, otherwise it is to hard to write. compare runes to the bloody 23 stroke chinese chars lol Stephen K (02:34 PM) :  yer - i dont want to have to be a professor in chiniese characters to read a newspaper Benji (02:34 PM) :  I've been learning thai lately and god it is easily the most complex thing I have come across. Stephen K (02:34 PM) :  thai u reckon? Stephen K (02:34 PM) :  I was taught some naughty sayings, they seemed easy enough :-) Stephen K (02:35 PM) :  like, suck my dong you pro! Benji (02:35 PM) :  6 tones, gender, age and situation specific pronouns AND those words that go on the end of sentences. Benji (02:35 PM) :  your just memorising them lol are you understand them though lol Stephen K (02:35 PM) :  yeh thats true Stephen K (02:35 PM) :  not hard to speak, but to create a sentence from understanding would be hard Stephen K (02:36 PM) :  I did create some of my own sentences though which the thai prostitue found amusing Benji (02:36 PM) :  I was told Chinese would be hard, it so fucking isn't hahaha just the writing and reading is. Benji (02:36 PM) :  lol Benji (02:37 PM) :  I'm being courted by a Thai girl, she is fucking hot and her eye lashs are like shit an inch long im sure of it Stephen K (02:37 PM) :  lethal weapons Stephen K (02:37 PM) :  lucky you got protection Benji (02:37 PM) :  sure do, fake name haha Benji (02:38 PM) :  I'm going to chruch some numbers on Ogham Version B lol Stephen K (02:38 PM) :  hahah cool Benji (02:40 PM) :  I've got it Benji (02:40 PM) :  fuck meannnnnnnnnn I knwo how shit shit be Benji (02:41 PM) :  each word should be 3 symbols and only 2 of which are needed for the meaning and one symbol is to modify it. example sentence in english could be Benji (02:43 PM) :  Oh I so have this sussed, pen and paper time bye bye bye Stephen K (02:43 PM) :  hahah Stephen K (02:43 PM) :  i was waiting for the word Stephen K (02:44 PM) :  ¿¡ Stephen K (02:44 PM) :  (means I like pretty girls) Benji (02:44 PM) :  ok look at your hands, 3 groups of 3 words plus an extra bit. each 'word' has 2 bits plus a 1 bit modifier Benji (02:45 PM) :  10th bit is a modifier for the sentence as a whole Stephen K (02:45 PM) :  sounds like machine op code Stephen K (02:45 PM) :  00011000101 Benji (02:46 PM) :  but can it be brought down only 10 letters and 10 digits Benji (02:46 PM) :  first things first we don't need no stinking vowels Stephen K (02:46 PM) :  yh rkcn Benji (02:47 PM) :  xctly! Benji (02:47 PM) :  vwls r nt ndd Stephen K (02:47 PM) :  sck m blls Benji (02:48 PM) :  cn sy mr thn tht n 10 symbl mn :-P Stephen K (02:48 PM) :  RS! Benji (02:50 PM) :  even in the confines of english this system becomes apparantly more effcient Stephen K (02:50 PM) :  haah Stephen K (02:50 PM) :  uuuu crazzzy Benji (02:50 PM) :  1234567890 ilvazngirls Benji (02:50 PM) :  hah, room to spare Benji (02:50 PM) :  and I had an extra vowel Benji (02:51 PM) :  it's a bit of a worry trying to break up the words but if you know each word will be only 3 chars it's not a problem Stephen K (02:52 PM) :  ilvazngirls ? lol Benji (02:53 PM) :  and if there are words that are less that 3 symbols in length the extra bit or bit should be a modifier, say for example car, slow car, fast car, good car bad car broken car, burning car, all modify the object but not the sentence to much in meaning, that way aslong as you know the root word you can still read the sentence even if you can't understand the whole word Benji (02:53 PM) :  I love asian girls Benji (02:53 PM) :  im a fucking genius man! hahaha Stephen K (02:53 PM) :  there is a fine line :-) Benji (02:54 PM) :  gt 2 g bk 2 wrd  17 ;-) Stephen K (02:55 PM) :  heh Stephen K (02:55 PM) :  we all get a little crazy sometimes Stephen K (02:55 PM) :  others are just mature into craziness later in life Benji (02:57 PM) :  bah, im not crazy, I just know enough about languages and language systems to know that some are more effcient and logical than others and not many are tolerable of grammar mistakes Benji (02:57 PM) :  grammar needs to be removed from language damnit Benji (02:58 PM) :  ok, im off to work on it :-)
