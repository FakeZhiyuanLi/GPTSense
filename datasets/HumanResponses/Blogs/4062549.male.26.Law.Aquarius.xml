      Now that we have all been energized by John Kerry, does President Bush even have a chance of being reelected?

      Not quite sure how you all let this happen while Rachael and were frolicking through Asia but Galyans' stockholders have agreed to sell out to Dick's.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what happens on the northeast side of Indianapolis as you could hit a stiff 5 iron from the back door of Galyans to the parking lot of Dick's.&nbsp; Nothing like trying to beat your own prices I guess.&nbsp; And I thought Rach and I would be coming back to a more marketized economy, not a monopoly infested one...    urlLink http://www.indystar.com/articles/0/166205-2460-092.html

      The French photographer,  urlLink Henri Cartier-Bresson , died on Monday. Though I hadn't ever heard of his photos, I was intregued by the remembrance I heard on NPR. I found this album of some of his photos. Some of them brought tears to my eyes. they are THAT beautiful.

      The  urlLink allegations  coming out against John Kerry in the book " urlLink Unfit for Command " are eye-opening at the least. They present a stark contrast to the John Kerry we have all seen thus far throughout the campaign shoulder to shoulder with Vets at every rally. Yet, what do these allegations truly say about the candidate? Does one's willingness to exaggerate the facts and embellish his own actions take away from one's ability to lead? It seems a bit egotistical and ultimately it is lying. For, as the stories are showing, there were many other men out there that day Kerry supposedly "earned" his silver medal. It seems a leader would want to "puff-up" those around him rather than himself. It doesn't seem that this telling aspect of Kerry would serve the United States well in attempting to quell the unilateralism George Bush has created amongst the international community. Whether Kerry is boasting on his behalf or that of the United States is moot in a time where the U.S. could use a little piece of some future first lady's humble pie (instead of oatmeal-cherry-raisin-chocolate chunk cookies).
