      As Kahlil Gibran once said in  A Handful of Sand on the Shore  "Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be," and this will be one hell of a year. After sleeping a good 4.5 hours tonight, I awoke at 7:30, in order to get ready for (:0) "Early Drop Off." I loaded the van, a U-haul rental (19.95 per day in-town, plus mileage, mind you) with the items afore-mentioned in my other post. We parked on Wisconsin Ave., right in front of my dorm, with several other vans, pickups, a city bus behind us. After checking in, getting a room key, a cart (our dolly would have done the job, but not as quickly), my father and I finally got up to the thirteenth floor, and looked out at the looming city thought the window aptly placed right in front of the elevator. We opened the door to suite number 1343 and I noticed a rather large room, bigger or the size of my parentâ€™s bedroom, (more dimensions to come). Very nice window again, well air-conditioned, very close to elevator and common room, as well as nice, well-conditioned furniture and bathroom. Everything I'd expect from a former YMCA; for more info see "YMCA" by  The Village People .I dropped my stuff in the corner, noticing that my roommate had already taken one of the closest, the smaller one, and dropped his shit in the opposing corner. He has not been living there, I must have misheard him about moving in on the 22nd, or he meant he would be having the same experience I was having, that other day. I want to add that, while stumbling upon his closet (he had hung his clothes), I noticed most of them were in the size range of small to medium, mostly what I expected: a "Chris sized fellow." After dropping my stuff off, I didn't get much of a chance to check out the dorm, so more info on that tomorrow, but I picked up my ID at the Union, and headed off to the Apple store to get my PowerBook serviced and pick up an Airport Extreme (with newly acquired Edu. discount). We dropped off the van, and then took off to Ikea with Ken, for some extra accessories, and a loft for Ken's room. We picked up a nice stainless steel, or aluminum model (who knows?) and a rug for my cold tiled bathroom. In our efforts we managed to pick up, look around, and check out in about thirty minutes, a new personal record for both of us. However, packing was... more of an ordeal. After finding we had 3 boxes of varying sizes, we ghetto rigged a system of twine, supported by other boxes, and covered with the tarp, further accentuated with massive amounts of twine. This adventure took a grueling thirty minutes, after which we refreshed with two Slurpies(TM) from 7-11. After a 30-minute drive we arrived at Great America, for an afternoon of roller coasters. This seemed like a wonderful opportunity to indulge in some excitement, as it was raining and crowds were small. A few roller coasters, some lines, some walking, squiring a girl in face with water, and several hours later, we found ourselves in the middle of a downpour waiting for the empty Superman ride to startup again. Sadly, A.D.D. got the better of us, and we took off for home, making a short stop to see Snoop Dawg at a local gas station for some refreshments. This was probably the most interesting part of the day, and I must explain it in deep detail. After choosing three items to buy, two energy drinks, and one large bottle water, we took our soon to be beverages to the counter. Here we saw "Snoop Dawg" polishing a silver dollar, "you know, one of the ones before they came out with the Golden ones." He was quite the talkative fellow, explaining he had one for his kid's birthday, and one for his own now. He rung us up for the THREE drinks we had, and my total came up to be ten dollars, and thirty-six cents. This did not ring a bell, until we were well on our way home, as a clear rip-off, and thusly we decided "Snoop" had pulled a quick one on me, distracting me with stories of silver dollars, and soon to be marriages between him and his girlfriend. Though I do not feel dirty for loosing at least 4 dollars, since the experience was memorable. One and half hours later, after enduring horrible rain on the freeway home, as well as speeding truckers doing acrobatic moves on the road, I am here finishing my day telling you this exciting adventure that was, as I mentioned, a great cap-off to the last two days I have had. So.. as Chris mentioned already, I give you the advice of another good man, Thomas Carlyle; "What we become depends on what we read after all of the professors have finished with us. The greatest university of all is a collection of books." And this thing might soon become.. quite the book.

      Well in less than 10 hours I will be in Madison, minus wrestler, which is good, cause it means that I have time to sit down and get my bearings straight before having to deal with him as well.  Well I'm going to probably fall asleep about 4 so that means 4 hours of sleep, I think I might be spending a fair amount of my recent paycheck to keep me awake at work and the hours following, cause who wants to fall asleep their first night in Madison at 9!?  Looks like the site is getting some people looking at it, keep reading, trust me, all three of us will have very interesting stories to contribute as the semester goes on.  Well time to get some sleep before I have to deal with the emotional baggage that my mom is sure to bring tomorrow.

      Ken, where the heck is your roommate parking his car, it's got to be outrageous there for parking.  Because my wrestler is bringing the tv and couch my room's going to feel empty for a couple days, hopefully someone on my floor will have a tv and is moving in early.  Turns out Limita is moving in early so I'm not going to be the only one from west there early, which will be nice as well.  Well time to go spend my mom's money some more probably post more later.

      Hrmm Chris moves in tomorrow, Maciej the day after... then I gotta wait until Friday.  My 'wrastler' isn't moving in until Sunday so I have 2 days to myself.  He's bringing the fridge and his laptop, and of course, his car... because he knows all the hot places around Milwaukee and will definately need it.... you know, since public transportation and a U-pass will not suffice.  Gonna be rough with only one loft though, maybe i'll have to do some convincin'... we'll see how things work out.

      Well... here we are.  	I do "Early Drop Off" on Tuesday, and then move in on Wednesday. "Early Drop Off" is where I get to drop all my furniture off early, so that it is easier to do rather than having to deal with all the crowds on actual move-in. My wrestler is already there, doing ROTC stuff. Hopefully everything will go well, I am all ready to move in with my fridge, TV, and everything else. I think the fridge will be the center-point of my room. All the focus will be around the fridge, and particularly the items inside which will include water, 7-Up (my favorite), as well as lots of salsa for chips, and some fruit to snack on. I'm hoping my wrestler will bring a bunch of vid. games and/or movies. 	I think the worse part about moving away is going to be meeting new people. Not just people, but meeting the type of people you like to hang out with. I don't know we will see. Good luck everyone.
