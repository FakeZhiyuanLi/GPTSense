       Well, last weekend was actually...alright, compared to my summer so far. My best friend John came over on Friday after we saw I' Robot and Spiderman 2. I thought that I'Robot would've been great if it weren't for that damn slow motion matrix crap. I also wasn't to crazy about Will Smith either.   Anyway, after I'Robot, we went straight into Spiderman 2. Now, Spiderman 2 was a hell of a whole lot better than the first. I thought it was cool for Mary Jane to actually find out who Spiderman was, and it was awesome when that one guy, I forget his name, found that secret room with his fathers mischievous toys.   Anyway, Saturday I opened up and closed my dad's shop (Cinerius Computers) all by myself. John kept me company for a while, then decided to head off home... A few hours later, Justin and Jared came by, and hung out till I closed. After I closed, we headed off towards Lake Jackson and picked up Michael and James. Jared dressed as a pirate and Michael dressed as his oriental slave. We went to the mall and met up with Kendal and Chris (a.k.a. Snakpac) and just did stuff, I don't know, I forget...then we ate at Cici's Pizza.   Jared dropped everyone at thier house, including me...then I did some stuff..and when Sunday came..I had a Lord of the Rings marathon with no breaks..well bathroom of course....   ...and there was my fantastic weekend all in a nut shell.
