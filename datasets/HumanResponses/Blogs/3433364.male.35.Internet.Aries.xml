       I have to say this... I saw the video of Nick Berg getting his head cut off a couple of weeks ago - and frankly, I was disturbed - no, not for the obvious reason either..  Not how you'd be disturbed by  urlLink this  - more that there was something not quite right about it.  By that I mean  fake.   I brought up the topic with my friend:  Me: "Have you seen the Nick Berg clip yet?" Him: "Yeah - fake as, eh?"  I didn't venture an opinion, just the topic, and he thought it was fake too, without prompting.  No I've looked all over  urlLink t'internet  for others who think this, to no avail.  Come on, are you all keeping quiet out there?  Or, like me, is it just that because almost all of us have never actually  seen  a severed head with our own eyes, that severed heads actually  look  fake - because we (as humans) expect a head to be connected to a body?  Does that make sense?  Anyway - to elaborate...  We humans have fairly well evolved brains  - but they are easy to fool - you know, optical illusions, things like this: the cat sat on the the mat ..or something like that - I'm sure you've seen it.. Have you noticed though, in movies when you get severed heads - say like at the beginning of Gladiator - they look shite?  With all those special effects people doing their stuff, how come this is always the case?  Is it another example of us seeing something we are not used to seeing, and rejecting it?  I realise I'm trying to explain why the clip looked fake - to show that I've thought about the possibility of it being real.  But look at it another way - if you're a superpower fighting an unjust war, and you've been shown up to be someone that allows torture - maybe even sanctions it - from your own army in fact - how can you try to continue to justify it?  By showing up the 'enemy' as the barbarians that the are?  Or hiring a special effects team to show an apparent execution?  It wouldn't be the first time that an special effects team has been asked to  urlLink fake reality  would it?   Update   I just did another search on Google, and here are some links to some opinions on the clips authenticity:   urlLink Clicky Here   urlLink Here   urlLink Here   urlLink And Here

       Well, I've been meaning to do this for ages - a blog I mean - but I've been putting it off because I've not known how to begin and so on.  Bullshit eh?  No more excuses.  So here goes...
