      Jered Weaver, kid sibling of pot-smoking, walkoff home run-serving, major league crybaby Jeff, is expected to be among the top picks of the 2004 MLB draft.  He's put together one of the finest seasons ever by a college pitcher, going 14-0 in 16 starts with a 1.25 ERA and 182 Ks in 122 innings, with a WHIP of 0.55.   Ravizza meets with the players in a classroom setting during January practices before school gets back in session, laying out his approach, one centered around a phrase that's a baseball clich√©: One pitch at a time.    Ravizza gives the old saw meaning, however. It encompasses a player controlling himself, forcing himself to commit fully to each pitch and trusting his abilities. While some players laugh off "the mental game," Weaver takes it as seriously as he does throwing the perfect slider with a full count and the bases loaded. He has to. He might not succeed in that situation without it.     "It's about not wearing your heart on your sleeve," Weaver says. "You just worry about what you can control and think about the next pitch."  "It's like a 3-year-old playing with a fire truck," Ravizza says. "That 3-year-old is totally absorbed in playing with that fire truck and doesn't notice anything around him. For a pitcher, it's not worrying about the last pitch, or the umpire who makes mistakes because he's working a part-time job, or an error made in the field."   Looks like young Weaver's benefitted a bit from mental preparation and composure, something his brother severely lacks.   Yankees  Tanyon Sturtze cherry picks a win last night with this line: 1/3 IP, 2 H, 2 runs allowed (inherited). Great job dumbass, keep it up.   Misc.  As we head into the offical start of summer (Memorial Day) here's a good  urlLink article  on how to write a Jack Johnson song, and how that song will get you laid.

       urlLink BH Kim  flew home to his native  urlLink Korea  to have his 'back' looked at.  One can only hope he is back in the States soon enough to hand the Yankees another win.  Jeter's going to have to go on a  urlLink diet  soon, because he's in danger of not hitting his weight.    Interesting quotes by  urlLink Sheffield , translated to mean, "I suck because the pitchers suck."  Okay, buddy.  We're going to hold you to that when you face Schilling, Hudson, Prior, etc.  In non-professional news, Dusty Baker's kid is expected to miss at least  urlLink two little league games , and possibly a pool party, after straining his elbow against the Thompson's Exxon Royals in Napierville last weekend.  His pitch count?  142.

      Danny Graves has 21 saves on the season already, out of the Reds 26 wins.  Saving over 80% of a team's games is almost unprecedented.   urlLink Here's  an interesting look at high save numbers in recent years, showing how seriously devalued and worthless this stat is.

      Check these  urlLink stats  out. Using correlation analysis this guy with lots of free time was able to show the strength of the relationship between runs scored and various other statistical categories. Unfortunately he only did the American League, but still interesting.

      From Gammons, "Between conflicting diagnosis' and all the trade flap during the winter, it has been a rough seven months for Garciaparra. But he is standing up well, a testament to the strength of the support from his remarkable wife, Mia."  Do you get the feeling that Gammons is doing Mia on the side?

      All set to sit back and watch the Yankees this afternoon, only to find out that my $150 gets me no Saturday afternoon games due to the national game of the week blackout.  I'm going to blame this one on Selig too.

      The Yankees are heading to Texas for the first time this season; this is the first time A-Rod will appear in Arlington in pinstripes.  Given that they booed him every at-bat in Seattle last week, he should be prepared for even more this series.    Hopefully a couple of  urlLink 450 foot bombs  and some  urlLink Nettles-like glovework  shut them up.  My buddy  urlLink Bud Selig  said that MLB will announce where the Expos will play in 2005 by mid-July.  I'd take this with about the biggest grain of salt you can find.  Don't look now, but the  urlLink Evil Empire  is back in first place.  Did someone forget to tell the Nets that Game 7 was last night?  Kidd obviously missed the memo.

      ESPN has some good links to baseball news. If you've never checked them out, do so now:  urlLink ESPN Baseball   It's hard to put into words just how I feel about Bud Selig, but this article pretty much  urlLink nails it.    urlLink Jose Lima  sang the National Anthem as a Dodgers game last week, flanked by his kid, his wife, and her giant  urlLink boobies.   Hey Moises, no need to be embarassed.  I pee on my hands too- haven't dropped a TPS report in months.  I've heard of being drunk OFF your ass, but this is a  urlLink whole new ballgame.

      The Washington Post had a very illuminating  urlLink one ,  urlLink two ,  urlLink three  part series on the business side of baseball which has only fueled my hatred for that rat bastard Bud Selig.   Part 1  discusses the snowjob Selig and the Brewers did on the taxpayers of Wisconsin, ultimately getting Miller Park built with absolutely no capital expenditures from the team or its owners, and subsequently using the increased revenues to service old debt rather than build the team up.   Tucked into the legislation was an unusual side deal Thompson had proposed to Selig. The governor had arranged to have a quasi-public agency, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA), lend the Brewers $50 million. The team would use the money as part of its $90 million contribution to the stadium. The $90 million was key: Lawmakers wanted to know Selig, too, was chipping in.    The WHEDA loan was a political solution to a hard reality: The Brewers didn't have the money. The team came up with the remaining $40 million by selling the ballpark's name to the Miller Brewing Co., then using the 20-year, $41.5 million contract as collateral to obtain more debt. In other words, the Brewers' only financial contribution would come from selling the name of a ballpark for which Wisconsin taxpayers had paid.   As much as Selig is to blame for ramming this stadium deal through, I have to put some blame on the people of Milwaukee and their elected reps for not having the balls to demand full disclosure of the Brewer's financial status before allowing the park to be built.   Part 2  talks about Selig's near universal powers he holds over the game, and the subsequent dragging out of the Expos relocation process.  The power he holds allowed him to swap franchises among favored friends like they were nothing more than trading cards.    A quick synopsis:  Jeffrey Loria owned the Expos around the time contraction was brought up.  He knew his team stunk, but he wanted to stay in baseball.  So he feigned outrage at contraction, thereby upping his buyout price, which allowed him to sell the Expos to MLB at a grossly higher value than they were worth.  This enabled him to buy the Marlins from...  John Wayne Henry, who wanted out of Miami after he realized that buying a World Series team that had been stripped for parts isn't the brightest way to do business, especially with a fickle fan base that has a wealth of other entertainment options at their fingertips.  Selig stepped in and played matchmaker, lining Henry, Lucchino, and Tom Werner up to buy the Red Sox, at a price that some say was not the highest offer, but was pushed through due to their special relationship with the old car salesman himself.    Apparently there were other swaps discussed, all of which involved Selig's cronies.     Selig was asked where Washington fit in to baseball's baffling jigsaw puzzle. Would the nation's capital finally get a team?  Perhaps Selig's mood got the better of him. "I'd have to say that given the demographics of the area and all the people who want it, they are the prime candidate," he said.  Relocation, Selig said on Jan. 17, 2002, was coming "in the near future."    Part 3  sheds some light on how Selig manipulates people and franchises to the benefit of himself, his buddies, and the Milwaukee Brewers.   One Major League Baseball official who has worked closely with Selig described him as "an expert in behavioral modification."  "Some of his preferred tools are off-the-record character assassination made to the media and other owners, and minimizing [owners'] participation in high-profile committees," the official said. "Remember that the majority of the owners are egocentric and want to be respected and admired by their peers. Most have paid a significant price to become a member of this exclusive club and hate the thought of being publicly or privately shunned or minimized by other members."  Selig's most successful project has been Angelos. "If Peter was backstabbing Bud and screwing the industry, we'd have a team in D.C. right now," said the official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. In fact, Selig and Angelos are "almost linked at the hip," the official said.   To this day, neither Selig nor his top aides have officially discussed the Expos-in-DC proposal with Peter Angelos for fear of pissing him off.  We are currently two years into the Expos wandering in the desert, with an  urlLink apparent All Star Break deadline  to announce their plans, and they have not even started to talk about the bribe it would take to put the Expos near Angelos' franchise?    I have never seen a city more ready to embrace a professional baseball team.  I went to an Orioles game from my home/work in Arlington last week and spent a total of 4 hours in the car versus 3 hours of baseball.  The amount of wealth in DC and Northern Virginia is staggering, and the Expos, with the vestiges of a great farm system, combined with some actual monetary support, would quickly become one of the better franchises in baseball.    But we wouldn't want to piss off a filthy rich lawyer who has run his team into the ground, content to let Camden Yards be the attraction rather than the players on the field.  Slick Pete has practically been building a case against DC by shooting himself in the foot.   The more I read this stuff, the more pissed off I get.  Can't wait to watch the Portland Expos next year.  I'm out.

      A division by division look at the playoff races...   NL WEST    Fast Times at Petco Park   urlLink Jeff Spicoli  scored from second on a routine grounder that the D-Backs booted, and the Padres won last night to hang tight at 2.5 games back in the NL West.  The Pads have been a pleasant surprise this year, with a young team playing very well.  Former Little League hero Sean Burroughs has hit well, though he could be part of a package to obtain Carlos Beltran.  A rotation of Jake Peavy, Brian Lawrence, Adam Eaton, Ismael Valdes, and old man David Wells has looked solid in the tough NL West.  One down note however, is the Padres #1 pick in the draft a few weeks back, Matt Bush, has already been  urlLink suspended indefinitely  due to his involvement in a bar fight.  Maybe the little Weaver pothead would have been a better pick, at least he'd be a little more mellow...   Welcome to the OC, Bitch  The Dodgers are currently one game back of San Fran in the NL West, having fallen off the pace over the last 10 games.  Led by psycho  urlLink Milton Bradley  and a surprising Adrian Beltre, they have hit better than they did last year (as if they could do any worse.)  Billy Beane recently tried to swing a deal that would have brought the Dodgers Carlos Beltran and sent Guillermo Mota to Oakland, but  urlLink GM Paul DePodesta  obviously thought the better of trading with a guy whom he watched fleece the rest of baseball for the past 4 years, and the deal fell thru.  It might be a good thing in the end, because Mota, Darren Dreifort, and Gagne have combined to form one of the best bullpens in baseball, rarely relinquishing an inherited lead.   Flowers in Your Hair  The Giants have surged into first place on the strength of an 8-2 past ten games, riding the hot arm of unheralded star  urlLink Jason Schmidt .  Schmidt threw a 1-hitter at the Red Sox on Sunday, further strenghthening his case as the top starter in the NL this year.  Barry Bonds continues to hit, and his 7 to 1 BB/K ratio is absolutely stunning.   urlLink Rubber chickens  have become Giants fans' way of expressing their displeasure with those who continue to pitch around Balco Barry.   NL CENTRAL    The Kid Returns  The past few years, it seemed like  urlLink Ken Griffey Jr  had an extra first name, "Oft Injured", but the Kid of old is back again, launching bombs with his seemingly effortless swing.  He, along with Sean Casey and big Adam Dunn, have slugged the Reds into contention.  Save machine Danny Graves and solid Paul Wilson lead a bit of a patchwork pitching staff that will need a lot of help to hang in this tough division as the season progresses.  Help could come in the form of recently acquired  urlLink Porn Stache White , but that is doubtful.   Big Shoulders, Great Pitching  The Cubs have the 3rd best team ERA in baseball, despite losing Mark Prior and Kerry Wood for stretches of time.  Carlos Zambrano has turned into a bona-fide stud, at 8-2 with a 2.25 ERA and WHIP of 1.13.  Bodily functions have played a big role this year, as Sammy Sosa went on the DL after  urlLink sneezing , and we found that  urlLink Moises Alou likes to relieve himself...on himself .  Aramis Ramirez continues to blossom, leading the team in batting and RBI's, and still only just shy of his 26th birthday.   Cards in 1st, Nelly Still Sucks  St. Louis is doing their damnedest to hold off the surging Cubs, currently one game up, and with the 2nd best record in baseball.  Albert (24 years old, my ass) Pujols and Scotty Rolen are slugging their way through the league this year, both posting an  urlLink OPS of over .1000 .  The starting pitching hasn't been great so far, with most ERA's in the 4's, and with Prior getting back to speed and Maddux settling in, the Cards should be worrying about the Cubs soon enough.    NL LEAST     Meet the Mets  If any team with a  urlLink $100 million payroll  can be considered scrappy, it may be the 2004 Mets.  Or it could be just a .500 ballclub in a crappy division, but they are now sitting 2.5 games out of first.  Their hitting is terrible, but the best team ERA in baseball is allowing the Mets to hang around.  Elder statesmen Tom Glavine and Al Leiter lead the way, but it's probably only a matter of time before the Mets' appearance on the back pages is due less to their play than to their  urlLink antics .  Six games vs the Yankees over the next two weeks should help push them back down to familiar ground.   Ph the Phillies  The Phils are 18-16 both at home and on the road this year, leading one to believe that they are not fully acclimated to their  urlLink new park  enough to make it an advantage yet.  Jim Thome continues to mash, and has to be the second most feared slugger in the NL after Boston Bonds.  Rollins, Abreu, and  urlLink Burrell  are all having solid seasons once again, but Kevin Millwood, with a WHIP of almost 1.50 has been a disappointment.  They will most likely need to add a quality arm out of the pen, or get a better showing from the rotation to contend even in this weak division.   Thanks for Coming Out  The defending champion Marlins continue to show why baseball does not belong in Miami, drawing a sad  urlLink 23,000 per home game , 20th in the bigs.  Ace Josh Beckett has been on the DL and is scheduled to make his first start back this Saturday.  This could provide a much needed shot in the arm for a team that has gone 4-6 over their last ten.  Miguel Cabrera, at age 21, continues to show why he will be one of the better players in baseball for a long time, playing solid defense and posting an OPS of over .900.   urlLink Carl Pavano  may be one of the best unknown pitchers in baseball; look for him in the All-Star game this year and you may be pleasantly surprised.

      The  urlLink Yanks  have won 18 out of their last 21 games, bringing their record to 42-21, with a 5.5 game lead over Beantown.  Jeter and Bernie have been on fire over that time period, each raising their once horrible averages to around  urlLink .260.   I don't know about you, but I think  urlLink BH Kim  has All-Star written all over him.   urlLink Nomah is sad , poor thing.  I'm sure he'll be happier when he's playing  urlLink second base  for the Yanks next year.  Bud Selig update: I just checked, and he is still a lying scumbag.

      There once was a knight from Aruba, Whose body was shaped like a tuba, He talked trash to the Yanks, And twice he was spanked, Have another twinkie, you goober.  The fattest knight in Aruba, Sidney Ponson made some noise yesterday:   Baltimore Orioles starting pitcher Sidney Ponson stopped short of declaring a victory over the New York Yankees, the team with the best record in baseball after the Orioles 13-4 demolishing of the Boston Red Sox earlier tonight.   "I was laughing after my last start because I had them in the palm of my hand, leading 3-0 and I wasn't even pitching my best. I really (bleeped) up a chance to beat them. People misinterpreted what I did on the mound and after the mound. I think their pitching is average at best and if we had the money to compete with them, we'd be right there. We have only 6 less wins than them for all their money spent, so what does that say about them? I think I will stymie them today."   Yankees catcher Jorge Posada did not see the same thing as Ponson  "We beat him and his team last week. He has to be able to say what I just said about me and my team next week, otherwise he should shut up."   After last night's game, his line vs New York on the year looks like this: 0-2, 13.07 ERA, 2.57 WHIP, 4 HR allowed.    This guy is crazy.   Anyone hear about the latest board game from  urlLink Milton Bradley?  It's called "Pin the Five Game Suspension on the Crackhead."

      So my fears of the Yankees awful lineup today were realized, but  urlLink El Duque  and Lilly throw zeroes at each other for 7 innings, and the Yanks are saved by a 2-out walkoff homer by big Rube.   The old Cuban has now pitched 3 great games in a row, and is gaining strength with each start.    I like it.

      Bernie can't hit his weight.  Giambi's got worms.  Moose is injured and cranky.  There's no fifth starter.  Kevin Brown is old.  El Duque may be even older.  Jeter's got a broken hand.  Sheffield's shoulder is barking.  Enrique Wilson my be the worst player in the majors.  I don't trust Jon Lieber.  Ruben has been a nice surprise.  Flash, Q, and Mo have combined for 3,000 appearances already.  There are zero prospects in the minors.  The Yankees are 8 games up on the Sox and are playing .634 ball.  They have 18 games left (out of 70) vs the hapless Blue Jays.

       Hoops   So it looks like the Nets are about to trade  urlLink K-Mart  to Denver for a package of picks.  I understand the fact they they didn't think Martin's worth a max contract, but you've got a team going deep into the playoffs each year, and you don't get anything of present value for trading your 2nd or 3rd best player?  I got a bad feeling ownership is buckling down and not spending any money until the Brooklyn move is finalized.  Maybe they'll trade Kidd, and build around RJ and future picks once the big Kittles/Mutombo contracts are off the books?  Shaq is now headed to South Beach, and there's a distinct possibility that Kobe will be heading across town to the Clips this afternoon.  If this happens, it will be the biggest mass exodus of talent from a contender since Farley, Myers, and Sandler all left  urlLink Saturday Night Live in 1995.    Baseball   Big Unit possibly on the move, with possible destinations being NYY, BOS, CHI-A, CHI-N, ANA.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out.  If either the Yanks or Bosux pick him up, anything other than a World Series title will be a giant, giant disappointment.  No one knows who has the upper hand, but the  urlLink Big Unit's dislike of Mouth Schilling  could be a factor:     When asked about the unsuccessful phone calls Schilling made to Johnson's cell phone this week, the left-hander dryly said, "there's a reason why I changed my number."   Seems Mr. Johnson has better taste in clubhouse buddies than he does in haircuts...  In Minor League news, the International League beat the Pacific Coast League in the  urlLink AAA All-Star Game  last night on a 10th-inning walkoff home run by Columbus Clippers (Yankees) 3rd baseman Andy Phillips.  Phillips is batting .327, 14, 46 and his middle name is Tradebait.   Bobby Digital   Picked up  urlLink NCAA Football 2005  for the old Xbox this week, and the game is better than ever.  You now have to manage your players' discpline, and can bench starters or suspend them for infractions like skipping class or being too rowdy.  I have yet to find the option that allows the coach to party the night before a road game and hit on the opposing school's co-eds.  Maybe that's in the hoops version.     Also eagerly awaited is  urlLink ESPN's  football product, coming out in a few weeks.  Aside from the fact that TO is on the cover, the game  urlLink looks pretty sweet , and a bargain at only $20.  Being a Giants fan, this game may be my only chance to see my favorite team on the right side of the win column more than a few times this year.

      - David Ortiz working the count, playing Moneyball, taking about 28 straight pitches before swinging.  - The 5'9" jackass in a Cubs uniform snagging all the fly balls in the OF, surrounded by about 75 kids under 4'8".  - Pedro braiding Manny's hair on the third base line, while Mrs. Schilling painted his toenails.  - Miguel Tejada attempting to speak english after he won.  - Barry Bonds snatching the Century 21 winner's $250k check, claiming he's owed it for participating.  - The white shoes were money, but the sad thing is that that is the extent of Jeter and A-Rod really being rebellious.  - Man-Ram might be the dumbest nickname ever.  - I like how Piazza spends all of his time telling the press the feud with Roger doesn't matter; he still pissed at himself for wussing out 3 years ago.  - I hear the only reason Jimy Williams was on the field last night is because Bud put the kibosh on 'baseball business' during the All-Star break to prevent his firing.

      Lots of crazy people coming out of the woodwork today.   Fatass   urlLink John Kruk  has another brilliantly written column on  urlLink ESPN , expounding on the reasons why ex-ballplayers deserve more jobs in the game after retiring.  Gee John, you couldn't possibly be angling for a coaching job yourself, as your ESPN contract won't be renewed if there's anyone with half a brain in Bristol?   Drunkass   urlLink Derek bLowe  spouts in Boston last night about how people think his pitching problems are mental...for 20 minutes.  Sure did a lot to help your cause there buddy.   Punkass  MLB has resorted to  urlLink compensating Barry Bonds  for missing a day of rest to compete in the Home Run Derby this year.  He's also against the idea of batting leadoff, both in the All-Star Game and for the Giants, saying, "I didn't like to lead off when I was doing it in Pittsburgh. I don't get ready that fast. It's too early in the game."  Those ten minutes really make that big of a difference I guess...

      The Yankees have taken the first two of a three game set from the Red Sox  so far, setting up a gargantuan mismatch of  urlLink Brad Halsey  v  urlLink Pedro Martinez  tonight.    The first game was an  urlLink 11-3 laugher , aided by a dozen Sox errors, and a couple opportunistic bops by the Bombers.    Last night's contest was more of the same but probably more disheartening for the Beantowners, as Wakefield baffled the Yanks through 6 innings before a couple key errors  urlLink tipped the game to the home team .    All the Moneyball in the world hasn't helped Boston this season, and it seems like amost every good bat in the lineup is playing out of position on defense.  Unless OBP and OPS grab a glove and give the Sox a couple extra fielders, it could be a long summer in Red Sox Nation.
