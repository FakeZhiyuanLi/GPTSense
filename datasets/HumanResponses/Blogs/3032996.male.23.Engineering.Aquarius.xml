      So this is my first post to my first blog.  Still don't like the word blog.  So I'm just going to call it a list of ideas.  Maybe my ideas will proliferate and be infringed upon because theres no legal recourse on these things.

      Looks like our friends at  Pitchfork Media  liked our idea so much, they copied it.   At the end of 2003  we ran a "Best Cds [Pete] Bought in 2003" feature.  Pitchfork just released their own list... 4 months later.  Just goes to show PCM is where its at. urlLink Found Sound 2003: Pitchfork Feature

        My room is pretty sparse right now. Save for the bed, computer, and dirty clothes, the room is unadorned. ANd then it hit me, I need a mantle. I have a portrait of my ancestor Theobald Jelliffe, a Prussian Baron, that needs to go up, and it needs top billing. And what better way to draw attention than to hang it above a friggin' mantle? Along with the mantle come certain responsibilities, duties if you will. Such as wearing a smoking jacket, drinking exclusively brandy, and exclusively in snifters, and of course hosting Masterpiece Theater. Come Christmas time I'll have a place to hang my stockings. I'll also have a place to line up my antique cans. I can't wait to show off my 1903 Del Monte series.

      Well, not quite a year ago today New York had a tremendous blackout, throwing everything into disarray, and bringing people together one hot, dark, apartment at a time.  This year, my two roommates and I decided to commemorate the occasion with our own blackout, limited entirely to the confines of our apartment.  Granted this wasn't planned, desired, or even unobtrusive.  It seems we were the unwitting pawns in a diabolical scheme. No?  Well would you believe sabotage by a revenge-thirsty figure from our shady past?  Didn't think so.  How about, no one told us to sign up with Con Edison?  There we go.  File under: "Now I know better."   Take it from me, blackouts are not as fun if 8 million other people aren't experiencing the same thing.  And when you feel like a retard, it makes it even worse.  The good news is, we won't be held responsible for the $550 tab the previous tenant was kind enough to skip out on.  If you're out there, I'm thinking of you... and holding your head under water until you stop struggling.

      Well it's probably 17 years since the Gameboy first came out, revolutionizing the school bus ride, as well as giving parents a way to shut up the kids in the back seat.  And now the biggest step forward since the Gameboy got a color screen:  urlLink screens !  News about the Gameboy DS isn't anything, er... new, but they just released images of the final design.  And it looks just like the old LCD Donkey Kong game where you climbed up a ladder avoiding barrels.

        I've been working on the Choco the Hippo brand identity since last night, and I've realized something.  Hippo's are damn hard to anthropomorphize.  First of all the have no necks, and walk on four feet.  Second, the look like a cross between an elephant and a seal.  Third, I have to accentuate the fact that Choco is morbidly obese and happy about it.  So this little cartoon helps, but I'm still quite a ways form drawing a Choco that matches my mental representation. Here's a little background on Choco:  Choco is upset about the bad rap that carbs have been getting lately, and he's hedging his bets that there will be a carb throwback pretty soon.  So he's coming out with a new cereal that's "chock full o' carbs."  So chock full o' carbs that the cereal is incredibly dense and each 12 ounce box will weigh in at about 6 to 10 pounds.  The recipe is still being tweaked.  Atkins is so 2 years ago, jump on the The band wagon on the ground level, while you can.

      So my new phone has  urlLink Bluetooth , a wireless technology that is being used in anything from a phoen to a washing machine. Problem is, I dont have antyhing else that supports Bluetooth yet. Neither my computer nor my dishwasher can send messages to my phone yet. That's where this  urlLink thing  comes in. It's both a Bluetooth hub, and a flash memory stick, so I can transport illegally downloaded music as well. Pretty handy.  Here's what gets me, though. Whoever came up with the word dongle though should be shot. How the hell is a fledgling technology supposed to take off, if talkign abuot it produces fits of grade school giggling? HDTV had it bad enough, and it doesn't even conjure up images of the male anatomy.   "Hey what's that you're carrying around?"  "This? Oh, that's just my dongle."  "Ha ha, you're playing with your dongle!" &ltPUNCH&gt "Don't do that in public. You sicken me." Brilliant.

         This weekend I counted my change, which I store in a Carlo Rossi 4L  wine jug. It's only half full but so far contains a whopping $290  USD. It's literally a nice chunk of change.  A 30 pound chunk.  I felt like Ebeneezer Scrooge, stacking coins to my heart's content, as the living room floor became more and more cluttered with currency.  It started to look like a formation of Roman centurions, marching across the Rubicon.  My army of coins is going to march over to Commerce Bank instead, and get converted into a more compact and efficient paper bill covert action team.  One that can slip in and out of my wallet virtually undetected.  Or perhaps I'll convert them into pure energy, and store them in the ethereal realm that is online banking.  Stay tuned...

            Litter  gets on the tracks and catches  fire    and that causes train  delays  that make you  late  aside from making trains and stations  untidy  because a little litter goes a long way   This is an exact replica of an&nbsp;incredibly poorly worded PSA from the MTA. This sentence runs on forever, throwing punctuation to the side, as well as any semblance of grammar. Did they have a contest in elementary schools to see which first grader could write the best anti-litter poster? I especially like the use of red lettering so that punctuation actually becomes unnecessary. You naturally stop and pronounce the words "litter" and "fire" in a menacing voice, much more dramatically than any comma or semi colon could ever make you do.
