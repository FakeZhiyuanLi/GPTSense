      Now, I have realized. I can never love you any less than I do right now.   You mean the world and a half to me.   I hope we can grow together...through good days, bad days, hard days, easy days, happiness, tears, smiles and frowns. I want to experience all I can with you.   I hope we can grow to understand each other, share our joys and understand our weaknesses and faults.   I have come to love you more now then I ever have before.  &nbsp;  ...And you better go to my Junior Prom with me!...

      It's only one o'clock in the afternoon and I'm already having a no-good-very-bad-day. It sucks. I feel angry, upset, taken advantage of, ignored, not trusted, questioned, cornered, alone, betrayed and most of all, unloved...and only by you.   This is the one time in my life that I have ever thought about regretting you.   I hate this feeling. Don't make me feel this way.   I can guarantee that in the next 4 hours, I will feel SO much better about everything. But until then, I feel like shit. I hate complaining. Honestly, things for me aren't so bad. Nothing has been way too hard, or something that I can't get over. I always cry like a little girl because something  changes . It's about time I got used to change because it can't be stopped. As much as I don't want things to change, they're gonna.   You were the one person who promised you would never change. Don't start now.

      Ok, so I've been really bad about updating this baby. Haha. You all knew that didn't you?  &nbsp; Well, everything has been somewhat normal around here. I have summer school from 3-7pm. STILL. Eh, it'll be over on the 27th, so I'm not&nbsp;too worried about it. &nbsp; Kyle and I hang out all the time. Literally. But it's so great. We aren't getting sick of each other so that's an   AWESOME    sign. :)    &nbsp;  We are trying to go to Six Flags on July 29th and we are trying to get some people to go. It might just be him and I, but that's all cool too!     &nbsp;  I'm kinda bummed, because my mom has decided to send me to Las Vegas from the 31st to the 6th. That bums me out because it's so boring out there and there's nothing to do. It drives me crazy.     &nbsp;  Kyle wants me to go to Nor. Cal. with him to visit his brother up there for a week. I wish I could go. Well, no one has said no becuase I haven't asked yet... :) I'll get to it...LOL.    &nbsp;  Yea, so that's about it. Haha. When something extravagant happens, I'll let ya know.    &nbsp;  Think about this: Which person has less of a life? The person  writing  about how they have no life, or the person whos too lazy to write about it, so they  read  about someone else's?

      All that needs to be said is:  &nbsp;     KYLE, I LOVE YOU         You make me so happy, and&nbsp;I feel so loved and wanted by you.&nbsp;I can never really explain how much you really mean to me. I never want to let you go.  &nbsp;  You're my little grilled cheese buddy! *smoochie smoochie*  &nbsp;  Song of the Moment- November Rain, by Guns n Roses.

      Well, today was summer school, AGAIN. My teacher got fed up with me, so he moved me to another part in the room. It's not really my fault. It's just so easy that I get bored fast and it causes me to talk. I don't mean to. But it's ok, I have way over an A, so I'm not too worried about it.  Yea, not much more than that happened today.  I didn't get to go to Poolside but I will definitely go next week.  Tomorrow morning, Kyle is gonna hang out with me before school. Yay.  Alrighty...I'll talk more lata.

      Man oh man.  Today was awesome.  I woke up late and messed around all morning, eating cereal and being lazy. Then, around 1, I jumped in the shower and got ready for school. I put on my cherry skirt, black and white tank tops, black flip-flops, and I was ready to roll. All through summer-school, I was anticipating my departure. I couldn't wait. I've been waiting for this concert for 3 weeks now.  So anywho, at exactly 7, Kylie came and picked me up and we rushed back to his house to pick up A-rock and run like hell to the concert. Turns out, we got there early, got to our seats just in time to see Lit openening up the show. They are pretty good live, but I only knew a few songs. The bassist was a fricken crack addict. He was spitting on people and such...it was awesome.  Yea, so anyway, then it was "intermission" so we got up and got some lemonade. As we were walking to the stand thing, this totally wasted guy bumped into me and I'm like "Oh, sorry." And he's like "Sorry...blah ba deet dot bloo bab la dee blah" And I was like "What the..?" It was so fricken funny. LOL.  So, the lights went dark and Hoobastank made their entrance. It was AWESOME. They played a few songs I actually knew all the words to. They are REALLY good live. They sounds just like they do in the studio. They're awesome. So, a few songs go by and the chick sitting behind me has cracked her voice so much, I'm surprised she can still talk. Then, the lead singer is like "I don't how many of you have lighters on you, but all of you have a fuckin' cell phone, so take those damn things out and hold em up!" And then, they played THE REASON. I think it was the best I've ever heard it. Sitting there, hugging Kyle...it was like heaven. I was singing and screaming at the top of my lungs...I love that song. Then, Kyle asked me to be his girlfriend. Of course, I've been expecting it for the longest time, but it couldn't have been more perfect. All I could do was kiss the guy. I love him so much.  So, they played a few more songs, then the lead singer goes "This is my ode to girls" and he sang GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN in falsetto. OMG, it was the best thing in the whole world. I was cracking up and singing along...man oh man. Then, it went real quiet and me and A-rock screamed at the top of our lungs "BOB SQUAD!!" and everybody heard it I swear. So, then they sang Crawling in the Dark and the concert was over. It was kick ass. So, then we walk into the fair like losers, pay $13 to go one one ride and go outside to get picked up.  Where we were waiting, there was a street light type thing and right when Kyle and I stood under it, it went out. How weird? I mean, it's happened whenever we think about each other, but when we are both standing right there, and it just goes out outta nowhere. It's like it's meant to be.  We were waiting and these two drunk girls start screaming at each other from down the street, making total fools of themselves saying "You're ugly!" "You're beat!" "You're fat!". Oh God, it was hilarious.  Then Kyle's dad picked us up, took us back to Kylie's house and we made grilled cheese and Kylie took us home.  I think it was one of the best nights I've had in a long time. Well, I think I've written enough...agreed? LOL.  Kyle, I Love You.  Song of the Moment- The Reason, by Hoobastank (Seemed appropriate...)  Peace out boy scout!
