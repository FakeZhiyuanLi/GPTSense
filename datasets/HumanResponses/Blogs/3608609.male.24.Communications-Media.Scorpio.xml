      Time: 5.5 hours to go Location: fortress of solitude (back of Rolf’s store)  Dane and Joel finally removed their superhero costumes for a quick wash. The duo can’t wait until 7 p.m. when Spiderman 2 opens.   Dane wraps his lips around a straw and sucks up a huge amount of watermelon slurpee. A momentary brainfreeze cripples the crimefighter who can push big rocks with the greatest of ease. The second gulp does the same. Dane can’t take the pain anymore and slams the slush against the wall.  Joel comes back after attending to a customer, lights a cigarette and exhales a breath of pure smoke. A satisfying look crosses his face. With all the criminal inactivity in the Rocky area, Joel’s sobered up. He’s been too busy slaving for the man, Rolf, to devour gallons and gallons of rye serum. Dane wonders if this superhero team will disband in the near future.  “Only five and a half fucking hours to go,” states Joel, who has taken up swearing instead of drinking. “Shit! Spiderman 2 is going to fucking rock ass!”  “Yep,” Dane replies. “They should really make a new Superman movie.”   Joel begins a rant about some site with all the latest Superman movie gossip. Dane stares at the slurpee slowly dripping down the wall. How could a cup of delicious fluid defeat the mighty Dung Beetle Guy? It must be some ingenious weapon from some super villain, or maybe frozen drinks are DBG’s kryptonite.  “You know, fuck, Spiderman could kick the living shit out of fucking Superman, don’t you assface?” Joel inquires of Dane.   Dane gives Joel the glance of death. It doesn’t work. Dane wonders if his super powers are fading.   “How the hell could you say that!?” Dane yells back. “There is no possible way. Spiderman wouldn’t stand a chance.”  “Fuck you! All he’d need is some kryptonite crap,” Joel says. “Asshole Superman would be a useless piece of shit.”  “Damn it, you’re right,” concedes Dane. “But without kryptonite, Superman would smash Spiderman. Hell, even Superdog could squish Spiderman.”  “Well, that’s a given,” is Joel’s only reply.   The front door chimes. Joel rushes to the till ready to serve his next customer. He’s taking care of his duty to society. He sells legal drugs to addicts. Whether it’s sugar to kids, nicotine to smokers or porn to sexaholics, Joel is right there ready to feed the needs of the citizens of Rocky. Without Joel, they'd have to buy their stuff from someone else.

      Sung to the tune of Victory Day by Tom Cochrane:  He's got no reason, but he's got pride People thought Martin was through Sponsorship trouble? No, he cried We'll turn to see what is true Martin's Canada came into play On this Election Day  He's stuck it out, He's hung in tough Today just wasn't his day Attack ads came, but each time they did He managed to keep them at bay But plurality, it's escaped him today Harper grumbles, then goes on to say Pollsters need a big cut in their pay On this Election Day  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display This country's Red shone through anyway On this Election Day  Oh Layton, think of the children, said Layton But a two percent margin, that's kind of small It's all he could hope for, winning his seat That smiling ass didn't help his party at all And the Bloc-heads came through as usual Seperation coming? Well, they just can't say Four percent vote, just for the Greens They'll receive funding and I guess that's okay On this Election Day  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display Third and fourth parties got down and prayed On this Election Day  So this is the news as it happens A Liberal minority will now take the stage But don't get too comfy, because it seems That with no alliance you won't get to stay Just a matter of time Till the House says "We hate you and we want you to pay"  Election Day, Election Day There's no rockets flaring, there's no loud display See you in six months, or at least by next May The next Election Day, the next Election Day

      After casting your ballot and before heading out to get totally sloshed while awaiting the results, you might want to check out some [booming voice] urlLink Federal Election Trivia !  On another note, I was shocked to see a picture of George W. Bush mixed among pictures of the Canadian party leaders on the front page of the National Post. However, closer inspection revealed that it was actually Paul Martin squinting rather fiercely. This must mean something.  Sick to death of local radio stations and having an acute case of election fever, I've decided to connect to the live feed of CBC over the net. If we had decent reception in the area, I wouldn't have to do tie up the store's phone line doing this. And there's another small problem: election coverage doesn't start until six, and I'm not not planning on disconnecting until well after we close at eleven. But since I don't feel like fielding questions from fat assholes asking if there's tax on our candy, this is no big loss for me.  Dane has posted in the interim but because there was no editor around to correct his mistakes it posted on June 23. Go figure.

      Dane should've written something by now, but when he viewed our hit count yesterday he freaked out and is currently huddled under a coffee table and whimpering. I somehow knew it was a bad idea to get Extreme Tracking, but I never foresaw something like this. I guess I better throw something up here while the poor bastard recovers. I've got to quell the demands of our loyal readers (HAH!) before they start rioting in the streets...  But thanks to a bout of creative constipation - an all-too-apt metaphor considering the quality of my work - I'm currently undetermined about which comedic clich&eacute; I should abuse next. So in the meantime I'm going to toss up an old Outland cartoon. Trust me, it's a classic.    urlLink        If you're an ignorant jackass or an avid fan of Nickelback (although those two things aren't mutually exclusive) you need to click on the picture to view the strip at full size.  Also, if you don't know about Outland and its far better predecessor Bloom County, and are interesting in learning more, may I suggest clicking  urlLink here ? And if you're not, may I suggest that you get the hell off of this site? Thank you, folks; and have yourself a wonderful night!

      Okay, it's been almost a week, and neither Dane and I have made an effort to thank a very special person who's done our fledgling website right. Who am I talking about? Why, it's none other than  urlLink Steve Smith , who I'm sure needs no introduction. At least, if you're reaching this humble page through the means I'm sure you are. Thanks to his link to our site, our hit count has shot through the roof! So, as an effort to thank him, both of us have tried to unearth a photo so that we may glorify him to the masses. From what we've read this should've been a lot easier task than it turned out to be. However, after a strenuous effort involving equal parts luck, grit, and moxie we've managed to do it; and even better, it's one of him participating in council. So without further ado, we here at Super Fun Happy Amazing Hour present Mr. Steve Smith:         That's it, Steve! You go legislate evil a new asshole!

      Dane went to see Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story without me. The following cartoon encapsulates my feelings about this perfectly.              Beware Dane, beware.     Also, I'm very annoyed that this page has a much higher hit count than  urlLink my personal blog ; mostly because I put a lot more effort into making the posts there than I do here. So I should let you know that if you're looking for marginally more intelligent discourse than stories about drunken superheroes, you should go  urlLink check it out .

      In the past month, I've had the pleasure to attend four graduations. I only participated in my convocation from MRC. I've had to endure inspirational speech after inspirational speech. You can do whatever you put your mind to. The sky's the limit. You're about to embrace life. It's all the same.  I thought my graduation was special. I thought I was part of the only class that could become rich, famous and successful. I can't believe it's not true.   What did I want to do when I left high school? Damned if I knew, so I went to the University of Calgary for a semester. I studied psychology and economics. After I turned 18, I found the lib. I had to wait until the end of October to legally drink. I pretty much flunked out of UofC.   I took some time off before returning to MRC. I enrolled in some general study classes, keeping some of my schedule free for the liberty lounge. I ended up in the Journalism program. Fun times. Lots of drinking and laughs.  Four years later, I'm done. I just have two months of working at the Mountaineer before I'm mailed my degree. Yippy.  I don't remember any grad speech preparing me for that.  What's the point of graduating? I guess it's for the parents and the sentimental students.   Maybe I'm just sick of graduations. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my speal.

      It’s been three weeks since their last encounter with evil and they were starting to get bored. Dane, with his chips, and Joel, with the remote, were about to embark on another day of nothingness.  Dane thrusts his hand high into the air and brings it down with a loud crunch into the chip bowl. He grabs a handful and shoves them into his mouth. Smoky bacon chips are his favorite. Crumbs fall onto his chest. He doesn’t care.   “Why the hell don’t we ever get an email of distress from mayor Lou Soppit?” Joel demands.   Dane shrugs his shoulders. “Maybe email isn’t the best method,” Dane comments. “Batman and Commissioner Gordon used a phone. Maybe we should use a phone.”  “Shut up! You fool.” Joel yells and readies his hand for a bitch slap, but doesn’t execute. Dane is momentarily startled. “I’m the brains. You stupid ass. You do what I say.” Joel clenches his fist and raises it into the air. His elbow is at a ninety degree angle. A bright light shines in through the window, silhouetting Joel. A truly perfect superhero moment. Too bad Dane was the only one to see it, and he just doesn’t care.  Dane crams more delicious Lay potato chips into his mouth. Joel’s face returns to a normal skin tone after his burst of rage. Joel changes the channel. It’s muchmusic.   “Why the hell did they take Bob and Dave off TV?” Joel’s face regains its fiery red colour. The discontinuation of Bob and Dave is a sensitive subject for Joel.   “Calm down Joel. It’s just a show,” Dane says, regretting it moments later.  “JUST A SHOW. Mr. Show was more than JUST-A-SHOW.” Joel’s rage can’t be controlled. He stands up, spins three times and erupts. “Whoooop, whooop, whoop, whoop, whoop.” He does a perfect imitation of Dr. Zoidberg.   Dane bolts to his feet. He doesn’t have a clue what Joel is capable of. The last time Joel got this upset, Orlin found himself on the floor after a failed homework snatching. Dane’s hands raise to shoulder height and he begins pushing the air in front of him. It’s a defensive posture. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. The pair circle one another. It looks like a fight to the death is about to commence. The milkshake song plays in the background.   Bing! The computer chimes. “You have mail,” a robotic voice informs the crime fighting heroes. They rush to the laptop with delight. Their death match put on hold.  Joel clicks a couple buttons. Dane looks over Joel’s shoulder in anticipation. He wonders what kind of crime it could be. Godzilla? An alien invasion? Hell, he’d settle for a common nazi ninja fight.  “Spam. Fucking spam,” Joel looks to roof and screams. “AARRRRRGGGH.” Dane grabs his chips, sits back down and stuffs his face.

      Anthony is a busy guy on Mondays. You can tell by the way he wanders around the office with a disgruntled look on his face. Anthony is another reporter at the Rocky Mountain House Mountaineer, and Monday is production day, so it's busy.   I often wonder if all his wandering is really him planning out the quickest possible way to kill everyone. He counts his steps, and looks for problem areas. Where would the resistance come from? Where is the best and most likely place to reload? Is a nice circle route the best or would a quick in and out straight line be appropriate? Could he make it out the back door before the cops get to the paper? I'm sure he's clocked out how long it takes to drive from the police station the Mountaineer.   Then it happens. Snap! Anthony pulls his gun out of his camera bag. We all thought it was a Nikon D-100. It turned out to be an AK-47. Bullets spray the office. Two secretaries are left for dead. Little bloody holes appear on their bodies. The remaining employees panic. They yell and scream. The loudest cry comes from the desk in the corner, by the window. Dane didn't believe today could be the last of his life.  The only problem Anthony didn't foresee was Joel Nielsen: Disorientedman. He stumbles into the office with the first cries for help. Anthony, with his gun, tries and shoot the superhero. Unfortunately, the DoM's movements are unpredictable. One minute he's lurching to the right and the next moment he's face first on the ground. There's no way to anticipate the DoM's actions.  "Ssstoppp," slurs the DoM, spittle flies from his mouth as he unknowingly exaggerates his P in stop.  Anthony lets out a laugh. He has no idea the ass kicking he's going to get.  "dOOn't U laffff at meeee," the DoM utters as he crashes into the photocopier. A gush of blood erupts from his forehead. "Eowwww." Blood stings the DoM's eyes. His vision blurs, which doesn't help the double vision he already has.  "You stupid drunk bastard. Get out of here before you kill yourself," Anthony states. He points his gun at the DoM and makes a threatening face. It's really scary.  "I'mm not druunkk. I'm just disoriented, man," responds Joel Nielsen with DoM written on his chest. The reek of rye is on his breath and urine stains his pants. It's been a rough day of disorienting people at the local strip club. The DoM is starting to realize his tolerance to his rye transformation solution is increasing. He'll have to increase his dosage to doubles. It won't belong before he's downing triples.  Bang! Anthony fires his gun. Disorientedman can't stand up straight and falls over to his left, narrowly eluding the bullet.   "Hold still you piece of shit," yells Anthony, frustrated with the DoM's inability to stay still.  In the corner of the office, hidden under his desk another superhero is about to make an appearance.  Bang! A second shot. A second miss. Anthony lets loose a ferocious scream of frustration. The DoM falls to the ground and covers his ears.   "Whaaatt de helll waas thhat?" asks Joel's alter ego, as we grabs his flask of serum and downs a little. He gets to his feet after two failed attempts.  In the corner, a mask is pulled over a face.  Anthony lets loose a couple rounds. A bunch more employees are bloodied up. The DoM reacts. He falls forward straight onto Anthony's shoes. Just enough to hold Anothony in one spot. A death cry errupts from the corner of the room.   "Oh my god, it's the guy with the abilities of a dung beetle," Stu proclaims. It was earlier in the week Stu won a celebrity look alike contest for his Brent Butt impersonation.  "Yes it is I. Dungbeetleguy." DBG runs over to Anthony and pushes him against the wall. He rolls Anthony into a ball. The sounds of bones snapping can be heard by the radio station upstairs. DBG finally quits rolling Anthony into a bloodied pulp. He wakes the DoM up. The DoM passed out as soon as his head his the carpet.  Evil was vanquished and a new superhero duo formed. A pair that could rival Clark Kent and Superman, weed and Rob, Dave and Bob, peanut butter and jam on bread. Villains beware! Rocky Mountain House has a pair of crime fighters who aren't smart enough to get out of your way. With the DoM as the peanut butter and DBG as the jam, they're going to make one tasty sandwich.

      Joel advised me about Prey for Rock and Roll. He said Gina Gershon supposedly sucked. She did. The movie did and I'm pissed off I sat through the entire thing.   If a movie has a hot girl with a tight leather outfit on the cover, it should have some nudity. The movie needed something. At least Showgirls knew enough to put naked girls in the film. The back cover of Prey for Rock and Roll even mentions a sexy thrill ride. There was no sex, no thrill and I've had better rides on donkeys.  I did however watch dumb and dumberer. It was funny. Not as good as the first but decent. I would recommend it to friends, but only watch it once. After that, it becomes stupid. The jokes aren't funny after the one time. The actors are very similar to Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels, but they're not the same. Watch it though. It's stupid, but puts a smile on your face.  Now I'm back to thinking up schemes to keep the ladies away from Joel.

      Since Dane has deigned it beneath his station to post to the blog for the time being, I guess it's up to me to keep the home fires burning. So, howzabout a joke?  What's my favorite kind of bee?  Boo bee.  With luck on our side, Dane will be posting again soon. Then I'll never have to subject you to this again.

      This  urlLink story  was considered important enough to make the front page of yesterday's Edmonton Sun, but for the benefit of our readers who are either shut-ins or from Texas, I've decided to mention it here. It's yet another reason to give out a guttural snort of derision whenever somebody talks wistfully about married life.

      Once again Joel is using his superior intelligence to get back at me, check my bio. Damn your huge cranium. I shake my fist in your general direction. Why can’t you leave my obsession with Clay Aiken alone. He should have won. You know it; I know it. What’s wrong with the American people who voted? Don’t they know talent when they see it? Man, I’m starting to tear up. Time for a short break to regain my composure.  I’m back. What do I have to say? It’s a good thing George Michaels, Joel's hero, didn’t attempt to become an American Idol. He could never do it. Only the best of the best make it, like Van Dam in that movie with the fighting. What was it called?. So yeah. Take that. In your face Joel. Boo-yaaa. Rocky West Side. Out.

      Well, my blog partner has decided to start making posts. And just about all of them has something derogatory about me. It's almost to the point where Dane seems to have some psycho-sexual obsession with yours truly. However, I've decided to take the high road and not dignify this donkey braying with a response.  In other news, Dane has posted his  urlLink bio .

      I run out my front door, down the stairs and along the gravel road. Abruptly the road becomes a trail and the trail leads to a rocky, dusty clearing. The sky is blood red with black clouds. Lightning flashes in the background. Thunder rumbles. What world am I in?  Sweat drips down my forehead. My lungs burn. I’m exhausted. I can’t stop to catch my breath. I don’t know what I’m fleeing from. All I know is that it’s evil. I look back. There’s nothing. Why am I running? Fear.  Finally my legs give way. I fall to the ground. I crawl forward a couple metres. My hands clasp red dirt as I pull myself forward.   Out of the corner of my eye, a blurry specter appears. My mind panics. Who is it? What does it want with me? The ghost takes shape. It wears a black hooded robe, carries a scythe, has skeleton hands and two beady red eyes. Death has come to claim my life.  I roll on my back and stare. I try to scream but my throat is dry.   “Do you know who I am?” Death’s voice booms.   I nod my head. I’ve met him before. My skin crawls.   “I’m here to guide you to the land of the dead.” The wraith lifts its blade high in the air. It has to kill my body before my soul can leave the world of the living behind.  I don’t want to leave my life, my family, my friends. I grab a handful of rocks. I throw them.  Death chuckles at my pitiful attempt. My last glimpse is the scythe’s shiny, silver tip penetrating my chest. Blood splatters everywhere. I shut my eyes.  When my eyelids open, I’m standing next to Death, naked. I don’t feel any pain. My chest bears no scars. I’m no longer afraid. I’m curious. What’s happening now?  “Follow me,” orders Death. It’s not a scary voice anymore. It’s almost soothing. A James Earl Jones type voice. The earth feels like a sandy beach on my bare feet.   “Where to?” I ask.   “You’ll find out shortly,” is its reply. I follow.   We head towards a black portal. Just before I step into the darkness, I awake in my bed. Blankets drenched in sweat. I feel good though. I take five deep breaths, roll over and fall back asleep.   Dying equals death.  I’ve heard it’s supposed to be a bad omen to die in your dreams, well your nightmares. I’ve been told that you die in real life shortly after. It’s not true. I’ve been killed numerous times in my dreams and one time I even went out looking to kill Death. I didn’t succeed, but damn was I close. Death beheaded me on an altar that time.  I’ve been hit by cars. I’ve been shot. I’ve plummeted to my death. I don’t just wake up at time of impact. I actually leave my body, rise up and look down upon myself. The first time was creepy. The second time wasn’t any better, but now I’m used to it.   I don’t know what happens in the afterlife, but I’m getting very curious. It's a new mystery to explore. It's something totally new and exciting. No one can warn you. No one can prepare you for what to expect. Religions try, but there are so many of them. Who is right? Are we reincarnated? Do we become that new baby born in the maternity ward and begin on another life? Heaven? Hell? Do we sail across the sea for eternal life like the elves in Lord of the Rings? Maybe our bodies are unplugged from the Matrix? We’re tossed into the used battery drawer.   Whatever it is I hope it’s fun. I hope it’s like Mardi Gras, spring break, the 4th of July all wrapped up as a Christmas present.   I'm sure Joel will tell me it's dark, gloomy and not fun. Screw you Joel.

      Being a journalist, I get to cover some fun and exciting stuff. One example is town council. Seven councilors battle it out on a bi-weekly basis to keep the town thriving. They discuss the important issues and tackle the most minuscule details. I wouldn’t take their job for anything in the world, not even to put Mr. Show back on television. Sorry Joel.   At the latest meeting, one hot debate sticks out in my mind. It was the wording of a bylaw. The bylaw dealt with skating on frozen ponds and rivers and the posting of thin ice signs. The controversy was between “not uniformly consistent” versus “uniformly inconsistent.” The conversation went back and forth between two councilors. The public gathering, three people, found the whole ordeal amusing. The council took the matter very seriously. Now whenever the ice is not uniformly consistent, thin ice signs must be posted 75 metres apart. God bless the councilors and all their hard work.  Another subject on the agenda was the smoking bylaw. Should the town regulate where, when and who can smoke? Should the town stay out of the situation? The local bottle depot lady came with a report. Surprisingly enough places that make business off smokers didn’t want the town to do anything. Places that didn’t care, just didn’t care. And the minority of people who don’t want to die from a slow, painful cancerous death were opposed. I’m a non-smoker and don’t really care. My lungs enjoy clean, fresh air, but they don’t cry every time some second hand smoke comes their way. I’m still sitting on the fence on this subject. Should I leave because I don’t smoke and want some fresh air or should smokers leave because they have a nicotine addiction? In a perfect world, we’d invent a cigarette that didn’t give off second hand smoke. Everyone would be happy then. Or why don’t cigarette companies cure cancer. They have the money, and then more people would smoke, if they didn’t have to worry about dying from cancer.   Should the town of Rocky pay for the maintenance of our beloved windmill, or tear it down and replace it with a plaque on a rock? The windmill remembers all the Dutch/Canadian war heroes during world war 1, but that doesn’t really matter. Who cares about WWI? I do. I can’t believe the town would even think about demolishing something so important. We should just start kicking over tombstones and pissing on the graves. So it costs a little money. It’s a small price to pay. I’m glad I’m not in the bottom of some bloody, muddy trench awaiting my death. They’ll throw money at a $10,000 dollar clock, but remembering our war heroes is too much to ask.  The next greatest event in a small town journalist’s week is police briefs. The amount of small stupid crimes is outstanding. People report everything. “RCMP were informed about a student who left for school and failed to show up. The youth was located in Rocky a short time later.” Who cares? Amazingly it’s crime that sparks the readers interest the most.   “A complaint was made under the Mental Health Act about an unstable person who had left the Rocky hospital.” I believe this person was none other than Joel. His not wearing any pants antic finally made its way into the news. There’s even a pantless picture of Joel on this blog. After seven long years, Joel finally achieved his goal of being known as the pantless guy. Check that off the to-do list. He tried the backwards, inside-out shirt routine for a while, butt that didn’t last too long. Actually it was for only one day. A thumbs up for trying though. Not too many people would dare attempt the feat, but Joel wasn’t afraid of what his classmates thought.

      I'm not much of a political animal, so I can't rightly claim that I found this piece of  urlLink utter brilliance  by myself. Kudos goes to some  urlLink Steve Smith guy , who makes the only blog I read on a regular basis. Apparently he's a hack, which I'm guessing means he's in desperate need of some Buckley's, or he's a washed-up cab driver. Or maybe some other concept I'm entirely ignorant of. Anyway, check it out; you won't regret it. Or don't, it's entirely up to you...

      I was driving to work today, and like every convenience store clerk does in their free moments, I was pondering the mysteries of the universe. After kneading the old what is reality question in my brain for a while, I decide to turn to what is wrong with our world. Then, in a flash of brilliance, it hit me.  Flash back to 1987. What was a female sex symbol like back then? Well, for example:         Ah, good old Heather Locklear. Still attractive by today's standards. Now let's take a look at a male sex symbol:         George Michael. Ummm, yeah. Anyway, let's flash forward four years, to 1991. Female sex symbol, step right up:         Hmmm, Sharon Stone! The woman who made icepicks sexy! I know you don't want to, but let's look at a male sex symbol:         Vanilla Ice. Dammit. Puts everything into perspective, doesn't it?

      I have decided to increase my standards when it comes to leaving servers gratuities. I hate the way society deems it mandatory to leave a tip for every bit of service. I go to lunch; I have to leave a tip. I order a drink from the bar; I have to leave a tip. Enough is enough.  	 I could just be a pissed off cook bitching about the amount of money waitresses make. I could be whining and complaining because they’d treat the kitchen like shit. I might be pissed off because they didn’t see past all the drunks hitting on them that they weren’t the only ones with crappy jobs. I’d have traded jobs quicker than I can cut mushrooms, which is really fast I just don’t think the average server should get free money. I’m speaking about the bar industry waitresses. Not the ones in restaurants. They’re okay. 	 It really yanks my crank when a bartender needs a tip. Grab a beer, twist off the top and serve. Why should I tip for that? I do the exact same thing all the time. I don’t go to the fridge, stare at it and wish I had someone to open the door remove the cap and hand the beer to me. I don’t mind leaving a little change if the beer is brought directly to my table, but how much is it worth? And what is their hourly wage for? Wiping down a table?  	 Don’t get me wrong, some waitresses are very nice and worth a little extra, but for all those who have been in the industry too long and have become bitter get a new job. And for all those who make mistakes because you’re too stupid, it’s not cute. And yes we are laughing at you for being so stupid. The minute you walk away we’re bitching about the crappy job you’re doing, but of course we’ll succumb and you leave that tip. It might not be as much, but it’ll still be there. 	 How hard is it to be a server? I don’t know, but from what the servers tell me it’s the worst experience in the world. The atmosphere is loud, it’s hard to hear orders and the smoke makes their eyes water. Ninety-nine per cent of them are smokers, so I don’t see what they’re bitching about. I have to say. Serving is probably the highest paid uneducated job. I think it should be mandatory for servers to go to serving school. If the job is as hard as they make it out to be, there should be some kind of education. Maybe a two year apprenticeship course at SAIT. I don’t think there’s enough to know for a four year degree, but a little actual training would be nice. A course at figuring out when to refill drinks, how to take orders, how many free shots can you accept and still serve at a decent level and how to properly flirt to maximize tips. All important skills.  	 I really believe every table should have a little electronic menu. The customer just presses a button and the food or drink has been ordered. The grub would come in a timely manner by a food runner. We could eliminate the position of server all together. It would save people money. Enough money, you could get another one or two drinks a night. That’s all anyone really wants is another couple drinks.  	 I advise everyone to be weary when they leave a tip. Actually think about what they did and what you’re paying them for. Here’s what I do. Fifty cents for every trip to the table. It’s twenty steps and usually they don’t have to do anything. An extra dollar for kindness. Be aware of the servers section. Is it busy? If it is, let a couple things slide. It’s not their fault management didn’t schedule enough workers. If it’s slow, they better be on top of shit. If they leave me with an empty drink, I leave them no tip. NO TIP. Don’t throw you’re money away on crappy service. Instead give me an email and I’ll let you know where to send it.  Remember, don’t drink and read comics. You’ll fuck up the spines and they’ll be worthless.

      Since Superman is my childhood hero, I fully believe he could complete a centurion (100 shots of beer in 100 minutes) no problem. He could shotgun a can of beer for each drink and still fly back to the fortress of solitude in a straight line. I’m guessing beer is Superman’s drink of choice. There's nothing better than a nice cold, frosty mug of ale, not lager, on a nice, hot sunny day in the city of Metropolis. I’m guessing Jerry Siegel would have him drinking a Budweiser, but Joe Shuster would put a case of Canadian beer in the superhero’s fridge.Yeah Canada. In a bar, Superman would be the guy playing golden tee, pool or darts. He is very competitive and needs to be the best at everything.  Batman could also pound back quite a few. He has mental problems and needs something to suppress the death of his parents, Robin 1 and 2 and all the people he couldn’t save. Hell, I’m surprised he’s not throwing up all over the batcave and wrapping the batmobile around lampposts throughout Gothem. I know I would. Batman seems like a rye guy. A glass of JD on the rocks. He likes the way Jack burns his throat on the way down. Batman would sit in his chair and drink. He’d think about all the ways to kick the shit out of the others sitting near him. 	 The Flash would always be the first one drunk. The drinks would warm his belly at a speed only matched by Superman. Flash does have a super metabolism which could hinder his attempts to get drunk, so I’m guessing he’d be a shot guy. One after the other, until they started to take effect. He’s a sissy so I’m guessing he’d order fuzzy navels and electric popsicles. Once drunk Flash wouldn’t shutup. He’d keep jibbering and jabbering until Batman knocked him out. 	 Why am I spouting off about the drinking habits of the greatest men on the planet? Well, this past weekend, I happened to witness one drunk superhero. He let his secret identity slip out for the world to see. After enough rye and beer to sufficiently buzz the average man, Joel became Disorientatedman. He can stumble to the ground quicker than the common drunk and has a hard time taking a piss at a urinal. Underneath his shirt, he has a wobbly DoM etched on his chest with black marker. He’s better known as the DoM to the regulars of the drunk tank.  	 I’ve heard the legend of a guy wandering around the streets of Rocky Mountain House in a disorganized fashion, but I didn’t believe them. Now, I know better. I never had the chance to see the famous acronym, but I saw the well-known stagger, the slurring and the reckless spending. I happened to see the DoM’s finishing move: the pass out. His eyes roll deep into the back of his skull, he emits a heavy laboured snoring noise to repel off intruders and he didn’t even use blankets. Blankets slow down his reaction time. What if someone needs a disorientating right away? I had suspicions that Joel was the DoM ever since my 18th birthday party; now I know for sure. I’m spreading his secret identity to everyone who reads this blog. Beware of the DoM. He’ll make you feel uninebriated and capable of driving. He’s so disorientated that you feel fine. 	 Where ever the DoM can be found, the Ball of Fury isn’t far away. He’s a 5 foot five inch being of pure blubber mixed in with a dash of rage. Mike Spoor is the man behind the anger. He’s fiercer than a snapping turtle and has the ferocious beak to match. He likes to yell and scream and isn’t afraid of crying. I’d like to give you a warning, but he’s hard to describe. He’s either Spanish, Mexican, Canadian or American. He has that lovable, kill-dem-all American attitude. The only person who can put a lid on the Ball of Fury’s incredible can of whupass is Hoser. They have a strange relationship. It could be a gay love affair or just two drinking buddies who never get out of the I love you stage. 	 After all the superhero sightings over the past weekend. I can’t wait to party like it’s June 12, 2004 again. With the help of my spindly little arms, I’m going to raise the roof. Whoop, Whoop.

      A relationship in the Joel-verse is not quite like a relationship in the real world. To illustrate my point, I've slapped together some panels from a couple of comics I've been reading. All thanks go to Grant Morrison, Phillip Bond, Cameron Stewart, and a group of inkers, colourers, and letterers I've forgot; even though this is without their express written consent. Oh yeah, this should go without saying but some people are idiots; this post will be very graphic intensive. Don't be a whiny bitch. Just wait, and watch brilliance unfold in front of your eyes.    So Without Further Ado...     The Beginning - Stasis Period : Relationship Inertia    The Courtship - First Contact ? Emotional Calculus    The Honeymoon Period - Unreality ! Synaptical Jazz    The End - Heart of Mind * Fatally Yours    The Aftermath - Female Agression + Affection Inverse     So there you go. It's only a matter of time before  urlLink Vertigo  comes and gang rapes me, so enjoy it while it lasts.

      I think Joel had a little too much catnip last night after work. I'm going to have to beat him like Williams beat Tyson. It'll take four rounds of pummling, but in the end Joel will fall face first on to the canvas and cry like a little girl. I'll raise my mighty fists skyward and hug my trainer, Van Dam.  Joel's bloodied, battered, bruised body will be swept over the edge of the ring, never to be found again.  Anyway, Bozzy's pool hall is shutting down in Rocky. It'll reopen in two weeks under the name of the Fish Bowl. It's not like I went to Bozzy's too often, but I'm not going to the fish bowl ever. What a crappy name.

          Hello everybody! This is Joel speaking. This is an historic day for our site, because Dane and I have decided to co-author a post! I have to admit that the excitement in the air is palpable. Why don't you say hi to the nice people, Dane?    Hey.    Oh c'mon, Dane; you can do better than that.    Hey moron, I didn't even wanna do this, so don't start co-depending me!    I think you mean condescend.    Damn it Joel! That's it, get out of my house. And stop inviting yourself over!    But I thought it'd be something cool for the blog!    This is the stupidest idea you've ever had.    And I even made cool little icons for us!    Who cares? I'm not a damn cat.    Watch it, you peckerhead...    No! Guess what? You're off the team! I'm out too! No blog!    What? You can't do that! I'm the administrator, you stupid asshole!    Fuck you! You piece of shit! Get the hell outta here! Where's that crowbar...    Damn it, why does this keep happening to me?

      I thought I'd mention this story for the last paragraph. It shows why criminals are criminals.   40 held hostage in Halifax robbery    Last Updated Fri, 30 Jul 2004 13:46:20 EDT    HALIFAX - About 40 employees of a big box store in Halifax were held hostage for more than three hours early Friday while a gang robbed the store.    Police said four or five armed and masked men entered the Costco store at about 3 a.m., taking the overnight staff hostage. They proceeded to tie up the early morning staff as they arrived for work between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m.    No one was hurt.    The robbers ransacked the store, taking a number of items including a large amount of cigarettes.    Police say they are looking for a cube van with a picture of a purple octopus on the side.    Written by CBC News Online staff   A picture of a purple octopus on the side. How inconspicuous. There must be millions of purple octopus sided vans driving around Halifax. Some people are just too stupid. They should be shot. There's no use for people like that in society. They might be able to handle a job at a convenience store. There's no way they could hold an occupation as strenuous as being a reporter.

      I have always respected the law. I fear the repercussions of breaking the law. I'm not sure&nbsp;I do&nbsp;anymore.   On Wednesday, I covered provincial court in Rocky Mountain House. Was I ever disappointed with our justice system. I've been a law abiding civilian my entire life. I don't have a criminal record. I do have two speeding tickets, which I paid in a timely manner.    What's the point?    The entire process was crap. Half of the names on the docket never showed. The afternoon trial was held over because the witness never appeared, and the lawyers were unorganized and unprofessional.   Three quarters of the charged had their court dates postponed. The quarter that did face the consequences of their actions received the minimum charge.   I was thoroughly disgusted with one case in particular. Ivan C. Beaverbones entered the local dollar store and attempted to steal some batteries. He was drunk and the staff caught him in the act. He had also cut himself and was bleeding all over the building. He received a $100 fine for the theft and another $100 fine for breech of probation, which he received for being drunk. He not supposed to drink and must attend AA meetings every week.   I would have been all right with the sentence had he been a first time offender. Beaverbones has a long list of criminal activity. He's a drunk criminal and even the prosecutor said he expects to see Ivan again real soon. "He's a nuisance and he'll be back." I'm starting to understand the 3-strike rule in California. We need to put some fear into the criminals again. The death sentence doesn't stop people from killing, but I'm sure it has decreased the numbers.  Anyway, Ivan left the courtroom smiling. He has no respect, so why should the average citizen who actually obeys society's rules?   I'm also trying to figure out the relationship between the population of natives in the area and the number that appear in court. There are five times the number on non-native people living in Rocky, but there are about the same amount of natives in court as non-natives. There were five members of the Beaverbones clan, two members of the Goodrunning family, two Redbears among others. I hope this is a Rocky anomaly. If this is the case everywhere, something has to be changed.   I will give them some credit. They all showed up. They know how the system works even if they don't care for it.   I always thought justice was an all powerful being. A godlike figure,&nbsp;who slams&nbsp;his gavel down. Now I believe he is more of a withered, battered old man, who has seen too much and just doesn't care.

      I got a nice chuckle out of this story when I first read it. I found the article at cnn.com. What are her great-grandkids going to think?  I have to say this is one criminal Dane and Joel might have a chance at beating up.   ROME, Italy (Reuters)     &nbsp;  Italian police have arrested an 80-year-old great-grandmother suspected of drugging and robbing easily fooled victims for years to feed her gambling habit.    Vittoria Benetti was detained after her last victim, a 70-year-old woman travelling in the same train compartment, identified her in a photo, Italian media reported Saturday.    Benetti drugged her with a cup of coffee and then escaped with 1,000 euros ($1,226) which she promptly spent at a casino in neighboring Slovenia.    Benetti's criminal record for a string of frauds and swindles and her obsession for gambling made it easy for the police to track her down, newspapers said.    &nbsp; I guess prison is just about as bad as an old-folks home. The difference is the abondoned, retired old people have pensions and life savings. Prisoners have cigarettes. She'd probably have more fun swindling all the inheritance out of the senile fools at the care centre, not the jail.  &nbsp;

      As you're most likely aware, I've not been posting on this site for some time now. This was mainly because I was too busy working on the 52nd Post Spectacular for the other site. And hey, if you haven't read it yet, what the hell are you doing here? Go read it. I've received word that people have found it quite funny, and it even has interviews with both Dane AND Steve Smith, our mysterious benefactor. Shameless plug over.  Back to business. I've been away, and I return to the site today to find that Dane has turned himself into an angry, charismatic prophet of some kind; announcing that the animals are quickly going to take over Earth and subject us humans to their iron-willed tyranny. Although I - having an as yet unmatched loathing for all of humankind - would not be upset if those events were to unfold, I must say that Dane really needs to stop smoking peat moss.  Step one of the reconstruction of this site is now complete.

      It's right out of Orwell's Animal Farm. Monkies will be the new humans. I hope the other critters are able to see that the monkies are going to screw them over.   Jerusalem - A young monkey at an Israeli zoo has started walking like a human after a near-death experience.  The zoo's veterinarian said Natasha, a small five-year-old black macaque monkey at the Safari Park next to Tel Aviv, began walking exclusively upright after a stomach ailment nearly killed her.Monkeys usually alternate between upright movement and walking on all fours.   A picture in the Ma'ariv newspaper on Wednesday showed Natasha standing ramrod straight like a human. The picture was humorously labelled "The missing link?"  "I've never seen or heard of this before. One possible explanation is brain damage from the illness," veterinarian Igal Horowitz said.   Sapa-AP  Beware

      CBC   Lesbian couple seeking country's first same-sex divorce   Last Updated Wed, 21 Jul 2004 11:44:04 EDT   TORONTO - A lesbian couple in Ontario may face problems getting what is believed to be Canada's first same-sex divorce because the law limits divorce to male-female couples.   Martha McCarthy   INDEPTH:  urlLink Same-sex Rights    The two women, identified only as M.M. and J.H., were married in Ontario on June 18, 2003, a week after Ontario's Court of Appeal legalized same-sex marriage.  They separated five days later.   RELATED:  urlLink Ottawa to recognize same-sex marriages    However, the Divorce Act, which is federal legislation, defines spouses as "either of a man or a woman who are married to each other."   Toronto lawyer Martha McCarthy and her client, M.M. have asked the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to issue an order that the federal definition of spouse under the Divorce Act is unconstitutional. She said the federal government is due to respond next week.   "It's unconstitutional to give straight people the freedom to divorce, and not gays and lesbians," said McCarthy.   She said she has written to the federal government asking it not to fight their court challenge.  "In September, there could be gay marriage and gay divorce in the province of Ontario," said McCarthy.   The Ontario court was the first to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada. British Columbia, Quebec and the Yukon soon followed.   The federal government referred a draft bill changing the definition of marriage to the Supreme Court for its consideration. Hearings on the issue are scheduled to begin this fall.

      Goats now have the ability to spin webbing. It's part two in the animals taking over the world. Birds lighting entire forests on fire in California&nbsp;and now goats that can trap humans in webs. The main thing that sucks is that we're giving the goats these incredible abilities.  &nbsp;  Here's a piece of the article I found on the BBC's website.  (Dane originally posted a link&nbsp;to the article here, but since he's an inbred twit with no regard for proper formatting, I&nbsp;deleted it to&nbsp;return the page to it's former nicely-formatted glory. Since Dane is a journalist you would think he would have a grasp on the fact that there's only a limited space to work with. But I guess not. - Joel) &nbsp;   In an unlikely coupling, genetic engineers have now bred goats that have spider silk genes inside them. By doing this, they can harvest the silk proteins from the goat's milk (silky milk, anyone?). The silk gene was just one of 70,000 that make up the DNA blueprint for building a normal goat.   In adult female goats, the silk gene is activated only while the animal is producing milk. One goat can produce about 7g of silk per day.      Spiders in space and surgery      &nbsp;   Called 'biosteel', the silk is lighter, yet tougher than Kevlar, and nearly as elastic as nylon. It could be used in medical supplies, space equipment and bullet-proof vests.  So there's a new superhero in town. Swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper, fighting crime as it shoots jets of silk from its udders, it's Spider-Goat!   &nbsp;  The author thinks the entire thing is a joke. I can't believe it. He won't be laughing for too much longer.  &nbsp;  I've noticed that&nbsp;Joel was harboring a small force of&nbsp;terrorist animals at his trailer.&nbsp;Now they're all heading their separate ways&nbsp;to lead larger forces in the destruction of&nbsp;mankind. I wouldn't be surprised if Joel trained&nbsp;them himself. After three years of dealing with people&nbsp;at Rolf's, he's begun to despise all people and wants to kill them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Damn you Joel. Damn You.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  By the way everyone should check out his 52 post extravaganza at  urlLink http://www.brokencontroller.blogspot.com/ . It's pretty funny.

      I saw this on CNN’s website. It had me worried.   "The wildfire began when a red-tailed hawk hit power lines and caught fire, said Jim Dellamonica, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The bird fell to the ground, setting plants on fire, he said. Helicopters dropped water on hillsides, seeking to halt the Foothill blaze's spread."   The fire is still raging. I think this could be the start of the apocalypse. Animals are going to destroy the human world and kill everyone in it. &nbsp;They seem willing to sacrifice themselves. We're doomed.  I’ll keep this post short so everyone doesn’t get into a panic. I suggest&nbsp;everyone should try and go about their daily lives and let the end come. It’s no use trying to fight. We’re horribly outnumbered.

      On Monday night, I saw one of the nastiest sights I’ve ever seen. It was horrible. All the gyrating, fake smiles and jiggling. What did I do to deserve that punishment? I’m scarred. Terribly, terribly scarred. It was worse than seeing Court’s dance in an Amsterdam nightclub. I’ll try and get Joel to perform the dance and have to downloaded onto the site, but we’ll see. It wasn’t pretty.   Where did I go? What did I see? You ask.   It was Monday, 9 p.m. I went to the bottom bar, and I had my first encounter with a Rocky Mountain House stripper. I don’t think I’ve ever been so disgusted. She didn’t put any effort into her routine, which would have made the show bearable. She looked bad and everything else that could suck, did. I was only there to meet my girlfriend and play some pool. If only I had known. My sheltered life made me believe strippers were supposed to look good.   How I rate strippers?   1) Appearance. Yes, I’m superficial. I like to see good looking strippers. I don’t mind fake breasts. I’m not going to touch them anyway, so they might as well look good. I’m not asking for a life sized Barbie. I actually prefer athletic girls. Piercings are nice, but too many isn’t good. Not for me.  No one wants to see ugly people get naked. It’s alcohol’s job to make ugly people bearable. Covering them up with clothes is also a good idea. Lots and lots of thick baggy clothing. I myself have numerous hoodies that I frequently wear.   2) Performance. I like strength moves. I like Pole tricks, acrobatics and flexibility. Good dancing is a must. The performance should be fluid and not at all awkward. Music is key. I like loud, heavy and fast. I don’t really like the ladies who play the top 40. The louder and faster the music the more the crowd gets pumped up and excited.  They might not want to get the drunk, dirty bastards all rowdied up, but they’ll make more money.   3) Enthusiasm. I like a stripper who enjoys getting up and being naked in front of a bunch of horny bastards. At least pretend. They should look like they want to be up there. I don’t care if they have to do a couple lines, smoke a joint or down a bunch of shots, but they need to look like they’re having fun. They can’t flinch when loonies are tossed at them. It just looks stupid.   4) Bonuses. It’s always great when there are more than one on stage at once. A shower is great. Prizes are a must. Posters, key chains, videos, etc... You need somthing to remember the ladies by.  Rocky’s stripper didn’t have anything. The music I guess was okay, but that’s it. She was old. I’d guess she was about 40. She could hold a handstand for ten seconds, but didn’t use the pole or confirm her flexibility. She made a lousy $6 dollars in loonies.   I always wondered what happened to strippers when they got too old. They go on a small town circuit. They travel around to crappy locations and take their clothes off. I always hoped they quite and find a waitress job.   Maybe my standards are too high. I’ve only seen Calgary strippers. It’s very competitive and only the best remain. The rest exchange occupations or join the minor leagues. I’ve also seen the stripper in Powell River. A town about the size of Rocky. She looked good, but couldn’t dance. If she could, she probably could have been making the big bucks in Vancouver or Victoria.  &nbsp; I've managed to come to grips with the nasty stripper. I blocked it from my thoughts for a week and needed a form of release. This is it. I warn everyone to stay away from the strippers in a small town.

      Are you looking for some Bloom County? I sure hope so, because that's all I've got to give you today. Perhaps if I show a bunch of strips and spread the County love, the good folks who own the rights will see fit to reprint the entire canon. And that'll be just like a sloppy kiss on a rainy day. With a helping of boysenberry pie.  For the benefit of the ignorant jackasses or those people who hated Spider-Man 2 (although those two things aren't mutually exclusive) I should give a reminder that you need to click on the picture to view the strip at full size.  A bit of commentary for the first strip: I've already shown it to a certain somebody who said the part of the rabbit sums up their entire political career. No points for guessing who it is.    urlLink      urlLink

      It was a hot summer day, and Joel and Dane were cruising around Rocky. The black ‘83 Chevette was hot, the AM radio cranked out the sounds of the oldies, and the sweat stains were appearing in the armpit regions of their superhero costumes. It was almost time for a free slurpee from Rolf’s.  They took a final tour down main street, the hub of the action in the small town. If there was crime prevention needed, it was on main street. Dane was looking for villainous activity, while Joel’s eyes were perusing, peering, probing the area for scantily clad women. Joel was in heat and on the prowl. Watch out ladies.  The pair had already saved one kid from the perils of J-walking. A new daily record would be established if they foiled two more crimes.   “If only the cops would do their job,” Joel muttered. He was pissed because he didn’t get to go to Sylvan Lake to admire all the uncovered flesh. “I wouldn’t have to be in this hot car, in this skin-tight suit, patrolling a boring town.”  “We have powers that have to be used for the good of the world,” Dane said trying to calm the easily irritable Joel. “You know you need to use your editing skills to further mankind, not to destroy the already fragile planet.” Dane had become very concerned about Earth once he heard about the atrocities in Iraq and the Liberals winning the federal election. He still couldn’t believe they were true.  Joel on the other hand didn’t know what to think. He knew his powers could help eradicate evil, but he also knew the world was weak and his for the taking. It was then that his dream girl walked down the street. Silky, brown hair flowed over her tanned shoulders. Long legs jutted out of a pair of cutoff shorts and her low-cut shirt was too much. Joel got out of the car and strutted over to her. The kind of strut only a superhero wearing a mask could execute. Dane had never seen Joel do anything this perposterous sincehe puked on some guy’s shoes in the old Republic.  Unfortunately, he hadn’t quite planned out the scenario. He wanted to say something, but couldn’t. His voice froze; he couldn’t force out a word. He just stuttered. It was an incomprehensible mumble. His face went red and a puddle formed at the bottom of his right leg. Joel ran in horror. He flipped a manhole cover and fled into the sewer.  In the background the only sound was laughter. Dane fell out of the driver’s side door and couldn’t stop laughing. Tears steamed down his face, and his sides burst. The pain and misery of his friends made his life worth living. A car quickly turned in beside the Chevette and cranked Dane in the head. Everything went black.  The girl didn’t know what to think and continued on her way. Her thoughts were on the bald clerk from Rolf’s who sold her a Hershey bar the night prior.

      The judge sits high on his perch, gavel in hand. His bloodshot eyes peer down upon me. My hands are bound in cuffs at crotch level. I give myself a quick scratch before he hands down his sentence. The room must have increased in temperature by 20 degrees. Sweat drips down in between my ass cheeks and collects in my boxerbriefs. Everyone is waiting for the judgment, especially me.   With his comments, my life changes. Will I feel his wrath or will I leave a man with a free mind? The hulking judge slowly opens his mouth, saliva threads tear apart as his lips separate. Here it comes. The words vibrate along his vocal cords and the sound waves reach my ears.  “Very good,” says the judge. “You’ve met or exceeded all expectations.”   (I love my thesaurus. Another word for vibration is vibration. Stupid Webster’s English thesaurus.)  I let out a sigh of relief. My body begins to fill with pleasantness. I feel like Joel does when Rolf gives him a gold star for his excellent work ethic. I feel as good as a kid does when they are rewarded for wiping their own ass. I feel good.  Today was my midway evaluation. I wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. I’ve been going through the motions, but there’s been nothing to really challenge me. No tests. Everything is small and fairly easy. I haven’t had to deal with any serious, controversial topics. But really, are there many in a small town? If there are, another one of the reporters is on top of the story.   I’ll get a good review, which hopefully means a good evaluation, which lands me a good job, which means a happy life. I’d really like a happy life. I don’t know exactly what I’ll be doing to keep me happy, but I’ll found out soon enough.

      Giving someone the finger is the typical gesture of offense. We don’t bite our thumbs anymore, like in Romeo and Juliet, but I think we should rekindle the art of snooking. To snook is to perform a rude gesture made as a sign of contempt, thumb on the nose and fingers out-stretched. It was the primary signal of insult in the late 18th century.   I also feel we should reinstate the glove-smack-to-the-face challenge. If you are going to fight, you have to make it clear. You can’t just sucker punch someone. There needs to be some sort of code again. I’m not a fighter, but I’ve been hit in the head a couple of times. Most were a result of what I said and should have known it was coming, but on one occasion that wasn’t the case.   I was drunk in a bar. It was the Metro in Calgary. Another drunk blamed me for spilling his beer. He told me to buy him another one. I refused and walked away. My friend, Cartwright was talking with one of the bouncers. He was actually trying to pick up a beer tub girl, but ended up talking to the other staff member standing beside her. Anyway I went over and joined in the conversation.   It was a $1.50 high ball night and I was having a great time. As this other drunk guy walked past, he asked if we were tattling to the bouncer on him. I said no, and seconds after his fist hit my face twice. His buddy hit Cartwright once before the bouncer jumped in and escorted the evil duo out. No damage was done to my face. I got a free beer and everything was all good.  Cartwright and I wandered around the place looking for people we knew. All of the sudden the pair was back in the bar and had spotted us. They came in through the front. The doorman didn’t know they had been thrown out because they were escorted through a side door. Anyway, they came right up to us. Cartwright bolted. One guy grabbed my arms, while the other drove his knuckles into my head. I managed to tuck my chin into my neck so I took the brunt of the hits with forehead. I wouldn’t doubt that he broke a knuckle on my thick skull. I suffered a cut in my right eyebrow, and was asked to leave. I still have a small scar to this day. Cartwright was already outside. We got in a cab and headed home.  The next day I had a hangover and Cartwright had a story about how he scared the two off. His buddy Chad asked me what really happened? Did he run? Yep. Anyone that knew him, knew he was full of crap. But the story he told was a lot better than I got my ass kicked while he ran story. So, I didn’t really care.

      As I promised/threatened before, I was going to write an installment in the adventures of Drunk Man and Bug Guy or whatever the hell their names are. And here it is! Now you may go about your business now that the Master of Brilliant Awesomeness has blessed you. Of course, after you're done with him, you could always read this. Issue 0, hitting blogstands now!  But before I start, I'd just... screw it, I'll save it for another post. Enjoy!         It was a dark, or a stormy, or perhaps a dark and stormy night. Lightning crashed, which pissed off the thunder, because apparently only thunder is supposed to crash. They bitched at each other for a while then whisped away to the atmosphere, leaving behind a stench of ozone. The suicidal rain drops fell to the earth and burst apart on impact, leaving behind streams of watery gore. Newsprint blackness was smeared over the landscape and was everywhere. Except in one area, where it was washed away by two thin streams of light.  A small black car slid sharply around the corner of the gravel road. It began to drift and soon found itself hurtling into a tree. It crashed, as expected. Three rather large branches came down with a thud on the hood. And then, all was quiet. All was still. For a few moments anyway, for loud screaming came from inside the car. Soon after, the passenger side door opened.  "...Ing ASSHOLE!!! FUCK! FUCK FUCKITY FUCK FUCK FUCK!! WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!!" yelled Joel as he stepped outside. The driver side door opened, then Dane stepped outside as well. "Calm down, Joel. This car cost us thirty bucks. Those new red pens you bought cost more than that. And look! We're in the driveway of my house!" "CALM DOWN?! I'LL CALM DOWN AFTER I'VE URINATED ON YOUR CORPSE, YOU FUCKING WACKADOO!"  Dane calmly took a cigarette out of his pocket and shoved it in Joel's mouth. Before Joel could react, Dane grabbed his lighter and lit it. Joel immediately inhaled half the cigarette, then crumpled into a heap on the road. Dane shook his head, grabbed Joel's arms, and dragged him towards the house.  After ten minutes of arduous pulling, Dane zipped up his pants and went into the living room to see if Joel was still alive after he had threw him on the couch twenty minutes earlier. He went back into the kitchen after he saw Joel muttering about "all the pretty puppies". Damn, Dane thought to himself, all this pulling has worn me out. I'm used to pushing things! Before he could curl up on the table and go to sleep, he was confronted by his girlfriend, Famira!  "So, I'm still not good enough for your little adventures, am I?" she sneered. Dane lept to his feet, opened a cupboard, and hid behind it's door. "It's just that you don't have any powers, sweetie!" stammered Dane. "What, like you guys? WOW, the ability to get drunk. That's a showstopper. And being able to push things?" "Dammit, Famira; I have a gift! I push well! And with a bit of power, comes a little responsibility!" shouted Dane as he stood up and raised his fist to the ceiling. Famira shook her head. "Dane, I have a secret to tell you. You didn't get bitten by a radioactive dung beetle. You got bitten by a radioactive spider. But besides making you sterile, it didn't do anything for you." "But... but what about Anthony? I pushed him into in a little ball!" "Oh, him. Well, it turns out he was just a big sissy." "And why the big story about the dung beetle?" "Because, dear, if I told you you were bitten by a radioactive spider you would've tried jumping from buildings and stuff. This at least kept you safe on the ground." "But I have no powers!" "Do you need powers to be a hero?" "Hmmm... I guess not... wait a minute, what the fuck am I saying?! Of course you need powers to be a hero! Does Superman save a busful of screaming passengers from going off a cliff by talking nice to the bus?" "Sigh... you don't get it." "No! You know what I don't I get? How you appeared out of nowhere! You're supposed to be at work right now! And you don't even sound like you usually do! You don't talk like that! What the hell is going on?"  Famira suddenly began to flicker. She was an image, projected from some unknown source.  "HA HA HA! That's right! I'm not Famira! And this is the end of the line for you!"  To Be Continued!!!

      Alone in his room, Joel was reading a comic. He held the comic with his left hand and in his right was a red, fine-tipped, felt pen. The ashtray sitting on his night stand, only an arm’s reach away, was now empty. It was usually heaped with discarded cigarette butts. A desk lamp positioned over his right shoulder was the only source of light. A little of the light radiated back into his face from a mirror hanging on the wall.   Suddenly a quack startled the confused superhero. His head snapped up to glance out the window. Only a hazy full moon was visible. Joel’s quick thinking registered the noise and matched it with it’s only possible source.  “Damn duck,” Joel muttered, a bit of saddness jolted his heart for the duck that went missing two weeks prior. He was about to return to his comic when he caught a glimse of himself in the mirror.  “Who am I?” Joel asked himself. I’m Disorientedman no more. He looked at the red pen in his hand. Joel thought maybe he could become the editor and correct the mistakes of bad men. He couldn’t help himslef from correcting the shoddy grammar in his comic books and the Mountaineer was absolutely horrible. Joel dispised the writter with the byline Aaron Dane Lutz. He still believed his partner in crime fighting, Dane Lutz, was somehow related.  He also knew of the power of addiction. The empty ashtray reminded Joel of how great it felt to suck on the filter of a DuMuarier light kingsize. His need began to grow. He wished there was a villan in front of him, so he could kick a little ass. Lately the only people feeling the effects of his smokless life style were the customers at Rolf’s.   On Sunday evening to piss his customers off, he pretended to be out of the most popular brand of nic-sticks. He laughed in the face of one lady as she swipped a container of chocolates all over the counter. It was a malicious cackle. It was not one of a superhero, but one that belonged to the most mischievious evil-doer Rocky has ever seen.  Could this be the end for our courageous superhero? Could this be the demise of Joel as a goodguy? Is this the beginning of a new force of evil?   Tune in next time. Same blog internet address. Same crazy blog title.

      It wasn’t a position he usually found himself in. Well maybe one or two times before. He was fighting evil with a tire wrench. Mud dripped down his face. He wiped the sludge from his eyes and cleaned his hand on his Dung Beetle Guy uniform. The uniform he wore when he crushed badness into a ball and threw it in a trash can. This particular devil landed DBG in a mud puddle on a rainy day. He had a flat tire.  “What the hell is taking so long?” Inquired the ex-Disorientedman from the passenger seat of the goodmobile. They hadn’t agreed on a decent name for their mode of transportation. It was a black 1983 Chevette.   Since sobering up, Joel was having an identity crisis. He couldn’t decide whether he was the all powerful Editor or if he wanted to be Nicfit. Joel had just quit smoking and was having a rough time. He could, however, turn that nicotine free ferociousness on anyone who got in his way.  “Shut up you lazy bastard,” replied DBG, a vein was starting to pop out of his neck and his eye began to spasm. “With one push, I could send this car into orbit and it’d be your casket for all eternity,” DBG whispered under his breath as a smile crossed his lips.  “What was that?” Joel asked. He heard some mumbling but couldn’t quite make out the words.  “Nothing. You sit in the nice warm car and relax. You stupid cunt,” said DBG. The tire iron pressed against the nut and with a little effort began to spin. “Ha ha. I’ve triumphed again.” Soon all four of the bolts were on the ground. DBG pulled off the flat and tossed on the itty-bitty spare. He fastened the nuts back in place, released the jack, tossed the ruined tire in the trunk and hopped back behind the wheel. They were off to Kal-tire.  Evil was vanquished for yet, another day.

      Those of you new to our site probably have some questions cranking the hamster wheel in your brain; and I have no doubt that number one on your list of inquiries is this: Just what the hell do we look like? Mostly to know who you're looking for when you finally decide to make Darwin's theories more "pro-active", I'm guessing. Well, tough luck, assholes! AH HA HA HAH!   Ahem.  Barring the pictures on our logo, the pictures of us in our posts and the spiffy animated GIF in our sidebar, we're just not that well represented image-wise on our site. I decided to rectify this  tout de suite .     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   We're ready for our close-ups, Mr. DeMille.    Well, I hope that helps when you make the trip to Rocky to pop some caps in our ignorant asses. We'll be eating cupcakes and watching Winnie the Pooh until then.  Now on to the first edition of Dane's Relevant Links!  Now hold on, you're saying. You, Jam-Master Joel, are writing this post. Why the hell is it Dane's Relevant Links, then? Because, my simple friend, when Dane recommends a link, it is Relevant. When I recommend a link, it is Useless. Read the damn sidebar. Since these links are actually somewhat relevant, I'm acting as a proxy for Dane until such time when he is in a capacity to recommend them himself. At the moment Dane is currently holding hands with his girlfriend or brushing her hair or perhaps engaging in any number of wholesome activities that boys and girls do together nowadays. I don't know, I took a vow of celibacy two years ago; not as an expression of any beliefs, mind you, but more as a way to justify my social life or lack thereof. But that's neither here nor there.  I'd really like to claim that I created the images above and the images in our header myself, but then I'd be lying. And liars make cuddly kittens cry while Jesus plots to literally shit in their cereal. Or something. Anyways, I made them with the help of some avatar creation programs I managed to find while trolling the Interweb. Kudos goes to  urlLink Heroine X  for being the person whose post about them I found first.      urlLink Portrait Illustration Maker  - Used to make the images contained in this post. Not that pretty of a system, really; but there's lots of things to play around with.   urlLink Dookyweb  - Used to make the images in the logo. Nice and easy! Less options than the one above, though.    Up next: Joel attempts to write a chapter in the saga of Drunk Guy and Bug Man, or whatever the hell their names are.

      It was a great day for me. I've never experienced the excitement and pleasure before. Today was my first time being bitched at because someone didn't agree with my column in the paper. It was my first column, but hopefully I have many more angry readers calling into the paper.   I'm sure Joel will tell you my column title sucks, but his recommendation was too clever and no one got it.    (Admin's Note: It was "A Paradigm Shifting Without A Clutch.")   I wrote about Todd Bertuzzi being charged. I don't think he should have been. Anyway, the guy on the other end of the phone started going off and I just listened. I countered every time he said something I didn't agree with.  The conversation ended with him complimenting me on my opinion piece. It's nice to see that I've got people talking.   (Admin's Note: In case you're curious about his editorial, I've typed it below. Yes, I have no life.)     Dane States His Case   Bertuzzi, what did you do?   On Thursday, June 24, Todd Bertuzzi was charged with assault causing bodily harm for his vicious on-ice attack directed at Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche. Moore suffered a broken neck and a concussion. It is still unknown whether he'll play next season. The incident at GM Place ocurred three and a half months ago in front of 18,000 fans.  The league acted quick and fierce. Bertuzzi was suspended for the final 13 games of the season. He missed the Canucks' seven post-season games. He lost more than $500,000 in salary. The Canucks were also fined $250,000 for the clubbing from behind. Bertuzzi wasn't selected for Team Canada at the World Hockey Championships in August, because the league hasn't reinstated Bertuzzi making him eligible to play. Now, he faces the possibility of jail time. It's too much.  The attack was terrible and deserved discipline. The league was taking care of it. Now, Bertuzzi has a lot more to worry about. The maximum penalty depends on how the Crown proceeds. Bertuzzi faces a maximum penalty of 18 months in provincial jail. Or if the Crown chooses to go the path of indictment, Bertuzzi could spend the rest of his NHL career in jail. The Supreme Court could send him away for a maximum of 10 years.  Jail time is unnecessary. Bertuzzi has been punished enough. Plus, how much punishment is going to be handed down? The Marty McSorley stick-upside-the-head incident received an 18-month conditional discharge, after being convicted of assault.  In 1998, Dino Ciccarelli was sentenced to one day in jail and fined $1,000 Cdn. for striking Luke Richardson in the head with his stick.  One more. In 1982, Jimmy Mann, Winnipeg Jets enforcer, left the bench and clocked Penguin's Paul Gardner. Mann broke Gardner's jaw in two places. The penalty was a $500 fine and a suspended sentence.  Whatever sentence the courts hand out pales in comparison to what his suspension has done to the Canucks. Bertuzzi could have been the difference in the first round of the playoffs. He could have scred the game winning goal in Game 7 to send the Canucks on to Round 2. He could have had the influence to extinguish the pesky flames before Game 7. It could have been the Canucks battling the Tampa Bay Lightning for the Stanley Cup. It could have been Vancouver's year. Now they'll never know.  The league has to look at ways to keep a similar occurence from happening again. I suggest they eliminate the instigator rule. A player who tries to fight an unwilling combatant is ejected from the game with the possibility of suspension. Before the instigator rule an enforcer could protect the team's star players. Bertuzzi's attack on Moore was in retaliation for a controversial bodycheck. In a previous game Moore injured Vancouver captain Marcus Naslund. Vancouver wanted to punish Moore for the hit. Bertuzzi was the one who acted.  Bertuzzi didn't drop the gloves and hit Moore face to face because of the instigator rule. Instead he chose to hit Moore from behind and take him to the ice, breaking Moore's neck. If Moore had skated away, the play would have likely resulted in a roughing call, and maybe a suspension. It wouldn't have been nearly as long as the one he's serving now.  The terrible assault never should have happened and the penalties could become even more sever with a conviction.

      If you've been paying attention to our "Complaints" section, you probably know that Sports Ross has expressed interest in joining our little site here. At first, I thought "Na..." but after thinking it through for a bit it seemed like it might be a good idea. I asked Dane about it, but he gurgled then passed out on the floor, so that wasn't much help. So, gentle readers, I'm putting it to you. Should The Dazzling Sports Ross join our team? Or do you prefer that we stay a duo? Leave a complaint and let us know!

      It’s a hot day. I’m sitting on my leather sofa in a wife-beater and some Umbro soccer shorts. Sweat drips deep into every crevice of my body. It’s irritating. I pick up a nice, cool Pepsi-cola and take a drink. The flavoured water tantalizes my taste buds and tickles my esophagus before it splashes and intermingles with my stomach acids.  Ahhhhhhhhh. I release a sigh of delight. My body temperature decreases to a tolerable level.  Man do I love Pepsi-Cola.  My eyes focus on the television set in front of me. It’s a 36-inch Sony. I won it at a cock fight in dark recesses of the old Mountainview Hotel.  Charlie, a scrawny year-old pecker, was pitted against Samson, who was undefeated in 22 matches. The odds were 50-1, and I didn’t believe Charlie even had that good of a chance.  But, what the hell? I gave a loonie to the crazy, Mexican, one-thumbed bookie. Mike was his name. I wasn’t totally convinced he was Mexican. He could have been Spanish, or even some messed-up hybrid.  Anyway, I went over to Charlie. I gave him a quick stroke on the back and the fucker took a chunk out of my hand. Blood spew all over my lucky plaid shirt. I almost stomped on the bird’s head, but didn’t. I realized the chicken-legged rooster had heart and therefore a chance. I placed nine more dollars on the small feathered animal. I felt lucky.  The bell rang and Rigo, Charlie’s owner, dropped his competitor in the pit. Samson charged Charlie, but the underdog jived to the right. He quickly pounced on the behemoth’s back and ripped at his jugular. Blood sprayed straight up into the air. Two bystanders were drenched in red. Samson didn’t last 20 seconds in his 23rd fight and first defeat.  It took two trainers to pull the psycho chicken off the lifeless mass. I swear I saw Charlie spit on the carcass as he left the ring. I won $500, but instead of cash I took the Sony. I wanted to watch some Blue Jays baseball that weekend and the 13-inch set just wouldn’t do. Man do I love Sony television sets.  A chime sounds. I look over from my spot on the leather sofa. It’s the cat clock. The tail swings every second and the clock face is where its body should be. I remember when I first hung that clock on my wall.  It was a dark night, and I was loitering outside the bingo hall. Some old people came out, one had an oxygen bottle. They started taunting me and my gang, the stick breakers. My gang got the name because we’d break really thick sticks to intimidate our enemies. We challenged the seniors to some fist-a-cuffs in the alley. They obliged.  I took out my stick. SNAP! Their old eyes bugged out. I could read the fear on their faces. My posse backed me up. We charged. Punches were thrown and received. Blood splattered, and dentures flew.  Then the lights went out. I guess my crew took off when their leader went uncoscious. I awoke in a pile of trash. My head throbbed and I had a small mountain on the back of my head. I had no doubt it was a cheap shot from an oxygen battle. I stood up, dusted myself off and started walking home. But before I left, I picked up a cat clock that just happened to be in the same trash pile I was in. And some people don’t believe in fate. I nailed the clock to the wall the instant I got home.  I wanted to get revenge on those old people and restore my honour, but they all died before I could. I had the sweet satisfaction knowing two suffered slow painful cancerous deaths.  Man do I love cat clocks.  With a can of Pepsi-cola by my side, the sound of the Jays game on my Sony and the ticking of the tail on my cat clock, I take an afternoon nap.  Man do I love afternoon naps.

      Without Joel, I have no one to tell me what to do. For the past four days, I've been sitting on the couch, wearing pajama pants, eating chips and cursing the television set. I haven't been to work since last Friday, and the damn phone calls are starting to piss me off. I have crumbs scattered throughout the hair on my chest and I need someone to wipe my ass.   Where the fuck is Joel?      Jooooooooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!     I'm starting to go insane. The animals are talking to me. They're inviting me to an all-night kegger in Leslieville.  Damn it. There's some scratching at the door. I'll be right back.  ............  Sorry guys, Dane is one of us now. Drink your beer Dane. Use the funnel Dane. Say goodbye Dane.  bye.

        Hey everybody, this is Dane. I decided to invite Joel back over to my house so we could write another post together. Say hey, Joel.    Hey guys! How's it going? It's great to back here, even though the last time we tried this it ended up with Dane swinging a crowbar while chasing me down a country lane. But you know, that's why pencils have erasers. It's all water under the bridge. We got over it, and let bygones be by-    Quit it.    Oops, sorry. Why don't you lead off the discussion, Dane? We've got some good topics to talk about today! Like how to make a decent egg salad, or what the best Winnie the Pooh cartoon short is, or even what the price of r-    Why the fuck were you writing about my  urlLink girlfriend?     Oh! Um, I see that Dane has, um, chosen a meaningful issue to er, debate.    Can it, shithead! Give me one good reason not kick your ass!    Dane, I merely wrote that to help clear up some misconceptions we had about each other.    What, her "misconception" that you're a douchebag? That did fat fuck-all!    Hey, we can act like two grown men and not resort to names... oh, who am I kidding, YOU FUCKING FRUIT! That's it! It's go time!         Huh... wheeze...    Wheeze... pant...    So are we cool?    I know I am. You sure as hell aren't!    WHAT?!         Heeeey, eveeereeebodeee! I'm drunk on punch!    Um... where's my ear?

      Thanks to my investigative journalism, the Pentagon is now aware of the animal threat level. They are implementing programs to stop the attack. Here is some proof. It's the top two paragraphs of an article on the Globe and Mail's website.    Pentagon tests directed-energy weapons  By MICHAEL P. REGAN Associated Press    A few months from now, Peter Anthony Schlesinger hopes to zap a laser beam at a couple of chickens or other animals in a cage a few dozen yards away. If all goes as planned, the chickens will be frozen in mid-cluck, their leg and wing muscles paralyzed by an electrical charge created by the beam, even as their heart and lungs function normally.    Among those most interested in the outcome will be officials at the Pentagon, who helped fund Mr. Schlesinger's work and are looking at this type of device to do a lot more than just zap the cluck out of a chicken. Devices like these, known as directed-energy weapons, could be used to fight wars in coming years.   These new ray guns will allow people to harm the animals, but not kill them. We have to crush the attack, but don't want to destroy our food supply.

      I found this little bit of news on the BBC's website and thought I'd give everyone a warning.  I don't want people to hear the new slogan and crumble to their knees wondering what had happened. I don't want people thinking that they've been transported to a strange parallel dimension. Be prepared. Change isn't always good.    Ad slogan has a break - for good     One of the most recognizable slogans in advertising history - "Have a break, have a KitKat" - is to be dropped after 47 years.    Manufacturer Nestle Rowntree has said it will roll out a new tagline - "Make the most of your break" - next month.    KitKat's first television commercial launched the famous tagline in 1957.    Andrex toilet roll is also reported to be replacing its 32-year-old "Soft, strong and long" slogan with the tagline, "Tuggable, huggable softness".     Why did they have to mess with a good thing? It's stupid and won't do anything. Kit Kat's ad people just wanted to make it look like they're doing something.  The second slogan change was a good idea. Joel already has numerous sexual innuendos pumping, thrusting and grinding through his head.

      I'd like to formally announce to the world that Dane has a girlfriend. They've been dating for over a year now. This really shouldn't come as a surprise; after all, he's the studliest guy to ever wield a camera in the entire span of human existence. What, you think a man that chock-full of machismo wouldn't have a girlfriend? Wouldn't spend every waking hour alone? Wouldn't see his dreams drown in cigarette butts and empty bottles of Pepsi? [sniff] Wouldn't be posting his worthless thoughts for the perusal of the uncaring sacks of hatred and gristle who visit his sites out of pity? WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH THE STREAMS OF TEARS CASCADING DOWN HIS SALLOW FACE!?  Ahem. *cough*  Anyway, Dane has a girlfriend. And ever since I met her, things have been rather weird. For some odd reason, both of us think that the other doesn't like them. So, I'd like to announce that I don't hate Dane's girlfriend, Famira. Actually, she's really cool! She's awesome! She's funny! In fact, I don't think Dane realizes how lucky he has it. After all, there's nothing better than a girl who does binary conversions in her spare time. For fun, even! Reeeow!

      I have something to admit. I have been living a lie. For the past several days, I've been basking in glory that wasn't rightfully mine. The world was shouting my name, naked women threw themselves upon me, and offers of fabulous wealth poured in daily. But then there was a flash of lightning. Thunder crashed, and a dark figure entered the scene. His flowing cape fluttered in the wind, and his eyes burned with the fire of a thousand suns. It was the dramatic young visionary known only as Spencer, coming to cast his judgement upon me. He thrust his finger at me and bellowed, "O False Messiah! You traitor to all of man! Deceiver! I cannot abide your lies any longer! For you have perverted the works of great men and claimed the results as  urlLink your own!  The world shall soon know of your greivous sins." With that, he wrapped his cape around him and vanished into thin air. I was left, surrounded by a heavy fog of shame. My faithful readers, can you ever forgive me? I'm sorry if it raised your opinion of this shallow, hollow person. Why God? Why do you allow this patchwork piecemeal man to keep drawing breath? When he has nary an original thought in his styrofoam peanut-filled head? Oh Dane! I have forever tainted this site! [intese bawling]
