      Sometimes people annoy me.  I wonder who came up with tea. Like some random person decides to stick leaves in some water and make the water nice and hot. And then after doing that, how about I just drink it. I love tea. But seriously who thinks of these things? Its just like the concept of milk. Either some pervert saw a cow and molested it, drinking whatever shot out, and found taht it was good; or someone clever saw that the baby cows drank the milk, and lived off of it, and thusly thought of using the milk to sustain themselves. I sincerely hope it was the latter.  I also ponder who thought homework was a clever idea. How about we make the kids come to school and do the work then send them home and make them do more of it. I understand the concept of reinforcement but can't we just reinforce it in class. And "practice makes perfect" but funny enough, no one is ever perfect at anything. And if they are near to perfect it means that they like doing it, which means that they weren't forced to learn whatever the heck it is they are near perfect at. Or let me say this, I've never met someone that good at something who was forced to do that thing.  But then again you can be 'a natural' at something. Which of course means you're really good at something and you never had to work to be really good at it. Like Finny from that book "A Seperate Peace". He was just really good at everything involving sports. He never had to work for it. I guess that was really the concept of the whole book. Finny thought that main character person didn't have to work for his good grades and ultimately (aha. recalled his name) Gene ended up hating Finny because he didn't realize that. See, Finny was just a natural at sports, so he figured that Gene was just a natural at his studies. So Finny didn't think Gene needed time to study, but Gene saw it as Finny trying to kill his grades. In the end its really what did Finny in.  Have you ever had two friends fighting, and each of them starts telling you about the fight? Person A says how annoying person B is. And person B is going on about how irritating person A is. And somehow you get caught in the middle of your two friends argument. But you can't take sides because you're hearing both sides of the story, and both of them are your really good friends, and you don't want to make either of them angry with you. Its really a very bad situation to be in. Oh see and then horrid things happen, people just shouldn't argue...the horror..poor dear..  I have this friend, and he feels really bad about himself, and I never knew. I understand now why he gets mad so easily when I poke fun at him...I feel very badly. I can't beleive I didn't notice and didn't care. How could I be so insensitive? Stupid..stupid me. God, I feel so bad....

       Have you ever been asked by someone "What am I on a scale of one to ten?" And if so have you ever said to someone that they were a perfect ten, and said it truthfully? I haven't. But I have seen a perfect ten. Actually I met a perfect ten, yes a real person so beautiful in every way that they could not be considered anything less than a ten. I could have reached out and touched this person if I had wanted to. Can't stop thinking about him, not sure what it is...but he was a dream come true. (I lie, the people in my dreams couldn't even compare)

       Finally! I am able to be on the computer for more than five minutes. Darn school and its evil tendencies. As well as those teachers, always giving me homework..what is up with that? And the worst part is I've only been in school for two days. O.O       How is it possible? I wonder the same thing myself. It seems as though I have been in school forever, as though I never left. Which is good in some ways, you know like I'm comfortable with being there, and I'm okay with the strange people touching me in the hallway. *shifty eyes*      Which reminds me; I walked by this guy in the hall the other day, and I could feel the heat coming off him. Is that strange to you? Cause it was kinda weird to me. But recently I've been very sensitive to the amount of heat people are putting off. When I stand near people its like I can feel their radiation. O.o Scary, I know. But also kinda nifty. (In a creepy, fetish kinda way..hehe)      Oh well.       There are very few people in this world that can understand my incoherent babble. (At least I only know of a few) See Ashley, she gets it, we have one of those creepy connections. You know the kind when you know what the other is gonna say before they say it, or you pick up their feelings without even being near them. Stuff like that. Anywhosit, I wonder what that comes from. Is it just random people that this happens with? Or is it some connection that develops after knowing a person for so long?   I really don't think its that latter of the two because I have known plenty of people longer than I have known Ashley, and I never have, nor do I have now, any connection like that. ...*ponders*       See now you're thinking that I'm insane, that I don't know what I'm talking about, that no one  really  has connections like that. But I do, and that just proves that you don't truly comprehend my incoherent babble. Good for you, you follow the flock. Its safer to do that anyway, you know if you drift..or wander off, you could get devoured by lions or wolves.       Theres a happy thought for you. *sarcasm* Either way you look at it, unless you do understand my rambles, what I just said was an insult to you. Following the flock is by no means a good thing. You're a sheep, you're caught up in life, following the footsteps of someone else, and thinking you're getting ahead, but really you're just the same as everyone else, no different to the eyes of an outsider. And if you arn't following, it means that you're rebelling. That you have no place, and you are probably an outcast, you've done something horrid, or you just have a horrid attitude. I don't really like people with bad attitudes. Because even though it may seem like I am a rather depressing person, I'm not.       In truth, I am one very happy person. I have nothing to be sad about, and nothing to regret. I can move either way on the ladder, up or down. And I'm not afraid to do either. I'm constantly laughing and I hardly ever cry, I have no reason too. No need to express sadness, pain or anger. I hardly ever get truly angry..though the other day I did. The only time I ever feel like crying is when I have physically hurt myself or I'm feeling  very  lonely. But that only happens about once a year, when I have a pity party.       But I have discovered that pity parties get you no where. In the end you come back to where you started and nothing has changed except possibly how you look at it. And in my experience more bad comes from pity parties than good. Because when I ask for pity, I never feel as though the person handing it to me is doing it right. I feel like they're really not sorry at all for me, and think I'm just feeling sorry for myself. Which is true, but considering how often I dish it out to them they could do it just that once for me.      How did I get on the subject of pity and concern again? I thought I was done with that, apparently not, I am clearly subconciously obsessed with it. Ah, can't really do anything about my subconcious now can I? Nope.      So I'm off to bed, and you should all go to sleep too. I don't care what time it is, everyone can always use a good sleep.

       I have a horrid headache. Its like the one I had last year, at the beginning of the school year. It was a horrid headache that lasted for about three and a half months. The doctor said that it was a stress headache. That I was just stressed and nervous about school. So he gave me this really strong medicine that made them go away. After I got used to school the headaches just stopped all together.       But now school starts in two days, and I'm not scared, or nervous, or stressed. And yet, the headaches are back. I really don't want to be in that kind of pain again, its not exactly pleasant and it makes it hard to focus on school work. Not that I couldn't focus on school with them, it was just harder and it Huuuuurts. *whines*      Kay I'm done now. Go and be happy you don't have headaches.

       *snifflement* Summer is almost gone..gone, gone, gone. Its so sad. Yes, it is too sad. Because? Because you ask? School. Yes, school. Evil, feindish school. School that takes up all my time and forces me to sit in the little rooms with all the idiots who do nothing and think I'm strange. School that gives me homework and prevents me from being online. o.o So evil. And yet it appears so innocent. Pretending to be useful and saying that if I don't attend I'll never get a job and then I'll die.       Die. Such a small word, means a lot though huh? If you think about it. To die is inevitable, we're all gonna end up dead (another way of saying 'die'). So die impacts everyone, and it has multiple ways of doing so. You ought to be careful who you tell you die because they might think that finally the one person they could count on left them and then they would make themselves die. That would be horrid and no one should make themselves die.       If a loved on does die, its sad. Because you can't see them again, you can't talk to them, you ca't touch them, you can only miss them. And that is no fun, especially if at the end of all the missing is only your death. So you see die is a very bad word. I don't particularly like it at the moment.      Some words I just don't like, if its because of the meaning it makes sense right? But just because I don't like it for some weird reason people freak out. Like names. Some names just shouldn't be used. "Chad" Who names their kid that!? I hate that name...not that I hate people with that name, I just don't like the name. Or "Aristotle" what the heck kind of name is that? Say your kid is in trouble and you have to yell their name...would you rather say a nice name like "Benjamin so-in-so you get over here right now!" or would you like to yell "Aristotle so-in-so you get over here right this instant!" That's what I thought, I knew you would see it my way. Who in their right mind would name there kid Aristotle or Chad, or Bobert, or some other weird/annoying name. *rambles on*      Hem...so now I'm done rambling about that hehe. Not that you could have stopped me..in fact I think that if I had typed out more thought on that subject you would have continued to read it. Yes, because you would be curious as to what I had to say, and also you would have wondered what I would start on next. And if I had changed the subject and started writing about something other than the names. Yes, yes, thats exactly what you would have done. Or you would have stopped a long time ago when I was going on about names in the first place. Silly you.      Its funny how dry erase boards are so amusing. Did you ever notice that they are? I did. You have the pretty colors you write something then erase it like super easy and then write something else and so on. Its so easy to destroy what you did and so easy to start again. I think it shows exactly what everyone wants everything so be: easy. So people like to use them, and are amused by them. Or I could be completely off my rocker..and the only one who thinks that; actually that would be more fun than my theory being true. Yes, I'd rather be off my rocker for certain than be accused of being off my rocker constantly untruthfully.      Yes, many people have told me I've fallen out of my rocker and accused me of rolling around on the floor of insanity. Which I think is fantastic, except they have nothing to back up their accusations. Sure I'm strange but a plethora of people are strange, so that doesn't set me apart. And in truth I could accuse them of being strange and say that I was the normal one. And if I'm normal, then I wonder what happened to all of you? Or I wonder if you just haven't gotten really good at hiding that you're 'normal' too. ;)

       I blog in pink today. Aha. I hope that the pink will make me feel happier since I didn't have the best day. For some reason I just woke up really mad. And it didn't help that I had to go to MasterDrive. (A drivers Education program) There are three phases and I am so happy I'm on phase three. But I still have four more drives with the intructors. Today I had to do backing and parking. For two hours. To start off that can't be so much fun, and it wasn't. At all. It was so hot in the backseat for the hour I was back there. Then after I was done my mother was fifteen minutes late picking me up; that is a long time to wait outside of the little outlet building in the hot sun.       The rest of the day wasn't so bad I guess, but I was sad because my friend's computer wouldn't let him play Age of Mythology. So we couldn't play eachother online. I'd been looking forward to it so I was rather depressed when it wouldn't work. The last two times we tryed to play someone couldn't make it because some last minute thing came up...annoying. But I was still not very upset..though now thinking about it I guess I kinda was cause I got really mad later on and that doesn't usually happen.      We went out to dinner. To 'celebrate' going back to school. It was a nice dinner and I had fun. Besides the food was really good. hehe. I only got mad after we got home. My mother is obsessed with treating acne...and no I don't have acne. So she bought this new stuff, I told her I wasn't going to use it because I didn't want to. But eventually being the good little child I am I used the frickin' face wash. A few minutes later my sister tells my mother I didn't use the toner and face lotion.       Before I continue I should explain that I hate how face lotion feels. It is disgusting and slimey and just all around icky. So I don't use it, and my face isn't dry.       So my sister comes back with a message from my mother saying that I must use the toner and the lotion for it to work and I didn't give a darn what it said. I wasn't going to use the toner or the face lotion so she could go shove it up her. Not that I said that...just thats what I was thinking. So she sends my dad in to tell me to use it and hes all in the hushed tones...being all its not my fault don't yell at me..and I wanted to rip his frickin' head off! So he starts talking and that pissed me off more than using the junk. So I grabbed it from him and slammed the bathroom door to use it. He found that funny and that just made me more frickin' pissed then I already was.       I mean wouldn't you be pissed if you had slimey, smelly gunk all over your face? Even if you do normally moisterize. For all you prissy female dogs, shut the heck up!!! I'm not 'unclean' I don't have 'improper hygeine'. I CLEANSE! I WASH! I PUT LOTION EVERYWHERE ELSE! I POLISH MY NAILS AND I REALLY DON'T CARE IF I HAVE ONE FRICKIN' ZIT!!!!!!!!!!!! So you can either all go do yourselves or you can have sympathy. Sympathy being the better choice of the two.      But then he had the nerve to ASK if I ACTUALLY used the junk. YES I FRICKIN' USED IT! WOULD I BE ALL RED AND FRICKIN' PISSED AT YOU RIGHT NOW IF I HADN'T!?!??!?!?!?!? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I FING WOULDN'T!!!!!!!!!!      I huffed and I cried and I yelled and I shunned my mother. But somehow I ended up promising my father I'd use the junk for two more days; so my mother 'hadn't wasted her money'. But really even if I never touched it, my sister would be using it so it wouldn't be a waste now would it? NO I REALLY DON"T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!       You know normally I'm all sweet and caring and I care a lot you know? I love people. I love to make everyone feel better about whatever is wrong, or I like to think that I actually manage to help. But anyway sometimes I just get really really mad, and I'm not even sure why. It wasn't that big of a deal to just use the shit. And now I have a headache and my stomach hurts...so I am paying the price. Darn it all. But anyway..I guess I'm done rambling on..mostly because my head hurts too much to think out what I'm saying anymore.      You all go off and die.

       Aha. Fear the purple font, for it makes me happy. o.O Can colors make me happy? Yes, because when I wear the color pink I'm "tickled" ahahaha. Fear my attempt at humor. Yes, it was an attempt at getting laughs, I laughed anyway..o.o;;       So moving on, I'm currently talking to Nick and Ashes and Michael. It makes me happy to talk to my friends hehe. I guess that would make sense...otherwise why would I bother talking to them right? heh...      Hehe, Nick ish so cute. I just wanna coddle him sometimes. He's all ador-ed about everything he says. He could insult me and I'd think he was so cute about it...funny how that works. We play minesweeper flags currently..and I lose miserably. And now I am defeated at Tic-tac-toe..I wonder how they came up with that name..Is it like one-two-three in some weird language? That would make sense..wouldn't it? I think it would. Hmm...maybe I'll ask someone else later..*ponders*      Michael is getting so annoying; I wish he'd be normal and stop being all gushy. Can't we just have a decent conversation? Please?! For cripes sake. AND WHO IS CRIPE?! Good lord. *rambles on to self*      Soo...now that I'm off that subject. *gasp* I haven't said anything to Ashes for like ten minutes! Unheard of. Oooh she made someone feel her wrath. Personally I fear her wrath, she is rather scary when she's irritated or angry. But otherwise she's the most amusing person I know..and she understands why I randomly laugh. Isn't that great; I'm not insane by myself, I'll never get lonely. Even when everyone else starts ignoring me because I'm just too weird for them. HAHAHAHAHAHA! *cough*      I babble. I'm a babbler. I go on and on and on; about absolutely nothing. And I have fun doing it. I amuse myself more then anyone else could even attempt to. I'll see something and that will trigger a thought and then all of a sudden I'm on the floor laughing. I laugh so much it hurts, and I laugh a lot. Laughing is fun for me, its my source of happiness. If I didn't laugh at least once in the day I think it could be potentially harmful. I could die, or something not so dramatic.       O.o Yes, I'm morbid. Mwahahahahahahahahahaha. *cackles and coughs*

      Yes. The pen exploded on me. It has some nerve. Ahahahaha, like the pen has feelings..or does it? Can't really be sure can we. *eyes pen suspiciously* But anywhosit the pen exploded all over my hands..and now my keyboard is slightly green. Most horrid really. However I am certain I can get it off *cackles*...  I hate when pens explode, I'm lucky enough that they never do it at school, and I've never stained my clothes off of them..but they annoy me. My faithful pen that suddenly has had enough of writing for me decides to sacrifice itself. Maybe it is a noble way to die in the pen world...I think if I were a pen I would just wait until I ran out of ink, it would seem as though I had had a better life.  But I guess if the person had sweaty palms and got sweat all over me all the time; I too would explode to save myself from that horror. But I don't have sweaty hands so I can't imagine what the pen had against me. Unless I held it too hard..or pushed to hard..alas! I will never know.  It would be interesting to know how things feel. For instance my keyboard or Mr. Fanful. Who is my computer by the way. He's very faithful, always on and he usually does as I ask him. I rarely have trouble getting him to do things and he's never shut down completely on me. Mr. Fanful is rather loud but other than that I love him, and I've gotten used to the sound of his fan. But I often wonder if it takes a toll on him, considering I never shut him down or put him to sleep. I also wonder if my keyboard gets tired from be pounding on it practically constantly.  However the keyboard will get a considerable break once school starts in a few days. On wednesday the 18th to be exact. Then I will not be able to sit at the computer all day...for I will have to be in class, learning 'important' things that will get me through life. Yes, those days of writing with a pencil and taking notes, and tests, and labs and so on are back. Though I have to say this summer has been great; I did practically nothing and I loved every minute of it. In a way I'm kind of glad that I have to go back to school, it will give me something to do, and I'll see my friends again. Not that I have that many to see...but you get it...and if you don't its not like I care.  Today I found this new kind of Nickel..yes, a new nickel. On the back it said somthing about the louisianna purchase..and it looked shiny and new. I've never seen a nickel like that so it must be some new thing. Like the new twenties and such. I wonder what was wrong with the other money? Why change it. In case you didn't know, I hate change. Change is annoying, everything simple could stay the same you know. For instance curtains, why get new curtains?! The other ones are perfectly fine. And why rearrange the furniture..it was doing just as well where I am used to it being. I really hate when the furniture is moved because then I have a tendancy to run into it...I always know just when to move in my house to avoid hitting the couches and chairs and tables..and then someone comes along and moves them over an inch or switches the chairs with the couch, and then I come home and run into things because they're not where they should be.  There was nothing wrong with the money so why not leave it alone? Seriously...*shakes head* It's hopeless and I have no say in the matter..so I have to deal with it. I suppose I will live..because I'm not willing to die just because I don't like how the money looks. That would be kind of silly. Especially when you think about how many people die every day for important things.  And reading over that I notice "Wednesday" ...who thought of spelling the word like that..seriously..wendsday..thats how it sounds. Wednesday; if you said it like its spelled it would be saying it wrong..the horror..who comes up with these things and why do we need a name for every day of the week? couldn't it just be 'day'? Apparently not..Ack...yon evilness of the computer time restrictions..oh well I've wasted enough time today writing down meaningless thoughts...hehe but I do so amuse myself while I do it.

      Yes, I ponder more. It is because I have discovered that it is Friday the 13th. Though it is not in October. hehe. I'm not superstitious or however you spell it; but its fun to see how other people are. So now I'm just sitting here talking to Ashes and playing Minesweeper flags with Nick. Which happens to be great fun. Though he let me win..and I was disturbed. I don't like people letting me win, call me stupid, but its not fun unless the game is played fair.  Oh well, and now I really have nothing else to say, but there are a few mistakes in my last blog...two of them you should be able to figure out, if you can't you're completely stupid but the other I feel I should correct since it is bothering me. "...just as certain of his lover for..." It should be just as certain as his love for her. Not lover for...lol. Anywho more of your time wasted and I'm done.

      Yay! Feel my wrath, for I ponder. Of course now that I start to ponder, I have nothing to say..o.O isn't that just how it always is though? In case you didn't know, the answer is yes. No I am not putting words into your mouth, that really is the answer. So anywho...I have just had this thought come to me...clever how now I shall type it out...*ponderment*  Have you ever met someone and known right from the start you would hate them? And in turn with that, have you ever met someone and known right from the start that you would love them or be friends with them forever?  I haven't. But I guess that such a happening can not be uncommon. And I also guess that if you met such a person, knowing that you would feel that way forever would be a great burden. Some might tell you it would have to be an excellent bit of knowledge. They might fancy it to be a wonderful moment of revealing bliss. But how could this be? Let me pose another question. How would it feel to look upon someone and know you could do nothing but hate them when they are enthralled with you? And in the same turn how would it feel to look upon someone and know that you would always love them, even if they grew to hate you, or grew to love someone that was not yourself?  Hence I dread meeting someone and knowing my feelings from the start. Raw emotion, I've noticed, never has a pleasant result. Only in fairy tales does love happen in a beautiful way. A hansome prince that half comes upon and half stalks a fair lady, and a 'chance' meeting at the end of which she is certain of her love for him and he is just as certain of his lover for her. And then someone, for some dreadful personal reason, does not want the two to be together. And so the antagonist, 'villain' if you will, does something horrid to prevent the two from coming together. But somehow the Prince manages to overcome whatever has put itself between him and his goal, and thus 'wins' or steals fair ladies heart.  And though the two 'lovebirds' have met but twice they ride off into the sunset, intwined in a loving embrace. and that is perfectly lovely, but it never happens. To find out Prince charming we must 'test' a great many frogs. So we date and put ourselves through agony and more agony. But we continue with the agony knowing that in the end we will find something, nay, someone who will make up for all the horrible things we went through to find them.  Deep inside I know this must be true because if it wasn't why would I continue to live. There must be something at the end of all the torture and sorrow, that will make it all worthwhile. though at this point what thing could possibly make up for it, eludes me. Could it be that I do not have something waiting for me? No, there must be something there.  You see now a smile comes upon my brain and I know I have nothing to fret over because thus far my journey has not been bad at all. Especially if I look at others I know. In comparison, and even withoutmy life has not been bad, except in very minor ways and I really have no place commplaiing or wanting pity. But I guess that it is human nature to want pity for I do, and so does everyone I know. Just  a little caring and compassion to let me know I'm loved and remind me that things could be worse and I could have horrors in my life that I don't.  It seems that lately I give a great deal of sympathy and get none in return. For it also seems that those who ask for and receive sympathy yearn for it even more. And to get it they will manage to turn every situation into one that they receive sympathy. And the one time you really need sympathy it will seem that no one is there for you because they will turn the situation to themselves and soon you will be busy with compassion, again, having gotten none yourself.  Then I assume you will feel slightly rejected and then find yourself in want of more pity. Until soon you have a cycle, a rut, that you can't get out of and I asuume that leads to the final resort. That last call fot help; depression.  And now that I have taken up precious minutes of your life and mine with my pondering I leave you.
