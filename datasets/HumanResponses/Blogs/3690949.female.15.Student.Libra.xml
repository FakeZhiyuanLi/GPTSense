      Music on the crappy Radio Station from NYC:  James "Laid" Hilary Duff "Come Clean" Some Metalica crap and other total crap rock/rap bands... (I really miss L.A. radio stations!!)  Had a long talk with my new guardians.  it seems they are concerned; waiting for me to have some sort of meltdown.  i now picture them looking at the ceiling beneith my room, waiting for the slag to fall through.  but what do I tell them?  of course im not particularly happy at present.  who would be?  just burried mom, dad lost it in the process, and im living across the country trying to build a new life.  i'll get it, but give me some slack!  yes, they are wonderfully caring people (they are my god parents after all), but i don't know what they want to hear.  it's as though they want me to just loose it all of a sudden.  but i cant seem to communicate to them that I am just trying to move forward.....

      Music on the iPod:  Guster: "Amsterdam"  Franz Ferdinand:  "Cheating on You" Longwave: "Everywhere You Turn" Cowboy Junkies: "My Wild Child"  -no reasons today for why these particular songs nor what they've meant in the past....   I spent the morning and early afternoon sitting on a pier by the water, reading "prayer for owen meany".  I am nearly through with it, and i must say, not a bad book.  it was good to smell the salt water (even though it IS the LI sound).  chatted with a very kind old man who was out for a walk.  he sat near me to rest and struck up a conversation.  he was such a gentleman, and so sweet.  i bet his grandchildren love him.  now I am posting this blog in the library on a public computer, and trying to figure out how to get home.  this will be so much easier when i can finally drive in october.  though connecticut has some total crap law about not being allowed to drive past 9pm until 17 or so.     i think i'll go see "Mean Girls" this afternoon.

      Music on the iPod:  Pete Yorn: "On Your Side"     (the guitars..) Beck: "Lost Cause"     (just a great tune - i keep this one just for me) Casey Chambers: "The Captain"  (memories of beach parties) Enya: Random Enya songs that help chill me out  So i've got kind of a cool room.  they have put me at the far end of the "L" shaped monstronsity that is their home.  i've got a balcony which is by far the best part.  there is something about being ouside on a beautiful night when no one is around. there is a gentle breeze, and it is just cool enough to make me put on a sweatshirt over my tank top.  and i just sit there, listening to music, not listening; not really thinking (a welcomed change), just being, feeling the ebb and flow of the breeze, the whisper of the leaves, just being, and for the first time in a while, it feels okay to just be.  dare i say i nearly felt connected to something, in some way.  perhaps i've just become delusional and am out of emotion.  emotionally bankrupt, that is me.  well not bankrupt, drained, perhaps?  connecticut is an unusual place.  i think i need to travel somewhere for at least part of the summer.  how the hell am i going to meet people without school?  time for some enya and sleep.

      Sunday Evening:  Music on the iPod:  Guster: "Either Way"         (ex bf, sunsets in malibu) Ryan Adams: "Wonderwall"        (the time around my mom's death) Tori Amos: "Mother"          (yes, I know it's about a wedding, but it still reminds of my mom) Modest Mouse: "Dramamine"      (first MM song I heard a few years ago) Ani Difranco:  "Firedoor"  (just an upbeat ani song...love the line "i'm singing now because my tear ducts are too tired") Lorna Vallings:  "Taste"      (uberly sexy song) and other random stuff.      so i was able to cam with my two best friends from back home in cali, and i miss them so much!  jenna and christina spent their day on the beach, laying out and playing volleyball with the boys.    what did I do?  I walked around downtown greenwich.  there is a rather long street called greenwich avenue, or "the ave" as the locals seem to like to call it.  loaded with upscale shops and pretentous restaurants they call bistros (have they even been to paris?).  coming from outslide L.A., i've grown accustomed to trends and culture of these areas, but connecticut definately has a unique feel.  firstly, the town is much more homogenous than its L.A. counterparts.  secondly, fewer people seem to smile.  but that's okay, i found a cute cafe that had great salads and little sandwiches.  and, i met a guy.  i was eating my salad and reading "a prayer for owen meany" and sitting in the sun when a landrover pulled up and 5 guys got out and went into get sandwiches.  one of them remained behind.  i looked up and smiled and he smiled and came over.  he asked about the book and if i liked the food, and told me his name is carter.  i introduced myself and told him i was new in town.  it turns out that he knows tyler from school and the lacross team.  though tyler will be a senior in the fall and cater a junior.  after a few minutes of the typical chit-chat, he friends came out and called for him to get in the car.  it ended with a simple "hope to see you around".  at least he knows where and with whom i live.  perhaps if he's motivated, interested and confident, he'll ring me at my god parents' house.  then again, how many high school guys have I known who are anything but confident?    I also picked up a train schedule.  NYC is only about a 30 minute train ride away.  i'll certianly venture into the big apple from time to time.  Chris (god father) tells me that I don't have to bother with a summer job; that i should instead take the time to meet people and adjust to my new surroundings, and (he said this with great hesitation) possibly see someone to talk about my mother's death and my father's strange behavior.  that's all well and good, and though his heart is in the right place, and understanding the possibility that he might be right, i am really not in to mood to talk about it with a therapist.  at this point in my life, I need to move on - to turn over the perverbial "new leaf".  tyler is working for a local architect and issa is a camp counselor by day and hooker by night...j/k! she works at a video store a few nights a week too....yes, she's something of an over achiever.  i think i'll look for a job since i've got no idea how to meet new people (unless more cute guys just pull up!) without school.    hmmm, what type of job should I get?

      okay.  so i've been relocated, the circumstances of which i'll get to later.  no longer am i living in sunny cali. no.  insead, i have been shipped off to the north east to live with my god parents since i no longer have a mother and my father is too busy with his life.  well, that's not entirely fair.  i think he cracked up a bit after my mom died six months ago. c'est la vie. anyway, i am here in greenwich, ct and writing my first ever blog, and living with my rather normal god parents and their 3 children, issa (my age), charles (6) and tyler (18).  last night tyler took issa and me to a bonfire at the beach.  some beach.  okay, greenwhich is on the long island sound...it's hardly even part of the atlantic...hello? what happenend to my life in the pacific?  anyway, i met some of their friends and watched everyone smoke up and drink.  i had a beer, but didn't feel like drinking...it wouldn't have been too cool to turn it down since i've just met these people.  and they are the most uberly preppy people i've ever seen.  i suppose i should go buy some polo shirts and wear the collar up if i'm gonna attempt to fit in.  what is wrong with these people?  it's like they are trying to make thier lives into a ralph lauren advert.  some guy who I would have thought was cute if he hadn't opened his mouth sat down and started talking to me.  right after he introduced himself, he told me he wanted to be a bond trader.  i am 15, and i couldn't possible care less about the financial world.  he is 16 and he shouldn't care either.  ugh!  the east coast is going to take some getting used to.    after the bonfire, where we nearly got arrested and had to sprint from the police cause it's apparently illegal (silly laws), issa was tired so tyler dropped her off and he took me around town - which by 1am was empty.  but, we were in his jeep with the top down and it was soooo nice to cruise along the wooded streets and feel the breeze.  maybe connecticut will be okay.  at least I wont have to drive hours and hours to get to skiing - though i've been told that east coast skiing sucks.  maybe that should be the east caost sucks....  think positively kayla!!  anyway, my iSight came today, so i'll be able to cam with my friends back west...keep in touch with a place i can atleast understand.  oh, and apparently my god parents have enrolled me in both the public school and the all girls private school in town.  i have until august 1 to decide which i want to attend.  yeah, right.  some choice.  how the hell am i supposed to know which to attend.  have any of you gone to either one? any and all advice is appreciated.

      i've spent the last two weeks back in cali - and it was surreal.  i actually thought it would be an escape from connecticut - that i'd feel, if only for a few days, that my life was the way it was prior to all the changes.  how wrong i was.    my friends are still the best, and we had so much fun.  but i have certainly changed.  or is it my perception of things that has changed?  at this point, i don't really care, i just want to feel grounded.    perhaps the only moment in cali when i felt like my former, once confident self, was when i was in malibu.  last saturday night some friends were throwing a party, and i wasn't sure i wanted to attend.  so i went for a walk on the beach and watched the sun set, and for a brief moment, felt whole.    more about that party later...rough night...  my thinking to too scattered to write at the moment...too much to do.
