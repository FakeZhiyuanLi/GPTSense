       YaY I finally did something =)! So Brittany calls me after she got home from Cheerleading and asked me If I wanted to go to Dylan's house with Him and Danny so I did. Wow it was fun! Dylan and Danny cRaCk me up! We went outside in the rain after Dylan and Danny riped Brittany's shirt in half haha well she had two so she had something else on;-) so we were all like chasing each other and wrestling and hitting each other with the shirt haha sounds pretty gay but it was actually kind of fun. Well Dylan and Britt were no where in sight haha so Danny gets out this juicy thing and starts squirting me with it and stuff so I chased him and was gonnna tackle him but he's pretty fast so we both stopped cause we were tired and Danny goes look a bird so I looked being the stupid person I am and he was already running haha wow great time. Well Brittany had to be home at 11 so we left there and I walked to her house and my mom came and picked me up around 11:15ish and then I came home and watched a HALLOWEEN movie with my sister Jess which I've seen like 10 times but I was still SCARED lol Michael Meyers ewww I don't like him haha! He's very very very very scary!!!!Marr!!!! Now I am getting ready to go to bed and stuff. Tomorrow I have soccer from 6:00-8:00 so I don't know what I am going to do before that but I hope I do something. But I am going to go to bed now so I will talk to yall tomorrow morning or something GoOd NiGhT   I love Yall.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -FLETCHIE-
