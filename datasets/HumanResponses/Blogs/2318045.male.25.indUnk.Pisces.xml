      Ok so here's the way I see it...  I finally wanted to have a place of my own to post all of my random musings, fun anecdotes, and stupid adventures.  Along with other really cool stuff too.  I would like to thank a good friend for the inspiration of the blog's name, and wish her a wonderful time in North Carolina.  She will be missed.  Now on to the blogging!

      An all round good ole American hippy weekend had in Humboldt County, California started with a propeller powered EMB 120 (all of 11 rows) flight from San Francisco.  The hum of the props help to sleep, but off and on occasionally gazing out the window to look at the NorCal coast, fog, rolling hills, and Redwoods.  Arrival.  Notice that the airport looks more like a Quonset hut than a port of travel.  Deplaned on the tarmac and walked through one of those zoo-like turnstiles to my friend patiently waiting.  Off to the local “old man” watering hole to have a dark amber microbrew and a shot of tequila while waiting for things to materialize for the evening.  Fantastic spot – right off of the main drag where people dubbed Plazoids hang out and hackey-sack, “spange”, or stand wearing all black statuesque-like in opposition to some small issue going on in the world.  The juxtaposition of “spangers” and loggers/NASCAR Fans/wet dish rags was fascinating (oh final count of white dreads was 35, sorry for those of you who went with the under at 22).  Next, off to get out of the business attire – completely out of place in Arcata (“Loafers man, what do you do?  Feed the Bush agenda, man?”).  Funny to walk into the place where you are going to be staying greeted by a long haired intellectual playing the fiddle.  Barbeque!  More dark microbrew action along with grilled Albacore wrapped in bacon.  All the while, coals burning, Frisbee golf on a make-shift course, “Suzy Sticks” (like horseshoes but with the bee man), jokes, laughter, green smoke, and bonfire readying.  Ending Friday sipping Jameson’s sitting around very hot coals talking about nothing much.  Saturday, more of the same.  Coffee and a drive out to Trinidad (rocky coastal fishing village) for breakfast/lunch.  Back in time for some wild wiffleball games and another barbeque.  Music blaring, wifflers arguing over strikes, someone extolling the virtues of Wing Time the Davis based heavenly wing sauce, pineapple and dogs grilling along with many other treats, yadda yadda…  A good time had by all.  Too good a time to end so everyone piles into the “grease truck” for some more fun at the local brewery.  Riding open air style in the back yelling as we haul down the 101.  (the “grease truck” is used to transport grease fuel called bio-diesel – check it out:   urlLink Humboldt CCAT ).  Sunday the Fourth of July Fair and Festival in the Plaza.  Funnel cakes, more dark microbrews, vegan and vegetarian foods, noodle dancing to jam bands, etc.  All of this and add a local Humboldt Crabs baseball game complete with sunflower seed spitting contests, more dark microbrews, veggie dogs, and fireworks made this year’s July 4th quite memorable.  And after the game biking, drunk, back in the dark to watch the Family Guy, laugh a lot, do knife hits (cough and puke), laugh more, and then pass out.  Monday wake up grab some more coffee load up the Jeep and off to the Eel River to canoe around and enjoy the non-foggy day.  Gliding along in a strawberry red canoe while getting paid for it was awesome.  Not getting paid for it would still be sweet.  And then off – back to the rat race in the afternoon and a longing sigh before walking into that Quonset hut airport.  Those few hours on the Eel put a capstone on one great weekend.  Thanks to all of the super nice friendly people I met and thanks USA for celebrating Independence Day.
