      I was just wondering if anybody would really be up for a seriously informal potluck type mixer thing some evening in July or August? It's possible that we have found a house to move into and it has a great backyard, so if all goes as we hope it does, then I'd be glad to host it. But if anybody else has a killer pad they're dying to show off, I'd be totally willing to bow out. You know, mostly an excuse to eat too much cheese dip and other goodies from the farmer's market and drink box wine and get to know eachother. I know, I know, you all already know eachother, but *I* don't. And I was kidding about the box wine.

      Spelling - by Margaret Atwood  My daughter plays on the floor with plastic letters, red, blue & hard yellow, learning how to spell, spelling, how to make spells.                   *  I wonder how many women denied themselves daughters, closed themselves in rooms, drew the curtains so they could mainline words.                   *  A child is not a poem, a poem is not a child. There is no either / or. However.                   *  I return to the story of the woman caught in the war & in labour, her thighs tied together by the enemy so she could not give birth.  Ancestress: the burning witch, her mouth covered by leather to strangle words.  A word after a word after a word is power.                   *  At the point where language falls away from the hot bones, at the point where the rock breaks open and darkness flows out of it like blood, at the melting point of granite when the bones know they are hollow & the word splits & doubles & speaks the truth & the body itself becomes a mouth.  This is a metaphor.                   *  How do you learn to spell? Blood, sky & the sun, your own name first, your first naming, your first name, your first word.

      Just a couple of things. I just found out we have to move in a (very) few weeks, so if anyone knows of a super good deal or has somewhere to recommend, I'm all ears. Email me. Also, if anyone wants to help tote or pack boxes. ha ha. But I DID think it would be nice to have a get together for the writing group and all our significant others and stuff so that everyone would have at least a passing idea of who we were all talking about during this six month experiment. Plus, I don't get out nearly enough with people my own age, so I'd like to have an excuse for a get together. if anyone else is interested, let me know and we'll plan something. I like to plan.

      This "fun" writing is amazing to me...for the first time since high school, I'm writing for ME. Of course, I'll share with you all. I'm not that selfish.

      very happy for the group blog. hubby says, "another blog?!" but he needn't worry. i'll always leave the computer to watch the daily show with him and the kitties. he can see me then.  unhappy because blogger will not accept any of my many names, even the real ones. hence, the rbkh. my name comes from hebrew so i suppose the nixing of vowels isn't totally unprecedented.  look foward to working with ya'll.

      Awesome idea for us to be able to communicate blogger-style, Mary! How I do adore posting and commenting...almost as much as I love carbs! Don't have any ideas yet for alternative names for the group, though am incredibly pleased to have been invited in. See y'all...you know...everyday of my life for the next five weeks. :)

      Thanks for taking the lead Mary... How exciting to have a new literary home for all of us.  I haven't yet come up with a name worthy of our group, but I'll keep chewing on it.  My recent trip to New York did however inspire me for the August assignment!  Now it's just finding the time to sit down and work on the idea that will be challenging.  Has anyone else come up with an idea, or has this last semester sucked out your creativity?  Oh, I saw today at the Java Monkey that they have open-mic nights there.  Anybody attend those events? Hugs,  -Amanda

      This is OUR blog for our new writing group, for which we have just started and have no name yet.  Just for now it is "Word After Word" but only for the sake of marking a space in the blog world.  It is up to change.  So, what should we call this community of writers and non-writers? poets and dramatists?  We did brainstorm a few ideas in our last (and first) meeting.  What other good names have you uncovered under stones lately?  Please reply.

      Do you think we have everyone on the blog?  For example, I haven't heard from Dr. Cozzens.  I wonder if she even knows about it.  Amanda

      I just wanted to check and make sure that nobody besides the punctual Mary and Doug had gotten their pieces in. Being the only one not on Agnes Scott Mail, I'm paranoid. Also, I promise I will get you my piece Very Soon. Just not right now. I'm working on it. I'm not just sitting here with a blank document and a whiff of an idea. Really.    Oh, about the party. How is July 31st for everybody? Anybody? I have a cute house and a cute backyard. I can shoot for being unpacked by then. I live in Decatur, off of College Ave. down towards Avondale. if anyone else wants to volunteer, it's cool with me. What kind of party should this be? Should we have a theme? Should it be meal food, or just snacks? Who brings what?   And one more thing. If anybody need boxes for a move, I have a bunch of very clean sturdy boxes that need a new home. Pick them up and they are yours.

      Hey, Just wanted to add a cute picture of Mary and me that was taken on her birthday! I would post other pictures if I was given permission by those in them.  But I'm sure Mary won't care.

             Well, it's almost over.  Regardless of the stress from last semester, none of us will forget Byron's hand movements during his presentations or Amy's creative hairdos and outfits or my standing, laying on the chair/desk/floor/whatever is available and all the other behaviors that set us apart from the person beside us.  But, now is the chance for those of us who are really writers to come together in a new and refreshing way.  Finally we will have a safe space to express our ideas, to question, to wonder, no matter how "out there" these thoughts may be.  And, we'll have the opportunity to publish together, attend spoken word events, meet authors, poets, musicians, etc.    I was reading "Life As An Adverb" yesterday, and Lee was talking about feeling nervous about going back to the real world, the working world.  I, too, already feel sad about not having school, not being a student who can hide behind that name and make mistakes because of that name: student.  But, we'll be that for each other and not the Survivor Island reality show type of student that many of us felt we were this last semester.  You won't be stranded out there in the intellectual wilderness on your own.    I just want to encourage everyone to really stay dedicated to the group, to become empowered by each other. It will be what we put in to it, and we will grow in every way if each person brings his or her whole self to the table. I know many of us are winding down from school, but I'm trying to look at my first piece as a way to purge.  It's therapeutic!   See you August 2 @6pm at Ashtons.  Oh, and I'd still like some feedback on getting together for a cookout or something at someone's house.  Volunteers?  Didn't Jenny say she could host?  When I get settled into our new house (hopefully by Christmas if not way before) I want to have everyone over! Maybe we can have our Christmas or Winter Holidays party at my house!! Take care,  -Amanda

      In addition to Amanda's post, I just wanted to add that the pieces are due soon - by this upcoming Monday or Tuesday (19th/20th) - so that each of us has time to write our comments and responses on them; members of group #2 will bring their pieces on the night of our first meeting.  Since we are the very first group to go, I suggest sending your pieces via email/email attachment.  Refer to Doug's list from earlier, and make sure to add Tony's and Lisa Anne's emails to the list.  I hope everyone is doing well.

      Hey all! Just wanted to remind group #1, which is Jenny, Doug, Laura, Mary, Amy and Lisa Anne that we will be looking for your first writing piece to arrive for critique in another week or so.  Good luck to everyone during the last week of class/finals for our MAT group. I know that you are relieved that it's almost over.   Also, Ashtons has started a Saturday night open-mic poetry event.  I attended last night and was quite impressed.  The place was packed, and many of the poets were extremely rhythmic.  I saw one published poet, Chris Slaughter, whom I had known in NYC and have heard his work many times... so some experienced people were in the house (as well as some new voices).  I think it would be great for us to go one Saturday night as a group.  I think we could really add a new flavor into the mix.  I purchased a CD from one poet called Freedom Speaks, and she really seemed to have mastered the word play of spoken word. It's a different way to look at writing, and I really think the audience would appreciate our diversity.  If any of you want to attend on the 17th or 24th let me know. It starts at 10:30pm but I only stayed about an hour, although I'm sure the mic was open for quite awhile longer.  One other idea.  I am hoping that we can have a public reading sometime in November.. possibly November 15 since we have extra weeks in that month.  Please be thinking of places to have this and the way you might want to organize the event... or if you even want to do this at all.  Ashtons might be an idea or somewhere different just for a change.  We could serve appetizer at someone's house.. whatever.  I just thought that it would be cool to invite those we care about to come and hear our work.  If anybody wants to head up the endeavor, let me know.  Hope the words are flowing and everyone is doing well!  Until next time... Amanda

      I just wanted to say hey to everyone in our writing group.  I know many of you know each other for about a year or so now...isn't that right?  Well, I only know a few of you; I see familiar faces on campus sometimes but we still don't know each other.  This is an excellent way of getting to know all of you; what a good idea!  I'm looking forward to it! Oh where oh where is this party...?  :)  ~Laura

      How is Saturday July 31st for the date of the mixer? Is it compatible with school? Will Doug be recovered from his trip? Night or afternoon? I started on my story today. Very exciting.

      Hey, I think we should try to get Khwaja to join our group.  He is a writer and would add so much to our discussions.  I know the group won't run smoothly with too many people, but I think he could really bring in a new perspective and make us stretch.    P.S. Are the creative juices flowing for your piece for August? Have a great 4th of July!  -Amanda

      Hi Everyone,  (do I have everyone on my e-list above?)          First of all, I still (okay, I'm a complete idiot) can't figure out how to post on the group's blog. Although I have a "profile," the name of our blog doesn't come up so I can't get into it in posting mode. I can, of course, read the blog. If anyone can give me a hint as to how to do this correctly, I'd be grateful.          Second and much more important, we had a very good meeting last night, I thought. I hope all the contributors got something useful from the discussion of their works.           At the end, we talked about how it went and what we'd like to do to make it even better in the future.  Here are the suggestions that came from that discussion.           --Each time we meet, anyone who CAN'T attend should let others know so that we don't wait for someone who is not coming. Email, blog post, telephone--just let the group or someone who is coming know that you can't make it.          --We will start on time, so if the meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., that's when the writing exercise person will get us going. If you want to socialize before the meeting, come early!  If we need to change the meeting time to accommodate people who have to come from across town or whatever, we can do that.           --At least for next time, the group that is presenting their works should get them to the rest of us by email NO LATER THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE MEETING. If we want to go back to the other method, that is, you distribute your work at the meeting before the meeting where you present, we can do that. But only Tony brought her work to distribute last night, so we decided to distribute works by email for next time.          --Everyone should read everything two or three times before the discussion. That's why we need to get the works distributed early.           --Also, let's give our marked copies to the author after the discussion--that way she or he can contemplate suggestions, queries, etc. that aren't necessarily covered in the discussion.           --If you come to the meeting, please make every effort to stay the whole time. That's the level of commitment that will make the group work. We will do everything possible to stay on t ack, so that we begin and end on time.  Again, we can change the time to accommodate people if need be.          --These suggestions come from me. Could everyone put their name, the date of the discussion, and page numbers on their works? This will enable all of us to be better organized.           --Another suggestion from me--we can talk about this one. Perhaps the person assigned to lead us in a writing exercise each time could also be the "leader" for that night--keeping us on track with the time, serving as a contact person for last minute drop-outs, etc.  I fell naturally into the leader's role last night, and while I could continue to do that, I think it would feel more like a writing GROUP if we shared that responsibility.  Let's discuss this, and indeed, we can discuss all of these comments.            --Future meetings.  Our next meeting will be Monday, August 23, 6-8 p.m. unless we decided differently over email. For September, we pencilled in  the 13th and the 27th (so as to avoid meeting on Labor Day weekend).   Following that schedule, the October meetings would be on  the 11th nd the 25th, which works well with my travel schedule. Again, all of this can be discussed and changed, but we wanted to at least begin to look ahead.           Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make last night's meeting a sucess.  Special thanks to our four illustrious contributors/guinea pigs who held up beautifully under the group's scrutiny.          I enjoyed talking about writing with writers--I hope others did, too!          Christine

      because she knows just how much I love maps. She understands, truly understands, how much knowing all there is to know in and about the world means to me. She understands how frantically I want to walk on each continent, the languages I want to speak, the lives I want to live. So she gave me the world.  I was in full tears tonight as I told her how unmendable my heart will be when some man marries her away from me. When they have beautiful babies and plant trees and flowers in the yard of a cozy home--how I'll plot to burn it down, just so I can call her at three in the morning and talk to her til six, and not worry that someone is stroking her thigh, fitting himself into the crease of her buttocks and whispering into her ear that she hang up and let him love her back to sweet dreams.  Any of these things could, will, I'm certain, happen to either of us. Just because I am so resistant to the idea of there being a constant man in my life, I'll probably be the one who succumbs (gives in, loses myself, becomes a typical woman) first. And she will ache for the best friend she's ever known. Or I will ache for the best friend I've ever known. No matter. Her or me, one of us will mourn the loss of the other first.  Soon. Because that's what happens when women of a certain age graduate from college and go forth into the world.  They mate.   They procreate.  They become trapped.  They are never as wild and free and brazen and...  loud...  ever, ever again.  My God, I don't want to lose her...and yet...I know the way of things.

      I have an interview tomorrow, for a job I don't want, but desperately should really try for. So,in preparation, I had my hair spiral-curled. So it would look nice. So I'd look like a professional person instead of what I actually am...a college bum, someone who does well if she brushes her teeth that day and wipes her ass properly. Just kidding about that last bit. I always wipe my ass, but I do admit to sitting there taking a long sigh sometimes while I muster up the energy. Anyway, the hair. Oh my God. It's huge. I used to love this hair style, but that was back when my hair was in a cute little bob, now it's clear down to my shoulders and, therefore, much too long for all these curls. It's huge! There are thousands, I believe, quite literally thousands of curls framing my cherubic little face. I hope this has never happened to any of you. This gorgeous, yet humongous hair is going to ruin my life. Because it will force me to not be hired on for the job, I really will run out of money and become homeless. But luckily, these granite curls will still be in tact and I could probably sell my body on the street to desperate men for a couple bucks. At least I won't starve.  In future, I promise, Lord Krishna, to be more thoughtful about what I tell those infinitely powerful people (hairstylists) to do as they coif me. I swear I will seriously consider the fact that I just may be getting too old for these Shirley Temple locks.   For now, I'm done in. Still...I think I would quite like it if it weren't for the job. After 2:30 pm tomorrow, I'll be a bit happier about it, I think. I'll be sure to report.

      I tell you what, I can put together a clever sentence. Articulating my love for you, so that your heart will swell for knowing me, is a skill I perfected long ago. I can make you love me like you hadn't known you had the  capacity  for loving, just by telling  you  how I love you. And it isn't fair, because no one has ever made me feel that way. Not really. I've pretended, but, no, not really.  Once there was a man, with whom I believed I was in love, but I was wrong. He came closest. He thought himself a writer, so he tried very hard to move me. And he did, until I thought a bit about what he had written, and the bitterness of cliché, the aftertaste of previous use was sickening enough to make me wretch his sentiments into his lap. He was beautiful, I thought for so long. And his words were "deep"...before saying "deep" was sacrilege...and I wanted to fold myself into him and be cocooned by the words he had written about me. All these beautiful things, about me, that he had seen--had looked deep down and seen when no one else had--almost fooled me into thinking I was what he needed and he was what I needed. When, actually, the universe never meant for the two of us to be together at all. If it did, I would be speaking to him now. When I thought, "My love..." his face would materilize in my mind. It doesn't.  He does not know why and I can't tell him. How do you say, without breaking a heart you don't want to break, "I see through you. Your body never makes good the promises your lips and pen entice me with. You could never be enough for me."  So, quietly, I left him. No explanation. No regret. Never to seriously consider that baggage again. I walked away forever.  Then there is the woman I know now, who backed me into a corner and forced me to declare my devotion to her. All she wants is friendship. All she wants is best friendship. All she wants is all of my time. All she wants is all of my attention. I have never been able to really be what another woman wanted in a companion. There is no urgency, no pull, no fire in my belly when I think of women, as there is when I think of men. At best, there is a fleeting, syrupy sweetness that always hovers above the thin line separarting sincerity from the most humiliating patronization. With her, there are moments when I think we could be in one another's lives forever. But they never last. She always speaks or breathes in such a way as to let me know my days with her are numbered. She senses this already. Told me so a few days ago, which compounds the ickiness the sight of her brings on.  She said to me that she could tell I was searching for reasons to never talk to her again. Which is a pretty amazing insight for many reasons. First, because it happens to be true. Second, because she isn't that bright, and I would never expect for her to be able to coherently express that kind of idea. That is, coherently express anything without saying, "You know what I mean?" or "I mean...you know?" or "Like...like...like..." You know what I mean. I wish I could keep her around, but I know she'll drive me crazy. She's so simple. So happy. So...nice. And I am none of those things. But, sometimes, she makes me feel like I am nice and brilliant and lovable. And for that reason I wish I could keep her. If it weren't for her being herself, I think I would with no reservations. Because I have loved her. But once I did, she wanted to be the only one I loved.  That is it, I think. That I can't be chained to just one person, one anything. If I could be her "best friend"--her truest friend is what I would like to be--and not feel I had to constantly reassure her that I am, then things would be better. I will miss her when I go, if I go.  Maybe this is just a mood. Maybe I need her, and don't want to admit it for fear that she'll leave me when she figures it out. I can't say. I'll just have to see how things fall in or out of place.  I can't shake feeling that she isn't enough, though. And I can't say what enough is, but I don't think I've found anyone who can tell me how they love me so that I feel like they feel when I tell them how I love them. I love so hard, so thoroughly, so all of my everything.   "I believe that my life's gonna see the love I give returned to me..."

      Well, for starters, there's a paper to be written. But I'm not in the mood. I have the reference materials. I have my entire CD collection to fuel whatever juices one needs when they write papers. It isn't even a serious assignment. The last paper I turned in--last week, mind you--was 45 pages. 45 blasted pages! Of my life...my thoughts...my analyses...my proof...my conjecture...my graphics...my charts...my SOUL. And now I'm tired.  So, I absolutely CANNOT...  be bothered...  to write this 5 page paper--at this moment. My mind is ten other places.   With my love, off in a faraway land. Inside my wallet, wondering if there are quarters for a Coke from the machine. At the cinema, where I would like to go sequester myself. With my friend...is the damage I've done unmendable this time? In his office, down on my knees, worshipping him the only way I'm worthy. In front of the TV, held captive by the Syndication Monster. At the bookstore, where there is a magazine article I am dying to read, but won't until this paper is complete. Inside my wallet, wondering if there are pennies enough for a Cherry Coke from the machine. In Gambier (just for today, and then not again until August), my body pulsing for one last squeeze from Sheldon. Under the covers, where lots of different types of fantastic things could transpire.  But I am here.  In a lab. Not even at my own desk, in my apartment, utilizing my shiny new computer. Rather, in a lab. Like a rat. One who's told, "Go, go, go...produce, produce, produce...provoke, provoke, provoke..."  And she does, usually. But not this moment. Not quite yet...though, I will again...soon.  I'm tired. Really, as tired as I've ever been.  And afraid. Afraid of packing up my whole life and moving back into my parent's home. Afraid of no longer having privacy. Afraid that once I go back in, I'll never emerge. Afraid that someone I know will discover this space. This space I've chosen to air all my thoughts, my secrets, my desires. My blog.  What a strange word. At first, a little off-putting...sounds so much like something people I would never want to talk to spend their entire lives creating. But, now, so will I...because...I need to take a deep breath. So, I've given birth to you. Go forth, my darling. Bring me new acquaintances, laughs, total candor--baptise me into the world of strangers being let into my head, me into theirs.  For ever and ever...Amen.

      Tonight would be the perfect night to curl up with someone male and intelligent and substantial and warm to...sleep. I've been thinking about this pretty relentlessly these days. Well, because someone said to me, "You know, you should really try spending an entire night with a man. You'd like it, it's nice." So, of course, not to deviate from the response people the world over who know me would expect, I said, "Oh, come on. Don't make me listen to that shit right now. I'm really not in the mood." A little bitchy, I know, but I meant it to be.  First, because it really was a bad time for her to be gushing (especially to me) about her current fling because I was way too busy madly packing up my apartment, working inside an impossible timetable. Second, because I feel like some things are too intimate to share with everyone. Granted, this woman and I are close--relatives, actually--but I've never told her anything  really  dear about myself and any man I've ever...um...I don't know...anything-ed. Whatever it is I do with men.  See, that's the thing, and where, I believe, I prevent myself from getting some of the things I want. There really haven't been that many intimate things with men. There have been sordid things. There have been hilarious things. There have been exhausting things. There have been sweet things. All things  done  with, though. I only ever  do  things with men--and I say things because that's what I mean. Trust that if I meant I was indiscriminately fucking men all over the southeast, I'd say so--would chat up anyone who would listen about it, in fact. Kidding. Sort of. But, no. I say do things just because it includes everything--all the whatevers you could do with a man you were sexually attracted to. Like date, or kiss, or touch, or massage, or have sex with--everything. And that's all. Never, ever anything so intimate I felt like a piece of the life the gods meant for me to live had finally come to fruition. Only ever the superficial. Why? Well, why do you think? Let's list, shall we...  -Mortally afraid of anything deeper -Am allergic to discussions of matrimony -Become queasy during commitment-speak -Am quite a picky little girl -Love intelligence that doesn't always have to be validated -Get bored really quickly if he's...well, stupid -Get bored really quickly if he isn't an artist, of some kind -Can tell immediately if his interest is just physical...and it almost always is...and so my own, if I choose to date him, can never be more than that (turn about's fair play) -This one is awful, I know...still...generally, men are guilty until proven innocent--in my mind. I've seen them in action, I know what the worst sort are all about. I've seen soooooooo much atrocity--such cruelty--and can only speak as I have seen -Putting a shattered heart back together again is an impossible business. Takes forever. I never want to do that again. -I only ever REALLY want the ones I could never/should never have (my best/truest friend says this is consciously done) -It's easier to do it this way.  ...et cetera, et cetera...  And here is the kicker. I believe in love such as I have never seen before, so I don't think that it's possible. I don't think anyone ever really ends up with the person whom they crave  most , the one who makes their skin tingle, around whom they lose their breath, whose eyes say everything they ever wanted to hear, whose touch is absolutely perfect, no matter how or where they do it...mmmm. Picky, see? And I don't ever want to settle.  So, I've never, ever had a serious relationship. I'm not nearly ready...well, tonight I am. I'd murder,  tonight , to instantaneously be six months into something with someone whose kiss still makes my tummy squirm and my legs ease open...do you understand? Yeah, but, god, I don't think I'm built to do the work it takes to get to that place. I'd find some reason to sack him before I started to need him...and even if I did end up needing him, I'm stubborn enough to deny myself until I forget what it is he has that I want/need so desperately...but that's a whole other issue...some other time.  So, tonight would be perfect if I fell asleep, woke to the sound of my lover...mmmmmm...my lover...using his key to come in. He'd get a drink of water, take a piss (shaking off excess properly), get undressed, get into bed with me, wrap himself around me, kiss my neck just behind my ear...and love me. However that would manifest.  But that's just how I feel tonight. Tomorrow I will probably actively seek to verbally castrate three men...at least. Punish them for punishing me. Because I want them so badly, sometimes, though I despise some of their sex with venom such as...too tired to complete the simile.  All right. There's that. Such a complex history. Will probably never be reconciled. Off to bed, alone, then. Aside from the comfort I can provide for myself...which, my god, doesn't even begin to compare.

      I have, yet again, packed up my entire life and set it down again in an unfamiliar place. I have never liked any part of this entire business. At least it's done. It's so strange, though, that everything I have, everything I am, everything I've desired and could get--these things can all fit into a box. Well, many boxes. So many boxes. When I walk(ed) into my apartment, into my room, there never seemed to be as much as I see there is now that I have had to acknowledge every possession. Now, in this new place, all I ever wanted is here, surrounding me, taking up much more room than I am comfortable with--just sitting. Nothing, yet, is on display, that will serve to tell who I am, what I like, what I dislike, who I love. Well, almost nothing.  I have lots of delicate things, lots. Glassware, electronics--in fact I dropped my entire new computer on the ground yesterday but I was nowhere near as afraid as when I came upon my cousin and "step father" unpacking my Top Box--the one that I cared about the most, the one filled with the things that have made my life a life--to split it in two. Apparently, I'd packed too many of my books into one rather large box, which I knew would be very heavy for someone--certainly not me, weakling that I am--but I put them all in there together because they were always meant to go into boxes together, the way that I put them there. I was mortified that they dared undo what I had done. How could they know what covers can rub against one another? Which can be closer to the bottom, take on the pressure of the weight of the others? How could they ever know anything about the care it took to pack these my most prized possessions. I will grant that this was not my only box of books, there is no box large enough in which all of my books could be transported now. But I put together books that could go together.  Yes, even in boxes, there is an order (admittedly mostly based on how it makes me feel to put this book here, that book there) to the way my books are arranged.  They didn't know that, so I gasped, grabbed my heart, cried out, and fell into the nearest wall with the horrified shock of what they dared do without my consent, without my guidance, without my own two hands!  I was, of course, ignored. They continued their task, only caring that their backs and legs would be able to move these delicate darlings of mine to my new home. And, in the end, I realized that since I wasn't going to be carrying any of the boxes of books, no matter how many they decided I needed, I'd best let them to it in whatever way would get it done.   But I was left contemplating just how dearly I love my books, how they are the best things I have, how I've never regretted the purchase of any one of them. Because I don't have much--materially--because the things I want are not as readily available. As in...Africa. I want Africa. And I want India, Ireland, Italy, France, the whole world--name a place in it and I want to see it, know it, live there so I'll  know  it. And so far, my books are the closest I have come to getting everything I have ever wanted. They are the world right now. The actual gateways to places I have never been to. Every leaf new terrain traversed. Every literary period a new epoch investigated.   I don't go in much for naming favorites of anything--although I do believe that all I ever need to know about the world I have read in  Jane Eyre  and  Wide Sargasso Sea --but my box(es) of books trump everything. I could lose all my clothes in an uprooting so long as my books made it.   And they did make it, my Top Box(es), every one of them. Still quite large, if I do say so myself. The world is a big old place, and I want to see and understand as much of it as I can while I can.  In this new, strange room, filled with dancing shadows and dust, there is one thing on display--a box of books, thrown open, titles spilling out. I had to know if  Maru  was there, if  Cyrano de Bergerac   was there...they are. Now, I'll sleep well.

      No matter the hoops of fire I jump through or the deadly teeth of briar I belly-crawl underneath to evade him, Dave Eggers will not be cast aside.  Well, that's not true.  Since he first came into my life, I was doing one of my favorite things--walking through the bookstore--I have done everything in my power to forget him.  I staunchly deny, rather too staunchly I'll grant you, that his book can hold my interest from cover to cover.  I proclaim, to myself and the one friend aware enough to be reading  urlLink his primary reason  for being considered one of the most intelligent of the many quite idiotic popular culture figures without my having referred her, that anything can make it to the the #1 spot of the Bookseller's Choice List in Chapter 11--they just want to sell all the copies they ordered hoping to catch some of the run-off of customers who tried to get it at Borders (but they were sold out) for everyone on the under $15 portion of their Christmas/Hanukkah list.  Resist, resist, resist I did.  Just because everyone was talking about it didn't mean I was going to jump up and dive in as well.  And by everyone, I don't even mean the worst kind of everyone--I mean all the smart,  hip , bookish twenty-somethings like myself.  Though I'll wager they know a bit more about the plethora of coffees offered at Starbucks and the designs of Birkenstocks offered in The States than I.  No matter that the everyone of whom I am speaking are normally a group I don't mind being lumped in with--could be worse, after all.  Feelings of selling out and being common descend on me whenever I'm confronted with decisions about going with the rest of the pack.  I absolutely can't do it.  Must be my own woman.  Must chart my own course.  Must do exactly as I choose only because it is, naturally, what I would do without outside influence.  Of course this isn't always possible, but I give it my damnedest, believe you me.  So, though I, secretly, instantly fell in love with the title (positively creamed my panties at the thought that God made men near my age that clever) I outwardly put up the best defense a book junkie could to buying anything Mr. Smarty-Pants-Next-Brilliant-Young-Thing-Eggers wrote.  (For the next 5 years at least--long enough for the fervor to have died down and my interest could safely have had no origination in the current hoopla).  What follows is the abbreviated tale of our one-sided, petulantly anguished relationship.  I'm thinking of calling it...well, I'm sure it's quite obvious, if you know who Dave Eggers is, that the title of this entry is an allusion (quite a clever little homage, though I say so myself) to  urlLink his most lauded print work.   I saw this book in every bookstore between here and Savannah, on the most prominent of displays, and arrogantly walked by it each time after my initial perusal.  But it haunted me.  For a full 3 years it has haunted me.  Then he started appearing in almost all of the periodicals I read (obviously other than his own)--even in Spin magazine.  Discussing one female artist I'm already truly enamored of and one I'll soon be, thanks to his tantalizing description of her.  Which is where you find me.  At the end of our rendez-vous.  I told you it was a short tale...though not quite yet the end, because I have not yet read the book.  I just know that I can no longer run from it.  I must pick it up.  I read, again today, yet another wrenchingly beautiful excerpt from it.  How can I not have more of him?  And why do I feel betrayed because I also found out in the article that excerpted this new portion which has forced me to let Dave in, that he is married?  You mean...he hasn't been thinking about me the entire time I've been staging the "Not Giving Eggers a Second Thought" play?  Oh.  With only a few other books have I had the title or the author give pursuit of me like Eggers has.   Wuthering Heights ,  Pride and Prejudice , Joyce's  Portrait...  all followed me around.  And two out of three deemed brilliant, respectively, by me ain't a bad record.  So, yeah.  Me and Dave are meeting up.  Finally.  But just so that I can maintain a smidge of my dignity...certainly not before I finish my meeting with  urlLink Maria McCann.   So there.  I  will  lay down for Mr. Eggers, (even pretend I don't want it as much as I do) but only when I'm good and ready.

        "We have all of us a secret being, mining deep and invisible within, opening out at our mouths when we kiss." As Meat Loves Salt , Maria McCann   Besides being one of the most beautiful sentences I've read this week, I believe this to be true. However, I do also believe that my own secret being is never content unless she presents herself to the world, if just a bit, by allowing those who look on us, i.e. she and I, to but look at my face and immediately know exactly what I am thinking.  I am an incredibly gifted liar, though I seldom use my powers for evil. (Shut your mouths, friends. This is not the time for your contradictions.) Mostly, I spend the day trying to mask a face that never wants to be masked. I might never part my lips, wet them with my tongue and then give an utterance, yet, still I communicate volumes. I wish I were able to despise someone without always having them know it. I wish I were able to pine for a man without him  seeing  me lap him up from beneath my eyelashes. I wish I were able to mimic that blankness of face that comes quite naturally to the...slow witted. Though that is  all  I covet of them, it would be a cherished gift for a girl who is hardly ever able to be quiet...be still...where her face is concerned.  Perhaps it wouldn't be so great a thing if I didn't already take up more than my fair share of space in the universe by filling it with my invisible talk. All day, to anyone (I'm interested in) I can go on and on and on and on...and I do...with nary a breath taken to fuel the start of the next oral dissertation. So, it would be no one's loss, I think, especially my mother's, if my face weren't so very loud, revealing even the most nuanced of my mental processes.  And the older I get, the more sophisticated the language of my countenance becomes. Soon, I may as well shout out loud all the secret things I would never, ever say to the opposite sex (even those whose affection has been plainly stated). With them, especially, I never want to reveal anything so that they have no idea how much power they have over me. Even there, though, I constantly say things to counteract what they think they see--which is always the truth--by actually saying something absolutely antithetical. They cannot win.  I  win. I  always  win.  Once, a long time ago, I was caught. I was completely captivated by something a man was saying. Something truly brilliant. He was that, consistently, so every time I talked to him, I grew more and more agitated by being in a space too small to hold both our energies. And all we were doing was talking; my mind being written on by his. He had the habit of looking at me as if in private conversation, though there were always others at hand. I was addicted to those "beholdings" for a while.  Suddenly, he stopped talking and asked, "What are you thinking?"  "Nothing," I responded. I felt all manner of blushes inside.  "Surely you are thinking something...come, I must have you share it." I looked at him, begging, quite earnestly, to be released from his gaze and the answer it demanded I give him. No luck there. Eons passed. He didn't move. I had to take us forward, my face having stopped us cold.   I smiled, somehow coyly and nervously, both at once, and spoke. "I was just thinking that..." I didn't dare tell all. I did tell him some--the completely academic ideas that were flowering in my head about a novel we happened to be reading. So, yet again, I was able to rescue us from her--my secret inside being fairly gagging for him to know all my secrets. Even those supposedly buried deepest--the ones concerning him.  Later, I found out that maybe I'd only been able to keep quiet where the others were concerned. Someone present at the moment of my near unveiling told me that it seemed as if he were flirting with me because he'd said, "you have quite an enigmatic smile." Bliss, that moment. I walked on a cloud for a week. But I'd missed hearing him say it himself, I guess it was as I was scrambling to be able to articulate something not quite as uncouth as I had been mostly thinking.   My secret being, I fear, will not be waiting for any other-worldly kisses to do real damage to me. She tells all, no matter the consequences. Thrilling though it may be, sometimes, there is still more danger in this curse than amusement and I want, desperately, to get it in check before some lesser man takes advantage of the knowledge she provides him.  A few days ago, someone said that I "seemed like a house divided against herself..." Touché.

        And There Were Ghosts Came Back  -Fuego  There were children went forth everyday, and the first texts they looked upon, which were certain to be no part of themselves, those texts they devoured, And those texts, like so much else, became a part of them slowly eclipsing their own beautiful little truths, quietly diminishing each little body’s relevance in the world, yes,  by beginning in the world of the classroom. And so, for certain parts of days, then, later, for whole days together, then, ultimately for many years or stretching cycles of years these children went forth whole, came back fragmented so that everyday, they were stan-dar-di-zedly richer and  soulshearts  poorer, both at once. Such violence, that.  Such service, that?     You know these brown children well. You know these red children well. You know these yellow children well. For, You fill them up to brimming, my God, to brimming with what you’re absolutely certain they need. Aware as you are. Bleeding as your heart is. Liberal as your vote, most of the time, registers. Revolutionary as the photograph of Che on the wall, whom they will never, of course, read in your world. There is no place for Che. There is no time for Che. There is no translation for Che.   Instead,  Dickens became part of these children, and Emerson and Thoreau. Bradbury, Forster, Steinbeck, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Huxley, Conrad, and JOYCE.      Those skirted soldiers Chopin, Woolf, Bronte I and Bronte II, Eliot, Austen, and Shelley became a token part, produced a flicker, moved on so that Williams, Miller, Chekhov, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Sophocles could paint with pens on their little minds. Ah, so full, so full of goodness.  And they were filled to brimming with the very best of truth, beauty, art--as dictated by 10% of the global land mass. Seems, illogical.  Somehow, is not.  For those who refuse to see.  And they came to know by rote:  Once upon a time and a very good time it was... It is a truth universally acknowledged... It was a pleasure to burn... There was no possibility of taking a walk that day... When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow... In the country of Westphalia...  And they all became a part of them.  And what is not there, especially in the case of these self-loathing angels forced into complicity, tells much more.  The:  They say when trouble comes close ranks... My world is compressed... The rains were so late that year... This is how, one sunrise, we cut down them canoes... May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month... Barrabas came to us by sea ...are never considered, let alone recite-able proof positive that they are well read. So many, so many more. And the children may wonder what else there is, fleetingly, before they again return to devouring what will make them successful.   ...the fascination of the abomination...   This brown child hangs her head low, lower still, for not knowing, and for not fighting to know, and for how full to brimming she used to be proud of being.  All of these pieces became part of those children who went forth everyday, (the wealth and the poverty) and who now go (confidently and ashamed) and will always go forth everyday (until the end of time, or until, in a symbolic gesture toward moving in the right direction, the children go forth to murder the entire Modern Library Board. Even Maya Angelou, who could not be bothered to show up and vote for that historic, publishing house coup du monde).  _______________  My prose, today, will be brief. I hope that my poetry is screaming what I don't have the inclination to say plainly...at this moment.   I am a bit sick of soul and it will no longer allow me to keep quite separate from this blog anything really telling about the program of graduate study in which I am currently enrolled. I have tried, my God, have I tried to leave that business away from this page. But I can't write today...and writing again here is long overdue...without at least a vague reference to the sadness and disappointment and hurt which has brought me to tears at least ten times over in the last three days alone. Having a heart and living in the world is a nasty business I grow very weary of...these days.  This poem was written for a class. The assignment was to use Whitman's "There Was a Child Went Forth" as the model for our own poem. Beginning the day the poem was due, my professor asked students to share their poems with the entire class. Not mine.  Often, I find that the best way to live the rest of my life (the majority of which has nothing at all to do with this bit of graduate work) with some happiness and tranquility is to leave it where it is. Don't bring its issues home  all of the time . If I had done, the stuff in my veins would have turned into the most toxic of acids by now. My mother has always tried to keep me calm, so I don't hurt myself by letting everything touch me so very deeply. So, I've tried to forbear. I have mastered measured breathing and sitting on my hands which can shake quite uncontrollably when I am disquieted. I swallow words...I smolder...but I swallow the bile. And perhaps more than anything else I've ever shared with this group of people, I wanted to read this poem to them. I wasn't allowed to... we couldn't read them all...we had to move on...no reason to abuse your classmates so close to them getting the ultimate validation that is their degree . Whatever the reason, I hadn't wanted to, but had to, yet again, swallow my words.   Why didn't she let me share my poem?

       "My whole life is a code-switch." -M. Rashid  This post was inspired by something I read  urlLink here.  The language divide between her and her mother made me consider writing about my own, not really the same in particularities, language divide between me and my mother/family. Believe it or not, everything below this little preface was going to be a just a comment--and it ended up being almost, quite literally, as long as the original thing. Far too embarrassed to post all this writing to another's blog, I chopped up my thoughts to a nice bite-sized morsel, and decided to bring the entirety here (with a few touch-ups). It would be longer had it not come to life in some other place. Still, I hope the fullness of the idea comes across.  My younger sister, who lives with my father, which means she can come and go or not come home at all for several nights in a row, has been taking advantage of my father not paying attention to her entrance and exit habits. And the family is talking about it. Seriously talking about it.  Skip ahead...  My grandmother, who also lives with my dad in his fantastic, new home and thinks young ladies of 22 years should be home in their own beds every night of the week, especially if they live under a roof she shares, is not quite as unbothered by the habits of the little street prowler (my horribly irresponsible sister) as my father. So, though it is not actually her home (in that she doesn't own it), she has been proclaiming to the whole family...miles and miles of telephone conversations in the last two weeks...that she is going to put my little sister out. :)  Last week, as I was making dinner for my grandma, we were talking about my sister--yet again. I said, trying my best to take grandma's side and say it in a way that renews my membership in the family, "One of these nights she's gonna find what she's looking for in these streets." Grandma loved it. I got that drawn out "Mmmmmmmm-hmmmm" characteristic of southern-southern locution. I felt fantastic, because sometimes it's very hard for me to participate in family drama without EVERYONE feeling as though I'm patronizing them or being condescending...(sigh)...but ever so often I find that I have negotiated the line between school-Tony and home-Nysha brilliantly. I feel like I'm a part of my family--that they can still love me even though they are incredibly suspicious of my motives concerning everything--just because I am bookish and an English major.   Anyway, I was too happy about my membership in the family being validated too soon.  I was standing in the room with my grandma and a cousin, talking to my mother on my cell, and she, too, was talking to everyone I was in the room with through me. (Does that make sense?) I suggested that maybe my sister could go live with my cousin when grandma finally puts her out. My mom said, "How? She's livin' on a humbug her damned self!"* I was floored. I had never heard that phrase before in my life...and in my family beautiful little "nothings"...that mean the world to me...like that surprise me everyday. But I know better than to make a big deal out of it--everyone thinks I'm being sarcastic if I seem to love it too much. But I genuinely and earnestly do. It's one of the reasons I'm so combative against people who lord standard speech above all other varieties. No one is going to tell me that there is not poetry in that--that there is not beauty unable to be found anywhere else in life in what my mother said. I could spend my entire life cataloguing my family's natural locution for the whole world to be able to read and adore, yet still I wouldn't be able to record enough of it.   Back to the story...but before I could catch myself, I'd said, "Ma, where did you get that? I love that." She "sucked her teeth" as loud as teeth-sucking gets and said, "Toe...nysha...puh-lease." She was so disappointed she couldn't even respond. My mother, more than anyone else, feels distressed about the divide she imagines (my God, I hope it is imaginary) there is between me and...my people. To her, though she is herself college-educated, the more I learn and the more I read--please readers don't you dare judge her for this, because I understand what she means--I am also becoming corrupted in other ways. She is savvy--she knows that there are idiots out there who think the more books they read, the more papers they write, the better they are than other human beings; they think the more fully living life and knowledgeable about the world they are. Whole other story...anyway. She doesn't want me to become like that, and no matter how fervently I try to reassure her, she is still uncertain. And I imagine her, night after night, tacking onto her prayers, "...and Lord, please don't let my child forget who she is. Help her stay connected to us. Amen." Seriously.  So before I ever tried to renew my membership in the family by, yet again, trying to show them that the living language that is in them is still in me, too...I should've known that my victory would be short-lived. And I was right back where I was before I ever even spoke--as far as my mother was concerned. On the outside, longing to be let in. Begging for them to see that I belong. Interestingly, I often feel the same longing toward the academic world--the other side she thinks I have pledged my allegiance to. She's wrong.   When the truth is even more complex than I could ever even tell my mother about. And I never know which way to turn, loving both worlds as ardently as I do.     *Translation/Explanation: My cousin, not having her own place, can't have my sister come stay with her when she herself is benefiting from someone else's (perhaps begrudging) kindness and/or charity.

       urlLink    They pay him well...for he certainly  makes me panic while he sings ...&nbsp;      5 things Chris did to rejuvenate my love for him at the June 19, 2004 show:  1. Sang "Best Deceptions" like he still means it.  2. Removed his button down shirt in the middle of the set, under which were the traditional skater tee and those glorious tattoos.  3. Covered a bit of "Teenage Wristband"...I just KNOW we're soulmates...how in the hell does he know that song!?! How is he a fan of  urlLink The Twilight Singers !?!    4. In almost the next breath covered the most beautiful part of "I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light"...which lets me know he is a bonafide fan...not just someone who was forced to endorse  urlLink them  by his label.  5. Somehow endeared, quite obviously, the most acidic bitch in the world to him. Brilliant liar that I am, I could not fucking make up the fact that the actual daughter Satan pulled from his side in Milton's  Paradise Lost --the Registrar of my college--was seated in the row directly behind me and knew every syllable of "Screaming Infidelities" just like me. Who woulda thunk...me and her...screaming out "Your hair, it's everywhere..." together? Who woulda thunk, indeed.

      Everyone I talk to is on his side. That is, the boy who says he is "something like a boyfriend" to me. A label of his very own creation, silly bastard. One, I suspect, he imagines is not quite as threatening as "boyfriend" plainly stated would be. Poor fool.  Completely ridiculous for him to think that, by the way. How could I ever be threatened by an absolute lie? Because he is not my boyfriend, though he calls me "Sugar" (as though  I  am sweet, when I am salt-no, VINEGAR-right through) every night before I go to sleep. He is not my boyfriend, though he is the most patient man I've ever anything-ed. I cannot stress enough the fact that he is not my boyfriend, although...  everyone says he has my number       (and he himself boldly says he is what I need)...   everyone says he knows what buttons to push       (most exasperating being on the planet)...   he can't seem to talk to me enough        (bit stalkerish, huh?)...   he says I have him eating from the palm of my hand       (I can't tell)...   I think about him all day long       (often very inappropriately)...   he categorically refuses to "be used for sex"       (actually said that as he delivered heated ultimatum to me,      which I laughed through as I have not laughed in a very       long while b/c I have yet to "bed" him)...   he told me the second day I met him that I was running from him       (do I have a pair of track shoes tattooed on my forehead?)...   I want to make him laugh, I want to be the reason he's happy       (and that I seem to is such a surprise everytime)...   he keeps coming back even as I tell him the most horribly exaggerated "truths" about how difficult I am to love       (poor thing doesn't know any better than to dance with      Satan's Lieutenant)...   my friends swear they have never heard me talk on the phone the way I do to him to anyone--ever       (and I'd toned down the normal yucky stuff for their benefit)    he doesn't let me bulldoze him in conversation      ( says, "Stop talking-listen" to me more than anything else)   apparently, nothing I've ever said has appalled him       (must be pretending he doesn't think I'm crazy)   he loves that I never wear proper shoes       (as in  really  loves it...nothing more to say on that)...   Finally...  although I say to him, everyday, "What am I gonna do with you?"       (as though he's going to be around for a while)...   But he really, actually isn't my boyfriend. To think it even makes: my throat close up some, my head swim a bit, my heart pound more than normally, my senses rally to keep me from danger.  I don't care what they say--he and his entire army made up of  MY  friends and family--I know who I am. I know what I am doing. This is casual, light, just some fun. Nothing at all of permanence in this. He isn't my type--any of my types, for that matter. I'm not the relationship type. We have nothing in common. Did I say--NOT MY TYPE? Yeah, well, absolutely worthy of reiteration, that.  Please note: do not like anyone thinking they have caught me--and he does. Don't like it a bit. Won't stand for it. Am not made like other women are made where that kind of thing is concerned. I will win.  Or the entire life I thought I was living has been a long, long delusion...a play where the character I don for a while is called "Woman of the Vanguard." And where when I exit stage right, right into his arms, politics aside and reason on hold, I actually am his girl.

       "He left behind a Hole in the Universe through which darkness poured like liquid tar." - urlLink Arundhati Roy ,  The God of Small Things     I am  just  a girl...really. Though I play at being a woman most everyday--well, the days where being a woman isn't too difficult, too risky, or too meaningful.  Like this one.  On the other side of my bedroom window, there is water falling from the sky. Quite magical, quite calming, perfectly divine. And I want to go out in it. I want to be absolutely free in it.  Free as I never have been. Reckless, and the woman I am bitterly ingests this fact each time this miracle occurs, as I never will be. Irresponsible as a girl can, sometimes, be. Uncouth and open as the unencumbered animal there was never any possibility of me becoming.  Why...  There will always be someone watching me, someone to hide from. A man, who will eat me with his eyes as I danced there, naked, because my body in that state means different things to him--for him, he thinks--than it does to me--yet never just for me, I know. And I am uncomfortable with this play, this dance of my imagination. And not for any reason that I think will be immediately apparent. Because the man of my imagination, imposing himself on my own private dance betwixt myself and Wonder, is no stranger to me. He is the man--whichever man may come--whose loving I can no longer resist, wage war against...protest until I am in full tears and out of all breath. He that I enfold a piece of my heart in a napkin and pass it to...which he will take great care of...or lose track of...or toss aside all together, as is his wont. Nothing at all for me to do about it, because women give their hearts freely, right? I don't know. Since, as I have  just  written, I am  just  a girl. And mine has been stolen from me.  Quite a masterful little thief, a man can be, when your heart is his pilfery. Sneak right up to your face, their palms up and always in view, and kiss you completely devoid of force, yet somehow backing you into a corner where going through him is the only way you can see light again.  A corner, by the way, that you aren't even certain you want to leave, now that you have got yourself pushed in there. How can I love a trap...that leaves me blind...and helpless...without protection he doesn't give. And how can I want more, my God, the yearning is the worst. A deep, deeper, run-right-through-me sort of ache only a lover can cure...again, as is his wont.  And I'm smart, so imagined--rather hardly, rather concretely--I was immune. But because he decided to place me on a pedestal, and then loved me before he ever even kissed me, ever even held me close to him, it is my task to  maintain some sort of balance so that I fall off later rather than sooner. Because I certainly will fall. And he certainly will no longer be interested in catching me. And I'll have to burst into flames--for cleansing's sake--to get ready for the next time it happens all over again. Because now that I know this goodness, how can I not risk certain danger to have more of it when I lose this present bit.  A woman's business, wading through these waters. Because a girl can still pretend and play. Pretend that a decision doesn't have to be made, play by blowing kisses through air never having to press them to pulsing flesh.  With sweetness and threat as I have never experienced at once, a man has made me blink him into reality, where now my turn is serious because his last was as serious as I can conceive at this stage–like in a novel–and I don’t know how the page turns.  Though I absolutely know how this ends–and it will–because all of human history won’t just skip around me.  I, too, will get bowled over–as so many have done before..as I myself will be again, after.  No more play, though I can’t get away from the fact that I didn’t sign up for this–was looking for entertainment, I swear.  But this is my life, and I’m desperately afraid to go on and just live it. If it were all right with the universe, were it my choice, I think I’d like to have stopped things at yesterday–and have all days, forever, be just like that one.  Where I wasn’t forced to grow up...forced to contend with...forced to face squarely.    I am the best  coward I know.

      Last night I talked to my best friend and I hadn't since last Saturday. There was so much to say, and I'm one for being sure my listener gets every detail. I don't know when I've done that much talking since...who am I kidding...just since yesterday I'm sure. And she loves to listen to all the boyfriend-idiocy (adorably sensitive maniac that he is) and the battles waged in my classes (particularly entertaining this week)...so I just kept going...oh so much to say.  At the end, as I told her how much better I felt about going to school and sitting in my classes with my classmates...that I had been incredibly unfair in how judgmental and self-righteous I had been about some of them (though I've never had to embellish for her anything at all some of these people have said--the horror, the horror!)...I discovered I'd given myself a full-blown headache. Good job, darling. But that's what I've done every day this week. Made myself quite sick about all the stuff going on to me and around me. And I don't like to take pain medicine for headaches...because some day I'm REALLY going to need pain medicine and I don't want it to be ineffective because I'm always popping pills...so I've been curing myself--last night as well. With my music. And it's been working, though I do believe the fact that I sing as earnestly as the vocalists sing helps to get out some of the anguish and make me tired enough to just pass out...where upon waking in the middle of the night, I discover I had finally fallen asleep and  VOILA!...la mal de tête a DISPARU!   So, I haven't been listening to single CDs over and over...though I do that as well...this week, I think because I'm almost done ripping all my CDs into my computer...I've been compulsively--with quite a lot of deliberation, you should see how seriously I take this--coming up with all these playlists that describe the current phase of my schizophrenia. I'm gonna paste some of the playlists below for your education or merriment or nose-turning-up-at, etc, whichever you like. You know not to ask me to bring the tunes for bat mitzvahs or clown parties. I warn you--the titles of these lists are REAL...and will inevitably show how ridiculously sentimental and dramatic I am...I could've doctored them for you...but why not just tell the truth...for a change.    "Girls Desperate to Understand Their Own Hearts"   (as I decided what I was going to do about my love's love for me...wait!  assuming  he is still my love, b/c of course he has yet to get over what ails him)   1.	Mystery - Indigo Girls	 2.	Good Woman - Cat Power 3.	Do What You Have To Do - Sarah McLachlan 4.	A Sorta Fairytale - Tori Amos 5.	Your Armor - Charlotte Martin 6.	My Man - Billie Holliday 7.	Winter - Tori Amos 8.	Scared of You - Nelly Furtado 9.	Strange - Tori Amos 10.	Ballerina - Leona Naess 11.	Beginning to See the Light - Liz Phair 12.	Paper Bag - Fiona Apple 13.	Maps - Yeah Yeah Yeahs 14.	Crystal - Stevie Nicks 15.	Stay - Lisa Loeb   Baby, Come Home   (as I tried to cope with thinking I'd been dumped...lots of crying here, right? well, yes, of course.)   1.	Down - blink 182 2.	Wonderwall - Ryan Adams 3.	Absolutely Zero - Jason Mraz 4.	Man on the Side - John Mayer 5.	Ballerina - Leona Naess 6.	Re-Offender - Travis 7.	Falling Away With You - Muse 8.	Just Friends - Gavin DeGraw 9.	Overrated - Gavin DeGraw 10.	Across the Universe - Fiona Apple 11.	Come Back to Bed - John Mayer 12.	Wonderwall - Oasis 13.	Pay for What You Get - Dave Matthews Band 14.	Look What You’ve Done - Jet 15.	The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot - Brand New 16.	Don’t Use My Broken Heart - Leona Naess    Gotta Sing It Out   (after having first, Thursday morning, found out that my darling boy still wanted me--though he is still "hurt" enough to not be able to talk to me himself--through his beautiful emissary...then, second, feeling like a better human being for going to and being honest at "Cum By Yah" (sp?) lunch with classmates...not to diminish its importance at all...I was relatively happy. And wanted to sing out loud...good-feeling, wanna shake my ass some, wanna rock out some, wanna smile all the way through songs)    1.	Sunday Morning - Maroon 5 2.	Dance Like This - Wyclef Jean feat. Claudette Ortiz 3.	Our Time Is Running Out - Muse 4.	Girls Dem Sugar - Beenie Man feat. Mya 5.	Crush - Gavin DeGraw 6.	Remember to Breathe - Dashboard Confessional 7.	Boys of Summer - The Ataris 8.	As Is - Ani DiFranco 9.	Kiss Me - Sixpence None the Richer 10.	Say It Ain’t So - Weezer 11.	Sweet Thing - Van Morrison 12.	Teenage Wristband - The Twilight Singers 13.	Childish - Damien Rice 14.	Last Nite - The Strokes 15.	Anywhere With You - Saves the Day 16.	California - Phantom Planet 17.	Crush - Gavin DeGraw 18.	Sand - Damien Rice  And then there was the list I came up with for my Sunshine 'round about Tuesday. Who really does not deserve a list...stubbornness like this should never be rewarded unless one is fighting for human rights or something...anyway, I made him a mixed CD. So mushy...so corny...mostly R&B...because I don't think he is ready for the diversity of my musical tastes yet.    I think I'll keep that one for us, though. Our secret. The "How You Make Fuego Feel" songs...and they've been mailed to him...and they had better fucking work, I tell you what.  And if these lists didn't make you sick...it's absolutely my new favorite thing to make these playlists...if you want...I'm willing!   P.S. Thanks to everyone who's listened this week to me moan and cry, by the way. I hate asking for help...especially where my feelings are involved...but all of your blog comments and face-to-face conversations and hugs have helped this ridiculously sentimental, dramatic, hyper-sensitive woman-child get by. People are so good to me...and I can't figure out why...but thank you just the same, ever so much.

       urlLink    L’oncle de Fuego Monsieur Kant      I'm not a big fan of online quizzes. The criteria they use/answer choices provided are often so leading (disgustingly, obviously leading)...too simple-minded...too cutesy...too stretchy...whatever they are, its all very distasteful to me. Just as they should be. I mean, people do create them just for fun and neatness. I know they aren't intended to be scientific...but just the same, I'm not usually a fan even though I know I shouldn't  hate on them  or their creators or those addicted to them. And I could lie and say that I don't. But why. However,  urlLink this quiz  looked like an interesting one...well-written questions, compared to others of its ilk. I recommend it. I liked its results. Can't argue with Kant. Well, you could. But I won't. Because I don't know as much as I should to really be able to tell if I should sit well with this conclusion or no. But...at this moment/this stage of my Kantian education, I am but content.  My results:  1. Kant (100%) 2. Jean-Paul Sartre (75%) 3. Stoics (73%) 4. John Stuart Mill (68%) 5. Ayn Rand (66%) 6. Spinoza (56%) 7. Aquinas (52%) 8. Jeremy Bentham (51%) 9. Epicureans (46%) 10. Nietzsche (42%) 11. St. Augustine (38%) 12. Prescriptivism (37%) 13. David Hume (36%) 14. Plato (32%) 15. Ockham (30%) 16. Aristotle (30%) 17. Cynics (24%) 18. Thomas Hobbes (21%) 19. Nel Noddings (17%)  And thank God there doesn't seem to be any distinctly  urlLink Hegel  in me! If he be in you, gentle quiz-takers...beware! Get thee to the nearest exorcist! Banish him. And certainly don't tell anyone.  This quiz, though, will have me researching the fellows I have yet to become acquainted with. I want to know "their influence" if it is here.  If you take the quiz...share your philosophical  match  with us.

      Without question.&nbsp;There is something about me (a look of my face, the directness of my gaze, the popsicle blue of my toenails, the depth of my inhalation...I don't know) that makes it quite impossible for men to endure me. I&nbsp;seriously believe that&nbsp;were my father to walk into a room&nbsp;where I was sitting...just sitting there...something about the way in which I was doing it would make him uneasy.   He would ask, "What are you doing?"    Nothing. &nbsp;   "Why are you sitting here alone?"    Because I want to.    And then laced with&nbsp;tension, "Watch your mouth, young lady."    What?    Most people can still surprise me, but not daddy. Father, I can script. Literally as well. His is the only signature I can copy as though it is my own. He is easy, in that way. Whatever I do, it is threatening to him. I know that. I have accepted it. It is, in fact, how I tell if I am living rightly. If he does not like it, I must continue. If he does not understand, I am on course. If I move,&nbsp;and he becomes angry, the air I breathe is sweeter. I was not surprised when one of the books my father gave me for Christmas, a few years ago, was called  Hell's Best Kept Secret . All I was was&nbsp;reassured. That he still thought I was godless, yes, that too. But mostly reassured that he has never forgiven me for loving him&nbsp;only as well as I love my mother. He will die thinking the truth is that he deserves more.&nbsp;&nbsp;   But I thought it was just him. Turns out, it is actually me. Though I have no idea why. I have yet to&nbsp;comprehend how it is I do what I do to make men miss a beat. Perhaps it is the way I am happy, sometimes, and they have nothing to do with it. Maybe it is&nbsp;that I do not&nbsp;crumble when they leave the room.&nbsp;Possibly it could be that I sing songs loudly and dance with abandon three feet in front of them, and when I am done, walk away never having made&nbsp;an attempt at eye contact.   Yesterday, my friend (not my boyfriend, though this wonderful friend&nbsp;is a man who might just as easily have been speaking on his behalf--I tell you I think all men are on the same side against little old  me ) told me that I don't believe in love. I asked him why he would say such a thing. He told me that I've written it in every letter I've written him in the past six months, in some way. Again- what?  Because I have done no such thing. I don't know anybody--ANYBODY--who believes in love as I who only continues to breathe some days because her heart can't let go of the fantasy of a man who will love her...all of her, as well...just so, just right...only for forever. But that kind of love is a fantasy. I live in the world and have never seen anything like it. Therefore, I have no proof that what I want even exists. Though I absolutely believe in it. And even as I type this, I am asking myself... is he right?     &nbsp;  Wait! No! Of course he is absolutely wrong! I am right! People believe in all kinds of things they have not seen. People do believe in things when there is no proof of their existence. I believe in China. I believe in Brazil. I believe in Derek Walcott and Kate Chopin. I believe in these things, though I have never seen them. I am right. I do believe in love. And someday, before I die, I believe that a man will show me that fantasies can find flesh. And he will walk the walk of love. And he will talk the talk of love. And he will breathe the breath of love into me and I shall know. There will be my proof. And then I will tell everyone who will listen of this thing I have, this keeper of my heart.   But not today. I will not walk around pretending that I see human beings loving one another when all I see are people pantomiming what they have been told to pantomime,&nbsp;pecking the kisses they have seen&nbsp;their parents peck. No, thank you. I know that there are others and I will have them. I know that a man can kiss the sole of my foot in broad waking day and not be ashamed. And I could want him, do, yet still&nbsp;understand that he is not enough. Not nearly enough for the risk I might someday take. I believe in more, though I am content to sit in this quiet room for a while. I will see what will blossom.   My boyfriend, too, lives with the fear of my father. He is home, now, afraid to talk to me. Afraid to see me. He thinks I am trying to leave him. I listened to something he said, thanked him for telling me. And that is all. My quiet, I guess, was something he has never seen.   But I can be quiet. Sometimes, I really have nothing to say. Why men believe my quiet means I am&nbsp;plotting their downfall, I&nbsp;do not understand. Why men always think I mean something else (i.e., "I don't believe in love" when I actually wrote "I believe in falling in love and all that that means but who knows how long that lasts") beats me.   And other women say, "Well, yes, dear. That is how they think."   "Oh, that is what men do, sweetie."   "Yeah, they don't make much sense."   "Dont try to understand, just ride his&nbsp;silliness out."   And these things are from women they think are not their enemies, as they imagine I am. When really, I know men can be better. I refuse to accept that they are an other kind of human being than I am--really. There are, of course, things that separate them from me, but the real things--like how to love and how to talk and how to listen and how to take care...there must be some of the stuff that&nbsp;is in me&nbsp;also in a man.  Somewhere. Somehow.    I believe.   I believe that one day a man will look at me and not see a dagger pressed to his throat when I actually have a lily for him to smell...which could also be a nice name for one of our daughters.

      I loved him like  urlLink this second kind .  I know that I  really  know nothing, now, about life or myself. Which is quite good. I have educated myself and actually did learn the essential thing about education, which lots of people absolutely miss. That is, what I really learned is just how much more there is out there that I have to learn and will never know. I did learn that. But I thought it applied to like books and politics. Certainly not my heart. I did imagine I knew something about loving, but I'm not done there, apparently. I guess if I were done, if this right-here-at-this-moment really was all--I'd have to jump off somewhere. Which I would never really do because I haven't got near the mustard or experienced near the pain I imagine something like that requires. But I was more than prepared, didn't know any better, to go off and live a smart/activist/literary sort of life. And continue being bored to tears at least once a week, for the rest of my days.   Anyway, who I thought I was...would be forever, resiliently, in every situation is not, actually, who I am. And after I told my boyfriend (now ex-) that we couldn't be together anymore, I thanked him for teaching me some really marvelous things. In just a short while. I mean...everyone always says you should never stop learning, trite, trite, trite...yes. But I have to really understand that some day. I have to stop being so surprised when things I could never have conceived happen to me. I think if I could find a perfect little stone somewhere that looked as though the meaning/glue keeping its bits of composite together was "Wait for it, miraculous things will happen to you" I would put it in a little baggie and tie it around my neck like one of those freaks who do that with crystals. Just kidding. Those people are not freaks. Are, actually, nice/cool/upstanding/open-minded characters who have every right to wear whatever they want around their necks. Yes. Good for them. Good for me. We'll wear what we want around our necks to help us have wonder close to our hearts.  Things I used to do:  1. Say, "I don't say that word. It is not in my vocabulary. I don't think people really understand the history, or else no one would say it." And then I heard it, and somehow, I really think it meant love. And so I used it, in love, everyday. AndI was surprised because I liked the way it felt rolling around in my mouth. My lips purse in such a way as they don't for any other word, and I like that. It is possible for things to sound sweet when they weren't invented to be. But as I handle them, put my own tongue and teeth and lips to these words--this one particular word--it is my own. And his. And then we loved one another with it. Imagine if I didn't live in the world whree lots of things are possible. Because what I have learned, and I ingested, is that this word should disappear forever. I'm glad I've tried saying it for a while before I die.  2. Say, "I know how to move on--easily." Before I ever tried anything like it, I never understood people who were in relationships and there were moments that were not as fantastic as, perhaps, the ones right before. Then I got up off my ass and let myself pretend I was this other kind of girl--who is more someone I like than that other and we may have to keep seeing through her eyes for a bit--and got myself grabbed up by this boy who saw through lots of my shit. And me getting into his arms wasn't easy. But when I was comfortable there--fairly squeezed to death in a good way-- sometimes, I knew it was worth that particular daily struggle to be that surrounded. That adored. That unfathomably desired. So, to have never known that someone could feel quite that intensely about oneself, it is easy to see how I thought that it is easy to walk away from being with a person. I simply had no idea. So, he was not perfect. But he was divine for a little while, at certain moments, he was all I ever wanted--right then.  3. I used to believe I could think my way out of falling in love. That reason had something to do with it. And it just sat there, quietly laughing at me, I guess. Falling in love, that is. Knowing that when I was hit--I was going to really be hit. As I am. As I hope to be again, whenever. I'm so open right now.  4. Think that everything was according to my time scale; that I would always call the shots.  5. I used to say, all the time, that I was always falling in love, but I guess not really mean it. And I do, I think. Ushering one thing out and maybe tinkling with another thing so soon is...nice. And young. And not as serious and end-all as I have a tendency to make things.  Hi. Nice to meet you.

          "Can you feel my soul, there in the darkness, breathe on you?"  -Edmond Rostand,  Cyrano de Bergerac    Far too afraid to ask for what I want, anyone who gets to know me well enough figures out that what they see I need or deeply desire, if there is anything at all they can do about it, they will have to force it upon me. It is such a deeply implanted and immovable stone in my belly that it prevents me, even, from accepting the kindness of the most beloved of my acquaintance. Strangers certainly need not attempt. No hope there.  I look around at other people, who easily ask and ask and ask, and then I see them acquire. So, I think I could, too. Because certainly I want things. But I never want in a way that can separate the denial of my object. Wanting is inevitably, for me, all mangled up by the possibility of rejection. A possibility so strong, I had better not take the chance. There is no such thing as rejection if the question goes unasked, if the outstretched palm stays hidden, if vulnerability is masked. I say to daft me.  So, I am good at hiding. All I have to do is avert my eyes and I imagine I am invisible before anything or anyone I don't want to face when they have what I want or need. If I have a thing called a sixth sense, it is to know that as I am hiding from you, you are trying to seek me out. But I will resist. So afraid of what I will see there, what the answer to my request will be. And if I was a right-thinking person, more than what I actually am, I would think--why in the world would anyone work so hard to draw you out if it was going to end in badness? Why would that woman across the room work to smile at you if she was really thinking you're an awful sort of human being? I don't know. But the truth is that I act everyday guided by foolishness such as this. And if I can tell about it/write about it, shouldn't I know better? Shouldn't that mean I'm doing something to mend to get away from that? In the best of all possible worlds it would. Not here, thank you very much. Our sense has gone out to a long lunch. It is sitting at a red light somewhere in town, staring blankly ahead wondering if the body it abandoned is worth returning to. So, I am as I am, until it decides whether it will come back to me. And I will not ask with my eyes or my smile or any discernible thing. Fighting for  me  is work too hard to bother with. Can't dredge up the necessary bravery at key moments where it is the essential thing. If I could just speak or just look or just touch. Just ask. If only, if only...   Oh, but to-night, now, I dare say these things-- I...to you...and you hear them!...It is too much! In my most sweet unreasonable dreams, I have not hoped for this! Now let me die, Having lived. It is my voice, mine, my own, That makes you tremble there in the green gloom Above me--for you do tremble, as a blossom Among the leaves--You tremble, and I can feel, All the way down along these jasmine branches, Whether you will or no, the passion of you Trembling... -Cyrano to Roxane   The   asking   often becomes more the thing than the thing itself. It easily overpowers, for, if it is actually accomplished, I cannot even bear to stay around for the outcome, sometimes. Asking is all because it is too much, all by itself.  I can do it for other people, though. For someone else, I will fight until all fighting passes out of fashion. And then I'll fight some more, because people deserve things--happiness--in life.  Happiness or peace or opportunity should be everyone's due. Everyone like: children, students, the dispossessed, the disenfranchised, the ill-loved, the elderly, the forgotten, the sick, the women, the men, the human beings, the earth. Even the ground I stomp around is more deserving of my advocacy than I myself am. I'm like Cyrano in that way. Christiane deserved a beautiful woman, he thought. And Cyrano used all his powers to win her for him. And Cyrano, as everyone knows, was brilliant. If he could never trust people enough to be better than he expected them to be, how will I ever manage...remember...I am admittedly missing a few key gray cells. This, I fear, will be the sort of thing that finally gets me committed.   That I choose to not ask is always a surprise to me, though. Because most of the time, I talk with no hope for my listener that I might shut up. But there are still times when I retreat into myself, activating my "You-don't-phase-me Girl" armor and walk right past the things that frighten me so that I imagine a trickle running down my inseam forming an awful pool, which I imagine I will also actually drown in, if I face what it is I don't want to face. Ask for what it is I don't dare imagine I deserve.  I do not claim favorites. Often. " 'ardly hever, Mr. Higgins." But if I had to choose a literary character that was me...all the way through...it would be Monsieur le Bergerac. But because people will ask too many questions, I always say Jane Eyre. Or for the past ten months or so Margaret Cadmore (II). But there is something about the gentleman and I that, no matter what I could do to remedy the thing that one would think is the obvious reason I think of him being lodged deep and immovably down in me, I cannot get away from. It must be something else, something I was born with, not learned after having been denied. He is there. Haunting, but not always active. Then when I think, perhaps this time it will be easier...no. I am reminded of who I am. Of him in me.  So I hush.
