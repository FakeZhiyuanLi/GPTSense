      Today I was still sick so I stayed home from school once again.  It was REALLY boring.  But oh well I was sick so it doesn't matter.  I just watched t.v. and that's ALL it was so lame but what else are you suppose to do when your grounded?  Well this whole blogger thing is pretty cool. I mean I have a dairy that I write in sometimes but this is better b/c now I feel like if people read this then they will feel my pain in some sort of strange way.  Oh well.  Oh yeah yesterday Jessica called me and she was like yeah Lance is always talking about you at school (meaning the school I went to last year) and hes always like "yeah I'm gonna take Porsche' to prom next year I'm gonna send a lemo to her house to pick her up with two dozen roses inside, the limo will take her to pick me up and we will go to prom"  Isn't that sweet?  Oh well um I guess that's all for today I'll t2yl.  Love ya,        Porsche'

      So far summer has been boring. I don't have much to write in you.  But oh well Jayme is always like "you never write in your blogger any more" so there you go jayme. Um Jayme you know that you can't talk about any thing that you read in here so just deal with it.  Ok dear diary, I think that Jayme gets mad when Robert sits by me and stuff, b/c she still likes him.  She tells me that she doesn't like him any more but I know that she does. She is going to get mad at me if he sits by me at the movies.  I told her that he should just sit in the middle, so that way he will be sitting by both of us. But she said that she wants to sit in the middle. But then if he sits by me jayme will be on the outside and I will be in the middle.  I personally don't care.  If he sits by me good. I would me happy. But if he sits by Jayme good.  I really don't care. Oh well I am about to go b/c I have to get off the computer b/4 my dad gets home.  Well ill talk to you later. BYE!!
