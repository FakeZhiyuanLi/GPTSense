      Spent the day today helping Mary move and it was a relatively painless experience.  There were five of us to move - Mary, Marnie, Sabrina, Darcy and I, so it went very quickly, all in one and a half trips.  One and a half trips because the first time there were two truck loads and the second trip there was only one load in my truck and it was a light load at that.  The part that really sucked was moving into the apartment through a few doors and up the elevator.  Reminds me of all the other times I've helped people to move.  One of these days I'm going to call in those favours.  Props to Mary for buying a great lunch at Calhoun's and props to the counter girl who gave me a veggie sandwich and then a free one when I asked "Where's the meat?".  Two paninis and thai noodle salad with an ice tea on the side hit the spot.  I finally got rid of the ancient exercise bike that had been sitting in the back of my truck forever today although all I did was dump it behind Mary's garage in the hopes that somebody will take it, but I doubt they will.  I may have to make another trip to pick it up but I hope not.  I almost inherited an old dresser and rad leather chair in good shape but I figured I really don't want to move it in a few weeks.  As it is I have a set of snow tires for a golf in the back now.  Anybody need winter tires for their golf - cheap?  Their BF Goodrich's...  Had a great idea last night for a comedy movie - Will Farrell as America's first male aerobics instructor.  I think it has potential.  Hopefully now that I've written it here no one will steal my idea.  Got to head out now and mow the lawn, a.k.a. "pay the rent".  Stay classy...  p.s. one of these days I'll figure out how to add pictures

      After waking up around half ten today I spent the morning putzing around the house drinking coffee until around 1:30 when I finally left the house to run errands.  Of course, running errands consisted of dropping off a form to the EI office, returning something to Canadian Tire, picking up shampoo/conditioner/deoderant at London Drugs and wandering around the mall looking at cute girls - who, by the way, I think are much too young for me now.  It was a productive trip around the mall though as I made mental notes of where to drop off resumes when I go job hunting next week.  I don't really want to work retail anymore as the pay is not great but it would be a great way to meet girls and I could always do it until something else comes along.  Hopefully I won't want to slit my wrists after the first day.  I've started to have serving nightmares again since I started thinking about doing that job again.  Those of you who've done the job know what I'm talking about.  Mine usually consist of not being able to reach a table in time or forgetting a table or where my section is.  It's the only job I've ever had nightmares from - kind of like post-traumatic stress disorder perhaps.  Picked up a new book today - John Ralston Saul's "Voltaire's Bastards".  I read another of his books, "On Equilibrium" and found his ideas fascinating so I figured I try this one out.  It's really fat, about 500 pages so I'm sure it'll keep me occupied for a while - especially since his writing is the kind you have to reread sentences several times to understand.  I also enjoy (and find frustrating) his references to other authors and ideas as it gives me another avenue to explore and another book to read.  It can be frustrating when you don't understand the reference though but he usually explains himself quite well.  That's why I'm looking forward to school - to be able to learn the language to express my ideas and for the mental journey.  Heading into Vancity tonight for a short stop at Tonic to see a friend and then up early tomorrow morning to help another friend move from Kits to downtown.  Maybe to a rave tomorrow night in Chiliwack.  I've been invited but I'm not sure I'll go as the idea of staying up all night and doing drugs has limited appeal.  I know (I think) I'll have a good time and it's been a while since I've listened to that kind of music.  That's all for now, I'm hungry and it's time to cook dinner - steak with grilled vegetables tonight.  Oh, and before I forget the best part of my day so far - finding $50 in a pair of pants I haven't worn in a year.  I can't remember if I left it there on purpose but it was a nice surprise.  I must leave cash in my pockets more often.

      It's been a crazy summer.&nbsp; Haven't worked in 3 months; spent June in Oahu surfing; back and forth to Whistler twice this month to snowboard and party; just returned from Christina Lake and Penticton where I visited friends and family and went sailing for the first time.&nbsp; Going to try and lay low for the next week before heading back to Alberta for a wedding, wakeboarding and more partying.&nbsp; At some point I need to try and find a part time job before I start school in September.&nbsp; More to come soon as&nbsp;I sort through everything that's happened in the last few months.

      Registered for school today and got all the classes I wanted.  Woohoo!  Mondays and Wednesdays will be my only days in class.  In Edmonton right now.  Came for a wedding on the weekend and had a great time.  It's been fun visiting with friends and seeing my Mom.  Leaving for Whistler tomorrow and then Van on Sunday from there.  I'll write more and upload some great photos when I get home.  Keep on keepin' on till then.

       urlLink    Unfortunately the fireworks started earlier than we thought and we ran out of time to get to English bay and this was the best view we could get.  Oh well, there's always next year.&nbsp; urlLink

      I had an appointment with an advisor at Capilano College yesterday and managed to clear up alot of confusion I had.  This is my first time back at school full time in almost 8 years and my first crack at post-secondary so I was understandably overwhelmed by all the choices of classes and unsure what I needed to take.  Now, as long as the classes I want are available when I register, I will only need to go to class two days a week.  I'm only planning on taking 3 classes (the minimum full-time courseload) and I should be able to schedule them all on Mondays and Wednesdays and not have to start until 10:30am and finish around 5:30.  That would leave me all day Tuesday and Thursday to do homework with the evenings and weekends available to work and snowboard.  How great is that!  If everything goes well, I'll bump it up to 4 courses for the second semester.  From the sounds of it I don't want to take five courses at the same since the average course requires 10 hours (including 4 hours class time) of attention every week and that would be 50 hours of work not including extra time to study during exams and trying to coordinate essay writing time.  Better to make up the credits by taking summer school.  Not much else to report today.  Going to the gym later and then to watch the fireworks finale tonight.  I hope y'all enjoyed the handrail photos; my Dad had a glazed look in his eye when I showed him and then asked perplexedly, "what are those for?".  I'm sure the snowboarders will understand.

       urlLink    One of my favorites!  Mellow kink, good runway and both sides are do-able but there is a lamppost in the way at the bottom.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Once you're warmed up, this steep kinker is right next to the last rail.  The only problem is very little runway - you'd probably have to ride down the first set.&nbsp; urlLink

      Got a late start today as usual but I made the most out of the afternoon. Applied for some more jobs, filling in applications and selling myself as successfully as I could. It can be a little intimidating at first dropping off resumes and applications but I'm on a roll and now I've got momentum. Had my first interview today at The Cactus Club, a place I wasn't evening going to apply to. Come to think of it, West 49 (who called to sched. an interview this morning) was another place that I wasn't going to apply at. I'm like George Costanza right now. Every thought I have is wrong so I should just do the opposite and things will turn out right. More or less. Likely it's just a good lesson in not limiting yourself.  The interview at Cactus Club was another it's a small world story. A manager named Jason interviewed me and when he noticed I had worked at the Delta he asked if I knew Larry from the restaurant because they'd been roommates. How strange. Besides acing the interview with my wit and charm I think that mutual friend thing helped. It'd be really cool to work there too because they've got great food, beautiful waittresses and the tips'd be great. If I could work at West 49 one day a week and work at the Cactus Club a couple nights that'd be killer. Great money and I'd meet alot of great people. I just need to be sure not to overload myself. My meeting tomorrow with an advisor at Cap College will help make that alot clearer when I see what my course/work load will be.  I'm very excited for things right now. I wish I'd had a chance to do more camping and hiking this summer so far but it's not over yet so hopefully I can squeeze a few days in. I have a feeling things are only going to get more rushed and crazy though. I know I can handle it, especially after the insane month I had in March working a full time job, school, moving and snowboarding.  Going to try and catch the finale fireworks on Saturday night. Head downtown and crash at Mary's new apartment. Sorry no pictures yet but I promise after weekend. As long as I can get it to work...  Thanks for the pictures Mom; Randy's baby is really cute, especially the one shot of her drinking juice in front of the fridge. What's with babies these days? Everyone seems to have them. I've probably been out of the loop to long living in neverland (Whistler) having fun to realize they're the new accessory. All my cousins have at least one or even 3! Oh well, I don't need (want) the responsibility. At least not for the next decade.  Cheers everyone! Stay classy and have fun,

      Filled out my first report for EI online yesterday and it was far easier than I though.  I assumed that it would be some type of inquisition with regards to why you have not yet found a job and what you are doing to find one but instead it was several short yes/no questions as to whether I had worked or not and whether I was ready to work.  Of course I answered them truthfully but I never thought it would be so easy to get free money.  After that, I made my first trek to Fitness World, the nereby gym I've been contemplating joining for a while.  Had a great 2 hour workout there and I have to say the facilities are the nicest I've seen.  There is so much equipment I only had to wait to do squats and the change rooms/showers are very nice and clean.  It's been a long time since I've been on an actual workout program and I'd almost forgotten how good it feels to exercise your body.  On the flip side of that I've been exercising my mind lately plowing through chapters of the book I recently started to read "Voltaire's Bastards's" by John Ralston Saul.  A fascinating read so far although the first few chapters have been a history lesson more than anything.  It is important though to lay a foundation and provide a context for the argument to come.  Having read another more recent book by Saul before attempting this one I can already see the connections and the evolution in his writing.  On a lighter note I spent the evening at movies last night.  I checked out "The Bourne Supremacy" first and then "The Village" after.  I thoroughly enjoyed the former as I knew I would.  It reminds me of the original television version I watched as a child only better.  It is rare that a sequel will surpass the original but Damon, I feel, is a better Jason Bourne than Chamberlain was and since we have already been introduced to the characters the supremacy improves upon the identity because it can elaborate and explore rather than introduce.  I look forward to hopefully another installment in a few years.  I know there is at least one more novel - the ultimatum - but I'm unsure if there are more.  I tried to read them years ago but found them a tough read like many spy novels with too many foreign names and details to keep straight.  The village on the other hand was quite bland.  Supposed to be scary, it turns into a love story halfway through with a twist at the end.  The writer and director seems to be pushing his formulaic scripts a little too far and should have quit after The Sixth Sense.  American movies mostly suck anyways, except comedies.  All the good dramas I've seen lately have been from other countries.  Check out "Goodbye Lenin", a movie I watch the last few days, for a great drama.  Be aware though that it is in German with English subtitles (great for those friends of mine that speak German).  Today has scarcely begun, but it is already 12:30.  I believe today I will: change my phone cell number to a Vancouver number; visit the doctor; go to the gym; do some laundry.  Not a very exciting day but these things need to get done.  Hopefully I will have something more exciting to write about very soon.
