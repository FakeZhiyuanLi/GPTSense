       I read this book once called "Wither" (I forget who the author is now) and I couldn't put it down.  Turns out I should have since I had to sleep with a light on for a week after reading it.  It was about these 3 witches (sisters) that come back to this town, only they're all deformed looking bat creatures now who feed on anyone.  And they're trying to possess these 3 people so they can come back to life.  One's a college student who also happens to be the daughter of the Dean; one isn't born yet and still in the womb, and another one is a little girl who is already possessed by one of the sisters and has the strange power to transform into a wolf.  The one in the womb is possessed too and is growing at a rapid speed and in fact practically comes out talking in the second book.  The college girl though is the one the leader wants because apparently this girl possesses a powerful magic in her that she's not even aware of yet.  Anyway, these witches wreak havoc, killing people left and right.  It's pretty graphic, not as graphic as others I've read where I couldn't even finish a sentence (my sister loves those books), but I've got an active imagination and I can fill in the blanks.        It was supposed to have been made into a movie, but apparently, and I found this out online, there's a conflict between the writer and producers.  Bummer.  Although I'm sure if it were made into a movie, I'd never see it.  Well, not right away.  I'd wait till it came out on DVD so I could rent it and watch it in broad daylight with plenty of time to fill my mind with other things before I went to sleep.  I know, I'm a strange one.  I just can't watch scary movies.  I saw the preview to "Dawn of the Dead" once and had a nightmare about it a week later; so apparently it was still percolating in my brain for a week.        It used to be that my nightmares were about evil, unseen things, then they switched to raptors and those strange chicken like dinosaurs that bite you to numb you and then eat you alive, sometimes the T-Rex, but come on, the raptors are much scarier than T-Rex.  They're smarter and faster.  Luckily, I only have nightmares when I get too hot (and not in a good way -- lol).  My dad's the same way.  Now when I'm having a dream and I can feel the tension building, as if there's a music soundtrack in my head like in the movies when the blood-thirsty creature is about to appear, I just kick off the covers and wa-la, the dream changes.        And on a completely unrelated topic, I'm actually cooking tomorrow.  Trust me, this is not what I do.  I'm doing it to pay back a friend.  It's not that I can't cook, I just don't like to because it takes forever and there's all that measuring, stirring, etc.  The kitchen is not my favorite place.  However, I do make a couple of things that I've been told are delicious.  Enchiladas (a recipe me and my best friend came up with over 10 years ago) and Spaghetti & Meatballs (Disney cookbook style).  This cookbook belonged to my sister and I commandered it.  So that's what I'm making on Saturday.  Spaghetti & meatballs (from scratch), grilled corn-on-the-cob, and a dessert called Englishman's Trifle (no cooking involved, well, unless you count the... no, I was right there's no cooking... just thawing).  Hopefully, everything turns out and my guests like it.  I don't know what I'll do for my next trick though.  Heaven forbid I should have to make something new!!!  Horrors of horrors!!!

        Have y o u ever noticed how bad drivers seem to go in packs?  For instance, on my way home from schoo l  today (a 15-minut e  drive) I  s aw 3 vehicles at 3 differen t  time s  try to ch a nge  l anes without  l ooking  fir s t   a nd 3 times there was almost an accident right in front of me.  Another time for a couple of weeks I kept seeing tailgators.  And for about a week back in Jul y  I kept gett i ng s t uck behind  t he sl o w cars (they were  g oing 5, 10, 15 mil e s below  the  speed limit).  Why can't these people just go the speed limit, that's what it's posted on the side of the  r oad for.  Did I mention that in  on e of my pet peeves?  I can't remember.  If not, that is definite ly  one of them.  And  st ill another time I saw a rash of cars r u nning red lights.  Bad driving seems to go in cycles.  Maybe I don't drive enough or maybe I'm a magnet, whatever the case it drives me  batty .            Oh s p eaking of runn i ng re d  lights, I saw a county transit bus go through a red light.  Now I understand it can be hard to sto p  thos e  huge buses s o  they will go through a red light from time to time.  But this bus was already sitting at the red light and it hadn't changed yet before he started going through.  He was almost all the way through before the light did change.  What was he thinking?  Actually, that's  p robab l y what the probl e m was... he w a sn't thinking.          I have a f r i e nd who did this very same thing a b out a month ago.  She went th r ough a r e d light thinking it had turn ed  green, only to real i ze halfway through the i n tersection that it was still red and there was a police car behind her.  She ended up not gettin g  a ticket though, only a warning, which was fortunate.  But I laughed so hard when she was telling me this story, especially since the reason she was so distracted was because of a guy.  Guess we've all been there.  I know I've found myself more than once slowing down to stop at a green light because I was deep in thought about different things.          Anyway, I have to get going, I have some scrapbook pages to get finished.

      I saw this movie the other night; I won't say which one because it is both potentially embarrassing and moot. I thought the movie was pretty good though, not the best I'd ever seen, but enjoyable. However, I remember the critics saying that this movie would suck because it followed the original formula too much. This got me thinking... obviously, since I wouldn't be sitting at my computer at 6:15 in the morning otherwise.  Almost all movies follow a formula. Look at horror movies and B movies. Now, I've never actually seen a horror movie myself because I have a very active imagination and been known to have nightmares just from the previews, but even I can see the formula. Every one of these movies has one monster or baddie who is bent on mutilation, mayhem, terror, (and every variation on these). And they always have a motive or reason for what they do (mutation, revenge (mostly used for sequels), take over the world, their mommy or daddy wasn't nice to them, etc. There's the person (usually a male) who figures out what's going to happen or that there's something out there to get them, but of course no one believes him. There's the dumb blonde cheerleader type who will at some point be running around in very little clothing and ultimately knocked off, probably from tripping. There's the scientist who says he knows how to solve the dilemma and save the world but he's killed before it happens. Oh, and don't forget the token black guy who will also be killed. The only people to survive this horrific onslaught will be a man and woman who will at some point in the movie have the time to make out in some dark corner before the creature finds them and chases them again. And of course, they will survive.  Horror and B movies are not the only ones to follow a formula. Romantic comedies, anything with Jim Carrey (doesn't he ever do anything outside the box), thrillers, etc. There are very few original movie ideas out there. So for the critics to say this movie won't be good because it follows a formula is ridiculous. Almost every movie follows a formula, it's just the way it is. Just look at the number of sequels out there?! Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Star Wars, Batman, Superman, Godfather, Star Trek, American Pie, Alien, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, and I could go on. I won't even get into the number of remakes out there that are never as good as the original. I give them credit for trying but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  And Saturday Night Live needs to stop trying to make a movie out of a skit. It doesn't work. ...and that's the way the cookie crumbles....

      Some of my favorite foods ever are the ones everyone else seems to make that face over like they're gonna be sick.  You know that face.  You've probably made it a few times yourself. Here's 4:   *almost burnt cheese (especially on mac & cheese or leftover in a frying pan)     *saltine crackers with chocolate frosting     *liver &amp; onions     *pickle juice straight from the jar (as kids, my sister and I would see who would get to it first.  Sometimes it took  forever  for someone to eat that last pickle)         And of course, I have to round out that with some of the worst foods I've ever had.    *okra.    When I was a kid, my family and I used to rag on my mom so bad about the food at dinner and she finally said something about it... okay a lot of something.  We were all deeply apologetic and rightly chastised and made a vow not to criticize her cooking again.  Then my mom served okra.  Like with most other vegetables she cooked, she boiled it -- and if you've ever boiled okra you know what's coming next.  She brought it to the table and we all sat politely and quietly, waiting to pray so we could eat.  We prayed and then started passing the dishes around.  I was the first one to grab the bowl of okra.  I put on a brave face (I'm not a big vegetable eater anyway) and prepared to dish myself some.  When I brought the spoon piled high with okra from the bowl to my plate it left a trail of slime, bridging the gap between the two dishes.  Everyone froze, staring in horror, not wanting to say anything but dreading having to put some on their plate.  My mom took pity on us and snorted with laughter before letting go.  Pretty soon we were all cracking up and she eventually took it off the table.  But I've never looked at okra the same again.   *squid.    My dad tried to make us kids eat squid once.  He bought some calamari patties and told us they were mock veal.  We believe him right up until we had our first bite.  We all knew veal is not rubbery.   *cow tongue.    My dad, again, got the "great" idea of making tongue for his family after having his mom serve it once when he was a kid.  My dad made one mistake... he didn't take off the skin or chop it up (guess that's 2).  So we were looking at an actual tongue with tastebuds and everything.    *drain hairs.    For those who have no idea what I'm talking about... sprouts.  My mom always called them drain hairs which is probably one of the main reasons I never liked them.  That's not an image you want in your head when you're eating a sandwich, or anything for that matter.  And what's worse is drain hairs seem to have permeated every restaurant in California.  Well, that's it for me.  What about you?  What the oddest thing you've ever eaten and loved and have never told anyone about?  Okay, maybe you told a few people, but it's not something you like to admit to.  Or, what's the worst thing?  Totally off the subject but am I the only one who's noticed J.Lo has a bubblebutt?

      I just spent the last 15 minutes waiting for the water in the shower to get warm; I think it made it to just above ice.  Not exactly the right environment for shaving.  I've been waiting to take a shower since this morning when I let the water run for about 10 minutes before finally giving up because I had to go to work.  This whole incident has made me think of all the other things that peeve me off.   1) drivers who cut in front of you, seeming frantic to get into your lane because their turn off is coming up... and they don't turn off!     2) those buttheads talking on their cell phones while drivi  ng   3) tailgaters   Have you ever heard of that song "Only Stupid People Are Breeding"?  That song always comes to mind whenever I come across one of these incompetent drivers.  Sometimes I'll even sing a few bars.    4) those guys in muscle cars who thing they're God's gift to automechanics     5) people who are habitually late   (I'm talking longer than 30 minutes, anything before that is fine)   6) smokers     7) politicians who think mudslinging is the way to get me to vote.    I don't vote.  I've heard all the arguments on why I should vote.  But I'm not convinced.    It doesn't matter who you vote for because these politicians will say anything to get your vote and then renig on all of it when they're in office.  So what's the point?  The Republicans will always hate the Democrats and vice versa.   8) people who don't keep their laundry moving when I'm trying to wash a load        That's a few of my pet peeves.  I'm sure I'll think of others.   Well, I've got a couple options for getting a shower. a) go home - but then the entire endeavor, driving there, showering, driving back... in rush hour traffic, will take almost 2 hours. b) call the client's parents who don't live that far away and find out if the shower in the other bathroom works.  I was told there was a problem with pipes in that bathroom and that I should use the other one.  I actually did call them but I haven't heard back yet. c) find someone nearby who will take pity on me and my smelly self.  Okay, I don't smell. d) take a sponge bath of sorts with the bathroom sink (cold water) and wash my hair in the kitchen sink (the only faucet in the house with hot water) or e) suffer through it, go home on Friday and take a shower then (not exactly one of my favorite choices since I'd like to take a shower today)  So what do you readers think?  Which option should I go with? A, B, C, D, or E

      I was reading the Food & Wine section of the paper today, not a section I tend to be drawn to, and there was an article on cupcakes.  Apparently, cupcakes are the new rage, fad, it thing being seen at everything from an office party to a wedding.  The picture of a Boston Creme cupcake on the cover looked delicious!  The article talks about how these cupcake bakeries are opening up and offering such delights as vanilla cupcakes with real butter frosting and a sugar flower on top, or maybe a gold leaf.  Sprinkles are too common for these gourmet treats.  One place even offers it's customers a chance to decorate their own cupcakes.  Sounds like a lot of work to me and if I wanted to decorate my own cupcake, I'd start by baking my own cupcake.  But the funniest part of all about this story was when they mentioned trying something different.  Instead of making carrot cake cupcakes (say that 10 times fast) they offer such delectable suggestions as beets, parsnips, or celery roots.  GROSS!!  How'd  you like to offer a beet cupcake to a guest?  How many cupcakes do  you  think would be left over??  LOL  I hope you like beets.  I went to Target today to kind of give my pet sitting client time to leave the house because when I got there at the appointed time, he was still there and didn't plan on leaving for another hour and I really didn't feel like sitting around for an hour with nothing to do.  I went looking for jewelry to go with my new outfit, didn't find anything which is fine because I wasn't really in the mood to buy.  And I looked at their cds.  Can you believe they didn't have one cd, or even a tag showing they once had it, of Vertical Horizon, Evan & Jaron, or Moulin Rouge?  I walked out of there in disbelief.  What is this world coming to?

       I was thinking. I've noticed no one has posted any comments to my musings here even though I know of at least a few friends and family who have read them. It got me thinking. Maybe you're not sure what to write or if you should. The answer to the second one is "Yes, you should comment (if you feel compelled to do so, that is) and in answer to the first inquiry, I have a few suggestions: 1) You're brilliant! 2) You're a loser! 3) You have me riveted! 4) You have the maturity of a 6-year-old. 5) Why do you keep mentioning my name? Stop it! 6) Why don't you ever talk about me? Are you ashamed? Are you embarrassed? I'm a person too, you know! 7) Reading your blog gives me something to do in my otherwise boring and mundane life. Thanks for giving my life purpose. 8) You're funny (hehehehehe) 9) Don't you ever talk about anything important?  Well, you get the idea. And I'm sure you have lots of other profound and neurotic things to say about my posts. Hey, to each his/her own. Happy commenting!!!

        I was rejected yesterday. I'm still reeling in the aftermath of the destruction of what could have been a beautiful relationship. What's hardest of all is I didn't seek this one out. I received a letter in the mail, inviting me to hook up with this one. I was confused. How did this one get my address? Then with sudden dread I remembered my little foray onto the internet a few months back when I was looking for something more, something to fill the void in my life. Now because of my stupidity... The cruelest part of all is that this one sought me out and told me I was the kind of person they were seeking, that we'd be very happy together and was looking forward to a long relationship with me. Then when I responded to their glowing letter, eager and excited to get to know this one I was unequivocably rejected. This one claimed I wasn't good enough. I was dejected and heartbroken at first seeing my future dashed on the sharp rocks of reality, then I knew what I had to do. It became my mission last night to warn men and women everywhere if you ever receive a credit card offer in the mail, SHRED IT!          That was fun! I've been thinking about doing that since last night.           I finished this really good book yesterday; it's called The Lovely Bones. It's about a 14-year-old girl who is murdered and she goes to heaven and watches her family, friends, neighbors and murderer living life. She sees her family torn apart, her mom having an affair, her dad retreating into his own shell, her sister dealing with the fact that everyone knows her sister was murdered, and her brother whom no one has really told what happened to his big sister. Some of it's really sad and you can see she really wants to help mend her family, but she's not able to. And she really wants her murderer caught but again she's helpless. But is she? She does manage to break through some people's subconscious, but it's not enough. Anyway, I don't want to give away the entire story. Ann let me have this book after she tried to read it and found it hard to follow and boring. It  was  hard to follow at first and I found myself flipping back through the pages trying to understand who was who. And some parts of the ending were a little surreal for me. But all in all, it was an interesting read.          You know, I really like Tuesdays. There's always a lot on on tv. Monday's are dull, Wednesday and Thursdays are sparse. Friday's a joke. Saturday's a hit or miss. And Sunday's have possibilities. But Tuesdays are the best, at least for me. My tv viewing starts at 7 p.m. with Sex and the City. Then at 8 is Gilmore Girls, 9 Summerland, and 10 Nip/Tuck, which I just recently started getting into because the guy from Charmed is on it and he's so cute.       You know what show is also really good?  CSI.  Not CSI: Miami, which is just a CSI wannabe hoping for a big break with a prima donna to head the cast (David Caruso).  He's a loser.  I like CSI, it's a whodunit with graphic details... sometimes too graphic.  But it's the only show my family will sit down and watch together.  I tried to get them interested in Gilmore Girls, but they had a hard time following all the fast talking.   We used to watch Smallville a few times together, but I stopped because they were more interested in talking than watching.  That's one thing that frustrates me when you're in a movie theater or watching tv -- people who chat or make little comments throughout the entire show.  My mom does this and it drives me batty.            So my morals for today is reject anything that seems too good to be true because it probably is; take time to read a good book, and never watch tv with your mother... ha ha just kidding.  Ta ta for now!

      So I'm getting a cd player put in my car through the generosity and kindness of my friend Glen (I marvel at his generosity sometimes).  Now I have to convert all my tapes into cds.  I've got some really great mix tapes too.  Just recently I figured out how to burn cds on my pc and have burned all of... one.  The problem is that I want to recreate those mix tapes but since I borrowed some of the songs from a friend's cds, it's going to be a little difficult; especially since she lives in L.A.  Michelle says she may come up north this month but that could be anytime between next week and the end of the month and I don't want to wait that long.  My other alternative is buying the cds but then that would be kind of expensive if I was just going to record a few songs.   However, there is Streetlight Records, which isn't too far and they'd probably have what I'm looking for, but their quality is questionable.  I bought a movie there once... Bull Durham... on VHS and it was totally warped so I brought it back and they were happy to give me a refund or exchange it.  Well, I went back a few months later and you know they were still trying to sell that exact movie.  I recognized it from the tear in the box.  So if you ever go to Streetlight Records, be wary and make sure you have time to take back any purchases -- you have 7 days.  I like Blockbuster's policy of 30 days.  I've heard of people who hate, absolutely loath, Blockbuster, but I've never had a problem with them.  I rarely rent movies nowadays anyway.  I just keep a list of all the movies I want to see and eventually buy them.  That's a crap shoot.  I once made the mistake of buying some movies I'd never seen before and actually never remembered seeing advertised; boy, was that a mistake.  Don't ever see "Nurse Betty" or "Dr. T and the Women".  Both suck big time!  We were having a garage sale a few years back but unfortunately I didn't remember about those 2 movies or they'd be gone by now.  Now they sit on my shelf mocking my taste in movies.  UGH!   Actually, I have a few more movies I wouldn't mind getting rid of:  The Royal Tenenbaums (twisted family movie that's not all that twisted but just very boring, predictable, and depressing), All the Pretty Horses (I guess the draw for this movie was Matt Damon.  I don't see it.  He's right up there with Brad Pitt who I just can't see what the big fuss is about), Blast From the Past (total waste of 2 hours.  I like Brendan Fraser but he's totally insufferable in this movie), Captain Corelli's Mandolin (I finally watched it last year.  Now I know why I didn't take the plastic wrapper off for so long.)  I don't have much in the way of cds and I've recorded the same songs, albeit in different orders, so many times, I'm bored with them.  The only reason I've burned one cd so far is it's a copy of my latest and favorite music mix.  I call it Relaxation.  It has all of Josh Groban's English songs, a little bit of Norah Jones mixed with Sophie B. Hawkins, Jason Sellers, Mark Wills, and a couple of songs from movie soundtracks.  I like to take it with me when I'm pet sitting; it helps me to sleep.  I have the songs in the perfect order.  And let me tell you, that's not easy.  There's a whole process that goes into making a mix.  It usually takes me a couple of weeks from start to finish.  Getting the perfect mix of rhythms from soft and relaxing to rocky and uplifting... well, you don't want to bore the listener with too many soft songs in a row or with too many songs by the same artist in a row.  It's a delicate balance as anyone who's ever made a mix tape will attest to.

         I should be getting some sleep since I have to work in the morning, but I'm bored.       Another pet sitting job starts on Wednesday. It was supposed to start tomorrow but plans have changed. That's fine with me. At least this month isn't as busy as last month where I was home only 7 days out of the month. But, unfortunately, it still means I'm busy enough to miss going to L.A. to see my best friend and her new house. IT SUCKS!!! Not the making money part though. That's kind of nice. Okay, okay, that's really nice especially since it's definite now that my dad's last major account will not have enough money to continue to put out a newspaper, which means I lose a lot of money. I love pet sitting and all but I don't like the uncertainty of where money's going to be coming in from. I mean, I've had 2 pet sitting clients cancel on me already and when 9/11 happened a few years back all my pet sitting clients canceled their trips. See? You never know when the gravy train will fall off the tracks. And now that pet sitting is pretty much my sole income, it's kind of scary. It certainly doesn't make me feel comfortable. But I guess everyone has this problem at some point in their life. I'm just learning to rely on God. I know there's no other way I could have gotten all these jobs. People are coming out of the woodwork and my regular clients are suddenly booking 2, 3 times as usual. It's all very strange... and wonderful. However, it does keep me in a constant, subdued state of panic that my clients will cancel on me for whatever reason.       Okay, I'm finally tired enough to try to get some sleep. I better turn on the fan, it's stuffy in this room. Good night.

       So here I am, nothing much to do.  Okay, that's not completely true.  There's lots of things I should be doing, but you know how it is.  Something else always seems to come up.  I have a "to do" list to fill an entire page... anyway.  Instead of accomplishing anything today, I went shopping; well, after I worked for a couple hours first, of course.  I bought this really cute lavendar & brown skirt and matching lavendar sweater to wear to a wedding this Saturday.  My friend Glen invited me and since the guy getting married is a friend & coworker and everyone at his workplace thinks we're boy/girlfriend, I was put on the invitation as "&amp; Friend".  That was strange.  I've never been the 2nd part of an invitation.  Guess it had to happen eventually.  It'll be weird going to a wedding with Glen (oops, should I have said that?  What if he reads this?)  Oh well.  I've never been to a wedding with him before.  Actually, I've never been to a wedding where I didn't know the bride and groom or really anyone before.        Just the idea of marrying someone seems odd to me.  I'm the type of person who likes to know and evaulate beforehand how something's going to work before jumping into anything.  So this concept of spending the rest of your life with someone without knowing if it'll work out or if you'll even be happy is... scary.  What if it doesn't work out?  What if it does?  I like surprises to a point, but not when it may mess up my plans.  I guess that makes me common, huh?  I mean, who revels in the unknown and unexpected, never getting frustrated because they couldn't do something?  Lucky people.  Anyway, what was I talking about before I got sidetracked?        The wedding should be interesting since the bride is Vietnamese and I've heard they're going to serve Vietnamese food at the reception.  I've never had that kind of food before, but I've been warned to ask first.  Glen told me that.  I was a little nervous at first that there'd be dancing because I suck at it.  I've never learned, never had an opportunity.  The only dances I know are from the 50s.  Yeah, not exactly wedding reception steps.  But I asked Glen if there'd be dancing and he said he didn't know, but at the last Vietnamese wedding he went to there wasn't.  Then I explained why I asked that question and he promised if there was dancing that he wouldn't ask me.  Whew, that's a relief!  I just don't want to make a fool of myself.
