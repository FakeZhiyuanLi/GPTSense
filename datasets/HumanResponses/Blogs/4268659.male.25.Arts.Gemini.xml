      In an attempt to put my thoughts down, and the lack of the presence of paper, here we are.

      My thoughts last night were if writing down notes and feelings after my shrink sessions would help me achieve some sort of clarity.  Since paper & pen are not always handy I decded to go to the virtual route.  I've been thinking alot about lists and writing my thoughts down.    This session I talked about the wall that I feel.  The wall that I feel when I want to let go.  Like last friday when I was out dancing with Dante and I could not just let it go and dance.  I feel this wall when I want to talk to people sometimes, like this morning when I put the  gate up on Daves room so Rocky won't attack Dante when she comes over.  And like at the group when I am unable to share my thoughts and feelings.

      Jin had just come back to new york from korea and we were meeting up.  We decided to go home and got on a bus.  After a while on the highway we somehow switched at a terminal that seemed like a baseball stadium.  Walking around we got onto the bus.  It was an express bus that went through brooklyn.  We did not know that it was express all the way through brooklyn past flushing to college point etc...  The bus was very crowded but we got on anyways.  The bus resembled a train in the station.  As we rode in the front right hand side of the bus we were talking and not paying attention to much until we went past familiar areas.  Then we realized that this bus would not stop.  We asked the bus driver if he would stop but he said no, not until 118'th street past flushing.  We were stuck.  Slightly frustrated but still just enjoying eachothers company.  Jins friend was on the bus.  Blonde Curly haired Marissa (the friend) said that she loves the bus.  There was also a guy who had told Jin about the bus with Marissa.  Jin started to resemble Dante and was telling Marissa about her independant radio work, saying how she was dependant on something but it was really independant.  After a while on the highway the bus left the highway and started to fly.  It flew over many areas and near the highways and the water, eventually to land again in queens.  It started to enter local streets and we even stopped at 104.  We decided that maybe we could ask the driver to let us off.  The bus went a few more blocks into a neighborhood.  It wasn't 118 yet, but I asked the driver to let us off and he did.  We got off the bus and decided that we needed to take a little walk.  We walked through the queens neighborhood that looked like residential flushing.  Walking past some basketball courts that near some treas in a park (that looked like Dormont park and the near Onni's in Whitestone).  Then we decided to take a shortcut through peoples yards.  As we went into someone's yard, we actually went into the house and decided to take shortcuts through the people's houses.  We were very cautions as we did not want anyone to discover us.  Eventually we found a house that had people in it so we hurriedly ran out and just cut through the yard.  I noticed that my footprints made an impression in the fresh grass.  There was an old man in a bathrobe outside in the front and he yelled at us for walking through his grass.  I then responded "Old man, you will die soon.  Do not make the final days of your life unhappy ones.  Do not be angry until you die."  He Did not want to hear any such thing.  Then his wife came out and she was just as angry as he.  Their friend went inside the house and before he did they all started yelling at eachother.  They were all wearing bathrobes.  I continued on.  Eventually we would be home...by walking or by taxi or whatever, but we would make it.
