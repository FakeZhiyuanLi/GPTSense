      So, I am doing this because I have been told by a friend I need to rant to the world, and I think he is right. Although, today is ok and I don't seem to have anything to rant about. Oh well, the day is young, I am sure that will change.

      So, I just found out my grandmother died last night. Apparently people paged my at 2 am but I didn't hear it, so I just found out. So, why don't I feel anything? Is it because it was expected? I think she is in a better place now. She is no longer suffering, which makes me happy. And now I have to go to a wedding today. Not really what I feel like doing, but oh well. At least I will be with friends, and they will understand. And they will make sure I get nice and pissed tonight, which I think I need.

       O  k, so you ever have those days where you just feel like shit? I am having a bad one today. My Grandmother is in the hospital dying and has been for the last few days. But because of my work I haven't been able to be there much. So, I went to work this morning and just felt horrible being there. It was actually making me ill. So, I left at lunch, and now I feel guilty about leaving. Oh well, I think a day will help me. I need some time to process things. And I will do a shift at the hospital tonight with my mom. I just really wish there was something I could do. I hate being helpless. Fuck, this sucks.

      So, Friday the 13. Hmmmmm. Either something good will happen or something bad will happen. Or maybe it will be like the rest of my life and nothing at all will happen. I have rediscovered why I don't stage manage any more. I am so bored watching this show. And I would feel bad about sitting there and reading. Grrrr. Well, only 4 more. And if one more actor comes to me with a brilliant idea, I am going to have to kill them. Maybe if they knew all there lines or all there songs or didn't goof things up every night, I would listen to them. But I wonder why they are worried about other peoples blocking, but don't seem to care that they have no idea what they are doing.
