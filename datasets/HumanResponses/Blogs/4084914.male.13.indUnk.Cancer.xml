      HOW TO TELL IF A GUY LIKES YOU:    1. The guy will be extremely nice to you. 2. He will tell you that you did something good,  even when you did it horribly. 3. He might make fun of you. 4. He will want to be your best friend. 5. He might complement you on something  normal like, your hair, even if you wear it that way everyday. 6. He will stick up for you. 7. He will start hanging out with your friends. 8. He will flirt with you. 9. He will call you for no good reason. 10. He will make eye contact with a serious  look on his face.   HOW TO TELL IF A GIRL LIKES YOU:  1. They always talk about the different kind of  guys they COULD have. 2. They stare at you with a smile on their face  and won't look away until you do first. 3. They ALWAYS seem to be talking about how  nice or cute you are. 4. They laugh at all your jokes, no matter how  stupid they are. 5. They will ask you who you like, continuously. 6. They talk to your friends about you a lot. 7. They always are flirting with every other guy,  except you. 8. They always try to make you jealous. 9. They beg you to do everything for them. 10. They always ask you what to do in a bad  situation.  Now, you are blessed, with the presence of  your love's angel. In order to keep this blessing, you must send this to the  following # of people:  0 - 4... You will be cursed, no love for 2 years.  5 - 9... Your crush will ask you out.  10 - 19... Your crush/boyfriend will romantically  kiss you.  20 +... Your crush/boyfriend will make out with  you, and will not dump you afterwards.  Now, the choice is yours, make the right one.
