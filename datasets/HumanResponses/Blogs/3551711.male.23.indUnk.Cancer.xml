      man it has been a while since i wrote anything..... but alot has happened since i did. Well for one i got fired from the ambulance job that i loved so much for some utter bullshit, and i do mean some utter bullshit. Let me tell ya dispatchers are assholes and will do anything to coverup for their own asses(you know who i am talkin about). I also found out the true colors of alot of people i thought were at least my friend but like everything else in my life it goes to show that i am truely alone no matter how u look at it. Lets see what else happened, well i have been trying to find another EMS job but to no avail, (Bad time of year i guess). Also this goes to a special SOMEBODY u will know who you are in a minute, before you decide to listen to random shooting off at the mouths of other people that are only concerned with their own jaded motivations, at least give me the common decency to at least listen to me for my side, ThanxJK thats for you. As you can see how this is goin I am a LITTLE PISSED OFF. The next wonderful thing that happened was on my BDay to my understanding i thought that if you were not gonna do something that you even promise you will do wouldn't you at least call someone to let them know you are not coming.... at least i thought that woould be a courteous thing to do but i guess i dont deserve that either. See note to self *i am never again going to waste my time, energy, or ever go out opf my way to even consider doing something nice to anyone again* because all i keep doing is getting hurt. but i guess on a lighter side some poeple the people that care about me were there, thanx mom, my nephew andrew, angel, joe, dominic, BIG BRUCE, amy, jay, stacie, LINDA, and VAL and especiall ROCKY for if it was not for him my BDay would not have been a good one,... it meant the world to me that you were there it at least made my day a little memorable. Ohhh and to my supposed friend from NH dont even bother to show down here because i will not set aside time for you anymore because i am not good enought to visit when you promise that you would... well thats it for now   bye bye

      Yesterday was the epitome of poor planning.  I was a BLS truck for the first half of the day and then at night I was a BLS flycar....   hmmm, yeah, all because Jenni was down in Rockland and there were like 18 million Volly Squad Dinners and a wedding.  Thank god nobody likes Jenni or I and we weren't invited to anything... lol.   I didn't finish work till like 1:30am cause I had to clean ambulances, and today was ok, but Jenni was late, bitch.  hehe.  BUT she redeemed herself b/c she had a portable DVD player so getting relocated to the middle of nowhere was entirely bearable.  what was more than bearable was that I got to see bridgette, hell, i'd venture so far as to say that was the highlight of my weekend.  And so much for low key, all of her coworkers seem to know the deal. but thats ok, cause if it were up to me, i would announce it to the world. Then, we sang (poorly) random alternative Seattle Grunge songs for about 8 years ago.   that was great.  so no more for now, i leave you with this thought... "I serve society by rocking"

That night bridgette picked me up at work and we went to her favorite store WALMART and went shopping hehehehehe she got alot of stuff mostly tinkerbell shirts well afterwards we drove around and talked about things for about 2 hrs it was really nice i was so happy i got to hang out with her it made my night. On wednesday i worked again at the sweat box(I mean the pizza place)it was an ok, yesterday was bridgettes mom birthday i hope she had a good day, I got home around 11 at night or so i also talked to bridgette and she told me that i have her parents approval which makes me feel so good i want that more than anything. So that brings us to today which is my only day off i get a week, I  got to sleep in today which was a relief i needed it. Later on i am suppose to hang out with some friends not sure yet will see how the day progresses.  Well thats it for now   Love, Peace, and pizza grease

      well i had some more fun 2day.  last night i got off of work @ 1 in the morning because we had a late job to westchester and on or was back we were told we had to stop by our rockland base to pick up an extra set of keys from our new ambulance before we did that, Linda,Val,and Dan stopped by the hospital and hung out abit on their way to the thirsty turtle which by the way they got lost. When we got back i watched The Hulk and the Lord of the rings and fell asleep around 4:30 in the morning  This morning I woke up a little late and we had to go to Warwick to cover for the medic because the overnight medic had to go home. We got our first job around 1 pm which was a txp to valley, which turned out to be not that bad , except that she had like 18 million IV's well we got back to middletown around 4 and just started hangin out. Ohh yeah i got a phone call from Linda today and we said we are gonna hang out on monday after work, which is soooo cool.  Well i guess that is all for now i will write more lata  love, peace, and pizza grease

      well this is my first actual entry into my log......  so here it goes  today was very interesting. i am working another 16 hr shift today at my ambulance job and we really have not done much except for a couple of jobs. I saw Bridgette today for the first since she got back from FL, I did a sort of PR thing by bringing the NS donuts and coffee just so i could see her. My partner jennie told me she was blushing when i first got there.It made my day let me tell ya she looked so good i missed so much i think i drove my partner nuts talking about her.  Well i got to go for now more work to do i will write more lata
