      i'm so afraid to look down at my achilles heel (the left one) because there is a sizable piece of skin just hanging there almost ready to come off, needs a little help.  shudder.  i have a lot of things to do today (j rice/cookie going away party), but i really must take a nap first.    *finish set-list *pick up turntables and mixer *pick up keg--about that, i wanted to get j rice something useful, like a metrocard, but i got him a keg instead. (!?)  i washed t.a. today.  in and out.

      kmd & i decided that we need to find something to do.&nbsp; we're really bored and its killing us.&nbsp; with work, relationships, and our social life, we've NO TIME to do what we love to do.&nbsp; and we're bored.&nbsp; and we've become so disenchanted.&nbsp; and unhinged.&nbsp; and things that used to not bother us, well, now they do, bigtime.&nbsp; we'll work on that.&nbsp; only after i meet this deadline for work.&nbsp; sigh.  i've wanted to internationally travel for some time now.&nbsp; since i was born.  &nbsp;

      my goal is to visit berlin.  and koln.  actually, i may be scoping it out so that i can live there.  we will see.  i applied for a copy of my burf certif. so that i can get a passport.  that's the trouble right there.  and money.  i'm feeling that no matter how good i feel, i have a certain amount of sadness undermining it all.  i don't like it.

      i was washing dishes when kmd had an outburst, just yelling at me re: atm.&nbsp; like me, she exaggerates things, making them off worse than they actually are.&nbsp; like me, we feel that everyone is out to make our lives miserable.&nbsp; it's ridiculous because sometimes i feel (and i'm sure she does, too) that everyone's purpose in life is to make mine (hers) terrible.&nbsp; not true, i know, it's just...what the hell people!&nbsp; anyways, she managed to convince herself that atm was rude to her.&nbsp; i said some things in his defense, because i was there when said offenses occured, and somehow i managed to talk her out of it.&nbsp; thankfully, it is over, but now i'm a bit frazzled.  tonite:&nbsp; i post flyers, visit w. collin and hopefully mtf, pack an overnight bag, plan my finances, and go to the grocer's.  from the grocer's i need:&nbsp; milk & bread  haven't talked to mom in awhile.&nbsp; should.  &nbsp;

      my achilles heel will never be quite right, i suspect.&nbsp; despite all of the progress, i think it's growing back wrong or crooked.&nbsp; i don't want to tell anyone about the pain.&nbsp; also, there is tender, new, pink skin there.   atm will be absent for most of the week.&nbsp; and that's all fine, its just that i want to be alone with him somewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;with romance.&nbsp; oh!&nbsp; funny thing:&nbsp; in his sleep, he yelled, "we don't serve monkey meat!"&nbsp;(???!!!)  everytime i move my arms a certain way,&nbsp;i smell the smell that occurs when i'm a day or so from the last time i bathed.&nbsp; it&nbsp;is a good smell.&nbsp;  things i did today:&nbsp; washed all of the dishes (de nada, kmd), made a mix tape for mtf, made flyers, bought some shirts (3) & something to swim in, and i'm about to clean my room.&nbsp; oh, and take a bath.&nbsp;

      today, i gave him the golden gaze.&nbsp;   he just came home from mastering the music; it is now ready for transfer onto wax, the pressing.&nbsp; he played it for me and i was surprised by one song that&nbsp;is&nbsp;like&nbsp;an in joke between us. (its not a joke, though)&nbsp; i wonder if the other songs are in jokes or secret messages between he &&nbsp;others?   atm & i have been asked to dj a party on 16 august.&nbsp; we probably will.&nbsp; together, we are 'dead bird head'.&nbsp;   staying busy is good for me.&nbsp; really really.  i think my daily pill is driving me batty.&nbsp; time for a&nbsp;switch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      atm is&nbsp;selecting four tracks to put onto 12".&nbsp; he didn't pick any of the ones i like best.&nbsp; he said, "they're not finished..." or "there's something missing..."&nbsp; my favorite one, i told him to release on cassingle whenever it was ready.&nbsp; we had a laugh.&nbsp; cassingle.  i cut his hair today.&nbsp; i hope he showers because his odor is becoming unbearable.&nbsp; we added another layer of sex.&nbsp;   we are hosting a dinner tomorrow night.&nbsp; i'm making soup.&nbsp;   after that, we dance.&nbsp;

      o.k., one more.  i had a dream that i was a therapist.&nbsp; i was a batman therapist.&nbsp; the people that batman saved or rescued usually became morbidly depressed.&nbsp; my job was to council them.&nbsp; no one knew why batman affected people this way.&nbsp; but eventually, i became weary of him, doubting he was such a good guy after all.

       if this is discovered...    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   its really weird to not listen to music all day.&nbsp; i didn't mean to, it just happened.&nbsp; i&nbsp;bet if i had&nbsp;made time to pick out a disc, i would've listened to superpitcher.&nbsp; that new one is good.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   i'm trying to figure out how to trust somebody.&nbsp; actually, my boyfriend.     &nbsp;   i'm picking atm up fr: work in about an hour.&nbsp; he smells bad.&nbsp; because he has layers upon layers of sex, sweat, and salt on him.&nbsp; i normally don't mind, but its summer.&nbsp; his side of the bed, it has his odor.&nbsp; oh, he's the one i'm trying to trust. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   there's a reason why i'm doing this.&nbsp; because i don't know where else to put it.

      the pinata did not turn out the way i'd hoped, but everyone pretended to like it.  matt quin took it out in one hit and a jab.  i had a laugh because hilary gave atm & i a 'thank you' card w. $20 in it--our first "paying gig"!  amazingly, matt quin had no idea.  dead bird head did well, i think.  have been feeling better physically, thanks to better eating habits and actually moving about.  smoothies & stuff.  i am a little sleepy, though, because i stayed up a bit late-ish last night.   am looking for more love and rockets to read myself to sleep to.   am filling out passport forms today.  yessssssss.

      i have such a killer headache.  today i've:  baked banana bread, made a pinata, and bought lightbulbs.  tonight i plan on:  hanging out wif atm and nate @ the mansion.  and work on dead bird head set list before all of that.  kmd went to ft. smith (ft. juan, ft. smiff) to visit dad & mayumi.  i don't know why she'd purposely do that.  she'll be back tomorrow though.  last night was strange:  atm totally referred to her as 'vampire', the proper title that i secretly gave her.  no one is supposed to know!  how did he know?  dang.  talking in my sleep?  i have such a killer headache.

      finished work, w. extra time for messing around.  what did i do?  napped.  hilary extended an invite for us to have dinner at the rich people's restaurant (for free, but tip).  i am looking forward to it, they have a killer black beans and rice dish.  it has cilantro in it!   i am supposed to be getting ready to go out, but i'm sitting here dripping wet, blathering about something.  i have a feeling that tonight is going to be dumb.  bust.   sigh.  am thinking about going to the bookstore and purchasing beginner's german lesson book thing and a dream dictionary.  i used to think dream dictionarys were kinda dumb, but i changed my mind.

      i have so much work today, it is so awful.   kmd, jeremy, atm, & i are going to go to one of those home improvement stores to buy a motion-detector/security light thing in hopes that it will curb peeping tom/vagrant activity around here.  our neighbor down the street, her house got broken into.  dang.  atm and i found ourselves awake @ 6 a.m. this morning. (?![normal waking up time is 9 a.m. and with an alarm clock])  we got up and had breakfast.  it's only 1/2 past noon, but i'm getting sleeeeeeeeeepy.   oh! i have so much work to do!  dang!

      on my break, me & hilary went down to anthropop to get matt quin's burfday gift.  i got him a $20 gift certif.  i'm gonna stuff it in a pinata w. a few packs of parliaments, drumstix, and some other goodies.  anyways,  i also bought the latest effort by the fall.  i love it.  it is quite good.  of course i haven't stopped listening to it since i got home w. it.  i am terribly undisciplined when it comes to $$$.  thus the 'goddamnit' in previous post.   kmd & i went down to the river to go feed the monkey, but he was nowhere to be seen.  so we just left the open can of kitty katty food there in hopes that he will find it.  i want that little tiger!  i'm so restless today.  i can't think of anything to do!  maybe i should lock myself in my room and be all arty, like make mix tapes and write letters or sumfink.  or i can be totally proper and good and organize my work notes.  nah.  hilary said she'd call me around 7:30--she's babysitting.  i fear she wants me to visit w. her while she's doing that, but that sounds so boring.  i may have to pass on that.  oh, i'll probably just work on my set list for dead bird head on monday.

      one thing i'm learning about myself AND atm is that we are highly sensitive people!  we are!  we are v. good at turning on each other and ourselves.  especially ourselves.  don't worry, everything is o.k.  i don't feel like working today, i'd rather go shopping or sumfink.  so, what i'll do is compose a list of things ranging from "i desperately need it" to "i will need it desperately soon".  and i'll throw my "wants" list in there, too.  "desperately need":  a new skirt for this saturday's campaign function, cat food, panties, light bulbs  "will need it...soon":  lotion (i know i know, but it is dry out!), a niceish outfit for atm's ex-girlfriend's wedding (?!?! [gotta look good, heh heh])  "wants":  new shoes (i like those new asics, the tiger ones), some new t-shirts, pants, skirts  oh hey, i got my birth certif in the mail today.  i can start the obtaining of a passport process now.  heck yeah!  mmmmmmmmmmmberlin.

      what is it about people who own volvos?  i know/knew several people who have/had them and i think that they are in some secret society, such a proud group of people!  anyways, atm is working on his ovlov today, it has something to do w. the alternator.  hm.  feeling quite restless today.  i think i know why.  i got my paycheck today and all i can think about is spending it.  but i'm trying v. hard to curb that desire because i want to save!  but it just lingers there, in the back of my mind.  makes concentrating on work v. difficil.   the weather is lovely today, not hot.  it's cool, grey, and rainy.  a bit of thunder, but not the scary kind.  going to get a slice @ vino's for lunch.

      i forgot to mention the little monkey (aka le tigre, big head) that i met last night.  atm and i went on a walk, we went to the river.  slayer (that loud loud band) was playing across the river.  atm watched and listened, but i got bored so i wandered a bit and ran across this grey/black/white/striped kitten.  at first he wouldn't let me anywhere near him.  but eventually he came around and let me pet him.  this little monkey was alone and surprisingly healthy for a feral one.  i plan on visiting him again w. little bits of food.  my ultimate plan is to get him to stay w. us.  i'm pretty sure atm and kmd will not be happy, but once they see this thing, their minds will be changed.  heh.  disclaimer:  atm and i don't listen to slayer.  i have respect, but c'mon!  i prefer something else.

      atm and i are going out tonight, the classic dinner and a movie.  had lunch w. mom and i made her laugh, which always makes me happy.  she has this infectous, hearty laugh.  afterward, we went to the 99 cent store next to where we had lunch and i bought some potholders because ours mysteriously disappeared.  they have lobsters on them!  i also bought a bag like the one i got in nyc (at the 99 cent store!) to replace the one that is in permanant use, holding stuff in my closet.  these bags are great, ideal for taking to the beach or any other body of water.   we've another peeping tom!  in addition to installing motion-sensing lights, we're gonna put a really mean note in the window that tells our tom that a) we're on to him and b) get lost or else.  i can get a bit defensive about this kind of thing, esp. since i live w. little sister.  so my threat of 'or else' is v. real.  hi-yah!  i am out of money, in the negatives!   must get ready for date date date!

      i'm in a real bad way.  i'm always tired and bored.  i need to get out more and move move move.  went to the lake yesterday w. kmd, jeremy, and nate.  kmd, jeremy, and i were paddling our way further out in the lake to float and escape the masses, nate stayed behind and sat on the edge of the cliff to watch/daydream.  kmd points and yells, "look at the albino!" it was v. funny, nate is so pale!   i've bad eyesight, but i saw him give us all some vulgar hand gesture.  i need to go on a walk, a long one.  maybe when its not so hot out, but i really really need to go on one.  but i need headphones, too.  mine were ruined.   it so happens that atm is working on issue 2 of teeth in the rug.  he is killer.

      this is a time where i have to stretch things just a little further, like the bit of cash i have in the bank until my next check, my patience w. people, and those last few cigarettes.  i know i will prevail, but really, i just want to get ahead some.  please!   i don't even get the chance of hoping to win the lottery because there isn't one where i live.  sigh.

      the name comes from atm's zine which is based entirely on dreams people had and writ out.  its o.k.  but i like the name.  the submissions are o.k.  but i think some people try way too hard to tell their dream.  almost as if they make it up as they go along, which is o.k., i guess.
