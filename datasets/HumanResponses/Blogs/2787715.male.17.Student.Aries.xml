      Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile And you use it only for me Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile And you use it only for me  &nbsp; So use it and prove it Remoce this whirling sadness I'm losing, I'm bluesing But you can't save me from my sadness  &nbsp; Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile And you use it only for me Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile And you use it only for me  &nbsp; So save me I'm waiting I'm needing, hear me pleading And soothe me, improve me I'm grieving, I'm barely believing it now, now  &nbsp; When you are flying around and around the world And I'm lying alonely I know there's something sacred and free reserved And received by me only

      Now that she's back in the atmosphere  With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey  She acts like summer and walks like rain  Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey  Since the return from her stay on the moon  She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey   Tell me did you sail across the sun  Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded  And that heaven is overrated   Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star  One without a permanent scar  And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there   Now that she's back from that soul vacation  Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey  She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo  Reminds me that there's time to grow, hey, hey   Now that she's back in the atmosphere  I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane  Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  And head back to the Milky Way  And tell me, did Venus blow your mind  Was it everything you wanted to find  And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there   Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken  Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong  Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation  The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me   Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet  Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day  And head back toward the Milky Way   Repeat 1st Chorus

      Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?  Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?  I must be strong and carry on,  'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.   Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?  Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?  I'll find my way through night and day,  'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.   Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.  Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please.   Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,  And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.

      My love  I'll never find the words, my love  To tell you how I feel, my love  Mere words could not explain  Precious love  You held my life within your hands  Created everything I am  Taught me how to live again   Only you  Cared when I needed a friend  Believed in me through thick and thin  This song is for you  Filled with gratitude and love   God bless you  You make me feel brand new  For God blessed me with you  You make me feel brand new  I sing this song 'cause you  Make me feel brand new   My love  Whenever I was insecure  You built me up and made me sure  You gave my pride back to me  Precious friend  With you I'll always have a friend  You're someone who I can depend  To walk a path that never ends   Without you  My life has no meaning or rhyme  Like notes to a song out of time  How can I repay  You for having faith in me

      Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,  And it seems as though the writings on the wall,  Superstar you finally made it,  But once your picture becomes tainted,  It's what they call,  The rise and fall [x2]   I always said that I was gonna make it,  Now it's plain for everyone to see,  But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners,  Just casualties,  I know that everything is gonna change,  Even the friends I knew before me go,  But this dream is the life I've been searching for,  Started believing that I was the greatest,  My life was never gonna be the same,  Cause with the money came a different status,  That's when things change,  Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own,  Blinded by all the pretty girls I see,  I'm beginning to lose my integrity   Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,  And it seems as though the writings on the wall,  Superstar you finally made it,  But once your picture becomes tainted,  It's what they call,  The rise and fall   I never used to be a troublemaker,  Now I don't even wanna please the fans,  No autographs,  No interviews,  No pictures,  And less demands,  Given advice that was clearly wrong,  The type that seems to make me feel so right,  But some things you may find can take over your life,  Burnt all my bridges now I've run out of places,  And there's nowhere left for me to turn,  Been caught in comprimising situations,  I should have learnt,  From all those times I didn't walk away,  When I knew that it was best to go,  Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart,   Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,  And it seems as though the writings on the wall,  Superstar you finally made it,  But once your picture becomes tainted,  It's what they call,  The rise and fall   Now I know,  I made mistakes,  Think I don't care,  But you don't realise what this means to me,  So let me have,  Just one more chance,  I'm not the man I used to be,  Used to beeeeeeeeeee   Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,  And it seems as though the writings on the wall,  Superstar you finally made it,  But once your picture becomes tainted,  It's what they call,  The rise and fall [x4]

      A hundred days had made me older since the last time that I saw your pretty face  A thousand lights had made me colder and I don’t think I can look at this the same  But all the miles had separate  They disappeared now when I’m dreaming of your face   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight it’s only you and me   The miles just keep rolling as the people either way to say hello  I hear this life is overrated but I hope it gets better as we go   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl it’s only you and me   Everything I know, and anywhere I go  it gets hard but it won’t take away my love  And when the last one falls, when it’s all said and done  it get hard but it won’t take away my love   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  And tonight girl it’s only you and me   I’m here without you baby but your still on my lonely mind  I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time  I’m here without you baby but your still with me in my dreams  but tonight girl it’s only you and me
