      ive seen a lot of movies the past few days. i like just relaxing and watching movies, its fun.  sunday night carrie, meghan, josh and i watched gothica and ..the lizzie mcguire move. gothica was alright, definatly entertaining, but i really just didnt think it was very scary. it was pretty creepy i guess and the story was sorta sick but it wasnt one of those give-you-nightmares movies. it was worth my time though. now lizzie mcguire..oh yeah lYkE dA bsST mOvIE evR!!! yeah. typically disney movie, but i had fun watching it. poor gordo :( he just gets the shaft on everything. he won in the end though. pimp.   monday night janelle, carrie, ari, josh and i watched cruel intentions. of course ive already seen it a many of times, but i love that movie so much. its very good and i really like the music in it too. such a good movie, one of the best. i forget about it sometimes.  then last night janelle, carrie, josh, will, ari and i watched american beauty which i hadnt seen before, and i really really liked it. such a good movie. it was pretty funny and i think it acuratly showed how corrupt the american family is, or can be. i liked how it kind of mocked the whole steriotypical perfect american family set up like you might see on leave it to beaver or some other hit sitcom from the fifties. very worth while movie  i wish i knew how to spell everything. I think from now on maybe I'll try to type with semi-good grammar. We'll see how long this lasts, because it's very annoying. I just think it would be better if I always typed like this, because sometimes when I'm typing something important i accidentally go into my lazy no punctuation mode, and it just ends up taking me forever to type something of good quality. So if I always type like this, then I'll just be used to it all the time. yeah.   obviously i really didnt have much to say. i just sorta felt like typing and thats about all thats been going on.  ooh friday i get to work my 9:30am-10pm shift !!! soooo excited. actually im not dreading it too much. i needed to try and keep my hours since i took off this weekend for the fourth. which, by the way, im very excited for.  we need to find a place with really cheap cabins or something near a lake. for cheap. that will let a bunch of 17 year olds stay there. apparently we're automatically just bad news. yeah, ok..  thats all. i like punk covers, theyre fun.

      yep. deleted all my stupiid little posts. i want to create new stupid little posts. sounds fun to meeee.  i dont know. i guess i thought it was time that i kind of..erase that section of 'my life'. yeah..not that there wasnt good times in there and stuff. im kind of in shock that i actually deleted it. hey, it was late. but anyway i did.  today i hit up MOA with carrie right after work to go see BAM MARGERA. fucking hottie. april, phil, don vito and ryan dunn were all there too. i love watching skateboarding. i dont know a whole lot about it, lord knows i could never do it, but i just love watching it. so awesome. and april is so cute, she reminds me of clare  and im never going to see clare again :'( that makes me unbelievably sad. oh well, it had to happen.  yeah, thats all. things are good right now overall. minus the fact that im completely creeped out and a little annoyed...but thats another story for another time.  and i love how you create these stupid things to..idk vent. but then you feel like you cant because everyone and their dog could be reading it. kinda funny. i guess.

        so, ive seen  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  twice in the past..three days now. the first time with edan and then again tonight with stef, carrie, meghan, janelle and marcus. i guess i really liked it. you just get into this&nbsp;completely different state of mind. idk, i just like all these aspects of it. and for two bucks at the wonderful hopkins theater, you cant go wrong. yep.     &nbsp;   work was annoying, thats all about that.     &nbsp;   we'll just say that i didnt go with meghan on the day that ashlee simpson's cd came out to get it. and we'll also say that we dont love it.     &nbsp;   hmm, yes i guess i didnt have much to say. i guess my night wasnt quite as exciting as some. idiots, seriously. but its ok cause the rest of us had fun at perkins.

        I HATE THAT STUPID ANIMATED DANCING BABY. and if you cant seem to remember what im talking about, why dont you catch up on your i love the 90's because they throw that stupid baby in all over the damn place. and i cant stand it.     &nbsp;   idk about this new font stuff. this is smaller than i want, but 'small' is too big. annoying.     &nbsp;   yesterday was fun. slumberparty at meghans with superKool-Aid hah. a night filled with...LITTLE TREASURES...and CATHERINE ZETA-JONES! oh, taboo. and then of course&nbsp;theres meghan travis and marcus on the pull-out couch..uhh yeah mom idk we were all just watching a movie and somehow ended up falling asleep on this perfectly made bed! ohgosh, idk. of course josh and i get the shaft in the basement on a bed of pillows and i get the super shaft by having the side of blanket that smelled like dog piss. yay. actually it was comfortable. minus the piss smell.     &nbsp;   i think i just got blue sharpie on my shirt..damnit.     &nbsp;   so, yesterday i slept until 2pm and today i came home from meghans at around..12? then i ate, and at somepoint fell asleep until about 5:30. i need to stop sleeping my days away. i guess i could shower now too since people are starting to gather. ick i feel icky.     &nbsp;   anyway, i really just wanted to say how much i hate that baby and how even though i lived through all the 90's, i really dont think anything can beat 'i love the 80's' and 'i love the 80's strikes back'. just too funny for comparisson.

      i swear to god, people just wait until the once possible situation becomes impossible. and then they make their move. and damn, it sucks. but.. jdflsmohfuck.   i only had to work for an hour today. usually, that would make me happy. i didnt have to close. but i had been looking forward to working with stephanie, max and edan. and i had to leave before max even got there. god, of all the times to be sent home early, of course it would happen when i was working with a good group of people.   happy birthday to travis. again.   david's poem is so damn good. not true about..her. but still, for about ten minutes of work, it is awesome. i feel you should read it.&nbsp;   urlLink http://wwww.must-be-winning.blogspot.com    and..oh yeah. the word ugly is really weird. its just the oddest combination of letters. i was writing it over and over and over today and i realized that it just looks so odd. yeah. write it down a few times and get back to me on that.   apparently 'fork' is no good either.   tonight i really realized how excited i think i am for college. theres plenty of you guys that i like but i mean..god. majority of our class just doesnt appeal to me. and im sure i dont appeal to them either. and thats just absolutely dandy with me.   ashlee simpson - pieces of me the song that we all hate ourselves for loving so god damn much. oh look ! hah its on mtv right now. i must go   i said 'god' a lot just now.

      craziest day of my life. worst. i cant wait for a few weeks to pass so that we can tell the story and laugh.. in the past..15 hours or so, my bestest buddy has been hyped up on crack or god knows what and completely passed out. then tended to by a mother who probably hates us, we've ruined the guys' get-together on dans last night here, had to hobble our buddy into my moms apartment and all spend the night without asking my mom, then we get up the next morning and carrie's car has been towed. of course, today is sunday and the office is now closed so we are told that shes gonna have to wait until 7:30 tomorrow am before she can get her car, but since we cant get it theyre gonna have to charge us for storage, so all in all its going to be about 200 bucks. then we go look for my car, and its gone. thought it had been towed. then us dipshits remember i had parked it at carries. [thank goddd]. then we go to eat, none of us showered, all of us looking like shit, and everyone in their mother comes to eat. all the hotties in the world show up, and there we are. sick. right now i look like a complete assfacee, i probably smell like ass, and i just feel like shit. i feel really responsable for a lot of the nights/mornings events, and i feel horrible for crashing in on so many peoples night. i just feel horrible. i really just gotta go shower and try to forget about this shit.   and wait, what? didnt carrie just have to pay 100 bucks last week when we got her car booted? ah yes, she did. god. poor carries car.  to top it off, OF COURSE IM CLOSING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE ON SATURDAY. ive never closed a saturday in all this time. so fuck partay at bryna-man-gina's. just kidding, im still going. just sucks that i have to close.   the thing that sucks is that the party was totally fine for majority of the time we were there. we were finding out all sorts of shit about andrew, jake, austin and will and it was just a lot of fun. then in the last 20 minutes, it all goes to hell. man, that really sucks.  ok. shower time. rinse away my ickiness.exoh

      yeah, two posts, one day. sucks, i know. but ive just been sitting and listening to music, and i want to post some lyrics. i think ive posted these exact same lyrics in here at least twice before, but i love this song. i think everyone should download it because lyrics are never quite as good if you dont know the song behind them. so you should download it.  "save yourself"   by sense field .  turn out the light just say goodnight to yourself may i remind you when you find you are all alones when you,  youve got to be strong thats when they call you in the night hes got your picture in his mind hes got your number, on a paper at his disposal anytime  is it really true? did you save yourself for someone who could love you for you? so many times we just give it away to someone who someone who..  you met in a bar, the back of a car and for a moment you felt important but not in your heart cause my self esteem, its been low go ahead and count it its been lower than low and i know the feeling of it stealing life out from under me  cause i wanna learn  how you save yourself for someone who could love you for you so many times we just give it away to someone who couldnt even remember your name  did you save yourself for someone who loves you for you? and loves me for me? give it away to someone who someone who will cherish your name  cherish your name.

MEGHAN donde esta?! im calling you soon. like in 30 minutes maybe. mustseemeghansoon. been too long. lol like what, two days? lol sick.  my puppy is gone. :''''''''''''(  shes at my grandmas and i dont know if my dads ever going to go get her. that was pretty much what was keeping me at my dads. i honestly havent seen my dad for then 5 minutes at a time in..weeks.im hardly ever there. fbnjlkn i dont know. im going to go eat something so that i dont have to eat the crap my mom brings home.
