      Bloody hell... really feeling like shit. Been pacing up and down for hours, can't relax, can't sleep, can't stop thinking. Can't kill myself just like that because it will fuck up my family. Nope, think I'll have to wrap my car around a tree or something. Why must I feel so lonely? I can't keep going feeling like this... day after painful day. Why can't I get better? Why can't I be normal?

      You've got to be fucken kidding me... this must be the longest day in the history of the world. I tried to sleep in this morning after getting home around 4am but no, I was awake at 7 and couldn't go back to sleep. What a pain, I can't even concentrate for more than a few minutes. I think I've averaged around 4-5 hours a night for the last couple of weeks. Man it is giving me the shits big time.  Fuck I hate being in this hole... why can't I get out. Seems like when I think I'm getter better and climbing slowly, I slip again. Sometimes it's completely arse-over-tit, other times it's only 2-steps-forward-1-step-back. But it's still fucked. And it affects everything else... I was close to telling my boss to get fucked when he asked me about work that I hadn't managed to do yet (because I can't concentrate).  I didn't really enjoy myself last night when I went out to the pub. A couple of mates came around for a BBQ and beers and we all went down to the pub to watch the footy. We lost but I wasn't really that concerned about it, by the time we got there I was looking forward to chasing. It was good to see a few people from up home that I hadn't seen for quite some time. Had a good chat, thanks for listening if you're reading this.  I should've known not to even think about chasing. A complete waste of time once again and it just gets me depressed again. No girls seemed interested at all. May be I should do like a bloke at work and go chasing mums. He seems to pick them up no worries. But I'm trying to keep some standards though... if you throw your standards away before you know it you'll be wanting to go straight to the Kent every weekend. Eeewwwwww.  Talking about relaxing standards... back a few weeks I was on my home from a pub and stopped in at one of the BBQs the GodSquad run in the park. Had a few sausage sandwiches and started walking home. There was a couple of attractive young girls walking along as well so I started having a chat as we walked down the street, heading home. I thought they were about 20 years old and both red hot.  One was being friendlier than the other and we were having a nice chat about shit, they said they were on their way to a friend's house just around the corner from my place. Then the friendly one asks how old I am, guessing 24. I told her older then she correctly guessed 27, following it with "That's alright - I fucked a 24 year old when I was 14, I'm 17 now" with a big smile on her face.  Well, what do you say to that? 17 is young, but does a farmer say no to any rain when he is in the middle of a devasting drought. I don't think so. So of course I invited to come round to my place. And of course straight away her friend says that no she  must  go to the friend's house. Damn damn damn damn damn. How bout  both  of you come to my house if you're worried about getting separated?  Why the fuck do girls always do that? Or is just when I'm involved? There is always a friend that doesn't want them to go home with you. What's the go there? Is it because they are jealous that they haven't picked and if they aren't going to get any, then neither are any of there friends? It's got me fucked.  If one of my mates looks like he is going to pick up, then everyone leaves him to it and goes away. If we are going to leave, I'll walk around behind the chick so she can't see me and signal that we are leaving. If he wants to come, he comes, if he wants to stay, he stays. If he has already headed off with the chick, then good luck to him. No fucken worrying about losing someone. That shits me. Everything shits me.  I  shit me. Fuck I'm over this.

      Been feeling better last day or so... my sister is visiting for the weekend from out west where she is a school teacher. Had a BBQ and a few beers watching the footy last night with my sister and a one of my best mates and his fiancee. His team didn't win and are going to miss the finals, but the night cheered me up a whole lot.  Going to hit the piss again tonight, a few other friends are coming over for another BBQ then we are going to go to the pub. Katherine is coming as well and hopefully the boyfriend will be doing something else... I'd like to have a chat without him around.  Apart from that, I probably won't even try to chase any girls because it will be the story all over again... wasted effort that will end up in me feeling depressed again tomorrow because I can't pick up to save my life. I like hitting the piss with friends and having a good night, but it usually goes pear-shaped for me when I try to pick up and fail. Just brings back all those bad thoughts and self doubt again.

      Still haven't fully recovered from the last episode yet. That started a week and a half ago... fuck, it seems like that week and a half has been  months . I've probably slept about 4 hours a night for that time. At first it wasn't too bad, still had plenty of angry energy that kept me going... but since the weekend I've been in pathy mode and I'm really struggling. Can't concentrate on anything for longer than a couple of minutes at a time. Hell, it's taken me two goes to write this much so far. It's like "Will... this... fucken... week... ever... fucken... end... cause... I'm... so... over... it...".  So what brought this latest one on? As I said previously, just one little that isn't to my liking and throw me down from that cliff. For the sake of people I know who weren't up to date on my situation here's a bit of filler. I had a Swedish couple as housemates until July. Brett (not his real name) was doing a semester of Uni after which they were taking a leisurely trip over a few weeks up to Cairns, departing from there to go back home via several stops such as Thailand. Anyway, I put an ad in the paper for share accommodation looking for a new housemate.  As in times past, some of the people that came around to have a look were absolute clowns who I would never give the room to, I rather pay all the rent myself. But I also got some great people having a look and it ended up being between two. Now when people come around and have a look at the place, I just try to focus on their personality and the "vibe" I get from them. I'm not too worried about how old they are, what job they have, etc. How I think we would get along is what matters.  So anyway, one person was an assistant manager of a paint store, been in the job for several years. He was moving out of his current situation because the other people in there were very slack with paying bills, keeping the place tidy, etc. All ticks. The other person was a hairdresser, working at the same salon for several years. She was moving because she had broken up with her boyfriend and wanted to live closer to town. I won't go into too many details as I'm gibbering already.  I told them I'd make a decision in a day or so, waiting for the choice to just jump into my head. Anyway in the next day or so I ran into friends here and there and they asked me who was moving in. I would say that I hadn't made a decision yet and told then a little about who I was choosing from. One person said straight away "Don't pick the hairdresser. Think about (insert several hairdressers name we know here)  ". Other people asked "Is the hairdresser hot? Pick her for sure". Of course they hadn't met either of them, so I went with my gut feeling and chose Katherine (not her real name). My mates straight away are saying shit like "She must be hot. I know why you got her to move in...   ". She is attractive, but that wasn't why.  It was only after she moved in that I found out she is 20 and I thought "Hang on - 20 year old hairdresser" and ran that through my head of some of the other hairdressers I've known. But they didn't match this girl. She is a lot more mature than any other 20 year old I've met, and after subsequently finding out some of the things she has been through I understand why. Makes me seem like a complete fucken sook with my mental state after my non-eventful life so far compared to hers. From what I can tell she is rather good at her job and her boss holds her in high esteem, leaving Katherine to run the salon on the days she isn't in. She pays rent early, cleans up, has cooked dinner a few times (and rather tasty dinners as well), is a pleasure to be around.  Just had to have a break as I couldn't concentrate and came back and realised that I'm gibbering again. Anyway, I can't pull a chick to save my life and then I've got an attractive, single female housemate with a fantastic personality. The whole time I've been hearing a mate at work say "Remember the rules - you can't sleep with your housemate, you can sleep with her friends". As I've been getting to know her she has been growing on me. Yes she is attractive, but like I said when looking for a housemate all I'm worried about is how we will get along.  So anyway she starting see some fella for a week or so, before he started saying he was in love with her and could see them getting married or something like that. She wasn't ready for that and told him to cool it. Then the other Sunday had a great morning, bacon and eggs for brekkie, sat around chatting for a few hours. And one of the things she said was that she was after someone "normal", someone who wouldn't be professing their love for her after not even a week together.  My head was trying to work out exactly what she meant by this. Was she just talking to me as a friend? Or was she trying to give me a hint? Like I said, getting along with my housemate is the most important thing. If she wanted a relationship I'd like that, but otherwise it is a pleasure living with great girl like Katherine and I don't want to do anything to ruin that.  So what do I do? Do I say something to test the waters, something like "Would you consider me a normal bloke?" or "What else makes a bloke normal apart from not telling you he loves you after a week?". No. Instead I say nothing about it. Clam up like a fucken idiot. Change the subject. If maybe some time over the next few days she says it again, then I'll say something.  I suppose I'm like that because on a couple of occasions in the past I thought a friend was trying to give me a hint in a pretty similar way so I asked - but was completely wrong. Which resulted in one relationship going from having a chat/sending emails every couple of days to her not wanting to talk to me at all. Not something I want to do again.  Anyway, I go to sleep that night feeling rather happy. Didn't do much all day - sat around chatting to a fantastic girl, who may like me, but most probably doesn't and is just being a friend. Will find out more in the next few days. I've climbed the cliff. Did I have film in that camera?  The next day I talk to her briefly when she comes home to pick something up before heading to dinner at her parents house or somewhere. No further clues today. The next day I have a shitty day at work, shitty time driving home, so by the time I get home I'm not feeling that fantastic. Come inside, Katherine's in her room with the TV going, walk past saying hello. And there she is laying there watching TV with a bloke she met on the Sunday night after she may have been trying to give me a hint. Whoops!! Just slipped off the cliff.

      How to kick this thing off? What exactly am I going to gibbering on about here? Well I'm looking at this as way to try and clear my head of all the shit that's floating around in it, hopefully letting me sleep easier at night. And hopefully without too many typos. It'll be something for people I know to see how fucked in the head I was after I'm gone. I'd better remember to do a will and put a mention of this in it... it's not much good otherwise.  Well for a first post I might as well talk about what has been happening that inspired(?) me to start this thing. Every now and then I get depressed, and to varying degrees and in slightly different ways.  Sometimes I'll just get what I'll call "apathy depressed" - a bit depressed and not really caring about shit, couldn't be bothered, just want to be left the fuck alone. In reality it's probably best that I go and do something with some friends, something to get me out of the house and socialising. But that is a lot easier said than done. What am I going to do, ring up my mates and say "Fellas, I'm feeling depressed. Let's go and do  (insert some crap here ) "?  Not fucken likely... instead I'm going to sit around the house hoping my housemate isn't home so I can feel miserable my myself, maybe hide out in my room because I'm too fucken embarassed and don't want people to see how fucked in the head I am. Nobody wants to hear my shit. Nobody wants to know you're a fruitloop. That's why I'm doing this blog for fuck's sake. At least it's like I'm telling someone without them feeling awkward and wishing I'd never opened my mouth to tell them.  Other times I'll call it "angry depressed" - worse than don't care, I hate not only myself but everything and everyone else for making me feel like that, even though really it is my own fucked up fault. Nobody has done shit to me. But still I want to take it out on someone, something,  anything . I feel like driving my car head-on into a truck. I want to walk into a mosque with a big knife and yell "Hey you fucked up gang rapists, I'm here to cut your dicks off!". I want to walk down the mall in Cabramatta yelling "All you slanty eyed boat people fuck off and sell your heroin in your own country!". I want someone or something to kill me so I don't have to do it myself. That would fuck up my family's heads, especially my little brother. Fuck, if it wasn't for him I would've been gone long ago.  So instead, I'll try to make up for the "mental" pain with some physical pain - not necessarily with a knife, though I have. If I've got sore joints, I'll give them a thrashing at the gym so they hurt more. Last time my knees were giving me a dull ache constantly, so I would go walking for hours at a time until they  really fucken hurt .  When the depression is at it worst I've noticed it goes through stages, no matter how much I try to think and do shit otherwise to try and stop the fucked up thoughts and feelings. I think there's some chemical deficiency in my brain or some shit. I'll get to that some time.  The best way I can think to describe the worst of it is like falling off a cliff. One moment I'm feeling great, things are going good, I'm loving life. Blah blah blah. Then all it takes is one thing I didn't want to happen, one bad thought to enter my head - and its like slipping on the edge of a cliff as you are about to take a photo from the top.  And the higher the cliff, the longer the fall, and the deeper valley below. And once you land and look around, thinking about how far you have fallen and how much it hurts, you really start to wonder it if is worth trying to climb all the way back up that fucken cliff again. Shit, just getting back up to normal ground where you started will be enough of a struggle and take enough time, let alone going for the top again. Let's just stop it all right now. You're at the bottom. Everything sucks. Every time you try to climb up there it just all ends in tears. Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Why bother? You see other people around you climb up but you can't. Seems as soon as you get out of this shithole, you fall back in. Why, why, why can't I get out of this shit? Even just stay on level ground? Why am I so fucked up?  This is usually the angry depression, and it's the worst. It usually takes a few days up to a week to get through this. Seems no matter what I do or try to think I just can't get out. As soon as I have a spare moment when I'm not trying to concentrate on some task at hand, BANG!, it's right there. And it does get hard to concentrate. You get 2-3 hours sleep a night because :   (A) you can't get to sleep to start with because your mind is busying thinking about the shit making you depressed and how much you wished you were normal;   (B) once you fall sleep you keep having dreams like cutting your legs off or killing the next stranger you see walking down the street;   (C) you're awake now and back to (A).     When you are awake you are full of "angry energy" - you are so angry you can't stop grinding your teeth, tapping your feet, hitting the desk, pacing back and forth, clenching your fists, etc. Ready to explode. Screw Yoda, if you could use The Force you could destroy whole fucken planets, forget needing the Death Star. You wish you could spontaneously combust. Get this shit over with. I'm over it.    Slowly I'll seem to change from "angry" to "apathy". I'll still have that energy. Kill myself yes, but not anyone else. I'll wake up in the morning and think "Oh great, another shitty day in my shitty life. Why the hell do I bother? It'd be much easier to just skol a bottle of vodka and end it." Or drive my car under a truck. Or overdose on heroin. Or blow my brains out. Or jump off a building.    So I'll be at work, trying to concentrate but can't stop thinking "You're fucked up. You'll never fix your head. End it. Do the world a favour." Then I start thinking about my funeral. Would they bother telling anyone? If they did, would anyone come? How many people that I think are my friends would be there? Should I find out now?    Although I can write that there is one thing that will pull me up out of the valley like a bungie cord - the same thing that got me to the top of the cliff. But does that happen? No. Why do you think I "slipped" in the first place?
