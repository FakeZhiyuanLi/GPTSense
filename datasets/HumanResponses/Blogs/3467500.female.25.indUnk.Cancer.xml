						   a woman who on mother's day knows she is unable to have children and whose adoption fell through recently but  who sits supposedly serene behind the piano  at church playing praises There is God A boy whose father and mother no longer live together  who has been uprooted in order to help his mother make a new start a boy who is almost to old but who when children's sermon is announced is one of the first to find a seat There is God An elderly lady whose husband passes on two years ago  but seems like yesterday who in excitment over a visit from the pastor makes awful coffe and serves up her last two pieces of pecan pie There is God The relationship between an elderly housekeeper and her boss that has been challenged by wives dying, stroke and sickness but who each day still prepares food and cleans house and  bosses and scolds like a mother hen There is God A son who takes time to visit his mother on her birthday when the other children seem to be too far away to travel. The mother who sets out her birthday cards from her children on her mantle, as if special treasures There is God  There is God

						   Once a woman comes to a certain age never having had a real boyfriend or someone want her etc., and yet somehow with God's help is alright. I mean the feeling doesn't rest on her all the time, only once in a great while does she even let herself dwell upon the feeling of hopelessness or loss. Loss for something she has never had. Is that really loss or longing? Is suppose at the stage it is not really important to identify and if identified it would cause more pain from the inspection. But still she comes to an age or place where she is mostly alright...and it is not a nagging pain but fleeting, so here then comes the odd thing. If anyone shows her kindness or consideration, loves her  as a friend and expresses it and that person is male...it hurts. " Do not care for me... please that is one thing that will somehow creep as a thief into my heart." From women she expects consideration freindship because women have never made her feel not quite enough. But from men it infiltrates the iron bands around her heart. It is an unexpected anomolly. It's like the first taste of rich food even in small amounts to a starving man give pain. The smallest consideration from someone showing genuine care and it is as if there is a light stirring of air near a wound,  reminding you that it is not yet healed completely. "Do not care for me... it reminds me that I care if you do." It's odd I know.

						   Beth Moore contends that each and everyone of us is the bride of Christ. I understand that she is in some way trying to lift the women that she was writing to to a special point of intimacy with Christ, and also make these women have feelings of importance.  Beth, the bride of Christ is the Church, not just a church or it's Christian female members, but the Church on a universal level.  Secondly yes each of us, men and women need to come to a closer intimacy in our relationship with Christ but false implication of scripture is not the way to get us there. Our level of importance is the same as it was yesterday today and tomorrow. We are God's creations bought and paid for by his Son's life, this makes us important to God.  The picture of the Church as the Bride of Christ should be humbling and reveal the nature of our responsibilities. Such as is the woman's role who is married. A couple in love who is ready to make a lifetime commitment to each other sees the good and the bad of one another but chooses to take the good with the bad for love's sake. Christ sees us, the Church, the good and the bad and chooses to help us work through the bad by uplifting the good in us-- for Love's sake.

						   In Louisa May Alcott's  Jack and Jill  at the death of a child an old hymn is installed in the writing:  Not a sparrow falleth but its God doth know, Just as when his mandate lays a monarch low; Not a leaflet moveth, but its God doth see, Think not, then, O mortal, God forgeteth thee. Far more precious surely than the birds that fly Is a Father&#8217;s image to a Father&#8217;s eye. E&#8217;en thy hairs are numbered; trust Him full and free, Cast thy cares before Him, He will comfort thee; For God planted in thy breast a soul, On his sacred tables doth thy name enroll. Cheer thine heart, then, mortal, never faithless be, He that marks the sparrows will remember thee.  So often I feel like a sparrow.  Alone. Looking down upon the crowds of rushing ravenous people. Ravenous for hurry for life for the days end and days beginning. When all that I want is to find a nest somewhere to brave the wind and torrents of this life. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top. --Psalm 102:7   Found. It is odd how you can feel alone and found in the same moment. Yet I truly feel found when I remember how fond the Lord is of his people, how he truly madly loves me. That love is my nest. Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. --Psalm 84:3
