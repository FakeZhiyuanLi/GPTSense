      "Back in school they never taught us  what we needed to know  Like how to deal with despair  or someone breakin your heart  For twelve years I've held it all together  but a night like this is beggin to pull me apart  I played it quiet left you deep in conversation  I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen  I remember I kept thinking  that I know you never would  And now I know I want to kill you  like only a best friend could   Everyone's caught on to everything you do  Everyone's caught on to...   As if it happening wasn't enough  I got to go and write a song  just to remind myself how bad it sucked  Ignore the sun, covers over my head  Wrote a message on my pillow that says  "Jesse, stay asleep in bed"  Don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)  Search your cell for something which to hang yourself  They say you need to pray  if you want to go to heaven  But they don't tell you what to say  when your whole life has gone to Hell!"   - Brand New (seventy times seven)  "Passed out on the overpass  Sunday best and broken glass  Broken down from the bikes and bars  Suspended like spirits over speeding cars  You and me, we're kings over the parkway tonight  And tonight will go on forever while we  Walk around this town like we own the streets  And stay awake through summer like we own the heat  Singing everbody wake up (wake up)it's time to get down  Everybody wake up its time to get down  End when I pass the bottle back to pee on the overpass tonight  I bet we laugh   I'm gonna stay 18 forever  So we can stay like this forever  And we'll never miss a party  'Cause we keep them going constantly  And we'll never have to listen  To anyone about anything  'Cause it's all been done and its all been said  We're the coolest kids and we take what we can get   The hell out of this town  Find some conversation  The low fuel lights been on for days  Doesn't mean anything  I've got another 500 another 500 miles before we  Shut this engine down  We shut it down   You're just jealous cause we're young and in love. Your stomach's filled up but you're starved for conversation. You're spending all your nights growing old in your bed. And you're tearing up your photos 'cause you wanna forget... It's over."  -Brand New (soco amaretto lime)

      graduation's tomorrow.  i feel like i should be more excited, but i'm just not.  i'm ready for seton to get out of my life.  but first i have to write these senior pics and cards for certain teachers.  i think i'm gonna stay up late tonight so i'll be able to doze off during baccalaureate tomorrow.  i am not in the mood to hear the millions of scholarships that certain people got and who do not seem to deserve them.  (like yvonne bulemo getting a full ride to scranton).  it just seems unfair, but its life.  i'm also not in the mood to go to my grandparents after graduation.  there will be too many pictures with too many relatives.  however, i am excited to see gavin and kyra!!  they are my favorite kids ever.  i got my prom pictures back today.  i think i liked all the other pictures that were developed that were not from prom better than the prom pictures.  i want to print out the digital pictures from allison's because aleshia took some nice ones compared to the ones from my camera that cheryl took.  anyway, i bought some photo albums and i finally started to put some pictures together.  i made a youth leader photo album which monica loved and i'm in the process of making one for youth leadership bowie.  it was so weird to look back at youth leader because i loved the experience overall and a bunch of people that i met, but we all hated it that week.  there were so many stupid, long, pointless classes and strange guys who yelled at monica and leeann for splitting a cheeseburger.  that was funny though.  i dont know.  maybe i like pictures because i only take pictures when i'm happy, so when i look back at all of my old pictures, i only see the good times.  it helps make me think that my life was better than i saw it.  i dont know if that makes sense, but it makes sense to me in my head.  my pictures help me appreciate my life more because they keep me focused on the good times.    i have so many more senior pictures to write, but i've already decided i'm gonna stay up late tonight.  so for now, i'm going to work on my youth leadership bowie photo album.  what an interesting group of people i met.  i've only stayed in touch with the seton people and semi with amanda.  i see mitch and antiono sometimes through other people.  mitch i'd rather not.  i just dont like him and people think its a joke.  only monica knows that i'm not kidding.  jackie just laughs it off.  i really am uncomfortable around him.  haha this picture with jack johnson is silly.  anyway, our group seemed so dedicated and excited in the beginning, but then we tried to do that rock in the park thing and it all fell apart.    i dont know when i started writing pictures, but i've only written six.  stupid me, i looked through my youth leader photo album and then my youth leadership bowie one.  too bad i had to work on that one, and i think i'm almost done with it now except for the captions.  but i really need to finish writing certain pictures for tomorrow, and its already one, and i'm exhausted.  haha maybe i really will sleep through baccalaureate tomorrow.

      i went to six graduation parties today and they were all awesome.  it was a day filled of fun and free food and lots of cake.  i had my car the whole day and my family wasnt home and all i did was party hop around bowie (plus adelphi).  first i went to erin's at 2.  there were a lot more people there than i expected.  melissa, michelle, tahira, kaitlyn, meghan, mc, melanie, amanda, and then leeann for like 5 minutes.  but it was nice.  i saw fr. perry and fr. tim, but probably the highlight was seeing kevin reagan.  he was in his priestly clothes and everything and its kinda weird.  i met him 4 years ago through jessie, and they were dating and that's how i knew him.  and then jessie told me that he's becoming a priest.  i mean, he'll be a great priest.  i cannot wait to go to his masses.  its still weird though.  and then another interesting thing that happened was that me and leeann were talking about how we were going to the same parties the rest of the day, and then right in front of me she turns to amanda and offers to take her around the whole day.  i just feel like leeann is completely changing.  she's distancing herself from the whole pius crowd, and i'm not the only one who feels that way.  i started to especially notice it (though i've seen it since juinor year when she ditched me and monica all the time) at the senior retreat when she didnt write any pius person a note.  morgan didnt get one either.  but amanda and ayanna did.  i understand that i've been close to her forever and i know how she feels about me, but it still hurt.  a lot.  everyone else took time to write each other notes...  she hurt me with the whole prom thing also.  i understand she has other friends, but i barely saw her the whole night.  she didnt go in our limo.  whatever.  but she didnt even act like she wanted to sleep over at monica's... she made up a stupid excuse not to go, and then erin even went with her to melissa's.  i didnt plan to talk about leeann this much. she's just really hurt me lately.  i mean, the people she's hanging out with now did not sit in taco bell (random place) for hours after school one day when we had tons of homework and just talk about how we could save leeann from her depression.  we were truly concerned and were willing to do anything for her.  the people she's with now were helping her stay depressed, unlike jackie, monica, and me.  i barely talk to her now.  and she hurt me today.  i dont know if i'm making too big of a deal of all of this, but she's hurt me a lot.  and i dont know how much i'm gonna keep in touch with her next year.  she acts like she doesnt want to stay in touch.  but anyway, back to erin's party.  i saw tiffany, and she said she's gonna bring gavin and kyra to my grandparents' house after graduation.  that's exciting!  i love those kids so much.  after erin's i went to ayanna's.  i saw leeann and amanda leaving on my way there.  they had said they were going to colleen's first.  but i guess they were on their way there.  at ayanna's, sarah norfolk was the only other person from seton there.  apparently i missed everyone else.  then morgan and matt came.  me and morgan were party buddies today - everyone else seemed to be planning together and meeting up at the same parties at the same time.  we were left out, but we had a great time together by ourselves.  i wasnt planning to go to colleen's, but ayanna gave me directions and i went.  morgan said it should only take about 20 minutes.  it was off 193, but when i got on adelphi road, i found a graveyard, and ayanna said to turn right in the middle of the graveyard.  i couldnt find it!  there was no road there.  so i called  colleen and she said that it would be a left (but she thought i was coming from the beltway), so i turned on this random road and went up and down it and i couldnt find heatherwood court.  i called her back and i was so lost.  i went up and down adelphi a couple times, and we finally figured out that ayanna had left out an important part of the directions: riggs road.  i finally made it to colleen's, and i saw theresa and kat and morgan and matt.  again, i apparently just missed leeann and amanda, as well as erin, sarah, melanie, and mc.  me and morgan had a nice chat.  we talked about leeann and how distant we felt from her recently and how much she's changed.  colleen's grandfather gave her a tv with a built in dvd player for graduation - that was nice of him.  she was so surprised and she set it up right away.  her cake was awesome.  that was random, but it was really the best cake i've had in a long time!  after colleen's i went to ben's house.  i was only planning to stay for like 10 minutes, but then kelly cahill was there!!  i love that girl so much.  i hope to see a lot of her this summer.  we talked for a while and i saw her prom pictures.  she said some of her friends took a fire truck to prom - that's crazy but awesome.  i went to becky's around 8:30.  i had some great indian food (like mint chicken!) and then there was this prayer service thing.  it was nice to experiene because church is such a huge part of becky's life. i think her whole church came to her party.  and then becky gave this speech.  it was so eloquent and inspirational.  i was planning to leave becky's around 9:15, but the prayer service started at 9 and didnt end til 9:40 and then i just started talking to erin and becky and becky's little cousins and friends from church.  they were all so cute and josh is my new friend who i'm probably never gonna see again in my life.  i think he was five and i wish he was my little brother.  i left becky's around 10:30 and got to monica's.  i called her house before i left and michelle picked up and said to come over because they had gotten out the guitars and were singing.  haha i thought she was joking.  however, as soon as i walked in the door, there was mark with his guitar singing some random song and everyone else was singing along.  monica looked so exhausted.  i felt bad i didnt get to her party earlier.  i wanted to be there for at least 2 hours, but i was only there til 12.  i talked to mrs. april and christy for a little bit.  christy and mark had gotten me a present, and frank had left a card for me.  i definitely did not expect any gifts or money from my folk group people.  but it was nice to know that they cared.  i really am gonna miss singing with them next year.  but i'll still have the christmas concert with them plus may and june.  then i looked at monica's memory books and it was nice to see all those random pictures, especially the "touch me" picture from taco bell and pictures from the last day of religion class sophomore year.  monica also had her prom pictures.  (oh yeah, i saw prom pictures on ayanna's camera, and i saw a picture of laurice, and she looked sooo beautiful.  sorry, that was random, but that picture stood out in my mind.)  i definitely want to get my prom pictures developed tomorrow.  i'm done with ritz because i cant afford it anymore.  goodbye white edges.  lol.  i'm gonna try eckerd because erin gave me this coupon for 50% off of 1 hour developing.  how nice.  so me and monica just talked for a while and then we realized it was midnight, and it was illegal for me to drive already, so i had to leave.  i love monica so much, and i love talking to her, especially when we're both tired.  we're sooo crazy!  and we laugh so hard because we're just too tired to do anything else.  its great.  i wish i could have stayed and talked to her more, but i didnt want to get in trouble.  i'm not afraid of the police, but i am afraid of my parents taking away the car.  i need the car - its my only way to get out of my house!  wow it's 1am and i really need to sleep.  tomorrow i really want to write senior pictures to people, but i think i have to clean a lot.  and i want to spend time with my sister's godfather cuz he's coming into town.  i'm so excited that he could come to my graduation.  it means a lot to me.  he's done so much for me, especially this year with notre dame.  i owe him soo much!  i need to sleep. woohoo, my dad just said tom's not getting in til 3ish, so i have plenty of time to sleep in, get film developed, clean, and take a nap outside all before "family time."  its all good.  i'm very grateful for this nice day.  it definitely made me happier.

      cassidy cracks me up.  and its funny because i'm almost her skin color, and i've never been this tan before in my life.  anyway, its actually not a big deal and i dont care to talk about it anymore, especially since the only reason i'm this tan is because i sit outside since i dont want to be inside my house.  so... prom.  i'm tired of people asking me how it was because i know they want me to say it was great and wonderful and magical and the best time of my life.  that is crap.  so i just tell people that it was fine and i'm too tired to talk about it, which i really am.  i only got like one hour of sleep total last night.  i think prom made me realize that i'm just not happy right now overall.  like, i can have fun and stay out of my house all i want, but at the end of the day, i still have to go home and deal with the crap i call my family.   i'm tired of something going wrong everyday.  i'm so emotionally drained and i feel like i dont know how to be happy anymore.  i mean, i'm definitely excited to go to notre dame and i cant wait.  that's what i'm living for right now.  i think i'm gonna start a countdown til aug 21, which is when my orientation is.  anyway.  prom.  i was never excited for prom.  i wasnt even gonna go til the end of this year when my friends not forced me into it but kept encouraging me to go.  all the time.  and jackie's been excited since like freshmen year, and everyday in advisory since april she's been talking about how excited she is.  so yesterday jackie had to do my hair and all she talked about was how happy and excited she was for prom, which i guess is understandable since it was the day of prom.  but i still wasnt excited.  after jackie did my hair i went to monica's.  i bought her a tiara because of that whole mess with prom court.  i was supposed to nominate her, but the last few weeks were sooo crazy and i was spazzing almost nonstop so i didnt get a chance to nominate her.  i was at her house for about a half hour, and then my mother called me at 5:10 saying that she couldnt drive me to allison's and i had to find my own way to get there because she had to take elizabeth to tiffany's.  we already went over the fact that tiffany offered to pick her up from my house.  but my mother caters to my sister, and she left me with 5 minutes to get a ride.  but first i had to get home and actually get ready.  as soon as i walked in the door my mother started yelling at me.  she was about to leave herself and i have no idea what she was even saying.  i couldnt get a hold of anyone going to allison's because they were all already on their way, so my sister's friends offered to drive me over.  why aleshia and cheryl were hanging around my house after my sister left i have no idea.  and why were they there at allison's instead of my family taking pictures of me?  my mother definitely knows how to ruin my day.  she's an expert at it actually.  i still owe allison's parents 86 bucks for the limo.  the free dinner was nice though.  we almost had to pay for some of it, but then brendan pulled out the gift certificate and it was for 80 dollars instead of 60, so we were fine.  i love wantons and sweet and sour chicken and everything else we ate.  the limo was nice but i was tired of allison freaking out.  i'm sorry her ex was gonna be at prom and we left dinner 20 minutes later than she wanted, but does not need to break down and complain every 5 seconds.  then we got to prom.  it was fine.  i was sad that there was no smoothie bar like at mcnamara's prom, but i didnt expect one.  seton is cheap.  i just wasnt in a dancing kind of mood.  it was nice to see people dressed up, but after a half hour, i was over it.    Aprilsshowerz:  i know. . .MEGAN MITCHELL! OH MY GOODNESS DID U SEE HER? haha april and i are talking about prom, and i mentioned what i said above and she definitely got excited anyway, i felt kind of bad that i wasnt happy and hyper and whatever, but i cant help that i'm not happy in this case.  i was ready for the after-prom stuff.  too bad we found out like an hour before we left that bowling was out because it ended at 1 and cost 17 dollars.  and people in my limo didnt want to go to ihop with everyone else.  we went to annapolis instead, which was not very fun for me at all because first of all, all the drunks were out yelling at us and hitting on us.  second of all, it was all couples except for me: allison and brendan, megan and mike, monica and ben, jackie and peter.  yes, jackie and me went to prom together, but erin, who had invited peter, had left prom with leeann to go to ihop instead of with us.  jackie's also close with peter.  they went out for like two weeks, but they're good friends or whatever.  so i walked around by myself.  now i was just ready to go back to monica's and eat and then sleep.  i loved how on the way home allison and brendan and megan and mike were making out the whole time and everyone else fell asleep.  oh well, it gave me time to think, mostly about family stuff.  the big shock of the night though was that mike did not touch me once.  mike murphy, who is the king of the touchy feely people and who molests me and "hug rapes" me (according to beth).  wow that was nice.  we actually had an intelligent conversation, showing me the side of him that got him into harvard.  (honestly, people who just hang out with him would never guess he's going to harvard next year).  but back at monica's it was still couples, because peter wasnt there but mike was, and mike and jackie went out for like 2 months this year.  whatever.   i got home today around 1pm and i went outside again because everyone had to be at my house.   it was really nice outside though - it was hot in the sun but there was a nice breeze.  i fell asleep and then woke up at 3:30.  that was good timing because i then had 15 minutes to get ready to sing at church.  i almost didnt go, but i'm so glad i did because i only have one or two masses left with the folk group.  also, it was just a nice mass.  it helped me clear my head, and we sang the best music.  (brought back a lot of memories of jessie).  i'm so excited for mass next year.  i hate going to mass with my family.    and why is pam dorsey IMing me?  i dont remember the last time i've talked to her, or actually, the last time she talked to me online voluntarily.  i saw her over christmas break with my sister, but i dont think she's ever IMed me before.  apparently my sister sent her prom pictures of me.  that's interesting.  so pam is telling me about notre dame and how i should be excited and how everybody there drinks.    tweetypd:  its just if u mind being around people who do drink that would be a problem  tweetypd:  like i know people who wont go to any parties if theres any alchohol at all, but at nd u really cant do that cuz every party people will eb drinking i'm glad she's not gonna be there this fall.  i want to meet people on my own, i dont want her to be there pressuring me to drink, and i dont want to hear about her "brain tumor."  from what i've heard she's making it all up.  i mean, who would study abroad for a semester in greece if you're getting chemo for a brain tumor?  is that the smartest thing to do?  i really needed to get this all out.  i needed to say out loud that prom sucked and it wasnt a milestone in my life or anything.  its over and i'm glad.  i'm ready to graduate and leave.  people were saying how they wanted to go to prom and just talk and be with people for the last time or whatever.  but honestly, i'm gonna stay in touch with the people i will want to see again, and i dont need a dance to make me stay in touch with people.  oh yeah, i'm really happy that leah is back home and everything is ok.  at least thats what she said.  i think i'm gonna call to make sure.  i'm so excited for her to move out with her dad in june (and also that she's going to uva in august) and for me to move to indiana in august.  and i think its funny because my mother thinks i'm coming home for thanksgiving - that's a joke.  if i come back to md i'm not going back to my house and i will be eating at someone else's house.  and that's all for now cuz i gotta go plan my day for tomorrow.  i have 5 or 6 graduation parties to go to.  at least i have the car and my family's not gonna be home at all!!

      WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING?  i definitely just spent 20 minutes writing and somehow it got deleted. and now that i've written it all, its gotten out of my system and i dont feel like rewriting it.  basically, i complained about my sister because she's acting so dumb and i cant take any more fighting in my house.  i sit outside enough as it is, and until i get a hammock, i dont plan on spending any more time outside than i already do (which is usually around 3 or more hours.  but honestly, if my house stays like it is, i'm contemplating just sitting outside forever.  i'll just never go inside unless i'm hungry, in which case i'll get food and bring it outside to my driveway, or i'm tired so i'll go to bed.  i played football at youth group tonight.  that was interesting.  i dont remember the last time i played football.  i do remember playing every week freshman and sophomore year though, until i got that concussion.  and then i got into that car accident and i was fed up with getting hurt all the time. i didnt want to risk getting even more injurred so i just stopped playing i guess.  i miss it but i dont.  i like being the best receiver out there though.  tommy asked me tonight if my brother was good enough to carry on the bradley tradition (first it was me, then my sister started playing football after she saw me be good, and now my brother started youth group tonight because it was 8th grade night).  i definitely said no, and sure enough, he didnt even play tonight.    anyway, my sister needs to get it together.  she cannot get all pissy every time she cant get the car.  there are four people who drive and only two cars.  PLUS she's had her license for what, 3 weeks.  and she's driven by herself like what, once?  she really is not in the position to be demanding a car to babysit, especially when my mother said she would drive her there and pick her up.  tiffany would always pick me up and brendan would take me home every time i babsat sophomore and most of junior year.  i'm sad i cant babysit tomorrow for gavin and kyra... i definitely almost said yes when tiffany asked, forgetting that prom was tomorrow.  haha, that shows how excited i am for it.  i'm really not though.  maybe once i get to allison's i'll be a little more excited about the actual dance.  for now, i'm only excited about the FREE dinner at grace's fortune and then bowling afterward.  i'm also excited about wearing flip flops to prom.  and me and jackie are both slackers so we're going out tomorrow afternoon to buy each other our flowers - she's buying me a boutonniere and i'm buying her a corsage with red roses.  i hope its not too expensive cuz i gotta get 86 bucks for the limo for allison tomorrow, plus 15 dollars for bowling.  and then apparently we need to bring food over to monica's.  since we have no food in my house, literally, i'll have to go out tomorrow and buy some.    on a random note, mark punched me hard tonight in the side and it hurt A LOT then and it still hurts now.  also, i hope leah is ok and feeling better tonight.  her brother is crazy, and then stupid dematha boys were joking about some of the stuff that her brother was referring to and that pissed me off.  boys need to watch what they say.  and i wouldnt be surprised if frannie and whoever else was there scared away all the 8th graders.   i'm tired and full (for the first time this week.  i need to make a list of what i need to do tomorrow and then i'm going to bed FRIDAY: make monica's prom surprise pack stuff for monica's and drop it off at her house make cookies for monica's? call grandma first thing in the morning get some kind of purse for prom  you know what, i dont even know what i need to do tomorrow, so i'm just gonna sleep and see what happens.  oh yeah!! i need to remember to call that lady about the babysitting job.  4 kids all under the age of 5 - that could be very interesting, but as long as it pays extremely well, i can handle it.

      what????!! this is so crazy.  i cannot believe leah's mother and brother - she does not need this stress in her life.  i'm glad she's not at home tho and i am definitely glad she's moving out with her dad soon.  even if she was gay, her brother should not hate her.  why can't parents trust their kids?  i like leah's dad.  he seems really nice and he actually trusts leah and wants her to be happy.  i cant write about this anymore, i just need to pray.  there will definitely be big prayers for strength and courage for leah tonight.

      so i went to jackie's tonight mostly to get out of my house and to hang out with her but also to figure out how i should do my hair for prom.  eating taco bell on her porch was nice, even though i got a mosquito bite.  that was annoying.  oh well.  jackie's legs are funny cuz she tried out some sunless tanning thing, and she said her legs were burned before, so this tanning thing just made her legs bright pink!  i'm glad she didnt rub the sunless crap all over.  that would have been funny though.  and we decided that i would get jackie the corsage for prom and she would get me a boutonniere cuz i dont feel like wearing some flower thing around my wrist the whole night.  honestly though, i'm not too excited about prom.  i'm not in the mood for a dance.  but i definitely cant wait for the FREE dinner at grace's fortune and then bowling and staying up all night.  that will be nice.  i hope there's a smoothie machine like at mcnamara's prom (haha that's a joke cuz seton is CHEAP.  the one thing i'm not too excited about (besides the actual dance) is mike being at monica's.  i dont hate him, but he really needs to not touch me at all.  i havent talked to him or seen him since january, and that's been nice actually.  i really think that after a semester at harvard next year he will get a lot more social skills and he'll be a lot less touchy feely and stuff.    one thing i'm really excited about though is this sunday because i've been invited to about 5 or 6 graduation parties, so i'm just gonna have the car the whole day and go from party to party all over bowie.  that will be a lot of fun, especially since i won't see my family the whole day.    i wish i could just get a new family.  my sister is all about bonding with my brother recently, which is fine, because i dont like living with my sister and my brother just annoys me and makes my headaches worse (and that is another story.  and then both my parents despise me.  i cannot wait to leave.  i'm so ready for college, especially notre dame!!  i'm really exhausted, but i need to stay up til 11:30 so i can call leah.  i want to talk to her and find out what's going on.  i'm definitely concerned about her  on a random note, i NEED to get in touch with jessie.  i dont know if she's even in the country.  she might still be in puerto rico.  i want her to go to graduation so badly... she helped me grow so much, especially freshman and sophomore year.  i love her to death and i want to see her.  i remember when i used to see her every other weekend, but the last two years i've seen her what, like two or three times total.  it's so crazy but i'm glad i kept in touch with her.  good old aol.  it made me sad to hear that katie and jessie lost touch.  they were so close two or three years ago.  aww senior night is in one week at youth group!  that will probably make me cry, unlike graduation.  i remember when we, the pius brats (according to elizabeth purnell haha, would go faithfully every single thursday from 7:30 to 10, and that's all we'd talk about at lunch.  and then juinor year we started going less and less, and i know i didnt go on any retreats that year.  i mean, youth group is still important to me, it helped make me who i am.  but i think becoming less attached to it senior year is important.  anyway, i hope they used good music for our slide show.  haha all the pictures are gonna be mine and i'm not gonna be in any of them.  i dont know if i'm gonna go on the retreat.  the last retreat in the fall was not a good spiritual experience, and this will probably be even less spiritual (if that's possible) because there are gonna be 2 or 3 other youth groups there. i'm really annoyed about that because this is my last retreat.  oh well, we'll see what happens.  i'll just focus on my excitement for our trip to the sarnelli house in philly.  as long as its not the sequal to last year's "becoming a maid," it'll be all good.  and i WILL NOT paint another room there purple or paint over the purple laundry room - that was crazy.  AND i'm not dusting with allison ever again cuz she made me get high off of pledge since she sprayed it in my face for like an hour - not a pleasant experience.   i think thats it.  i'll probably be back after i talk to leah.  i really like this blog thing.  it definitely helps me get everything out.  and yvonne is right, typing is a lot easier and faster than writing.  after like a week of this though i'll probably start writing a lot less

      there is no food in my house.  all we have is a huge box of goldfish, and i can only eat so much goldfish in one day.  i didnt even eat anything at the senior "picnic" because i had to run around selling books (thanks yvonne).  so all i've had today to eat is coffee, goldfish, and a graham cracker...  anyway, today was nice.  we really did not need to have a practice for baccalaureate... basically the gospel choir had a nice little rehearsal.  i was surprised that we actually got our yearbooks today, but i am still mad that i'm not gonna get my pictures back until midsummer.  i'm disappointed with the yearbooks though.  i was definitely expecting a lot more pictures of the senior class, especially from freshmen year.  i know i gave them a lot more pictures than that, and they only used like 5 pictures to fill one page of our yearbook.  overall i'm just not impressed and this insert we're getting better be GOOD.    mr. mccluskey surprised me a lot when he brought some of us in his room and shut the doors and then gave us books.  and he wrote nice notes in all of them.  i really appreciate him a lot.  he wrote me (and everyone else) a page-long note and it made me start to cry.  i've definitely enjoyed getting to know him, from jv volleyball to sophomore religion to senior religion - its all been great.  and its starting to hit me how much i'm going to miss seeing certain people everyday.  yvonne, for one.  i really do miss her already.  i know i've seen her, but i think just knowing that i'm not going to be seeing her as frequently makes me sad.  its weird but i've gotten closer to her this year than i have with other people over the last four years.  i appreciate her friendship a lot.  i always enjoy talking to her, and i have a lot of great memories with her from this year.  i'm definitely looking forward to frolicking with her at allen's pond.  how did that start anyway?  oh man i'm really going to miss her A LOT!!  i just hope she's gonna be able to come visit me next year at ND - she's been so supportive of me going to ND and i feel bad that she cant go herself. and yvonne, i agree that high school SUCKED, but i still made some great friends during high school (you for one)  then there's best friend #2.  i wrote her such a long note last night.. its kinda weird how we became close.  i just know i love her a lot and i'm gonna miss her a lot also.  and she started crying in the cafeteria when she was signing my yearbook.  i hate seeing people cry cuz it makes me start to tear up.  monica's note made me cry too.  she's always been there for me, even when my family and the rest of my friends havent.  and then last year was so crazy.  seriously, me and monica were definitely excluded from everyone at pius.  leeann was with matt, morgan and jackie were also in that circle, and jackie and sarah were close, and i think that's how erin became part of that crowd too.  so that's when me and monica started to have playdates.  hahaha those are some good memories.  anyway, i've never known monica to be extrememly sensitive or sentimental, and i did not expect her note to be so long or anything.  but she was talking about how i was her best friend and how much she appreciates me and how sad she is that i'm leaving her next year but at the same time she's so excited cuz i'm going where i want to go.  monica's been so supportive of me, and i love her so much.    and leah... she looked so upset when i saw her today.  i hate that she's going through family crap and that she's having problems with stupid friends.  brittiany told me that she ran away last night.. leah said she'd call me today to talk, so i hope she does.  all i know to do is pray for her.  i cant imagine what happened last night at her house, but i know its not good at all.  i just wish her parents would stop being so immature and petty.  leah deserves better than that

      i shouldnt have used this as my journal.  but my parents go in my room, especially my mother, and read my stuff.  i'm beating myself up over the fact that i've written such personal stuff in here.  its online and open to the world and i should have known better.  i just needed to write.  i needed to vent and express myself and reflect on my life.  i used to do that before i went to bed and i'd pray and everything, but now i either fall asleep as soon as i get in bed or my head hurts too much to seriously think about my life.    habitat is tomorrow.  i'm excited, but i think i'll be more excited once we're in the pius parking lot at 12:30 and we're all getting ready to go.  i havent packed at all yet.  my laundry is still being dried.    i wish i could have talked to yvonne tonight.  maybe i should have called earlier.  i wanted to see laurice today too, but that didnt work out cuz i was shopping with monica for habitat and stuff for a couple hours.  i really hope yvonne is ok.  i need to see her.  i say this all the time but i really miss her... when i see her i'm gonna do something very nice for her.  i dont know what yet, but i want her to have a good day.  and if she has one, i will too.  i think we both need a stress-free day.  i dont remember the last time that happened for me...  back to the whole journal thing, i was thinking while driving to jackie's tonight.  i wouldnt care if beth were the only person reading this.  but everyone who reads beth's blog is able to get this address.  and i dont like that.  i dont want to think about what i can/cannot write.  i want to write freely and get everything off my chest.  some things just need to be said once.  its not like i want to trash everyone and i want to hurt everyone, but i just need to express how i'm feeling at that moment and be done with it.  i hope people can forgive me.  i just want to move away and start a different part of my life.  a happier and less stressful part of my life.   i got an email from leah today!!  i sent her one a couple weeks ago, and i was beginning to wonder if she changed her email address or something.  i'm glad she seems to be doing better.  i hope things are good with her friends.  when i get back from habitat, i'm gonna make a much bigger effort to hang out with people that i miss.  i spent june working and hanging out with pius people and going to the pool.  i still want to do all that, but i definitely want to see people like beth, kadie, leah, a lot laurice more.  one thing that made me sad today was that camille smokes.  her voice is soo pretty and i dont want her to mess it up... but its her choice in the end.    i dont even know what to write about anymore.  i have plenty of stuff to say, but i'm paranoid.  i'll pray and cry about it tonight i'm sure.  i'm soooooo ready for habitat and the beautiful chapel and mass everyday. no more maid training 101 or mtv's becoming a maid or "made" into a maid.  haha no more weeding the cracks in the sidewalks!    its midnight and i really should get packing.  i dont even know what i need to bring.  whatever.  i'm done for now

      shiiiiiiittttt!  i didnt realize that when i posted a comment on beth's blog that it posted my blog's address.  i've been using this to write everything.  i think i've written some not so nice things about specific people and named them and i dont want them to read what i said about them when i was upset/mad.  i hope they know if they read this that i love them.  but i know they'll take it personally because i know i have taken it personally when i've read stuff about myself in other people's journals.  i dont want to delete all of those entries tho because they are a part of my life.  we were just talking about that today at allen's pond.  how we shouldnt post people's business or whatever on journals.  i thought i was ok because i hadnt given out this address.  i'm stupid.  its not that i dont want people to know about my life, and i think i would have given it out eventually.  i think what it comes down to at the end of the day is that i'm not happy and there are a lot of things i dont like about myself or my life.  i'm super stressed and i just needed a way to vent, which was this blog.  but now i feel like i have to hold back and i dont like that.  i dont know what i'm gonna do.  maybe God wanted me to post on beth's blog to get my life out in the open.  i dont know.  i have so many secrets. well not really.  but a couple big ones.  and i'm scared to open up to someone about them.  i'm scared for people to know certain sides of me because i'm afraid they'll look at me differently and wont like me or whatever.    for now, i'm worried about yvonne.  i tried calling her earlier, but she didnt pick up.  i dont want her to be depressed, but i feel useless also.  i know megan would make her happy.  i dont know what to say.  all i can do for now is just to be there for her and pray for her.  anyway, i went to sacred heart mass today... music was HORRIBLE!  i did see anne abeta though so that was nice.  so father perry is a monsignor now.. i dont know how i feel about that one.  and he kept saying how he still wanted the parish, his 'family,' to call him father.  yeah right.  shit i really have to think.  there has to be a reason why this happened, but i feel like i messed up and i dont know what to do

      wow.  today was nice.  i've been out from 4pm til 2am and its been great.  i was definitely looking forward to jackie's party, especially because she said laurice and devonne were gonna be there.  i was told they'd be there from like 4 to 6:30, so i made sure i was there by 4:30.  too bad they didnt come.  i was really upset, i wanted to see laurice so badly.  but i'll call her tomorrow and see if i can drop by her house so i can give her my graduation present for her and to talk for a while.  anyway, seeing a bunch of people from seton, like colleen, beth, and amanda, was very nice.  i've been a little tired/annoyed with the pius people, except for monica, and i've really missed some seton people.  i want to call kadie, leah, laurice, sam, and a couple others and find a time to hang out with them.  i miss yvonne most of all, but again, talking to her last night made me more than happy and i know we'll hang out soon.  i'm still praying for her and megan.  anyway, jackie's party was fun.  nothing really exciting happened, but it was just nice to talk to people and hang out.  i played cards with theresa for like an hour and a half.  she told me laura sickles broke up with that guy (but is she still sleeping with him?) and she moved back home.  i dont know if i even care anymore...after the summer after she graduated, she didnt seem to want to talk to me anymore.  she seemed like she was just really busy at the time, but now she makes no effort to talk to me, even when i randomly see her, like at the band/choral concert.  so i dont know.  oh yeah, the best part of jackie's party was when she got out her guitar and beth played float on, socco amaretto lime, and hear you me!!  we sang along to the last two, and allison recorded it onto my voicenotes on my cell phone.  :)  i love our little guitar parties.  i missed megan though.    at jackie's, colleen started talking about going bowling around 10:30.  i was excited about that because we were supposed to go bowling after prom, but that got cancelled since it was only open til 1 and we werent gonna get there til 1.  tonight it was open til 2, and we planned to get there at 11.  then colleen said they were gonna pick up marissa! i love that girl, and she will visit me with sam next year and they will both go to notre dame with me!!  that would be awesome.  it was very very nice to hang out and talk with marissa for 3 hours.  amanda, matt, colleen, ayanna, marissa and her cousin, and meghan all went bowling.  amanda and meghan didnt bowl.  and amanda was all over matt.  they flirt a lot (reminded me of taco bell and "touch me, touch me!" acted out for jackie by me and monica).  like amanda sat on his lap and i saw her kiss him and they're just very flirty.  if morgan and matt break up and then he goes out with amanda, i would not be surprised at all.  i mean, it wouldnt be good, especially since he did that with leeann to go out with morgan last year, but i wouldnt be surprised.  why doesnt morgan care that amanda and matt flirt with each other 24/7.  maybe they have a threesome thing going, i dont know.  but bowling was a lot of fun.  i took some funny pictures, and matt broke his lane.  that was hilarious.  matt is a really nice guy actually.  i went to pius with him for 8 years, and then he went out with leeann.  but that was the year monica and i were excluded because of that little clique, so i didnt get the best impression of him.  and he hurt leeann so much... but he is really nice and he went out of his way to make sure i was able to go bowling since i couldnt drive after midnight.  overall bowling was a lot of fun.  haha but when we got there, we were like the only white kids in there, and everyone stared at us.  it was funny.  and they played rap/hip hop/r&b the whole time.  i didnt mind, i liked most of it.    july 9th is no way josie's last show!!  i'm looking forward to it a lot, but its also sad.  i'm gonna make a no way josie shirt and put a picture of them on it and then have them all sign it.  i love their songs and i love beth and megan.    i'm so tired but now that i'm up i want to watch boy meets world at 3.  tomorrow i need to: call mrs. mccorkle to get paid and find out if i still have a job call jackie to pick up cds i want to burn and pick up jeans, ask if we're still seeing 'saved' before habitat monday morning call kelly cahill to see if she has old jeans she doesnt want call laurice to see if i can drop by call pius people - are we going habitat shopping and are we meeting at allen's pond buy film and battery for blue camera, charge battery for digital camera, get extra batteries for it, and pack the digital camera with my habitat stuff.  it takes a lot better pictures than that fugifilm blue camera... PACK FOR HABITAT!! write rest of thank you notes, give them to dad to send out on monday buy notebook or something for habitat.  i need it to take notes on "the vanishing voter" plus to write down some revelations or insights or something i hope to have.  i'm getting used to reflecting on my days because of this blog.  its funny because last year i had to write a journal to get my service hours to count and i didnt want to.  it ended up being helpful and fine, but this year i actually want to bring a journal thing.    i cant think of anything else i really need to do.  i guess i want to exercise if possible.  i also want coffee.  hot coffee because my throat is killing me.  i cant be sick in philadelphia.    i cant decide what mass to go to.  i would love to go to 9am.  maybe jessie would be there.  hopefully.  but i'm pretty sure my dad is planning on going to 10.  i dont want to at all.  i'm done with sacred heart.  for real.

      but first, let me express how excited i was to call yvonne and she was home and we talked for about 45 minutes.  she made me laugh for the first time all day, and i am in a much better mood.   "so what's going on with you?" -yvonne "my brother broke my finger" -me "thats when you beat his ass" -yvonne i'm still upset about my hair, but i'll get to that later.   i love hearing all these stories that end with yvonne being embarrassed.  from her hair falling out to playing gameboy at work to running to the bus in heels... its all great and definitely made me laugh.  next time i talk to her, i should tell her the new cds i got (alicia keys, jay-z, kanye west...).  i can hear her laughing now.  i'm sad she cant go to jackie's party tomorrow, but i will definitely be calling her sunday to talk, maybe hang out cuz habitat is monday!!  i am excited about that actually.  i'm ready to leave my house for a week.  anyway, because i talked to yvonne, i can go to bed smiling.  too bad she told me she wont do my summer work for me.  and she gets $300 for one week of work!  can i get a regular job??   my dad told me today that they're moving my bed and everything into my sister's room while i'm in pennsylvania.  i've been stalling as long as i can, but i cant really do anything about it since i'm gonna be gone for a week.  that's gonna suck, but whatever.  habitat is in 2 days!!  and it would be awesome to see saved that morning!!  i'm excited to run with leeann every day and pray in the chapel and eat chupa chupes (or whatever they're called), sugar free icy pops, and special extra dark (aka burnt) pretzels and have late night talks outside and help the homeless and NOT clean or be a part of maid training 101.  it will be an amazing 5 days.    bug juice at 11.  wait its not on!!  :(  i ran every day this week.  i'm very proud of myself.  in july, i want to run every day and swim laps at the pool 5 days a week.  i desperately want to get in shape.  i'm worried about my eating habits though.  this week i was getting up at 6am and wouldnt eat til 4pm.  and i stop eating at like 9pm just because i dont like eating late at night unless i'm out or something.  its ridiculous.  i was so used to going to bed at 3am and not waking up til 12ish, so i wouldnt be hungry til 3pm.... and that carried over into this week.  maybe its subconscious.  gaining weight is an issue for me i know.  i also know i'm not fat.  but i'm not the skinny, tiny (and i mean really skinny and tiny) girl i was sophomore year.  i'm trying to be ok with it.  but every time i think i am, my mother makes some comment about me being fat and stuff.  she's been saying that crap since 8th grade... i've never been fat in my life.  i'm not even trying to lose weight right now, which is nice, and i'm proud of myself.  i just want to get in shape and build up my muscles.  but i do worry about it all.    i need a new pair of jeans.  tomorrow i want to wake up around 10, burn cds for jackie, mow the lawn, make laurice's  present (which i should start tonight), lay outside, go to old navy and buy jeans, then go to jackie's at 4 and party all day.  she said i can stay til whenever, which is 11:50 for me.    i think i've decided that i like ashlee simpson.  i dont know why.  i do like her songs that i've heard so far, especially 'unreachable.'  i'm glad megan likes her too.  she likes freaky friday with me also.  haha.    so i had a horrible hair cut experience today.  i literally cried for an hour and a half at least when i got home (but i think that partly had to do with me being exhausted and spent and emotionally drained.  anyway, i hate hair cuttery, but thats where i always go because its cheap.  however, when i went in february this year, the hair cut was fine, and this time i wanted the exact same thing done.  i wanted to get it cut 2 inches and with one layer in the back.  too bad this lady took an hour and half to do whatever shit she was doing with my hair, and i knew she was doing something wrong because it took so long.  i got home and looked in the mirror, and this lady had made like 10 layers in the back and on the side, plus she cut it waaaayy too short.  my hair is still long, but it took 2 years to get it to a nice length and she ruined it.  the only way to fix what she did is to just cut 5 more inches off to even it all out.  but i cant do that, i want my hair long.  i'm so pissed off still.  i put my hair up as soon as i got home.  i cant even look at it or i'll start crying.  i'm so emotional today.  i didnt even go out with leeann and erin tonight because i was so upset.  but it turned out to be a good night because i talked to yvonne.  i was kinda nervous to call her just because i hadnt seen her since graduation and i hadnt talked to her online in a while.  but i'm so glad i called her.  i love her to death, and i love how she hung up on this girl rachel twice.  i was surprised she passed up two phone conversations on her cell to continue to talk to me.  then megan called, but i know they're having some issues so i didnt mind that yvonne left to talk to megan.  i was glad megan called her... yvonne sounded so frustrated and annoyed since megan hadnt called her and she didnt know where she was.  i worry about yvonne and megan.  i just want yvonne to be happy - she deserves to be happy.  and i know megan can make her so happy, but they seem to have more bad days than good.  i know everything's not gonna be perfect in a relationship.  however, i've seen how much hurt megan has caused yvonne.  to me, it doesnt seem worth it, but i also know how much yvonne loves megan.  i dont know whats going to happen with them, but whatever happens, it will work out for the best.  as cheesy as that sounds, its true.    right now i'm talking to leeann and trying to make laurice's present.  its a blank picture frame right now.  i need to write stuff on top and on the sides, plus think of something small to buy her.   memories with laurice: her roses dance, ballet, dancing to tootsie roll before volleyball games sophomore year, sophomore year religion... i really just started getting to know her this year.  when we played volleyball together, i dont know why but i thought she didnt like me.  same with stephanie.  but i got along with both of them great this year.    i dont know, i'll do it tomorrow.  i g2g to bed.  i'm exhausted....

      i saw the pius people at youth group tonight.  all of them.  allison, erin, jackie, leeann, monica.  it was weird for all 6 of us to be together.  it was also nice for a hot minute.  then allison started bawling, jackie had her usual high-pitched voice and she was completely happy, erin was complaining, leeann was great and liked the 'pretty' bruise on my finger.  i love allison, but i'm tired of her.  i honestly cannot think of the last time i talked to her when she was not crying, whining, or complaining.  like the world is all about her.  not that its all about me or anything, but honestly, there are people with much bigger problems than her. ever since i met her in 6th grade or whatever, she's been crying.  at every stupid middle school dance, she caused the drama and she was the reason why we spent the dances in the bathroom.  at first i was excited to spend an hour with monica, jackie, erin, allison, and leeann at allen's pond on sunday.  but now i feel like its just gonna be a complaining/venting session for allison.  plus, erin and jackie are already so defensive about their beach trip thing.  whatever.  i dont even want to deal with it.  i just wish we could have a nice hour enjoying each other's company  float on.  (my song of the day)  woohoo!! tomorrow's my last day with this family, and i'm only babysitting them while they're at the pool, so basically i'm getting paid to get a tan :) :) :)  AND i'm getting paid tomorrow.  over $200.  tomorrow should be a nice day because i get to sleep in til 8, i'm running and showering, then taking the girls to the pool.  i think we're gonna stay til 2:30 so i have time to shower before i go get my hair cut with monica.  i'm supposed to go to matt capiece's baseball game with leeann and erin tomorrow too.  we'll see if that works out.  i need to buy jeans and make laurice's graduation present since she'll be out jackie's bday/grad party.  oh yeah i need to burn some cds for jackie!  and i need to call yvonne tomorrrow or talk to her online.  i'm inviting her to jackie's party.  i have no idea if she'll be able to go but i hope so.  i will seriously drive all the way out there to pick her up and back to drop her off just to see her. i will even buy her teddy grahams for the road.  i just want to talk to her and spend time with her.  more than anything at this point.    in other news, mary-kate olsen is anorexic and getting help.  i dont normally care about stuff like this, but its nice that her friends and family care about her so much and want to help her.  she's lucky.  makes me wonder yet again why my family doesnt.    this weekend: call mrs. mccorkle - i need my money and i need to know if i need to find a new job buy jeans go shopping for habitat go to allen's pond with pius people sunday afternoon make laurice's grad present call yvonne jackie's grad party saturday, 4 to whenever pack for habitat plan seeing saved monday morning mow the lawn exercise buy some more clothes since i'm running with leeann in philly  thats it for now i guess.  gonna eat some pudding and watch the rest of boy meets world then going to bed.    yknotsmyle:  i gtg do laundry but i just wanted to say that i'm glad we're all gonna talk on sunday cause i think everyone just needs to talk and i am going to miss you very very very much next year but i'm Very happy you're going somewhere where you will be happy and i will definitely take caravan road trips out to see you even if i hafta borrow devonne's car to do it  jackie keeps saying she's gonna come see me next year.  i hope i'm not disappointed...

      but its all good, sort of, since i got 4 cds today (usher 8701, alicia keys diary of alicia keys, jay-z the black album, and switchoot.  yes i can hear yvonne laughing even louder) - that makes me extremely happy.  i've wanted the alicia keys cd since it came out, i got the usher cd for free... i love music soo much.  it lets me escape my life.  i dont even care that i spent $40.  actually, getting 4 cds for $40 isnt bad at all.  i'm so excited to open the switchfoot cd and listen to "twentyfour."  havent been able to listen to that song since my brother somehow scratched my cd.    "Life is not what I thought it was  Twenty-four hours ago  Still I'm singing 'Spirit,  take me up in arms with You'  And I'm not who I thought I was  Twenty-four hours ago  Still I'm singing 'Spirit,  take me up in arms with You"  you know, everytime i read yvonne's blog, i am just amazed.  she is hilarious, but she is so intelligent and has such a way with words.  i cant even describe how intelligent she is.    i basically picked my classes for first semester today.  my first choices are: university seminar psychology (and pass out of comp101 i hope!!), theology 100, calculus 119, principles of physics 1, pe (i wish i could take gymnastics, but i dont think they have it and i'm not exactly sure how picking the actual pe class works but i'm so excited to take the class!!), and italian 101.  i cannot describe my feelings about next year.  i'm so excited to be happy.  all the time.  i cant wait to move out.  i just cannot wait for the whole experience!!     bug juice at 11, how exciting!  except 13 and 14 year old girls are so silly  work was interesting today... i like how i'm supposed to be working from 8 til 4, but the two days that i've been working for this family, i've been there til 5.  or 5:30.  or whenever.  i dont get it.  i think i should be paid extra for overtime.  and mrs. mccorkle STILL hasnt called me back?  does she want me to work for her or not?  i dont know what would happen if i stop working for her though.  i need some way to make money during july.  july's gonna be a nice monica.  i'm working about 15 hours a week as far as i know, but me and monica are going to go to the pool whenever we can.  its very nice and relaxing.    i really need to go to bed.  i want to run tomorrow morning, especially since i didnt run today.  i heard my alarm at 6, and next thing i knew, it was 6:30, which was too late for me to run.  so tomorrow i definitely want to run at least a mile and a half.  i want to do some situps too.  i cant do pushups though cuz of my stupid finger.  i think i slept on it last night.. it hurts a lot.  i'm so mad its broken.  i miss volleyball a lot.  it sucks that i cant play with becky this summer.  at least the first half of it.  i hope my finger wont affect what i can do in philly.  we'll see i guess.  i'm talking about nothing so i'm gonna stop now.  i wish i wrote more like yvonne.  maybe that's something to strive for with this blog.

      i'm glad i talked to morgan.  she gives good advice.  much better than stupid doctors who dont know anything.  i waited for 2 hours just to have him give me bad advice.  go figure.  DrgonFae:  hey TicoFlower:  heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey-loooo! DrgonFae:  how was your father's day? TicoFlower:  actually it turned out alright... nothing really happened until 4, then my sister came over and we had lobster and shrimp, then we played poker with real money!!!  lol just nickels and dimes and quarters oh my! but it was fun  DrgonFae:  lol did you win a lot of change?> TicoFlower:  no.. i lost change, but it was my dad's change, so its all good!! DrgonFae:  lol TicoFlower:  we have a big cup DrgonFae:  sounds like a nice day TicoFlower:  and so mer gave my dad ten dollars and we gave her and alan each 5 dol in change, then my dad and i just too 5 dol each out of it TicoFlower:  so i mean they ended up winning like 3 dollars, and then whatever was left we put back in the jar TicoFlower:  how was ur day DrgonFae:  i didnt really do anything.  my dad wasnt home - he went to my grandparents house.  so i went to church, watched tv, took a nap, ran a few errands, and then came back and watched some more tv DrgonFae:  i havent really had a lot of energy the last few days TicoFlower:  Yea, does ur finger hurt DrgonFae:  not if its just sitting there, but when i bend it or touch it it does DrgonFae:  but i can bend it all the way down almost like a normal finger, although it hurts TicoFlower:  same, that is how mine was!! We're broken finger twins!!  either that, or we are telepathicl-ly connected my our fingers TicoFlower:  so is it broken? TicoFlower:  *by not my DrgonFae:  yeah its broken in two places DrgonFae:  lol we're broken finger twins AND telepathicl-ly connected TicoFlower:  AWESOME!! DrgonFae:  did you have to get physical therapy for your finger? TicoFlower:  no, and if they tell u that you do, they are lying TicoFlower:  dont do it TicoFlower:  they say you should, bc its ur finger TicoFlower:  and well, u use it all the time TicoFlower:  but AFTER its healed TicoFlower:  you will easilly be able to get movement back DrgonFae:  yeah they said i should.  and my dad said so too TicoFlower:  so dont take the time to go to therapy,. that is what the emergency doctor told me, then i talked to another doctor we met in florida, and mine, and he said you really dont need it DrgonFae:  i dont want to do it DrgonFae:  cool DrgonFae:  i mean, i can move it around on my own TicoFlower:  once its healed, all you do is use it and like when you are sitting still keep trying to move it TicoFlower:  you really DONT need thereapy TicoFlower:  *Therapy TicoFlower:  but dont try to move it while its broken TicoFlower:  so it will heal faster TicoFlower:  i had no problem, took me about a week to a week and half to feel like i was fully using it again DrgonFae:  wait i shouldnt move it at all? TicoFlower:  becuase at first i still had a phoebia to use it... bc ididnt want it to hurt TicoFlower:  not while its broken TicoFlower:  give it like 2 weeks DrgonFae:  the doctor told me to take off the splint a couple times a day to move it TicoFlower:  whaaaaaaaaaat DrgonFae:  oh those silly walk-in doctors TicoFlower:  i mean i guess u can DrgonFae:  lol TicoFlower:  but like, it has to stay still to heal TicoFlower:  that is why ur body makes it so it hurts when u move it, so that you DONT TicoFlower:  at least wait another week before u start doing that.. u will be fine DrgonFae:  that's why i HATE doctors DrgonFae:  they're so stupid to me TicoFlower:  and u def DONT need therapy... like after 2.5-3 weeks it will heal and you can just get a squishy ball and squeeze it and stuff TicoFlower:  u dont need to go through the pain of bending it now DrgonFae:  oooo i like squishy balls TicoFlower:  becuase i didnt move mine at ALL for over 3 weeks, which is more than necessary, and its completely normal now.. i wanted to make sure it healed right first though before i moved it becuase i mean... it is my FINGER, i use it all the time, so it probably took me longer to get it moving again DrgonFae:  hmmm DrgonFae:  maybe walk-in doctors just dont know what they're talking about DrgonFae:  well, i trust you, so now i'm gonna keep the splint on all the time DrgonFae:  i'm glad i talked to you about this TicoFlower:  i mean u dont need to go through the pain of moving it so dont!! lol TicoFlower:  i dont like pain personaly DrgonFae:  i dont either TicoFlower:  what are you up to tommorow DrgonFae:  babysitting from 8 to 4 DrgonFae:  should be fun TicoFlower:  gotchaaaa DrgonFae:  what about you?

      so i guess mrs. mccorkle doesnt care if i work or not this week.  its sunday night and i've been trying to get in touch with her since friday afternoon.  i know i was supposed to call her friday morning, but it definitely was not my fault that i was in like 5 different doctors' offices.  i bet she'll call at 10 tomorrow morning and ask if i can work at 3 in the afternoon.  too bad i wont be able to.  its her own fault.  i STILL need to get paid.  oh well, i'm happy to babysit for this new family for this week starting tomorrow.  two girls, 1 6 years old and 1 11 years old.  that'll be much nicer than the other family.  plus i get $6 an hour.  its more than minimum wage, and i really doubt i'll have to do too much.  i really cant do that much anyway because of my finger.  i hope they will want to stay at the pool after their swimming lessons.  this will be a great week if they like the pool.  :)  i ended up going to sacred heart mass against my will.  i'm actually glad i went.  the folk group did sing, i think it was their last week.  but they sounded horrible.  there were only 3 singers, and the soprano couldnt hit any of the high notes.  so the music wasnt good, but i actually enjoyed fr. perry's homily.  thats a first.  normally he just preaches about what we should wear to church and how babies shouldnt cry and how people shouldnt leave early or whatever.  actually, enjoyed isnt really the word.  i could relate to it though.  he talked about how prayer is such a hard thing.  its the "holy cross we have to bear daily."  its been really hard for me lately.  i remember i used to pray every single night no matter what and i loved every minute of it.  i mean, i like prayer and all.  i pray for other people every day, but i dont pray like i used to.  i was starting to get better about it but then that whole confession thing happened.  i think habitat really will help, and i'll get through the summer and it will be all good at notre dame.  back to mass, mrs. kerley was sitting behind me!  i didnt even notice until right before communion.  she saw my broken finger and i know she was thinking in my head that i get hurt all the time and she would expect something like this to happen to me.  i dont like that woman at all.  when michelle walked by mrs. kerley's row i thought it was funny how she didnt even smile at mrs. kerley or anything.  the april family despises that lady, but michelle seemed to like her during volleyball at seton.  haha the whole volleyball team pretends to like her just to stay on her good side.  anyway, i wasnt happy to see her.  why was she at sacred heart?  i dont think i'm going back there this summer so i guess it really doesnt matter.  i was so happy to see anne abeta after church though.  i was glad i went juse to talk to her for 5 minutes.  she's so sweet.  i've only known her for 2 or 3 years, but she's extremely supportive of me.  when i told her i got into notre dame, cuz i hadnt talked to her in a month or so, she was so excited and gave me a huge hug.  she is so much happier for me than my family ever was or will be.  then she told me she wants to take me out to lunch sometime soon.  now i actually hope i can go to that holy hour/happy hour thing on tuesday just to see her.  i'm gonna miss her.    today i really didnt do anything.  i cleaned up a little downstairs.  i took a nap.  i dropped off the boxers i bought for monica and talked to her for 15 minutes or so.  that house is so funny, and i know monica and her mom arent amazingly close, but they do have a nice relationship.  mrs. april is like my second mom.  i think i talk to her more than my mother.  oh yeah, i tried calling calling mrs. mccorkle 10 times today.  at one point, i tried calling every half hour.  and then i just gave up.    i dont think i did anything else.  i needed a day to do nothing.  i have no energy left.  didnt talk to my mother today.  lately our 'relationship' if you'd even call it that has been: she yells at me and spends the whole day cutting me down and crap, and then i just ignore her for a couple days.  and then it starts all over again.  i dont know how much longer i can ignore her.  i try to not let it hurt.   so yvonne just got on and i was reading jackie's journal and sending an excerpt of it to monica really quick, and then she puts up an away message saying she doesnt feel like talking.  but i want to talk to her so badly!  anyway, now i'm talking to leeann for the first time since she sent me that IM making me feel bad about feeling excluded.  cuz apparently SHE'S never excluded me.  lets see what monica and i say about that one.  whatever.    dont have too much to say.  probably will later after talking to a couple people

      so i really should go to bed.  i'm exhausted and i cant sleep in because i have to go to sacred heart mass tomorrow.  i dont know how i feel about.  if the folk group is singing and there are good songs, then i'll be ok.  if not, i would prefer not to go, or to at least go to st. pius...  did i mention i havent gotten paid yet???  and i tried calling mrs. mccorkle five times today and left 2 messages and i still couldnt get a hold of her.  i need to know when i'm working next week cuz i gotta work out my schedule with the other family.    i think its funny how i went to target and bought monica's father's day present for her today and i havent even bought my own father anything.  i forgot it was father's day tomorrow.  i dont like celebrating family-type days.  like today, we went out to dinner for my mother's birthday, which was over a week ago.  and almost everyone who knows me knows that i would despise celebrating anything for my mother.  thank goodness it was a buffet style chinese place and we were only there for 25 minutes.  plus i fell asleep on the way there and the way back - that was nice.    "i never thought i'd die alone.  i laughed the loudest, who'd have known." - adam's song  i'm really mad at myself for forgetting about mc's graduation party.  i remembered at 8 because everyone from seton on my buddy list had something up about going to it.  i knew it was at new carrollton pool and i could have made it and stayed for an hour and a half, but i have no clue where that pool is and no  one picked up their cell phone.  well, becky called me back while she was at church.  i felt kind of bad.  she told me they won their volleyball game yesterday.  i'm extremely pissed that i couldnt play last night and i probably wont be able to play the rest of the summer :'(   but what i really dont understand is that if my finger is broken in 2 places, how come i basically have full range of motion??  i can bend it almost all the way down, if i push it, and it can go the other way as far back as the other fingers.  however, my finger is still really swollen and black and blue and several other colors.  it does hurt a lot too.  i really would love to be happy for just one day.  i need some motivation to survive this summer.  i'm hoping habitat will give me that.  but its gonna be a bunch of cliques so maybe not.  sarah and dana.  jackie, erin, annie, leeann.  jackie, robbie, mark, erin.  me, monica, ben kaitlyn.  well, kaitlyn will probably be with everyone, but there's 4 people who will always want to play euchre, and that's the second group.  when did my pius group become like this?  when erin and jackie decided to go on their beach trip without including anyone else and then invited allison and probably leeann, and also when jackie became best friends with everyone under the sun.    "ben thinks jackie's such a geek" -monica  she's definitely not normal in my opinion.  NO ONE IS HAPPY ALL THE TIME.  but yeah, jackie and leeann.  jackie and allison.  jackie and erin.  they're all probably wives by now.  lets stop the craziness.  and i also like how none of my pius friends have attempted to communicate with me or monica.  and thats the end of that.   i did not see any of this coming.    i did something really random today.  i bought kanye west's cd.  i can hear yvonne laughing at me from texas.  or is she home now?  i'm not sure.  but if she were in texas i know i could hear her laughing.  i had a borders gift certificate and i decided i was gonna use it to buy cds that i normally wouldnt buy, either because they are too expensive, or i dont know if i'll love it.  i dont want books right now.  i have too many cds i want to buy  i havent listened to my usher or outkast cds in a week or two.  i think i'm gonna do that tomorrow because i like them a lot.    i just got an IM.  if its jackie telling me to be happy, i'll be pissed.  and it is!  i'm so psychic.  she told me that she "hopes my nite gets better."  its not just a night!  and she would know that if she had talked to me in the last few weeks..    i like morgan's away message.  she has it up all the time, but it just hit me tonight that i can really relate to it: "A real frend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out." Walter Winchell  its so true.  i need a really good laugh to take my mind off all this physical pain.  some nice episodes of newlyweds would be great.  i feel so smart after watching that show.  maybe i should take a lot of medication too.  i just realized i havent taken anything since i broke my finger. that probably wasnt smart.  why are all the bouncing souls cds so expensive?  i cannot pay $15 per cd.  thats ridiculous  i really want to just lay down and watch tv. but i cant do that til my dad goes to bed.  why cant he go to sleep?  isnt he tired? i know i am and i dont even know what i'm saying anymore.  i dont think i'm saying anything at all.  goodnight.  to no one since no one has this website

      i honestly cant deal living in my house right now. i have to deal with so much other crap, like my broken finger (its really hard to only type with one hand) and headaches and then problems with my close friends.  so i go out and have problems and i come home and i have even worse problems.  i really thought i'd be able to ignore it all.  but the last two days have been really hard for me.  i hate doctors and waiting rooms and all of it.  today i had to get up at 6:45 just to wait in the waiting room for 2 hours before i even saw a doctor.  and all that happened was the doctor told me my finger is broken in 2 places, which i already knew, and he gave me a splint, which he said i technically dont even have to wear.  however, i am in hopes that it will heal faster.  but anyway, all this doctor crap is using up all my energy.  i've had to be in the same car with my mother a lot also.  i HATE her driving.  she drives the van, which is automatic, like she's driving stick but bad at it.  i just hate it.  it makes me literally sick.  she keeps making all these comments.  she told me today how she loves my friends more than me.  she and my brother gang up on me.  they just keep saying how i'm mean and rude and whatever.  and you know what?  if i get skin cancer its my skin and my problem.  i'll pay for it later.  i've only been burnt twice since april, and my mother tried to tell me i've been burnt like 20 times. wtf?  and my brother doesnt stop talking.  i honestly am ready to break down.  i need to move out.  i dont like crying every day.  this is SUMMER.  and now i have to spend it babysitting the kids from hell, being around doctors in physical therapy both of which i despise, being excluded by jackie, leeann, and erin, and living in the worst possible place.  oh yeah, i still have to clean like crazy tomorrow so my bed can be moved into my sister's room.  i dont want to be in there.  i just have no energy.    i also dont want to work 8 and 12 hour days next week.  i will literally go insane being around all those kids.  but its all for the money at this point.    i want to see or even just talk to yvonne online so badly.  i know she has problems of her own, but she always makes me laugh.  i miss her.    i need to move away from bowie. i'm ready to make new friends.  high school is over.  i dont need to see pius every day.  i want to keep in touch with monica and yvonne the most, and everyone else i can talk to them online and see them over breaks and it will be all good.    right now i'm listening to the mix cd that jackie made me as part of the present from her and allison "being grown up isnt half as fun as growing up, these are the best days of our lives."  if these are the best days of my life, i want to end it now.  no joke.  i dont know how much more i can take.  i dont know how strong i am.  i know i will make it through this summer, but right now, for the first time in my life, i'm ready for summer to end.  and for some people, it just began on friday.  what a wierd feeling.    cant type anymore now.  it hurts.  i'll probably be back later though to complain about something else...

      i forgot to mention some comments that my mother made today that really made me mad.  i'm so fed up with her.  she doesnt know me at all, and she definitely made that even more clear today.  so in the doctor's office (the first one), the doctor was going down a list of things, asking if i had ever had this or that or whatever.  this is revealing something about myself that i'm not proud of or anything and i might delete this later, but first i need to get it out.  when the doctor got to eating disorder, she looked at me, but my mother said "no" in a tone like "duh".  my mother truly missed 4 years of my life.  well, more like two, but its never truly over, unless you get help.  but no one knows.  actually megan knew at some point, but she didnt care and blew me off.  and if someone knew, they didnt say anything.  but i know my family doesnt know.  they have no clue and thats honestly what hurts the most.  i see them all the time.  if they paid any attention at all to me, they easily would have known.  how could they not?    anyway, so i never like spending time with my mother, and that made it worse, and it was only 10am.  later when we got to the x-ray place, they have to ask if you're pregnant or if there is any possibility you're pregnant.  again, my mother clearly does not know me at all.  that question was on the sheet she was filling out.  so she asks, "are you pregnant, or could you be."  and she looks at me as if she's expecting me to say yes. WTF???  i've never even kissed a boy or dated!  and she's asking me if i've had sex?  i dont get it.  i dont do anything.  i dont drink, do drugs, have sex... but she thinks i'm a slut and get drunk at parties and all that kind of crap.  she doesnt trust me at all.  that pisses me off!!!!  i've never done anything to give her a reason not to trust me.  i'm done with her.  i've been done for a while.  i never want to see her again.  seriously.  i dont want her to die or anything, i just want her out of my life.  i hope she doesnt expect me to write or call next year.    alright, i'm gonna eat some teddy grahams and then go to bed, since i have to wake up at 7am...  :(

      i love morgan - she's so great.  i'm surprised that i actually want to make an effort to hang out with her this summer.  haha i remember talking to monica last summer about how monica never wanted to even talk to morgan again because of the whole leeann, matt, morgan situation.  that was baaaaaddd.  but we all got over it and morgan and matt are happy and i'm good friends with morgan again.    anyway, its so hard to type right now.  i CANNOT believe how much my summer/life can change in one second.  i knew i shouldnt have played basketball last night.  but there had to be a reason the power was out and i was bored.  i just have no clue what that reason is yet.  i broke my finger!!  well, my brother broke it.  and monica and i had just been talking on tuesday about how neither of us had broken anything in our lives.  i really didnt think that it was that serious last night.  i mean, i kept playing basketball after i "jammed" it!!  that was probably really stupid, looking back.    so i woke up early and went to the doctor's this morning for my physical.  first of all, i despise doctors.  i HATE them.  they never do anything for me, and i also hate being in a doctor/hospital type atmosphere.  i dont think anyone understands how much i truly hate doctors.  i hate hospitals and i hate them getting so much money and doing nothing for me.  i mean, i went to a neurologist for 6 months, which probably cost us a fortune.  he didnt care about me at all, he didnt even pretend.  none of my doctors pretend to care.  and so all he did was put me on huge doses of antidepressants for the 6 months.  he didnt care that they were not working.  everytime i saw him, i told him they werent working, and he just upped the dose.  i was gonna get addicted to that shit, so i just stopped taking them one day and i never went back.  plus i hate physicals too.  i felt like crying the whole day.  and i did after i found out my finger was broken.  anyway, so it already didnt start out as a good day.  my middle finger on my left hand was really swollen and its like 10 different colors on one side..  i was just going to ask the doctor what i should do for it, and she was like, "oh my gosh, you need to go get an x-ray right away, it could be really serious."  i was definitely annoyed.  i had already gotten my blood drawn before she came in, and that was bad because the nurse thought she found a good vein.  but when she put the needle in, she lost the vein and she kept moving the needle in a million different directions while it was in my skin.  that hurt like hell.  then the doctor told me i needed to get an x-ray right away, meaning right after i left this office.  that upset me a lot... i couldnt deal with that. but before i left this doctor, i had to get a vaccine for menengitis or whatever.  we waited for 45 minutes before the nurse came back in.  i've never had a shot hurt so much in my life.  my left shoulder still hurts.  so my left arm is just ready to fall off.  my finger, my elbow area, and then my shoulder.  also, the nurse didnt put the bandaid on the spot where she put the shot in my boddy, so i looked at my shirt later, and there was blood all over it.  grooossss.  overall, i was at crofton pediatrics for 2 1/2 hours.  so then we still had to get my x-ray which was in annapolis.  we got there at 12:30 and didnt get out til 2.  thats when they told me my finger was broken and i needed to see a special orthopedic person to examine it and put a splint on.  too bad we didnt get the x-rays while we were there as we found out later.  we got home at 2:30, and my mom called my dad about setting up an appointment at some orthopedic place in annapolis, but they realized they needed a referral (so my dad was gonna have it sent over) and we needed the x-rays and the report from the x-ray place.  i hadnt eaten anything yet, and as i was about to eat, my mother rushes me out of the door saying we had an appointment in 15 minutes, but first we had to go back out to annapolis to get the x-rays.  oh yeah, i had to spend the whole day with my mother too.  so i spent the day with doctors and my mother, all people who i do not enjoy their company to put it lightly.  we got back to the x-ray place around 2:45.  they said they'd give us the x-rays "shortly."  while there, i got two voice mails from my dad, first saying how annoyed he was that i didnt pick up my phone, then saying how we couldnt pick up the x-rays today and that we didnt have a refferal because they cant fax it for some reason, so he had to cancel the orthopedic appointment.  i went back in to the x-ray place and we found out we could get the x-rays today.  too bad it took them an hour.  i didnt get back home til 4:30 and by then i was too tired to eat.  i got the strength later to go to the store to buy rice cakes and teddy grahams.  then i made monica a nice present because she wasnt feeling well for various reasons and because i knew how mad she was about being excluded.  i also burned the usher cd for her so i hope she likes it.  so i brought the present over to her, which really cheered her up, and we talked for about an hour and a half.  but then i had to go at 10:30ish because i didnt tell my parents when i'd be home or anything plus we were both exhausted.  hopefully the weather will be nice tomorrow so we can go to the pool  that is, after i get back from the stupid walk-in at the orthopedic place.  walk-ins start at 8, and my dad wants to get there right at 8.  which means i have to leave the house at 7:30 since the place is in annapolis and so i have to get up at 7.  YUCK    and i'm also mad because i didnt even get paid today because i didnt have the time or the energy to drive all the way out to pointer ridge just to get paid.  i'll call her tomorrow and see what happens.    i loved how allison's away message complained about how burnt she and jackie are from their beach trip.  LMAO.  me and monica got what we wanted.  they really should have used sunscreen, but i bet they didnt use one drop.  which was STUPID because they have fairer skin than i do, and whenever i go to the beach i definitely use sunscreen.  they better not complain to me or monica or else we will go off.  i do not want to hear anything about their trip!!  i'm so mad about today.  and my brother doesnt care at all about breaking my finger.  he just keeps making jokes about it.  and he keeps talking about how excited he is for his drumset to come in.  i swear, if he plays that while i'm in the house i will break it.  i do not need my headaches to get worse just because of him banging on his drums.  he probably has like 5 bucks left in the bank too.  hahaha.    so last night we lost power cuz of the stupid storm.  and all the rain made me slip and fall down a hill.  the water rushing into the drain ate one of my black old navy flip flops!!  im very upset about that...  on a happier note, i think i found the perfect digital camera.  i'm so excited to have a nice camera again.  its expensive, but its definitely worth it.  i want good pictures like meghan!!  i thought it was funny when yvonne was looking at my pictures one time and she commented on how this 35 dollar fugifilm camera of mine took great pictures.  because it really doesnt.  i mean, i guess it does for a regular camera, but i want a digital camera so badly.    MY FINGER HURTS so i'm gonna stop typing now.  that probably was not smart of me to type so much without a splint or anything....

       DrgonFae:  if i'm not working i will come get you and we can go to starbucks  DrgonFae:  i'm not gonna find out til saturday when i'm working tho  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  lol thats where i was gonna skip to!  DrgonFae:  haha  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  its this friday silly  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  not next  DrgonFae:  you mean in two days?  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  friday is before saturday  DrgonFae:  wow  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  yeah. and they said ur qualified to go into the real world  DrgonFae:  i'm not going into the real world, i'm going to college  CrAzYwHiTePoM:  hush   haha i love my cousin allie.  talking to her put me in a much better mood because she is so silly.  and anyway before you think i'm stupid, she never specified which friday she was talking about.  i thought public school ended next week.  oh well.  and why is everyone switching to xanga?  i just found out that she has a xanga thingy to.  maybe i'm slow.    talking to jessie, which doesnt happen often.  i remember when we had deep conversations all the time.  we helped each other out a lot spiritually, though i think she helped me out so much more.  i miss my spirituality of freshman and sophomore year.  i think habitat will be really good for me.  i need to get back in that spiritual mindset.  i want to pray a lot while i'm there.  i want to stay up late and just pray and listen to music in that wonderful chapel.  last time it was such a spiritual experience, but i didnt appreciate it as much as i should have.   this time i'm taking full advantage of that chapel and the whole atmosphere.    anyway i'm exhausted and i need to sleep

      today is just not my day i guess.  it started out not so good, finding out jackie and erin took allison with them to the beach.  but then i did have a really nice time with monica and morgan.  it was very relaxing just to sit outside and have coffee at starbucks and talk for 2 hours.  monica and i joked about having to move into my sister's room.   i was supposed to do that over spring break, but i was too busy and my sister didnt even clean at all.  and i knew it would happen sometime this summer.  my mother insisted today that it be this weekend.  and my bed is the first thing to be moved!!  what???  i dont want to sleep in that room.  not at all.  plus there's crap everywhere in her room.. i dont know how we're supposed to fit everything in there.  my mother said she wanted everything done by sunday.  which means i have to clean A LOT in the next few days as well as work (babysitting the "kids from hell" and the "pissy boy").  what a great weekend...  and to top it all off, my parents said they wanted to 'compromise' for the florida trip.  well, obviously compromise meant doing it their way.  a real compromise was me finding a place to stay thursday night (monica's), get a ride to the airport early friday morning (monica), pay the extra money for the flight (me), and get a ride to the hotel (cab).  and i did all that.  and my dad had already told me that would be fine.  so i will be going with the family on thursday, meaning i cant see the play.  i'm crying now just thinking about it.  i dont even know this cousin who is getting married.  i think i've met her twice.  this stupid wedding caused me to miss out on my last pius musical.  and NOW i cant even see it.  i'm so pissed off.  and my mom was like "dont you want a day [friday] to just spend on the beach and relax?"  no actually i dont because i can go to the beach the 4 other days we're in florida.  i dont even want to go.  i hate family vacations.  i'm so glad monica's coming with me to cape cod.  i would not have survived a family trip there again.  last year was awful.    and then leeann IMing me telling me how happy she is she gets to go to Joseph.  i'm assuming she means the habitat trip.  maybe that will give us a chance to talk about junior year... cuz she clearly has no clue that she excluded me and monica.  the WHOLE year.    you know, i love AOL.  at least at this moment.  it allows me to fake being happy.    i just feel so drained.  i dont feel like talking, at least to certain people.  maybe i should go to bed soon.  i know i need to clean though.  i have so much crap on my floor that i need to go through and organize.  and i also have to get all my notre dame stuff.  right now, all i've decided is my choices for university studies and that i'm taking italian and pe.  and none of those were really optional.  i have to take a language for arts and letters and i have to take pe both semesters and i have to take comp101 or university studies first semester.  i hope i can get out of comp by getting a 4 on the ap english exam.  that would be so great. but it probably wont happen.  i need to pick a science and a history/fine arts/philosophy/theology.   i think i'm missing something but oh well.    i really dont want to work tomorrow.  actually i do to get out of my house.  plus i want to work at least 6 hours so i get paid A LOT on friday.  i need the money to give me motivation to keep going back since next week is gonna be hell.  i'm getting 6 dollars an hour for the second family.  i still dont know what i'm getting for this family.  i'm hoping 9 dollars an hour because 4 kids are a lot to handle and a lot of stress.   it would be really nice next week if i can just take the kids to the pool for a couple hours every day.  i love being outside when the weather is nice.  it'll probably be crappy weather all next week just because i said that.  anyway, i think venting is just making me more pessimistic.  i want to talk to yvonne tonight.  i need a good laugh, and she always can make me crack up.  oh i miss her so much....  and its starting to hit me how much i'm gonna miss monica. i hadnt really been thinking about it until i saw her away message yesterday before we went to the pool.  i'd been thinking about missing yvonne since may.  i cant wait til she gets back from texas so i can see her.    i'll end this on a positive note.  i went to target and bought a really random cd: the temptations greatest hits or something like that.  its great.  and i need to burn monica usher and the backstreet boys.. haha thats kinda wierd.

      i'm tired of all the yelling in my house.  i'm tired of crying.  i'm tired of problems with stupid pius friends.  so today, monica and i find out jackie and erin invited allison to go to the beach with them.    part of my conversation with monica today: DrgonFae:  did you see jackie's away message? Laxkiddo04:  did u see allisons!! DrgonFae:  jackie's going to the beach with allison and erin!!!!!! Laxkiddo04:  shes going with erin and jackie! Laxkiddo04:  im really mad DrgonFae:  so am i! Laxkiddo04:  i hope their car breaks down DrgonFae:  lol Laxkiddo04:  im really angry DrgonFae:  i just dont get it Laxkiddo04:  i mean i couldnt go anyway, but it would have been nice to at least been acknowledged DrgonFae:  i guess we're not jackie's girls DrgonFae:  yeah i know what you mean Laxkiddo04:  i just sent allison an im Laxkiddo04:  teehee DrgonFae:  what did you say? Laxkiddo04:  hope u have fun at the beach with jackie and erin, dont worry, me n laura dont feel excluded at all DrgonFae:  lol DrgonFae:  are they coming back thursday night or morning? Laxkiddo04:  i dont know Laxkiddo04:  oh well, i choose to not care about them  DrgonFae:  you know, if you're going to exclude someone, why would they flaunt it on an away message they know we're going to read?  also...  jackie's away message today: "life has a way or working itself out for the best..."allison kicks ass. getting ready for my beach adventure with the girls, call the cell if u feel the need to check up on us :-P have a lovely day!"  allison's away message today: " YES!! i truly love jackie! she is my best friend/wife in the world!!!!...beach with my 2 hot friends who will alone blow everyone outta the water!!!be back @ 10 on thursday! love you all!! call if needed or just to check up on us!"  i guess me and monica are not jackie's girls anymore.  whatever.  it just sucks how much it hurts to feel excluded again.  and WHY would they flaunt it all on their away message.  obviously we're going to read it.  and i know they're going to be talking about it all the time, especially at habitat.  monica said she hopes their car breaks down haha.  i hope they all come back BURNED and pink and peeling!  cuz you know they want to get tan like me and monica, but they just cant.  i really am tired of crying.  its amazing how much someone can hurt me in just 2 days.  this was monica's away message today: "dont worry everyone, me and laura dont feel excluded, why should we?  r best friends r all going to the beach together and having a grand ol time, y on earth should we feel excluded?"  and then morgan saw my away message, which was similar to monica's, and she was very nice about it all, saying how she knows how we feel and she's sorry we're excluded and if i want to hang out, to just let her know.  i love morgan.  so me, morgan, and monica went to starbucks for 2 hours.  that was very nice.    but then when i got home from starbucks and checked my messages, leeann sent me this: "im sorry that you feel excluded, allison opened the invitation to everyone, its not like she only asked jacke and erin. she was begging someone to go with her actually. and im not with them. if you really wanted to be with them, you should've asked they would've most likely said yes. it wasn't meant to be hurtful. i can understand how you feel though. Have a Good Day and I"m glad you got starbucks:" "and why "again"? i m sorry i think i missed some. i do hope you feel better though"  she doesnt even know that she, jackie, and erin excluded me and monica junior year.  and she shouldnt talk about something and tell me i shouldnt feel hurt and excluded when she doesnt know the whole story!!!  first of all, we werent really referring to allison, we are more referring to jackie and erin having their own little beach thing.  jackie ditched monica (they were supposed to go with mike to the beach today) and so did erin (erin asked monica a while ago about taking a beach trip).  and i just wasnt included.  and also, if they wanted me there, they would have asked.  i'm not gonna invite myself in on their plans, that's just not me.  what the fuck ever.  i am really pissed right now and i'm shaking and i'm tearing up.  i need to leave md.  and i dont even know if i want to invite anyone to cape cod besides monica.  we've already decided she's going and my parents are ok with that.  i dont think i want to ask anyone else now.  i want to have a week with monica before i leave. i'm gonna have to say goodbye to her the 14th before she leaves for california.  she told me today she's sad she has to move in on her birthday because she'll probably be lonely.  i definitely want to do something special for her for her birthday.  maybe i'll do that in cape cod.  i dont know.    anyway i'm still mad, so i'm gonna go eat some teddy grahams or something.  i took the excluded thing off my away message because i dont want leeann to say anything else.  i dont even want to talk to her.  this is the first time that i've openly admitted to myself much less anyone else that i'm mad at leeann.  she's so oblivious to how much she's hurt all of us this year.  and then especially me and monica sophomore year.  why is this all coming out now?? there HAS to be a reason.  teddy grahams and picking my classes for first semester.  how fun

      i havent really been in the mood to write.  i'm not even really in the mood now.  however, i need to get out how hurt i'm feeling.  stupid pius people.  maybe that's why i get along so well with monica - she's not a pius person.  everyone assumes she is, but she didnt go to school at pius and she goes to church at sacred heart.  today was nice.  i hung out with monica from 1 til 9.  i havent done that in so long, and i love her to death.  she's my best friend.  and this was her away message today:   "u know what sucks . .  one of my best friends is moving away to the stupid state of indiana in less than 2 months . . . y does she have to leave me? i love my lauru"  it made me sad... i will miss her a lot next year, but i know it will all be ok.  cuz i know i'm gonna be much happier in indiana.  for christmas, we decided that i'm gonna buy her a nd sweatshirt and she's gonna buy me a towson sweatshirt.  monica told me today that she definitely cant go up there with me to help me move in cuz she's going to california with michelle.  i thought michelle was going with tommy and monica was going with ben.  but then monica says something like, "i want you to know that i was going to take you, but i'm taking jackie."  what??  was my reaction.  i loved that she wanted me there more than anyone in the world besides ben. and i wish to death that i could go, but its not possible because i have to be up there the 20th, and they're not getting back til the 21st..  monica was like "i wanted to do something really really great and fun with you before you leave."  oh man i'm gonna miss monica.  and so now jackie isnt gonna be able to help me move either.  i guess no one is.  but i'm determined to bring monica with me to cape cod.  i will work around her schedule as much as possible so i can bring her.  if i couldnt, i wouldnt be spending any time with her in august and that would not be good at all.  so anyway, monica and i were talking at the pool, and she tells me that she, jackie, and mike cant go on their beach trip because erin and jackie are going to the beach for two days starting tomorrow.  wtf????  and jackie and leeann are hanging out all the time now, and leeann is acting like she doesnt want to be around the rest of us (me and monica) anymore.  this all hurts so much because junior year, me and monica got so close because everyone else excluded us.  i mean, we were always close, but we definitely got so much closer that year.  jackie and leeann purposefully excluded us, brought morgan along with them, and look how that turned out.  morgan stole leeann's boyfriend and made leeann depressed for such a long period of time.  and NOW they're all excluding us again.  i'm fine with me and monica spending the summer hanging out with each other, but it kills both of us that they're doing it again.  junior year, the only reason erin wasnt being excluded was because jackie was close to sarah and bringing her along, so they couldnt leave out erin.  i dont even want to invite leeann, jackie, and erin to cape cod.  i just want monica to go now.  after i went to all that trouble to be allowed to bring 4 people.  i'm so ready to leave.  i dont need to be crying about friends hurting me on top of my crying about my family.  maybe the "pius brats" wont be friends for life.  what a wierd feeling.    i want to run til i collapse tomorrow.  i need to run to take my mind off this shit.  i'm glad i'm gonna go to the pool again with monica.  i love the pool and i love her.  and then i have to babysit the "kids from hell" as yvonne calls them, but at least its only for 2 hours.  well, depending on when the husband gets home.  then i babysit the kids on thursday for 5 hours or so and then i get PAID on friday!!  woohoo!  but i also have a physical on friday and i DESPISE physicals.  oh well.    next week is going to be so exhausting.  i want to run every morning, and i have two babysitting jobs.  one is from 8am til 4pm.  on the two days that i babysit for the mccorkles, i'll babysit from 8 til 2:45 so i can babysit from 3 til 8 over there.  TWELVE HOURS!  i'm going to go insane.  i should be earning over $300 though.  i'll be so happy next weekend especially because habitat is that next monday!    but for now, i'm just pissed to feel excluded again.  at the end of the school year, i thought i was guaranteed 4 friends that i would have no problem staying in touch with.  i was excited to hang out with people, not just the pius people, this summer.  but now i'm realizing its probably not gonna happen.  i need to call leah since she hasnt read my email.  my 3 pius friends are excluding me.  i miss people like kadie and laurice.  i want to see yvonne so badly.  people i love are involved with crap i dont want to be involved with, which is why i'm not visiting them this week with allison.  youth group is no fun.  i'm tired of babysitting "the kids from hell," especially the pissy boy.  i'm so ready to move to indiana and attend my dream school.  for the first time in my life, i'm excited about school.  i love the school i'm going to, i chose the school i'm going to, and i'm moving out.    i took a stress test yesterday online cuz i was bored.  last time i took the test in psychology, i got a 407.  which is ridiculously high.  so i took the test and i noticed i was checking a whole lot of boxes.  the computer adds up the total, and it is 471, but there was also some stuff causing me stress that was not asked about on the test.  wtf?  its summer and my stress level has increased at least 70 points.  and i feel it rising.    I'M SO READY TO LEAVE  i was talking to jessie a while ago online, and she said that she was proud of me for being so brave to move away.  but honestly, courage has nothing to do with it.  this whole year i've wanted to leave.  the only thing i'm sad about leaving is monica and yvonne.  also tiffany and her kids, but i'll see them over winter break and it'll be fine.    tomorrow i want to get up and run, and then pick my tentative classes for 1st semester.   i want to make graduation presents for laurice, leah, and kadie this weekend.  once the presents are made, i have to give them to them.  i wont be able to see them til july now, but i want to make the presents so i wont forget.    one last thought on the 5 of us pius people who are supposedly "best friends forever."  for a while, i really couldnt distinguish who was my best friend because they were all great and everything.  i've known monica the longest, and we've been friends despite not going to the same school until high school.  but up until now, i could not tell anyone who my one best friend was (well, maybe junior year).  but monica is definitely my best friend.  she's never abandoned me.  i've never been mad at her for real, she's never hurt me.  i hope jackie and erin have fun on their beach trip.  maybe they'll realize sometime soon that the five of us are never going to have one last thing together.  i really dont see the five of us doing anything all together before college or maybe even ever.  we might all be on habitat (if leeann makes up her mind), but jackie's gonna be off playing euchre the whole time.    i dont know, maybe i'm not thinking straight tonight.  but they really have hurt me.  i dont like the repeat of junior year this summer.  this is supposed to be the best summer, and the people who are closest to me are hurting me.  what is going on??  maybe its that global warming shit.  i dont know.  in the end i'm so thankful for monica.  and i'm glad i branched out from them during high school.  i stayed friends with the pius people, but i definitely made some great friends.  i dont think erin made any real friends at seton.  she depended too much on us.  and i dont see her branching out in college either.  she'll have jackie in the same dorm and the same living/learning program, and she'll also have like 20 people from seton there and in the area.  and leeann tried to make too many friends, hurting us (at least me, monica, and erin - for example, at the senior retreat when she didnt write us notes, or when she wouldnt go with us in the limo for prom, or when she wouldnt sign our yearbooks) in the process.  i wonder who she'll stay in touch with, honestly.  i dont mind that she wanted to be friends with everyone, but it hurt to see her ignore me.  she acts like she's too good for me.  she's changed so much.  jackie... what can i say?  she's so happy all the time.  i feel like i dont know the real her.  NO ONE can be happy 24/7.  she said she's never really been sad or angry in her life.  i dont think thats possible.  and i cant depend on her for anything.  that is crap.  she keeps saying she's gonna take a road trip up with a bunch of people to visit me next year.  i really wish i could believe her but i dont want to get my hopes up.  deep down i dont think she'll come and that hurts.  i bet she still has that candy for the lacrosse seniors and  i bet she'll eat it.  that was $25 worth of candy, and she used the gas card that my parents gave her for christmas for taking me home during the first half of the year. that pisses me off and she didnt care.  one more thing i'm bitter about that i just remembered. so i'm gonna write about it and then it'll be over with.  this year my birthday was the worst ever.  i was stressed out beyond belief.  only monica said happy birthday and gave me a present.  a couple months later someone (either jackie, erin, leeann, or monica) told me that they had a birthday surprise for me, but leeann told them all not to do it because i was too stressed out.  now first of all, who lets their friend stay stressed out?  also, i dont need presents or anything.  i know we all need money for other stuff and we're not rich or anything.  but a simple happy birthday...  and then whoever told me that also said they were gonna do it at a later date.  whatever - that didnt happen.  this is just another example of how monica's always been there for me.  she gave me like 10 random presents, all great inside jokes.  and also for my 16th birthday, no one cared but her.  she took me out to see swimfan.  haha not the best movie, i dont remember why we both wanted to see it in the first place.  but whenever i see that movie i think of monica and how much i love her.  she was the only one who said happy birthday that sunday too.  that was an interesting day.  some random seton people were there, like laura sickles.  i wonder how she's doing.  probably still sleeping with that guy who she was engaged to but then broke up with.  she might even still be living with him.  i dont even know.  oh i miss when laura and i were close.  and then she drifted away, but that's another story.  now i'm done, and i'll probably never think about that again.  that was a very random memory.  i'm sure i learned how i remembered it at some point in psych this year...  "the hardest part of love is the letting go" - children of eden  that play was such an amazing experience.  we've all grown up so much since them.    maybe its time to let go.  if leeann is gonna be happy with her other friends, then i'll let her be happy.  same with erin and jackie.  if they dont want me in their life, then thats fine.  i just want to know so i can get some closure.  anyway, i'm going to bed now and for once i'm glad i have a headache so i can concentrate on something else....

      but before i get into that, let me write down some interesting quotes from this evening at leeann's party:  "and you could...cuz it was too big for your pants" - leeann (referring to ricardo's cup)  "look at her butt go!" - molly (talking about megan as she was walking down the hallway)  "are you good at basketball?" - camille "i guess.  i played for 8 years and i'm much better than half seton's team.  i definitely could have made varsity" - me "you cant be good at basketball cuz you're white!" - camille"you're racist!!" - me (and then i ran inside) "its ok that you suck at basketball cuz you're racist" - camille (trying to apologize but she kept getting all her words mixed up.  she said wierd phrases like that 5 times at least)  anyway, i really am worried about yvonne.  i just wrote her an email, i hope she writes back.  but for now, all i can do is pray for her so i'm gonna go do that soon  jackie and allison gave me a great present tonight!  i'm listening to part of it now - what a great cd  before i forget, this is my schedule for tomorrow: wake up at 10 mow the lawn call mrs. mccorkle to find out my schedule for this week (since she didnt pick up her phone today!) shave and shower pick up jackie at 12 then go to glendale splash park to get jobs... we want to be water attendants cuz we dont want to be lifeguards and save 10 kids a day leave for amanda's party at 1:30, stay til 3:30,4ish pick up allison aka trallison (even though its wayyyyy out of my way) and go to beth and megan's party

      St. Dennis is the patron saint of headaches and rabies haha.  i'm trying to figure out why he's the patron saint of headaches though.  i want to learn more about him before i pray to/through him.  i cant find a biography or anything.  all i know is that his feast day is october 9th.  maybe they'll have something at the christian bookstore about him.  i dont know...  "Because an angel supposedly carried his head from Montmartre to the abbey of Saint-Denis which was built over his tomb, he is also invoked against headaches."  i dont like that.  i thought he would have had severe migraines or something in his life.  he didnt experience anything like i do.  i want to talk to someone who's lived with headaches like i do.  they dont seem to be stopping anytime soon, so i want to find out how people live with them for years and years.  who knows how i've lived with them for over 2 1/2 years.  crazy stuff.

      oh my goodness!  if mark wants to talk to me, fine.  but WHY does he IM me just to criticize me or yell at me or whatever??  i'm so annoyed with him and his pissy attitude.  sorry, needed to vent about that.  i think i'll get mad everytime i talk to him this summer, so i really wish he would just stop trying to talk to me.  i dont need to 'deal' with anyone.. i already am forced to deal with my family.  anyway, i'm listening to a bunch of random songs right now.  its great.  haha there are some interesting pop songs from like 4 years ago... i finally listened to thursday tonight.  jackie still hasnt burned me their cds.  i like 'understanding in a car crash' a lot.  aww its bryan adams 'star' from that movie jack.  what a great song.   What cha wanna be - when you grow up  What cha gonna do - when your time is up  What cha gonna say - when things go wrong  What cha wanna do - when you're on your own   There's a road - long and winding  The lights are blindin' - but it gets there Don't give up - don't look back  There's a silver linin' - it's out there somewhere  Everybody wants an answer - everybody needs a friend  We all need a shinin' star on which we can depend  N' so tonight we're gonna wish upon a star  We never wished upon before - (to find what you're  looking for)  There'll be times - in your life Ya when you' be dancin' n' shit - but you ain't gettin it But don't get disillusioned - no, don't expect too much  Cuz if what you have is all you can get - just keep on  tryin' - it just ain't happened yet  Everybody wants ta be winner - everybody has a dream  We all need a shinin' star when things ain't what they seem  So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star  We never wished upon before - (gotta get where you're  headed for)   Everybody wants some kindness - everybody needs a break  We all need a shinin' star when things get hard to take  So tonight we're gonna wish upon a star  We never wished upon before  i like how i just copy the lyrics from a random site.  i'm too lazy to write them out myself.  i havent heard this song in a looonnng time.  wow, i just remembered i was writing leah an email.  and i started one to yvonne way before that.  too bad mark had to IM me.  maybe i should get back to them.  i miss leah.  i hope she's moved out with her dad and i hope things with her family are ok.  haha i need to call kadie to find out what i can do with my hair.    tomorrow i need to: -write out all my thank you notes so i can send them monday -call mrs. mccorkle to find out schedule for next week, plus payment -buy some picture stuff (scrapbook, frames, etc) -call erin to find out where she got her frames -go to leeann's grad party!!  and bring jackie prom pictures -sing at church - my last mass at sacred heart, probably for a while (dont know how i feel about that one) -write yvonne an email, probably after i read her blog or whatever her xanga thing is called   i think thats it.  i would love to go to the pool, but i think i'll just try again monday  but before i go, let me just say that i am really concerned about yvonne.  i feel so bad that her summer sucks so far, she doesnt know about her job yet, and that texas and everything is stupid.    "i'm fucking seething."  that was her last post.  :(   and then the last IM she sent me was this face:  :'(  i really hope she wasnt crying.  i hope its not that bad although it seems that way.   she did sound excited though when i told her that the "pissy boy" as she called him did not pee at all today.  or at least i didnt know it if he did pee.  he didnt pull down his diaper (thank goodness for pullups!) or anything.  i hope she emails me tomorrow so i know whats going on.  no matter what, i'm praying for her tonight because i know i would be uncomfortable in that religious-type atmosphere, so i know she's much much more uncomfortable.  i cant even imagine what kind of "meeting" she had tonight.  oh man i miss her a lot.  i definitely cannot wait to frolic in the park with her haha

      that has been my phrase of the year.  and i'm saying it again tonight.  i need to move on and i dont know how.  i cant wait til august or i'll waste my summer.  so i stayed up til 2am to watch one of the newer episodes of boy meets world.  then i have this urge to listen to "the freshman," which i dont think i've heard since last summer at habitat..   i cant believe i'm letting myself listen to it because i know it will make me cry.  its a sad song, and for a while, any sad song makes me cry - it makes me think about the crap going on in my life.  so i'm going to reflect on stuff, mostly family crap, once again..  but first, i'm really confused spiritually.  i've contemplated not labeling myself as a Catholic...  i really do like mass.  i love the peace it can give me.  i regret going to confession on the retreat.  people kinda persuaded me to go, convinced me that it was the right thing to do.  but its not like i was lost without confession.  i still had my faith and i prayed almost every day.  i definitely think i was better off without it.  i hate how confession makes me feel.  i did not get any sense of peace like jackie gets from it.  its made me feel so horrible.  this priest made me feel like an awful person for not going to confession for 3 years. just because i didnt have the formality of confession does not mean that i wasnt sorry for whatever i did.  i still talked to God, told Him what i did wrong, and asked for forgiveness.  i dont need a priest to tell me God forgives me.  what kind of faith would that be if that were the case?  i really feel strongly about confession now.  for a while i didnt know how i felt about it.  but now, i definitely believe that i dont need confession.  not that i'm better than it or something.  however, for me, personally, i dont think i should be forced to do something that makes me completely uncomfortable.  maybe i'll try it again, maybe not.  maybe i'll go to notre dame and get some realization there or something.  but for now, confession has made me feel like crap.  the only good thing that i got out of it was the priest telling me to stop trying to work out my family situation.  its not worth all the time and energy  before i get into my family situation, let me complain one more time about mark.  i dont know what happened, and i'm not the only one noticing how wierd he's acting.  all he wants to do is play euchre with jackie.  he gets so into that game like its his life, and he's SUCH a sore loser.  he'll never admit it though.  and then he's never serious.  how am i supposed to be friends with someone if i cant even sit down and have a conversation with him?  its ridiculous.  he expects me to be nothing but nice to him when he's never genuine with me.  i wish i could tell him off, but i wouldnt do that just because of the person i am.  plus, he's going on that week-long habitat trip...  i regret pushing him to go.  but he was nice then.  there was no way i could have known about his attitude problem now.  haha he told my sister that he thinks i hate the watch he bought me for graduation because i wasnt wearing it the day after he gave it to me.  well, first of all, when he saw me at my house, i had just gotten home from babysitting the 4 kids.  why would i wear a nice watch to a baysitting job??  second of all, i simply dont like watches.  why do you think i never wear one?  if i want to know the time, i will check my cell phone or look at a clock or ask someone who likes to wear a watch.  so basically he had no basis for his assumption, and i'm sorry if it hurts him that i dont like watches and i'm not wearing the one he bought me 24/7.  why couldnt he just get a gift certificate like he did for my sister and brother?  and why did he get my brother a present in the first place?  anyway, i just dont get him and i dont want to see or talk to him for a while.    so back to my family.  i really really thought that during the summer it would get better.  i dont know why i thought that.. i just assumed it.  or maybe i just didnt think about it.  i'm tired of having to deal with my family.  my stress level should not be high this summer.  i have no school work to do, i actually want to read for fun (the first time in 4 years), i can take naps almost every day, i've been sleeping in for a month, i got into notre dame (but my family even fucked that up.  yeah the stuff my mother was saying, besides her flat out not wanting me to go there, was definitely a little bit shady) so i'm moving to another state in august... i just shouldnt be stressed out.  i am just really tired of crying.  i'm tired of being emotionally drained.  my family just sucks all the energy out of me.  i'm tired of being yelled at, i'm tired of feeling lonely and feeling like no one cares of me.  maybe if i brought up crap from the past... i dont know if i'm ready to admit some of it.  my family cannot even begin to comprehend how much they hurt me, especially freshman and sophomore year.  when i look back at how much they didnt care about me... i lose it.  i'm definitely crying right now.  its just hard to see your family, who's supposed to care the most about you, care the least about you.  my family saw me all the time those 2 1/2 years.  they should have noticed that something was seriously wrong.  but instead, i had a few friends abandon me and my family was never there to begin with, so i 'dealt' with it myself, and i still struggle with it today.  literally today.  it sucks and i dont know what to do.  i dont know who i can trust.  well, its not a trust issue.  its more of an 'i dont know who i want to open up to' issue.  i could name 5 people right now who i could tell and who i could completely trust.  i just dont know if i want to let anyone into this aspect of my life.  when i let meg fitz in... man she disappointed me like anything.  i wonder if she wonders (since i;ve been seeing her at least once a week for the past 2 years) how i'm doing.  i wonder if she knows how much she hurt me.  i really wonder if she was ever truly concerned about me.  cuz she didnt show it.  but my family disappointed me the most.  they should have known whereas megan, who really only saw me during school, had a slight idea.  i feel like i should bring it up before college.  get it all out in the open and then i can leave everything behind.  but part of me just doesnt want to bring it up until i've completely handled it all myself.    why is this all coming out tonight?  i guess i'm just in a reflective mood.  i dont know.  maybe it all comes down to the fact that at the end of the day i'm not happy and in this house i dont know how to get happy.  i really want to have a good conversation with yvonne.  i cannot wait for her to get back from texas so we can hang out.  i miss her a lot.    right now especially, i just feel so different from everyone else.  i read some people's blogs and talk to people, and i know i'm innocent.  i dont drink or do drugs, i get good grades, i work hard, i've never had a boyfriend or even gone on a date.  and i'm fine with it, and its not like i desire to go out and drink or whatever, but it definitely sets me apart.  i notice this most with yvonne.  i love her to death, and i'm so glad to know her and be friends with her, but i do see how different we are.    oh yeah, on a random note, when i went to starbucks tonight, i ordered two drinks, one for jackie and one for me.  this 30 year old bald guy was the cashier, and he only rang up one drink.  i've never gotten a free drink, and it was very nice.  but he was definitely at least 30.  however, i've decided i can use this to my advantage - if starbucks is hiring.  that would be so great to work there.  employees get freeeeee coffee!  that's my favorite kind of coffee!  :)  oh i would love to work at starbucks... much more than at dirty glendale splash park where i would have to save like 50 kids a day.  apparently they dont really know how to swim there.  i dont know.  but speaking of pools, i want to go to the pool tomorrow more than anything.  swimming would take a lot of this crap off my mind.  the perfect day tomorrow would be to sleep in, lay outside and listen to music, swim at the pool, work for 6 hours, and then do something nice.  maybe go to the movies.  i would probably be going by myself but thats ok.  i really want to see "saved."  i'm not quite sure what its about, but it looks good.  but why isnt it playing at any theatres near me?  anyway  goodnight i'm tired cuz its 3 in the morning...

      i did end up going to youth group.  it was interesting.  there was no talk - i dont remember the last time we had a good, serious discussion.  that SUCKS!  and i was talking to monica, and we realized we're not sad about leaving youth group at all.  the only reason i come to youth group now is to talk to tiffany and leigh and to see a couple people, like KELLY! and monica and ben.  so i got to youth group, and i was the first older kid there which was not fun.  when allison got there, she threw her purse in my face and said there was something in there for me but i couldnt see it and she'd give it to me later (which she never did).  then jackie got there and we both had a craving for coffee, so after announcements, which took like a half hour, me and allison went to starbucks.  when we got back i just sat and talked to monica and kelly the rest of the night.  i remember two years ago when youth group was so great, especially during the summer because we'd stay til 11 or midnight.  i dont like the youth ministers now because they just kick us out so they can play poker...  anyway, we went to mcdonalds on 197 afterwards.  it was alright.  i just cant help thinking about how much i loved youth group, but now i'm more than indifferent towards it - i honestly dont like it anymore.  at first, i thought that it was part of me just getting older and being ready to move on.  but now thinking and talking about it, its really not that at all.  youth group and the people in it are just stupid.  i think me, leeann, and monica should be youth leaders again.  we'd definitely make it better.  oh well, i'm leaving in august so its whatever.  oh yeah!!!  i forgot to say how stupid euchre is.  jackie and mark are obsessed with it and i hate it.  i wish ben had never taught us that STUPID card game.  they get so into it, and they've been playing it at every youth group and wherever else they go.  its ridiculus, and they're going to play it on every single break at habitat.  me and monica are going to go crazy!!!  anyway.  allison's lollipops are sooo good.  i've had like 5 today.  and i had a candy necklace and two fortune cookies.  i love allison's rich parties because she has such good food and lets me take it home.   i think i'm liking this blog thing a lot.  i write too much but its ok.  it definitely helps me vent.  but i'm bored now and tired of writing.  if anything, i need to write people thank you notes and senior pictures.  plus i need to email/call people cuz i havent talked to them in a while.  AND i need to get a second job.  i was thinking about lifeguarding or being a "water attendent" at glendale splashpark because that job was pretty much guaranteed, but then annie keeps saying how disgusting that place is.  i mean, i played volleyball at that community center, and it wasnt the nicest place.  but i really just need money, which means i need a job.  i still dont even know how much i'm getting paid for babysitting or my work schedule for that family.  i was going to talk to her today, but she got strep as well as one kid.  i dont know if i already said this, but they better be taking antibiotics so i can babysit tomorrow for 6 hours - i need the money!    i think boy meets world is on.  i know its on at one, so i definitely want to watch that tonight.   i only have a couple pages left in my senior book to do.  i need to do prom and graduation, and then 2 or 3 random pages.  i also need to clean my room.  and i want to get my hair cut before habitat.  i dont know how short though.  maybe i'll get it cut like 6 or so inches, so i can just get it trimmed in august before i leave and it will be able to grow to this length again during the year.  i dont know.  kadie would probably come over and hurt me if i cut it 6 inches.  maybe only 4.  i'll call her and ask her opinion lol.  of course, her opinion is probably that i never cut it.    i'm gonna go watch tv for a little bit. maybe there's another newlyweds marathon.  actually, the mtv movie awards is probably on.  how nice

      when was the last time i said that?  i used to jump at the chance to go to youth group when i had time.  but talking to katie really made me realize how much i dislike what youth group has become the last couple years.  no more spiritual retreats, no more serious or deep discussions (they're always one-sided now, and its a bunch of conservative people - like the old people at sacred heart).  and i'm beginning to realize (again) how much i dislike sacred heart.  the priests are soooo conservative, even fr. tim, and i dont like it at all.  i DO NOT want a priest making me feel guilty for not going to confession once a month or once a week.  i really do not believe that i'm going to hell just because i dislike confession and the formality of it.  that's been bugging me since the retreat.  its not like i'm going to stop going to mass or anything.  but i do think that once folk group is over (i think it might be this saturday), i'm gonna start going to pius again.  that helped build up my faith after 8th grade so maybe it will help.  i dont know.  i just like st. pius so much more because they are a lot less conservative.    i didnt have work today because the mother and one kid has strep(?).  that sucked.  i really need money.  but i better not get sick.  both my parents and my brother are sick, and have been for a while.  and now the family i babysit is sick.  i really dont want to get sick.    today's my mother's birthday.  i didnt even say happy birthday to her.  the only reason why i know is because my dad told me around midnight last night.    i think i've decided that i'm going to youth group.  i dont want to talk to certain people, like mike or mark, or even see them, but i really do want to play football.  maybe kelly will be there.  whatever.  if i go and the talk sucks and then it starts raining, i can always leave. i'm just in the mood to run around and play football.  and my sister wont be there and neither will my brother!  when will be the next time that happens?  i definitely did not like being at youth group with both my siblings, or even one of them.  its always been my thing...  i'll write more later

      today was actually nice.  i was only supposed to work for 2 hours, but i worked 5.  i wish i could have gone with monica to the pool though cuz who knows when we'll both have a day off again.  i'm finding out about a lifeguarding job at glendale splash park.  it would be nice to work with ayanna, and i like the pool..  hopefully it will all work out because i need money!!  also, i was supposed to go to allison's and erin's party for 10 minutes, but i was there for an hour and a half.  it was great cuz i saw beth, megan, camille, molly, meghan, monica, ben, and so many other nice people.  however, i saw mark and mike, and that was not good, so i just ignored them.  and mark acted hurt as usual.  the party was also good because i actually ate real food (a hamburger and pasta salad), and i took home lots of sugar - candy necklaces and gooooood lollipops!  allison has the best food at her parties.  its cuz she's rich.  i'm not rich like that so i dont eat real food today.  let's see, i had mini chocolate chip pancakes, a granola bar, and coffee again. this really is not healthy at all.    babysitting was an adventure.  the little boy likes to pee outside a lot (its happened two days in a row and it will probably happen tomorrow).  but first, he MUST rip his diaper off and then pee on himself.  thank goodness its outside cuz i would not want to clean the house.  and the kids actually ate grapes today, though they also had ice cream sandwiches.  i really need to find out how much i'm getting paid though.  it better be at least 7 dollars an hour, hopefully 8 or 9.   4 kids under 5 are definitely a handful and not easy by any means.  the little boy likes his penis and pees anywhere but his diaper, the next boy cries and whines a lot, the girl just always wants to go outside, and the oldest boy is nice but wants to do everything his way.  and they are all really hyper especially when they're all together.  it's all understandable cuz they're little kids, but i just think i should be paid a good amount to watch them.    i have a lot of bug bites and i dont like it.  i think its because of going outside while i'm babysitting.  there seems to be a lot of mosquitos in the pointer ridge area.     i still havent written any thank you notes.  i definitely need to do that by the end of this weekend.  plus i need to read all my notre dame stuff.    yvonne just got off.  no one else online i want to talk to.  good night i'm sure i have stuff to do

      seriously, he needs to leave.  he's all sweaty and why the hell is he climbing on top of me as i'm lying on the couch watching the real world?  he's acting like mike, touching me all the time.  i dont like that.  i already have bruises on my stomach from earlier.  i'm ready to yell at him, but i dont want to because then he'd just make me feel more guilty.  i dont like him being at my house during the times i want to be alone aka now.  i dont feel like hanging out when i'm in my house at 11.  if i were out with friends, then yes, i'd want to talk (but probably not to him).  i really wish i could just yell at him and tell him that he's annoying the crap out of me and i hate the watch and everything.  but i'm not like that.  that would be mean...  so for now i'll just complain and whine, and then hopefully he'll be out of my life for a while starting tomorrow.  its funny though, cuz i remember in january after the ski trip when i endlessly defended him and stuck up for him.  everything was great then, but after he became great friends with tommy and megan, everything changed.  and its fine.  its wierd how i like tommy the best out of those three.  freshman year i loved megan to death, but then she treated me like crap, so i finally let go of our 'friendship.'  and also i despised tommy freshman year cuz he treated bitsy like crap.  and this year i loved mark's company and all.  but now he annoys the crap out of me and i cannot stand him anymore.  i'm done with trying to be friends with him.  and that's all i have left to say about that.    i dont know how i feel about my sister leaving for germany.  i'm happy and i'm glad i wont be sharing her room this summer with her.  i would go CRAZY.  she's been getting on my nerves lately too.  she acts like she wants to be close and best friends and stuff.  its all fake - we've never been close.  i remember when i got my concussion she like held my hand in the ambulance, and all i could think of was that i wanted her to let go and i wanted one of my friends there.  she's always treated me like crap.  she never wanted me around.  so now i dont want to be around her all the time and she wonders why.  i have my own life.  she follows me now sometimes.  whatever.  i need a second job.  this babysitting job is crazy.  4 hyper kids under the age of 5 hopefully 4 days a week.  i babysat today from 2:45 to 8:30, and tomorrow it should be around 6 to 8:30.  i think i'm babysitting friday too.  in the meantime, i need to find some way to make money during the day.  i will never be babysitting for her before 3, so i need some kind of second job.  i dont even care if its babysitting or not.  i just need more money.  i also need a reason to be out of my house more.  i cant sit outside every day this summer or i'll probably die of skin cancer or something.  you know, i joke about the fact that my stress level was 407 when we took that stress test in psych, but honestly, i think its gone up.  that is not good.    i still need to write thank you notes.  maybe i'll do that tomorrow because all i have planned is to lay outside while my sister and brother are home and then babysit at 6.  i also need to read all the packets and pamphlets from notre dame.  i need to start picking my classes and stuff.  and i love how my dad lost a letter from them that had the forms for my physical and health stuff.    and i gotta love how i'm still not eating a lot.  right now i'm sitting here hungry but i have no desire to eat.  all i've had today are some mini chocolate chip pancakes, a granola bar, coffee, and goldfish.  that's so bad.  its not a lot of food plus its not healthy at all.  that's how i've been eating recently.  and does my family care?  i wouldnt know because they dont even notice.  they've never noticed.  maybe i'll buy food for myself tomorrow. haha i could go get like 100 of those sugar free ice pop things to get myself ready for the crap they call food at the sarnelli house in philly.  i could get some burnt pretzels sold as "extra special dark pretzels" too.  actually, those ice pop things sound good, but i would get ones with sugar in it.  and i want coffee tomorrow too.  however, i think i have to walk to get any type of food tomorrow.    i've also been noticing how i only have athletic shorts and baggy t-shirts to wear.  i dont have any other clothes..  its ridiculous and i really need to go buy some new clothes.  well, at least i have my old navy flip flops. i live in those  i'm really tired.  i only got 4 hours of sleep last night and those kids wore me out.  however, i know i wont be able to sleep because my sister and mark are like yelling and pounding on the floor an doing who knows what.  why does he have to hang out here?  why cant she go over there?    now i'm excited cuz i'm gonna listen to the calling's new cd without buying it!  "Cause these are the days worth livin'  These are the years we're given  And these are the moments  These are the times  Let's make the best out of our lives"  what a nice song.    hmm... i really dont want to waste my summer just waiting to move to notre dame.  i mean, i am excited to go to indiana, but i do want to enjoy my summer.  that's just more motivation to get a job during the day so i'm out of my house for my jobs a lot, and then on the nights and weekends i dont babysit i'll just make sure i find something to do, like stay in touch with people from seton.  alright, i'll start my job search tomorrow!  shoooooot!  allison and erin are having their joint bday party tomorrow.  i dont have anything for either of them, and plus i have to be at babysitting at 6 and i'm not quite sure when i'll get out of there.  i told them i'd be there... i can always stop by for 10 minutes beforehand and 10 minutes afterwards... whatever.    i'm gonna chat with leeann for a bit and then go to bed.  hopefully mark will not attack me or try to talk to me sometime in between...  i'm spent and emotionally and mentally drained

      mark needs to get the hell out of my house.  he needs to stop bugging me and hurting me to the point where i get bruises.  so WHAT if i don't want to play a game with him and my sister?  i walk in the house after 5 hours with 6 kids under the age of 7 and there he is, ready to bug me.  and then after the hundredth time i tell him i dont want to play, he goes on to try and make me feel guilty about "not making time to spend with him."  its not like we're best friends.  he's best friends with my sister, and he came here to see him.  i'm tired of him getting on my nerves...  i was seriously in an ok mood.  my sister's leaving tomorrow, so i'll have a nice morning/afternoon semi to myself.  i was tired when i got home, but nothing horrible had happened today.  he seriously needs to get out of my life.  i dont need this shit in my life, especially right now.  and i know i'm mad/upset/frustrated a lot when i cus because i normally hate it and dont do it.    maybe i'll write more later, but for now i need to write yvonne an email because her blog was not happy at all and i want her to know i'm thinking about her and praying for her

      by the way, i was talking to leeann and she told me how high her temp. was and she took medicine and it helped her feel better.  drugs really aren't always good.  one thing bugging me right now is mark.  in the card he gave me for graduation, the first thing he wrote was "i know me and you dont get along."  that pissed me off.  maybe our personalities just clash, but he makes it seem like its all my fault.  everything he says is sarcastic to me, but when i'm sarcastic back he gets mad at me.  and then when he wont stop being sarcastic, he gets mad at me for stopping talking to him.  i cant win.  i just need space from him.  hopefully since my sister is leaving wednesday i'll see him a lot less.  i'll see him at youth group, but i probably wont even be going every thursday.  even if i do, i can just play football or not talk to him altogether.  it sounds mean, but he's really getting on my nerves.  i'm TIRED of him making me feel guilty!!!  more than anything - that's crap my mother pulls, and i do NOT need it from him.  on a high note, though, i talked to jessie!!  granted, it was only for five minutes, but i hadnt talked to her in weeks.  i havent seen her in a year.  i'm so ready to see her and talk to her.  i need to do something really special for her before i go to college.    so today was nice.  i really did nothing.  i went outside for a couple hours, i watched tv, and i worked on my senior book.  i actually need to work on it more tonight, but i want to be in bed by midnight.  i'm excited for my job tomorrow.    i want to meet the kids who i'll be spending so much time with this summer.  i'm excited for the money too. i still dont know how i'm paying for notre dame.  and i got my course selection in the mail today.  i cant wait to sit down and read it all and pick my classes.  i'm soooo ready to LEAVE!!  but actually, i'm not.  i'm ready for the college experience and i'm ready to move out of my house.  i'm gonna miss certain people a lot though.  i've never been away from monica before.  well, we didnt go to elementary school or middle school together, but we stayed friends the whole time.  i'm not worried about losing touch or anything, but i know i'm going to miss her a lot, more than anyone else.  i'll probably miss yvonne next.  she is the person i got closest to at seton who i didnt know before high school.  i already miss seeing her every day a lot.  leeann, jackie, and erin - i know we'll stay friends.  even if we dont talk constantly online or on the phone, when we come back from breaks we will definitely hang out and everything will be the same.  anyway, that's enough for now.  i have to wake up early for a dentist appointment tomorrow.  who travels an hour just to go to the dentist?  my family does and its soooo stupid.  why cant we go somewhere in bowie.  oh well.  goodnight to no one, cuz i havent given anyone this website yet

      i opened my financial aid package expecting barely anything at all.  i definitely did not expect ANY scholarship.  $15700 may not seem like a lot, but for notre dame its soooo good, especially since i didnt even think that they gave scholarships.  so that is definitely the highlight of my night, besides cheating in uno with monica (but i'll get back to that later)  this weekend was my last st. pius youth group retreat.  i dont know what i was expecting.  all i know was that my expectations werent too high because of the people who were going.  i think of a retreat as a spiritual experience.  i was talking to monica today about how we used to get spiritual highs from retreats and we used retreats to get away from the real world.  but the last two years, the incoming freshmen havent cared about spirituality and the retreats with them have been horrible, this fall especially.  this weekend was a little better, but only because i made it spiritual on my own.    so when we got to the place, we ate dinner, and then we played some games for icebreakers.  i dont remember what we did first - think it was charades or something.  then we split into two groups and each group had to think up five challenges they wanted the other group to do.  but whatever challenge the group wrote down, the group that wrote it down had to be able to do it themselves.  what really pissed me off was that the younger people in my group wrote down stuff like freakdancing and whatever.  i was disgusted.  this was supposed to be a spiritual retreat and we are a christian organization from a catholic church.  what the hell?  first of all, it was a horrible way for me to start out a retreat - they on the other hand obviously didnt care.  second of all, i dont freakdance or do anything like that.  i'm innocent and i know it.  and i just dont do that.  those people just really upset me.  then we were supposed to freakdance or whatever so the other group would do it, and i wouldnt, so my group got mad at me.  i dont know why, but i started crying.  not bawling, but tearing up.  looking back, i think it was because no matter what i expected, i still hoped for a spiritual retreat.  i NEEDED to get away from the "real world".  more than anything i needed a weekend where i didnt think about my family. and i just got upset.  so the game ended becasue it was stupid and the other group didnt even follow the rules.  then we had our dedication thing and opening prayer.  that was nice - i always like that part.  i dedicated this retreat to yvonne.  i knew she was going to texas on saturday and i knew she also has problems with her family.  also, i just missed her and i'm grateful she's in my life.  i really hope her trip to texas is wonderful and great and everything good.  tommy gave his talk next.  it wasnt spiritual - it was just about government and international and national affairs and the catechism, all of his favorite things...  after that, we had free time.  i played cards so jackie and mark would stop bugging me about playing euchre.  then i played hide and go seek in the "haunted" house, and its really not scary.  the only thing i was scared about was walking up the stairs in the dark - i couldnt see anything and i could definitely believe that i would fall down which would hurt.  we went to bed around 1:30.  i couldnt sleep so i just listened to sugarcult for 2 hours or something before i got tired.  i just have to ask one thing.  please tell me why girls slept together in the same bed, when we had 5 extra beds???  alane and betsy slept together both nights and joanna and liz slept together friday night.  allison and jackie were gonna sleep together, but then monica scared them so jackie slept in her own bed both nights.  allison complained last night, so joanna slept with her and liz got all pissy.  i just dont understand!  we were sleeping in these extra small twin beds.  and they were bunk beds.  i mean, these girls arent huge or anything, but why did they sleep together?  at least i know i'm not crazy for thinking that, because monica felt the same way.  yesterday was not exciting.  the talks were not extra special or anything.  mark, i dont know the point of his talk.  leigh, her talk was alright on serving others. but i really dont like small group discussions.  i wanted to hear what everyone had to say.  we had sooo much free time though. we played trainwreck - that was a lot of fun. i'm actually a little sore from it.  then we played some cool game.  it was great and monica won the first time we played it and then i won the second time.    the main part of yesterday for me, maybe not the highlight, was confession.  i hadnt gone to confession since freshman or sophomore year.  i cannot remember if i went to confession on the fall retreat sophomore year.  anyway, i hate confession.  i dont see the point of it when i pray everyday and i confess my sins to God on my own.  i dont need a priest to intervene.  some people might and i know some people get really relieved after confession and get a nice feeling of peace.  i dont get that.  flat out.  i just dont.  i thought i might last night but i didnt.  basically, i didnt really have specific sins to confess, but i just talked about my family situation.  it was nice to hear fr. tim tell me to stop trying to fix things because its clearly not worth it. but he did make me feel bad about not going to confession for 3 years.  i still dont know what i think about confession, but i do know that i dont enjoy it.  then we had mass.  it was long and i was extremely tired.  after mass we played some game.  it might have been charades again, and then i played poker for 2 hours.  i came in third!  which was amazing since it was the first time i had played texas hold'em.  today was fun.  megan's talk was about family, and i just wasnt in the mood to hear about that, so i kind of tuned her out.  right after that, we quickly changed to do this service project thing.  it had been raining all weekend, so it was very very wet and muddy and yucky outside, and just our luck, the project was taking this plastic crap off of newly planted trees.  haha i was jackie's partner and we made it this community survice survivor thing.  tiffany said that whoever collected the most things could shower when we got back.  i definitely got knee-deep in mudd/water today.  there were like 3 main alliances, and jackie and i got separated for a while, so i joined megan, tommy, ben, and monica's alliance.  however, while jackie was trying to find me, she joined mark, jeff, tiffany, and peter's alliance.  that was funny.  but i made her ditch them becasue we won with the other alliance.  anyway, that's how silly we are but its ok cuz we made our own fun in the crappy weather.    i was so excited to go home.  all i wanted to do was shower and take a nap, but i had to go to allison's graduation party.  it was nice, but i just realized how rich she was today.  they had catered food, and two cakes, and a remodeled basement, and a hugggggeeee house (aka a mansion like melanie's).  it was ridiculous.  PLUS she's having a birthday party wednesday at her house with erin.  whatever.  i dont need that.  oh yeah, i ate so many fortune cookies (even though the fortunes were stupid.  i like michelle's ideas: you will die tomorrow or failure is imminent.  haha its more exciting then "let's turn our tassle now" or "conGRADulations!")  my sister's going away party is today also (and its still going on actually).  is it wrong of me to be happy that she's going away for 2 months to germany?  i mean i love her and all, but i hate living with her.  oh yeah, one funny thing about her was today i came home and she was wearing a new miniskirt (the popular ones, the ones with the ruffles and crap), and it was cute and whatever.  but she sat down, and i saw something black underneath her skirt, and she told me she was wearing spandex shorts underneath her skirt.  i laughed so hard.  it really was short though.  plus i have to move into her room like next week.  oh joy, bunk beds and everything.  at least i get the top bunk... that means i have to seriously clean my room this week.  i need to sleep now, but i really hope the weather is nice and warm and sunny tomorrow.   i need to lay outside and clear my head and listen to music - i've come to depend on that as a daily thing due to my house.  i also want to go to the pool.  i've wanted to swim since the first day the pool opened but i've either not had the car or the weather's been bad or i've been too busy.  so tomorrow i definitely want to go.  oh yeah, i want to finish my senior book this week.  i need some closure with high school and all my pictures.  i'm really excited for leeann's graduation party on saturday and megan and beth's graduation party on sunday.  this will be a great weekend coming up i hope

      at allison's, apparently tiffany, monica, and sarah were talking about the fruits they were (i think corresponding to their body parts).  i came in right after they were talking about it.  monica was a pear, tiffany was an apple, and sarah was a banana.  and then monica said i could be an apple stem, or the core.  it was pretty funny.  i gotta go socialize.  i'm not really in the mood anymore.  i'm too tired to care or to talk or to think after this retreat.  i need to pray and sleep.  but my sister's having her going away party - she's going to germany wednesday!!  i'll write about that later tho

      what a nice night.  it started off kinda rocky because there was no place for the seniors to sit in the youth room (all the 8th graders took the couches!!) and then the underclassmen wouldnt shut up.  the slide show finally started and it was a nice trip down memory lane.  i didnt think i was gonna cry.  i was looking forward to the slide show so much more than graduation.  the slide show was awesome, though most of the pictures were from freshman and sophomore year.  monica had the most pictures and the best songs.  haha, mmbop came on and tommy wrote a message saying that he knew monica used to like it and so did everyone else.  that was really random.  i was like the third to last person on the slide show, and there were so many pictures from freshman and sophomore year... i just started crying.  youth group was my home.  pius was where i learned my faith, and these people helped me find God.  i remember freshman and sophomore year when every thursday was youth group day, and every thursday lunch all of us pius people would sit together and talk about how excited we were for youth group that night.  and then friday at lunch we'd all talk about how great youth group was last night.  haha that's why elizabeth called us pius brats.  and then we all started to grow up and move away from youth group.  i guess that's how its supposed to happen.  we depended on youth group in the beginning, but then we were able to take what we learned and distanced ourselves from youth group.  plus we all got so busy.  i think i was there 3 times junior year and maybe 5 times the first half of this year.  i'm so grateful for youth group.  it gave me something to look forward to and it was most definitely my home away from home.  the pius girls i grew up with are my family.  leeann and ben from preschool, jackie and erin from first grade, and monica.. i've just known her my whole life.  we've had some great retreats, from camp maria to camp letts, and i've met some great people like kelly cahill.  after the slide show we played trainwreck.  people get so into it and we were definitely beating each other up.  it was awesome.  i'm gonna miss leigh pushing me out of the way and giving me bruises.  we are all so violent.  i'll never forget youth leader with leeann and monica.  we bonded a lot through that experience.    i really want to finish my senior book tonight.  at least most of it.  and then i need to write thank you cards.  i have to clean tomorrow too.  and pack.  all before 5pm.  hmm, i guess i cant stay up too late because i also will need to go outside since everyone is home on friday.  that sucks a lot.  but at least there's a retreat this weekend.  i need to call yvonne.  i want to talk to her a little before she heads off to texas for 2 weeks.  that is a long time and i'm gonna miss her.  i want to see jessie doerrer so badly.  monica saw her at some random gas station in bowie - i wish i could run into her.  i just want to see her and give her a huge hug.  i think when i see her i'm gonna cry.  she's been such a major part of my life and i owe her so much.  without her, i wouldnt have experienced 9am mass at pius and i probably wouldnt have appreciated mass in general or my faith as much as i do today.    anyway, i'm gonna go work on my senior book so i wont stay up til 3 again tonight.  plus, i'm crossing my fingers for that BIRC scholarship.  mr. bill blackford seemed to like me, so i hope he gives me that $1000 :)

      last night i stayed up til 3 working on my senior book.  that was nice.  i'm not done yet though.  i got my graduation pictures back today but i dont like half of them.  oh well.  its all good cuz senior night is tonight!!  i'm excited to spend tonight with my pius friends - i hope nothing happens at home to ruin my excitement.  i'm nervous about my interview for the BIRC scholarship though.  i would love to get it.  i bet its only $1000 but i really dont care.  one thing that concerns me right now is my appetite.  i dont have one.  i've eaten one thing today and its almost 6pm.  i can tell that i'm hungry and i need food, but i dont have any desire to eat.  and we actually have food that i like, such as cake, at home.  i've noticed this recently.   i think it has something to do with me not being happy, but i dont know.  i'll pray about it tonight.    i have to go shower, drop my siblings off at pius, go to the interview at grace baptist, and then rush to youth group.  i better not miss the slide show, even though i've seen all the pictures since tommy and mark used all of mine from the walls

      i am pissed off right now.  tell me why my mother told me it was MY fault that i fell on the concrete when playing football sophomore year.  like i WANTED to fall and get a concussion and have headaches 24/7 for over 2 1/2 years.  she talks like i asked michael bonnucelli and all of his 300 or 400 pounds to trip over me and fall on top of me and split my head open.  does she think i wanted attention?  yeah, i wanted to undergo extraordinary pain to get attention from an ambulance. i mean, whenever i see michael or his mother or his sister at pius or even pass by the his section (which i do everyday since its right next to the y section) i relive that night.  what the hell.  i'm shaking and crying and i cant stop.  living with a headache has been hell.  i dont know how i've lived with them and accomplished all i have.  i was honestly having an ok day, and i was even happy because i got to sit with monica, ben, and erin during graduation.  why would she say that???  why would she even bring it up??  i held back my tears at dinner and now i cant stop crying.  i bet she thinks i wanted to get in a car accident too.  AND NOW MY MOTHER"S SENDING ME ON AN ERRAND.  WHAT THE HELL.  she causes me so much pain with a few words and then asks me to do crap for her. i love how i can put on an act.  i've learned how to act happy when i'm nowhere near it.  i stopped shaking and crying for 10 minutes and put a fucking smile on my face and had a "nice" conversation with someone.  i dont know if its a good thing that i can do that.  i do that with my family all the time though.  i do it all the time for plays.  but i'm like that almost all the time at home.    i know i'm sensitive to anything regarding people talking about my headaches, especially when they try to downplay them.  i want those people to experience constant headaches, which worsen whenever anything happens (which is all the time because of stress, lack of sleep, etc), for 2 1/2 years straight, and then they can talk to me about my headaches.  maybe i'm oversensitive.  but dealing with my headaches has been a constant struggle and a lot of times i feel like giving up and cutting my head off or something.  it seems easier than dealing with it..  i dont want to kill myself or anything.  i just want the headaches to go away.  and i want to leave home.  they dont care about me.  they dont care about the pain i deal with.  whatever.  i dont need them and i'm going to indiana in 3 months.    anyway.  today was alright until dinner.  i woke up at 10:30 and then watched a couple episodes from the real world chicago.  i love that season and i'm glad i was able to tape half of it during some random marathon before the airing of real world paris.  i went outside for 2 or so hours after my siter woke up and my mom and brother came home.  then i worked on my senior book, dropped off graduation film, bought new sugarcult cd, went to starbucks, worked on my senior book again, and showered before i went to jim's graduation.  too bad it was at least 2 hours long.  but it was ok because i sat with ben, monica, and erin, and they are funny people.  and listening to my old principal at st. pius, mr. bob love, was hilarious.  he talks just like a president of the US, meaning he's bad at it, and his inspirational words for the graduates were, "you're not as smart as you think you are" and "as long as you have breath, you can learn." haha i'll always remember him as the guy who said, "let's have a good day" in the silliest way every morning on the pa.    funny quotes of the evening: "jesus does the stomach good" -erin lorenz "i liked how parents were filming their children receiving communion" - me "out into the real world [high school] we go" -ariel (she gave a testimonial to catholic education) "now the catholic faith is flourishing at a most rapid pace" - ariel "it is?" - erin "that's like ben saying in my just world video that crime has steadily increased over the past...20 years in a response explaining why the death penalty does not deter crime.  he made it up!" -me "high school is NOT the real world" - me "my dad took a picture of eileen as she stood up" -erin "no applause as we dispense the diplomas" -lady who announced kids' names "we have to holler as eileen goes up!" - erin lorenz  so graduation ended, and thankfully my mother only took 2 pictures, and she suggested we go out to dinner.  that sounded great at the time cuz i was starving beyond belief.  but i forgot that when we go out to eat, we are forced to talk.    there were a lot of uncomfortable silences, and once my brother ended the silence by semi-dancing, shaking his head up and down, and singing "tipsy."  my little brother was singing about getting drunk at a club.  he's been doing that a lot lately.  and on the way home he sang along to "toxic" by britney spears and kept talking about his crush, chelsea, and how she's coming to youth group tomorrow.  tonight i fully realized that he is a teenager.  anyway, at dinner, elizabeth suggested that jim play football tomorrow at youth group.  and then my mom said that comment about my concussion.  i really need to stop shaking.  i didnt talk the rest of dinner.  i had coffee and i was ready to go.  (oh yeah, coffee twice in one day is GREAT, and now i have 150 dollars in starbucks giftcards, so i can get coffee almost every day this summer for FREE.)    before dinner i was excited to get home and work on my senior book and either talk to jessie or write her an email.  but she ruined my happiness, of course.  i'm spent.  i honestly thought after i got out of school it would all be good.  i would be able to be happy again.  but of course i was wrong.  i'm never able to be happy in my house.  that's why i'm so excited to move out to indiana.  i'm not nervous at all because i know i'll be so much happier there.   and to top it all off, i have to move in to my sister's room.  thank goodness she's going to germany for 2 months and she's leaving next wednesday.  i would not be able to live with her - i cant deal with it   song i'm listening to now: "Keep your head up The colors are beautiful When they say give up Turn up your radio All the sentimental memories you own When they say grow up It’s just like a funeral  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful Keep your head up It’s all right in front of you When they say wake up You’re braking ridicule When all the sentimental memories you own  Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone  And it feels like It feels like you’re lost And it feels like It feels like you’re lost  Is there some way you can be out on your own? Trust yourself Don’t waste another day at all" - sugarcult  maybe working on my senior memory book will cheer me up.  leeann is doing a nice job at keeping my mind off all the crap.  i think i'm more than halfway done.  its turning out nicely, and its not even that thick.  i dont want it to be extremely think, so i need to go out and buy a scrapbook so i can include pictures from freshmen through junior year, plus extra ones from senior year as well as notes and stuff like that.    "nobody can save me, nobody can say what i'll do when i'm alone, sign off" -sugarcult

      i told myself a million times i wouldnt cry.  i'm not sad to be leaving seton and most of the people.  i dont even think i cried because of that.  baccalaureate...it was a waste of my time.  i was definitely surprised at some of the awards.  why the hell am i crying now?  maybe because of my family.  i remember elizabeth's graduation.  it was a lot happier than this....i just feel like no one is proud of me.  i feel like i worked so much harder than my sister during high school but my family doesnt even care.  they love elizabeth and jim, but not me.  and i'm tired of it.  this day is supposed to be great and happy, and i'm sitting here alone.  my family almost didnt come to baccalaureate.  at this point i didnt even want them to.  i dont want them to pretend to be happy for me and proud of me when i know they're not.  i remember counting down the days til june 1, but now i just want it to be over.  i'm ready to get on with my life and continue friendships with those people i want to.  and tiffany can't come to graduation because kyra still has a fever.  i know its not her fault or anything, but tiffany has been more of a mother to me than my own mother the last 4 years.  i know that tiffany is extremely proud of me and is excited for me.  and i really appreciate that she's still going to go all the way out to my grandparents for a half hour or so just to see me on my graduation day  i love jessie doerrer a lot.  when i came home there were flowers and a card.  she wrote me the nicest note and it made me realize how much i miss her.  i wish she could come to my graduation, but i never got in touch with her.    anyway, its starting to hit me that i'm not gonna see certain people everyday next year.  who would have thought that i'm gonna miss laurice so much?  i know i wouldnt have because i never really got to know her during volleyball.  i thought she didnt like me for a while.  but i've gotten to know her so much better this year, and i loved ballet class.  i'm just gonna miss her a lot.  and it made me sad to hear her say she thinks she's only gonna stay in touch with one person from seton.  i love her a lot.  and yvonne, i think i'm gonna miss her most of all.  i know i'm gonna see her this summer - i will make sure of it (especially since we have to frolic at allen's pond sometime).  but i love her so much and she's inspired me ever since i met her.  i'm gonna miss seeing her tension dance and her yelling at me to stop spazzing.  i'm just really going to miss seeing her every day.  if i cry today about leaving anyone, i would be crying about her.  i know i'm gonna see my pius friends all the time, this summer and next year.  but yvonne, i'm not really sure, especially about next year.  i'm definitely gonna stay in touch though.  and i'll always have her blog.  she always knows how to make me laugh, and i'm gonna miss that a lot!    i need coffee.  i need to stop crying and i need to forget about my family and focus on my friends.    again, i'm listening to memory by sugarcult on repeat and i dont think its helping me  i've barely eaten anything today, and i'm about to drink a lot of coffee.  i cant wait til dinner.  there will be some good food there.  and i really dont want to cry.  i might knowing tiffany and jessie are not there.  and about missing certain people.  but i'm glad i'm sitting next to diana.  she keeps me sane when sharde and danielle douglas-jones just wont SHUT UP

      so....&nbsp; i actually feel really sick (like throw uppy kind of sick) and my head is pounding sooo hard, but i am in a good mood on the inside.&nbsp; i had a realization tonight.&nbsp; i knew it before, but i never thought about it too much.&nbsp; i realized tonight how much i missed play practice with the parks' and all my friends and all the little kids.&nbsp; i realized how much i LOVE being with all my pius friends (monica, leeann, jackie, allison, erin).&nbsp;&nbsp; they're all so wonderful.&nbsp; i'm blessed to have them in my life.&nbsp; they give me such confidence in myself, they help me love myself.&nbsp; tonight was so wonderful.&nbsp;&nbsp; leeann is absolutely the best wizard of oz.&nbsp; i know i've said some crap before, but i didnt mean it.&nbsp;&nbsp; my life feels so much better now.&nbsp;&nbsp; college is so soon, and while i'm ready to pack up and leave, i know i am going to miss being around these wonderful pius kids.&nbsp;&nbsp; leeann is and always has been my inspiration, my role model.&nbsp; i've always looked up to her, she's the reason why i had the confidence to get so involved with school.&nbsp; i love her to death.&nbsp; everyone loves her, and i know why.&nbsp; she's just a wonderful person.&nbsp; she's outgoing, passionate, dedicated, everything i want to be.&nbsp; i admire her&nbsp;so much for taking calculus and english.&nbsp; i know it was hard for her and i know how hard she worked.&nbsp; she put in so much effort, and i dont know if i could have given 200% like she did 24/7&nbsp;for the whole year.&nbsp; &nbsp;i think what i'm gonna miss most about her is her laugh.&nbsp; oh man, that laugh.&nbsp; just when you think she's done and she apologizes for her outburst, she busts out laughing even more.&nbsp; she brings such joy into the room when she laughs like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; i'm so glad she's going to rutgers though.&nbsp; i know she wanted it and she deserves it.&nbsp; i hope to see one of her regattas.&nbsp; she's going to have such an awesome time in college.&nbsp; jackie.. what can i say.&nbsp;&nbsp; she is absolutely crazy and i love it.&nbsp; i think i said a while ago that i feel like i dont know jackie since she's always happy.&nbsp; i was just not in a good mood when i said that.&nbsp; in actuality, i appreciate her being happy all the time.&nbsp; if i'm not in a good mood, i may get annoyed.&nbsp; but when people are happy, you know they are enjoying life.&nbsp; i know jackie loves life.&nbsp; i know i can go to her if i ever need to laugh, she can be so silly.&nbsp; i love the crazy jackie who gets drugged up on medication and coffee, what a great combination.&nbsp;&nbsp; jackie is amazing.&nbsp; i know she's gonna have a great time at college park next year.&nbsp; thats where she wants to be, she got in the living learning program she wanted.&nbsp; she's gonna do so well there.&nbsp; she really is smart.&nbsp; she can be blonde at times, but jackie is so intelligent.&nbsp; not that i doubted it, but she took on a lot this year with ap gov and ap english and ap stats.&nbsp; and she succeeded in all of them.&nbsp; i am so proud of her.&nbsp; allison.. i never thought i was that close to her.&nbsp; but i love her and i truly enjoy her company.&nbsp; she has had a lot of obstacles in her life.&nbsp; i'm glad she's in a wonderful relationship with brendan because i know that makes her happy.&nbsp; allison can put me in such a good mood.&nbsp; she'll just blast the music in her car and dance all crazy to country music.&nbsp; i love it.&nbsp; i am going to miss her next year.&nbsp; erin... too cool for words.&nbsp; i found this note from her from like 8th grade..&nbsp; it was so cute.&nbsp; erin is such a sweet person.&nbsp; she's sooo hilarious without meaning to be.&nbsp; i'm glad i had advisory with her the last two years.&nbsp; she made it so much more enjoyable.&nbsp; she's extremely creative and willing to help whenever needed.&nbsp; overall, i love my friends more than they'll ever know.&nbsp; they've helped make me who i am.&nbsp; i may complain sometimes, but i think that has more to do with prolblems within myself or my family or whatever than them.&nbsp; next year one thing i really am going to miss a lot is hanging out with all five of them.&nbsp; tonight and last friday at erin's grandmother's pool made me realize that.&nbsp; i knew i would miss them, but its beginning to hit me how much.&nbsp; and i'll have to say goodbye to jackie and monica a week early.&nbsp; that SUCKS.&nbsp; they've all been there for me whenever i needed it, and i appreciate them.&nbsp; i love them all to death.&nbsp; i hope they know that.&nbsp; and if they dont, i will make sure they know it before i leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; alright, i really need to go.&nbsp; but today was awesome.&nbsp; i loved seeing the pickering girls and hanging out with them and monica at the pool.&nbsp; going to play practice&nbsp;was so wonderful also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to leeann and jackie was great!&nbsp; i miss seeing them a lot.&nbsp; i was glad to buy everyone coffee and i'm glad they all enjoyed it.&nbsp; i'm so tired, and i still dont feel well so i'm gonna go to bed soon

      first, lets start with the good stuff... i now have money in my wallet (as of 4pm this afternoon, i was carrying around $6 worth of quarters..), i talked to yvonne tonight (she actually called me two nights in a row and we actually got in touch with each other!), i swam for 2 hours and 15 minutes today (except&nbsp;i loved how i got my period during my last laps of swimming), i got ashlee simpson's cd and i love it, i'm excited to hang out in florida with allie and to spend a whole week with monica in cape cod, and most of all i leave for notre dame in less than a month and i cannot wait for august 20th!&nbsp;   but now, i'm wondering why leeann and jackie talked to megan about me and why they are worried about me.&nbsp; i honestly cannot think of why they would be concerned about me...&nbsp; if they talked to megan rather than coming straight to me, it must have been serious.&nbsp; but how could it be serious and i dont even know about it.&nbsp; and then megan told tiffany and leigh, so they were talking about me "over a beer" on thursday night.&nbsp; leigh truly sounded like she didnt know what was wrong though.&nbsp; i hope leeann and jackie come to me.&nbsp; i dont worried them worried about me, especially when i cant think of what they'd be worried about.&nbsp;   i really wish i could have been in the play.&nbsp; i mean, i know florida will be nice and all, but i'm not close to shannan at all, and i feel out of touch with some of my friends.&nbsp; when leeann's not working, she's at play practice basically.&nbsp; same with jackie and monica.&nbsp; all of their nights are occupied, which means i sit at home and watch tv or something.&nbsp; i am excited to see yvonne though.&nbsp; i have to make that work next week.&nbsp; maybe wednesday night.&nbsp; that means i need to get her birthday present made.&nbsp; yeah maybe i should get moving on that one.&nbsp;  i also need to call my roommate.&nbsp; my dad said i might have a single, but i'm hoping its a quad.&nbsp; i would love to have two people in one room, two people in another room, and have the middle room as a community room.&nbsp; that would be AWESOME.&nbsp; i do not want a single.&nbsp; anyway, i dont want to call my roommate until i find out our situation, so hopefully i'll get emailed back tomorrow.  i have so much crap to buy for college.&nbsp; there goes approximately $2000.&nbsp; all my graduation money plus all this money i've been saving up for the past 5 or 6 years or something.&nbsp; and that money isnt including all the money i'm gonna be spending on football tickets, nd clothes, and books..&nbsp; i'm so grateful that i've never wasted money when i was younger and i saved it.&nbsp; let me make a list of what i need to buy: laptop and printer digital camera tv with vcr/dvd player cell phone and new plan blank cds, big and little cd case fridge and cordless phone?? desk lap towels thingy to put shower stuff in school supply stuff (paper, pens, pencils, wite out, stapler, scissors, tape, glue, markers, rulers, index cards) laundry detergent batteries backpack cheap plates, bowls, utensils masking tape medicine and band-aids volleyball pictures, scrapbooks, posters, cds, dvds, videos raincoat, umbrella CALCULATOR (i swear i'm gonna forget about that one)  and i'm sure i'm forgetting some more stuff....  "somebody listen please it used to be so hard being me living in the shadow of someone else's dream trying to find a hand to hold but every touch felt cold to me living in a nightmare a never-ending sleep" -shadow, ashlee simpson  this is how i feel now, sort of, and how i grew up.&nbsp; i can definitely relate to being the middle child and younger sister.&nbsp; not so much that my sister has&nbsp;a career that i want to pursue also.&nbsp; i'm completely different from her and i make it a point to be completely different.&nbsp; she just gets everything.&nbsp; love, respect, trust, etc, etc.&nbsp; what did i do?  "but now that i am wide awake my chains are finally free" -shadow, ashlee simpson  anyway, this is how i'm gonna feel when i go to notre dame.&nbsp; i am super excited.&nbsp;&nbsp; i cant wait to get away from the family that causes me so much pain and stress.&nbsp; one thing i love about yvonne is that she completely gets how much they have hurt me.&nbsp; i know that she doesnt like my family for that.&nbsp; not that i want people to hate my family.&nbsp; hate is such a strong word.&nbsp; but i know i dislike people who hurt my friends.&nbsp; yvonne comes right out and says that she dislikes my family.&nbsp;&nbsp; and i do love and appreciate her for that.&nbsp;   my mother's coming home sunday and my sister's coming home tuesday or wednesday next week.. wow june and july flew by.&nbsp; ewwww i'm gonna have to sleep in the same room with my sister again.&nbsp; for like 3 weeks.&nbsp; that sucks.  i should probably go to bed.&nbsp; tomorrow i really want to get yvonne's present all done now, along with some other people's...

       so... lots of stuff has happened.&nbsp; yesterday i got my ap scores which really brightened my day!&nbsp; three 4's in a row!&nbsp;&nbsp;i was like, whats going on, did they repeat the same score three times?&nbsp; but no, i actually got a 4 in english, government, AND calculus.&nbsp; and then i got a 5 in psych.&nbsp; WOAH!&nbsp; those scores definitely surprised me.&nbsp; english i am soo excited because i really didnt want to take comp101.&nbsp; or 110 or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i also got my hall information for orientation in the mail yesterday.&nbsp; there's so much stuff that weekend, from dances to ice cream socials to i dont know what else.&nbsp; it sounds like a lot of fun, unlike leah's orientation.&nbsp; oh yeah, that reminds me i really should call my roommate today or tomorrow at the latest.&nbsp; anyway, so i called yvonne last night at 8 because it feels like i havent talked to her in a while, and of course she didnt pick up.&nbsp; lol i think she goes to bed at 8,9ish, and i dont blame her because she's working.&nbsp; i was kind of tired of calling and not getting in touch with her, but then when i got up this morning and checked the caller ID&nbsp; (i was looking for my advisor's number at notre dame), yvonne had called me!&nbsp;&nbsp; at like 6:42, and i had gotten home at 7.&nbsp; too bad my brother didnt tell me, otherwise i would have called her back right away.&nbsp; i dont call her until 8ish just because i dont know when she gets home from work.&nbsp; oh well, i'll try and call her earlier tonight, except that holy hour is tonight.&nbsp; i dont know if i'm gonna go tho, because i dont know if i have a ride, and plus i dont know anyone there.&nbsp; i know kevin reagan, rudi, and fr tim.&nbsp; jessica walters was there last time.&nbsp; i wish jessie would go.&nbsp; ok, so the return key isnt working, so i'll just start another entry to talk about something else

      last night was my last real youth group ever... kind of sad.  the topic of the talk was death.  i'm so glad that tiffany asked fr. tim to speak.  the talk was 2 hours..  not so controversial since a lot of people werent there, but for a little bit it felt like the old talks we used to have during the good times of youth group.  i'll write more about it later, but for now, i need to find a ride to the pool since my dad is nowhere to be found

      i stayed up basically all night last night.  i was so hyper, the coffee was strong, and i was in a cleaning mood, though i was too tired to clean.  i took a half hour nap or something at 6:30, and when i woke up, i was still happy, but it figures that my dream also made me sad.  i dont really know what was going on, it was something scary at the end.  but when i first started the dream, i saw jessie.  i hadnt seen her in a long time and she gave me the hugest hug ever.  i love her hugs.  she's like my big sister.  i really think she's my family.  my family doesnt touch at all.  i dont remember the last time i hugged anyone in my family.  anyway, the beginning of my dream was nice until i woke up, because i really havent seen jessie in a long time and i miss her A LOT!  i dont remember when i saw her last... maybe she'll come to the holy hour thing next tuesday and we could talk after.   i dont know  but anyway, right now i feel sick to my stomach.  i didnt have an appetite at all today.  allison told me something today that made me so upset and pissed me off.  i dont even want to be on this computer right now.  apparently my brother is into porn.  WTF??? he's 14!  i think what makes me most upset about it is just that i didnt expect it.  i'm so naive.  i dont understand how people could like that and i never thought that my brother would get into it.  i never thought there would be porn in my house.  i think its because he plays those stupid computer games with people who have not so good morals... i hear some of the crap they say.  and jim hanging out with people like frannie and jeff at summer camp doesnt help anything.  why the hell would they talk about porn and possibly look at it while there are kids from age 5 to 13 there??  and to top it all off, my parents dont seem to care.  at first my mother acted like she belived me and she was concerned, but two seconds later, she kept saying stuff like, "its not uncommon, so its not a huge problem."  and apparently my dad is supposed to talk to my brother, but he has yet to do so.  PLUS my brother is still on the computer whenever he's home.  you'd think my parents would be concerned enough to put a lock or something on the computer.  am i overreacting?  i am completely grossed out and disgusted.  porn is so degrading.  my mom was like, "its a boy thing; boys will be boys."  whatever.  that is not an excuse and porn is gross!!  i dont even want to look at my brother right now.  and to think, i bought him mcdonald's today since he was too lazy to make himself a lunch.  i am pissed off at him and i cant wait til i get my computer - he WILL NOT touch it.  I CANT WAIT TO MOVE OUT!  i will never go home.    i got my nine rolls of film developed today.  my money is slowly slipping away.  i guess the pictures were good, but i wasnt in the mood to look at them.  i got photo albums that i need to decorate and stuff for people's graduation presents.  i think i'm gonna go upstairs and clean and listen to ashlee simpson's cd.  i love it.  i got a text message today from kadie while i was sleeping.  that was nice.    i feel so dirty.  i need to take a shower, i need to shave my legs.  i need to get all the crap out of my room and into my sister's room.  i just want to be done with it.   yeah i'm gonna go do that now

      listening to: a lot of accoustic stuff, like beth's mixes for me, graduation mix, goo goo dolls, stuff from sessions at aol.com.... its hitting me hard how much i miss being around certain people.  tried calling yvonne 3 times tonight.  i'm assuming she's sleeping or just isnt in the mood to talk.  i want to write her an email tonight.. i dont want to annoy her by calling her or anything.    after i didnt get in touch with her the first time, i put the mix beth made for me and 2 other cds into my sister's cd player and climbed on my bunk bed and laid there for a while just thinking.  then i got out my yearbook and a notebook, and after looking through the yearbook for a couple minutes, i started planning graduation presents.  thats gonna cost me a lot of money, but its really important for me to make these things so people know how much they mean to me and how much they've impacted my life and how much they've taught me.  i made a list first.  its pretty long, 20 people or so.  its funny... it was a lot easier for me to think of things to make for people like stefanie, beth, and kadie than for erin, jackie, allison, and leeann.  monica and yvonne were no problem at all, i have a page of stuff to do for them.  i love jackie, allison, erin, and leeann, but i'm beginning to wonder if the only reason we were really friends was because we went to school together for 12,15 years.  i dont even remember meeting them, since i met all of them except allison when i was 3 to 6 years old.  i guess it makes sense that the two people i'm closest to right now were the people i had to work to be friends with.  i never went to school with monica until sophomore year, yet i was friends with her basically my whole life.  we had sacred heart, gymnastics classes when we were really little, ccd for a couple months in 8th grade and confirmation, and then youth group starting summer after 8th grade.  and yvonne... she was in my advisory freshman and sophomore year, but i dont really remember her from that because she was in the back and i was in the front and then i left.  i dont remember classes with her really til junior year.  and basically junior and senior year i had all my classes with her except one or two.  at this point i feel closer to her right now than with leeann and allison and erin and jackie i think because i had to work to become friends with her this year.  not like elementary school friendships.  i had to reach out and make an effort to learn more about her.  and i'm glad i did it.  anyway, i love all my pius people, but i miss monica and yvonne so badly right now.  i feel so out of the pius loop partly because of the play (i'm very upset i couldnt be in it...), but i think mostly because they all seem so close or drifting away from me.  and at this point i'm ready to just go to notre dame.  i was reading yvonne's blog tonight and i completely understood everything she was saying about anticipating college and wanting to learn.  i'm actually excited to take classes next year.  i'm tired of worrying about money and trying to get a job again and being here in bowie.  i'm sooooo sick of bowie and my family.    beautiful song: "The stars will cry The blackest tears tonight And this is the moment that I live for I can smell the ocean air And here I am Pouring my heart onto these rooftops Just a ghost to the world That's exactly Exactly what I need  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat Cause I never Never have before  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day" - anthem of our dying day, story of the year  i'm really ready to go to florida and hang out with allie (my favorite cousin ever) for one of the last times for a while (i WILL take her out to starbucks before i go to notre dame...), then go to cape cod with monica, and finally pack up and leave bowie and move into notre dame!!!!!!!  i live for august 20th when i move in.  and i'm excited cuz i know sam and marissa will definitely visit me, i want to get to know linda kamen again (haha i remember me and elizabeth fighting over her attention when we visited them in ohio), and i hope monica and yvonne will come visit me (and then they can pick out the hoodies they want).    this week i'm going to attempt to hang out with people, drink lots of starbucks, do most of my graduation presents, and completely move into my sister's room...  i think i miss yvonne so much today because i went to allen's pond and she wasnt there (not that i expected her to be there, but it was too late to call her and my parents wouldnt have let me get her anyway).  i havent seen her in over a month.  i talk to her every couple of days, and i know that's good and all, but i miss her a lot.  i've said that so many times.  i just want to see her.  for a whole day.  or even half a day.  that would make me happy for a year and a day.  i guess i can make her bday/graduation present so i have a physical reason to see her.  i dont know.  i want to see her as much as possible before i go to notre dame.  i wish she was going there with me.  i know how badly she wanted to go.    thats enough for now.  bug juice is on in 4 minutes, hopefully a new season will start.  at 11:30 i will write yvonne an email, as well as a couple other people who i miss...

      i miss so many people.  i feel alone right now.  and i just saw a bunch of great people last night.  kadie sent me the greatest text messages ever.  i'm so glad to 'talk' to her, and i will definitely call her soon.  i want to see her.  i feel so disconnected from everyone right now.  i want to see yvonne more than anything, i havent talked to monica like all this week, and the rest of my pius friends are doing their own thing.  erin's working 24/7 and so is jackie usually during the week.  leeann is also always working.  i wish i were working.  maybe then i wouldnt feel so lonely.  i think tomorrow i'm gonna go to the pool to swim and tan, and then i'll just spend the rest of the day at allen's pond.  i'll bring my cd player and my book for notre dame and i'll relax away from my house.  i can never truly relax at my house.  i want to just move out and go to notre dame.  but then again, i feel like i'm not taking advantage of my time here.  maybe if i were out of my house more i would enjoy the rest of my summer.  i have so much stuff to do before florida but i dont feel like doing it.  i wish a computer and cell phone (and plan) and tv and everything else i need would just magically appear.  i wish i had a car all the time, and then i could go see the people i want whenever they are free.  tonight i'm gonna stay up late and listen to music and clean my room.  i've put it off long enough and it needs to get done.    but anyway, i really miss people.  a lot.  its weird but i dont miss the pius people as much as others.  maybe its just cuz i know they're around bowie.  i dont know.  but i definitely miss being around people like yvonne, kadie, beth, leah, brittany, ali, megan, stefanie, molly, camille....  i sent leah an email like 2 weeks ago, but she hasnt replied.  it took her that long to reply to my first one, so i dont know.    oh yeah, so amanda got her ap scores back and guess what she got?  5 on calculus and 4 on government.  woohooo gooooo amanda!!!  i'm not really surprised but i am proud of her.  i dont feel so confident about my government score.  i would love to get a 4, but i'm not counting on it.  i'll probably get a 2.. but its cool cuz i didnt put a lot into that class.  i mean i worked hard but not consistently or anything.  i think i read only 2 chapters out of the entire book.  psychology i think i should definitely get a 4, calculus i'm hoping to only get a 3 because i dont want to take a really hard calculus class at notre dame 1st semester, and english... well, i would die if i got a 4 or 5.  i would be shocked since i dont think its gonna happen at all.  i just dont want to take comp101 at all.  but it'll all work out in the end i'm sure.  i still need to send my scores to notre dame... i better do that tomorrow at the latest.    alright at 12:30 i'm gonna go work on my room. i dont even know where to start.  i dont have anywhere to put anything in elizabeth's room.  i guess i can just organize it to get everything ready to move into her room.  but i need to get a lot done tonight so i can go to the pool and allen's pond tomorrow.    i got my two bank accounts' statements today.  that made me happy.  i do have a lot of money, but i'll probably be spending half of the money in my actual account by the end of august.  apparently the kind of laptop notre dame wants me to have costs somewhere between $1500 and $2000...  i'm glad i started saving money when i was younger.  it definitely helps now since i dont have a job.  the other account from the accident i want to leave alone during college.  i want to use it to buy a car or something.  or pay off my education since i'll be in debt forever.    listening to the calling and lifehouse.  makes me think of jessie who i also miss a ton.  she introduced me to these bands.  i dont even know what kind of relationship we have.  i've seen her like 2 times in the past 2 1/2 years.  i talk to her online whenever i can.  but she's never on for a long time.  i love her so much.. i miss how close we used to be.  when i heard that she and katie werent close anymore, i was SHOCKED.  hopefully i'll talk to her soon.  she's such an amazing person, i dont want to lose touch with her.    i still miss people.  maybe this week i'll make a bigger effort to hang out with everyone i want to because after next sunday, we're only gonna have one car so i'll either have to walk everywhere or ride a bike or something....

      so... the show was awesome!!  at least when no way josie was playing.  congratulations - they were good, if you like that kind of music.  i personally did not like them.  it was all screaming and i didnt even know matt was screaming words.  i thought he was just screaming.  but allison told me in the car that there were definitely lyrics to their songs.  whatever.  i was so happy to be there.  i love no way josie a lot, especially beth and megan, and it was nice seeing all those people.  i was in a writing mood but now i'm not.  i should probably go to bed because i have so much stuff to do tomorrow.  besides going to the pool for 4 hours (i hope!), i need to clean everywhere.  i need to clean my whole room and move into my sister's room, plus i need to clean all of downstairs.  and i need to make my family page.  but for some reason, i have this sudden urge to watch the last episode of real world chicago.  that might have to wait until tomorrow though.  i am kinda tired, and i have to wake up before noon.  i cant believe i slept in til 12 today.  i really wanted to get stuff accomplished before i went to the pool.  it didnt really matter much anyway cuz i didnt get a car until 1.  oh well.    though i had fun tonight, it helped me realize how ready i am to go to college.  i have so much stuff i need to do before then, but i really want to leave.  i want to go away and meet new people and stay in touch with the people i really want to stay in touch with.  this sounds mean what i'm thinking in my head, so its gonna stay there.  it was weird seeing shannon greer tonight.  she seems nice, but its funny how things change.  i remember playing at her house all the time.  no more thinking about pius days, i really didnt like that school or my experience there.  alright i'm super exhausted.  tomorrow if i dont get in touch with mrs. mccorkle i'm gonna go crazy.  i  dont know what to do and i need my money.  and apparently they have financial problems... there goes my ten dollars an hour i guess...  ok good night and FLOAT ON

      i think today i realized how fast summer is going and how little time i have left to do everything.  by the end of july, i need to have read that stupid book and answered the study questions, hang out with a bunch of people, make all graduation presents, buy everything i need for college, and make a lot of money.  plus, this week i need to clean my room out completely.  i also need to get in shape.  i'm very anxious to do that.    anyway, today i also realized how much i'm gonna miss hanging out with monica.  she's spent this whole week working and going to her beach house.  right after cape cod, she's going to california and thats the end.  its really sad to think about that.  i want to spend as much time with her as possible for now.  i dont want to invite myself to her beach house, but a couple weeks ago i saw her everyday.  and if she hadnt been working at glory days last night, i wouldnt have seen her for at least a full week.  its not that i depend on her and i NEED to hang out with her, but i know i will miss her a lot next year.    no way josie's last show is friday.  that is exciting.  i'm making a shirt just for them tomorrow.  i cant believe the band is over after friday.    yvonne's taking her driver's test tomorrow.  i'm very excited for her and i hope she gets it.    i'm very mad at the weather today though.  it was hot and very humid in the morning, but it was sunny and nice weather to swim in.  however, i didnt have a car and i didnt want to walk to the pool by myself (plus it was really hot out) and i didnt have a bike to use.  so i had to wait until my mother got home from work, but too bad she didnt get home til 3 and it started storming at 2.  but that was ok because i would just wait til the storm ended.  too bad that the storm didnt stop until it was too late to go to the pool.  ugh.  i need to swim.  i love swimming laps and i think its great that i found something fun for me to do to work out.  i really hate running, and now that i realized again how much i love swimming, i cant go back to it.  tomorrow hopefully the weather will be great and i'll get a lot accomplished in the morning and then i'll swim like 200 laps at the pool.  and then i'll get a lot more accomplished in the afternoon.  i watched the ashlee simpson show tonight and she said how much she really wanted to get in shape.  not because she thinks she's fat, but just to feel more comfortable about herself.  that's exactly how i'm feeling right now.  if the weather is bad tomorrow and i cant swim i am NOT going to be happy at all.  i want to work out every day for the rest of july.  thats my goal, so lets see if that really happens.    alright, i've got my schedule planned out for tomorrow so now i gotta go to bed since i have to get up at 7:15 to take my dad to work.  then i have a bunch of errands to run and stuff to do before i go to the pool

      today i babysat.  technically only from 8-10 then 2-4, but i got paid for the whole 8 hours.  woohoo 50 bucks!  and thats really the end of my job status.  i will be calling mrs. mccorkle tomorrow.  all day.  otherwise i will pick up yvonne and we will drop by that lady's house and get my money.    i was proud of myself because i went to the pool by myself at 12 and i swam 100 laps.  i would love to do that everyday, and i would love to swim for 2 hours straight everyday.  swimming is GREAT!  i love that i dont sweat and i feel like i could swim forever.  :)  it definitely helps me clear my head and its good exercise and its actually fun, unlike running.    today was busy though.  woke up at 6:45, dropped my dad off at work, babysat, dropped kids off at camp, went to the pool, picked kids up and brought them to pool, picked up brother on the way to pick up my dad, went to dematha to bring my brother to band, got dinner and picked up contacts with my dad while my brother was at band, got home at 6:50, left at 6:55 to go to holy hour at sacred heart, then met people at glory days after.  got home at 10:50, and now i'm here.  i really liked the holy hour.  God works in mysterious ways though.  i honestly do not want to go back to mass at sacred heart for a while, but i do want to continue going to this holy hour.  it reminded me of mass at the sarnelli house because of the music and all the youth and the atmosphere.  i didnt know anybody but fr. tim and kevin reagan, soon to be fr. kevin in 4 years (crazy stuff!!).  anyway, kevin sang.  a lot.  oh i love his voice so much.  he made me tear up.  his voice is beautiful, and i will always remember him singing my first summer going to 9am mass with jessie.  those were beautiful masses that helped build my faith.  i was extremely happy to hear kevin sing.  didnt really talk to him though.  too many people and i just sat in the church for a while when everyone else went outside.  then at glory days i didnt go with the sacred heart people since i didnt know anyone.  anyway, the talk was on confession.  how appropriate.  maybe i shouldnt be catholic if i cant understand this.  the priest addressed my question/thoughts: why do i need to go to a priest for confession when i can talk to God direcly?  he said its like medicine.  you cant just hear about the medicine to cure whatever you have.  a doctor has to give it to you.  he said you needed to hear someone (a priest) say that God forgives you to know that He does.  however, i dont agree with that at all.  maybe i just dont like confession and that blinds me to the good of it.  i feel like confession is great for some people.  but me, i've never had a good experience with it.  its never given me that feeling of peace that jackie and erin have told me about.  they hate going, but once its over with their glad they did it.  i've never felt like that.  i always despise going and i never feel good after.  i dread confession.  i realized tonight that its the hardest thing to do in my life.  if it makes me feel so awful inside why should i go?  but then i was thinking about sr. margaret telling me i should seriously consider being a nun.  how can i consider that when i cant even go to confession?  i'll get back to that in a minute, but first erin was tellling me tonight that confession is so hard for her because you have to reveal so much about yourself to a stranger.  i mean, even if you're friends with the priest, its still hard to reveal all that about yourself.  i think its even harder if you know the priest, like me with fr. tim.  that confession at the retreat was the most difficult thing i've ever done in my life.  and having the priest be fr. tim made it even harder.  i know its all secret and supposed to be nonjudgmental, but how can your opinion of someone not change if you know all that about them.  its human to do so.  anyway, i really will consider being a sister.  i think i could do the lifestyle and even enjoy it.  i love spiritual highs and i would love to serve at someplace like the sarnelli house 24/7.  but i'm not at a point in my life to make those kind of decisions.  i guess for now my options are just completely open.  i want to live life and try new things.  i want to go to notre dame and be happy.    i hope tomorrow is nice out.  i really want to swim for a couple hours (looks like i'll be walking to the pool though) and then just lay outside.  its extremely relaxing and i love listening to music.  plus, exercise makes me eat less.  well, not eat less because it makes me hungrier in the long run, but it makes me snack less.  i cant stand when i just sit on my butt and eat and eat and eat just because there's nothing else to do.  i do that a lot but i really want to start eating healthier.  i dont need my cholesterol to be high.  me and yvonne should go on a 'diet' together.  haha.  hers lasted what?  a minute?  i remember her telling me that she was going to go on a diet some softball game after elizabeth's birthday party, but she never really started.   she cracks me up.    i really want my dad to go to bed so i can watch the ashlee simpson show.  i love her music, i dont know why.  i dont know why i like that show either.  I MISS JESSIE DOERRER!  and a lot of other people. laurice's graduation present is definitely done and just sitting on a table.   i need to clean a lot this week.  plus read basically all of notre dame's website.  i need to buy a laptop, digital camera, and whatever else i need for college all before i go to florida.  maybe i should start making a list of what i need to buy.  PLUS i need to make everyone's graduation presents.  maybe tomorrow i'll just plan what i'm making for everyone.  we'll see how lazy i feel.  i have so much stuff to do and i'm procrastinating a lot.  i need to get down to business so i can fully enjoy august.  i'm very excited for cape cod.  for me, it wont be a family vacation cuz monica will be there!!  but after that she's going to california and i dont know when i'll see her after that.  oh man... i cant cry.  i will cry then, but not now.    thats it for now.  hopefully i'll get a lot done tomorrow... like GETTING PAID!  grrrrr

      it seems appropriate i guess that 7th heaven was all about drinking tonight.  i dont know if i am going to go back to the sarnelli house.  i wish i could just forget about it.  i wish i could just be naive again.  i honestly had no idea they were drinking or how much they had when i was talking to them.  next year should be interesting.  i wish i could erase wednesday night from my mind.  no matter what it tainted the sarnelli house at least a little in my mind.  i didnt like how father kevin denied everything.  at least be honest and admit that some people got drunk.  but whatever, apparently i was wrong to get upset about it.  i'll think about this later...  very glad to talk to yvonne tonight.  i was mad when i called at 8 but she didnt answer.   i figured she was on the computer, but too bad my brother didnt let me on til 9.  we talked online (then she put a stupid away message up randomly), and she sent me an email, and she's getting a car so she can take me to allen's pond woohoo!  i miss her.  i love talking to her because she makes me laugh so hard.  some of the things she says... i fall over laughing.  she is crazy but i love her!     DrgonFae:  hey  C0mplxsimplicity:  hey wasup  C0mplxsimplicity:  i wrote u  C0mplxsimplicity:  "dirt off ya shoulder"  C0mplxsimplicity:  whoop whoop  C0mplxsimplicity:  sigh  C0mplxsimplicity:  what about philly?

      i've decided.  and i'm going to the pool to swim laps and get tan again.  i just like laying outside.  it is very nice and relaxing.  i feel like i missed out on what could have been an awesome week even though i was there while everyone else had one.  but i'll talk about that later.  today was very good even though i had to get up early (8am).  i went with monica and her mom to their beach house, and it turned out it was a whole april family party.  the hammets and hagers were there, plus more relatives.  it was soooo great to be at the beach from 10 til 3:30.  the weather was very nice, not too humid or anything, and the water was warm.  beatrice and veronica are so cute and followed me and monica around everywhere.  jonathon, monica, and i took out a canoe for 45 minutes or so.  we are definitely pros.  not really but we had a lot of fun.  i cant wait to spend 3 days there with monica, erin, jackie, leeann, and allison.  if they take off work.  i hope they do, because it would be awesome to go from a friday morning to a sunday evening.  but we'll see what happens.    4th of july is tomorrow and i desperately want to go out and do something.  i DO NOT want to stay at home.  i want to go out and see fireworks and hang out with friends.  i still dont know if leeann is doing something.    anyway, about habitat... some people have said it was amazing.  i just didnt feel it.  it was fine and nice and all, but i think i actually liked last year better.  maybe because it was a day longer, maybe we seemed to bond more, maybe it was the first time so it will always be the best.  i mean, we didnt clean the house the entire time, so you would think it would be better than last year to begin with.  however, i didnt like how we were divided into 2 groups for half the time and how outreach worked out.  last year it was soooo amazing.  this year it sucked.  i liked that we were helping people.  but i didnt get the experience like last year.  i sat in a van for 2 hours.  if this outreach had been last year, what would i have written my college essay about?  i dont know.  i dont want to say the trip was bad.  it seemed very short.  it just wasnt amazing or anything for me.    random memories from habitat i will miss: "ice cream" trucks at 10pm and later, sugar free icey pops, running with leeann in the park and getting hit on, staying up all night with monica and jackie, listening to 98.1 - motown and classic rock, the beatles, the temptations, sugarcult, yellowcard, less than jake, some spanish station - while paining blue trim, ultimite trainwreck on concrete, me and monica singing our german song to bodo and thomas, just listening to denerick talk - he's hilarious, leeann's laugh aka cackle, south street (hanging out with ben and monica, seeing that boat spraying the red, white, and blue water, starbucks, the bowie aa wrestling t-shirt, getting "lost" on the way home from south street), the chapel, hearing gunshots at night all the time and calling them firecrackers to make ourselves feel better, being 'intimidated' by leeann, being leeann's buddy and being glued at the elbow, playing cranium and seeing people get so competitive that they got really angry (actually i'm not gonna miss that), long games of uno... and thats all i can think of for now.  some things i'm not gonna miss:  bodo driving when he's hungover, actually all the community members' driving, their "celebration," special dark utz pretzels (and i like how mark and jackie didnt even eat any of them)  i'm not in the mood to talk about habitat anymore.  not that i ever really was.    jackie just invited me to go to her house tomorrow around 5 and have a cookout and then see fireworks at allen's pond.  woohoo!  that will be nice.  fireworks in person two years in a row, amazing!  i'm exhausted so i'm going to bed.  i still dont know if i'm sleeping in my room on the floor or in my bed in my sister's room, but i guess i'll find out.
