      Every morning at 6 a freakin' clock AM my alarm goes off (it's a clock radio set to NPR - I get to hear how many car bombings there were in Iraq since yesterday...). Terri is usually already up (she's a morning person, one of those strange beings that actually wake up all bright-eyed and alert at six a freakin' clock in the morning) and immediately begins to ask me if I'm getting up to walk with her.  Sheesh.  I don't know about you, but I  hate  getting up early to walk 2 miles around our neighborhood. Yeah, I know what you're thinking - "It's good for you". Well, I know it's good for me.  Doesn't mean I have to actually  enjoy  it.  It's not the walking-part that bothers me, I actually do enjoy the time I get to spend with my wife first thing every morning.  It's the waking-up-part that I abhor.  See, I'm a bed rat (that's what my folks used to say when we were kids). I  love  sleeping in my big, cozy nest of a bed. Anyway, I'm wandering, back to The Walk.  So I stumble out of the sack (mind you I only have one eye open so far as it takes me a long time to become fully conscious), put my walking attire on, and stumble down the stairs to put on my shoes. Then it's out the door.  For those of you that don't know my wife, she's a  demon  when it comes to walking. She likes to walk as fast as she possibly can (I think this is because she wants to stay a couple of feet in front of me, I look pretty rough in the AM) without running.  And talk about chatty! It's a good thing she loves me, because I usually don't say much other than uh-huh a few times. Again, I'm not a morning person.  We have lots of huge mountains in our neighborhood, or at least they seem like mountains to me. See, in addition to being a bed rat, I'm also much happier sitting in my chair in front of the PC ( or on the couch watching the tube) rather than walking up the side of a huge mountain at 6 a freakin' clock in the morning - especially when there aren't any mountain goats to look at. Hmmm, come to think of it, I've seen a couple of dogs in the 'hood that could pass as goats. Why would someone want an ugly old goat-looking dog anyway...?  Here's the part that really makes me feel like a big, fat slob - After we get back from our walk, my wife then goes on another walk (she calls it her power walk) to get her  real  exercise.  I suppose that when I'm 81 and can still get around as well as I can now I'll thank her.  I guess once I bite the weenie I'll get all the rest I'll need.  I wonder if the After Life has a 6:00 AM...?   -- Ken

      If you are reading this then you must really be bored, or as big a computer geek as I am.&nbsp; Be that as it may, this is my Blog and I hope you get a little something from reading it (hopefully nothing that can't be cured...)   Feel free to comment on anything you see here - it's always a good thing to hear what other folks are thinking when they read this stuff (at least that's what they teach you in school).   -- Ken

      Back in the beginning of July a mockinbird began building a nest in the crepe myrtle tree in the front of our house, right next to our front room window. We couldn't figure out why it would be building a nest in the middle of summer, since we assumed that they did the baby thing in the spring (like everyone else).  The other day we noticed the mockinbird flying into the tree with worms and such in its beak, and then we heard the babies begin to scream for the food. We were very surprised to find three little hatchlings there!  This photo was taken from inside the house through the upper part of the window. I had to get a six foot ladder in there so I could get these shots.  These guys are all beak! Momma (we think its the momma, anyway) spends all day feeding these little guys, and they are growing fast. We think they'll be ready to fledge sometime next week.  Hopefully we'll be around when that happens...   urlLink    Those are some hungry babies!  urlLink

      Here's a screenshot of me and my pal George chatting via MSN, contributing to the downfall of AT&T. Of course I was shocked to learn that George had grown a goatee...    urlLink    Stupid grin, eh?  urlLink
