      Wow. Sorry I haven't written for a week. My bad. Things have been kind of busy and I have been sick. Well, still am. We did hike Mount Timpanogos last Friday and it was great. It really was a beautiful hike! I was expecting it to be long, but it was even longer than I was expecting. That was probably partly due to one person having a little bit harder time than the rest of us. I don't think her husband really informed her of what she was getting into. She was tough though, and we all made it. The scenery was gorgeous going up, and the view at the summit was quite amazing as well. If I was on my own I probably would have stopped and taken a lot more pictures. As it was, I still managed to get some good ones that I will try and post soon. I would post them now, but I'm not on my computer at the moment. Sorry.     We did have quite the experience when it came to coming down from the summit. Once you get to the top you can either go back down to Emerald Lake the way you went up, or you can slide down this glacier that leads right to Emerald Lake. Sliding down the glacier probably takes off about an hour of hiking time. And, of course, it looked like tons of fun (to us guys, anyway). So we decided to go that route. Well I tell you what, those girls were scared to death. I admit, it was quite daunting. It consisted of sliding on your back down this extremely steep slope for probably a couple hundred feet, (I'm not really good with distances) trying to avoid rocks all the while. Two guys went down first and they were fine. That left my friend Bryan and myself at the top with his wife and the wife of one of the guys that already went down. It was a long ordeal to try and get them to go down. Finally I said I would go first and then they could follow after and Bryan would come last. I went and had the time of my life. It was sweet, definitely a rush. After some time Emily finally came down, screaming all the way. She didn't know how to stop, but really wanted to stop, but wouldn't do what we told her to do to stop, so she didn't stop for a while. When she finally did she said her hands were all bloody. Well, it turned out that she got a little cut on her thumb and the blood had run all over her hand and looked a lot worse than it actually was. This was a good thing, since (as I found out at the bottom) one of the guys that went down in a group before ours had busted his elbow open pretty good and blood was gushing out. Nice. Anyway, then Diana went finally went down (it was actually an accident... she was just trying to get closer to the edge). When she stopped she was fine, physically, but emotionally she was a wreck. She was seriously hysterical for like 20 minutes. Whoa. It was crazy. Finally Bryan came down and ended up with a foot-long slash all the way down his back. Very nice. It wasn't too deep, but it looked pretty impressive.     Anyway, I don't even really feel much like writing write now. I started to feel sick on Saturday and it got worse and worse until Tuesday night when it was the pits. I was up all night and feeling miserable. Is there anything worse than being sick and tossing and turning all night long? It's at times like that when all you want is your mom. Anyway, I went to the store early Wednesday morning and hooked myself up with some Nyquil and Dayquil. Very nice stuff. I took some Nyquil and slept the rest of the morning and into the afternoon. It felt so good. Anyway, but today I am back at work again and wishing I wasn't. I had to work from 12-4 and now I am working the 5-9 shift. I took some more Nyquil a couple of hours ago and have been feeling okay, but struggling to stay awake. My body just keeps whispering sleep. It's a real struggle not to give in to its lulling. Sweet, sweet Nyquil induced sleep. So that's kind of why I am writing right now, to keep myself from nodding off into a peaceful slumber. I really just hope I get feeling better quick. I have too much to do to be sick! I'm getting behind on my marathon schedule, school, applications, MCAT preparation. Ugh. I just hate to think about it all.     I did meet a new girl this week. Her name is Taryn. She seems like a pretty nice girl. She works at an assisted living center and I've been trying to get our ward to start singing at such a place, so it works out perfect. She's going to help get us hooked up. We will probably start visiting over there on Sunday evenings. Anyway, I should get back to work I suppose.

      Today was a rather uneventful day. I didn't have to work until noon, so it was pretty nice to sleep in. I just remembered, I had a terrible dream last night! I dreamt that I got married to this girl. It was kind of a rushed thing and I guess I didn't really think about it a whole lot. But then all of a sudden we were married. It was done. And then I started thinking that I didn't really want to be married to her. It was a horrible feeling. I felt so trapped! I felt like I had messed up and there was nothing I could do about it... it was so final. Wow. What a huge relief when I woke up and realized that it was just a dream. Does this dream mean something? Do you think it reveals something about what I think deep down? Am I really scared of marriage and don't even realize it or admit it to myself? Am I&nbsp;afraid that I will mess&nbsp;up and marry someone that I end up not wanting to be with?&nbsp;I don't know. Maybe it was just a dream?  So I was walking to work just before noon and I saw this guy walking across campus and talking on his cell phone with the antenna up. I don't know why, but that is one of my pet peeves. It totally bugs me when people stick the antenna of their cell phone up. Does it really do anything? I seriously doubt it. I think they just look stupid. Now I don't want to speak to harshly because I know my Mom used to pull her antenna out, and she would feel really bad if she read this. But she has a new phone now, one that doesn't have an antenna you can pull out. So she's good now. Anyway, just leave the antennae alone people.   Work was fine today. There are certain people that come to the library and use the computers every day. I can't figure out what they are doing. No joke. This one guy was there today from 10:30 a.m. until about 6:45 p.m. That is not normal! These people aren't students either. It isn't like they are working on research papers or anything like that. They are older people that don't even have logins, so they just have to use the public access computers. I just can't understand how someone earns a living when they are sitting on computer at the library all day, every day.   After work I came home and went running. I went 5 miles in the rain, wind, lightning and thunder. It was pretty fun. There was some beautiful lightning while I was out there. I was actually getting kind of scared that I was going to get hit, but I just kept going. I've got a marathon to train for here!   Tomorrow we have no classes for pioneer day. Some of my friends and I are going to hike Mount Timpanogos in the morning. We're meeting at 5:30 a.m., so I should probably get to bed. I'll probably have some pictures to show from our hike tomorrow.

      Other than the breather, today was not too bad of a day. The fire alarm went off twice at work this morning. That was kind of nice. I finished transcribing one of the sessions, the one with Steve. Fourteen pages. Unfortunately when I got back to work after history class I was informed that Masha had accidentally deleted the whole thing. Ouch. So we get to do the whole thing over again. Of course I felt really bad because she felt so bad about it. Things were just not going well for her today. I actually saw her cry. I guess she did something wrong at the lab... forgot to give the cells sugar. So they haven't been growing for two weeks and now they are throwing them all away. She was pretty upset. That is one interesting difference between men and women. They cry so much easier than we do. I suppose they are just more sensitive than we are. I think it makes us love them all the more.  I played some softball tonight. Hadn't done that for a long time! It was actually pretty fun. Met this girl that lives in my complex who is from Staines, England. That's right, my old stake. Small world, huh? It was pretty fun to talk with her for a few minutes and remember. Man, I would love to go back and visit. Sometimes I really feel homesick for England.  We had a pretty good rainstorm roll through tonight. There was some nice lightning. Is there anything cooler than watching a huge, brilliant&nbsp;bolt of lightning streak across the night sky? If&nbsp;there is, then please tell me because I'd like to see it.

       urlLink    This guy man... I tell you what. Do you ever come across those people who breathe really heavy and loud? He is one of them. He came and sat next to me today in history and he kind of creeps me out. He has almost the same computer as I do and I think for some reason that is really cool to him or something. I don't know. But he just kept breathing on me and it was so loud! It was driving me crazy! And not only was it loud and obnoxious, it was also kind of stinky. Oh, it was bad. I didn't know if I was going to make it through class. He kept leaning on my arm rest really close to me too. Man, I wanted to just shove the guy and tell him to open his mouth and stop snorting through his nose. But of course I didn't. For some reason that would be socially unacceptable. Oh well. I survived the class period. I just hope he doesn't sit by me again next time.

      Well, here I am. Entering the world of blogging. What am I doing? I don't suppose anyone will ever read this, except perhaps my family. But that's okay, because I'm not doing it for people to read. I don't know what I'm doing this for, to be honest. Well, it gives me a place to post my thoughts anyway.  I'm sitting in the Wilkinson Center on BYU campus right now. Wireless internet is great. I'm listening to Counting Crows. I just got off work a little over an hour ago and came over here to get a bite to eat before heading over to the bus stop to go home. Teryaki Stix. Curry Bowl. It's about the cheapest thing that you can get that will actually fill you up. It's weird though. I usually eat as much as I can and then I get this funky stomach ache. Don't know what that's all about.  Anyway, I'm going to head home now and try to get some work done. I need to study for my history class. I need to study for the MCAT. I need to work on applications to medical schools. I need to run four miles. So much to do, so little time. So again I ask myself, why am I sitting here doing a blog? Who knows...

      It's me again. I am sitting in my bedroom listening to some music. It's Monday night, so we had home evening tonight. It was... interesting. We just kind of sat around and pigged out on junk food and then played a few rounds of catch phrase. Guess what I did tonight though? I finally submitted my AMCAS application for medical schools. Whoa. I'm really doing it. Really it is just the beginning of a very long process, but it is a big step in the right direction. I was pretty happy to get it submitted. A little less happy about the $520 that is cost to click the "submit" button. What can you do though?  I had a really fun weekend this past weekend. Friday night was okay. I had two receptions to go to. They were both from 7-9 and one was in Payson while the other was downtown Salt Lake. I managed to get to both of them. The one in Payson was my shelver friend April's. Cousin Tausha was the one in Salt Lake. That one was quite fancy. It was held on the top floor of the Wells Fargo building. 23rd floor. Very nice view of the city and the sunset. They had three chocolate fountains. That's right, three. As if one or even two wasn't enough. Two were brown chocolate and the third was white chocolate. Then on each end they had these big ice sculpture things that looked kind of like the fountains except they were ice and they put the fruit for dipping on the levels of the ice sculptures. It was nice. Cousin Tristan played his bass guitar while his teacher played on the grand piano. They sounded good.  Anyway, on to Saturday. I had another reception on Saturday (yes, that makes a grand total of 5 receptions from one Saturday to the next). But afterwards Ross and I went with Emily and Beth to the movies. We were planning on seeing Napoleon Dynamite, but it was sold out so we decided to see The Village instead. Very good choice. I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a great story. It was just scary enough, but not like I was going to pee my pants or anything. It is quite suspenseful though. But besides enjoying the movie, I really enjoyed my company. This Beth girl is someone that I have kind of been a little interested in for a little while now. She's cute and fun and is pretty mature, in spite of only being 19. She is probably more mature than I am in a lot of regards. So I really enjoyed spending time with her that night. She was fun. We laughed a lot and that felt so good. I haven't had so much fun in a long time.  Sunday I went to church and it was good. After church Ross and I went over to Emily's apartment for dinner. Among other people, Beth was there. Dinner was good. After dinner we played a game of nerts or nertz... I have no idea how to spell it. Pretty fun game. Then we went to sing at the retirement home, as we usually do on Sundays. I love visiting there; those ladies are so much fun to visit with. I think Emily, Beth and I are actually going to go back on Friday night and play games with some of them. To keep a short story from becoming long, I spent the rest of the day with Emily and Beth. We played another game of nerts and then went to ward prayer and then a whole bunch of people joined us for a big game of nerts. Beth and I were a team all night and, once again, I had a good time with her. She's a fun girl. When Emily took me home at midnight she questioned me, of course and I, of course, questioned her in return. Emily said she had fun on Saturday night too, so that's a good sign.  I am not ashamed to admit that I am pretty scared to even think about the possibility of getting into another relationship. I guess I've just felt my share of hurt and have kind of been trying to avoid any more of it. I have kind of distanced myself from girls this summer and so it is kind of weird to be thinking about it again. I realize, though, that I have to be willing to give it another shot. It might end up good, it might end up bad... who knows? But I can't just give up on girls; I have to keep trying. I will say, though, that I have no intention of rushing into anything here. Of course, I don't have a ton of time left in Provo... that doesn't mean I'm going to throw caution to the wind though. We'll just take it easy and see what happens. It seems like I always say this and don't always follow it, but I really think I will this time.  Anyway, I should get to bed. Classes finished today, but I still have my final on Thursday. Yay for finals.

      Sometimes we just need some peace and quiet. I really mean that. Maybe it would be better to call it quiet and peace, because I think the peace comes when it is quiet. I went to a wedding reception this evening with Masha. When I got home two of my roommates were not home; only Ross was here, and he soon went to bed. I came into my room and began changing out of my Sunday clothes and I sat down to take off my shoes. Then I just sat there. It was quiet. There was no T.V. on. There was no music playing. There was no roommate talking his head off. It was just quiet. And I sat there and thought about things. And it was peaceful and calming and relaxing. It really felt good.  I think it is really important to take advantage of those moments, as they seem to become more and more rare. It is important to take time to reflect on things and it just doesn't happen with noise. I think one of the mistakes I make is playing instrumental music or classical music, and thinking that that counts. Don't get me wrong, I think listening to that music is great, but I realized tonight that it does not beat silence sometimes. Silence really is beautiful in my opinion. Unfortunately, my roommate has come home now and has the T.V. on. Like I said, silence is rare. Mine only lasted about half an hour.  Anyway, what did I sit and think about? The reception, of course. What else? It was really wonderful. The bride looked beautiful and they just seemed so excited and happy and at peace. I always seem to think, when I go to these things, "why isn't that me?" You know what I mean? I often think, there's a really nice girl... I could be happy with someone like that, why am I still single and someone else is marrying her? I don't know if anyone else ever thinks like that, but it always seems to get me thinking.  The reception itself was really nice. Some things I liked about it: It was held the night before the wedding. There is definitely a different feeling when they are not yet married. They are not exhausted physically and emotionally yet. They are still full of excitement and adrenalin, as they are not yet married. They aren't sitting there thinking about (worrying about) what they are going to do as soon as they leave the reception. I also think there is some kind of feeling of sadness at receptions usually. It is kind of like, oh, they are married now and are moving on, leaving us. But the night before you aren't really feeling that yet. Again, it is just more of an excited feeling. Another thing I really liked was not that fact that they had a line, but the fact that it was only the two of them in the line. I didn't have to shake hands and make small talk with ten other people that I really don't even care to talk to. I mean, who really wants to talk to the parents and all of the bridesmaids? If you do, go find them and talk to them. Don't make everyone do it. Another thing was that they had this guy sitting at the keyboard playing and singing Ben Fold's Five, Counting Crows, and other music. Very nice touch. I loved it. It was fancy but there was just an informal feeling. We just had desserts, but they were really good. Mmm.  We left in a hurry because Masha was supposed to go to her Yoga class at 9.00 pm. Well, that didn't happen. There was this terrific thunder storm that hit us on our way home. It was spectacular! There was so much lightning flashing all around us, which was beautiful. Then the rains came pouring down in torrents. It was raining so hard that we could hardly even talk to each other without yelling. I could barely see where I was going at some points. We had to crawl along the freeway at about 20 mph. It was quite the storm. We enjoyed it.  I had a good time tonight. It was nice to spend some time out with someone. Even though it wasn't a date, it was just nice to go and spend time with someone that I don't normally do stuff with. Kind of refreshing.  Well, I am still kind of struggling with this sickness. I thought I was getting better but now I am  not so sure. I wasn't feeling to great today. So, I should probably get to bed now so that I can try and get over this.  P.S. I decided yesterday that I am not going to take the MCAT again in August. I just am not prepared and so it isn't worth it. It feels like a big load off my shoulders. If I end up not getting accepted anywhere, then I will just have to take it again in April, at which point I will be much better prepared, and apply again next year. So that's that.
