      after four weeks, somebody from the board talked to olivia  she's fine...i don't know the details of what's been going on the last few weeks, but i do know a few things....she has a cat now, and she loves it...she's got a new counselor...and she's still having trouble with her mom and boyfriend, so if you guys could pray for her that'd be great...but she seems to be happy, and at the very least she's home and safe...i'm so relieved...  her computer has had a virus for a long time, so it's been out of use for the last four weeks, which accounts for her absense  i'm glad she's alright

      i want to call you, i want to see you again...i'd love for another chance to talk to you, and spend time with you...i want to keep in touch with you...but i'm held back by fear of embarassment...or fear that maybe you won't like me as much as you did last time...  you'll never read these words...  and in six more days i'll never see you again...

      "...i used to be an authority on irony. "   "it's not so complicated to explain why these feelings faded. please pass some sanity, saint of mediocrity, and keep me out of my sobriety."   so i went to the movies with ben and zack last night...great time.&nbsp; i loved it.&nbsp; the movie was good...and it was good to have that hour-long conversation with zack afterwards...you know, those conversations where you just let out everything on your mind? yeah, those are so nice...i wish i got that more often..   "turning to drugs to help you sleep will only lead to sleep, and sleeping is a gateway drug to being awake again."   things are finally starting to look up in my life...i'm getting better dealing with certain things...and once i can deal with those&nbsp;i can move on to more important things in my life that need attention that i haven't been able to give them...   "and when the chopping is through, every piece will say 'i love you.'"   of course, life, being the way it is, will never be perfect.&nbsp; that's one of the things i'm learning to deal with   i guess i'll sum up my attitude right now with one more quote:   "right now i'm giving last rites to all my sleepless nights.&nbsp; right now i'm coming clean and i'm going on with my life.&nbsp; amen."

      Inside, it's so peculiar, everything feels so frozen and overgrown. I've seen ten thousand faces, but they'll never be the ones I've always known. And nothing feels the same when you're alone. No one knows how bad you've got it. Far away and long forgotten. No one knows that the roads seem cold wherever I go. I know that I'm old and alone until the day I come back home. Outside my breath is smoke as everyone waves goodbye to me on their way home. I smile like a best friend might, but I'll never be the one they think they know. And nothing feels the same when you're alone. Wide of the mark. It makes me sad.But grief like this is healthy when you've had the dreams I've had. No one knows how bad you've got it. Far away, but not forgotten. And the roads seem cold wherever I go. I know that the roads aren't cold back home. I know they're gold. I'm someone different now.
