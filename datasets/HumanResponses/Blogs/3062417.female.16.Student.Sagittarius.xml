      Cabaret was really fun last night. I love all of the commotion and performing for people. We made some mistakes but noone could really tell. Intermission was fun hanging out w/ a buncha people (Molly, Dave, Justin, Carol, Kim, Sarah, Kristen, and everyone else). I got home around 10:30 and I went right to bed I was so tired. Tonight should be better. I can't wait.  Well right now I'm looking up information on Jackie Kennedy, listening to Mest, downloading Rooney, and waiting my mom to get home for buying doughnuts so I can eat some! Suprisingly I'm awake for the lack of sleep I got last night. I just hope that lasts until tonight.  I wish I had a job so bad. There are so many things I want to buy. Here's a few: 1. Tons of new clothes 2. A pair of Vans that I like 3. A skateboard so I can learn on my own since it looks like Gavin won't be teaching me anymore 4. A car 5. insurance and stuff for a car 6. tons more stuff  Song:  What went on last night  Was it just another stupid fight  Will we be again  Or will we both regret this in the end  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Consider me your friend  Until you do that stupid shit again  I believed all you told  Then you left me hanging out so cold  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  -"Forget You"-Mest

      Last night was friggin awesome. I got free milk from the vending machine. (Milk comes out really easily when you shake it. Mine was cookie and creame and it was yummy. hehehe) Then I hung out w/ Molly, Justin, and Dave like the whole night. That was fun. I didn't get home until 11 though so that kinda sucked.  Today was good too. I had swimming for gym and water polo is funness. I had double lunch today too! And I hung out with Molly, Justin, and Dave, yet again. They are some cool kids. lol Then I had my fun study hall which I always love w/ Danielle, Carol, Kimmy, Ned, Kevin, and Beaner. They always make me laugh. My English project is finally moving along so I'm happy about that too. And as always Kim and Josh always make my bus ride home interesting. So overall my day was the best I've had in a long time.   Now I'm talking to Gavin, listening to AFI, and downloading Rooney. Later I have the first night of Cabaret. Everyone should come and watch us! I have to be there at 6:45 and it doesn't start until 7:30 so I'll get to hang out w/ all my friends again like last night. It should be a ton of fun. I can't wait. Then tomorrow I'm going to Kayla's house to film my AP project so that should be interesting. Then the last night of Cabaret! I'm gonna be so bored when this week is over. I'm not gonna have anything to do.  Song:  I can remember a place I used to go Chrysanthemums of white, they seemed so beautiful I can remember, I searched for the amaranth I'd shut my eyes... to see  Oh, how I smiled then, so near the cherished ones I knew they would appear... saw not a single one Oh, how I smiled then, waiting so patiently I'd make a wish... and bleed  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away  I can remember... dreamt them so vividly Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me I can remember when I first realized Dreams were the only place to see them  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away Hope was wasting away Faith was wasting away I was wasting away  I never, never wanted this I always wanted to believe I never, never wanted this How could I have become? I never, never wanted this But from the start I'd been deceived I never, never wanted this How could I have become?  I never, never wanted this I always wanted to believe I never, never wanted this I never, never wanted this But from the start I'd been deceived I never, never wanted this  Inside a crumbling effigy But you promised So dies all innocence But you promised me  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away Hope was wasting away Faith was wasting away I was wasting away  "The Great Disappointment"-AFI

      Well today wasn't to bad I guess. School wasn't overly bad suprise suprise. My little chats w/ Molly in study hall are always interesting. I think I did really good on a chemistry test. 6th period study hall wasn't the greatest today right Danielle? "My life is on the floor." How sad. 8th period was awesome. I had a lesson but instead I just hung out in the chorus room with Heidi, Aaron, and Linz. Aaron and I listened to The Early November and talked about music. That was cool. I found out that I can bring my TEN cd in to Best Buy and get a new one because mine skips. I think I might do that sometime. I was singing on the bus the whole way home but I was bored. So now I'm listening to The Early November and typing on here and downloading Rooney. Later I have jazz band from 6-10ish. Tomorrow I think I'm staying after school to help set up for Cabaret.  Song:  Way to try, I got a line For you from me, better nice A beautiful, baby blue Sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  But it's okay We'll come around With nights like this are never ending I try so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I know you want it all And you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay, for just in case that day  -Baby Blue- The Early November

      Well, here I am, online and bored again. I talked to Gavin earlier. He's got a job at the Prospect Resturant (about 15 seconds from my house) and he's excited for the talent show so I'm happy for him. I think I'm gonna go to the talent show (??). That should be cool. Well I just can't wait for this week to be over. It is crazie. Eh, whatever, everything works out in the end right? I hope so.   Well right now I'm listening to "Like the Angel" by Rise Against and wishing that I could play bass and be in a bad. That would freakin awesome. I'm also downloading some Rooney songs right now and looking up information on Japanese immigration for English. Rooney is a good band. I love music. It takes me away from all my problems. It takes me to a place where I'm happy and normal and I don't have to think about my problems. Music Saves Me.  Song- Like The Angel- Rise Against

      Jazz band last night was almost fun. Today was just another school day. Kinda crappy but then again kinda not. I dunno... Someone ate some of my cookies for spanish. I had to swim for gym today. Water polo was fun. I scored a point! I had a double lunch today cause Ischia wasn't there. I threw a cookie down Kim's shirt on accident. 6th per study hall was fun as always. We had a pen war. Kim was the loser. lol The rest of the day was boring. Atleast I don't have jazz band tonight. It's kinda a bad thing though cause now I won't have anything to do and I'll just set myself up to get hurt again like I always do. Why do I do that to myself? I'm so stupid. I was happy earlier today but then I got bored and I kept thinking all the "what ifs" and it upsets me and makes me feel like shit.  I hate thinking. Everything would be better if I could just clear my head and escape from this messed up world. Sometimes I hate myself so bad for acting like this. I'm a loser and I know it. I have no life. I sit at the computer and wait to talk to the only person I actually want to talk to ever and the more I sit here the more upset and weird I get. What is my problem? I think I need to see a therapist or something because I just get more and more messed up every day. Sitting here I feel so empty inside. And please don't tell me I'm messed up or phsyco of that I have problems because that doesn't make anything better for me. Pretending to be happy every day is hard enough. I'm getting good at it though. Sometimes I almost fool myself into thinking that I'm happy.   Happy 18th Birthday to Gavin!  Song- Twenty Three- Yellowcard

      Well school today was boring. What else is new tho... Well Carol has a date for prom now I guess. I'm happy for her. Don't get me wrong. But it kinda makes me upset because I'm now the only person in the limo who doesn't have a date. It doesn't look like I'm gonna find a date either. How much of a loser am I? Anyone have any ideas who I should go with?  Jazz band sucked last night. And I have to do it all over again today too. The soloists on all of the singing songs blow big time (except for sarah shes the best!). And I don't even like over half of the songs we are playing. Two hours of non-stop playing the saxophone is seriously murder on my back and my mouth. My freakin neck is killing me today. I can barely move it. I feel bad for Kristen. She has it worse. Hope your back feels better Kristen!!!  This week is the week from hell! Here is my schedule: Today: jazz band from 7-9 Tomorrow: lots of projects and studying for 30 week tests and can't forget swimming in gym Thursday: homework as soon as I get home from school then jazz band from 6-9:30 (probally later) Friday: Cabaret Saturday: filming AP project w/ carol, kayla, and allison from 2-4? then cabaret Sunday: Palm Sunday: church then the annual trip to Chester's florist w/ my mom, emily, and paige (crazy huh?)  Well I guess I'm gonna go now. Gotta look up info on some president's wife for AP and japanese immigrants for English. Hmm it would help if I had a working printer wouldn't it? Wow this sucks.

Didn't have to swim for gym today. 6th per study hall Carol made a poem and it goes like this: Carols hot Neds not Kelly sucks I like ducks Danielle blows Kaylas toes Kevins a commi Matt likes ya mommi Well after school I made cookies for Spanish. Then Carol helped me w/ my Math 30 week (thanks carol). Now I only have 2 problems left. That brings me to now. Now I'm typing in this and talking to Josh (love kitten). Tonight I have jazz band from 7-9. fun funness right? yea not really.  song- The Reason- Hoobastank

      Well for the past couple of hours I've been working on my math 30 week...I could use some help on that. If anyone was good at Math B could you help me please? And then it was on to my US History. But then I realized I didn't bring the book home. Oh DARN. lol. So that's why I'm online now. To look up the stuff for history. Fun funness huh? Yea not really. Well I probally won't be on tomorrow cause it's gonna be a busy day. Here is what's happening tomorrow: 1. School 2. Homework as soon as I get home from school (maybe online??) 3. Jazz Band from 7-8:30 4. Get home around 9 and watch 1 hour of TV while doing more homework before I finally go to bed. And then I get to do that all again Tuesday cause the cabaret is friday and saturday (come watch us suck everyone!!!)  Well I'm off. G'nite to everyone. Lots 'o lovin', Kelly

      Well I talked to Carol and we decided that it makes no sense to have the limo for prom pick us up at Kayla's house. It is a waste of time and money. Does anyone else agree? I hope so because we are basically wasting an hour and a half and I don't wanna do that. Would you rather have 3 hours for the limo after prom or 1 hour and 15 mins? I think 3 hours is more of what I'm thinking. It just doesn't seem right. Well, now I'm bored and I'm talking to Gavin and listening to The Reason by Hoobastank still...its a really good song. Well if anyone knows what we should do about the limo situation thing talk to me about it cause I dont know what to do.  Why do I constantly cry lately? What the hell is wrong with me? One thing I do know is that once all this shit clears up I will be such a better person. I know I've changed so much and I liked the old me but I think I will like the new me better. I hope other people will too. I can't help that I changed. It was against my will but if that means you can't like me anymore than ok. But I hope it means you will like me more.    I'm not a perfect person  There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you  It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears -"The Reason"-Hoobastank  awesome song

      Well, It's not like I'm happy or anything. I'm not gonna just smile and pretend that I am either. My life has been falling apart all around me lately. First of all, my boyfriend of almost a year and a half and I broke up about 2 weeks ago. Second, I am having major family problems (some of you know what I'm talking about). Oh, and I can't forget the fact that my grandma is dieing. I have no date for prom. I have tons of major tests comming up. I am currently failing math with a 61 (??). I try to talk to people and noone understands me anymore. Well, enough of that sad depressing stuff.  On to some happy stuff I guess. Well Carol and I went shopping yesterday and I got a pretty bracelet for prom and a pink skirt (yea u heard me right, kelly in a skirt...well ive changed a lot over the past month and the new kelly wears skirts sometimes) weird huh?. Then we came back to my house and watched Gothika and Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star. Friday night I went with Carol to see Jersey Girl. Yea, I know, it seems like my only friend is Carol doesn't it? Well, sometimes she is the only person that will be there through all this shit I'm going through. And she atleast doesn't say "oh yea i understand what ur going through" like all the other people. Because she knows that she doesn't understand. Noone really truely does. And it kills me to not be able to talk to anyone. I think my mom is the only person I can talk to right now who knows how I'm really feeling. She is so good to me. She talks to me every night as I cry myself to sleep and I love her for that because otherwise I don't know anyone I could talk to. And I don't think I would be able to sleep at night either. As it is, I haven't slept in my own room for about 3 weeks because I've developed a fear of being alone. Yea, that's right, I'm afraid of being alone. Not just like alone in a room, or alone in my own house, but alone as in 'I won't ever love anyone again and will die alone' kind of alone. Someone please help me. I need serious serious help.  Yea, I know, it sounds like I'm all depressed and sucidal and stuff, but I'm not. It's just that it's hard to be happy right now with all this stuff happening. But don't worry about me, I'll get through it, and I'll be the happy Kelly that everyone knows again....someday.  Song: Hoobastank- The Reason ---awesome song...very meaninful to me right now

      The longer I sit here with nothing to do, the more I think.  I hate thinking. I hate it because there's only one thing I ever think about. And that one thing is the thing I can't have. Well since I can't express how I feel in words, I'll do it by song lyrics. Here we go:   And now I think that you should know That you've got everything That I've wanted for so damn long And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything If you tell me that I'm not wrong So know I think that you should know That I've been waiting for you   -Waiting For You-Allister    It's been so long I should just move on There's other fish in the sea But I keep hoping that you'll swim back to me   -The One That Got Away- Allister    I've been sitting here for hours Burned an image of you in my mind Finding comfort in the words you say But it's not the same I know you're worth the wait And I can't explain What I'm going through inside But I would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight   -Scratch-Allister    It wasn't supposed to be like this Another dose of unhappiness   -Emily-Bowling For Soup    How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done? I don't know if I should stay or turn around and run I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away   -Breathing-Yellowcard    Waking up from this nightmare How's your life, what's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is   -Empty Apartment-Yellowcard    Made my mistakes, let you down And I can't, I can't hold on for too long Ran my whole life in the ground And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone And something's breaking up (breaking up) I feel like giving up (like giving up) I won't walk out until you know Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do You are my only my only one   -Only One-Yellowcard    I am destroyed by the inside, I disassociate I hope to destroy the outside, it will alleviate and elevate me Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days Like morphine cuts through, through deadened veins, I'm numbing in these days   -Bleed Black-A.F.I.    Make a move on me baby I cant be the one who's always taking chances see me down so you get down no you've got me all wrong i just want to kiss your lips and you kiss back   -Stay Away-Rooney   Well, hopefully now you can get an idea of how I might feel. No I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just want you to understand me.

      Thursday- The last day of school before vacation. It sucked. I was in such a bad mood yesterday and I don't know why. Well I think I kinda know why....but I don't want to talk about it and I'm sure everyone knows anyways. So then after school, I went to Kim's softball game with Carol and Sarah. That was kinda fun making fun of the other team's coach. They lost 6-5 tho. Congrats to Kim for moving up to Varsity! I'm so proud of her. lol Then I came home and just watched tv and was depressed all night. I was in an even worse mood then.   I woke up this morning at 9:30 but told myself I was stupid and to go back to sleep. So I watched tv and was kinda half asleep. After I got bored of that I got online. And now I'm listening to Rooney and talking to Molly. Maybe I'll go to teen thing tonite...I dunno...  So whatever. This vacation is gonna suck. I hope someone has a good party so I can go and actually have fun for once...  Song:   I've forgotten what it feels like to feel normal  To be normal And I've forgotten what food tastes like The way it tastes right The taste buds taste right Well I wake up in so much spit and sweat It is not normal  What is normal I go to bed When I wake up After cleaning all All the spit and sweat Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' I'm Sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now  I tossed and turned all night Cause I, cause I was looking for, for an ending This was so because, because I watched all day The "Neverending story" with Atreyu The next day came but not a beam of light Because the blinds were shut sh sh sh shut so tight I fell out of bed laced in spit and sweat It made me very cold Now I'm now I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' I'm sh sh shakin' sh shakin' now   I'm supposed to feel better This nightmare supposed to end   I am holding on  I'm shakin' now  -"I'm Shakin'"-Rooney

      I don't know what to do. I'm confused out of my mind. I want to go to the talent show tonight to see Gavin but then again I don't want to get hurt again. I miss the hell outa that boy. But shhh don't tell him that because I don't want him to know how much control he still has over me.   I hate the feeling I feel when I think of how we aren't together anymore. It's like this empty, chill, choked-up, lump in the throat, gives you goose-bumps kinda feeling. Oh no, here I go again. More crying. I just can't help it. I love him so much and he doesn't feel the same way about me. It's completely impossible to get over him. I love him more and more every single day. The longer we are apart the more I know for sure that I truely love him.   People might say that I don't truely know what love is but they are wrong. I do. As I told Molly today:  Love is when a gun is held to a person's head and you would take the bullet for them.   Love is when you are without the person, you can't eat or sleep.   Love is when a smile comes to your face whenever you think of this person.    Love is when everything people say can be related to that certain person.   All of what I just said pertains to Gavin. Love is what I felt, still feel, and always will feel for Gavin. I can't help the way I feel, and I can't change the way he feels. I accept that. I just wish he felt the same as me. And I know that all I can do is wish. And that's what I will do, forever if I have to.   Noone can change how I feel so please, don't even try.    You think it's not hard to smile and laugh and put on a happy act for people every day? Well it is. Try it every day for a month and you will know how I feel. I feel like I'm dying inside and yet I smile and laugh for all my friends so they don't realize how much hurt and pain I'm in right now.  Song:  The colors have built up in my mind They're bleeding through my heart But nobody knows that they exist Look at my bursting veins Now do you see the red in me It's a sigh for the end Only the end of the red Will show you my blueside  I've been given my brush and plate Where will I paint my life And will the buyer in the sky Believe in what I dream It's so hard for me to explain What I will miss to myself Only the end of the red Will show you my blueside  -"Blueside"-Rooney  And with that, I'll go cause I'm sure you don't want to hear what I say anyways. I seriously doubt people read this anyways.

      Haven't posted in a while so here's whats happened.:  Monday-School. Then I went to Kayla's to do the AP project after school. That was really fun. I was there until 9:00. Then I went home and worked on my English project until 11.  Tuesday- Didn't go to school un 10. Found out I got a 95 on my math 30 week (thanks carol). Then after school I came home and Carol got off the bus at my house and we just hung out until 9. Then I watched One Tree Hill.   Today- School was okish. I got a 79 in math (yay). I thought I was gonna fail. And I got a 92 in chem and an 83 in english. Danielle and I went to the "get together" in della posta's room and we hung out w/ kim, ned, kevin, bean, and matt. "Why don't you pull ur pants down kim?"-Kevin. It was some fun times. Then I came home and got online. Now I'm talking to Dan and listening to The Early November.  Song:  I got a day and a reason Why I should not believe in Anything, anymore What's this for  My time well spent   I've got all these memories That I cannot believe in 'Cause I don't know Where I've been All these years  All these years  And do you know this reason I hope that you can see it 'Cause I will not give up and We all know what you've done again I can see right through you You're making your way over again Again  Two days after leaving  And I don't have a reason To keep you from being here But I don't steer These thoughts away  I know that you know this But I could never get you To believe all my fears Is this your clear?  I think so  Again, again Again  -"Dinner At The Money Table"-The Early November

I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing   I dare you to forget   those marks you left  across my neck from those nights when we were both  found at our best I could make this obvious,  and you, you could deny me all in one breath you could shrug me off  your shoulders...   I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing   Just forget me it's that simple Just forget me it's that simple   -"  Your Own Disaster  "-Taking Back Sunday

      Cabaret last night was fun. I guess. I got to wear a hat for the last song! It was better than Friday night but there weren't as many people there. My dad was supposed to go. But he didn't.  Big suprise there.  Just another disappointment from him. He never goes to anything that I do. Shows how much he really cares.   Today so far just sucks. I woke up and just wanted to fall back asleep but I couldn't. Then I went to Chester's florist like we do every palm sunday and bought flowers. Then went to friendly's and ate lunch. This is where I realized how much I miss my old life. I miss everything about it. I miss being happy, I miss not being single, I miss being able to talk to my friends, I miss not having to worry about anything.  But most of all,   as much as I don't want to ,  I miss him.  Sometimes I hate myself for what I've turned into. I hate how I view the world now. I wish I could be the happy Kelly I once knew. Well, after I realized this I've been completely lost for the rest of the day. It's like I don't even know myself anymore. I've found myself just sitting there and I don't remember what I was even thinking about. I don't know what to do with my life. It's like I'm a shell of a person with nothing inside.  I'm empty.   Well, right now I'm listening to the 2003 warped tour cd and thinking about working on my english project and wondering about what I should do with my meaningless life.  Song:  They will mislead you, plug in and bleed you I swear I heard the DJ say "Swallow temptation", believe the answer Is in the order you obey   I know my purpose isn't on a poster sign  I'm still part of the game that any number can play  Majority vote, identity? No! Top forty reasons to spoon feed Immunity lost, full price at your cost Industry living by disease  Imagine, idolize and idealize A dream a nighmare couldn't change Any number can play   The sound remains unclear, There's little left to hear except contradiction Looks like somebody made our mind When history repeats the hit that I've heard for my whole life   Bring back request to radio, Your favorite song was written but you'll never know A selection for us to see a blind conspiracy Another version of the imitated tune and not one soul was saved Any number can play  -"Any Number Can Play"-No Use For A Name  Ever notice how all the songs I'm listening to pertain to what I just said? Wow what a coincidence. (Weird thing is it actually is a coincidence.)

      In a little while I'm going over to Carol's and probally spending the night there. I guess she has everything set for her for prom now. Now all I need is a date and everything will be good. I have an idea of who I might ask but it's a secret. Everyone will find out soon though.   Tomorrow I might have to go to my dad's house. If not I'll probally be here being bored.  No Song Right Now Because I'm On My Mom's Part Of The Computer.  G'nite Everyone!

      I finally got a good night's sleep! First in about 2 months. I had to take stuff to put me to sleep though so that sucked. I hate medicine. I'm against taking it for some weird reason. So I woke up to the phone ringing at 11:30 and it was Carol. I guess she's comming over later. Which is good because I'm gonna be bored all day anyways.  Anyone want to do anything tonight?  Right now, I'm talking to Carol and Jon and listening to Less Than Jake.  Song: So you say, all your white flags are up and that you've had enough and that you were tired of collecting dust, you say everything always looks the same and you made your brand new face to match your brand new place, you say all your distress calls have gone out and your ship is going down  [Pre-chorus] Well I say it to myself all the time,  "Stop living half and a life and stop feeling like I'm half alive."   [Chorus] I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied, I've wasted my time with this daily grind, in single file line, is this real life, I've been telling myself sometimes,  what matters is on the inside.   Do you remember when we had all the answers, and can you really remember when we wished for anything better, just to feel like it's been forever, does it feel like a broken record, a head full of yesterdays, you keep wishing your life away, you keep looking over you own shoulder,  things'll never look up unless you start to move forward.   [Pre-chorus]  [Chorus]  [Chorus 2] I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied, I've wasted my time with this daily grind, I can't get enough, I'm just getting by, I can't stand this design for our bitter lives, I keep feeling lost and I'm not satisfied with traffic and turnpikes and these tired eyes  [Chorus] -Motown Never Sounded So Good- Less Than Jake

      Well I restarted so now I'm listening to Mest (cd courtesy of Dan B.(thanks)).   Song:   There's a time and place, for everything.   There's a reason why, certain people meet. There's a destination, for everyone. What's the explanation, when we're done?  All the summer nights spent wondering; So many questions asked, but no one's answering. Would it be okay if I left today? Took my chances on what you said was wrong?  I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret. These years spent, so faded and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.   I'll never regret these years.      Now here i sit, so far away. Remembering all our memories. Its times like these that I miss you most, Remembering when we were so close.    I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, we'll never regret. These years spent, so faded and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years.  We'll never forget the places we've been, you and i. Our lives are slipping away. Don't want to let time pass us by, byyyyyyy...  I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret.  These years.... ...spent, so faded and wreckless,  Not sorry, and I'll never regret... I'm jaded, stupid, and wreckless. Not sorry, and I'll never regret these years. -Jaded (These Years)- Mest featuring Benji Madden of Good Charlotte

      Sorry I just felt like doing that. lol  Well, after mass confusion and muchos thinking, I have come to the conclusion that I am bored. And for some reason I'm in an almost good mood today too! Wow weird right?  Carol left my house at around 1 and after that I just sat around all day and watched tv. Pathetic, I know, but this is my life and I've come to accept that.  Since I am in desperate need of money right now, tomorrow I am probally going to go rake leaves for my grandma. Fun right? Whatever, she said she would pay me $5/hour which is better than nothing.  So, right now I am talking to Carol because she's my bestest friend ever and she's awesome. lol My speakers aren't working right now so I can't listen to any music so yet again there is no song for now. Maybe later.

      Please don't hate me. Because I hate myself enough for everyone.  Well, I woke up early this morning and I was laying in bed and I was thinking. Bet you can't guess what I was thinking about. Yea, that's right, you guessed it, it's Gavin. I really hope he doesn't read this thing. Well, anyways, I was thinking about how much I miss him and how I would give anything to have him back and I realized I don't miss the person he is now, I miss the person he was when we first started going out. I still love the hell outa him but I don't miss the person he has become. Well, that's it for now. More later maybe.  NO Song

Stinky scares me. i feel sad. i am in a very fickle predicament. what to do hot german guy or stinky? what should i do please all comments should be sent to kelly so she can relay only the good answer ending in you should go with hottie German to me. If you say i should go with stinky i will come over to your house and hit you over the head with a tackhammer repeatedly. So your best bet would be not to reply at all to my request.

      Sometimes I hate you so bad.  You're face makes me want to puke.  I shake with anger whenever I think of you.  And yet, I don't hate you.  I want to so bad though.  I wish I could hate you for what you did to me.    But I can't.    I've forgiven you for all the crap you are putting me through.  I forgive you for the future crap I will go through all because of you. And I hate myself for still thinking that we could be together someday. And I hate myself for still puting up with your shit. And I hate myself for still wanting to be with you. And I hate myself for still thinking about you every moment.   And most of all,   I hate myself for still being totally and completely head-over-heals in love with you.   Whatever. Those are just my thoughts on a certain person. You know who you are.  And now...my grades for this marking period: English-83 AP US History-84 Chemistry-92 Math-79 Spanish 4-96 Stage Band-93 Symphonic Band-99 Wind Ensemble-97 Phys Ed-99 Overall-89.80  Not Bad Eh?

      BORED!!!! And sick. And it sucks really bad. I hate this. Why do I have to be like this? I hate my boring life. Nothing exciting ever happens to me. The only things that ever happen are bad things. My life sucks.  Well right now I'm listening to Allister and talking to Carol and Gavin. Later I have a doctor's appt so I might not be on again today.   Song:  If I could tell you one thing Then I'd tell you everything I'd probably say that you've been on my mind Since we held hands out in the rain Smoking cigarettes to play Off all the butterflies I had inside  And now I think that you should know That you've got everything That I've wanted for so damn long And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything If you tell me that I'm not wrong So know I think that you should know That I've been waiting for you  Since we sat underneath the stars as I held you in my arms Killing just another summer night  It's funny how the best things happen sometimes And how I'll always remember those endless nights But don't forget I regret the fact that I have to leave you Right as the best part starts So I thought I'd take the time to say  -Waiting For You- Allister

      The longer I sit here, the sicker I feel. So don't be suprised if I'm not on at all for the rest of the night.  Or tomorrow for that fact.  I've been trying to cut back on my online time lately. (If you can't tell.) Because I seem to get extremely upset when I'm online.  Whatever.   I'm better than how I force myself to feel .  If only I could always remember that...  Song:  I've come to my senses, That I've become senseless, I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships, Every last conviction, I smoked them all away, I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way, So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?" Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems,  [Chorus:] I'll sing along, Yeah with every emergency, Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophies, I'm so far gone, That deep down inside I think it's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy  I could be an expert on co-dependency, I could write the best book on underage tragedy, I've been spending my time at the local liquor store, I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor, So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?" I'm so over-dosed on apathy and burnt out on sympathy.  [Chorus]  Let the meaning slip away Lost my faith in another day, Self deprication seems okay, I never thought I'd make it anyway  [Chorus]  I'm my own worst enemy [x5]  -The Science Of Selling Yourself Short- Less Than Jake

      Well I'm doing nothing today. AT ALL. I'm wicked bored. There's nothing on tv and the only person online is Carol and she's away! GRR. I hate it when this happens. And to top things off I think I'm getting sick. Why do I always have to be sick on vacations?  Well right now I'm just sitting here being bored and listening to Allister. They are a good band. Everyone should check them out.  Song:  Well you think you know it all You think that you deserve the best, but I've got news for you Your bullshit smile can't pass this test Cause there's somethin that I've wanted to say I've wanted to say to you, woah I've been waiting to say to you, woah for so long  This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new  Now I get sick of listening to your whining Cause you may have found success, but your still living life out lie Now I can't wait fot the day that you will burn out and fade away, woah You'll burn out and fade away from the world (woah)  This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new This time I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new   Why can't I understand your superficial views (woah), but I can understand I can't take much more of you?   Fuck you, I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new Fuck you, I'm ready I'm ready for somethin new  -"Know It All"- Allister

      Lol Carol. Inside joke. Ask if you wanna know.   Friday - I was bored and Carol came over then we went to Teen Thing. It was kinda funnish I guess. I wish more people had been there. Carol spent the night Friday.   Saturday - My mom, Emily, Carol, and I went to Carousel mall. I bought flip flops for prom and a really cool yellow shirt that looks really good on me. That made me happy. I like spending money. We saw Adam at Kahunaville. He's a funny kid. I think Emily should date him.    Sunday - Easter. Went to my grandma's house and spent it w/ the fam. It wasn't terribly bad I guess. Aubree was there and she is really cute. Then I got home and was watching tv when Carol called. She met two guys. Aaron and Raik. Raik is for Germany. I'm trying to get her to ask Raik to prom. And if Carol takes Raik I will take Aaron (perfect right?). The only bad thing is they live in Saranac Lake (3 hours away). Whatever if we can get them up on weekends I'm gonna try to get Carol to convince Raik that we should go on a double date. (yay fun!)   Today - Fun. I went to my mom's office in Oneida with Carol and Emily. We sorted through clothes (clotheses) and just hung out. Carol really likes this Raik guy. Then we went to Pepi's Pizza and ate (wow suprise) pizza and played shooting games in the arcade. Then I came home and now I'm online listening to Allister and talking to Carol.  Song:  I've been sitting here for hours Burned an image of you in my mind Finding comfort in the words you say But it's not the same I know you're worth the wait And I can't explain What I'm going through inside But I would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight  We can take our time Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  I've been sitting here forever Your voice is resonating in my mind Countless hours with you on the phone And now I'm not alone I know you're worth the wait  But I can't escape  What I'm going through inside But i would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight  We can take our time Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  I know there's no time left for second chances Still we're right despite these circumstances You've changed me more than you could ever know So we will just hang on until tomorrow So take my hand, don't ever let me go This time it's right   We can take our time  Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  -Scratch- Allister

      ...at driving that is. My mom made me drive today and I realized I'm really good actually. Except when it comes to turning. I just can't turn. I think I have a "left-turn-disfunction" lol. Well, I went and picked up my dress at Mimi's and then went to pick up groceries with my mom. It was boring. I love my dress though. It's the hottest.  Tonight I'm going to Battle of the Bands at Mt. Markham with Kim and Sarah. That's basically going to be the highlight of my whole weekend because my life, overall, sucks.  Song: Call me out You stayed inside One you love Is where you hide Shot me down as I flew by Crash and burn I think sometimes you forget where the heart is  Answer no to these questions Let her go, learn a lesson It's not me, you're not listening now Can't you see something's missing? You forget where the heart is  Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay    Waking up from this nightmare How's your life, what's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is    Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay   It's okay to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around  You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone  And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again  And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend   Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay It's okay It's okay -Empty Apartment- Yellowcard

      Yesterday I went to Kim's softball game and they won 6-5 and Kim did awesome again! Then I went shoe shopping with Carol.   Today wasn't to terrible I guess. Aside from the fact that I am so tired. I got a 92 on a math quiz! YAY! And I had fun study hall today so that was good. I'm not going to teen thing tonight because I just want to hang out at home and be alone for a while.  Tomorrow I am going to Kim's softball game in VVS and then going to Battle of the Bands at Mt. Markham! It's gonna be friggen awesome. I can't wait! My mom is actually letting me go because I'm going w/ Kim and Sarah! I'm so excited about it. It's probally going to be the best ever. I hope.  Right now I'm just sitting here listening to Rooney and being bored.  Song: I'm losing you, I'm losing all control Jus' let me be, let me be alone tonite Wanna be alone tonite Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again, and try your love for all again  It's time to work, to work is useless now Oh, can't you see, your health is lost to me Wanna be alone tonite Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again and try your love for all again  We've lost all hope for coming back We've lost all hope for coming back We've lost all hope(we've lost all hope)for coming back Lost all hope for coming back  Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again and try your love for all again -Losing All Control- Rooney

       Today sucked.  I am so over tired. School was stupid today. People just seem to piss me off sometimes for unknown reasons. The only fun part was playing pens in sh w/ danielle, kate, mike, mike, adam, and billy. The rest was just stupid and pointless. So overall, today was an uneventful, boring, completely pointless day. I hate days like this. Also, I asked Sarah about the Battle of the Bands and she said I could go with her and Kim. It's Saturday at 7 at Mt Markham I think. Sarah's boyfriend, Alan's band is playing in it and also, I think Dan's band (Imperfect Picture) is playing in it. That's all I know about it so far. So I guess I'm going to that.  It's gotten so hard to get up in the morning. I just want to fall asleep and dream because dreams are way better than reality right now. I look at pictures of when I was the happiest person alive and think, "What happened to me?, What made me like this?, Why can't I be the happy person I used to be?". And I search, constantly, for the answers to these questions, and I find none.  Right now I'm listening to Allister and kinda talking to Gavin. Later I might be going to Kim's softball game. (?) I don't know what else.  Song: Hiding in back and never make a sound If you don't speak your thoughts They can't be turned around You lead a targeted youth Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet  Finding short term courage in a flask Another wasted day you're never getting back You lead a targeted youth Would only talk to certain few Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet Torn apart and...  Camouflaged in the background and holding things deep Never showing your true self to the kids you meet Finding shade in imagination One more day forgotten to the world  Hiding in back and never make a sound If you don't speak your thoughts They can't be turned around You lead a targeted youth Would only talk to certain few Can't find the courage to leave your shell yet Torn apart and...  Camouflaged in the background and holding things deep Never showing your true self to the kids you meet Finding shade in imagination One more day forgotten to the world    (One more day forgotten to the world)    Finding short term courage in a flask Another wasted day you're never getting back -Camouflage- Allister

      So yesterday- I went to school. I wasn't too bad. And then I went to Kim's first varsity softball game with Carol and Sarah. Kim did friggen awesome. I'm so proud of her! She had an awesome bunt, and couple really good catches, she scored a run, and she batted 2 for 3! And they won 4-3! yay! That makes me happy for them. Then I went back to Carol's and played around-the-world with Carol, Kim, and Sarah. It was muchos fun. Then I came home and watched Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill (  Today- School was actually funnish. Weird huh? Well, I had fun study hall today, and basketball in gym, and a almost-not-bad-math class, and Dan got to teach me, Heidi, and Hilary a buncha stuff in chem cause the teacher wasn't there (I actually know stuff now!). And I am Ann Putnam for our play in English class. I have one of the main parts! yay! It's fun acting infront of the class because I get to forget about my problems for 40 mins and pretend to be someone else. So now I've just been watching tv and waiting for my mom to get home with food so I can eat dinner. Later, I'm doing nothing.   I gotta remember my prom ticket money tomorrow and I gotta remember to ask Sarah about going to battle of the bands with her. It would be cool to go and some of the hott-guy-in-a-band type of guy. lol  Song:  Something missing  Left behind Search in circles Every time I try I've been here before I've seen you before I can't escape walking down these halls  Hard to find a place where there are no walls   And no lines begging me to cross  Only straight ahead better move along Like Clockwork I commit the crime  I pretend to be everything they like  I've been here before I've seen you before And I trade everything for this And I trade everything for this Why do I read the writing on the wall Why do I read the writing on the wall I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time -These Walls- Trapt

      So I was at Carol's being really bored and waiting for Raik to get on. Which he still hasn't. Carol is going to kill him if he doesn't. And I rock and Midget-Around-The-World-In-One-Day!! So now, I'm here, thinking about my meaningless life. Do I Mean Anything To Anyone? I wish I could think of something, just one thing, meaningful to say right now but I'm drawing a blank.  Well, back to school tomorrow and I'm actually happy. Aside from the classes, school is fun. I mean, I get to hang out with all my friends so I'm not bored and thinking on overdrive.  Why do I write in here? Does anyone even read this? Oh, well, doesn't matter.  This will be my last post for today I think so g'niters to everyone.  Song:  I wish there was a photograph that showed me here with you And I could kiss the photograph and make my wish come true   I wish I was a humming dove so I could sing so sweet   I wish that I could steal the moon and kiss it with my feet   I wish I was a remedy that you wanted to take A product of a recipe that no one had to bake   I wish I could forget the day the hurting in my heart And wash our mouths with listerine to make a brand new start   Watching the rain fall down Watching the rain Watching the rain Watching the rain fall down Watching the rain Watching the rain fall down   I wish there was a fairytale that turned into my life So I could kiss Prince Charming man and be his princess wife   I wish the voices in my head would leave my ears alone   So my eyes could stop their water bleeding and I could find a home   I wish there was a ruby rose where I spread my wings and flew So I could inhale the perfume and be the morning dew   I wish the raindrops on the glass would let me join their dance I'd spin and twirl and laugh with them and drown my thoughts per-chance  -Watching The Rain- Katy Rose

And she is waiting for Raik to get on so she can give him the details for prom. So yea, I'll be around. Anyone want to do anything today? Just gimme a call if u do. You know the number, if ya don't then it's in the phone book. Maybe I'll be at Carol's though. I dunno. There's nothing to do here. I miss my life when I was never bored and always had something to do. (Sigh).

      Last night I went over to Carol's and hung out w/ Kim, Sarah, and Carol. Sarah has the funniest sun burn I've ever seen. Today I've been doing nothing at all. I have to start my AP homework soon though. NOT FUN!  So, right now I am listening to cd 2 oh the 2003 vans warped tour cd. Good Stuff. Also, I am looking at The Early November site and thinking that I am extremely happy that Jeff (the drummer) decided not to leave the band. YAY!  Instead of a song today I thought I would mix it up a little and post some quotes that I think are meaningful. So here we go:  "A true friend is someone who sees the pain in your eyes while everyone else believes the smile on your face"  (courtesy of danielles profile---thanks)  "Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up." -James Baldwin   "A friend is the first one to walk in when the world walks out."   "If you are going through hell, keep going." -Sir Winston Churchill   "We didn't lose the game; we just ran out of time." - Vince Lombardi   "My friend, if I could give you one thing, I would wish for you the ability to see yourself as others see you. Then you would realize what a truly special person you are."- B.A. Billingsly   "I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies."-Pietro Aretino

        I AM A LOSER!   I can't even get a date to prom. Carol is now going with Raik and I'm the only person left in our limo going alone. THE ONLY PERSON. I'm happy for Carol,  don't get me wrong . But do you understand how bad that makes me feel? I feel like noone wants me. As if I'm damaged goods. I feel like no guy will even look at me now.  What the hell is my problem?   Am I really that ugly? What am I going to do? I'm going to look like such a dork if I go alone.

      I'm bored. I can't even go outside and play b-ball because of the storm. I do like thunder though. It's cool. So I've just been watching tv. Fun huh?  Right now I'm talking to Jon and listening to cd 1 of the 2003 vans warped tour cd. Almost everyone has an away message up. Whats up with that?  Song: Life, is floating fast away. But I look, your head is turned away.   From the moment you left I knew that something wasn't right. But the feeling inside has kept me up all night.    You and me are like one heart-beat.   So slice open my veins. And let, the romance bleed away.  Back into I thought I knew, these words inside me, tell me what to do. My heart held, in the palm of your hand. (Forget my name)Now I know, the way to go, this place inside my demented mind. (Forget my name)You saw me bleeding on the bathroom floor. (Forget my name)This time in silence, this time I win. -Bloody Romance- Senses Fail

      Friday night I went to Carol's and watched Alias and spent the night there. Then yesterday I just hung out at Carol's and played bball and stuff. Then I came home and watched Cheaper By The Dozen and Mona Lisa Smile. Today Carol, Jon, and I were gonna hang out but Carol had to go to Kayla's b-day party. So now I'm here and I'm bored and wishing I had something to do.  It makes me sick thinking about how the vacation was such a waste of time. I had so many plans and didn't do any of them. Oh Well, I don't ever regret anything I do. And I don't regret anything I have done in the past. I have made stupid mistakes, I'll admit that, but I do not regret them.  This is the way my life was supposed to be and I just have to learn to accept that.   Well, anyways, right now I'm talking to Jon and listening to Allister.  Anyone want to do anything later? I'm free all day now.  Song: it's late at night and all i can think about is how i went to work and just sat around and wasted my whole day  time goes by  and soon we forget about the way we looked the dumb things that mattered as  our lives just slipped away   i mope around like there's nothing to do another day and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away  it's late at night and all i can think about is how i went to work and just sat around and wasted my whole day time goes by and soon we forget about the way we looked the dumb things that mattered as our lives just slipped away  i mope around like there's nothing to do another day and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away  and i'm looking for something new i can't understand why i'm feeling this way memories come but they just fade away -Moper- Allister

      So I just saw Gavin for the 1st time in about 2 months. He came here to pick up the cds I burnt for him. I'm happy I got to see him for those 5 seconds. It was nice to see him and hear his voice and know that he wasn't just text on the computer screen. It's a very intense feeling. I can't even describe it. His hair has gotten so much longer since I last saw him! I don't know if I like it all that much (sorry Gavin,no offence to you, ur still an awesome person, but you know that I always say what I think). My hands were shaking so bad. And of course I looked like absolute crap. But other than that, things were good. I think? It's like surreal to me now. I keep thinking, "Did I really just see him?, Or is it just a figment of my imagination?"

      Today wasn't to bad I guess. I think I did fairly well on a Math test. Something has really been clicking for me in the last 2 weeks. I just get it now. I's so happy for myself. I had a nice talk with Danielle today during study hall about stuff. And guidance came in and talked to us about college during English today.  Well, day before prom and SAT's. I'm freaking out. I'm gonna be up for like over 24 hours straight. It's gonna be friggen awesome though. I can't wait. We are going to Zebbs and then back to Mike's house after. I hope my mom lets me say out late. Tonight I'm not doing anything. Except maybe taking a practice SAT. But that's about it so if anyone wants to stop by my house and hang out you are more than welcome.  So, right now, I'm just sitting here and listening to The Early November and I'm about to go grab the guitar and play a bit. I love music. It's slowly becoming my life. And, suprisingly, I'm happy about that because I know that I can always count on music.  Song: We find our Our way through this Knowing That the actors Who play our friends They always win  CHORUS: So come in We're all inside of nothing The place where we live our lives And take all you want Because we ain't got nothing to lose We're always looking up  But the hardest To pretend Is that we never quit So the actors who play ourselves Say they never cared -Sesame, Sheshame- The Early November

      Today was boring. I got a 93 on a Chemistry test! That was cool.   It's really nice outside today. I wish Carol and Kim were home so we could play basketball.   My mom and Emily just went on a walk so now I'm home alone. Why would anyone want to go on a walk in Prospect? I would be afraid that I would be molested by the perverts at the bar or something.  I like Allister. They are a good band. I'm listening to them right now.  I have SATs on Saturday. I'm nervous. I hope there's someone there that I know.  Prom is Saturday. It should be fun. I'm going back to Mike's house after prom. That should be awesome.  I'm looking in Oneonta College. It doesn't cost much and I could come home on weekends. That would be really cool. Plus they have the 2 things I want to do with my life. Music and Phsycology. Weird combination huh?   I've got green permanent marker on my arm from study hall today thanks to Ned.  And I'd also like to add a congrats to Gavin for  finally  getting his car on the road.   Speaking of cars...I'm going to apply at Wards this summer so I can buy a car. Hopefully a cool one. Maybe I can find a used Mini Cooper. That would be friggen awesome. I love Mini Coopers!  Wow, I'm messed up. Well, that's all for now. Maybe more later (?).  Song: I'm writing this song to tell you that I'm sorry Because I know you never thought that I'd be away so long I know its unfair to ask for you to wait for me But I don't have a real job and youre ready to move on  And its hard to keep my balance when you look the other way So I'm letting go with every breath I take in  So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you  I'm writing this song to tell you that its over Your jealously took you way too far this time Another day comes, I'm better off without you So now take a deep breath and get on with our lives  And its hard to keep my balance when you look the other way So I'm letting go with every breath I take in  So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you   So what good is today If there's not gunna be a tomorrow?  It's too much for me to take I know you don't wait forever  Just remember that life without us won't be the same   So many reasons I need something more to believe in The time has come to turn and walk away Through all these changes, mistakes There was time now its too late There's nothing more that I could say to you - Better Late Than Forever - Allister

      AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! So There. That's better I think. I'm bored and listening to Allister and talking to Jon.   I just talked to Gavin a couple of minutes ago. I like talking to him. He puts me in a good mood. And most of you know that I haven't been in a very good mood lately. I just can't explain it. I feel like I'm floating after I talk to him. It's weird and I know I shouldn't feel this way, but I do and I don't know why. This just happened within the past 2 days too. I can't explain it. It's just this non-stop-smile, feel-tingly-all-over, weak-at-the-knees sorta feeling. I've never felt like that before,   ever.   And I think I like feeling this way. I think.  Well, that's what I'm thinking right now. I probally shouldn't of written it but I promised myself I would write freely in here no matter who reads it. So here ya go. An insite into my life and the real me. I hope you like it, I hope you like me.  I'm getting off for the rest of the night now. Maybe I'll write tomorrow. I never know what's going on until the morning so you never know. Well good night, sweet dreams, and all that great stuff.   Love always,   Kelly    (What's gotten into me with all this lovey-dovey stuff? Wow I need help.)

      So I just watched Haunted Mansion. It was pretty stupid. And my mom and Emily just left to go to a bowling meeting. Wouldn't it be the shit if we could have a bowling team at HP? Well I was supposed to call Shane and tell him what time the meeting was but he forgot to give me his cell number during lunch! (sorry) And now I'm home alone, blasting music, and being bored, hence the title of this post (which is also a lyric from the song "Welcome To The New South" by Less Than Jake). Wow, I just said hence. What a funny word.  Jubilee is sitting on my lap. She loves me. (Atleast someone does.) So now I'm just listening (still) to Yellowcard because they are an amazing band. If you have some time you should check them out.   Song: Broken this fragile thing now And I can't,  I can't pick up the pieces  And I've thrown my words all around But I can't,  I can't give you a reason   I feel so broken up (so broken up) And I give up (I give up)  I just want to tell you so you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do You are my only, my only one  Made my mistakes, let you down And I can't,  I can't hold on for too long  Ran my whole life in the ground And I can't,  I can't get up when you're gone   And something's breaking up (breaking up) I feel like giving up (like giving up) I won't walk out until you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go,  there's just no one who gets me like you do  You are my only my only one  Here I go so dishonestly Leave a note for you my only one And I know you can see right through me So let me go and you will find someone  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go,  there's just no one, no one like you  You are my only, my only one  My only one  My only one My only one You are my only, my only one - Only One - Yellowcard    So Blast The Music And Sing Your Heart Out, Maybe, Just Maybe, It Will Make Things Better For Those 3 Short Minutes.

      Why did I put the date? I have no freakin idea.  So last night after my long discussion with Josh and talking to Gavin, Jon, and Dan a little, I watched One Tree Hill! I heart that show! B-ball and cute guys...what more does a girl need? lol jk The only other thing I need is Dr. Pepper!  Today- School wasn't half bad. I skipped Math. Ooooh what a rebel I am. lol I am so worried about solo fest. I'm not even close to ready and it's in a week and a half! AHH!  Other than that crap, nothings going on. Just boredom. Fun huh?   Well, right now I'm just sitting here looking at sites because there's nothing on tv right now and listening to one of my favorite bands, Yellowcard.  Song:  Empty Apartment-Yellowcard  *(already in a previous post)*

      Sunday I went to David's Bridal and Carol bought shoes for prom.   Well yesterday school was ok. Jazz band was boring. That's about it.  Today was fun. We got to swing dance in gym today. My partner was Brent. It was fun. Then I went to Kim's game after school. They lost. They still did awesome though!  Now I'm just talking to my Love Kitten (Joshy) and being bored.

      ...was awesome. Alan's band did really good. I personally thought they were the 2nd best band there. But the ended up getting last place. (You guys still rock in my book!) There were some pretty bad bands there. One of them was sooo bad I just wanted to scoop my ear drums out so I couldn't hear them anymore. They were horrible! A band named Fade won. They were awesome. They are getting signed so watch out for them! I would listen to them...that's how good they are. Well I got home around 10 last night and watched some tv and then went to bed.   Now, I'm looking up directions to David's Bridal for Carol and I'm going to be going there with her in a little while.  No song for now.

      Yay! I got a 92. Just what I was trying for. I think I could have done better but I am pretty happy with it. Carol did really awesome too. I don't know what her score was though. So after I got my score I talked to Pat for a couple of minutes and then I left Remsen (I don't ever want to go back). Then I went and rented some movies and then picked up my prom pictures! They are all so prettyful!  So, right now I'm listening to HIM and that's it because I have a boring, boring life. I hate the people that wear Bam shirts and try to be just like him. This is what I have to say to them: I hate you. Get your own life. He isn't that great of a person. Stop copying everything he or anyone else does. Find who you truely are and stop trying to act "cool" by being a wannabe. Noone will ever respect you unless you are yourself. Well, I could say more but I won't.   Song: Confusion writhes around our hearts impatiently It drains the faith that lights the dark and sets us free From the chains of our war and the pain we once called love The poison of doubt enslaves our minds and we bleed We abandon the trust that kept us blind and disappear Under the crimson wings of hate where the lost are safe Until they love again The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem We pray to the serpent of delight desperately The questions are answered and we try not to weep Until we are sure we're suffering for love In the dungeon of our dreams we're so weak The promise made to be broken still haunts our sleep We won't open our eyes afraid we would die for love again  The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem The salvation we seek will be waiting us there In the heart of darkness lonely and scared With a promise of death for our love And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love I'm lost And now that we're free from the chains of our dark love I'm lost The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song Hold me until we're one and sing me you're beautiful song The heart of darkness is hope of finding you there And that hope will be our love's requiem Take me into your arms and sing me your beautiful song Hold me until we're one and sing me you're beautiful song... -Love's Requiem- HIM

      I'm a wreck. I'm so nervous. I've been practicing for 3 hours straight now. I'm probally going to suck really bad. I hope I do good. I need this good grade to prove everyone wrong. I can take over next year and I will do as good as, if not better than (right), Erica. I'm shooting for any grade above a 90. I'm hoping its a 92 but I'm not going to get my hopes up like I did last year.  Well, right now I'm just listening to The Early November to calm me down but it's not completely working. I'll be off to go practice again in about 10 minutes.  Everyone Wish Me Luck! I'm Gonna Need It!

      So I went to Wards. Yay. First icecream of the year! That makes me happy. I heart moo trail ice cream muchos.   Well, right now I'm talking to my CA (central alliance) guy Eric. lol He's so awesome. Also, I'm just getting ready to practice for solo fest and I'm listening to The Early November. If you check out one band that I listen to, it should be them. Every song is amazing and you can practically feel the heart that they put into every song. Now that is what I call music. I mean, if you even have a doubt at how amazing they are just look at the lyrics.    Here is a sample:   Looking in your eyes Praising every moment because you're my only light Reading through stares at your passion that bears me now Shedding no little tears The silence scares us more than leaving could   CHORUS:   Come back Please don't leave me now I'll be all that you need in life Because I can't live without you and I know all that you need I can give you everything When you're so far you'll forget about me    Waiting by your side Knowing every moment is closer to your flight Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever  CHORUS   But I'll wait    I could never leave those beautiful eyes    I know you're sorry   I know what you must be going through    And I feel sorry for you     But please don't leave me now [x3]  -Come Back- The Early November

      Today wasn't to horrible. I had my AP History test today. It wasn't that hard actually. I thought the essays were hardish but I'm not at liberty to discuss the test because I signed at confidentiallity statement. lol. So I ended up only going to 2 classes today. Good deal huh? And I found out that my solo fest time is at 3:15 in room WWR. And then I went to Kim's softball game with Carol and Sarah. They kicked Poland's ass like 15-0. Yay for them. And now I'm home about to eat dinner and then I'm going to Wards for ice cream and then I'm practicing for solo fest all night.  So thats what's going on. And now I'm leaving because I'm bored.

      I'm going to fail this AP History test tomorrow. Well, atleast I get out of class right? And solo fest is going to suck major on Saturday. That is if I even got a time. Well, speaking of solo fest, I've got to go practice now. I hate practicing at home because then everyone can hear me. Maybe I'll go lock myself upstairs in my room so I atleast feel alone. I feel pretty calm considering everything that's going on.  Well, I just got back from that stupid mother-daughter dinner thing at church. It was mucho boring. But atleast it was something to do.   And thanks to the people that try to cheer me up. I appreciate it a lot.  Song: And we wait above a road We're turning to go home And the silence from the side of the car Tells me everything and how we are   There's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying tonight   CHORUS: And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone And I wonder if I'm alone in your head  I know something is wrong, I just don't know what to do You say it's only me and that I'm so perfect for you  I don't want to try no more I don't want to make this right I just want you to be true to me one time   CHORUS  Twelve days gone by since I have saw you last I'll give this one more try I'll give it all my best and I'll ask   What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side Without me by your side     And I'll take a step back and I'll let you ahead And I will take a step away and see if you come back Because there's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying, there's no more trying tonight   We'll never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same Until you're done -Sunday Drive- The Early November

      Today was just another day. I have nothing else to say about it. Nothing exciting happened at all. Wow what a suprise. Nothing good ever happens to me. I don't think I smile once today. That's how bad it was. And now I have to practice for solo fest and go to some stupid mother-daughter dinner tonight and worry about my AP History test tomorrow.  All I know is that I'm worse off as every day goes by. As I look back at happier times I realize that I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm living in this body but I am not a part of it. Who am I? I don't know.   Listen to The Early November. They are an amazing band.   Song:  Tonight is a story of love Two broken hearts set by one   And all he wants is a sign Of how she's making her mind   All we ever wanted was  Love and love and happy afternoons    Watching TV from your room While you're laying in my arms    And I know it's not fair to me To see this love walk right by me every day    Will we ever meet the right way    Again, again   Tonight I will sit next to you To see if you act like we're through To make you laugh is all I want I'll hold you while tears fill our eyes   Again, again -All We Ever Needed- The Early November

      Now, I'm going to solo fest. I don't know how I feel about that. It just means more anxiety and panic attacks for me in the next couple of days. And all my time spent practicing. I do want to do well so I do have to practice and that means I have absolutely no time to do anything with any of my friends. And I now have to worry about the AP test Friday and solo fest on Saturday.  I hate the drama. Everything is all about the drama. It's stupid and I hate it. I think life would be much better if everything were easier and maybe even boring. Then I wouldn't have to freak out and cry over every little thing and cry   atleast   2 or 3 times a day not counting crying myself to sleep every night. And for those of you who are good enough friends of mine to truely know me, I don't cry that much. I try to hide my emotions from everyone so I'm not seen as vunerable.  Well, I'm going to go eat now. Mac and cheese I guess. Yummm

      Well, last night's happiness only lasted those 2 minutes.   So you want me to write about you in my journal? Well, here I go. I hate talking to you, and yet love it at the same time. I hate the way you make me feel like crap constantly. And I hate myself for running to you all the time. I hate how you have the abilitly to control my emotions. I hate the way you treat me and then expect me to still care and I hate that I do still care. I hate that I forgive you for everything you do and I hate how you know I'll forgive you and use that to your advantage. I hate how you constantly contradict yourself, you are a hypocrite. I hate how you lie to me. I feel as if I can't ever trust anything you say ever again. I hate how you blow everything out of proportion and then get mad at me for absolutely nothing. And I hate your hair and your stupid facial hair. And I hate how you lead me on and then kick my feet out from underneath me when I'm actually happy. But I don't hate you. Not the least bit. And sometimes I think I live for how you make me feel.    "So, kill me, just kill me baby, put me through the worst pain immaginable. Just make me feel alive."   (quote by me)  I hope you are happy. I seem to have managed to write a lot about you today without even mentioning your name. Atleast I've finally admited to you how you make me feel. And that makes me feel better.  So, now that I got all that shit out of my mind, on to the other crap. Well, it doesn't look like I'm going to solo fest on saturday. Mr. Ischia just gave my time slot away because apparently I'm "not ready enough". How the hell would he know? I've been working on that fucking solo since July. Bull fucking shit I'm not ready. Well, I guess it doesn't matter much now. My one goal for this year of doing good in solo fest and making All State next year is crushed. Why does everything always get taken away from me? I hate this, when I think it can't get any worse, it does. Pretty soon I'll be left with nothing.  And to make things oh so much better, I didn't get to go to the boy's track meet to watch Kevin and Ked (Ned) which would have been so much fun.   I hate it, I absolutely hate everything. I can't take this shit anymore. As I said to someone today (I think it was Dan B.),  "I'm just one giant ball of depression, don't get to close or I might suck you in with me."   Another quote, I said it to Carol last night,  "But the thing is I can't stop talking to him. I'm like a bug drawn to a bug zapper. I know I'm gonna get killed but I keep flying towards it anyways."  Nice analogy huh?  Right now I'm talking to Molly and listening to Yellowcard.  Song:  i'm just so tired wont you sing me to sleep and fly through my dreams  so i can hitch a ride with you tonight  and get away from this place   have a new name and face    i just aint the same without you in my life   late night drives, all alone in my car i can't help but start singing lines from all our favorite songs and melodies in the air    singin life just aint fair    sometimes i still just can't believe you're gone   and im sure the view from heaven beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven, maybe we'll make it through one more year  down here    feel your fire,  when its cold in my heart and things sorta start remindin' me of my last night with you i only need one more day just one more chance to say i wish that i had gone up with you too  and i'm sure the view from heaven  beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven maybe we'll make it through one more year  down here    you wont be comin' back and i didn't get to say goodbye  i really wish i got to say goodbye  and im sure the view from heaven  beats the hell out of mine here and if we all believe in heaven  maybe we'll make it through one more year  i hope that all is well in heaven cuz its all shot to hell down here i hope that i find you in heaven cuz i'm so... lost without you down here  you wont be coming back and i didn't get to say goodbye  i really wish i got to say gooooodbye  -View From Heaven- Yellowcard  Wow, what a really long post.

      This has been the best night of just staying home I've had in over 2 months. I'm so happy right now and it feels like nothing is wrong in my life and maybe I can start being that happy person I used to be again. I have hope for myself again and I don't want to constantly cry anymore. Thank you to those people that helped me out of this for atleast the rest of the night. You know who you are. I just don't know what to say but thank you a million times over and over again.   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is  you   -The Reason- Hoobastank

      I would like to add that Gavin is not a bitch, but he is oh soooo sexy. (Atleast that's what he says.)  And I would also like to take back anything I said about Raik and prom. I said that when I was extremely mad and didn't mean anything I said. It is all untrue and I am extremely sorry about it.

      Today wasn't to horrible. I got to dis Donny in Spanish class during a thing that me and Beth wrote. Math actually went by almost fast. Study hall I always have good conversations with Molly. Band was fun. We had Chad as a substitute and he taught us how to say I love my monkey in German. It's Ich liebe meinen affen or something like that? And in Spanish it's juego con mi mono. I like monkeys. In 6th period study hall we were just quoting the Blue Collar Comedy Tour the whole time so that was fun. Then after school Carol came over and we just hung out and talked about everything that's been going on lately. She just left about 1/2 an hour ago.  Now I'm just talking to Gavin and listening to Allister.  Song: Walk home drowning these memories in the rain  Biting my lip to transfer this pain   You're gone and I'm still going through withdrawl Next time around  I'll build a stronger wall   You broke my guard with guiltless eyes Divide me like a virus from inside And came back just to salt the wounds Now thanks to you...  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes   You needed more attention than I gave Instead of talking you just played games  And smiled as my whole world became unstitched I wish I'd known you could be such a heartless bitch   You broke my guard with guiltless eyes Divide me like a virus from inside And came back just to salt the wounds Now thanks to you...  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes  I start runnin now I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes  I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away When I get too close I'm scared to stay I start runnin now (I start runnin, I'm runnin away from you) I start runnin away Now others pay for your mistakes -Flypaper- Allister  And I would like to add that Gavin is the "sexiest bitch ever". lol

      Why Am I So Fucking Messed Up Lately? What is my problem? I seem to be pushing all of my friends away when all I want to do is run to them and cry. It's just gotten to the point where I don't care anymore. I have done some stupid things lately that I can't talk to anyone about because they will probally make me see a therapist and put me on drugs which I don't want to happen. I want to be happy without drugs making me that way. It might be hard but I think I can do it and I will be stronger once I get through this.  I'm such a troubled person. I wish I just had someone to talk to. Maybe then I wouldn't take things out on myself and mess my mind and my body up so badly. I try so hard to smile and be happy for people and by the end of the day all I want to do is cry myself to sleep. It's seriously the hardest thing ever to smile when I'm crying inside and all I want is to scream.  What am I supposed to do? Just give up on life? Go through the days like a mindless zombie and pretend to be the happiest person ever?   I'm so sick of all this shit, I just want to to all disappear and have my happy life back where I didn't have a worry in the world.

      Seriously, this is not cool. I was going to college night and HCCC and guess who I see there. Gavin and Gregg. Ugh, I hate it. I don't want to see them all the time. So after I talked to Gavin for like 2 minutes, I went around to the good colleges there and got some stuff and then left asap because I was so shaken up about seeing Gavin there. So I just got home and now I'm listeing to Pretty, Pretty by The Early November and talking to Jon.  Song: Early in the morning, wake up to a bright blue sky Lightning comes at any time to break it down and make it ugly I know that it's just for me  'Cause no one else can feel or understand That's alright because I can handle all that you throw down   CHORUS:  And I hope you find a perfect place Where skies are beautiful all of the time And it's all that matters, pretty, pretty And I know that's all you could care about There's no reason why you can't    It's all about the icing, and nobody cares about what's inside  You could see the outside face, it looks good, it must be great And I know that's all you see What would it matter anyway 'Cause I can see right through your pretty, pretty skin today   No reason why I should try to go on anymore   My reason's all gone, no reason why you should   Try to make excuses to make me feel alright   Excuses call for stupid reasons   And I know that it's not much that I can offer right now   Just give me one little second and I will try my hardest   To make you feel like I'm someone else  -Pretty, Pretty- The Early November

      Well, Carol's not mad at me anymore! I explained everything to her. So that's better.  I found out some disturbing stuff about Gavin last night. He did say I was beautiful though :). Well I found out that he supposedly kissed my cousin. Great cousin I have huh?   (Large portion of this post deleted at the request of one of my good friends, Gavin. So sorry if it seems like something here is missing. It wasn't my place to write what I wrote and I am sorry to Gavin for it.)   I am just so worried about him and I just want to see him succeed in life and be happy no matter what he does. Did I mention how much I care about him? Because I do so much.  Well, tonight I'm going to HCCC for a college night. I'm going to go check out Oneonta, Le Moyne, Utica, Potsdam, and a couple other colleges. All I know for sure is that I want to be able to play music still and I want to take a class in phsycology and I want to be able to drive home on weekends (maybe).   So right now I'm looking up directions for HCCC and just typing on here. Today started out horrible. I thought I had lost my best friend forever and I couldn't stop thinking at all. After my talk with Carol it got better a little.  I just want to know how the hell I deal with all this drama? When will it all go away?  And I would also like to retract anything I said about the whole Raik thing yesterday. It was completely inappropriate and I was completely wrong. I hope everyone can forgive me for what I did.

      SATs was crazy long. It was so boring. I hope I did good.  Prom- Was freakin awesome! I loved it! I wish it never ended! So at 3 I got my hair done and I loved it! It looked awesome. And then I went to Kayla's and this is were the fun/bad part comes in. I met Raik. Who was Carol's date. And he was absolutely gorgeous. Well we took pictures at Kayla's house.   Then we went to the Grand March. I just watched it. And then we went to get into our  SUV LIMO  and who did I see? Gavin and Gregg. I almost started crying I freaked out so bad. Well, after I got over that, is where the real fun began.   We got to the prom and just hung out at our table talking. And then we ate. After that we did some awesome dancing and it was so much fun! And I got to hang out with all my awesome friends! And I got to make a new friend. Raik is an awesome person and I'm so happy that he went to prom with Carol. Well I danced with Alex Sike twice. It was really weird. I don't even know the kid.   Well, after the awesome prom, we got back into the limo and drove around for a while. Then we went to Denny's and I had and oreo sundae.   Then we rode around some more and went back to Mike Noeth's house. I finally changed out of my dress and into my bathing suit. I went in the 5 person hot tub with 12 other people. I guess you could say it was a bit crowded. We were all just hanging out when something I realized something really bad/good. Raik had been hitting on me all night. So there I am, sitting in the hot tub, with Raik's arm around me and Carol swimming in the pool not knowing what to do or say and feeling completely uncomfortable. And I can't say that I hated the fact that he was hitting on me but I did hate the fact that he was Carol's date and I couldn't flirt back with him. So I talked to Carol about him flirting with me and how I had no intentions of flirting back and she didn't seem to believe me. At all.   So we got out of the hot tub and I changed into regular clothes and went down into Mike's basement and played some pool. Where Raik continued to flirt with me even when Carol was right in front of me. And I could tell that Carol was getting more and more mad at  me  every second. Not mad at Raik for hitting on me. Mad at me for Raik hitting on me. Things like that are out of my control. I couldn't help it.   So I avoided Raik for the rest of the night until Carol was out of the room and then I talked to him. I told him how Carol is really mad at me because she thinks that I had been flirting with Raik all night and how he should stop flirting with me for the rest of the night and he said, "I know that Carol expected something more out of this but I just like her as a friend, but you..." and then he stopped talking and just looked at me and I could tell what he was trying to say. He didn't even have to say it, I knew.   So then at around 6 AM Carol's mom picked us up from Mike's and she brought us home. What an akward ride home that was. So I go to get out of the car and what do I say to Raik? "It was nice meeting you Raik." How geeky that was. What I really wanted to do was give him a giant hug and get his screen name so I could still talk to him and be friends with him but I couldn't. That would have hurt Carol way to much and Carol is my best friend. I can't do anything to hurt her. I really hope that Carol doesn't hate me. It's really not my fault and I feel so so bad about it.   So I finally got to sleep at around 7 AM and I got up at 2 so that makes 6 hours of sleep and being awake for 25 hours straight.  So other than that whole big thing, prom was the best night of my life. I had fun with all my friends and it was wicked awesome!  Right now I'm talking to Heidi, Josh, and Molly and being bored and wondering how bad school is going to be tomorrow.  Does anyone know what I should do about Carol probally hating me now? Does anyone think that I did something wrong? What should I say to Carol? Should I still talk to Raik? Someone please please help me!

      It's just better that way. So now after being bombarded with questions from my dad about driving, prom, school, and of course Gavin, I can actually relax and not be defensive about everything I say.  Tomorrow- I think I'm going to the mall with my mom so I can buy a white shirt for majors fest on Friday. I can't wait for that. I get to miss school and hang out w/ some of my very awesome friends and just have fun (well then there's the playing part).  Listening to: [Rise Against: Like The Angel]

      I just found out that my dad's wife (aka my step-mother) has cancer. Well, I'm not going to cry over it because I am in no way even close to her but it's still sad to hear. Ok, whatever, enough being down about that. Now back to life...

      Ohhh what a whole lot of fun. Not really. Well, last night I watched Radio and the Nets game and they won in triple overtime 127-120. Yay. And then this morning I went shopping w/ my Dad and then just came back here. And now I'm just sitting here doing nothing and being bored out of my mind and talking to Danielle and Jon. I think I'm going to scan my prom pictures into the computer while I'm here after my dad is done looking at them. Maybe if I get that done I'll attempt to put some of them in here later.

       "I could never ever in my whole life even if I searched every inch of the universe find another guy thats perfect for me!!"   I said that about a year ago (?).  It's still true.  And now, as I start feeling sorry for myself because I'm in home alone on a Friday night, I'm going to go before this gets worse and I do something stupid again. Molly knows what I'm talking about.

      Yesterday- I went to Ward's with Carol and then Josh met us there. Then we went back to Josh's but didn't go in the pool because it was raining. So we just hung out in his room for awhile. So I was at Josh's for about 2 hours and then rode my bike back home with Carol. Ohh I felt the burn lol. Then I went to Carol's and saw the kittens in the shed. Yea, some stray cat had 2 kittens in Carol's shed. They are so cute!  Today- School wasn't that bad. I barely did anything in all of my classes. And I played cards with Shane and Mike in SH. Shhh it's against the rules. Don't tell anyone lol. Well, I lost really bad but that's ok. I don't even like pitch anyways. After school I went to Carol's and we went on a short bike ride. After that Carol and I found out that one of the kittens got out of the shed so now there's only one left. Then I went to Kimmy's softball game where she kicked some major Little Falls butt. They won 8-2 (?). Kim did awesome. She stole home plate and she slid! Yay Kim! Then I went back to Carols and hung out and watched some of Bio Dome. That's one funny movie. And now I'm just home talking to Eric and listening to music.  Tomorrow I have to go to my Dad's. Oh joy. NOT.  Listening to: [Save Tonight by Eagle-Eye Cherry]  Go on and close the curtains 'cause all we need is candlelight You and me and the bottle of wine and hold you tonight Well, we know I'm going away And how I wish, I wish it weren't so so take this wine and drink with me  let's delay our misery...  Save tonight fight the break of dawn Come tomorrow Tomorrow I'll be gone There's a log on the fire and it burns like me for you Tomorrow comes with one desire.. to take me away  It ain't easy to say goodbye  darling please don't start to cry 'cause girl you know I've got to go and Lord I wish it wasn't so [chorus] Tomorrow comes to take me away I wish that I, that I could stay but girl you know I've got to go, oh and Lord I wish it wasn't so [chorus]

      It's really nice out so I think that's why I'm in such a good mood. Plus I had awesome times in SH today with all the people that I heart the mostest. Carol, Kim, Danielle, Kevin, Ned, and Kayla are in the paper ring gang. That's cause we are awesome! And AP is over so I basically get a SH in there every day too. It's the greatest. I got my sheet back from solo fest today. I got a 15 out of 15 for accuracy and a 10 out of 10 for tone!  My thoughts of the day are: Oompa loompas are scarier in Spanish. Ned and Kevin are the best newspaper picture defilers that I know! And last but not least, I love summer time.  Song I've had stuck in my head all day: [Get Out(Leave) by JoJo]  So in a little bit I'm riding my bike down to Wards with Carol and then going to swim in Josh's pool. It's going to be so much funness.

      So today was really good actually. The video that Carol, Allison, Kayla, and I made for AP won 3 "Szarek Emmys"! And two were kinda because of me (best filming and best costumes). Yea, I rock, I know it. lol I had three study halls today too so that was awesome. And not to mention that a couple of people actually noticed my hair and said it looks so much better! I love compliments. They make me feel pretty. :) And I can't forget about how nice it is outside and that puts me in a good mood when I can wear my summer clothes.  So right now I'm listening to my 90's rock cd because I heart 90's rock music a whole ton. Later I have some stupid bridal shower for my cousin Greg's fiance Amy. I don't even know her but oh well. Atleast I'm not going to be to overly bored at home all day.  And I just want to say...."To boys for every girllllll" Right Danielle?  Listening to: [Hey Jealousy by Gin Blossoms]   Tell me do you think it’d be all right If I could just crash here tonight You can see I’m in no shape for driving And anyway I’ve got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I’d ever had If I hadn’t blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take it’s place...hey jealousy And you can trust me not to think And not to sleep around  If you don’t expect too much from me You might not be let down   Cause all I really want is to be with you  Feeling like I matter too If I hadn’t blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take it’s place...hey jealousy She took my heart There’s only one thing I couldn’t start

      So I went and got my hair cut. It doesn't look much different. I don't know if I like it much. It's still boring. I need to think of something I can do that isn't to drastic. Does anyone have any suggestions? And nothing like "shave it" or "dye it green" or anything like that. Serious suggestions only. Well, it's this time of night I start feeling sorry for myself so I'm just going to leave you with some Rooney lyrics before I start getting all "life sucks" and shit.  Listening to: [Rooney]   Can you guess Why I haven't called you back Well I said I'm screening calls Even your calls Why am I such a bad guy I'm just doing other things Like you do other things I could never really love you Simply because simply because I could never really love you Simply because of the trust  You're up all night Fixing your hair But you're not satisfied With that I'm satisfied I'm doing things like I said before I'm not partying I'm partying from the non-creative I could never really love you Simply because simply because I could never really love you Simply because of the trust You've lost my love  -Simply Because- Rooney

      DON'T RUIN IT! So, I failed a chemistry test. I got a 63. It's better than a lot of people though. Study hall was really fun today. Kevin and Ned are so funny about the whole German thing. "It's like he's thinking of killing Jews or something!" To quote Kevin. I love those kids. They are so funny. Ned will now be known as USSR for the rest of his life. Ned: "You can call me the USSR...wait thats not a boat!" Me: "Ned, that's Russia." And Josh is now known as "Dad" because he was wearing boxers that said Dad on them today. I told everyone today that I have a crazy stalker. It was fun.  So, here are my thoughts for the day:  "I'm stronger than you think I am and I deserve more than you could ever give me." "I'm better than how people treat me and one day they will realize that mistake and it will be to late."   Tonight I'm getting my hair cut for the first time in over a year. It's not going to be that much shorter and I'm getting it angled. It won't be a big change but it's enough for now.  [Listening to: Less Than Jake]   So you say, all your white flags are up and that you've had enough and that you were tired of collecting dust, you say everything always looks the same and you made your brand new face to match your brand new place, you say all your distress calls have gone out and your ship is going down  [Pre-chorus]  Well I say it to myself all the time, "Stop living half and a life and stop feeling like I'm half alive."   [Chorus]  I can't get enough ,  I'm not satisfied ,  I've wasted my time with this daily grind ,  in single file line ,  is this real life ,   I've been telling myself sometimes, what matters is on the inside.    [Roger:]  Do you remember when we had all the answers ,  and can you really remember when we wished for anything better ,  just to feel like it's been forever , does it feel like a broken record, a head full of yesterdays,  you keep wishing your life away , you keep looking over you own shoulder,  things'll never look up unless you start to move forward.   [Pre-chorus]  [Chorus]  [Chorus 2] I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied, I've wasted my time with this daily grind, I can't get enough, I'm just getting by,  I can't stand this design for our bitter lives, I keep feeling lost and I'm not satisfied with traffic and turnpikes and these tired eyes   [Chorus] -Motown Never Sounded So Good- Less Than Jake

      By the way...I'm thinking of traveling for a month or two when I graduate next year. I just need to meet new people, see new faces, and most of all just get away from all of my problems here. I'm thinking Europe. Maybe Rome, Paris, London, Sicily, Dublin, Berlin, somewhere in Finland and probally one more place in Germany, and more places. Mostly I want to go to Ireland. If anyone would like to go with me, it is going to be as cheap as possible and I welcome company. Leave a comment in the comment section if you want to go. My plans aren't final but this is what I really want to do.

      It's every day. I cry myself to sleep over you. And I know I can't control how you feel about me, I truely wish I could. And I want you to be happy but I'm so unhappy without you. My life is empty. I live for the moments I talk to you and yet you always make me cry. When I don't talk to you, I worry, I worry where you are and who you're with. And I constantly just want to be with you and be happy like we used to be. Why can't things just be how they used to be? What happened to us and our plans?   My one regret in life is losing you.   I'll never give up on you. Ever. And I'll wait for you forever. Even if it means being lonely for the rest of my life. I would rather be lonely than with someone I don't truely love.  Why do you always end up making me cry? Why don't you care at all? Do you enjoy hurting me? Do you enjoy watching my heart shatter into a million pieces and laughing as I try to piece them back together?   I love you more than life itself. Life without you just isn't living. If it's not you, then it's noone.  I just want you to understand...   I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT    And I don't fucking care who reads this. Maybe once you know what is going on in my life you will actually realize why I don't smile anymore and why I don't talk anymore. And maybe, just maybe, someone out there will actually care.

      Today was...interesting. I don't really know what else to say about it. I should just stop talking to people altogether. They depress me by telling me stuff I don't want to hear. I think I failed a chem test today. It was really hard.  I've been writing down my thoughts through out the day for some reason lately. Here are some from today: "You may be able to defeat me, but you can never destroy me." That was my version of the quote we had in English today. Just think about it. And then theres, "I can handle anything you throw down, so give me all you've got."  So, tonight I have jazz band. Fun. But until then I've got nothing to do so I'll probably just be right here. Right now I'm listening to older stuff from The Early November and talking to Gavin.  By the way, there is a new thing on here where you can post comments (at the end of the post). Feel free to do that. And say anything, nothing will bother me.

      So I went to my grandma's house and ate pizza and then just watched tv and was anti-social. It's just better that way. Well I'm checking out this band called Get Up Kids now. Has anyone ever heard them? If you have please tell me what you think of them. From the lyrics I'm reading they seem pretty good. And I would like to give a congrats to Jon for getting a scholarship to RIT and being in the paper! lol  Well, right now I'm talking to Eric, Josh, Jon, and Molly and reading lyrics from Get Up Kids. I'll give ya a sample of the stuff that I like so far:   Keep the light on in the window For the time that I am gone And when this all is over You will never be alone Keep your head up So you know When you wake up  I'll be home  -All That I Know-   i'm watching you fall from grace  breaking a heart of gold  don't ever try saving face  run with your heart of stone  don't keep waiting up for me  don't keep hoping i'll come home   -Fall From Grace-   This isn't what i wished for This isn't what i knew What can waiting do?  -Let The Reigns Go Loose-   Do hope I won't  Learn to make  The same mistakes,  That you would  Make me aware  That only fear,  My only hope,  Is letting go.  -Overdue-   Just wait till tomorrow.  I guess that's what they all say  just before they fall apart.  -Regret-  More later when I find out if I actually like them or not...

      Last night I watched Win A Date With Tad Hamilton! and Honey and today I watched Big Fish. They were all ok movies. There was a quote in Win A Date...that I liked "Love you get over with in two months. Big love- 2 years. And great love, well great love changes you life forever." Or something like that. Well, I know for sure that for me, it wasn't just love because it's been two months. Eh, whatever, life goes on and everyday is one step closer to truely being happier. (Maybe?)  So I went to see my grandma Hoover today. It's the first time I've seen her since she went into the nursing home. I feel so sad when I think about things like that so I'm not going to talk about it anymore.  In a little while I'm going to my other grandma's house for pizza with my mom, Emily, my grandma, aunt, and Paige. Should be a blast (not). Well, atleast I get pizza out of the deal.  I really don't want to go to school tomorrow. I would do anything to get out of ever having to go again.  Right now, I'm just listening to HIM and realizing how much of a friggen loser I am and how boring my life has become. Oh well, nothing I can really do to change that. I choose to stay home and not go out because I don't want to see anyone so I guess it's my fault.  Song:  The world was on fire, no-one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you And I'd never dreamed that I'd need somebody like you     No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart   No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart ..with you   What a wicked game to play    To make me feel this way    What a wicked thing to do    To let me dream of you    What a wicked thing to say  You never felt this way  What a wicked thing you do  To make me dream of you     No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart  No I don't wanna fall in love this world is always gonna break your heart ..with you  The world was on fire, no-one could save me but you It's strange what desire will make foolish people do No and I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you I'll never dream that I lose somebody like you, no  Now I wanna fall in love This world is always gonna break your heart Now I wanna fall in lust This world is always gonna break your heart ..with you  Nobody loves no-one -Wicked Game- HIM ---oh, how true...

      Wow it's been a while so let's see if I can remember everything.  Thursday- School. I don't really remember much of it. And I got out of school early to go to Kim's softball game in Hannibal. They lost 6-8. It was a good game though. They should have won but that's ok. Then we went to an all you can eat buffet and there were a bunch of Menninites (Amish people) there and they smelled bad. Right Carol? Well, atleast the food was good. I ended up getting home around 9:30.   Friday- I went to Spanish and did nothing. Then we left to go to Fulton for majors fest. I wish I went to that school. There are so many good looking guys there. We had some fun flirting with the cute guys. Dave had a big fat guy blow him a kiss. That was nasty. I always have fun at those kinda things. I got home around 6:30 and then drove back to school at 7:30 to pick up Emily. Then I just sat at home and did nothing for the rest of the night. Fun right?  Today- I rode my bike down to Ward's with Carol and Kim. Then I went back to their house and hung out for a while. Then I came back here and watched some tv until I got bored of that. Now I'm just online listening to Rise Against. Later I don't think I'm doing anything or tomorrow either so if anyone wants to do anything just let me know.  Listening to: [Voices Off Camera by Rise Against]  can you hear the desperate cries that are calling out your name? twisting your arms, holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve, do you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?  I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now   I can't bear the thought of losing,   I dread the attention winning brings   and ever since the day I came I can stand without your strings    I'm so sick of all these people   but I'm scared to be alone    and if this life has taught me anything I forgot it long ago  and so I  I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes    the heart is something you can't control we either choose to follow or be left on our own so we're leaving here on a less-travelled road as desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close, getting close    I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes I hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight, I swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

      So today was a good day. I feel as if I'm being pulled in 3 different directions though. It's confusing. I can't explain. One minute I'll feel so strongly about something and then the next I don't. It's strange, I know. Well, I had a long talk with Carol today in study hall about the *boys*. And it helped a lot for her to just listen to it. Today was my first day of sitting first for wind ensemble. I love it. I had a test in English today that I think I did really good in. And my bus ride home was extremely uneventful. Carol is still trying to convince me that this guy is perfect for me. She seems happier about it than I am.  Tomorrow I'm leaving school 15 minutes early to go to Kim's softball game in Hannibal. I won't be back until late. Then Friday I'm going to majors fest and will be back around 6 (?).  We got this new music magazine for free in the mail today. It's called Spin or something like that. It has some cool stuff in it. I cut a lot of stuff out and put it on my door to my room. My favorite is an ad for a bunch of my favorite bands on a cd called Rock Against Bush Vol. 1.   So, right now I'm just listening to random music that I have on my computer and downloading Rise Against.   Listening to: [I Want To Hear You Sad by The Early November]  These eyes are strongly covered in disguise We're waiting on the real Time again you'll see That no one knows for sure  CHORUS:   For all of this I'm better off without you Do you regret all your loneliness?    This ride is drifting slowly to the side We're swerving off the road Going past the cones That warned us from the start  CHORUS [x2]  Every day goes, every night goes [repeat]  On and on we sing a song A tired day that's oh so long Every night I sing this song for you  CHORUS [x2]

      It's been a while since I updated so here we go:  Yesterday - School. I don't remember much about it. Then I went to the girl's track meet with Danielle. All I'll say is that it was some fun times because I don't want to explain everything. Then I went to jazz band and finally got home around 9.    Today - Was actually good. I missed Chemistry and Chem lab so I was happy. I had to play for the voting day thing. Then we played catch phrase in study hall! It was so much fun. Danielle, Jenny, and I are awesome catch phrasers right!? Lots of fun times in that study hall today. Then I stayed after school and chatted with Carol about the guy I like (kinda) and just hung out with everyone. Carol is convinced that this guy is perfect for me for some reason. (???) I don't even know if I like him. Then we played at the voting thing for jazz band. Then I talked to Carol on the phone for a little while when I got home and now I'm online.  Oh, and big news, I'm sitting first for wind ensemble for the rest of the year (?) because Erica is in the hospital. I feel bad for her because it's her senior year and all and it's gotta suck big time.  Thoughts: [I hate how people make little things seem like a big deal.] [Popcorn is a type of soda.] (catch phrase) Right Danielle? [A baby sheep is a LAMB not a FAWN.] (catch phrase)  No song for today because I'm on my mom's part of the computer so I'm not listening to anything right now.

      So today, I went shopping with my mom and bought a white shirt for majors fest on Friday. And then I drove home. Then for the rest of the day I've just been sitting around watching random things on tv. Oh, what a fun life I have.  I've found a band that's really good. They are called Rise Against. Their lyrics are very meaningful and not about the normal crap. In fact the title of this post is a lyric from their song called Black Masks & Gasoline.  So right now, I'm just talking to Josh and Molly and listening to Rise Against.  School tomorrow, ugh, kill me now.  Listening to: [To The Core by Rise Against]  If I could paint how I feel, I'd draw bullseye on your forehead my anger is not misdirected unless it somehow misses you  time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away  so cast the stones that I'll gladly catch and I'll throw them right back, I stand behind the things I say, you type the words you won't say to my face  time spent on hate, is time gone to waste , I watch you point and click your life away  it seems you've let me go again, just like the day you let me in, the best of intentions, you were never mine to begin with  so step away from the fucking screen, see a world outside your scene, maybe then you will know and realize the lack of threat you pose

      It sucks really bad. I've been sleeping all day. I didn't get up until 3. I hate it. I always get sick whenever we have a day off of school.! I've been thinking a lot when I've actually been awake today. I hate thinking. I get depressed when I think.  Well, right now I'm talking to Gavin. First time in a long time. Wow, I miss that boy. I just don't know what it is about him that draws me to him. I love him so much and just want him to be happy. If he's happy then I'm going to try very hard to be happy for him.  So many things are running through my mind right now. I don't even know how to express them in words.

       Yesterday - I went to school to play tennis with Carol and Kim. It was fun but I hurt my hand really bad.   Today - I just don't know what to say about today. I guess you could say it sucked. If you want to know why then you can just ask but I'm not going to take the time to write all of it in here. All I'll say is that a couple of my friends (or so they are called) flirt really badly with the guy that I like. That's all I'm going to say about that because it's to upsetting to relive. Well, spring fling was fun for about the first half an hour. Then it all went to crap. Oh, and I saw Heather's prom pictures today. I realized I have no physical attraction towards Gavin whatsoever anymore. I still love him with all my heart though.  Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here. My friends betray me. My family could care less about me. Guys don't like me. I'm just "average" at everything.  By the way, I'm over this whole stupid thing. I'm just going to forget about this because he's not worth it and I hate everything. I'm just going to go back into my depressing phase and stop eating and harm myself again.  Just to make this clear: I AM COMPLETELY OVER LIKING THIS PERSON! He is not worth it at all. And by the way, I don't stare at him in spanish. He's just to vain and thinks that everyone wants him. Well, guess what, here's a little awakening, not everyone likes you. In fact I'm suprised that anyone does. I don't know what I was thinking when I liked him. I must have been on hyponotized or something.  Oh wow, how I change emotions so quickly. This was written over the course of an hour.   Listening to: [All Downhill From Here by New Found Glory]  You’re hiding something, ‘cause it’s burning through your eyes I try to get it out, but all I hear from you are lies  [Pre-Chorus:] And I can tell you’re going through the motions I figured you were acting out your part  Once again, we’re playing off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end?  [Chorus:]  Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it’s all downhill from here And it’s all downhill from here    Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness  Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss (Let’s go!)  [Pre-Chorus]  [Chorus]   And I can’t believe you pulled it off again Or notice till it all sets in You’ll deny it ‘til you’re at your bitter end   [Pre-Chorus]  [Chorus]   And you keep pulling me down!  (pulling me down) (pulling me down)  You contradict the fact that you still want me around  And it’s all downhill from here And it’s all downhill from here

       Yesterday - School. It wasn't to bad I guess. After school I just hung out with Carol and Kim for a while and then went home and watched American Idol. I'm so pissed that fantasia won. She sounds like a mix between Macy Gray and Mickey Mouse on drugs. I want to punch her in the face everytime she opens her mouth. Oh, and I drove around yesterday for a while with my mom.   Today - School again. It was ok I guess. I got a lot of compliments today on how I looked (cause I look sexy lol yea right like that will ever happen). I heart compliments. Dave told me that I was shiny today and that I almost gave him a seisure.lol And everyone said I looked cute today. OKKKK... Now I'm just listening to music. Later I'm going to hang out with Carol and Kim again probally. Or my mom said we might go to the city to look for a new matress for me. Not that I'll sleep in my room anyways because I don't like being alone at all.  Listening to: [A Favor House Atlantic by Coheed and Cambria] Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could  Recall the moments that once have  Retrack the footsteps that brought us to this favor  I wouldn't ask this of you   Good eye, sniper  I shoot, you run  The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know the end of us all   Run quick, they're behind us  Didn't think we'd ever make it  This close to safety in one piece  Now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe  Save us from sleep and what we are   Good eye, sniper  Now I shoot, you run  The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know the end of us all   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.   The words you scribbled on the walls  With the loss of friends you didn't have  I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out?  For them all to know   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.   Bye bye beautiful  Don't bother to write  Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars  Face step, let down.  Face step, step down.

      Dan just asked me 3 questions. Here are the questions and my answers to them.  1.Close your eyes and put everything out of your mind. you are in a tropical rain forest, there's nobody else around, just you and the forest. describe your thoughts and feelings.  ANSWER:um i wanna see a monkey and i wish i could live somewhere this warm and i wish someone was with me so i wasnt alone. MEANING: that rain forest really represents how you feel when your mind is at peace. So I don't like to be alone. True  2.now, you are in a totally white room. no windows, no doors, no people, just a room with nothing in it...except you. again, describe your thoughts and feelings. ANSWER:i wish i had some paint...blue paint...so i could paint the walls so they arent white and how am i going to get out? and i think im going to go crazy if i have to be in a white room any longer MEANING:the white room. this represents how you interpret death. The blue paint means I wish I could make death more pleasant. True  3. name your favorite body of water and why you like it so much ANSWER:ocean because i like the smell of the salt in the air and i like the sound of the waves and i feel calm and peaceful MEANING:the body of water you chose, an ocean, is how you see your love life. When I'm in love I feel calm and peaceful.  I guess that's pretty much me.

      Today was ok. It was good until 6th periodish. Things people do just bother me sometimes. Other than that it was good. I have a plan with Heather and Brianna to kick some butt, some bitch butt. We hate her. She's a hoe. Also, I hate it when people flirt with the guy that I like when they know that I like him. It's gay. I had some good convos with some cool people today. (if you know what I mean) So I actually kinda don't mind school anymore. Crazy huh? Carol's here and Emily's looking through last year's year book to try and figure out who I like. I'm going to let Carol talk in here now.  So here's Carol: sup alll ya'all out theres!!just chillin w my peeps you know!! yeah i was kinda crazy today my personal property was violated by a couple of freshman (and no not that kind of property)lol anyways yeah i need to find someone i think i should take out an add in the paper white female 16 looking for a person to chill with have fun has to be somewhat good looking nice smile likes music is funny and likes giraffes!   So that's all for now. What to do today? I don't know. Any suggestions?? lol If only I had that certain boy here. Cause he's a hottie with one of the best bodies I've ever seen. And Carol agrees.   Emily still can't figure out who it is.  Carol's choice of song today: [Big Yellow Taxi by Counting Crows and Vanessa Carlton]  [Adam Duritz] They paved paradise and put up a parking lot With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot Don't it always seem to go    That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  [Vanessa Carlton] Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bop  [Adam] They took all the trees, and put em in a tree museum And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them No, no, no Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot  [Vanessa] Ooooh, bop bop bop Ooooh, bop bop bop  [Adam] Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT I don't care about spots on my apples, Leave me the birds and the bees Please Don't it always seem to go   That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone   They paved paradise and put up a parking lot Hey now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot Why not?

      I just love being back-stabbed. It's the thing I love most in the world. I would like to thank my friends for giving me what I love so much. You guys are the best.  Well, today, was overall not a bad day besides that. My back hurts really bad though. Well, 3rd period study hall was the best one I've ever had. I heart hearing stories from Molly.  So if you can't tell, I'm feeling a little bit of animosity towards people in general right now. I wouldn't be a good time to mess with me right now because, and this is a promise, you will go down just like the others. Don't get on my bad side. I'm a bitch when you push me to be.  But really, I'm a nice person to the people I love. lol  Well, right now I'm talking to Dan and Danielle and listening to CKY and I'm eating dinner.  Listening to: [Attached At The Hip by CKY]  failed attempts have turned us into one pathetic twisted wreck all is eerie, you're standing near me I feel you breathing down my neck    you don't need to be so shallow  turn your head prepare to follow   deep incision operation the tortured one becoming two involuntary, solitary it's nice to have a point of view  dependency separate we never will be attached at the hip to me separate we never will be when there's no privacy separate we'll never be seen attached at the hip to me (attached at the hip to me, attached at the hip to me) a part of my anatomy  you don't need to be so shallow  turn your head prepare to follow  have you ever seen another lying in a pool of blood?  separate we never will be attached at the hip to me separate we never will be  when there's no privacy separate we'll never be seen attached at the hip to me (attached at the hip to me, attached at the hip to me) a part of my anatomy

      Boredom. I hate it. Well I'm going to the mall at 1:30 with Carol and we are going to see Shrek 2 lol. If anyone wants to do anything later (after 6ish) then give me a call cause I'm just going to be really bored all day.   I was thinking evil thoughts and wishing the power would go out so badly last night. It would have been awesome.  Well, right now I'm talking to Dan and listening to Less Than Jake.   Listening to: [The Science Of Selling Yourself Short by Less Than Jake]  I've come to my senses, That I've become senseless, I could give you lessons on how to ruin your friendships, Every last conviction, I smoked them all away, I drank my frustrations down the drain, out of the way,  So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?"  Someone so tired of their routines and disappearing self-esteems,  [Chorus:] I'll sing along, Yeah with every emergency, Just sing along, I'm the king of catastrophies, I'm so far gone, That deep down inside I think it's fine by me, I'm my own worst enemy  I could be an expert on co-dependency, I could write the best book on underage tragedy, I've been spending my time at the local liquor store, I've been sleeping nightly on my best friends kitchen floor,  So I sit and wait and wonder, "Does anyone else feel like me?"  I'm so over-dosed on apathy and burnt out on sympathy.  [Chorus]   Let the meaning slip away Lost my faith in another day, Self deprication seems okay, I never thought I'd make it anyway   [Chorus]   I'm my own worst enemy  [x5]

      Well, actually I could name a couple of places that I'd rather be.  Molly asked me to go to the movies with her, Tom, Heather, and some guy today. So the only way I can go though is if I find a date. I know who I want to ask but I don't know if I'll talk to him or not today. And he would probally say no anyways so...yeah. So I probally won't be doing anything tonight. Ohh what another typical Friday night.   I'm sick of the normal. I want something more, something exciting, something worth talking about.  Can anyone believe that there's only 7 more days of school left? It's krazie stuff.  So I'll be around here. If I'm not online and you want to do something just give me a call. And if I'm online I'll probally have an away message up so leave a message if you heart me!  Listening to: [All We Ever Needed by The Early November]  Tonight is a story of love Two broken hearts set by one And all he wants is a sign Of how she's making her mind All we ever wanted was  CHORUS: Love and love and happy afternoons Watching TV from your room While you're laying in my arms And I know it's not fair to me To see this love walk right by me every day Will we ever meet the right way  Again, again  Tonight I will sit next to you To see if you act like we're through To make you laugh is all I want I'll hold you while tears fill our eyes  CHORUS [x2]  Again, again  Oh, how true.  And for everyone's viewing pleasure...another song! [Sunday Drive by The Early November]  And we wait above a road We're turning to go home And the silence from the side of the car Tells me everything and how we are  There's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying tonight  CHORUS:  And you know it's not so easy when you're all alone And I wonder if I'm alone in your head  I know something is wrong,  I just don't know what to do  You say it's only me and that I'm so perfect for you I don't want to try no more I don't want to make this right I just want you to be true to me one time   CHORUS   Twelve days gone by since I have saw you last I'll give this one more try I'll give it all my best and I'll ask What could you be doing that is so much fun? Without me by your side Without me by your side    And I'll take a step back and I'll let you ahead And I will take a step away and see if you come back Because there's no more trying to make it so right There's no more trying, there's no more trying tonight     We'll never be the same   We will never be the same We will never be the same We will never be the same Until you're done

      So Gavin was online and he asked me if I wanted to go to Ward's with him. So we went to Ward's and got ice cream. Then we drove around and went to Father Webber's house and hung out for a while. Then he drove me home. But I didn't even get shotty 'cause stupid Gregg was there (sad face). And I didn't get a hug good-bye either (another sad face). Oh well I still had fun. Atleast I got out of working on my project for a while. So now I'm working on my project (not fun) and listening to Less Than Jake.  Listening to: [Ghosts Of You And Me by Less Than Jake]  I've been down wandering past 2nd street and looking at the ghosts of you and me and thinking back on all those memories of how we used to be  I've been hearing hear those voices of the noises of the breaking glass and all those plans we had to get us through they're never coming true  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  The ghosts of you and me 'cause I'm just a long-gone memory and you're still alive and I'm still getting by on these dead end streets the ghosts of you and me  I'm still talking talk of what we'll do to the ghosts of me and you and I'm still looking back into the past when we were all we had  And I hope and hope that you won't forget and I hope you, hope you know that I can clearly see  [Chorus] the ghosts of you and me [x2]  Hope you won't forget hope you know that I'll always regret those things I said hope you know that I can clearly see  [Chorus] the ghosts of you and me [x3]  Yeah

       Today - How much more boring could this possibly get? School is always the same. Nothing exciting happens. For once I wish something different would happen. Tomorrow is Friday! (Woohoo) I have Dinner Dance on Sunday. Anyone can go if they want to. It's at the Hulbert House in Boonville at 5 o'clock. I think I have a solo that I've only played once. It's My Heart Will Go On. "I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go (as she lets go-what a lieing whore-if you say you'll never let go then you shouldn't!)."  I have senioritis so badly already. I can't wait until this summer and all of next year. It's just going to be one big party! I'm hoping I can get a car by August. I have $1,300 saved in the bank for a car and I'll be working this summer and should get about $400 (?) more. Maybe I could buy a used Mini Cooper. That would be the shit!  So right now I'm talking to Gavin and Jon and listening to all the music on my computer.  Listening to: [A Favor House Atlantic by Coheed and Cambria] (lyrics already on here)

      Does anyone realize what today is? Does anyone know any good songs I should download?   Yesterday - Was not bad I guess. I don't remember much about school. Later in the night I went back to school though to play tennis with Carol and Kim. Then it started raining so we went inside for an hour until jazz band. We made up a game called smoguntiger. It's so stupid it's funny. Then jazz band was not badish. We got cupcakes and ice cream for Ian's b-day. It was yummy.   Today - Was just another average day. The radio in the cafeteria is finally working so we got to listen to K-Rock during study hall and lunch and stuff today. I had a lesson with Linz today so I got out of English. That's always good. Then there was a field hockey meeting after school. I can't wait till season starts. It's going to be so much fun next year. So we just talked about summer league and preseason and stuff. I'm going to start running tomorrow so I can be inshape and we get to use the weight room over the summer on Tuesdays and Thursdays! I'm so excited. I'm going to be strong! lol Well then Kera's mom gave me a ride home. Then I talked to Carol for a bit on the phone and now I'm here. Oh joy. Well, I've got to go clean my room now because I have a new matress comming tomorrow! Yay maybe, just maybe, I'll actually sleep in my own room now.  Thoughts:  [You can't break me down, You can't control me.] [Don't chastise me for anything I do. I make my own decisions and  I  am the one that must suffer the consequences,  not you .]   Listening To: [Anthem Of Our Dying Day by Story Of The Year]  The stars will cry The blackest tears tonight And this is the moment that I live for I can smell the ocean air And here I am Pouring my heart onto these rooftops Just a ghost to the world That's exactly Exactly what I need  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat Cause I never Never have before  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Of our dying day Of our dying day Of our dying!!!  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city And you gasp for air tonight!!  From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Our dying day Of our dying!!!

      Um...today was boring as hell. I'm so confused about everything that's going on right now. I just wish I had someone that I could talk to that understands me. Someone that won't judge me on my past and won't form misconceptions of who I really am. Wow, what to say? I'm at a complete loss for words right now.   I hate the way some people see me. They don't even get to know me before they form a negative opinion on me. If you got to know me, who knows, maybe you would actually like me.

      Well, last night I went to Wards with Gavin. Then we just drove around for a while and then sat outside my house and talked. We talked about everything from school to prom to music to where we are at. We were just catching up on what's been going on in the past 3 months. I guess I realized that we can be good friends after all that happened. It was great. And not awkward  at all . Ok, so maybe some of it was awkward. I had a lot of fun actually. Basically, I'm not planning out anything. I'm saying whatever happens happens. I can't say that we are going to get back together or even hang out again for a while. I'd like to hang out again sometime but I'm not going to force anything. All I know is that I had fun for once and I hope Gavin did too. Gavin left around 12:30 and I came inside to questions from my mom. "What were you doing?" and "You aren't getting back together with him are you?" and "What could you possibly talk about for 4 hours?" and questions like that. I hated it. I know that she just doesn't want to see me get hurt again because she cares.  And to all my friends. Please don't yell at me for doing this. If you tell me not to do something it's just going to make me rebel against you and want to do this even more. You are my friends and I respect you opinion but if I am going to make mistakes you can't stop me. I will just have to learn from my mistakes.  So, right now I'm just downloading music. Then later I am going to look for a new matress with my mom when she gets home from church. But I will be home later tonight if anyone wants to do anything because I'm just going to be bored again. Then tomorrow I'm going to be bored again.  Listening to: [Memory by Sugarcult]   This may never start. We could fall apart. And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear.  Feelings insincere.  Can I be your memory?     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. I'll tear us apart. Cannot be your enemy. Losing half a year. Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything.     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. Tearing out my heart. I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. (I'd be your memory) Feelings disappear.  Can I be your memory?     So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.    This may never start. We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. Feelings insincere.  Can I be your memory ?

       Yesterday - Was definetly better than the day before. It still wasn't the greatest but it was better. We had block scheduling in school. I basically did nothing all day. Then after school Carol, Danielle, Sarah, Kate, Mike, James, and Billy all went to Ward's and got ice cream and then we went to Palm Springs mini golfing. It was so much fun. Carol, Mike, and I thought we went to the wrong mini golf place because noone was there for a while. We thought everyone got lost but they didn't. In mini golfing I got a 47. Which isn't to bad. The other team cheated though! Then after mini golfing Carol, Mike, and I went and got soda and chips from Eckerds and Gavin's cousin Amanda was there. So I talked to her for a couple of minutes. She invited me to her and Gavin's graduation party but I don't know if I'll go. (probally not) Then everyone went back to Mike's house and played pool for a while and then played basketball. The girl's team was the awesomest team ever. (even though we lost) Danielle hurt her finger (sad face). I hope your finger feels better Danielle! Then after a while I went home.   Today - My cousin Greg got married. So I went to Oriskany for the wedding. I like weddings. There's always a good supply of cute guys there. lol Then after that we went to Applebee's and then I drove home.  So later tonight my cousin's daughter Makenzie and my other cousin's kids Dominic and Aubree are going to be here. So I'm going to be watching them I guess. Oh joy.   And then tomorrow I'm doing absolutely nothing. And I probally won't get asked to do anything either because that's just the way things happen. I hate not having plans sometimes. I get insanely sad when I don't do anything on weekends for some reason. I guess it's because I know most of my friends are off hanging out with their good friends and I'm not doing anything. Oh well. Hopefully this summer I will get a car so I can go places.  2 more days of school left. I don't know if I'm excited or sad. Probally a little more excited right now. Summer=more freedom=more fun. But then again summer could =loneliness which = boredom which = depressedness.  Listening to: [Counting Stars by Sugarcult]  Hey, I wanna crawl out of my skin Apologize for all my sins All the things I should have said to you Hey, I can't make it go away Over and over in my brain again All the things I should have said to you  [Chorus:]  Counting stars wishing I was okay  Crashing down was my biggest mistake I never ever ever meant to hurt you I only did what I had to  Counting stars again   Hey, I'll take this day by day by day Under the covers I'm okay I guess Life's too short and I feel small  [Chorus]  Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again Counting stars again

      Do you think it doesn't kill me inside when I'm not able to even talk to my best friend? Do you think it doesn't hurt me when my "friends" do stuff with out me?  I can't even describe how I'm feeling inside anymore. For the past couple of days I've just been so down. I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning. I seriously think that if something terrible happened to me and I died right now noone would even notice that I'm gone. It's a terrible feeling to feel so alone and so hopeless. All I want to do is have *someone* hold me in their arms and just let me cry. That's really all I need right now.  Every day it gets harder and harder to pretend that I'm happy and I don't think anyone even notices how unhappy I truely am. Noone has any idea how hard it really is to literally put on a fake smile as you walk out the door in the morning and not be able to take it off until you walk back in that door. I don't even know if anyone cares. I just can't take all of this anymore. I need to get away from everything. I'm sick of everyone. I need to find some new friends that I can actually talk to about how I'm feeling. (no offence to my friends-I heart you all)  Everything is closing in around me and every day it gets harder to breathe. I'm drowning in a pool of misery. I just need to find someone that I can share this with. Just someone that understands where I'm comming from.  I just don't want to talk to anyone anymore. There's only one person that I feel I can talk to right now and that's Gavin but I can't even tell him everything.  I just hate being alone so much. I'm alone about 3 or 4 nights a week lately from 4-10 and I hate it. All I want is someone to spend that time with me. Someone to fill the void in my life. Someone to make me feel remotely happy again.  My mom hasn't been home much lately and I don't really have a father figure in my life. My mom even missed me play in the concert last night for the first time ever. You have no idea how much that hurt me. There's noone home to guide me in the right direction and I feel like I took a wrong turn a long time ago and I'm just completely lost.  I try to cry. But I can't. My emotions just continue to build up inside of me and I become more wreckless every day.  When will I hit rock bottom? Or is this an bottomless pit?  [Out Of Control by Hoobastank]  I've done everything as you say I've followed your rules without question I thought it would help me see things clearly But instead of helping me to see I look around and it's like I'm blinded  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you I don't understand what you want from me  I feel like I'm spinning out of control Try to focus but everything's twisted  And all along I thought you would be there (Thought you would be there) To let me know I'm not alone But in fact that's exactly what I was   I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you All of the things you've said to me  I may never know the answer To this endless mystery  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me  Is it a mystery? Is it a mystery?  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control...  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me Cause I don't know If I can trust you All the things you've said to me  And I may never know the answer To this endless mystery  Where should I go? What should I do? I don't understand what you want from me  I'm spinning out of control Out of control I'm spinning out of control Out of control

      So today- One of the last days of school this year. How sad. I'm going to miss everyone so much. Archery was really fun in gym today. And study hall was fun too. We took pictures for Carol's French project. There's a really good one of me, Kevin, Danielle, and Kayla. I'll post it on here once Carol gives me a copy of it.  Well, I was supposed to go to Josh's with Kim to go swimming but then it started raining so we didn't go. So now I'm just talking to Gavin and listening to music.  Concert tonight at 7:30. Come watch if you want.  Oh, and tomorrow night is the National Honors Society dinner. I will serve those seniors their food and I will serve it well. lol  Listening to: [What You Say by Sugarcult]  Wait around, If the fires there to put it out. Lay me down, Emotions overrated now, rated now.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Wait around, To pick up lines to put me down. Scream and shout, Make it up to make it out, to make it out.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Lay me down, Emotions overrated now. Wait around, If the fires there to put me out.  I dont wanna hear another word you say. I dont ever wanna waste another day. What you say what you say what you never say. Every single lie and youre afraid.  Let me let, me out. Get me get, me out. Let me let, me out. Get me get, me out.  Wait around, If the fires there to put it out, Put me out, put it out.

      Um...so yeah today was boring as usual. I got my year book today. It's okish this year. I'm in it a lot. Nothing else exciting happened today. It was just another boring day of school that I wish I never had to go through. It sucks and I hate it. I don't know why but all day today all I've wanted to do was cry and have someone tell me that everything is going to be ok. And it just helps  so  much that I just got to talk to Gavin for only 5 mins and I didn't even get to tell him anything. I was going to ask him if he wanted to do something tonight too. He probally would have said no but I guess I'll never know now.  I guess that is just my sad self talking. School actually wasn't horrible today. There were a couple of good parts. Like my double-lunch today and study hall with Molly, Heidi, Heather, Kayla, and Lisa. "It's like a pillow. Do you blow them up sometimes?"-Heather (don't ask) That was probally the best part of the day though. I do like signing everyone's yearbooks though.  Ohh how I hate my life.  Listening to: [Head Up by Sugarcult]  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful When they say give up Turn up your radio All the sentimental memories you own When they say grow up It’s just like a funeral  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful Keep your head up It’s all right in front of you When they say wake up You’re braking ridicule When all the sentimental memories you own  Keep you trapped inside your room there all alone  And it feels like It feels like you’re lost And it feels like It feels like you’re lost  Is there some way you can be out on your own?   Trust yourself Don’t waste another day at all    On your own  Keep your head up The colors are beautiful And it feels like It feels like you’re lost And it feels like It feels like you’re lost  Is there some way you can be out on your own? Trust yourself Don’t waste another day at all  Watch this fade away Everything fades away Keep your head up The colors are beautiful

      That I wish I had a car. My mom won't be home until 9 tonight. How the hell am I supposed to eat?! I definetly can't cook for me and Emily. I would burn the food and she wouldn't make anything I like. What am I going to do? Ohhh no! This is not good. Anyone have any suggestions?  Well, today was Monday. I hate Mondays. What else can I say about it? 6 more days of school left. I'm kind of sad and kind of excited at the same time. We get our yearbooks tomorrow. I got a peek at a senior's today and they looked pretty good this year. I'm in a couple (4 or 5 that I know of so far) of the candid photos. I'm starting to not mind having my picture taken for some reason. I still don't like it much but I don't hate it anymore.  So I'm just going to be around here all day. Mom-less and car-less. So if anyone wants to take me out to eat for dinner later that would  be great and I would love you forever. lol  Listening to: [Champagne by Sugarcult]  All I can taste is champagne When it hits the brain like cocaine Spinning around and around I can’t get up without your help I’m falling down  All I can taste is champagne Another day down the drain Sleeping around and around I can’t wake up without your help It’s over now  You want it You need it You can’t explain it You fight it You beat it I can’t live without you I’m moving on without you   Love is like Novocain And it leaves a little stain The beauty in all this pain is I can’t get away from you  So bowl me down and don’t make a sound    You want it You need it You can’t explain it You fight it You beat it I can’t live without you I’m moving on without you   All I can taste is champagne Dancing away down my veins Spinning around and around I can’t get up without your help I’m on the ground   Somebody help me I’m loosing everything when I’m without you Doing it without you   All I can taste is champagne Another day down the drain All I can taste is champagne

      Why can't anyone see me for the person I really am and just accept me? I'm not the person  anyone  thinks I am. First impressions of me are usually bad and then people don't like me just because I'm "shy" or "rude" or "bitchy" or "inconsiderate". I'M SORRY I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT WHEN I FIRST MEET SOMEONE OK?! I don't understand how anyone can form an opinion about me unless they talk to me. I'm not a bad person. I can't be mean to anyone unless I'm pushed to be. So why don't people like me? Why do they think I'm a bad person? I would never intentionally do anything to hurt anyone, even if I hate them. If you just sat down and had a conversation with me then you would understand where I'm coming from and maybe even like me. I just hate how people don't like me and think I'm a bad person when they don't even talk to me. I'm sorry but is it a crime that I don't want to be like everyone else? Is it bad that I'm different?  I know what people think of me. I'm not dumb or blind, I see how people look at me. They think:   "OMG look at that Kelly girl, she wears black that means she's goth."   No, I'm not. I wear black sometimes. Oh My God that's a crime and I should be hated for it. Or,   "Kelly tries to hard to be what she's not, a punk."   Well, I don't label myself or anyone. I don't consider myself goth, punk, prep, or anything. I am who I want to be. Or then theres,   "Kelly's a bitch because she (insert something bitchy here)."   Well, I'm sorry but I just don't know how to talk to some people ok? If I don't talk to you it's not because I'm a bitch. I think my friends would tell you that I'm not. I don't talk to some people because they either intimadate me, or I don't know them and am to shy to talk to them. And you can't forget the   "Oh Kelly? Yeah I talk to her sometimes and she's pretty cool, but I don't consider her my friend and would never hang out with her outside of school."   Well, all I have to say to that is, I don't care what anyone thinks of me. I am who I am and noone is going to change me. If you get to know me and don't like me then ok, don't talk to me anymore. But if you judge me before you get to know me then you are just like everyone else and that is boring.  Well, on to other things. Today I have dinner dance at the Hulbert House in Boonville at 5. Go if you love me! It's $15 by the way. Before dinner dance I'll just be finishing my AP project and just hanging out around here. Oh how fun. Not really.  Listening to: [Worst December by Sugarcult]  It’s a big mistake 50 days, 3 months away I’d be laughing today But your voice on the phone gives me no reason  Don’t take from me My heart is barely beating Don’t take from me I’m falling down  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  It’s a different day 1500 miles away Why would you want to stay? So take a look around  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  All I want to do is to be close to you All I want to do is to be next to you All I want is you to give up all we had to be I can’t remember why I’m here If you’d let me spend my life with you  December’s gone It came and went  All I really need is you I’m waiting here for you December’s gone It came and went

      Ugh, I hate being home alone. I guess it's going to start happening a lot more now though. Which definetly sucks really bad.  So today I'm not doing much of anything so I think I'm going to call Kim up later and see if she wants to go running with me. I got to get in shape for field hockey now or I'll procrastinate and be hurting really bad during pre-season. Or maybe I'll go shopping when my mom gets home. Hm...the choices. Well, I'll probally end up doing nothing so if anyone wants to do anything just call.  Tomorrow is Remsen graduation and then Gavin's and Jon's party. Then Monday is Chemistry review from 10-12 and then Math review from 1-4. Oh fun a whole day of review!  Listening to: [Just Let Me Cry by Ashlee Simpson]  I'm about to lose control  I, I don't know why Why you need some reason to feel lost inside You, you know that I'm alright  You know that I'm just the kind of girl that feels so hurt and smiles   I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry   Yeah I loved you all my life You don't even know a thing I feel inside No, by the look in my eye That I'm just fine but I might need you to hold me tight   I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I 'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry I had a bad day, I'll cry if I want to, cry if I want to, cry  Just let me.... cry  Just let me cry, I'm crying, I'm breaking down......... I'm breaking down just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry  I don't use excuses Don't ask why It's just a breakdown It happens all the time So get out of my face Don't even try Ya wanna help me, just let me cry

      Today wasn't to bad. Had the last half of the English regents today. I think I did pretty well. Then Carol, Kate, Danielle, Sarah, Heather, Kayla, Bill, Mike, James, and I all went to Grandes for lunch. After that Kate, Carol, and I went back to Kate's house for a second and almost got killed by Bill throwing pizza at the car and passing a Corvette on a hill. Then Carol, Kate, Mike, Bill, James, and I all went back to Mike's and hung out. It was..um..interesting. The boys locked us out of the house. That was not fun. We went swimming and played basketball and tons of fun stuff like that. Then I came home and ate dinner and now I'm online.   Tomorrow I'm not doing much of anything that I know of yet. Then Sunday is Remsen graduation and Gavin's and Jon's graduation parties. I don't know if Carol is going to go with me so I might have to go alone to both.  This is a really funny site... urlLink www.illwillpress.com ...go to toons and watch foamy's rant 2.   urlLink Also go here    To Some People You May Be Beautiful But To Me You Are Just Another Beautiful Letdown   Listening to: [Drinking for 11 by Mad Caddies]  Drinking for eleven, that's just what i do, When i'm not with you, My heart goes to bed  End of the bar, that's just where i'll be, Don't try and come find me Cause i'm already dead  With one eye tied upon the open road I feel your presence and i can't let it go It moves so slowly as it creeps into my mind, Steals every breath i have and leaves my heart behind  Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone I wanna hear if you still care The last time i remember you was the last time i wasn't scared  When the nights start fading and the mornin' arrives  I wanna still feel you around Will you creep into my head again and pick me up off the ground Once more and tell me what you're fighting for  Gotta try gotta try for tomorrow When you can't see through today There's nowhere left to stay  Sometimes i feel like im out here all alone Just one in million stuck with no place left to go  The fear steps up to me with every move that i make Following close behind my soul it wants to take

      The first part of the English regents was today. I think I did pretty good actually. My hand has never hurt more in my life!  Well, I'd like to thank my friends for sticking around. (note the sarcasm) Carol ditches me for Jamie and talks about their plans right in front of me AND now she won't go to Gavin's or Jon's graduation with me!!! Ugh, thanks a lot. Now I'm going to have to go to both parties alone and not have anyone to hang out with at both.  To top that all off, Carol goes to Brantingham for two weeks right after graduation and I have nothing to do. And my mom just asked me if I wanted to go to Darien Lake during that time and she said I could invite a friend. And since Carol's going to be gone I have noone to invite.  Well, tomorrow I have the last half of the English regents in the morning. Lots o' fun.  I really want ice cream right now but I don't have anyone to go with.  Listening to: [You Own Disaster by Taking Back Sunday]  Just think of this and me  as just a few of many things  to lie around  to clutter up your shelves   And I wish you weren't worth the wait   because there's some thing's  I'd like to say to you...   I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing    I dare you to forget    those marks you left  across my neck from those nights when we were both  found at our best I could make this obvious,  and you, you could deny me all in one breath you could shrug me off  your shoulders...  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Just forget me it's that simple Just forget me it's that simple

       Last night - I talked to Gavin for like 2 hours. Now I have 2 graduation parties to go to on Sunday. Fun funness. I hated the aloneness though. It sucks. So if anyone wants to save me from being alone every Tuesday until like August that would be the greatest.   Today - My Dad hasn't called yet. Big suprise there. He is such a big disappointment in my life. Everyone who has a father figure in their lives don't realize how lucky you truely are, even if you don't like him, he is still there for you. I see my dad once about every 3 months. I know to some people I seem lucky for that, but a father is supposed to care and want to see his kids. The occasional dinner here or day at his house there or a birthday card with money in it every year just isn't enough for me anymore. Kids need a father figure in their life just as much as they need a mother. You don't have any idea how much it hurts me when I invite him to a concert or a field hockey or basketball game and he says he'll be there and he never shows up. Yeah, I say I hate him, but that's just so people don't see how much it hurts me not to have him in my life.  Tomorrow is the first part of the English regents. I'm nervous about it. I just want about an 85 on it and I'll be happy.  Today I'm doing nothing...again. Maybe I'll ask my mom to go shopping so I can buy Laura a b-day present for her party on Tuesday.  Oh, the other day I finally ordered a new pair of sneakers. I got them on sale from Delia's for $25! They are Vans and they're blue with a yellow and a white stripe thing. I can't wait for them to come!  Listening to: [Any Number Can Play by No Use For A Name]  They will mislead you, plug in and bleed you I swear I heard the DJ say "Swallow temptation", believe the answer Is in the order you obey  I know my purpose isn't on a poster sign I'm still part of the game that any number can play  Majority vote, identity? No! Top forty reasons to spoon feed Immunity lost, full price at your cost Industry living by disease  Imagine, idolize and idealize A dream a nighmare couldn't change Any number can play  The sound remains unclear, There's little left to hear except contradiction Looks like somebody made our mind When history repeats the hit that I've heard for my whole life  Bring back request to radio, Your favorite song was written but you'll never know A selection for us to see a blind conspiracy Another version of the imitated tune and not one soul was saved Any number can play

       Yesterday - School and shit. Athletic awards night. I got a scholar athlete award for field hockey.   Today - Oh, what a sad yet happy day. The last day of school. I am going to miss all of my senior friends and everyone that I'm not going to see over the summer. I took some good pictures of everyone today. And we didn't really do anything in any of my classes so that was good. This marking period doesn't look like it's going to be the best for me. I have some really crappy grades (for me).  There was no senior prank this year. How lame is that? I'm already thinking of some goods ones.  Well, tomorrow I might be going to my dad's house. I'm not to sure yet though. Then Thursday and Friday in the morning I have my English regents. But if anyone wants to do anything later in the day then that would be good.   So, I'm alone again. (sad face) I'm alone a lot lately. I hate it so bad. So if anyone wants to just stop by anytime before 10:00 I welcome it.  Sometimes I think I dream to big. Maybe if I didn't want so much or expect the absolute greatest then I wouldn't be crushed so badly.  Listening to: [Violence by Blink 182]  6 bottles went down the drain,  one hours waste of time,  I’d ask if you feel the same,  still pushing that chance to try,  your breath in this cool room chill,  long hair that blows side to side,  you speak and make time stand still,  and each time you walk right on by...  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after.  Can’t count all the eyes that stare,  can’t count all the things they see,  she kills with no life to spare,  just victims are left to bleed,  one drink and the pain goes down,  soft shadows lay by her feet,  lay soft as you slowly drown,  lay still while you fall asleep. (Fall asleep)  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after. (And after…and after…and after)  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me… Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me…  Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after. Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after.  [Lady Voice:]  My dearest  I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together  And will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately I've read you're letter through at least 4 times And will probably read it more times before I'm through I've been sitting here Looking at you're picture and getting more home sick every minute  I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of Except of course you, you're self   I keep thinking of you darling  I keep wishing I could be home with you I want to leave in the worst possible way so I could come home to see you But: Things don't look to good on that subject This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess  I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now   I'm completely lost without you darling   I never realized I could miss anyone person so much  I just hope it won't be too much longer till I'm able to be with you again And live a  sane  and  normal  life.

      So yesterday Joelle came over and we hung out for a while. And my cousins came over. Aubree is sooo adorable. I can't believe she's already 2. I remember when she was born. It doesn't seem that long ago. It's crazy how things have changed since then.   Well today at 5 I'm going to my cousin Paige's soccer practice to pick her up. Then we are going back to her house to swim in the pool if it's warm out enough.  Tomorrow is one of the last days of school. Hopefully one of the best too. I am getting a sports award tomorrow night! Yay me! I have to remember to bring my camera and then put all of the pics on here the next time I go to my Dad's house. I never have anything to do at my Dad's house because I don't anyone in Yorkville so I'll have all day to post all the pics I have.  So right now I'm talking to Jon. He just invited me to his graduation party next Sunday. Yay I like parties. Hopefully Carol will go with me so I have someone to go with.  Listening to: [The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out by Less Than Jake]  You told me that your 20 years have gone by much too fast And you've been hoping this year will be better than the last You said you've been waging a war against the loneliest of nights With the strongest drinks and longest lines It's not that big of a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive    So I'll let you know If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll be there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in you, I'll let you know I will    You said the hole in your head has gotten bigger than the hole that's in your chest And you're stuck between the past and the present tense You said you've been waging a war against so many years of lies With stronger drinks and longer lines It's not that big a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive    So I'll let you know If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll be there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in, I'll let you know I will

      So yesterday I babysat Paige for a while. We broke a window in their garage playing basketball. Oops. Then I came home and talked to Carol on the phone for a while. Then I went to the bowling alley and ate dinner. We had this bitchy waitress and I wanted to punch her in the face. She didn't even deserve the dollar tip my mom gave her. Then Carol and I went to the mall. I bought a purse finally. It's really cool. Then Carol and I saw The Notebook. It was so good. I cried. You could hear everyone in the theater crying. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good love story and I guarantee that you will cry.  Then today was graduation. Ohh sadness. I can't say I was overly sad though. And I can't say I'm going to miss anyone that much. I know I will miss Sarah in Wind Ensemble but other than that I don't think I will mind the seniors being gone sorry to say. Well since they just graduated that would make me a senior wouldn't it? I can't believe I'm a senior now! Well I got there, played, watched the rest of the ceremony, talked to Jon and Sarah and Kim and people when it was over. Then I went to Ward's and got ice cream and now I'm home doing nothing!  Later I think I'm going to Brian's graduation party for a little while. Other than that I'm doing absolutely nothing so if anyone wants to do anything that would be the greatest.  Tomorrow I'm either doing nothing or I'm going to my grandma's house to paint her porch and make some money.  Listening to: [Science Fiction by Rufio]  These are the whispers that you hear inside your mind Subtle yet forceful they are tearing at your side. She can't see, and I can't believe she's falling.  But I will be there helping when you call on me.  Prove it to the world you're perfect, your choking on your pride. Gonna kill yourself believing in these beautiful lies.  Don't believe this science fiction, tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes.    There's more to life than all the beauty that they sell.  Why must we always try to look like someone else? She can't see, and I can't believe she's falling. But I will be there helping when you call on me. Prove it to the world you're perfect, your choking on your pride. Gonna kill yourself believing in these beautiful lies.  Don't believe this science fiction, tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes. Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever known... Beautiful lies, are all she's ever, are all she's ever known...  Don't believe this science fiction. Tale of beauty and perfection. You are more than ordinary it's time to take this blindfold off your eyes

      So last night Gavin came over and we hung out for a while. It was tons o' fun. I hope he had fun. I really like hanging out with him. I feel like I can be myself around him which doesn't happen to often. I don't feel comfortable around that many people so I can't act myself and be who I truely am. In fact, he's the only guy I have ever been able to completely act myself around. He makes me so happy. Whenever I'm around him I can't help but smile. I'm so happy that we are still friends after all that's happened. I don't know what I would do with out him as a friend. I hope we can hang out again sometime soon.  So today I talked to Molly about everything for a while and then I got online.  Tomorrow I have to babysit my cousin Paige for a while. And then Saturday morning I have to play with jazz band for graduation.  Listening to: [Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional]  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  [Chorus] I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current  and let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      Today was the Chemistry regents. It was really easy. I was done in an hour and 25 minutes and I had to stay for 2 hours. I found out I got an 89 on the English regents. Not bad. Then I went to Laura's b-day party. Carol, Jes, Linz, Sarah, and Tara. We played b-ball, volleyball, and swam in the pool and lots o' fun stuff. I got a sun burn. Then Jes gave me a ride home in her awesome car. I want one. And I got home and my new Vans had come in. I love them. They are blue with a yellow and a greyish stripe. And now I'm home alone again for the second night in a row. This sucks ass. I hate being home alone. Does anyone want to come save me from lonliness?   Right now I'm just talking to Gavin and Jon. Later I'm doing nothing so I'll probally be online still unless someone wants to do something. And then tomorrow I'm doing nothing yet again. Oh how (not) fun. Well, I'll be around probally with an away message up. If you really want to talk to me that much just im me a couple of times and I'll probably be back eventually.  Listening to: [Baby Blue by The Early November]  It's a faster, growing green That flows through these leaves I have, I try, I guess we'll be alright  Way to try, I got a line For you from me, better nice A beautiful, baby blue Sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  CHORUS: But it's okay We'll come around With nights like this are never ending I try so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I know you want it all And you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay, for just in case that day  CHORUS  *I don't want you to love me anymore  With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me To let you go To let you go  My bags packed and ready to go But nothing's ever hurt so much for me To let you go To let you go

      So last night I went to Mike's house with Carol, Danielle, Sarah, Heather, Michelle, Mike, and James. It was tons o' fun. We played pool, basketball, phooseball (sp?) (and Carol and I beat Mike and James!), and went in the pool and hot tub. Then we went over to Ward's and got ice cream.  Today I went to my grandma's house before the Math regents. Then I went to take the Math regents. I'm pretty sure I failed it. It was really friggen hard! Then I came home and Molly called so I talked to her for a while. I heart that girl! Don't worry what everyone thinks about you Molly, if you ever need anyone to talk to I'm here for you! Then I watched Love Actually. It's a very good movie. I would recommend it. It made me think, am I ever going to find anyone that will love me unconditionally? I'm starting to think that I never will. I'm such a hopeless romantic. I just want a guy that won't treat me like crap and take time to actually get to know me and like me for who I am. Is that to much to ask for?   So right now I'm talking to Jon. Tomorrow morning is the Chemistry regents and Laura's B-day party.  Listening to: [Memory by Sugarcult]   This may never start. We could fall apart. And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear.  Feelings insincere. Can I be your memory?  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. I'll tear us apart. Can I be your enemy. Losing half a year. Waiting for you here I'd be your anything.  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. Tearing out my heart. I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. (I'd be your memory) Feelings disappear. Can I be your memory?  So get back, back, back to where we lasted. Just like I imagine. I could never feel this way. So get back, back, back to the disaster. My heart's beating faster. Holding on to feel the same.  This may never start. We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory. Lost your sense of fear. Feelings insincere. Can I be your memory?

      Today was really boring. I went to Chemistry review from 10-12. Then I went down to Grande's with Kate, Joelle, and Tara and Heather was there. Then I went up to Math review from 1-4. I got a 59 on my Math 40 week! I suck so bad. That's ok though because a lot of people did worse than me so I don't feel as bad. Plus she's going to curve them a lot I think. And when I got home I found out that everyone is going to Mike's at 5. So I'm going over there now. This should be a lot of fun.  Tomorrow is the Math regents. I'm going to fail. And then Wenesday is the Chemistry regents and Laura's b-day party.

      Today was probably one of the worst days. I've had in a while. It's not like it started off bad at all though. Well, I went to Remsen graduation. Gavin graduated! Congrats! I can't believe the little shy quiet boy I met in 7th grade has graduated. It's amazing how much we have both changed since then. I just want him to know that I am so proud of him. And Gavin seemed genuinely happy to see me at graduation. He gave me a big hug and that made me so happy.   Then I went to Jon's party and hung out for a while. That part wasn't to bad. We played soccer and stuff. It's too bad I couldn't have stayed there longer. I feel bad that I left after 45 minutes but my mom was waiting in the car.  Then I went to Gavin's party. This is where things started going downhill. I was so happy and excited to go see him. I spent extra time (about 25 minutes extra to be exact) making sure I looked good and everything and I even spent all night last night making him CD's to give him since I have no money to give to him. I get there and what happens? Gavin barely pays any attention to me at all. Way to invite me to your party and then make me feel like complete shit. I mean, I understand that he has other friends to hang out with but Carol and I didn't really know anyone there so it would have been nice to have been talked to for a couple of minutes here and there! And then to top things off some of the people I hate most were there  and  I got hit really hard in the face with a volleyball. It took all my strength to not cry. It hurt so bad (and I'm not just talking about the volleyball). I think I might had a black eye tomorrow from the volleyball though. It just seemed as if Gavin didn't even want me to be there. I feel like complete shit. I had the worst time I've had in a while there and I wish I had stayed at Jon's party longer.  I hate my life.   Today could have been one of the best days I've had in a while. Why do people have to ruin things for me and make me upset when I'm happy?  I hate holding things inside. I can't wait until Emily goes to bed so I can talk to my mom about it and just let everything out and cry. I've been holding back my tears ever since I got to Gavin's party.  Why does my life have to suck so badly? Why don't I have anyone that I can talk to? Why is it that noone wants me around anymore?  Sometimes it just doesn't seem worth it anymore to wake up in the morning.

      Today was really boring. I earned $5 though. I went and returned cans and bottles at Price Chopper with my mom and she gave me the money. And we went to Friendly's. Then I came home and talked to Molly for a while, watched tv, and now I'm online talking to Jon.  Listening to: [Dammit by Blink 182]  It's alright  to tell me  what you think  about me I won't try  to argue  or hold it  against you I know that  you're leaving  you must have  your reasons The season  is calling  and your pictures  are falling down  The steps that  I retrace  the sad look  on your face The timing  and structure  did you hear  he fucked her? A day late  a buck short  I'm writing  the report On losing  and failing  when I move  I'm flailing now  And it's happened once again I'll turn to a friend Someone that understands Sees through the master plan  But everybody's gone And I've been here for too long To face this on my own Well I guess this is growing up  Well I guess this is growing up  And maybe  I'll see you  at a movie  sneak preview You'll show up  and walk by  on the arm  of that guy And I'll smile  and you'll wave  we'll pretend  it's okay The charade  it won't last  when he's gone  I won't come back  And it'll happen once again You'll turn to a friend Someone that understands And sees through the master plan  But everybody's gone And you've been there for too long To face this on your own Well I guess this is growing up  Well, I guess this is growing up [4x] Well, I guess this is growing up

      Wow, it's been a while. Let's see if I can remember everything. I'll probably be editing this post as I remember things later.  Wednesday- Carol and I took our 5 hour. I was really good at the whole drunk goggles thing. It's crazee because I can walk a straight line with the goggles on but I can't without them on. After is was over Carol and I walked around the mall for a bit. I realized I have a thing for guys with lip peircings. I don't know why, I just find it extremely hot. I think it's the rebellious side in me. I feel as if my mom trusts me way to much (not that it's a bad thing). If she knew some things about me she wouldn't let me go anywhere for a looong time.  Thursday- I had to babysit Paige. Then we went up to camp and went tubing. It was wicked fun but the water was so cold. Then Makenzie, Paige, Kelsey, and I took the Sea Sprite out on the lake. We were about half way back to camp when we ran out of gas. I was about 2 minutes away from trying to swim to shore and get someone to help when this nice old guy gave us a tow back with his jet ski. I felt so bad because he was burning all his gas just to take us back to camp. Then I ate dinner there and drove Paige home and them came home. Then Gavin called and asked me to go see Spiderman 2 with him. So I got ready real quick and got lectured by my mom on how it was storming and we were going to be struck by lightening. Then Gavin came and we went to the movie. It was pretty good. Then I came home around 12:30 (?) and went right to bed.  Today- I didn't even wake up until 12:30. Then I called Carol and talked to her for a while because she's leaving for Brantingham tomorrow for 2 weeks. I'm going to be so bored for those 2 weeks. And now I'm just online listening to Allister. [Edit: 4:30- I just got my field hockey stuff in the mail. I can't wait for it to start. I'm playing summer league. The first game is the 6th at 5:30 against Sauquiot. Come watch if you want.]  Later I'm not doing anything I think. Tomorrow Emily says we are going up to camp for a 4th of July party because it's supposed to rain on Sunday. So I guess I'll be there all day but I'm not sure yet.  Listening to: [It's Just Me by Allister]  outside I stand sorta cold I used to know how to get warm sometimes you still let me in but I'm not so welcome anymore  why don't you recognize me is it hard to see how much I've changed it's been a while since you despised me but take a look and you'll find out it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me  outside I stand all alone and you come and stand next to me maybe now you'll let me in because I'm not so messed up anymore  why don't you recognize me is it hard to see how much I've changed it's been a while since you despised me but take a look and you'll find out it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me  it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me

      So yesterday Gavin came over and we watched their senior video. (By the way Gavin, you forgot to take the Blink cd with you.) I wish Holland Patent did something like that. I really like hanging out with Gavin. He makes me laugh and smile all the time. I don't know many people that can make me do that. I'm so happy that we are friends and everything worked out for the best.   Today it seems as if life couldn't get much better. I mean I finally seem to have friends that truely care about me and how I feel about things. And people actually want to hang out with me and talk to me on the phone and stuff. It makes me feel a lot better when I realize how much my friends really do care and that they will always be there for me.  Today I had to babysit Paige. Talk about boredom. Well atleast I'm getting some money out of it. Then we went to Ward's for dinner. After that I came home and talked to Carol for a bit and watched some tv. Now I'm online and I'm home alone yet again until about 10 so if anyone wants to come keep me company that would be the greatest.  Tomorrow I'm either babysitting Paige again or I'm going with Carol to take the 5 hour so I can get my licence hopefully by the end of July and then buy a car right after that.  Listening to: [Where To Begin by Bowling For Soup]  Sail away, sail away with me I don't have a ship  But we could get one easily Drift away, drift away with me On the raft we'll make of memories On an ocean we can call forever more   [Pre chorus:] I want to find A piece of your mind I want to see Your make believe I don't want to try so hard I make it hard for you to breathe  [Chorus:] Jump into the ocean Living on a notion If you're caught up in the motion Back track and do it again And if you make it up I could never get enough Me and you together But you've gotta tell me where to begin  Break away, break away from me No forget that, just sit here and look at me Summer's day Summer every day And we watch the sunset come back up And somehow know it never goes back down  [Pre chorus]  [Chorus]  I've been saving up to buy more time with you You've been living it up with someone else And that's okay with me Because I know it and you know it too  [Chorus]

      I am so confused about everything right now. I thought things were going great but I don't even know anymore.  Well yesterday I did absolutely nothing. I talked to Molly and that's about it. And today I'm doing the same thing because my life sucks big time.   So right now I'm just talking to Gavin and that's it. Wow how fun.

      I mean seriously. I throw myself out there for people and what happens? They either don't give a shit or they walk all over me. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of everything. I'm even sick of my friends and people in general. I'm not sick of everyone, there's certain people that I can hang out with and never ever get sick of. I just wish everyone wouldn't take me for granted and think that I'm always going to be there. Well guess what? I'm not. Some day I'm going to be gone and when you need me most I'll be nowhere to be found. Whatever, who really cares anyways right? I mean I don't think any of my friends even read this crap anyways so why does it matter to them? Why do I matter to anyone?  Monday- Went shopping and bought new shorts. I hate going shopping with Emily. She's really fucking embarassing. Sometimes I just hate her so much for what she's done. When I think about it I realize how much my life is going to absolutely suck in about a month. It makes me wish I could just get away somehow or even that I wasn't a part of this fucked up family.  Tuesday- I had to babysit Paige. It was really boring and the pool was really cold. Then I went right from Paige's to field hockey. It was so hot out. I thought I was going to die. I don't remember the score but I think we lost by 1 goal. We should have won though because Beany scored 2 of the goals for the other team because they didn't have enough people.  Today- I'm kind of sore from field hockey yesterday. I have a game today at 5:30 against Whitesboro. And right now I'm just talking to Gavin.  Not listening to anything today because I'm just to lazy to put a cd in the computer.

      So today is another boring day. I think I'm going shopping with my mom to buy new shorts for field hockey some time today. If I'm not doing that then I'm not doing much of anything.  Tomorrow summer league starts! Yay! I can't wait. Come watch us beat Sauquoit on field 1 at the high school at 5:30.  Listening to: [Baby Blue by The Early November]  It's a faster growing green That flows through these leaves I have, I try I guess we'll be alright  Way to try I got a line for you from me, better nice A beautiful baby blue sky that's looking up at you Now watch it fade away  But it's okay to come around With nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better   I know you want it all and you got me Sorry I never was everything you ever dreamed But kept at bay for just in case that day   But it's okay to come around With nights like this are never ending I tried so hard to make this perfect You and I somehow We can't see eye to eye together We always knew that you were better  I don't want you to love me anymore  With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go With my bags packed and ready to go Nothing's ever hurt so much for me than to let you go

      Well, this is the first time since I can remember that I haven't gone to camp for the 4th of July. It's kind of sad when I think about it. It's like breaking a life long tradition. No fireworks, no picnic, no tubing, no sunburns (lol). It's just weird. I guess a lot of things will be changing soon, this is just the start.  Tomorrow I'm starting running for field hockey (I think) and maybe going to get more shorts. Anyone want to go running with me? Tuesday summer league starts. I'm so excited. What was I thinking when I almost didn't sign up for field hockey this year?  Listening to: [Cadillac by Mest]  [VERSE:] It's Friday night What's going on tonight I'll see her later on tonight  But now it's time to roll This somber state is getting old Well I never do what I am told So now we're gonna roll And now we're gonna roll  [CHORUS:] With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac  [VERSE:] We order another round My girl's nowhere to be found I hope she gets here soon before I'm fallin' down  Cause now I'm all torn up I feel like I might throw up Then I get word my girl's showin' up So now I'm gonna roll And now I'm gonna roll  [CHORUS:] With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Rollin' With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Self control knowing right from wrong is what I lack Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac  [BREAK:] Top down seat back wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back wi wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back top down seat back top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac  Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back wi wi wi wi with the  Top down seat back seat back seat back With the top down seat back wi wi wi wi wi with the Top down seat back top down seat back  [CHORUS:] Rollin' With the top down seat back rollin' in my Cadillac Self control knowing right from wrong is what I lack Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac Top down seat back Rollin' in my Cadillac

      Wednesday- Field hockey was cancelled. That's all I remember.  Thursday- Went to field hockey. Lost because we had no goalie. That's all I remember.  Friday- I went to Le Moyne college. I liked it there a lot. The only bad part was the crappy dorm rooms. I'm seriously considering going there. It's far enough away that I can get away from all this bull shit but close enough that I can still hang out with the few good friends I still have on a weekend or something. I don't know yet though. Then I didn't go to field hockey because I was so tired. So instead I went to Barnes and Noble book store and bought some books to read. I'm actually going to read over the summer, that's how bored I've been lately. I need some better people to hang out with. Not just anyone, people that actually understand me and know who I really am and like that same things as me. All of my friends from school seem to care less right now. I don't understand. The end of school was so great, it was the best time I've had in a long time and now I don't talk to any of them. It seems as if the only person I talk to online regularly is Gavin. He seems as if he's the only one that will actually talk to me and listen to my shit (or atleast pretend to care about what I'm talking about). I don't know. All my other friends don't care what I'm going through, it's just all about them and if they are having fun. I just don't get it, is there something I'm missing here?  Saturday- I did nothing all day. I watched the Butterfly Effect. It was a pretty good movie.  Today- I'm at my dad's and I'm bored out of my mind. My life just sucks lately and it's about to get worse.   Why do I write in this anyways? No one cares.

       There's a guy here working on stuff upstairs and I had to get up at 8:30. Grrr I hate it.   Well summer league is over now. We are going to have such a good team this year. I can't wait. We beat Clinton Tuesday night 4-0 (and I scored a goal!). But the other games we lost off of some crap call or stupid mistake. We could have won all of them but oh well. I'm going to keep running because I feel like I'm in okish shape now and I need to keep that up for preseason. So if anyone wants to go running with me that would be the greatest.   Gavin stopped buy last night and I looked like crap. I don't care though because I felt like crap too. Maybe I'm getting sick or something.   I babysat Paige on Tuesday. Paige, my aunt, Makenzie, Kelsey, Emily, my grandma, and I all went to Ward's for lunch. Then we went up to camp. I didn't go tubing or anything because I needed to save my arms for field hockey but I was a spotter. Aubree was there. She is so cute and she says the funniest things.   Today or tomorrow I'm not doing anything at all I think. Boredom...not fun.   And by the way, the comment in a couple posts back that someone posted--you might as well just tell me who you are because I will find out and it will be worse if I have to go through the trouble to find out. So just tell me who it was and I won't be mad (maybe).   Listening to: [You're The Only One by Maria Mena]    Well I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinning around, trying not to look down  But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground  Then you stumbled around for a good ten minutes  And I said I'd never seen anyone look so dumb before  And you laughed and said I still know how to turn you on though   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   And I probably forgot to tell you this  Like that time I forgot to tell you about the scar  Remember how uncomfortable that made you feel?  See you're not what I expected  But you're the only one who knows how to handle me  And you're such a great kisser and I know that you agree   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   I hope you can forgive me for that time  When I put my hand between your legs  And said it was small  Cuz its really not at all  I guess there's just a part of me that likes to bring you down  Just to keep you around  Cuz the day you realize how amazing you are  You're gonna leave me   You're the only one who  Holds my hair back when I'm drunk and get sick  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   You're the only one who  Drags me kicking and screaming through fast dreams  You're the only one who  Knows exactly what I mean   Exactly what I mean   Well I saw you with your hands above your head  Spinning around, trying not to look down  But you did, and you fell, hard on the ground

       Well, it's been a week since my last post so I don't think I'm going to go day by day. I'll just say the things I remember (which isn't much).    &nbsp;  I've been babysitting Paige a lot. I've earned $200 so far this summer. Not bad but it's still not enough for anything I need or want.    &nbsp;  I've been hanging out with friends. I hung out with Carol yesterday and today. I went to a softball game with Joelle on Monday.    &nbsp;  Other than that I've just been hanging out here doing a whole lot of nothing. I've even been reading (amazing huh?). Oh, and I went to the mall one day too. I only went to Target though because I had to buy Paige a birthday present.    &nbsp;  And before I forget, thank you to Gavin for the cd. I'm still waiting for mine back though. And I'm holding yours captive until I get mine back. lol    &nbsp;  So basically, my summer has sucked ass so far.     &nbsp;  Listening to: [The Brilliant Dance by Dashboard Confessional]     So this is odd,    the painful realization that has all gone wrong.    And nobody cares at all,    and nobody cares at all.     &nbsp;  So you buried all your lover's clothes   and burned the letters lover wrote,    but it doesn't make it any better.    Does it make it any better?    And the plaster dented from your fist   in the hall where you had your first kiss    reminds you that the memories will fade.     &nbsp;  So this is strange,    our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance    where nobody leads at all,    where nobody leads at all.     &nbsp;  And the picture frames are facing down    and the ringing from this empty sound    is deafening and keeping you from sleep.    And breathing is a foreign task    and thinking's just too much to ask    and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.    &nbsp;  This is incredible.    Starving, insatiable,    yes, this is love for the first time.    Well you'd like to think that you were invincible.    Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time?    Well this is the last time.

      I hate life and everything about it.  Gavin: If you are wondering why I haven't posted it's because I'm avoiding you (plus the fact that I've been busy). I don't even want to get online anymore because I can't stand talking to you. You hurt me so badly over and over again and I just can't take it anymore. I want to be friends with you, I really do but I just can't do it right now. I'm sorry. I'll come talk to you when I'm ready to talk. Just let me have this healing time that I need and then we can be friends. I don't know how long this will take but, and this is a promise, I'll talk to you as soon as I'm ready to. How could I not be friends with you? You are the one thing that made me happy and made me want to wake up in the morning for a year and a half. Don't ever forget that. I hope you are happy, I really do because that's all I could ever hope for you. Even as unhappy as I am all I want for you is to be happy. And remember, no matter what happens, I'll always love you (as a friend only) and I'll always be there.  You know those people that say they hate everything but you know they don't mean it? Well, I'm not one of them. I truly do hate everything and everyone for screwing me over so badly that it's practically unbearable.  I don't even want to talk about what I've been doing because it's not worth it. I fill my time flirting with random guys that I meet and don't even care anymore. Look at how pathetic I've become.  Sure, I have my fun, but when I look back on it, a second of fun doesn't compare to the hours of hurt, loneliness, anger, and crying I've gone through to get to this place. I look in the mirror and don't even know who I am anymore. I'm not the person I once knew. Looks like it's time for some major soul searching.  It's time for a change, a big change. I can't go on living like this. I deserve to be happy as much as any girl does. (Why can't I believe what I'm typing right now?) Steps to change: Step 1: Have fun at the concert on Sunday with Carol, Kate, Mike, Bill, and Allison and don't think about you-know-who at all. Step 2: Cut hair. And I'm thinking drastic. Maybe even dying it. Step 3: Just have fun and go places. Don't mope around all day feeling sorry for myself. Step 4: Smile on the outside even when I'm crying on the inside. I don't ever want to be conceived as weak ever again. I am stronger than you think I am and I can handle anything anyone throws at me. Step 5: Just continue to love life even if it sucks ass. Step 6: New wardrobe and get license and car by the end of the summer.  I have a feeling that I'm only going to be posting around once a week now, twice at the most. And I'm going to start posting some things I write. That is if I remember.  Countdown to concert: 6 days Countdown to Molly's party:12 days Countdown to Carol and Kim's party: 14 days Countdown to first day of preseason for field hockey: 17 days (?)  And I'd like to thank all of my friends, especially Carol, Kim, and Molly, for helping me realize that life doesn't always have to suck and that I can be happy again. And thank you so much for always being there. I love all of you so much.  The world doesn't stop when I'm depressed. Life goes on and days go by and I shouldn't waste those precious days feeling as bad as I have been lately.  No matter how bad things get, it's not the end of the world. The sun  will  rise tomorrow and everything will eventually be alright again.  Listening to: [Time And Time Again by Chronic Future]  Inspiring, shining, rising And when you're in my way I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure Is me manifested as you in this endeavor Once responsibility is taken I can render Experience to be however I want to remember  Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find  Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go It's all for the character and the aroogant afterglow Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth And what your parents handed down to you to handle Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what wou're trying to find  Well I've seen you and those things you do And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you Your dark defines your light There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to life I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist And there's no way to get back experiences you missed So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
