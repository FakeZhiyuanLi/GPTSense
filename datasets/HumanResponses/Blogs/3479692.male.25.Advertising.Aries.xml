       urlLink Showtime - Movies - Opposite Sex, The: Rene's Story - Main   I'm up late again all excited about this blogging.  Sure I'd heard about blogs some time ago, but it never really interested me - why would I want to publish my thoughts for everyone to see?!  First all of the technical aspects interested me - I can list my blog on other sites, provide a feed, host it on my own server, etc.  Then I was at  urlLink Vera's  with Chris tonight telling him about it and he came up with the idea of creating a community out of it.  Wowzers - that's perfect!  Especially since I named it www.andiamsomebody.com...  Well, maybe I should explain the name.  When I checked myself into  urlLink treatment  at 9:00pm on Feb 13, 2004 (the day before Valentine's day on Friday the 13th of all days!), I went to my first meeting.  It was the  Reflections Meeting .  It's a group-run check-in meeting.  There's a structure to it, some traditions like  Positive Strokes  and  Fuzzy Wuzzy , and then you end with checking in and reciting at least three affirmations.  The affirmations are repeated by the group after you state them, and then you end with, "And I  am  somebody," to which the group responds, "and you  are  somebody.    Anyhow, this was my first group meeting and it still hadn't sunk in that I was in  treatment!   ... and here we were saying silly things like, "and I  am  somebody."  It stuck, and thus the site is born some three and a half months (of sobriety) later.    We'll see if the community evolves, but for now it's just me.    Back to my topic.  I was up watching a Showtime original film -  urlLink  The Opposite of Sex  .  It's a documentary made about a woman who undergoes testosterone therapy and eventually surgery to become a man.  The story itself was good and I'm glad I watched it.  In fact, I was in treatment with a M to F transexual and it was a good experience for me to be exposed to - I didn't realize some of the harsh realities these people have to deal with.    Rene, the subject of the film, constantly worked out - he wanted to become a male stripper when the surgery was complete.  They showed his tryouts and it hapenned to be at Club 7969 - at (wouldn't you know) 7969 Santa Monica Blvd.  It struck a chord with me because when I lived in LA a couple years back I actually helped out at that club with some friends who were throwing a weekly themed gay night.  It was pretty sucessful and I always had fun.  Being that I was 'with the DJ,' I usually got free drinks and always took full advantage of the perk.  Funny enough, I had seen the club on an episode of  urlLink Anna Nicole  about a year ago, too.  Johnny Trendy was MCing a drag queen Anna look-alike contest at the club.    Good gawd did I drink in LA.  I was enamored with the clubs.  It's no wonder that I never got a job the entire six months I was there.  I was too busy partying.  7969 was right next to Crescent Heights, which turned into Laurel Canyon, which took me right over the hill back to my apartment.  I still can't believe how crazy everyone drove through that canyon after the bars closed.  Here's a couple of photos of a little incident a friend of mine and I had with the curb on Crescent Heights:       Funny enough there were no consequences from that night - even though we couldn't get the car jacked up for about an hour and resorted to pulling out a bottle of premixed long island and proceeded to sit down on the blvd to drink it.    Snooze.

       urlLink Biography for Jake Gyllenhaal   Okay, according to the bio page on IMDB.com Jake's last name is in fact pronounced like Jill, not Gill.  Thank you very much.    Anyhow, I've gotton over my resentment for wasting the $8 on  urlLink the film , as I've developed a much deeper appreciation for Mister Gyllenhall.  He's quite the hottie -  urlLink even Dustin Hoffman can't keep his hands off him!      Sweet dreams to me.

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   I am up waaaay too late playing with this whole blogger thing.  I registered a new domain, setup an email account, created a minisite and have had tons of fun playing with the various options Blogger has.  And now, I just found the BLOG THIS function in the Google Toolbar.  I'm going to play with the email posting option next    Trying the file upload function here:     I think that's gonna work!

       urlLink The Day After Tomorrow   I went to the Minnesota Gopher State Roundup this evening - a big AA convention at the Sheritan (formerly Radisson South) at 494 and 100.  It continues again tomorrow and goes through Sunday.  It was okay.  I got there late (phone didn't wake me from my nap) and ended up having to stand at the back of the room to listen to the speaker.  She was pretty cool.  30+ years of sobriety and still cracking jokes that made me laugh.  I particularly liked the one about how acrobatic and flexible she became after her escapades in an old Ford convertible.  She was about 65 - 70 years old and I love dirty old women ;-)  Then we went around to the various hospitality suites where I discovered they were broadcasting the speaker.  Wish I would have known I could have sat down with cookies, diet coke and the company of fellow alchies while laughing - it would have made for a much better time.    Walked around for a while.  Saw some friends I've made from treatment and meetings.  Saw several hotties - which, as it turns out, is becoming quite the added bonus to sobriety.  It's not all just meetings, coffee and cigarettes - there are actually HOT men to be met!  And the straight ones - they're all so sensitive and real.  There's nothing sexier than a hot, sensitive, spiritual, straight man.    Went to a movie afterwards with my sponsor and friend Chris.  It was the WORST movie I've seen in a long time.  The height of my night was really Gopher State, but notice I'm still resentful that I spent ten bucks on this piece of shit movie.  It's called  The Day After Tomorrow  with hottie  Jake Gyllenhaal .  I hope for my sake that his career isn't over as he's quite the cutie and I'd like to continue seeing him on the big screen.  The movie was a lot like  Deep Impact  from 1998 with  Elijah Wood .  End of the world with a love story and other sub-dramas going on.  Oh, and I forgot - the producers spent all of their money on just-okay special effects and everything else in the film sucked.    Anyhow, I'm letting go and letting God.  There are more important things to spend my time on than getting worked up over how terrible it was, and besides, I am somebody.

      I've fallen through that threshold I thought I'd never cross - I've created a blog.  Good gawd.  It's really my sponsor's fault.  He told me I should begin journaling.  He told me I should get a pretty red-velvet covered journal and begin writing.    But no.  I had to do it my way.  I told him I'd rather type than write.  So here I am.  Hope you're all happy.

      LOL - check it out,  urlLink Rush Limbaugh  said, "I am somebody."  Granted, I don't care for him much.  Granted, his comment was made in a sarcastic, negative manner.  Granted, he's a totally sick alcoholic and that needs to be taken in consideration.  I just thought it was funny.

      My sponsor told me something very valuable once - if you find that someone is getting on your nerves, it's usually not their problem, as they're happy doing whatever it is doing whatever's bothering you.  It's usually something that's wrong with yourself if someone else is getting on your nerves.  Does that make sense?  He also gave me some good advice on dealing with people who may tend to 'get on your nerves' if that person happens to be a friend.  You've go a couple of options:  a) you learn to deal with it  b) you let the person know your feelings and they may or may not modify their behavoir  c) you stop associating with the person  I love thinking about things this way.  Makes things very simple.  Obviously option C is for extreme cases.  Option B is pretty easy if you're open about things.  And option A, although maybe not the most desireable or easiest option, seems to be coming easier and easier for me lately - I hope it keeps progressing.  Anyhow, time to call people and tell them to get their asses in here.

      Phew.  I'm glad the weekend is over!  This was my first sober  urlLink Pride .  Well, my first full sober pride - I was once sober and backstage at the  urlLink Long Beach  pride while  urlLink The Village People  and  urlLink Amber  performed, but that doesn't really count.    Back to present day - It's funny how many other sober people were there... I honestly thought pride was one big drink-fest before.  At least that's how I always remembered it.  There was plenty-o-eye-candy about!  I had wanted to take my camera, but I lost the flash memory card, so I have no pictures of any of them :-(  I especially enjoyed the sign language interpretive dance the Leather-Daddy-sign-language-interpretor was performing stage left at the smaller stage on the south end of the park.  Aside from aforementioned leather daddy, there were plenty of other "diverse" people about.  Working the booth, I somewhat felt like the folks in  urlLink Carnivàle , except there was one small difference - the 'weirdos' were on the other side of the booth!    The tea booth itself was a taxing experience - lots of manual labor hauling that shit around and we sold much less than we had anticipated, so we carried around that much more.  But I'm not bitter, or sore.  LOL - it's good that I can make myself laugh, right?  It was also fun to watch Richard, a hunky straight guy in the program who worked the booth with me, get hit on left and right.  Some folks went so far as to ask him for sex.  Always jokingly of course, but there's always some truth in those comments :-)  I'm sure these comments had a LOT of truth in them.    I heard on the news that the Twin Cities pride event is the 3rd largest in the nation.  I'm sure New York is the largest, but who's second?  Chicago's has got to be big.  Los Angels as well, but then again, in LA, they have a ton of Pride's... that city is so spread out they almost have to.  I would guess San Francisco would be large, as well as San Diego.  If anyone knows, I'm curious.  I met  urlLink Jim  from blog land, as well as  urlLink Aaron  - though I'm just guessing on Aaron because he didn't specifically state that's who he was, but I'm assuming :-)  Of course,  urlLink Jim  was there and I also ran into   urlLink Wanda , too.  Oh, I also ran into a couple of people who were having too much fun (read: DRUNK) who have spotted me around Gaviidae or outside the building smoking.  It's funny how many people recognize me from the street corner of Nicollet and 6th and say, "haven't I seen you outside smoking?" and then I respond, 'probably' and they have no other conversation to make.    But it's Monday and I'm back at work now.  Have a spectacular day!

      I'm moving my site over to another host so I can rid myself of an unnecessary bill - don't ask me why I signed up for a second host.  Okay, it was to try out this nifty webstats package that didn't end up being so nifty afterall.  Anyhow, you may see an older version of the site for a short period of time.  Don't worry - nothing's been lost and the world isn't going to end :-)  Everything will be back to normal within about 24-48 hours.

      It's  urlLink Farmers' Market  day on Nicollet Mall!  MMM, good, cherry turnovers right outside of Gaviidae!    It's too bad the two hunky farmer boys no longer work outside of the IDS tower.  At least I haven't seen them this year.  It's funny, though - anyone you ask, "have you seen those two boys outside of the IDS tower" and they start jumping, "YES, YES!"  I used to take strolls down Nicollet several times a day every Thursday afternoon just to catch a glimpse of these guys.  Sometimes I'd buy a single banana or cucumber.  Please come back, boys.

      Good gawd things are busy these days.  Work is nuts.  I like being busy, though :-)  Provides stability.  Just wish there were more hours in the day to provide time to relax.    I hope to work on some updates to the site here soon, but it's probably going to be a while until I get a chance as I'm going to be working all weekend at Pride selling tea and I have to get to the gym so I can look good while doing it!  ... in the meantime, go check out my new Blogger friend's site at  urlLink www.wandawisdom.com  - make sure to check out the videos and tell her Sparkles sent yah.  "And she looked ... just ... like ... THIS!"  (points for anyone who can tell me what movie I took that from)  Here's Wanda on the left:

      ... don't have to be crazy, I don't have to be crazy, I don't have...  I met with a couple of friends for coffee tonight.  One was having a hard time with some roommates and an arrangement he had with them.  He was so worked up over it - very agitated and couldn't stop dwelling on it.  His roommate was clearly in the wrong, but his roommate's craziness was making HIM crazy - it was like craziness via osmosis!    Thank gawd I was with two more-senior-sober-than-I-people who had some great advice.  One of them said a very wise thing - "You don't have to be crazy, too."  I thought that was super-fantastic.  You know when you can recognize when somebody else is crazy.  Deal with it and move on - don't let it suck you in.

      This weekend was fantastic!  Though it was nice and sunny, it never rose much above 70, so I didn't get an opportunity to work on my tan, but I'm not going to bitch too much because the rain we've had is so dreadfully depressing - the sun is a nice change.    I've watched  Girls Will Be Girls  a few times in the last week.  It's pure all-out camp.  Miss CoCo Peru stars as one of three main gals.  You'd recognize her from  Trick  and  To Wong Foo Foo .  "Have you ever had cum in your eye, Gabriel?  It  burrrrrns !"  Go rent it, or better yet, go buy it:                                    And, along the same lines,  Die Mommie Die  just came out on video, too!  It's a real tribute to the old Betty Davis flicks, and it stars Jason Priestly post-i'm-an-idiot-car-crash-incident!

      I added a few people to my site template under the 'friends' list on your right.    Thanks to Andy at  urlLink eleventh avenue south  who put together a list of queer bloggers in the Minneapolis area and listed me!     urlLink Dunner  invited me to get a gmail account seems super cool, but since  urlLink friendster  is so flaky we can't seem to be friends yet :-(    And of course  urlLink Jimbo , the first person to email me after I put up my blog.  He's a bundle of energy and super nice.    Anyway, I'm going to finish up transfering my blog to a different server (I'm consolidating down to one!) and head to  urlLink Wilde Roast  while the transfer finishes up.  Todd (see below) makes the best deserts in town!    (and yes, I'm having way too much fun with links and photos in this post!)

      So I made some of my own  urlLink drama  last night.    Had a great dinner with my parents and brother.  Though my Dad and brother both had a couple of beers, which I thought was strange.  I guess I only thought it was strange because I thought they would try to be considerate and not drink around me.  I probably would have thought it was weird had they not drank, because I don't want people to treat me any differently just because I'm no longer drinking... oh well.  I don't care that they did.  My mom is super-nervous all the time.  Being with her in public, or even at home, is a little nervewracking because she's got such high anxiety.  Surprisingly she was pretty well behaved at dinner - no nervous outbreaks, so I thought things went well.  Then an hour later she calls up and leaves me this voicemail, near tears, that she's sorry for what she said tonight and that she didn't intend for it to 'come out that way.'  I had  no idea  what she was referring to.  So I called her back.  It was really nothing - just something we had joked about during dinner, that she thought I had taken offense to - which I hadn't.  We worked it all out and things are fine now, but it's stuff like this that really makes me sad for my mom.  She can't behave normally.  She's always worked up about something, or anxious, or nervous, or depressed, or crying.  She's never happy, which is so sad.    It's too bad I can't do more than try to be there for her, except that being there for her drives me crazy sometimes.  She's another one who naturally creates  urlLink drama  but I don't think she ever realizes it... she is so deep in her  urlLink drama  that she doesn't seem to know where reality is anymore.  Anyhow, back to work.

      Gosh, I feel sorta like Doogie Howser writing every night before I go to bed.  Hah.  Except I'm not a 14 year old doctor ;-)  My sunburned ass was drug to Homo Depot tonight to pick out flowers for a friend's patio.  It was actually sorta fun, and I saw a ton of  urlLink Scotts  and  urlLink Miracle-Gro  products, which is cool, since I work on their websites and rarely see the actual product.  We picked up some plants and then went off to a meeting in St. Paul.    It was a really cool meeting.  Huge barbecue in the backyard of a sober house near the  urlLink Fellowship Club .  Lots of newbies there like myself, but they were all very cool.  A buddy I've met in the program, Jay, was the evening's leader.  It was his duty to run the meeting and then present the topic.  It was then an open forum for whoever wanted to speak on the topic.    Jay picked  surrender  as a topic - which I thought was a great topic, though I've heard it picked as a topic two other times, it's always a good subject.  In fact, the first time I saw  urlLink Jim , he was the topic presenter at the Friday night  urlLink Pride  meeting.  He also picked  surrender  as a topic.  Anyhow, surrender for me has meant a lot of things.  The first time I surrendered was when I admitted that I needed to go to treatment, that things weren't going the way they should be, that I couldn't do it alone.    I've surrendered in other ways since, and continue to surrender every day.  Many people said a lot of good things tonight.  Some of the things I got out of the meeting...   - Surrender means giving up control.  Since I can't control my alcoholism I have to give into it.  If I admit to my powerlessness over booze, I gain the power to live my life.  As people were speaking on this topic, I found myself wondering if people who 'go back out' think that they can control their addiction now.  Have they given up surrendering?  I guess that's what it means to me.  - Surrender means action.  This is one I'm still working on, and will probably continue to work on forever.  To me it means to do what people tell me to do.  Not fighting to be in control.  To go with the flow and take action.   urlLink Jim  told me that I have to call at least three people in the program each day.  I've struggled with this, but am happy to report that I called five today!  Yeah, me!  I wonder if that means I only have to call one tomorrow?  - Surrender means living God/Higher Power's will, not your own.  And this one I  know  I'll be working on until the day I die, though it's probably the most important aspect of surrender.  One man spoke about the purpose of the program all boiled down to serving God and others.  He said to check out page 77 in the Big Book.    Hmph, I just checked out page 77 and I fear that I don't understand it.  It seems to be talking about Step 9 work, making amends with those we've hurt in the past.  It says not to present ourselves as doing spiritual work, so as not to be labeled as fanatics.  I don't get it.  Anyhow, I do see the value in service work - I truly believe that it is probably necessary to stay sober.  I guess I had better get busy.  Anyhow, I'm going to go suffer through another night of semi-sleep with a sunburned back ;-)

      I keep having these drinking dreams on the weekends when I get to sleep in!  I've never usually remembered much of my dreams, but I know that I get the feeling that I've been drinking.  On occasion I will remember exactly what I was drinking - usually a vodka tonic - but usually I just get the feeling I was whoop'n it up.    Sometimes I'll wake up from these dreams with the instantaneous feeling that I've been drinking and I feel like, 'oh shit!' and then the realization will come to me that I was just dreaming.    ... and then I'll actually sometimes wake up with what I like to call a faux-hangover.  It's a terrible feeling!  I'll get a headache, have a foggy mind, and generally just be slow-going for a while.    I guess this is just my alcoholic mind at work.  It's either craving a cocktail (see below) or having flashbacks.  Whichever the case, I wish it would get over it!     Anyway, it's supposed to be around 80 and sunny all weekend!  I'm going to go up to the pool and lay out :-)

      Today is my fourth month anniversary in sobriety.  Well, actually, since it's past midnight, I've got four months and one day.  I also did my second step tonight with  urlLink Jim .  I was actually kind of nervous going into it because I don't really know where I lie spiritually right now.  What I do know is that I've come to really enjoy AA, I've met some really cool people in it, and my life has gotten a whole lot better since joining.  If all I have to do is believe that a higher power can restore myself to sanity, then I guess I'm going to believe it!  Jim told me that this step is something that, if you're struggling with it, you should at least try to "fake it 'til you make it," meaning that you should do what's suggested and eventually you'll get it.    I don't think that I'm  completely  struggling with it, more like I just don't know how God is going to restore me to sanity.  I guess I'll just have to have faith.  Anyhow, we talked, I identified a lot with what he said.  As a result of examining this step and continuing to work on it, I'm going to pray more often, pray in a more structured fashion, have faith, and continue to try and 'let go and let God.'    "Let go and let God" was something I picked up on almost immediately while in treatment.  I've always been a control freak - major character defect for me, and when something happens that I don't like, it's so nice to be able to say this little prayer to myself.  It's a major relief.  You surrender to the reality that you can't do anything about, have a mini-epiphany, if you will, and just let it go.  It's almost empowering in a non-empowering sort of way.    The other thing I'm going to work on is what I like to call my "karma bank."  I feel like I've been incredibly blessed in my life.  I've been fortunate, raised in a loving household, have a lot to be thankful for, have never really had to face any  huge  consequences, and I feel sometimes like I don't deserve it.  Like maybe someday something really catastrophic might happen to me because I've taken out this huge karma-loan and one day I might have to pay back on it.  Jim told me that I had better start doing some service work so that I can pay it back little-by-little - I think that's a great idea :-)    Anyway, off to never-never land - actually I'm just reading  urlLink A Million Little Pieces  by James Frey - a memoir about a 23 year old who ends up at Halzeden with no teeth, a swoolen face, and literally nothing else.

      After seeing this film:   urlLink Latter Days   ... I found myself seeing more and more Mormon boys out riding their bikes through the neighborhood.  I had never noticed them before!  Makes me wonder if they'd always been there, or if the Mormon church thought they'd take advantage of the free publicity ;-)  Just kidding - they probably didn't appreciate the film too much.  Anyway, the point of my post - I saw the hottest two Mormon boys the other day.  In fact, I don't recall ever seeing an un-hot one.    Along the 'never noticed them before' lines.  I find it funny that I had NO idea that coffee shops were filled with people in the program prior to treatment.  I used to hang out in them just to socialize, read a book, or get a coffee.  Now it's practically a staple in my life.  I don't go more than 48 hours without visiting a coffee shop.

      Godamn  urlLink The Stepford Wives  was funny!  Definately a must-see.    There was actually some valid stuff in the film, though, not just all comedy, camp and brainwashed housewives.  There's a point where Nicole Kidman's characater, Joanna, realizes that everyone in Stepford is happy.  They do their work, they smile, they're polite and they do tons of service work!  Joanna decides that she's going to try it, and for a while at least, she's happy, though she ends up with an overstock of muffins.  I too sometims try to force myself to have fun.  Sometimes it makes other people around me have fun, and in turn, I end up having genuine fun myself.  I'm going to be fun today!

      I went to a meeting tonight - Saturday Night Live at the Basilica.  It's a great meeting - lots of people, lots of energy.  The speaker tonight was Heidi.  I thought she was really good.  I didn't really want to go to a meeting, but I made myself - and as is usually the case, it turned out great.    She said a couple of things that really struck me.  The first being, "I drink, therefore I am."  It really boils it all down to the alcoholic mindset.  When you compare the statement to the original quote - 'I think, therefore I am,' it really makes sense.  Drinking literally becomes your obsession, holding your thoughts, your being, your self, captive.  It rules everything you do - it defines you.  The statement really put things into perspective for me.  The second thing she talked about was an analogy she had once heard.  She said that drinking is like stepping onto the train tracks.  The engine comes first, the caboose last.  The engine is what kills you - not the caboose.  The concept makes complete sense.  Once you have that first drink, you cannot stop, and the more you drink, the sicker you become ... but it's the first drink that gets you, not the last.

He's set a great example for me as to how to live your life without the booze and dope that Broadway doesn't go for.  He's introduced me to the Legion of Decency - a sisterhood of saints who live their lives preaching to those with less than ideal morals.  And of course he's been a great person to know for his vast network of sober friends, and seemingly endless list of cute boys.  Other hoorays should go to Johnny H, Dave D, a host of other friends, and of course, my sponsor,  urlLink Sister Geckler , whose guidance, exemplary lifestyle, perfect manners, and gorgeous good-looks I couldn't have survived to this day without.

      I've had a stiff neck and back ever since I had to lift up my roommates monstrosity of a bed to get our laundry out.  He had jam-packed a laundry basket underneath in a hurry.  I couldn't get my underwear out, so I had to lift the bed up while he pulled out the basket.  Tricky manuever, but at least I had clean underwear.  Down side was that I've been sufferring with a stiffie for the past week.  I finally made an appointment with a chiropractor.  Good news is that he lives right down the block from me AND he could get me in today!  Otherwise, hope to catch some rays up at the pool today, and then go to the meeting at the Fellowship club in St. Paul at 7:00.

      Today started out busy.  Busy is good when you don't want to think, and I didn't care for thinking today.    I spoke with my mom for about 45 minutes.  She's continuing to dramatize.  It's almost like she watched too many episodes of Rescue 911 with William Shatner, where every segment contains a 'dramatization' disclaimer, only she chose to ignore that and thought they were filming events in real life.  Funny coincidence - she used to work with a guy who was featured on Rescue 911 - he was a cop who, while in pursuit of an assailant, was shot in the family jewels... uh, I mean jewel.  Anyhow, I continued with the 'uh-huh's' and listened.    For a short while today I was agonizing over the thought of speaking with her.  She's been very dependant on me lately - much more so than usual, and when I try to end the phone conversations, she suddenly says, "why?"  ... like I should have hours to spend on the phone all day.  Really, I think she's just paranoid, deluding that I don't want to talk to her.  But I digress.  I was not looking forward talking to her today as I was afraid she would still be losing it.  And when she loses it, I tend to lose it.  Luckily, she seemed to be somewhat normal (i.e., not crying) so things went okay.  I called my sponsor and we went for a walk around Lake Calhoun today.  We had about 3 weeks of rain and today was the first sunny day.  TONS of eye candy, and I don't mind candy.    The day ended up alright, and I'm still here :-)

      ... I am going to be an uncle.  I've got 2 older half brothers, 2 older half sisters and 1 younger (full) brother.  All older siblings are married and have children - 6 nieces and nephews total.  I just found out this evening from my mentally ill mother that my younger brother got his ex-girlfriend pregnant.    It's the same story with every girlfriend he has.  My mother becomes embedded in the relationship and will speak praise on high of the girlfriend, always commenting that she, "hopes he holds onto this one."  As soon as they break up she changes her attitude to, "well she wasn't quite perfect and she wasn't helping to promote a healthy lifestyle by doing all of his cleaning and laundry for him."  Well, this last one, who was 'studying to be an orthodontist,' and who my mother was desperately trying to convince my brother to marry (presumably for some financial stability) has planted a firm grip on my brother's life, and my mother's, and my family's.    Apparently they broke up.  Then the girlfriend informed my brother that she was pregnant with his child.  My brother wanted her to have an abortion.  She wouldn't hear of it.  A few days later my brother had some friends over to watch a movie, when she walked in.  She saw another girl in attendance and proceeded to the kitchen, where she found the largest knife available.  She returned to the living room and attempted to attack the other girl.  My brother wrestled the knife away from her.  She returned to the kitchen, found another knife, and locked herself in the bathroom, threatening suicide.  My brother had to kick the door in to keep her from hurting herself.  Talk about a cry for attention.  No wonder my mother identified with her so well.  Anyhow, she spent three days in the psych ward and my brother is now planning to sue for full custody once the child is born.  Funny enough, the ex-girlfriend called my mother to talk.  My mother has continued conversations with this girl under the premise that she is 'taking notes.'    What a frick'n mess.  I'm trying not to be dramatic about this; I'm trying not to let it affect my well-being.  But it's got me down.  It's more drama, more turbulence, more unhappiness, and more for my mother to feel victimized about.    Oh well - just another day in sobriety.

      I am loved.  I am living in the here and now.  I'm living God's will.  ... and I am somebody.      Cheesy, huh? I said that twice a day when I was in treatment. It meant something to me at the time, but I haven't really used the affirmations since, and it's been about five months since I left treatment.     I'm frankly shocked by the outpouring of support I've recieved by people I have only just met online, just met in  the program  (AA, for you normies), and people I've known for a while. I got an email from a friend last night just checking in with me. It's that kind of shit that makes you keep living. That somebody would take even 20 seconds to send a quick email and let you know they're thinking about people. I thank God every day for putting those people in my life.    To be honest, I'm not all that down about anything. At least not yet. I think I'm surviving by the grace of God and the support I've been receiving. That, and, I've kept myself really busy and haven't allowed any depression to set in yet.     I didn't respond to my last thread because there were just too many responses to make. But, I do want to say, thank you, all. You're all blessings.

      Well, it happened.  I was the  last  person they called in. I'm guessing there were abour 40 of us all-together. My manilla envelope contained a breakdown of what I was being payed off for (vacation, severence, pay-to-date, etc.), information on COBRA benefits, and a copy of the confidentiality agreement I signed when I first began two and a half years ago. I packed a box of my personal items and walked out. People said goodbye. Hugs. I'm sorrys. Lets do lunch's. Etc.      The last time I was laid off, it was Valentine's Day. I went to  urlLink Zelo  with my fellow newly unemployed coworkers. By this time, I was downing about my ninth Long Island.   This time I called friends.   urlLink Jim  picked me up. The HR manager called shortly after I left to notify me that they'd neglected to mention I had a loan against my 401k (to buy my condo) that had to be paid back in full within 30 days.  I quickly deposited my last check (in case they tried to adjust it for the 401k loan). Went to a meeting, then dinner at  urlLink The Monte Carlo , and desert at  urlLink The Wilde Roast .      I feel much better about the whole situation. It's not as devastating to me as it was the last time I was laid off. I have faith this time. I have real friends this time. I'm grateful for these things.

      Well, we lost the big account that accounted for 20% of our income at work.  The HR folk are busy hussling people into closed-door conference rooms and giving them their severence checks.  Most of the office doesn't know it's going on.  They won't tell us what hapenned until later in the day.  I'm expecting an email from the President announcing "lets get together this afternoon at the keg."  It's sad.  Some people have been here for so long, some have put a majority of their life into this place.  I hope I'm still here by the end of the day.  I guess what happens just is.

What  was  unusual about this man was that he was walking his CAT!  He had one of those harness leasches hooked up to his big furball of a cat as it snopped its nose around a tree.    Am I ignorant - is this a normal occurance?

      Okay, so I was all excited about  urlLink IKEA  opening and then I didn't even post anything about my trip... or maybe I mentioned it, but I think it deserves it's own post.   We're here!!!     urlLink       They had an  entire  parking lot set aside just for the media. It was the closest lot and it was HUGE. Of course they had customers parking across the street and walking a mile in the sweltering heat, but everyone knows that marketing should come first!   urlLink       Here's one of the TV station trucks with their broadcasting satellite fully extended.  You'd think that they'd want to park  farther  away from the building since it's so big it probably interferes with the signal! Ok, I'm done bitching about how far I had to walk - I promise. That's  urlLink Jim  in the lower left checking out one of the dozens of uber-hotties parading around the lot.   urlLink       In the main entrance area they had a Mini Cooper on display with all of these boxes stacked on top of it. The stack was so tall I couldn't fit the entire thing in the frame of my camera. On the very top (not pictured) there was a red sofa to match the car and the other various items. It must have been a nightmare to get this thing setup properly - notice it's leaning against the wall in some places.   urlLink       This is  urlLink Jim  and a complete stranger. They're posing for what we hope will become part of the next catalogue. They must have failed to realize that none of the staged shots in the IKEA catalogue feature PEOPLE.    urlLink       I LOVED the cafateria!  I paid only $3.75 for a serving of Swedish meatballs, potatoes, the chocolate desert, and a medium-sized soda!  It was surprisingly good, too - especially considering it was served cafateria style!  This is a such a good idea, too, considering how much walking you do in this place, and how much time you can spend there.  You're bound to work up an appetite half-way through your shopping experience.   urlLink       On this trip I didn't actually purchase anything.  On the next trip (yes, I've been there twice in the past two weeks), I purchased an umbrella for $4.  I've heard they sell them for a dollar off on days that it's raining.  I'm waiting on any major purchases until I find out what the roommate is doing.  Hopefully I won't have to buy anything.    There are more photos of my trip in the  urlLink gallery .

      It was so nice to wake up this morning without the sweltering humidity!  I got up early and headed down to Spyhouse, where I got my regular coffee and blueberry muffin.  Did the crosswords and came in to work.      Sort of feeling blah today.  Roommate is still undecided about moving, and as such, feels the need to continue talking about the pros and cons with me.  He's meeting with his would-be new boss (if he takes the job in NYC) on Monday night for dinner.  That meeting is supposed to be the determining factor in his decision.  Unfortunately directly afterwards, on Monday, another employer is flying him out of town for a week to open a new store.  I  really  hope he decides before he takes off.  At this point, I just want to know either way.    Happy Thursday to you all.

      It's so humid out today, as it was yesterday.  You walk outside and you feel like you're walking through a thick stew.  As Paul Majors said on the news last night, your body loses it's ability to cool down by sweating because the air is so humid your sweat won't evaporate.  Yuck.    Do you ever get yourself so psyched up over something and then it doesn't happen?  Like counting your chickens before they've hatched?  I find myself doing it all too often.  I start thinking about after the chickens hatch I can have them start laying eggs, and I can kill one for lunches for the next week, and on and on and on... I get myself all excited, and then let down.  I guess I still have to work on my second and third step - living by God's will, not my own.    My roommate was talking about moving to New York again last night.  It sounds like he really wants to do it, and is probably leaning towards going.  He has to let his job know by Monday.  The suspense is sorta bothering me, but at the same time, I'm trying to "let go and let God."  If he moves, life  does  go on.  It's sad, though.  We've both become very codependant on each other.  I love the guy to death, and vice versa.  I feel like lately the conversations have been leaning towards him wanting me to tell him to go... which I have, just not in so many words.  What I've told him is that he can't factor me into his decision - he has to do this or not do it for himself, not me.  Of course I want him to stay, but I know myself that taking this job in NY would be a great opportunity for him, and probably the right thing to do.  I just know that if he does do it, he won't be back and we'll never be as close as we are now.  Am I being selfish?

      Okay, so I've been trying to live by a higher power's timeline - his/it's will, not my own. To those non-AAers, it's basically equivalent to the thought behind the saying, "Live and let live." (my own interpretation)   In AA we talk about willingness and action. The willingness to let God determine what's best for us, to recognize it, etc. Then the action - to act on God's will (not your own). The trouble for me comes in when God puts opportunities or options in front of you. We often talk about "doing the next right thing." This concept is simple when it comes to things like, "should I spend time with my family, or should I blow them off and go to the bar." The problem for me comes in when the options rise in complexity.   For instance, how do you tell the difference between an opportunity that God may have put in front of you to recognize and act on, and when you're trying to spur something into action because of your own will? If I want to start my own business, is that something that I should hold off on? That takes self-initiation. God's not going to put a sign in front of me that says "start your own business." Or is he?

      The FMA didn't pass in the senate - woohoo!!!  I'm so happy I could just dance!       That  focker   urlLink Coleman  voted for it.  HRC just sent me the following email:  Dear Dan,  We did it! Just moments ago, the Federal Marriage Amendment lost in the Senate by a stunning, bipartisan vote of 50-48. We won this historic victory for two reasons: First, because the politics of division don't work, and second: the votes were on our side.  But the real reason we won is this: You. You and every fair-minded American, gay or straight, who called, e-mailed, faxed, visited, tracked down, and otherwise urged your Senators not to write discrimination into the Constitution. Thank you. This amazing moment belongs to all of us. Please, share this victory with all the friends and family you talked into fighting with us. We join in celebration with each of you. The campaign to defeat this amendment has been a top priority for HRC and with your amazing efforts over the course of many months, today we won this round of the fight.  Thank you - again.   What's next: I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't remind you that it's not over. Our ultra-conservative opponents are determined to spread their discriminatory agenda across the country. Fasten your seatbelts, my friends, because the months ahead are going to be challenging indeed:  Next week, the House will take up the issue of marriage equality as well. Expect a fight. Expect vicious words and fierce debate. And expect to speak up, loud and clear, once more.  During the next three months, no fewer than 11 states - and possibly 13 - are facing ballot initiatives to write discrimination into their state constitutions. HRC will fight these initiatives shoulder to shoulder with state and local GLBT leaders. We'll let you know how you can help.   And of course - like you, we will be actively working to stop discrimination at the source by electing equality-minded legislators around the country. We're glad to know you will be with us in that battle, too.   All of this work starts tomorrow. For today, I will take a moment to appreciate this hard-won victory. I hope you'll join me.   Many, many thanks for all you have done.  Cheryl A. Jacques Human Rights Campaign President  P.S. For all the details about this important vote, please visit our web site:  http://www.hrc.org   To  urlLink see how your Senators voted , please  urlLink click here  to visit the Senate website - the vote was Roll Call Vote 155.

       urlLink This article  in the Strib this morning is interesting.  I admit, I haven't had time to read it yet, but I'm excited to.  It's funny how things like this don't get any press until they actually happen - I suppose because a judge can't be influenced or bought (at least one would hope not!).

      Strange day so far.  Work is busy, but a few things have struck me:  Was driving into work today and spotted an older, heavier gentleman in the large Lincoln next to me at the stoplight.  He was wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses, light-colored suit, and  white gloves made of lace !    Drove further down Hennepin and was at a stoplight next to a dumptruck.  The phone number on the side of the truck read:  763.422.DUMP  Made me laugh.   urlLink IKEA  opens in 18 hours!  I was debating when I'd actually go to the store, not wanting to get stuck in the rush of suburbanites sure to flock there.  Then I realized that if I pass up Wednesday, the weekend will probably be just as bad.  Then I realized that IKEA is  always  busy... so I think I'm just going to brave the crowd and go on Wednesday after work.  It's a beautiful 80 degrees in Minneapolis right now - no humidity and plenty of sunshine!  LOVE it!  Good weather makes me so happy :-)  Oh, and lastly - there's been this truck driving around downtown for the past few days.  It looks like an oversized delivery truck, but not a semi.  On the side of the truck it's got a large billboard-sized ad about the Pro-Life stance on abortion.  The first time I saw it I just rolled my eyes, but then it kept coming around!  I've since heard rumors that it's just an empty truck, used as an advertising medium, and that there are people on the streets talking to people about their cause as well.  Yesch.  Somebody should put a spike-strip out like they do on  urlLink America's Wildest Police Chases .

      I just got this email from MoveOn.org.  For those of you in Minnesota, this is directly applicable to you.  For those of you outside of MN, I urge you to call your legistlators.   Thank you for supporting the "United, Not Divided" campaign. There's not much time left. The Senate is expected to vote on the Constitutional amendment on Wednesday, July 14th. The most important thing you can do right now is call your senators.  We've got to let them know that America is not falling for this cynical attempt to divide us. To make it easy, we've included their direct phone numbers below.   Please call your Senators now, at:   Senator Mark Dayton Direct: (202) 224-3244   Senator Norm Coleman Direct: (202) 224-5641   Urge them to:      "Protect marriage equality for everyone --    Vote NO on the Federal Marriage Amendment."

      Went to an  urlLink NA  meeting tonight.  This meeting has an open discussion during the latter half and I was thinking about what I might say on my way over there.  It occurred to me that it's been a pretty busy week, and I'm surprised I'm handling it as well as I am.  My mother was admitted to the hospital, my roommate might be leaving for new york.... hell, what am I bitching about.  It could be soooo much worse.  I'm handling everything well because there's not that much to handle.  Yesch, I can be such a pitty-party.  Life is grand.    I had an action-packed day today!  Got up early at 6:30, drove a friend to work, went for coffee at SpyHouse, did my crosswords, visited with a good friend and his toddler son, went to lunch at the  urlLink Wilde Roast , laid out for a couple of hours and went for a swim up at the pool, visited my mother in the hospital, went to  urlLink the gym , went to  urlLink dinner , went to the meeting, and then finished up watching   Die Mommie Die   at a friend's place.  Getting ready for bed now :-)  I finished  my book  - anyone have any suggestions for my next read?  Lately I've been reading memoirs/autobiographies and books on recovery.  Sorta want to check out what this whole  Tao  thing is about, too.

      I had a really long day yesterday.  Work included an all-day meeting with a new vendor we're working with.  I ducked out when I could to actually work, but still ended up leaving the office with a to-do list a mile long.  My mother called me on my way home.  She wasn't doing well and thought she might need to be hospitalized for mental illness.  I told her to call the hospital and I'd call her after my AA meeting.    By the time I got out of the meeting she had called twice.  I went to the house.  She was sitting on the bed crying.  It's a terrible thing to see your mother cry - really touches you in a place that nothing else really can.  I remember the first time I had seen my mother cry - I was about 12 years old and had never witnessed it before.  I didn't know how to react.  My mom and dad had made the decision to put their dog of 17 years to sleep.  She didn't cry again until many years later when she had her nervous breakdown, which was, I think about 5 years ago now.  Lately the crying has become a little more commonplace, but it still gets you right there.    We went to the hospital, checked her in through the ER, which, BTW, included no  urlLink Noah Wyle  look-alikes.  I waited around for about 30 minutes and she was taken upstairs.  I left.  Went to  urlLink Jim's  house and hung out with him and Frank for a short while.  It's nice to know I've got friends I can count on now.    When I got home my roommate was in a stressed out mood.  He'd just gotten back from a week in New York and I hadn't really had a chance to talk to him since his return.  Small talk ensued; I told him about the situation with my mother, and then BAM - he tells me his company is offering him a promotion, double the salary, all moving expenses and a huge bonus to move out to new york.    I'm very happy for him, but I LOVE this guy to death.  We're best friends.  Just this last week while he was traveling I became depressed.  I've depended on him in the past and vice versa.  I would miss him A LOT.  If he moved, I'd also have to find a new roommate (or two).  At the same time, this is an incredible opportunity for him.  He said he hasn't made any decisions yet, but I'm worried.   Anyhow, things  could  be worse.  In fact, they have been.  Six months ago I would have been at the bar last night and would still be in bed as I write this.  I most likely would have lost my job by now.  Wouldn't have the friends that I do.  So, for that, I am grateful to be here :-)

      Okay, so I did get something good out of  A Million Little Pieces , afterall.  The last 50 or so pages are actually getting good.  James Frey speaks about how we (we being alcoholics and addicts) are all born normal [perhaps genetically predispositioned to addiction, but I don't know...] people.  Then the  disease  strikes, and it's not picky.    I was thinking about this in reference to when I see all of the homeless people under the bridges at the Lyndale/Hennepin/I-94 junction, and the various randoms that come by my office building and pick through the ash trays looking for unused cigarettes.  I've never really thought about those people, other than to feel sorry for them, annoyed with them, avoiding them, etc.  I get really bothered when they ask for money, because I feel like, no, I've earned this dollar, why should I give it to you?  But after I read this, I thought, wow, maybe those hobos were once  normal .  Now I feel really bad for them.  It's still hard to give them any money, because I can guess where it's going to be spent.    Anyhow, I'm at work now, and I'm grateful to be here.

      Sorta in a strange mood tonight.  It's Monday night and I have to return to work tomorrow after a three day weekend :-(  The weekend was pretty good overall, although my mom called me upset this evening,  again .  She never seems happy.  This time she was upset with my dad about something that I thought was trivial, but she was up in arms about it.  Funny how she calls her son to bitch about her husband, AKA, her son's dad.  Like I want to be involved in a fight they're having?  Again, she's looking for validation, wants me to pick a side.  She's just not happy.  So I was bored.  Went to  urlLink Vera's  to try and finish up this gawdawful book I'm reading -  A Million Little Pieces .  It actually may have some value, but I've only got about 50 pages left and I haven't found any yet.  It's another memoir about a guy who went through treatment at Hazelden about 10 years ago and found an alternative to AA to stay sober.  More power to him if he can stay sober without AA, but I just wish the book were more exciting.     Dry : A Memoir , on the other hand, was much cooler.  Perhaps it was just because I related to it more... but in any case, Augusten Burroughs is a better writer.    Vera's got really crowded, and it was raining outside, so I decided to go to the  urlLink Wilde Roast  to get a bite to eat and sit next to the fire.  Got there and it was freezing inside and the fire wasn't on!  (funny when referring to a fire, you say on or off... at least I do when it's a gas fireplace)  I ordered a cobb salad anyhow - it was fantastic!  They have a pretty limited menu, but everything I've had there has been great!    A couple of buddies showed up and told me about a 7:00pm wednesday Jitters meeting that I think I'm going to try out this week.  They had just been to a meeting where somebody famous was attending.  They seemed to be surprised that he wasn't dressed in armani and clean shaven... seems normal to me, most celebrities aren't usually dolled up :-)  Other than that, though, they said it was a really good meeting about being grateful... yeah, you may not have a new car, and may rent (rather than own), but you've got a place to live, food on the table, friends, etc... keep reminding yourself that it could be  much  worse.  For alcoholics / addicts, you could be looking at jails, asylums, or death.  I was coming up in the elevator tonight and noticed that my sunburn from yesterday is turning into a nice tan!  Normally I get burnt and the skin is red-as-hell for a couple of days and then goes white, but I think I must have gotten just the right amount of sun this time!  Yeah!  ... if only I had been naked I wouldn't have these damned tan lines.  Went to the chiropractor again today.  It was a follow-up visit to the initial consultation.  A doctor sat me down and gave me an entire sales pitch about why I needed chiropractic treatment.  What he said to me all seemed reasonable, but it was entirely a sales pitch.  I finally told him, "look, I'll keep coming back as long as my insurance covers it.  After that, I'll consider it next year when the insurance hasn't been used up."  He seemed happy with that and agreed to show me the x-rays that were taken on the first visit.  Turns out that I may actually have a problem, as the x-rays showed a slight misalignment in the curvature of my spine at the neck.  He also said that from looking at my spine from the front or back, you can see it's not horizontal - it leans one way.  I asked him if it could have just been that I was leaning my head, which seemed reasonable to me... he said, but why would you lean your head?  If you're leaning your head one way, straight up must not be comfortable.  Sounded a little fishy.  Anyhow, I got all cracked-out again by a couple of hot guys, so I'll keep going back until the insurance runs out, and if I'm healthier for it, BONUS!  Anyhow, I'm rambling.  Going to tune into channel 600 and see what I can order up on pay-per-view.  Oh, and something's fishy with my gallery.  I'm reorganizing and adding photos to it, but they're showing up rather large - some images are a meg, which can take a long time to view on a dialup connection.  The gallery is supposed to size them down automatically, but it's not working.  Bear with me until I get things figured out.

      Went to the  urlLink Bolt Underground  tonight for the first time.  They just opened recently and I had heard that some Legion work needed to be carried there.  Anyhow, I loved it!  Super hot guys, very cool club - cool music, sweating boys/men, and a literal  underground  theme.  What more could a homo ask for?  It was strange seeing all of these guys on meth and drinking too much.  I should stress that  some  not all, were.  I didn't even really have an urge, though I wasn't jumping outta my shoes to get on the dance floor, either... but that's okay.  I don't miss it all that much, and perhaps some of the excitement I used to feel unnaturally will come back naturally.    Off to snooze land.

Went to the gay rodeo, run by the  urlLink NSGRA , in Hugo - about 30 minutes north of downtown minneapolis.  The rodeo was just a blast, and I got  urlLink tons of photos  - go check them out in the gallery.  Here's a teaser:     Here's another shot with my friend Tommy and I (I'm on the left).  He participated in a couple of the events and has a HUGE belt buckle!     Anyhow, I'm off for the night to see if I can go lasso in anymore cowboys!

       urlLink This article  in city pages outlines the events of a fictional blogger who was around for YEARS.  The blogger was written by  Plain Jayne  - a late twenties girl who shared her past rape experience, photos of herself and friends, and corresponded with her readers via email, instant messenger, and commenting on her site.  The blog was, at its heyday, getting 5,000 unique visitors a day - that's HUGE.  One day the character disappeared and some loyal readers began investigating, only to find out that the author was actually an author writing a fictional blog.   urlLink City Pages  interviews the author - a male, married, with two children, living in Woodbury, MN, who describes the project as  Interactive Creative Writing . Crazy shit.  Read it.

      OMG, I just had a super-fantastic day!  Started out with sleeping in until 11:00, which is someting I haven't done in probably a month.  Went to Spy House and got a blueberry muffin and a light roast.  Did my crossword puzzles.  Stopped over at Mom & Dad's and dropped off their coolers.  Fixed Mom's computer.  Dropped Dustin off at the airport (he's going to the Hamptons for the week - that  Bastard! ).  Picked  urlLink Jim  up at the Mall.  Went to the  urlLink gym  with Jim.  Went to an  urlLink NA meeting  with Jim.  Went to  urlLink Kowalski's  with Jim to pick up steaks and veggies.  Came home, grilled, ate, watched Andy Roderick on SNL - yummmmmy!  Did laundry.  Found my digital camera so I can take photos of the rodeo tomorrow!  Did four loads of laundry, and am just folding up the last of it.    Here's some Andy (went kinda crazy on Google):                 He totally looks like Ethan Hawke in this photo, and is it just me, or does it look like he's checking this guy out?    Funny story.  I lit the grill and the flames were getting rather high.  Jim didn't want anyone in the building next to us to think things weren't under control (they weren't).  Since I'm on a rather high floor, quite a number of people in the next building had a view of our fire.  Anyhow, Jim put the lid on the grill.... then the fire started coming out the bottom of the grill, so he took the lid off when a HUGE fireball jumped out at us - it was like something out of The Lord of the Rings!  We both screamed.    Not five minutes later a fire truck with sirens, lights, the whole works pulled up to the building.  I was about the turn off the lights and hide (the fire was under control by this point), when it drove off.  Phew.    Anyhow, gotta finish off the laundry and get to bed in fresh sheets :-)

      Okay, so I admit it - I'm a total sucker for a backrub.  I've actually hurt my back a couple of times before, probably due to not stretching properly in the gym, and had gone to a couple of different chiropractors.  During the pride festival, and the couple of days leading up to it, I had hauled around soooo many cases of iced tea, that I was starting to get a little sore.  Low and behold, directly across from our booth there was a chiropractic clinic giving out free 5 minute massages, so I  had  to go.    I ended up feeling guilty for going over not having any intention of signing up for any of their services so I made an appointment - it was only $10 so I thought what the heck.  Anyhow, I went yesterday after work and as turned out it was probably the best $10 I've ever spent!  Two super-hottie interns and one super-hottie chiropractor worked me over for about an hour.  I couldn't even believe it - I was in absolute heaven.  I'm now straightened out, cracked out, and going back for more on Monday and Wednesday next week!  It must be my higher power letting me know that I am somebody.

         I found this photo while browsing through  urlLink myspace.com  tonight.  Not something I normally do, btw, but I'm glad I did, or I never would have seen this thing!  Don't you hate it when it gets really humid during summer in Minnesota and the mosquitos start attacking you in flocks and it's so humid that even when a mosquito doesn't land on you, you're so paranoid that one is, and you feel a slight tingle from the humidity and you end up slapping any exposed skin over and over again?  Gawd I hate that.    Had more drama with my mother tonight, and I was already crabby at work all day from the drama the past few nights.  So what did I do?  I went on a little shopping spree at Best Buy :-)  I bought walkie-talkies and a new flash memory card for my digital camera, which equals more recent photos and spy games for me!   urlLink Jim  and I were walking / driving all over the best buy parking lot to try to see how far the range was on these babies when we started hearing the headsets from some Baby store.  "clean up in isle 3"  Oh, speaking of the parking lot at best buy - Jim and I spotted a super-duper-hottie walking out as we were walking in.  Blonde, tan skins, and bulging biceps exposed by a loose-fitting, though generously-exposing tanktop.  I looked over and he looked over at us, so then we looked away.  We looked back a moment later and he was doing the same thing.  Then we looked away again.  We played this game until we got to the entrance and he got to his car.  If you're reading this, hot stuff, write me!  LOL  Anyway, it's employee review time at the agency and I was supposed to have all six of the reviews I've been assigned turned in by 5:00 earlier today.  I'm done with four and have to finish these up before I go crazy filling in questions like, "does this person contribute to the growth of the agency and the clients' success?  how so?  please list examples"  ... and then followed by 49 similiar questions.  You see I'm  very  important so I have to do several.  At least that's what I keep telling myself ;-)    Anyhow, toodles, and don't forget,  you are somebody !

      I've been neglecting my blogging lately.  I suppose it's because I had a routine down prior to getting laid off... I always had my window of time when I blogged.  Now that my routine's been thrown out of whack, I've had trouble finding the time, or being in the right mood, to blog.    Things are going pretty good.  I've been in good spirits.  Still have a few different avenues to explore.  I'm not sure that I'm going to re-enter the advertising world right now, but if something came along, I probably wouldn't turn it down.    Looking into opening a franchise.  Looking into going into real estate.  Just not sure which direction I want to go in right now, so I'm just talking to people and trying to learn from their experiences.    I had a former client of mine IM me today.  He had just left on a two week vacation when I was laid off, and just returned to work.  He was really bummed that I wouldn't be around anymore.  He promised to call me next time he was in town and take me out for cocktails.  He doesn't know (yet) that I'm sober now... so that was a sort of odd  conversation.  I didn't really address it directly and just skirted around the drink issue.  The chiropractor visits have increased in frequency - I'm now going 3 times a week instead of just 2.  It's absolute heaven!  I hadn't had a massage in a while, either, but being short on funds, was hesitant to splurge on one.  I decided to call The Aveda Institute and get a student massage.  It's pretty discounted - only $54 for an hour and twenty minutes.  I got there and ended up getting an 80 girl who was only on her FIRST DAY of massage.  It totally sucked - she didn't press hard enough and I ended up just falling asleep.  I wouldn't advise it.  Spend the extra dough and get the real thing!  With my 'vacation' I've also been able to explore different AA meetings.  I'm enjoying that, as I am meeting new people and learning more all the time.  I'm also reading a book about Buddhism.  I don't know much about it yet, but what little I've read thus far is very intriguing.    OH, and the REALLY good news!!!  I don't think I've blogged about this yet, but the roommate has decided to stay in town!!!  I'm so relieved.  He's really been a positive influence on me and I don't know what I'd do without him.  I'm thrilled he's sticking around.    Anyway, should probably get to bed - I have another busy day tomorrow doing odd jobs for friends :-)

        I`m all set to go to the gym this morning, but my gym buddy is MIA.    Roommate went to Sturgis last night - I really wish he'd stop travelling so much - so I find myself somewhat lonely again :-(  The thought of one of the biggest retail queens on a harley from here to the west coast really cracks me up, though.  He's a multifaceted individual, that's for sure.  I'm going to a Minnesober planning meeting tonight.  Minnesober is the annual GLBT AA Roundup.  This is my first time volunteering for something this large within AA.  I've done greeting and readings before, but this will actually require that I be held accountable for something - oooooh!  Meeting at a friends house for dinner tonight with the group of AA peeps I've been hanging with since I've gotton sober.  They're a great bunch of guys and I feel truly blessed to have fallen into their circle and been welcomed by them.  They're a large part of the reason I've been able to stay sober.    Met with a guy who found me online yesterday.  I suppose you could call it a date, but it was really just a face-to-face meeting to get to know each other better.  He seemed very cool and cute.  It's the first time in a long time that I've met someone I actually think I might like, so I fear I may have made somewhat of a fool of myself - I was nervous!  Which is strange for me ...  Anyhow, gotta hop in the shower after my workout to meet some friends for breakfast.  Have a great Sunday!

      ... and so far none more to go.  Actually, I'm quite grateful that I had two interviews this week.  Both went really well.  The first was just with a hiring manager.  During the second, I met with five people.  Phone calls keep coming and I still haven't had to do any of my own soliciting yet!  Things are looking good, but nothing solid yet.  I hope it doesn't drag on too long.  Job searching can be a depressing venture.  Heading to the chiropractor today to get all cracked out and straightened up.  God I love that place.  Been hankering for a good massage - does anybody have any recommendations here in town?  I've been to a few, but not overly impressed with anyone in particular.  I guess it's sorta like looking for a lover - someone who knows how to do it right :-)

      I've got another full day of fun planned today.  I'm grateful that I've been able to keep busy during my time of unemployment.  Down time for me tends to lead to insanity, so keeping busy is a good thing!  Roommate came in from out of town early yesterday, so caught up with him last night.  He's had ANOTHER job opportunity offered to him here in town, so now he's reconsidering the move all-together.  This is a good thing.  He's truly blessed to have so many people knocking on his door to have him come work for them.  I hope I have a similiar experience in my job search.  Speaking of the job search ... I've had several calls!  I have an interview today and tomorrow so far this week, and a plethora of people to call, and old contacts to reacquaint myself with.  It's terrible how you get busy and neglect your relationships with some people that you don't often see.  Then you lose your job (or need something), and you try to bring them back into your life... I hope they don't see me as the greedy whore that I can tend to be.    Anyhow, gotta run and drop roommmate off at the office, then it's off to the bank, the sprint pcs store, spin class, and more errands, oh and the job interview!
