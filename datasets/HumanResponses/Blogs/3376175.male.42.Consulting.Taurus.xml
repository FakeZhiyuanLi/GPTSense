      e·nun·ci·ate    ( P ) v. e·nun·ci·at·ed, e·nun·ci·at·ing, e·nun·ci·ates v. tr.     1. To pronounce; articulate.    2. To state or set forth precisely or systematically: enunciate a doctrine.    3. To announce; proclaim.  For many years I have listened to news casters, politicians, and other noted public speakers butcher the english language.  For some reason they refuse to enunciate words and in my eyes, sound like idiots.  I don't claim to speak correct english 100% of the time, but neither do I collect a paycheck for public speaking.  I can underestand if the speaker is reporting on a specific region, or dialect to use some of the vernacular, based on the body of the story.  But to listen to the evening news, or to watch a TV commercial, and hear someone who is paid to speak, talk the way they do.  If they make a living with public speaking, they should make an effort to learn to correctly speak so they can intelligently get their message across.  Some Nations like to add letters, or remove letters from recognized dictionary words, and the word almost loses it's meaning because of the enunciation, or lack thereof.  " 'Mericans, that live in Warshington, may ocassionally get a leaky ruf, and they cans't afford to fix it, so they ast a famlly me'ber, who works in a libary fo' the money".  This is but a small sample of what is heard on the News regularly.  IF they were doing a story that needed the previously mentioned vernacular, fine, but tune in and really listen to your local news, and hear for yourselves, what I mean.

      With all the hype these days, about water on Mars, is water really necessary for life?  The way we understand life, yes.  But why are the experts so arrogant as to assume water is needed for ALL life.  Why are the experts so arrogant to assume we are the ONLY life in the universe?  If TV is any indication at all (the science fiction shows) and Sci-Fi novels for that matter, then we are not alone. If you use the addage of "When there is one, there are more", we can't possibly be alone in the universe.  How can we assume that life on earth is the only things to evolve and flourish.  If it happened here, on earth, it had to have happened somewhere else.  Our technology can't as yet, determine that there are NOT other planets that could or do support life.  Our experts, and technology can't as yet determine that ALL life is based on water.    What about the history of UFO's, going back for many hundreds or even thousands of years.  How are they explained in terms of where they are from?  There have been thousands of sightings of UFO's and "Martians", what are their planets like?  Obviously their technology is better than ours, how can you explain the space ships they use.  But as the experts claim, we ARE alone, at least they are open to the concept of life on another planet.  We just have to get them away from the concept of water is the ONLY clue to life.

      Lets get something straight first off. I understand that online contests/lotteries/giveaways are sometimes a way to scam you out of personal information. But there are alot out there that offer legitimate contests. I personally have not won any major prizes, but have won small $$ amounts, from various online sites. What is with all these people that offer online contests that require you to fill in an email address and name to continue on to the actual personal info page, ONLY to find out that the contest is not available in your area. So now they have your email, worse yet some personal info, for a contest you can't play, and you get onto their/another mail list. With the amount of SPAM out there, we don't need more. There should also be a way to legitimately get off of these said list, and not hear from these people again. But for that to happen there would have to be solid legislation and hefty penalties to prevent this abuse. SPAM is with us for the time being, there seems no end in sight for the Viagra, Penis enlarging, mortgage, you name it SPAM that we can't seem to end. In a "smoke" filled world, no SPAM would be nice, I remember the days of ONLY having 4 REAL emails in my INBOX, now I get somewhere between 100 and 200 a day, most of them are from the mortgage, penis enchancment, drug emailers that clog my TRASH folder. ISP's should step up and enable filters (SPAMHAUS.COM) to get rid of this before we get it.

      ISP's/free mail hosts sites should maintain a database of these people so that they can "fix" the problem that these email addresses create.  If after say 3 spam's and the email address is NOT compromised, the registered user should have their account suspended for a 1 week period, for the first offense, and get longer until they eventually get their account terminated.  If the email address is compromised, ie: a worm or trojan is allowing someone else to abuse the email address(s), then the ISP should force the account holder to upgrade their software with firewalls, anti-virii, worm/trojan removers, before their account is terminated, IF they do not comply.  If someone legitimately belongs to an email list and regularly sends out multiple emails to multiple recipients, they should be required to notify their ISP/free mail host that they send emails like that.  If they are ONLY using the account to send SPAM, it should be immediately terminated, upon verification of known SPAM practices.  Scanning software should also be used by ISP's/free mail hosts to scan email's AS they get sent, and known SPAM keywords are found, the email should immediately get stopped and the account user notified, or account terminated.
