         Cancer is not a death sentence , it is reversible, that conventional treatments are not effective as claimed,   tumor is only a symptom of a degenerated body .  Health restoration is the goal and the journey. From whatever source, their fears were allayed and hope raised their spirits, giving them courage to boldly declare self-reliance. Inspired they open their eyes to a glorious world they never knew existed.  Hope became the seed for ingenuity.     http://www.westayhealthy.com/survst.html

      http://www.eyesontheprize.org/stories/leslies.html  I cannot describe the shock of that second Diagnosis. I went from  potential cure to odds of four-to-one-against my surviving five years....   For those of you who are facing this, you should know that I am writing  this in April 2002, and odds or no odds, I am clinically and  radiologically disease free. This December, I will be five years out  from The Diagnosis. So far I have beaten the odds and so can you.  Whatever the odds you are given, remember that someone has to be in the  5% or 2 % or 20% who survive and it MIGHT AS WELL BE YOU---

      Tim and I attended our local church to pray for Tina's recovery. We filled out prayer request cards in Tinas name. At the end of the morning service Tim and I went to the front of church to and meet with prayer partners.  The prayer partners prayed with us for Tina's recovery, for Anthony and for Thomas.

      Dear Family and Friends,  This is letter is intended to inform the family and friends of Tina Farrell’s critical medical condition and to request a regime of prayer on her behalf. Tina has been diagnosed with Stage 4B Cervical Cancer that has metastasized to distant locations to include her lungs, diaphragm and lymph nodes. Currently Tina is at Stanford Medical Center in San Francisco where it has been determined she is not a candidate for surgery. She will be returning home to receive chemotherapy and radiation treatments to “shrink” the affected areas and ultimately will return to Stanford a better candidate for a surgical procedure that will remove the remaining tumors.   Our family believes in the love and healing power of Jesus Christ. We stand firm in our belief of the awesome miracle He has in store for Tina. We know that Jesus is still in the “miracle business” and that is what we are asking all to pray for, a miracle.  We are requesting that all receiving this letter will say this simple prayer,   			Jesus we believe in your wonderful healing power 			We Thank You for all of our blessings 			We Come before you to lift Tina up to you We ask you to lay your wonderful healing hands on her, remove all the cancer from her body Return her to her place in life as a mother and a “soon-to-be” new wife with a healthy new body. Give Tina the strength to endure what is to come and to continue being a testimony to your perfect sweet mercy We pray this in your sweet name Jesus. Amen	    “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future” Jeremiah 29:11  With Great Faith in Christ, Tina’s Family

      Dear Friends and Family,   I would like share with you some tragic news that has been given to our family today.  My sister, Tina Goodman of San Luis Obisbo, has been stuck with cancer again and this time the diagnosis is especially grim. Her lungs, diaphragm, and beyond, have been attacked by Squamous tumors. I am not writing to you to elicit your empathy (although, it is greatly appreciated ) but more for action. I am asking that you pray to God for her life.  Pray that her 7-year-old son Thomas will have a mother to raise him. Pray that her fiance, Anthony, can marry her as planned this September. Pray that our family not bear the weight of life without her sense of humor.  Please post your thoughts of support and encouragement here.

                            Gynecological Cancers (Cervical, Endometrial, Ovarian,  Uterine)       Start making powerful changes NOW to help you get on the fast track to  health! This week:       Eat two servings of fish.    Eat a breakfast cereal that contains at least 10 grams of dietary fiber per  serving.    Eat three vegetarian meals.       Why these changes?    Cold water fish and flax, sources of omega-3 fatty acids, may slow tumor  growth and reduce the spreading capability of cancer cells. For example, salmon  oil has effectively killed human cervical cancer cells in test tube studies.     High-fiber cereal grains contribute fiber and phytates, which help to   remove excess circulating estrogen  from the body and provides cell  protecting antioxidants, respectively.     Finally, vegetarian women tend to have the lowest estrogen, levels, so eating  plant-based meals may help you control your gynecological cancer   &nbsp;    http://www.challengecancer.com/nutrition-tipsgynecologicalcancers.cfm

      I went to visit Tina in the hospital yesterday expecting to find a sleepy-eyed kitten mewing for milk - hardly. Tina was up and giving a pep talk to a newly diagnosed cancer patient in her room, dragging behind her cables, cords, and tubes. Needless to say, the feeding tube has restored Tina's energy and the tumor seems to be reacting (shrinking) positivly to the radiation. Tina shared with me that she is also able to eat some food by mouth and she can now feel it travel to her stomach. Yeah Yeah Yeah! Check out the picture of Tina and her tulips that Rich sent her.

      There is a blessing to report... Tina will receive the feeding tube she so desperately needs, after a significant amount of weight loss it has been determined that the best course of action to remedy this would be a feeding tube. Due to the placement of the cancerous mass pressing in on her esophogaus it makes eating very difficult coupled with the intense radiation it is even more difficult sustain the nutrition needed to endure this physically demanding time.  The procedure is scheduled for Monday but maybe moved to Sunday(tomorrow) at French Hospital in San Luis Obispo, please pray for Tina as well as her doctors, Dr. H'yashi and Dr. Rogers.  Jesus is our Healer

                       &nbsp;      Woman healed of 4th stage cancer      In Dec. of 1990 I was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the age of 39. The  doctors could give me no hope. I did have chemo and radiation, the doctors  thought that could prolong my life for a little while. In March of 1991 I had  surgery, thats when they found that the cancer had spread to my lymp nodes in my  right hip area and couldn't get it all with the surgery. Now it looked like 3-6  months is all I would live. It was a very aggressive form of colorectal  cancer.  While searching through the Bible, my mom and I found so many  promises on healing, in the old and new testament. I started writing them in a  notebook and those precious scriptures filled up pages and pages! In Hebrews  13:8 it is written that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever!  So if Jesus healed then, He could heal me now because also in Acts 10:34 it is  written that He is no respector of persons! Proverbs 4:20-22 says; My son, pay  attention to what I say, listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your  sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and  healing and health to all their flesh. The Hebrew word for "health" is medicine.  So I started taking God's Word like medicine every day. In fact thats what I  titled my notebook of all those precious scriptures "GODS MEDICINE".  It  was three years before the doctors finally gave me a good report. It was  certainly not an overnight miracle. There was a lot of pain and ups and downs  but, His Grace was sufficient. Jesus let me know that I was in the middle of  spiritual warfare, the devil wanted to kill me (John 10:10) and He wanted to  heal me for His glory. Jesus specializes in the hard cases!  He revealed  to me that in Matthew chapter 14, when Peter got out of the boat with his eyes  fixed on Jesus he could walk on the water but when Peter took his eyes off Jesus  and looked at the storm around him, he sank. So I, must keep my eyes focused on  Him and His Word and not on the storm of cancer all around me (the doctors  reports, test results, the pain, what other people said). He is so faithful to  His Promsies! There were so many different things that happened during this time  and afterwards but this is the story in brief. I give Jesus my Lord and Savior  all the glory and praise for healing me of 4th stage cancer.

      Tina started radiation on Monday and will continue treatment everyday along with a weekly chemotherapy regimen. She is physically doing well, however our prayer request this week, along with a miraculous healing is for Tina to gain weight. She has lost a significant amount of weight, the doctors indicate that it would be  best if Tina had a some extra weight to offset some of the effects of radiation/chemo. Please keep those prayers coming and we will continue to update all of you !!! Love, Lisa & Richard

      This was a quote from a gentleman who prayed over Tina at the Healing Rooms in Santa Maria. All of the sisters were able to attend and it was a wonderfully uplifting experience for Tina. Tina and her fiance have committed to attending the Healing Rooms as often as possible until the Dr. says "...why were you here again? we can't seem to find any trace of cancer"  or any variation along those lines :-) Tina received her last treatment (in this regimen) of radiation yesterday and will receive her last chemotherapy today, this will allow her a 2 week break in which her body will have a chance to heal as well as reevaluating how effective this regimen was. Our prayers request is that everyone focus their prayers to the mass blocking her ability eat, we are extremely grateful for the feeding tube which has afforded us the luxury of seeing Tina gain back the much needed weight, however we would love to see Tina taking food by mouth and enjoying the social aspect that has always surrounded the sisters and food :-) Tina was experiencing some pain in her shoulder and after ruling out a blodclot due to the port in her chest, she attended the Healing Rooms (last night) and thru the grace of Christ has received relief. Please pray this "break" time will be a great time of healing for Tina. &nbsp; Jesus Heals &nbsp;

      Tina has finished her second treatment in her first series of Chemotherapy, yesterday. She will require 10 more days of radiation and 2 more Chemotherapy visits before being reevaluated. Presently her Chemotherapy is comprised of a drug known as Cisplatin this will continue for the last two visits in this regimen, afterwhich Chemotherapy will be made up of a drug known as Ifosfamide.  Tina is doing as well as can expected and is sooo happy to have the letters and cards everyone has been sending.She is reading as much as she can regarding nutrition and cancer. Although her primary source of nutitional consumption is through her feeding tube(cancer specific nutitional supplements, which makes us laugh because they come in different flavors which of course Tina can not taste) we are anticipating her ability to take food by mouth very soon.  We are thanking Jesus for the healing he has in store for Tina. Please focus your prayers on the mass blocking her ability to swallow as well as giving praise to our Sweet Jesus for her recent weight gain (4 lbs in just under 2 weeks)YEAH!!  Jesus Lives Lisa

      Lisa, will you please add this to your blogspot.   Tina, they sang a beautiful song at Bellevue Baptist Church Sunday, July 4th.  The name of it was "Somebody is Praying me Through".  I just want you to know that we are all still praying you through.  We love you, Aunt Butchie & Uncle Jerry
