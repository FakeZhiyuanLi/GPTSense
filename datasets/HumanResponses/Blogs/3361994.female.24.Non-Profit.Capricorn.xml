      Well I am all finished moving and everything is almost normal in my office I have to wait until next week for the phone company to do their thing, and later this week for internet but I have my cell phone and that will do for now. I am sooooooo excited because I booked a summer vacation for my hubby and I today. We are going on a 4 night cruise in August and I cant wait. We will need it by then because our summer schedule is packed and at least 4 weeks of it are going to be spent apart from each other. So that will be good to do at the end of it all and then I will be ready to kick off the new school year all rested and refreshed.

      I don't know sometime I just don't feel like doing anything... I love my job, but I'm just lazy today. Maybe I will feel better later. I have been trying to find out some family tree information and have found somebody in the Netherlands that has some matching information so that's cool. I have begun the painting process in my new office but its a lot of work. Anybody wanna help?
