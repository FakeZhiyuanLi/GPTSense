           Silence has always been a dear&nbsp;friend of mine yet due to an unknown reason he had left me without bidding goodbye. This happened not too long ago. All these days, I try to brush off thoughts of him, of his sudden absence and why he had never tried to reach for me.   Then one night, I decided not to show up for work, in hopes of finding Silence. I still could remember his phone number. So I dialed the numbers. No one answered the phone. Strange, maybe I switched the last two digits. I tried again. Hoping this time I got it right. Someone did answer the phone. It was a woman’s voice – her aunt. I could sense the&nbsp;distasteful note&nbsp;in her voice when I asked for Silence. Her blunt response was that she had no inkling of his whereabouts.   Heavy in heart, I carefully placed the receiver back. “Where could he be at this time of night?” I asked myself. Then a thought shot through the back of my head. I simpered. Took my bag and told mom that I was going out to meet a friend.   The night air was humid and the dazzling cosmopolitan lights made this gaiety feeling of mine more obvious. I was wearing a dainty floral&nbsp;dress, just like Silence wanted me to wear. People were everywhere. And there was this cacophony of sounds that made it all more confusing. “This is where I’ll find Silence”, I said anticipatively.   I stopped by the coffee shop where we usually spend Friday nights swapping ideas of what to do about our campus paper. Before coming in, I subtly smoothened the little creases of my skirt – a sort of reassurance that It'll turn out fine. I ordered a latté and while waiting for my drink, my eyes began to search for him amongst the crowd of coffee drinkers. Fervently wishing that he’d see me first and join me in my solitary contemplation. Alas, after the last few sips of my warm beverage, there was still no presence of Silence.  I stood up and went out. There was this bored resignation on my face as I tried to muster the little courage I have left. There is no backing up, I have to move on and try finding him somewhere in this little city of lights.   While walking, I stopped and realized how prickly the cold pavement was. I looked down&nbsp;only to realize that I had no slippers on.   Weird.   All of a sudden I felt a jarring halt of insecurity and shame. “I need to find my slippers”, was my immediate thought. But there’s little time left and I must find Silence so I unyieldingly continued to walk barefoot in spite of the harsh glances I got from the passersby. Every step I took was like sheer torture, as I bear the pang that slowly crept on my spine.   Not too far away is a park. There I saw a bench where I could sit&nbsp;and&nbsp;decide where to search for him. As I went near the bench, I was surprised to find out that the bench was not empty. And there seated was a&nbsp;man. I was about to retreat but my heart began to pound fast. And I knew in&nbsp;an instant that it was Silence.   There he was seated, undisturbed by the surrounding festivity. He was dark and handsome and had these&nbsp;rings of&nbsp;curls on his hair. &nbsp;His head arched, and I could see the tip of his nose. I also&nbsp;sensed that he was&nbsp;in deep thought. Could he be&nbsp;thinking about me?&nbsp;I sat down beside him and tapped his shoulder.   &nbsp;“Silence, I’ve been looking for you everywhere”. I said.   He looked up and gave me this glassy stare. “I know that you’ve been searching for me.” He said.   “I miss you so much, please tell me you’ll stay.” I said in a coaxing manner.   He said not a word but in his eyes I could see that he didn’t want to stay any longer. I tried to&nbsp;peer closely at his eyes&nbsp;and see if there was anything&nbsp;that he beheld for me.   “Why aren’t you not glad? I’ve been so alone, people are after me and I have not yet gotten a decent sleep since you went away.”   “I’m so cold and in pain.” I said in a cracked voice.   Gently he clasped my hands and kissed my forehead. I thought that he would wrap me around his arms but he slowly got up and stepped back.&nbsp; He said he could no longer be with me. That he would only make me weak. Silence told me that the love he thought he had for me was just a shadow of a man’s passions.   “I can’t take care of you anymore, Lyn. You’ve already grown up and there is something more than this that awaits you.  ” I felt that my ears were trying to betray me. I could not believe that he uttered these words. And soon hot tears were trickling down.   “Don’t cry now. You ought to be strong.” He said.  “How could you say such a thing when it’s always you that I think of?” I said in between sobs.   “Do you not need me?” I implored.   “Trust me. I know what’s best for you. Go home now and forget that this night ever happened.” He said in a certain tone.   I got up and dried my tears with my handkerchief. I walked away from the bench, after a few steps. I looked back again, hoping to get a last glimpse of Silence.   He was nowhere in sight.   I sighed and then I felt something underneath my soles. I looked down and saw my slippers, cradling my feet from the pavement’s biting cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Everything you could have been  And everything you'll be  Everything you dream about  And everything you see   All the times you feel so much  And times you let them go  Times you thought you wanted love  And times you'll never know   Parts of you, you cannot hide  Part I'll never see  Parts that want to be alone  And parts you share with me   All these things make you a whole  A love like no one could  And this is why I dream of you  In ways I always would   For friends; would it be enough for me?  I know it has been years  But it has grown to more than this  Despite my greatest fears   Take a look behind these eyes  And see the death of me  The love I feel for my friend  Though he will never see

      Lone and forgotten  Through a long sleeping  In the heart of age  a child woke weeping   No visible mother was with her there Laughing and nodding from earth and air  No elfin comrades  came to her call And the earth and air was blank as well  The darkness thickened upon her creeping In the heart of age a child lay weeping

        First and foremost: I am no feline lover. . Cats have this air of superiority that seems to fill the room and it is too much for me to bear. Stealthily, sophistication in every stride. They glance at you condenscendingly as if it is a raging insult to look at them fondly. Don't even attempt petting them - especially when they have just licked themselves clean - lest you end up with a scratch or two. Wait, did you mention bath? Oh! They' ll claw your hands like wooden posts! And when the garden reeks of that peculiar odor, don't blame the dog. It is probably the poop that was not covered properly by the supposed "I'm-cleaner-than-everyone-else-in-the-universe" creature.      &nbsp;   For some unknown reason, they also tend to sneer at humans who call them cutesy-artsy names. It is funny how Filipinos have the urge to christen any cat as "Ming-ming," "Muning," or "Ning-ning" (as if calling them with chime-like names would make them jump on your lap and slobber your hands with affection.

      George Mallory was once asked why he was climbing Mt. Everest. His succinct reply was, "Because it's there." He then climbed to his death.   Call me a cynic, but this is how I see dating. I used to be one of those newly-broken up optimists who feels like a dog let out of her cage for the first time, certain of the possibility of studly sires or endless opportunities. Goal oriented, motivated, primed and armed for seduction, I was ready. Why? Because it was there!   The sporting life can be fun. To some it comes as a phase, to others a lifestyle. However, little by little you realize that the liquid shimmer you put&nbsp; on your chest to attract glances is causing nothing but an eruption of acne. The booze you use to fuel your mojo is nothing more than the firestarter for disaster. The cute face that you thought was "it" suddenly annoys you and makes you pay for his gas. It's all a denouement from there.   For pros, the Beck of dating, it's all about the game, there is no losing just moving on. However, for non-pros with a serious handicap called "romanticism", it all gets boring. It becomes a senseless opera of calculated chaos and scientific seduction.   With the rose-colored glasses of Hollywood romances off, I had a moment. Not too long ago and not too poignant either in the classical sense. It was my friend's birthday at V, I had just come from the office wearing a tank top older than my last relationship, jeans and flip flops (cool factor: Havainas) My face as rich in oil as Kuwait devoid of any color. I was dressed to be killed. The place was packed but nary a familiar face came my way. I entered V alone, you know how the steps light up when you step on it. Well, that day it seemed to light up so much brighter that I wanted my movie star on mogs shades that moment! Yet as it always happens to me, a certain catharsis always hits me at the most cliche of places.   Here I was in a plce where I have entered with several of my "The One" du jours over the past few years. Now I was alone, dressed like Oliver Twist, and I felt so fuckin' happening. It was going to be this way for a long time I said to myself...and there was nothing wrong with it at all.   There are plenty of metaphors for being alone. You can be married and be alone. You can be polygamous and still be alone. You can be screwing more bulbs than Mr. Gadget and still be alone. My kind of alone was the best kind.   Being alone is sort of unnatural really. Biologically we are compelled to couple (or more depending how indulgent one is). We are culturally programmed to have a partner or a pack. Check out dining places, its tables for eight, six, four or two. Those who choose to dine alone can opt for the bar, where the Lone Ranger can contemplate on his solitude with a dirty martini as his main course. Even having coffee alone solicits a few pitiful glances. Even in prison the most excessive punishment is being thrown in the solitary chamber. Being alone is supposed to hurt, says Shakespeare, Hornby and the guy in "Cast Away". Then why do I feel so crazy good?   Sure, life is quite ironic these days listening to Burt Bacharch as I order sweet and sour pork from North Park at midnight surfing through page six.com or any other inane website. After a breakup you are just ready to be a rock star, macking and playing the open field. Then depending on how many mooseheads you've successfully shot and mounted on your Hall of Shame, there comes a time when the game gets a little bit old.   After a hurricane of seeing and partying you learn to see the signs. In my case it was a black eye from the security guard gate bar at San Lorenzo (thanks schmucks!) that hit me sober and not an inch numb from alcohol. That should have meant something - stay home, get fat and watch tv. But no, with some Cinema Secrets magic (concealer that could literally erase your face) I was back on the dancefloor. Then my right leg went numb. Literaly for weeks I was wondering what it was, I went through days of arduous test and the only conclusion my doctor could draw up was that I had too much alcohol/caffeine in my system. I was a wreck. All I had was myself and I was already dying on me, something had to give.   Society these days measure you for what you have. From the friends that you keep, the food that you eat and the man that you hoodwink into marrying you.  This you-are-what-are-society are all 'bout plurals and that's why prescription drugs are at an all-time high. You are born alone, you die alone, so what's wrong with living alone. Alone in a sense that you live in your own terms you are comfortable enough to have yourself as your constant date and yet still live a life that is the anathema of Howard Hughes.   It's not life I have given up on my Everest. I want to see how it feels to like to truly believe that the world is my oyster. I have given up some opportunities only to be near my dearest one. Not because separation is too hard, but because he might cheat (kidding!). The moment I was freed from my last teleserye, I swore to never subject myself to that kind of mental aerobic exercise of paranoia ever again.   It's so tiring. And unless this man is the love of your life, the whole paranoia bit has a lot to do with ego. You don't want to get the shaft - again! That's the liberating thing about humility. You don't end up wanting much, expecting much - and when fortune befalls on you, you understand why it all happened. Especially during the holiday season, many single women cry wishing they could stuff their stockins with any guy who would cal back. And single men will find themselves stuffing bills on stripper's stockings. But being alone should not be this dismal.   I find myself in the fork of solitude, realize that this might be the last time I have my life for myself. I'm just enjoying it, thinking a life that will be crammed with other people's wants and needs later on. For now it's just me and my idiosyncrasies, so indulge them.Whether this last for a year or forever, I will be bathing in this freedom. Unlike Mallory, my kind of Everest is something I'll stumble on whle I'm dancing the foxtrot. No need to climb to my death. Yet when it happens it will be exquisite, like an Atkins devotee eating their first dish of Mac and Cheese for the first time!   People have all sorts of excuses on why they choose to give on installment instead of just laying it on one blow. I understand the circumstance can make you wiser in terms of self-defense, but that spirit of adventure and abandon that pros in dating see as steroids (it may heighten the experience but you lose the stamina after), is a no-no to the educated Casanova.  In Manila, the choices are so limited really. You know the saying that when a camel is thirsty it will drink sand. Well there are millions of sandmen and sandwomen to settle for. However, is it worth settling for? I'm sick of it, I'm sick of the Becks of dating. I'm just goint ot have my Eggs Benedict at Lumiere, read my trashy tabloids alone on Sundays and maybe treat myself to a half bottle of bubbly as I watch Pulp Fiction for the 50th time.   Two is great but one is not half bad at all! It's all or nothing for me. Either way I will relish what I deserve for the moment.  * whew, now that was a long one...hope it doesn't eat up all the space here...later.

      "Merci" is the French word for "Thank You."  On Air France on the way to a connecting flight in Paris theFrench speaking crew kept using the word "Merci."  In the Paris airport the word kept popping up again.&nbsp; I becamesensitive to it.&nbsp; "Merci" sounds virtually identical to theEnglish word Mercy, just a slight difference in enunciation.  Perhaps their tonal similarity is spiritually connected. When we are thankful, mercy follows.  When things go bad in our world, I often find that thethankfulness is also gone.&nbsp; We focus far more on the things thatgo wrong than on the things going right.  We wonder why has God abandoned us?Why are we forsaken?Why have things gone so sour?Why is everyone else doing OK but us?  When that happens we've usually forgotten about all of thethings gone right. Merci is a word we no longer speak; therefore, mercy is a thingwe no longer see.  You are reading this absolutely free right now.There is no advertising.It is one of the MANY little things that enter into your worldeach day that's on the good side.

      He was like a dream. Or should I say, he was the dreamy sort of bloke.   He treats me like a princess. While I treat him just average.   He talks about his campus orgs when I'm struggling for a dying career.   If there is one injustice in this world that I hate most, that would be my case scenario with this guy.   Yesterday he called. Fortunately, I was in deep slumber so&nbsp;mom had no choice but to tell the poor boy to call back. The only thing that bugged me was when mom woke me up early just to make sure I get to answer his call.   The blushin' boy did not call back. Isn't that amazing?   I thought that I was free and that I could go back to my dreamland.   Instead the "emotional flip-flop"&nbsp;came for a visit. Definitely wrong timing.   So he was there, in our sala getting comfy and all. While I was trying to put some sense in everything he has to say. I guess, when you're lacking of sleep it's just not registering right.   Mom was just too glad to see him. Serving him tea, they seem to jibe well. Why can't he just visit mom instead of me? They do make a great tandem.   In between sips, I can't help but excuse myself every now and then. Not because that am worried sick of my pale face but it's just that I don't want to see him anymore.   Problem is, he's just not giving up. And worst, he has mom's sympathy.   It's been 3 weeks that he did not showed up nor called me. And I was so glad about it hoping to open a bottle of&nbsp;bubbly anytime sooner. But now all of a sudden he's back, trying to drive me insane. Trying to push my limits when I have nothing left to feel for this guy.   I knew all along that he's gonna stay longer than the usual. Maybe have dinner with us. Two hours was like eternity for me. Then finally&nbsp;he got up and said that he had to go home.   I guess he sensed my indifference. The charm that used to be there was replaced with this undemonstrative look.   Thank God mom didn't ask him to stay&nbsp;for dinner.   "I hope that'll be the last of him", I silently wished while fixing the bouquet of flowers he gave me.   And then again, maybe not.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I went to the ATM today to get money.   As I stood in line a fellow came up to stand in line behind me.He said to another friend that he seemed to know that was walking up at the same time.   "I ran out of money."   I finished getting money from the ATM as the gentleman behind me stepped up.   A thought crossed my mind.   I turned and said to him,"You didn't run out of money.Running out of money is when there is none in the bank, you can't get any out of the ATM, and you don't have any anywhere else.   That's running out of money."He looked at me and said, "you are absolutely right, I guess I hadn't looked at it that way, I'm not out of money."   Far too many times we look at our situations in life and thinkthat we are "OUT" when in reality, we have plenty, it's just not jingling in our pocket at the moment.   I am not just talking about money.   We complain that we are out of love, power, happiness, joy,peace, rest, health, satisfaction, beauty, etc.&nbsp; The list goeson and on..   I don't know what's in your bank.

      It's been 3 days since mom brought back an accoustic guitar from the South. Such a baby...T'was a pity though to have such a work of art go lying idle in our sala. So that alone urged me to do something - and that is to learn how to make music out from this stringed instrument.  Learning how to play a guitar is not an easy thing as compared to playing like a fool (which comes out naturally on me :P) Honing one's skill in playing the guitar requires discipline, perseverence and calluses on my fingertips.   Definitely NOT a cute factor for holding hands with your special one. Now, this reminds me of an agitating scene in Margaret Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind"...now, how did that scene go? Oh erase! Erase!  Yet the possibility of serenading someone special (hope it will compensate for the calluses), tickles my fancy - eventually, I will master this and become the newest addition to the steady decline of female guitarists in the country.   Such ambition...  Funny, I only know 3 chords (D, A and G) three basic chords for a chobit song ("Let me be with you") I have yet to play this song without having to look at my fingers. Too bad, these fingers of mine aren't fit for guitar-playing, so they say - chubby and soft. But that will not dampen my spirit.   Sore fingertips&nbsp;will be the "main course" from this obsession of mine. Anytime sooner, it'll harden and peel off -ouch! French manicures no longer a necessity, a nailcutter will do fine (such savings!). Things I have to give up just for the love of music. It might pay off someday. For now, I'll just go ahead and practice those 3 chords - and add some more in between practices.   It's raining outside, gotta do some practice again...

      Just yesterday I had a moment. I had a break from the numerous gunk that's being shown on tv; recycled reality shows, telenovelas as mushy as the slosh found on the gutter and star searches that I find eye-crossingly dull. It wasn't planned. I showed up early for work only to find out that it was my day off...Shoot! So since I was in Eastwood city without a celphone (hell, I don't really need one), I had to do something worthwhile...and that is to go&nbsp;catch a movie.  Cinema tickets cost 150 bucks!! grrrr...I sure busted my budget (is this some sort of punishment for not checking blue pumpkin??)But for Spiderman who cares? Anyway as far as comfort and accoustics are concerned it was worthit.   Like the first movie, the second's good. It simply highlights the importance of being principled, of sacrificing one's dreams/desires for a good cause. That thought smacked me from the moon and back. It's like the itsy-bitsy spider...you see it there crawling doing nothing menacing but still it irritates you. It's there as much as you'd like to swat it, you just can't but still it triggers something on you. And that's when I realize that there is an issue that resurfaces...something that I don't want to tackle but it just shows up unexpectedly.  Now am starting to fall for nerdy Peter Parker and his alter-ego "Spidey". Like Spidey I sometimes feel that I tend to forget my dreams just to do something that's right. But sometimes I find it confusing, isn't it also bad to deprive myself from realizing my dreams?   Hmmmm....I think I have to ponder on this, later

      &nbsp;don't know how this love and hate relationship that I have with music began...All I know for sure is that I come from a long line of musicians (very innate with Cebuanos) so probably I luckily got their genes and not dad's hmmmm....anyway back to the issue.  I first had a taste of music playing at the tender age of 4, I believe. It was a Regal weinstein piano that i had in Dumaguete. Weinstein pianos basically sound like "tinkerbellish" with all the fancy woodwork, the soprano kind of piano. Though I was good at piano, I still harbor this fancy of playing the violin (not faithful). I could not count the many times I've tried to persuade mom to buy me one. After those many times of complaining I gave up and continued my piano playing just like a little good girl ought to do. Everything went well although I still could not shake off the dream of getting a hold of a violin until...  Mom decided that it was time to go back to Manila and live with Dad. We had to sell the piano. All of a sudden I felt as if a family member was taken away without my consent. I cried that day when that old lady took my piano. Funny, to just realize its value once its gone.   Back in Manila, everything was quite normal, happy cause I've got Dad beside me but still I felt the house was empty without the piano, without my music.   So we went downtown and happened by a second-hand piano shop along aurora boulevard. Dad was a bit broke and mom was just a plain housewife at that time so they thought that a second hand piano might just do the trick. There were no Weinsteins in that shop...sorry darling. So I ended up getting a Mozart...Now Mozarts are masculine in form. A German-made piano with no fancy woodwork it just sports the minimalist look.Bulky in exterior it was not meant for a fragile girl to play on. It sounded like a bass piano, strong like the roaring thunder, pretty handy during my emotional bouts :P  Me and Mozart went pretty well...although he was an old piano and with old age came complications, the piano tuner had to visit every now and then.I grew up and realized that there were also other fascinating things to ponder about like- boys and getting into the honor roll so I forgot about Mozart.   Then came again the time that Mozart had to leave, mozart was continuing to be expensive to maintain so mom decided to donate him for the church - so sweet of her.So for a year or two I led life without music except from what I hear on the radio (bad music really)   Then came my infatuation with electronic keyboards. Every time we'd stroll along the music shops in Ali Mall I'd see musicians strutting their stuff. I'd hear myself silently say "I wish I had that keyboard" So here does it, pops bought me a casio midi organ, you know the one that professionals use, one of the latest models at that time. It had like 120 instruments, 120 melodies/accompaniments and a lot more. That initiated my mom to have me take keyboard lessons...  Electric keyboards are very portable but nothing beats the classic sound of the piano. They lack the sensitivity to the pianist's touch. Every key sounds the same whether I pound the keys or just slightly press it. Somehow along the way I realized the imperfections/shortcomings of an electronic organ. And that's making me plan ways of how I could get some money to buy&nbsp;the real thing&nbsp;- someday.  The rest is history...I guess I'll never have enough of music.

      Not too long ago I had a night out with my best bud of 7 years- Rhoda. It's been like ages since we had real bonding time, especially now that she's so wrapped around her current beau, her third I believe(not that I mind) but I guess am just seeing less of her.   Back to the topic.   I guess what makes us click is our differences. That struck such a resonant chord in our relationship. We always see it as an "add on" if one of us has something new to offer instead of livin' in plain drudgery.   Rhoda Mae's the person who introduced me to this wonderful world of intoxication. It used to be that I perceive drinking as plain: Evil, foolish and very unwomanly. Well, drinking with her dismissed all of that notion.  Yes, she's the devil who made me try cigarettes (but never did liked it!), taught me how to use makeup, made me talk about sex, we even skipped classes etc. I have to say she made me feel more liberal. Made me feel more normal...unlike the way I used to in high school.   So back to intoxication.   Yes, dad and mom once tried to lure me...but I guess drinking with your pops and ma is no "cool" thing when you're young and into partying. And I might just end up splurging all the juicy little dark secrets with 'em (definitely not cool alright!)   But with Rhoda, just one bottle of beer goes a long, long way. True. I begin with this grave look of despair and after a few sips I go deliriously happy. Visions start to go fuzzy and I begin to blab all about the lil blundering moments of my solo life.&nbsp;&nbsp;She who's also one hell of a talker (and drinks like a fish) knows how to give the punchlines in between, which I suppost (sic) makes it all hilarious!   The rest is history (no need to elaborate)   Will just wake up one morning and find ourselves doing some recap while sipping mocha java or a latté at Starbucks.   I say, life's really one hell of a headache.&nbsp; Then again maybe not. I don't know if its the beer or the good company. Both I bet.   Once tried to drink alone - I just ended up placing my knickers in some place I couldn't remember. Bummer!!!   All I can say for now is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I thank her mom for her existence and also for the guy who discovered beer.

        Daijoubu         A simple word that I habitually utter. Sadly, it has come to a point that this word is losing its essence. Mayhap the word's used as a disguise to dupe others or just to simply swerve from what's real. I find it strange to say that I sometimes feel like I was doing some folly by just uttering this -  daijoubu         Just like the other day, ironically I lost my appetite. I knew for sure that there was too much bile churning in my belly but I could not get myself to nibble the cake. My suitor looked at me with discernment. He then asked me if there was anything wrong. Probably hoping to catch a chink.      For a split second, I wanted to tell him something of great import then I easily shrugged it off and told him I was alright.       Forsooth!       And just a few hours ago, on my way to work. I had a whiff of a scent that reminded me of someone. De facto, it was more of the feelings that I had for that person. That got me into staring blankly ahead. My friend was quick to notice it. Then I just gave her my usual retort - Daijoubu    Saying "I'm alright" without an ounce of emotion, feels like I'm hanging at the edge of a dangerous precipice. Or more like getting lost in a faceless crowd. Methinks I am bound to dupe myself more than I could possibly do to others...Oh yes,  I'm the Great Pretender!

       Out Here Hope Remains ... what kind of blog is this?   * First, it's a blog that may not exist ... if existence requires readers. If someone blogs on the internet and no one reads, does it cost more?   * I think there was some hope that great concepts that require input from varied sources would be discussed here in such a way that there would be amazement at both the enlightenment and ignorance of the writers.   * Shall it be scholarly ... careful (some of my parishoners may actually read this stuff!) ... funny ... dispassionate ... foggy ... or ... what? Yes, but not too much.   * Risky ... yes ... the more one reveals about his own thoughts, the more open he is to attack! Some people never think about being attacked by others. They have never been attacked. The ones who have been shot in the back will always be a bit wary. But what's the fun of reading a bunch of carefully crafted material that may be couched in language that is vague enough to warrant more than one interpretation in case of attack? No fun to me.   * So, I'm not too worried about writing "articles" ... trying to be funny or serious ... trying to fit in one mold or another ... I think I'll just be me here (with a normal amount of hiding of the worst about me, and a normal amount of magnifying whatever good about me). Jake says he has some contributions to make to the blog.  Right. I have invited another twenty-something person to contribute ... but ... I'm not sure he can figure it out. Actually I'd like someone who has a lot of friends to become a main contributor ... so someone would actually read. Thanks, Jedi for reading ... which makes me wonder ... just how bored are you? (those are not beers ... done with drinking...they are ... um ... apple ciders ... with ... whipped cream on top ... geez ... paranoia is a creeping form of protestantism.)

       The night was just coming to life highlighting a moon crescent that was perfectly incomplete. There she was alone, standing on the edge of the shore, holding on to a half empty bottle of beer like it was a prop. She could hear the waves crashing in and out on the water while a myriad of diamonds bounce off foamy waves, sparkling in the moon glow for a split second only to get swept away by waves crashing at the shore.  Obviously, she was trying to ignore the maddening monotony of those sad songs that were being played on a nearby hut.  For a moment she was contented with the solitude but then out of the darkness, save for the lone moonlight; was him, watching her from a near distance. She noticed right away that he was walking towards her. She quickly returned her icy gaze back to the swaying waves.  “I—I’m---sorry—“ he managed to mumble.  She turned her head and met his gaze. “Try not to think about it.” Her voice trailed off into gasps.  And for him, it seemed to be something so easy to say. He meant well, she knew, but words meant little to a worried mind. He attempted nothing more however, and she was thankful for that at least. Kind words were enough on his part. He could do no more harm than that she thought.  “I know—that I’ve done you wrong,” he said  “Don’t try to think about it,” she said again.  There was a subtle resignation on her eyes, as if to say that it was ok to be unwanted, that it was ok to have nothing.  Her words lilting like music in his ears, a single sentence but the pitch, the lilts and the cadences, the nuances of pronunciation made him then realized how it felt good to hear her speak.  But softness lacked the weight of any true resolve.  “I heard that you’re leaving. I just can’t –"  “Can’t what? I’ve been patient with you for too long. It’s time I let go,” she said.  “And what do you suggest I do then?” He finally asked.  He did not expect an answer from her, nor did she fall short of his expectations. Though it would’ve been nice if she had, he thought. If only her kind words could whisk away his problems and maybe a few of her own.  “You’ll be fine without me.” She said softly.  “All along the little lies invade the spaces between our relationship. We seem to get buried with every crashing doubt. I sink every time you make a fool out of me. And I guess now’s just the right time to end this. ” She added.  She looked intently at the direction of the  Polaris  still holding the now half-full bottle of beer. He noticed that she seemed well that night, her eyes twinkling with the sparkle they had had long before they were lovers.  For a brief fraction of a moment, she felt a renewed sense of focus on her being. She felt like an early seafarer, searching for stars for answers.  “I must go home.” Her voice playing in the wind, telling him that all was right as it should be in the world. So she walked past him leaving him alone on the edge of the shore.  As for him, the thought still lingered like a sickness, seeping into the cracks of his mind. She felt it too, he knew, but  not thinking about it  was best left as merely kind words, and nothing more.

        All of us have one of those days.   Some of us have one of those seasons.   Some even have one of those lives.   It feels like the world is chewing on us.   It isn't, it just feels that way. I have long realized that life isn't really what it is, it's what we think it is based on relative things and our knowledge level.  If you have traveled extensively, you know that in many parts of the world just clean drinking water is a rarity. We flush with clean drinking water.  So many of us have so much when you compare it.  Those of you that are reading this have access to the net, email, and acomputer.  You can see and you are not reading this from a hospital.  We have so much yet there is an innate tendency to complain.I tried to think of the easiest point in our lives to see if we complained then.  Babies have perhaps the easiest life around.Babies don't have to go to the toilet because mama changes their diapers. Mama breast feeds them, or gives them a bottle, rocks them to sleep, and lets them sleep as much as they want.  Babies go to bed when they want. Babies wake up when they want. Babies don't have to work. Babies don't have to deal with bills or bosses. Babies don't worry if their thighs have gotten too fat or if their hair is receding.  It's as easy as it gets.  With all of that, babies cry more.  Babies cry more, with all of that.  Maybe it's not circumstances, but the closer we are to babies (regardless of circumstances) the more we cry and complain.  I shall leave you with that thought.  Babies cry more.With all of that.

      I have to say, I love coffee.  I especially love it if it's the first thing I consume over the course of the day, and that love is most intense anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour or so after drinking it.  I love fresh, uber-dense coffee (with cream if I can get it!) in the mornings when I need to face my desk-in-the-corner-of-a-dark-office job. I love caramel machiattos in the evenings, when I need an after-work-before-losing-consciousness-writing boost. I love espressos in the afternoons.  Who needs a reason for those?!I don't think our coffee machine is going to make the transition over to Evil Corporation. Did I mention that I hate Evil Corporation? This is a Wolfram and Hart kind of Corporation. Squash the (as my grandpa would say) "little guy" to make a buck, it's fine by E.C. The "little guy" a member of the staff? Even better!  I'm going to get a coffee.  Is there such a thing as too much coffee? Only time will tell. Oh, and my Acid Reflux. It's pretty vocal about too much coffee.

      The door swung open making a sharp scrape on the polished wood floor. Mindless about the disturbance, the old maid entered my sleeping quarters, opened each curtain, allowing the morning light to quickly pour into the dim corners of my room.  Slowly my own corner of the world began to regain its color. Exposing the furniture my mom placed to spruce up her personal image of what she thought I was; fashionably conservative catholic girl.  My clothes were always scattered on the furniture. It reminded me of what mom always used to say, “Your room is a representation of your soul.”  If it were the case, then consider my soul at a tiny suffocating box strewn with sophisticated wooden antiquities, homey floral beddings and a picturesque oil renditions of unknown European landscapes, all draped under an unforgiving mess of clothing and useless memorabilia.  Reluctantly, I half-opened my eyes and felt the sun’s warmth resting on my pillow. For a moment, I thought the maid was wearing my clothes. But my vision was strangely blurry so I readily dismissed the absurd idea.  I hated waking up in my room, I thought lazily as my eyes started to drift closed.  The maid then purposely gathered my soiled clothes and left without a word. I then closed my eyes and sank back into deep slumber.  Sometime after dawn, I rolled over and saw the clock about to strike ten. Drifting in and out of sleep, my mind was trying to register that it was time to wake up.  As I tried to gain full consciousness, I felt the sheets brushing my breasts and my bare hips. Suddenly, my smile faded as I realized that I was naked. How odd since I don’t sleep in the nude.  “Is something wrong?” an unknown voice piped in.  Bewildered, I said “Nothing” in a faint, thready voice. To my discomfort, I clutched the sheet to my breasts as I struggled up against the pillows. It felt awkward to wake up stark naked.  I was alone in my room. The voice could’ve been just a figment of my imagination, animated by my slight intoxication.  I looked around for something to wear. With no luck, there was no clothing near me to grab. The maid took the entire garb she could possibly gather. I looked up and saw the closet. It had a mirror beside it. Then the next thing I knew, I was walking naked towards the closet  Almost halfway near the closet, I stopped and saw a reflection on the mirror. Instead of seeing myself standing bare naked, I stared in disbelief to see myself sleeping. My head resting on the fluffy pillow while my face was ghostly pale, but what struck me forcibly was how small I looked in that bed, swallowed up by pillows and bedcovers.  Small, frail and fragile.  I blinked again, and the image was still there. I set my eyes back to the closet door and suddenly there was this urgent rush for me to cover my nakedness. I ran quickly and grabbed the handle as I tried to open the closet.  It made my head pound horribly as I tried to open it.  “Hate…being…afraid,” I mumbled as I gave a strong, warm grip on the handle.  For some reason it depressed me. It was incongruous, but at that moment, not knowing who I was or where I had been or how I came to be here, the only thing that I did seem to know for certain was that I had to cover up. With all might I exhaust all my strength yet the closet remained closed.  Trembling in confusion, I was trapped.  Then I looked back, my sleeping image was still there, motionless and it seemed not to be breathing.  I then quickly returned my gaze back to the closet and saw something else. Something far more terrifying…  In front of me was a loaded 48-caliber revolver floating at midair.  A knot of fear made my chest ache as I watched the gun drifting near me. Its nozzle was pointing directly at my temple, ready to fire anytime.  I went stiff cold. Blood was pounding in my ears as I strained to hear the gun clicked. I finally recovered my power of speech.  “No!” My frantic scream was strangled as I heard another “click” from the gun’s revolver.  “Listen to me. Please have mercy!” I cried out, terrified by the sound.  “I don’t want to die. Let me go back!” I begged wildly. But it was too late and before I knew it…I heard gunshots.  Bang!...Bang!  Heavy smoke lingered in the air. For seconds, there was a miasma of sickening sadness floating around the room.  My head fell back limply and blood began to run from the back of my scalp. A low scream tore from my throat, then my gaze froze in terror on the sight of blood streaming on the pieces of broken mirror scattered across the floor. I crumpled to the floor, my shoulders racked in deep choking sobs.  “ Why won’t you listen to me?” The thought echoed through my mind, my body slowly turned into fog as I began to fade away…   The sky was streaked with a crimson sunset.  Tears slowly swelled from the corners of my eyes as I blankly stared at the ceiling above my bed. There was a shadowy void as dismal as my heart as I went over to the death scene with my invisible assassin.  I felt the sharp stab of anguish that shot through me.  Exhausted, I rolled onto my stomach. Despite the dull ache I began to remind myself to breathe. I picked up my pillow and wrapped my arms around it and hugged it to my chest, feeling every beat of my heart.  “It was just a nightmare.” I said softly.  I got up and went to the kitchen to get some water. Seated near the dinning table, was papa silently reading a book. He looked at me, acknowledging my presence and asked why I was awake.  “It’s three in the afternoon, aren’t you suppose to wake up at seven-thirty?” he asked.  “I woke up cause I thought I heard gunshots” I replied  “Gunshots? Could be just a dream, darling.” He said assumingly.  “Okay” I said numbly.  “Then get some rest afterwards, I’ll wake you up when its time.” He said.  Hesitantly I went back to bed. I realized that while the living world was doing about its business, I had died in my sleep. And maybe seven-thirty would be too late to make any difference.   -
