      July 14th. This is my first post. I read one of my friend's posts, and I had to get in on the action. Hopefully, whoever reads these will get a taste of all the immature, heinous, logical and un-pc things that float through my head at any given time. I'll even throw in the kitchen sink. My banter...if you will.  -Grizz

      August 13th. Sorry for the delay of my much anticipated return to the Wide World of Blog. I easily get side-tracked, which actually leads me to my point today. When I am at my desk in the office, I often times attempt to kill as much time as humanly possible without doing a shred of solid work. This usually leads me to surfing my favorite sites and refreshing my email every two minutes. As I continuously monitor my mail, I come across a world wide rave that is steadily becoming my biggest pet peeve. . .the dreaded FORWARD.  I know what you're thinking. How can something as innocent as receiving a forward be as drastically offensive as smacking your food or clipping your nails in public? Well, to be perfectly blunt, they just are. However, I will delve into the topic a little more in the attempt to help you understand my animosity towards a trend that is slowly killing me.  The first type of forward I would like to discuss is the "Cheap Ass" Forward. This is the email that you receive, along with nine other people, stating that the sender forwarded this to ten people in order to receive a coupon to The Gap, a year of free gas or something else that is grotesquely absurd. The "Cheap Ass" forward is particularly painful because the sender has a tendency to actually know what he or she is actually doing. I know this because there is usually some short blanket text that reads, "I was just seeing if this works." Well, first off, see if works on some other person, douchebag! Secondly, why don't you just write what you really mean? For instance, just write, "I am a cheap mother fucker, and I was hoping, by some miracle, that by taking these few precious seconds of your life away, a buy-one-get-one-free coupon to my neighbor's garage sale would pop up on my computer screen." These tightwad forwards must be stopped, and I must stop talking about them because I feel like I'm gonna projectile vomit.  Another type of forward I want to address is slowly becoming the the most notorious of all forwards, and I am estimating that it may actually be the sole contributor to the downfall of society as we know it. I like to label this type of forward the "Moral Nutjob." I had to label it rather generically because I have found that this type of email actually encompasses more than just fanatical religious text. They also include any email that would make you question your moral or religious beliefs if you don't forward it BACK to the person who sent it, PLUS ten other people. Please don't misinterpret me, I am religious and have moral convictions; however, these emails cannot be tolerated. For instance, Little Timmy writes all of his friends, and explains his story. It is a gut-wrenching autobiography about how he was born with no skeletal system and looks like an amoeba, or Jabba the Hut. He continues to explain that if everyone forwards this to everyone they know, he'll get the bones he always wanted. Can someone honestly explain how Little Timmy is gonna get a new fucking spine if I email this to ten people I know? Please! Anyone? The worst part about these emails is the fact that you DO have to email the sender back. This way, the sender can keep tabs and spread wildly ficticious rumors about you behind your back. I can hear them now saying, "Man, Grizz is going to hell. I sent him an email about Jesus and he didn't send it back. I think he hates us." Or, "Man. Grizz is such a prick. I sent him an email about a kid that looks like The Blob, and he didn't respond!" So now the people know me. I am going to hell, and I am an asshole to small children without bones. But, as I mentioned, I have moral convictions, so this what I'm gonna do. My spine is close to perfect, so Little Timmy can have it...WHEN I'M IN HELL!  Ugh, forwards. I need a shower. -Grizz
