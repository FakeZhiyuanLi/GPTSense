      So today was our RE presentation, we had put in lots of effort and were all ready. The lights when out, we shined the spotlights on our presenter, the screen went down... then all of a sudden, the projector turned off (broke down) ! wonder of wonders... aft 6 succesful presentations the projector had decided to sabo us. Down to the main point, i think it was all dalai's fault. he used his jinx powers on us, his own group. But even without our slides, we continued. Though we actually cut more than 1/3 of the presentation and presented the rest rather jitterily. But the worst part was definitely that just after we concluded (as in literally, 2 seconds), the projector went on! *sigh* sadness rite? but wat is passed will never come back we arent goin to get another chance, so who cares. Anyway ferdi said to me that he liked our slides when he saw them later, so i guess it will be quite ok.  rite after that was hockey, bull had just found out about the shirts thing... so he screwed us. But i'm getting quite used to this kinda thing now, i even managed to find some humor in the way he was screwing us! i had to stifle my laughter ever so often. yeah, i guess i'm turning looney, yay!

      A few dayz on and I’m losing interest in “my blog”. Haha. School really sucked today, as usual. Anyway zhang mei suo was giving problem again. Its like he planned the test for next Thursday and told us like beginning of last week. Then today, he found out that we are going to be at a camp on Thursday and just changed it to Monday like “that”. Its like no freaking time to study. And I need the time cos I take real long to study. Anyways that started me thinking again > my life is ¼ over, and I haven’t accomplished anything!!! And wat am I doing now??? I’m studying and putting myself through all the trouble of passing exams… and that is useless to me. I wanna be a superstar roadsweeper! So what is the use of studying Chinese? Math? Science? Its just soo exasperating! I dun get to make my own choices, why cant I choose a roadsweeper course and spend my school life slacking like they do in austrailia??? In austrailia the first “graded” test is held when the kids are 18 years old! And that is obviously beneficial to the kids… take ri geps for example, the crème de la crème or what ever… of the singaporean students. They take so freaking many test, they are “smart” . But they are all so freaking weird, “vegetable brains” trained to memorize rubbish. Oh yah they are also so cocked up and all! And the moe doesn’t see all this, cos they are made out of this kinda people too! So what do people with different aspirations do? ---- to be continued.

      Man, I am in trouble again. The t-shirt stealing thing has only recently concluded and I appear once again on the wrong side of law. Mr koh is already really pissed with me, and now some one told him that I threatened aaron about some history test thingy!!! That’s soo non-existent. I hope I can resolve this one quickly without getting into any further trouble. If u happen to be the one who told mr koh or maybe you told someone who could have told mr koh, please contact me cause you have made a mistake. Oh yah, if anyone knows who told mr chow about my selling food in class thing please contact me asap. I really wish ri boys had more integrity than this, if a class mate cannot put his trust in you… who can?

      This is my first blog and my first post and i'm doing it on friday 13th! How jinxed is that...  Anyway, today was our hockey third and fourth placing. So we were dismissed early and met in the canteen, most people weren’t too serious, but i sure wasn’t anyway... i'll tell you why later. anyways after warm up we got onto the pitch we played around for awhile. Finally the refs walked to the center of the pitch and the coin was tossed and stuff, the whistle blew. the game had begun, the first half was pretty uneventful though, i got a reverse chop which was on target, but sadly it flew out, besides that the game was pretty even. Second half i picked up my pace, making a few nice dribbles and centering the ball once, then toward the middle of the second half i dribbled past a defender into the D and got a short corner.i dragpushed the ball to chun men who stopped it smoothly and sent me a nice pass to the top D. i took a first timer... the ball hit the goalkeepers pads and went in with a resounding "bang". i was filled with joy, bursting with it perhaps, but this wasn’t it, this was not how i used to feel when we won.  This was my first 3rd 4th placing ever, i had always had the good fortune of being in the finals. So why was that not the case this time round? Firstly, of the entire team of 19, 12 were sec1 and only 7 were sec2, in the first team of 11, 7 were sec1 and only 4 were sec2! for the last two years there have only been 1 or 2 sec1s in the first team! I’d like to congratulate all you sec1s though and I think you guyz played well, it wasn’t your fault that we lost, it was your first major tournament and you guyz were visibly nervous, but it was not your fault. I feel that it was bulls fault. last year he neglected the sec1s causing many to drop out so we had to use many sec1s this year. So very frankly we were weak, people should not have expected us to win anything with our team, infact I was pretty amazed that we managed to make it this far. I’d like to point out that it hurts alot when people say "you are the captain of the first hockey team in seven years to not take the championship title". Hopefully after reading this you have realized that it was not my fault and that the team has actually done "well" I mean, next years team is going to be like really strong… if you know I’m talking about you, feel regretful now. Cos I have given my f******g best and it is none of ur f******g buisness, beat it.  As I was saying the 3rd 4th did not matter much to me,  people only remember the best and the lousiest , so I feel that between 3rd and 4th, there is no diff.
