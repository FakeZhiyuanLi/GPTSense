      well.. today's sunday so i went to church as usual in the morning.. and one thing i can say abt church is.. the sound room is totally rad! yeahh.. i lurve being in the sound room.. cos i'm high up and everyone's below me.. gives me a sense of satisfaction somehow.. but well of course, the ultimate purpose is still to serve God and not to bother whether the sound room gives me a sense of satisfaction or not.. hehhs.//. hrr.. so damn pissed off with two people today.. first is him and second is.. well 'you-know-who'.. hehhs.//. i'm looking forward to seeing him later tonight.. today is the 22nd again.. but nothing special so far.. so depressing ain't it? +moodless+  propaganda signing off...
