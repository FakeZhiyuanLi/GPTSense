      Why is it so damned important for people to know if someone has a website or not? If I wanted ya to know I would tell ya. For now, I am trying to figure out how to attach pictures to this stupid page and I might as well be stuck in the middle of a blond joke.  And until I have this blog up and running properly, NO ONE IS GETTING THE ADDRESS!  Feck off.

      So this idiot I work with is from Northern Ireland. He hasn't been home in nine years. And he blames the British for everything from the AIDS epidemic to Iraq ( How he figured out that one remains beyond me...).  So England lost to France on Sunday in the Euro Cup and a bunch of the English fans came into the bar. To this dipshit's credit, some of them were real bonafide wankers. But not all of them.  I just didnt understand the sheer hatred this waiter had for the English. Until I heard him saying, "I am not serving those Brit wankers on the patio," in front of them. So it really made me laugh when two of them said they werent English and wouldnt support the English if their lives depended on it. So i asked them where they were from... "I'm from Scotland," says one guy. "I'm from Wales," says the other. They were just watching the game because they love soccer.  And this northern Irish dipshit had to go stirring up all sorts of trouble...Fan-fucking-tastic.  That plus an old guy named Don came into the bar and told me I as a real looker ...And i thought what he said was I was a great hooker...I almost choked on my sip of coffee...Great Weekend. Really.

        Hey! ok so here's some small facts about me. Im Irish, born and raised in Limerick. I love heineken but shouldnt drink it... But since I left Ireland, I love hot weather. So DC summers are pretty awesome for me...if only there was a beach... I love my puppy Bandit (pictures are soon to follow of the cutest Jack Russell on the planet). I love old things and old places....which is good since I'm studying archaeology...I'm addicted to text messaging...I love the food channel...this is getting more random... I love Mexican food. I love learning about new cultures and travelling to new places. I think soccer men are HOT! And even though Robert Redford is not long for this world, he's still the sexiest man alive!    Hmmmmmm...so that's basically me in a small peanut nutshell...and until i get the hang of this blogging thing, I'm just gonna blather on and on. Peace out- hehehehe....

      So I'm headed to the hottest point on the planet...Yuma, Arizona. My brother is in trouble for this: disobeying a direct order to take a medication for tuberculosis (which he doesnt have) and so the 'Larkins' are going to take on Yuma. Ugh! I am soooo tired of having to explain whats going on...Anyways, i wish i wish upon a star everything turns out ok.

      This dude came to my front door at 10am this morning and wanted to know where he should drop pf the rocks. "What rocks?" says I, with sleep crust in my eyes. (Out of the corner of my eye i can see bandit flying through the air in both directions.) "The box of rocks sitting in my truck for this apartment," he says. (Well I suppose at this point I should have been glad that he didnt just walk into the apt like the flower delivery guy). "Um, I think you must have the wrong address. What kind of rocks are they?" Now here was where the "sleepy me" turned into the "psycho archaeology me" and actually thought they might have been important rocks sent from maybe France for me to look at! Not a chance. "They're just a bunch of plain old rocks,"says the lil man with the pony tail. "Lemme get my paperwork and I'll be right back." Sure enough those rocks were for my apt. Turns out the delivery man was supposed to drop them off to a bunch of mexican workers outside my apt. For what? I dunno. Maybe they are going to make my apt bigger. Or maybe they're gonna pave the newly cemented sidewalk with them. To be honest I dont care. They're not my type of rocks anyhoos. http://img.villagephotos.com/p/2004-8/803660/boxrocks.gif

      The bar has had no food for over a week now and will have no food til next week when the kitchen reopens. This means that we are closed during the day and open in the evenings for cold sandwiches and a full bar. What this also means is i am almost broke. Not too fun. But hey! at least i got in 5 hours of TIPS training on monday. This was a class that we all had to attend in order to be able to prevent and deal with drunk people. Responsible publicans. One thing i never knew was that carbonated mixers allow alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream faster. Hmmmmm. Interesting.  On other interesting notes, my parents are sailing the carribean right now. They missed their flight to san juan originally but managed to pay a small fortune to catch a later flight. Im sure blackberry brandy and red wine had nuthin to do with that one.
