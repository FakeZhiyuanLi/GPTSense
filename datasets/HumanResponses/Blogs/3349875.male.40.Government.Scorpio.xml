      I play this online game...Ultima Online. And it's great fun; at times.  Sometimes, however, it really makes me wanna scream. Like today. I wasn't really thinking of playing seriously at all today, but I thought I might. So I took my Mage character out and about. Started off fine, then I died.   Now Ultima will let you resurrect when you die, so I did (with consequent loss of Fame). Went back to retrieve my stuff from my soon to be rotting corpse and after doing that thought "Just one more go!"  You guessed it...died again; more Fame loss. Resurrect, get my stuff...yes, "Just one more go!"  Just one more death. Now we are at screaming point! More Fame I had worked hard to achieve down the drain. Ah well, I suppose I'll be back. Glutton for punishment.  I hate that game! Ha! Ha! Ha!  Dave

      I only just figured out how to get the time zone right on this thing. Now at least I can publish and use it as an alibi!!  Dave

      It's happened!!  I now have 1Mb conn! Of course there are plenty of companies that will do more for less mazullah but it's a start. I am only tied to BT for another 3 months now the regrade has been done, so I can migrate if I like after then.  Of course because of all the problems I had with spam, all my email now comes via BT so I would have to change my email and tell everyone again. That puts me off slightly but, having said that, an even faster conn and less money is likely to persuade.   I would have to cancel this ISP though and be without for a while, which I am not prepared to do at the moment because I need my connection; and I just set sub accounts for the wife and daughter which would have to change along with the parental control stuff. So, it would be a bit  of a trial. But time will tell.  Dave

      Why is it when you want something done by a large company, they always seem to mess it up. Their administration, which you would think would be tried and tested (after all they wouldn't be so big if it wasn't rock solid now would they) fails at seemingly every turn.  My recent attempts at upgrading my ADSL connection to 1Mb have been met with this form of "don't know their arse from their elbow" style or customer service to the point I wouldn't trust them (them is British Telecom/Yahoo) to sit the right way round on a toilet seat!! Three times they have failed because they cannot complete an order correctly at the orders department. I know, I know that's only their goddamned  job  ain't it?  Now set once more for the 21st May, I know it's going to fail again. I must do something to give them a kick up the ass...hmmm...thinks...I know, I'll phone them for a  fifth  time. Keep your fingers crossed eh!  Dave

      ...as this is the first post to something I have never done before, I should explain the title;  Only Echoes . Other than the fact that it is part of a line in an  Ultravox!  song (Hiroshima Mon Amour), it kind of represents what this is about; echoes of what I am doing and thinking.  How often I get to post to this is something I cannot predict. I am in the middle of a Computing degree and working full time, so time is short. It's also coming from Scotland so expect opinions from that perspective.   It's actually hard to know what to write to something like this but it will get better or more interesting as I get accustomed to it...and once I think of something to say. Maybe next post I'll say a little of who I am; that might be fun!
