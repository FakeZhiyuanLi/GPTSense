      but just in case you do, hail McSweeny's!   urlLink http://www.mcsweeneys.net/links/bush/   c'mon, people.  let's put the US back on track to being an enlightened society, a beacon of intellect and democracy and freedom and all those other things we like to say about ourselves on national holidays.  and mondays.  and, um, all those other days we're real proud to be 'murican.  let's all stand up together and vote the idiot and his crew of scum and villainy out of office, ok?   Yep, MNF is about to get political.  Don't worry.  That won't be all I do here.  But I will be leaning towards politics more and more as the year goes on.

      In these troubling times it's important to have something to believe  in.  Normally, this is where I'd say "I believe I'll have another  beer."  But instead I'll point you in the direction of  urlLink Belief-O-Matic , which will tell you its opinion  of the religion that most closely matches your beliefs based on your  answers to some pretty heavy questions.  Interestingly, I turn out to be more Jehovah' Witness than Orthodox  Jew.  I'm neither, so I guess that's ok.  I'm just shocked that UU beat  out SH by 1%.  Good thing I got married at a UU church, eh?  Here's my breakdown...  1. Unitarian Universalism  (100%) 2. Secular Humanism  (99%) 3. Liberal Quakers  (91%) 4. Neo-Pagan  (83%) 5. Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants  (81%) 6. Theravada Buddhism  (76%) 7. Nontheist  (66%) 8. New Age  (65%) 9. Mahayana Buddhism  (62%) 10. Taoism  (56%) 11. Reform Judaism  (56%) 12. Orthodox Quaker  (54%) 13. Sikhism  (54%) 14. Jainism  (51%) 15. Bahá'í Faith  (50%) 16.

      It's not the most original phrase in the world (damn you, Zeldman) but  it is true today:  I am a happy cog.  There is nothing about my job that will break my serenity.  It is the  serenity of the utterly doomed.  And, since I have accepted this doom,  I can go quietly and without anger through the rest of my day here.  Repeat after me:  I am a happy cog.

      It appears to have been an eventful weekend.  I will refrain from comment on nearly all of it.  Because even though certain newly deceased ex-presidents were no heroes in my home, I was raised not to speak ill of the dead.  So rest in peace and all that.

       urlLink The Labor Department says there are new jobs!   But they don't mention whether we're talking ditch-digging and prostitution or real jobs, like selling apples on the corner.  Oh well, as long as we're all employed somehow I guess we have to vote for the incumbent, right?
