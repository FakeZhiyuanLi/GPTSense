      Assignment:  What is your "technological history"? What are your earliest memories of technology? Computers or video games or the vibrating bouncy-chair that cuddled you as a baby? What of Teddi Ruxpin? the Speak and Spell? or the See-and-Say? When did you use your first computer? What was it like? What did you do with it? What fears or phobias do you have regarding technology? computers? How does your computer function in your day-to-day life? How would your life be different without your computer? e-mail and the Internet? What would be more difficult about being a student if you didn't have computers/Internet? What would be easier?   Response:       My technology history started when I was 4.  I had this machine that looked a lot like a mini-computer, complete with a working keyboard.  On the side was a space for diskettes, and each diskette offered a game to teach me math, spelling, shapes, and U.S. states.  I don’t remember what it was called, but I loved it.  I carried it everywhere.  The constant blurps and beeps must have driven my parents crazy, but they never said so.  By the time I entered kindergarten, I could read books, identify every U.S. state, and solve basic addition problems (provided I could use my fingers and, if necessary, toes).  I also had exposure to the cutting-edge technology known as Lite-Brite.  For some reason, in my early childhood, multi-colored pegs that would light up at my discretion fascinated me.     .       In second and third grade, we spent about an hour every day in the computer lab with Ms. Clark, the computer teacher.  Ms. Clark was cross-eyed and she frightened me, but I did enjoy using the computer.  We played with a program called Logo on Apple IIE computers with green screens.  We learned how to manipulate and control the movements of a turtle on the screen, through a series of typed commands.  It was in this lab that I had my first experience with a game called “Oregon Trail.”    .  Ah, the joys of packing my 19th Century wife and kids into a covered wagon and heading out into the wild frontier, hunting for wild game, and bartering my valuables in exchange for supplies, only to have every wheel on my covered wagon break and each member of my family drop off like flies from drowning, dysentery, or diphtheria.  I enjoyed it immensely.      Around third grade, I got my first Nintendo, and Oregon Trail and other Apple computer games took a backseat for several years.  After Nintendo came Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Sony Playstation, and Nintendo 64.  I loved video games.  What’s interesting to me is that I almost completely abandoned computers in favor of video games; now I’ve almost completely abandoned video games in favor of computers.      In high school, I took a class called Computer Math.  I learned how to use the programs Basic and C++.  I began going to the public library to type papers for English classes, and while I was there, began surfing the Internet for the first time.  I was fourteen.  Although I’d had an old Apple computer at home since I turned eight, my family didn’t get online at home until after I had graduated high school.  By that time, I already had an email address, basic knowledge of how to use a search engine, and a few favorite websites.        When I came to college, I bought my own computer and had a constant Ethernet connection.  I began IM’ing people through AOL Instant Messenger, downloading music illegally, and using the Internet for school (I even took an online course).  Having my own computer definitely exposed me to the most technology at one time that I had previously been exposed to.  For most of my freshman year, if I wasn’t eating, sleeping, studying, or going out with friends, I was online in some capacity—checking my email, talking to people, surfing, or downloading.        I think I’ve actually become dependent on my computer.  As soon as I get home from anywhere, my instinctive reaction is to immediately go to my computer and check my regular sites.  Without a computer in my room, I would be lost. I rely on it for so much.  I compose most papers sitting at my computer, rarely handwriting anything first anymore.  I have several friends with which I only communicate via email or IM.  I don’t use it so much that I leave no time for reading books, going out, working, or exercising.  But it is definitely a major part of my life.        I think it would be difficult to be a student at ECU without my own computer.  I can’t imagine having to go to the library or a computer lab on campus every time I needed to look up something.  I have learned a lot from computers and I think my time online has been more valuable than wasted.

      What follows is a rhetorical précis I wrote in response to this  urlLink article .  In their essay “Public:  Take Our Privacy Please” (2001), Declan McCullagh and Ryan Sager claim that, according to polls, a vast majority of the American public does not seem to be concerned with Internet privacy.   The authors support this claim by offering data drawn from these polls, which says that while most Americans are apprehensive to reveal personal information like Social Security numbers, financial and medical information, or information about their children, most feel comfortable supplying their gender, age, education, occupation, hobbies, and interests.  The authors discuss possible future privacy legislation in order to persuade readers to think about Internet privacy and the possibility of it becoming a major issue.  The authors have an informal relationship with their audience and they present this information to readers who may not consider online privacy to be a big deal.  Personally I fall in line with that sixteen percent that is not very concerned about Internet privacy.  I agree with Humphrey Taylor’s description of privacy as a “landmine issue.”  Issues that could personally affect someone online don’t really receive a lot of attention until negative media coverage or a bad personal experience make the issue relevant to Internet users.  I have bought things online, supplied my phone number and address to online forms, and provided information about my hobbies, interests, occupation, residence, and age in personal profiles I have made for various sites.  Privacy hasn’t been a huge issue for me because I haven’t personally encountered any negative consequences of “telling too much.”  I have read articles about Spy Ware and identity theft, but I have a limit when it comes to how much information I am willing to share online, and common sense should be the tool used to decide where to draw the line.  Most Internet users don’t view the Internet as a similar phenomenon to Foucault’s panopticon, with the guard in the tower being replaced by Big Brother, with the ability to look out at “prisoners” and observe their activities.  Anyone with the time and energy to devote to hacking could potentially access and corrupt our personal information, but most Americans seem either oblivious or indifferent to such possible surveillance and supervision.  Legislation in America is all too often retroactive rather than preventative.  Violation of privacy may need to become widespread or high profile before Congress decides to deal with this issue.

      Here is a  urlLink link  to this assignment (Discovery Writing #2)  As a student, I am automatically a part of certain groups.  I am a student in the school of communication, and in each of my classes, I am a member of a group.  I work constantly with my co-workers at Panera Bread.  I am also a member of my family group, and a part of my group of friends. My family and friends are clearly Gemeinschaft-type communities.  My relationships with my friends and family are stable and long-lasting.  I know all my friends and family and I help them; they, in turn, know and help me.  My family has been with me all of my life, my friends for a large part.  My family is definitely normative, traditionally composed of a mother, father, and younger sibling, all of whom I get along with very well.  I have a similar relationship with my friends.  Although I have grown apart or lost contact with a few former friends, I have a core group of close friends that I have tight bonds with. I also have relationships, although less constant and stable, with members of certain Gesellschaft-type groups I am a part of.  Within the school of communication and within each of my classes, I may work closely with my classmates and learn all their names, but unlike the Gemeinschaft-type communities, these relationships do not have multiple bonds; they are one-dimensional.  The relationships I have with people in my classes and with people in the school of communication are purely functional.  We are simply students working together and interacting with one another.  For a fellow student to become a member of my Gemeinschaft-type community of friends, I would need to spend time with that person outside of class and cultivate a deeper relationship based on more common interests. At my job, people I work with are part of a Gemeinschaft community.  I work alongside them regularly and we talk about many different things.  Many people see each other socially outside of work and many of them have become good friends.  Simultaneously at work though, a Gesellschaft-type relationship exists between the customers and my co-workers and me.  Our job as employees is to deliver friendly service and quality product.  Although we greet each customer and may have a short conversation with them, these are sporadic encounters, since we may go weeks without seeing the same customer twice.  This relationship is shallow and instrumental. I think the concept of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft communities can apply to the Net also.  I have a group of friends that I regularly email and talk to on AOL Instant Messenger.  Although it is a stretch to call this "face-to-face interaction," many other Gemeinschaft characteristics are present.  Many people within my online community of email and IM know not only me, but also each other.  I regularly keep in touch with these people, so the relationships are stable and long-lasting.  Cyberspace serves as a tool to connect us with friends we might have weaker links to, were it not for the technology that allows us to stay in touch.   Online, I am a member of a few Gesellschaft communities also.  I often post messages on the Onestop forums when I am selling something, looking for advice about a professor, or requesting some other type of information.  Any responses I receive are purely functional, serving the purpose of giving me the information I need.  While I don't typically join chat rooms, I believe these also fall under the Gesellschaft category.  Small talk between two people who don't know each other is quite shallow--often something to do to pass the time.  They may be discussing similar beliefs or interests, but strong interpersonal communication is non-existent. There are a couple of communities that I am not a part of, but yet I find them interesting.  I hear a lot about how people that live on College Hill become really close friends.  During my freshman year, I lived on west campus and since then, I have stayed in an apartment.  Although I have several close friends, I sometimes regret not living on College Hill to experience that type of closeness.  I also have a strong desire to be a part of the volunteer community.  I am trying to find the time to regularly volunteer through United Way of Greenville.  I have done some volunteer work before, and I crave the closeness that I know can come with helping people and working with other volunteers. I think a major difference between Gesellschaft and Gemeinschaft communities is voluntary versus involuntary participation.  In Gemeinschaft communities, I have the power to choose which relationships I want to cultivate into long-lasting bonds.  I often form Gesellshaft relationships out of necessity, in order to functionally interact with other members of such groups.

      This précis is in response to this  urlLink story   R. U. Sirius and St. Jude, in their essay “The Medium is the Message and the Message is Voyeurism” (1994), argue that American citizens have become obsessed with getting their “fifteen minutes of fame” by putting their lives on display and with taking part in “armchair lynching.”  The teledemocratic view expressed in this piece seems to suggest that Americans are no longer “We the People,” but rather “We the Television People.”  The authors support this argument by offering television examples such as  popular sensationalized news and court programs (Dateline NBC and Court TV), talk shows (Oprah and Donahue), and crime shows (Cops and America’s Most Wanted), which reflect the current trend of Americans enjoying media voyeurism and exhibitionism.  Their purpose is to call attention to this trend in order to encourage readers to ponder both the causes and possible consequences of such television viewing behavior.  Their audience is anyone who is not aware of this voyeuristic trend and the authors explain the topic clearly, offering many examples to sway the audience and bring attention to this growing problem.  What’s startling about this piece is that it was written over ten years ago and yet it is still true today.  This voyeuristic media obsession had grown.  The Jerry Springer Show became immensely popular in the mid- to late-90s, with audiences tuning in to see what bizarre fetishes exist in the world of trailer trash, and whose bitch slept with which skank.  In the modern world of “infotainment,” news channels have grown also, with MSNBC, FOX News, and CNN Headline News, to name a few, each offering as much footage as our greedy eyes can feast upon.  And shows like Real TV, World’s Scariest Police Chases, and Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, give Americans glimpses into the crazy stunts, antics, and strange talents of anyone that happened to be caught on tape showing off.  Clearly, this article is not dated; the voyeuristic media frenzy that had started over a decade ago is now out of control.

      The following is a précis I wrote in response to a  urlLink story  about educational video games.  In his essay “Play Games, Be Better Students? (2004),” Daniel Terdiman asserts that it may be possible to use video games to improve American education.  He supports this idea by providing suggestions from video game insiders and designers and evidence of the high sales of educational games in recent years.  The author’s purposes are to make readers aware that many educators and game designers are actively trying to make the mainstreaming of educational games a reality and to convince any skeptics that these games may in fact be helpful.  He establishes an informal relationship with his audience of skeptics, by writing a piece that is short, to the point, and easy to read.             This idea to educate with video games has its advantages and disadvantages.  Teenagers already spend too much time playing video games, sitting motionless in front of television screens, in a vegetative state, thumbs blistered.  Unfortunately, most students, when given the choice of an action-packed sports or military/spy game and educational game, will choose the one of the former.  Most teenagers would be turned off to the idea of playing such a game before even giving it a chance, simply because it is presented as educational.               On the other hand, I believe that, if implemented properly, these games can be beneficial.  While I don’t have much experience with educational games, I have played many word games online, on sites like Pogo, Yahoo!, and MSN, and I’ve expanded my vocabulary a little through playing them.  I believe that games that have a message—games that teach students information they may actually retain in the form of new knowledge—can be a highly effective tool in America’s classrooms, but I think it would take a large group of game designers, parents, teachers, administrators, and lawmakers coming to a consensus agreeing on what types of games should be offered, the amount of time that should be allotted for playing these games during class time, and how these educational games should be supplemented with other material.  Since such a large-scale effort is necessary, and since one of the sources in Terdiman’s piece says that she has been trying to get educational games to work for almost thirty years, I think that the established forms of education can be thoroughly effective if they are exercised properly.           Americans under the age of eighteen, for example, read far less that they used to.  In an age of IPODs, chat rooms, and search engines, books are becoming a dying form of entertainment and learning.  I think back on books that I have read and even the mediocre ones have taught me more and engaged my thinking more than any game I have played.  Stories and lessons that used to be taught to students exclusively (and effectively) by both parents and instructors are being replaced by technological sources.  Television, which is shaping children’s ideas about the world now more than ever, has become the interim parent while the real parents are busy.  Internet courses, which have gained popularity over the last decade, have eliminated the need for personal instructor-student interaction.  The Internet has made our lives much more convenience-oriented and it serves its purpose to make many aspects of our lives easier.  But in the field of education, I don’t believe technology should take the place of books, teachers, and classrooms.  These games can be used to supplement existing effective teaching practices, not to replace them.

           So I just downloaded this program called Limewire.  It's a file-sharing program.  I stopped using Kazaa about three or four months ago because I got tired of half of the files I downloaded being incomplete or bad quality and also because I started listening to music on my Launchcast radio station on Yahoo (which I highly recommend).  But anyway, my Advanced Comp professor actually told me about Limewire.  I tried it and I love it.  You can modify the searches to automatically filter out bad files and files from computers that have connections slower than cable or DSL.  And songs that used to take 15-20 minutes on my computer with Kazaa take less than a minute with Limewire.  I'm very pleased.  Let's just hope the RIAA doesn't sue me.       I'm hungry.  I'm really craving good Japanese steakhouse food...the kind they cook in front of you.  We have a pretty good place here in Greenville...Zappara or something like that.  I should go back there.        Speaking of food, work is going well.  I work at Panera Bread.      I've worked about 6 or 7 days so far.  Everyone is really cool and I don't mind working with food because the food looks and tastes so good, so I can actually be proud of the food I'm selling, which makes it not as bad as other places I have worked (Pizza Hut...McDonald's...cough cough).  And everyone there is super nice.  I think I will work at Panera a really long time.  Oh...and Panera is Spanish for "breadbasket"...just in case you were wondering like I was for a while.      I'm moving into a new apartment in August.  I can't wait.  I've lived in a four-bedroom apartment for two years now and I'm so tired of it.  Every room in my current apartment is so small and I just look around and think "blah."  I'm ready for a change.  My new apartment will be brand new...huge...only two bedrooms...really nice.  www.riverpointevillage.com      Ok, I think I'm finished with my novella.  That's enough for now.  By the way, feel free to say hey anytime.  AIM: adamatecu Email:  ecuadam2003@yahoo.com

      I had to make a blog to post my papers and thoughts on for an English class I'm taking this summer, and I liked this site so much, I've decided to make a personal blog of my own. I'll be posting things that happen, sites or pictures I think are funny, current favorites (songs, movies, books, bands, etc.), thoughts, plans, and ramblings. So read as much or as little as you want and feel free to comment. Welcome.

      So I went to the Financial Aid office today to find out why I haven't gotten my check for living expenses yet.  The lady told me that the particular loan I received is disbursed in installments and that the rest won't be here until June 4th.  Which really sucks, because I'm broke now.  I just got a check from Panera but it was only for 3 hours since I went home for a week.  So it looks like I have a week and a half of little or no money.  Fun.    But I'm not gonna let it get me down.  The weather is nice.  I have an awesome girlfriend, a cabinet full of food, a great job, and classes I like.   Today I went ahead and signed up for two more classes.  I was only planning on taking classes during the first summer session, but I decided that, since I will be here working for the whole month of July, I might as well take a couple more courses I need for the second summer session.  That way, I can get some additional financial aid too.  I'm considering double majoring in Comm and English, instead of just having English as my minor.  That might require me to go to ECU an additional semester though, so I don't know.    So here's a few things I like:  (Random, I know)  --Cold sheets in the summer --Big puffy clouds --Sleeping in Saturdays --When it storms and rains really hard --Plain cheese pizza...extra cheese --Reading an awesome book...one you can't put down --Sittin' around in my favorite pair of jeans --Watching someone open a gift from me --Unexpected gifts   for   me --Chocolate milkshakes --Home cooking --Hearing from someone I haven't heard from in a while  Everyone should read the essay "Self-Reliance" by Ralph Waldo Emerson.  I read it recently and I really like it.  Anyway, time to go do some homework.

      Amanda (my girlfriend) has a  urlLink list of things  she wants to do during her lifetime, so I decided to make a list of my own.  Some of these aren't necessarily "life goals," but rather things I want to do relatively soon or habits I want to form.  It will more than likely be up to no one other than me to get these done, but I just thought I would share with whoever wants to know.  So here it is...  I want to:  --Hike the entire Appalachian Trail, all 2,160 miles of it at one time...from Georgia to Maine.  --Serve a full term of service in the Peace Corps.  --Hold a baby.  (Yes, I've done it before, but not in an incredibly long time.)  --Buy or borrow a trombone and start playing it again.  --Go skydiving.  --Save someone's life.  --Get in touch with old friends that I haven't talked to in a few years.  --See the Northern Lights.  --Start recycling regularly.  --Go white-water rafting. (No, I've never been.)  --Drive a motorcycle.  --See the rainforest.  --Play a full round of golf at any golf course.  --Spend one New Years' Eve in Times Square.  --Radically change (for the better) the life of a stranger.  --Learn to play guitar well.  --Ride a horse.  (Done it before, but it's been about 8 years.)  --Ride a train.  --Plant a tree.  --Receive postcards from as many countries as possible.  --Take a canoe, rowboat, or sailboat out onto a lake by myself for a day.  --Be a role model or mentor to someone.  --Marry someone I can't live without.  --See a Broadway play or musical.  --See a movie at a drive-in.  --Visit Greece.  --Look up words I don't know and try to use them.  --Spend 6 months to a year doing volunteer work.  --Write a book.  --See Europe...at least parts of it.  --See a whale in the wild.  --Write a song.  --Always have a book that I am in the process of reading in my spare time.  --Adopt a child.   While I'm in list-making mode, my birthday is August 12th.  So here's what I want...  --"Crack the Case" board game (very hard to find)  --"Tales of the Resistance/Kingdom/Reformation" (3 different books, but I will be happy with just one) by David and Karen Mains (also very hard to find)  --A case for my camera  --Gift certificates to anywhere that has cool stuff for my new apartment (Pier 1...Target...Bed, Bath, & Beyond...etc.)  --More memory for my computer  --"Angry White Men" by Michael Moore (paperback is fine...and cheaper)   I'm sure both of these lists will be updated in the near future, so keep checking back :)  I hope at least some of this was interesting to read...

      So on Friday afternoon, right after I get out of class, I get to enjoy the wonderfully scenic and interesting drive home on I-40 (insert sarcasm here).  Today, I have to get 4, yes count 'em, 4 new tires put on my car.  Oh, and I get to do laundry and pack too.  And work tonight.  Awesome.  But it's worth it.  Because on Friday and Saturday, I'm going with my girlfriend to a barbecue festival in Tryon.  I've never been.  I'm told they have many different styles of barbecue from all over the country.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  So we're gonna stop off on the way home and meet Amanda's dad, Janice, and her sisters there.  And then on Saturday, we get to go back with her mom and some of her mom's friends/exes.  I'm really excited about it.  The  urlLink Blue Ridge Barbecue Festival  has bands playing on two stages all day and fireworks at night.  I think it will be a lot of fun.  I was scheduled on Saturday, so it didn't look like I would be able to go home.  But after begging just about everyone at Panera to fill in for me, I noticed that there were six people scheduled to close Saturday instead of the normal five.  So I went in and talked to Saturday's manager Bert (who is my new favorite manager) and he agreed to let me have the day off.  Which is awesome because Amanda's family is so anxious to see her, and going to the BBQ Festival together is something of a tradition for them.  I'm also excited because my family has no idea I am coming home and hopefully I can convince them to come to the BBQ festival with me.  I guess this could ruin the surprise but I don't think anyone in my family regularly checks for blog updates unless I tell them to.  It's really hot today.  I like the weather though.  It makes me want to go swimming.  If only I weren't as pale as a dehydrated ghost.  Oh well.  I'll cool off some other way.  Mmmmm...lemonade.  There's a thought.  Ok, I'm retarded.  Anyway...Amanda and I watched  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  last night.  I really like that movie.  I think she liked it too.      Ok, I need to vent for a minute.  Well, not vent...just discuss.  It's sad anytime we lose a former president (I guess), and Reagan seemed like a good guy.  I remember him being president, but at that time, I was more a backyard thinker than a global one.  I understand his contributions to the country though.  But he was 93 years old.  That's longer than any president has ever lived.  I guess it makes sense since he was the oldest elected.  But really, let's be honest.  Hasn't everyone been expecting this for a while now?  It makes me wonder how long ago these ubiquitous Reagan tributes were created.  Maybe five years ago some stations decided to get a group of people to work on them.   Ok guys...he's old.  Let's put something together.  Be as general as possible.  Let's add some inspiring music and some pictures.  Oh what the heck...how about a quote or too?  Ok, now put this on the shelf over there until he croaks.   Ok, it  is  sad that he had Alzheimer's.  And it is good thing that this disease is getting more attention through raised awareness.  But to be honest, I'm getting tired of hearing about Reagan.  Are we going to have memorials in every single state?  It's nice to hear about something other than the war in Iraq, but this story seems to be monopolizing the airwaves.  Everytime I turn on the TV or radio, there's something about him.  I almost expect the news anchors to look at the camera after fifteen minutes of Reagan talk and scream "He was a great man!  Don't you see it?!?!"  Well, I guess it will all die down in a few days.  Call me unpatriotic.  It just seems like the media "overplays" a story.  Kind of like a song you really like.  The first few times you hear it, it's interesting.  You really want to hear it.  Then you can't escape it.  It plays all the time until you are tired of it.  So please, CNN, change the station.

       Bad things to think about:   -I got in a wreck on Monday.  My front bumper is barely hanging on now.  My car is driveable, but I can't drive it because apparently some ticket I got in July of 2002 was never "taken care of" and my license has been revoked since then (no one bothered to let me in on that little secret).  My insurance should cover the two small dents in the lady's car that ran into mine.  Oh, but wait...no, looks like my insurance lapsed because of the accident.  I have to call and find out tomorrow.  Looks like almost every cent of this financial aid money I just got will go to taking care of this.  I have to go to court July 27th.  The tickets will more than likely be thrown out.  I have to go to the DMV and settle that issue and get a new license.  And I have to try and get my front bumper fixed.    -I'm having to ride the bus to the mall every day after class and walk to places to run errands before work (which I also walk to).  Which means that from 8:00 am today until 10:15 pm, I'm away from my apartment.  By the time I get to work, I'm sweaty because it's humid and about 2,000 degrees outside.  Then I have to bum a ride home from someone at the end of the night.  -I have so much homework and barely enough time to do it.  I'm reading in my free time and working on writing Friday's speech every chance I get.  -Over the last few days, my computer progressively started screwing up, and as of yesterday, it won't even start up properly.  So I have to come up here to this stupid and slow computer lab and check my email and stuff late at night.  -I have a bunch of stuff I've had to buy for school and work and the only time I have had to do it has been between school and work.  -I'm fat and I haven't gotten to work out like I had wanted to.  -Amanda (the person I want to hang out with and talk to more than anyone) is 350 miles away.  -I never get to talk to Evan anymore and I really miss him.  I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like he doesn't want anything to do with me.  I was looking at old pictures of me and him last night and we used to be really good buddies.  I don't know what changed.  I wish I could still be someone that he gets really excited to talk to.  Someone he looks up to and comes to for advice or just to talk.  I love him a lot and I wish I could hang out with him more.    Good things to think about:   -Even though it's all really overwhelming to think about at once, I know that if I just take care of one thing at a time with this wreck thing, it will all work out.  I may not end up with as much extra money as I had hoped for, but things really will be resolved and I know that.  -It's good that there is a bus that runs to the mall (which is kind of close to Panera), even though I was complaining about it.  It's better than having to walk the whole way.  Walking from the mall to run my errands is also good exercise, which I was complaining about not having enough time for.  -Even though I do barely have enough time to do my homework, I'm staying on top of it.  I'm not letting myself get behind.  So maybe I have to work really hard for a while with no fun stuff.  I can reward myself later.  It will be worth it.  -Maybe it's a blessing that my computer has stopped working.  It forces me to be productive.  After I get this car stuff taken care of, I will be able to take my computer somewhere and have it looked at.  No big deal.  -I was able to buy some things for work and school that I really needed.  And they were pretty convenient to get on my way to work.  -I'm not really that fat.  I do want to lose weight, but just because this week is super stressful and busy doesn't mean that I can't find time for exercise soon.    -I talked to my parents last night and they made me feel good and gave me a sense that everything will be ok.  Then again, they're always like that.  They always calm me, get me to look on the bright side, put things into perspective, and remind that things will work out.  And they are always right.  I love them.  I don't think they realize how much they mean to me.  -I get to see Amanda this weekend!  She's riding with her mom to Wilmington and on the way (on Friday night) they're gonna pick me up and I get to go to Wilmington and stay with them and Amanda's grandparents until Sunday.  I'm scheduled Saturday night but I think I've found someone to work for me.  I'm so excited.  I get to see my beautiful and amazing girlfriend.  I'm so excited.  Speaking of Amanda, she is so nice.  She told me she was going to mail me a necktie from home so I don't have to buy one.  (I need it for my speech Friday.)  I got home from work tonight and it was already here.  Inside the envelope was my tie, a nice letter from Amanda, and a CD I've wanted for a while.  I would say which one it is, but I think I'll keep that a secret so no one makes fun of me.  Being apart from her isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  I thought I would be sad all the time.  But I'm not.  Because when I think about being apart from her, it just makes me think about how awesome it will be when I get to see her again.  Thinking about her and missing her makes me love her even more.  It makes me wonder how on earth people can go on shows like the Real World and Road Rules with serious girlfriends or boyfriends back home and end up cheating on them or breaking up.  Their relationships must have been nothing compared to the special thing that Amanda and I have found.  I think maybe once in your life, you find someone that feels different from all the rest...someone you feel a spark with that never goes away.  That's how I know that I could never let some girl come between Amanda and me like what happens on those MTV shows.  Sure, there are other girls here.  I work with a bunch of girls and a lot of girls come into Panera and I talk to them.  I have classes with girls.  And some of them are even pretty.  But when compared to this awesome girl that I've somehow been lucky enough to get to spend time with and get to know, they're just meaningless and dull.  Amanda is the one for me...my one true love.  She is the fire that fuels me, the medicine that cures me, and the air that sustains me.  I wouldn't change anything about her.  I had a dream and she came true, and now I'm never letting go.    OK, so I would say that the good things in my life right now definitely outweigh the bad.

      A lot has happened lately so I needed to fill everyone (all 3 of you) in on what has been going on.  As far as the wreck goes, I still haven't heard from the lady.  I'm going to call her tomorrow and I'm also taking my car to the body shop to get an estimate.  I don't really feel like saying anymore about it right now though.  After my first speech (which I got a 94 on), I came home and took a nap.  When I woke up, there was a bright light and the most beautiful angel appeared above me, smiled, and told me she saw great things ahead of me.  Well, actually, it was Amanda, who had traveled all the way from Hendersonville to pick me up to spend the weekend with her and her family in Wilmington.  I couldn't type enough to express how excited I was to see her.  I was thrilled.  We had only been apart for about a week, but it had felt like much longer.    We drove to Wilmington and talked the whole way.  We got to Betty and Jack's house (E-Mama and Daddy Jack to you Sextons) around 9:30, unloaded our stuff, and sat and talked for a while.  They fed us some snacks and at around 11:30, Laura and Bob got there (It sounds weird to call her Laura, by the way).  After we all talked some more, we went to bed.  I slept on the bed but Amanda took the couch, which I felt really bad about.    We accidentally slept in the next day.  Amanda and I had planned on waking each other up early, but we didn't get up until a little after 10:00.  We grabbed some breakfast, packed up some stuff, and headed out to the beach to meet Laura and Bob.  We ended up spending the whole day there.  I was grumpy for about an hour, and looking back, I don't even remember why.  But I finally cheered up and it was a lot of fun.  I forgot to bring my swimsuit though.  Amanda really wanted me to swim with her, but I had shorts on that would have been uncomfortable if they'd gotten wet.  I felt bad about not swimming with her, but I think she had a lot of fun wading, swimming, and boogie-boarding.  I read some from my urban legends book for school and after we had been there a while, we got ahold of Kelly.  She came out for about an hour and hung out.  Then something really cool happened.  I looked over towards the dunes, and there, coming down the steps onto the beach, was Betty and Jack.  Maybe I was the only one that was surprised, but I thought it was really cool.  I guess they had just felt like going for a ride and had decided to stop by and say hey.  That night, Jack took all of us (Betty, Amanda, Laura, Bob, Bill, Kelly, and me) to eat at La Costa.  I wasn't really in the mood for Mexican (I had my heart set on Carabba's), but I think it was some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.  I  was really impressed.  Later, Amanda drove me to Kohl's and I found a really good deal on two shirts.  One is a light-blue polo that I can wear to work and the other is a comfortable red shirt that looks really good on me.  That night, when we went to sleep, I insisted on letting Amanda take the bed.  When I went out to the living room to lay on the couch, Jack was still awake watching a game, so we sat there for a while and talked.  I like that I feel comfortable around just about any member of Amanda's family, even when she's not around.    The next day, we got up pretty early and Laura, Bob, Amanda, and I went to the new aquarium at Ft. Fisher.  I was really excited to go and it was a lot of fun.  It wasn't very exciting when we first started...just some outdoor tanks with turtles, big fish, and Venus Fly Traps.  But then we saw really cool alligators and frogs.  After we went inside, it got really pretty.  There were tanks with horseshoe crabs you could touch, blowfish, jellyfish, and multi-colored tropical fish.  Amanda got inside this little crab statue and stuck her head through the hole and it looked like the crab had an Amanda face.  It was really funny.  On the opposite end of the room stood a giant two-story tank which had two divers inside it giving a presentation.  This tank contained stingrays, sharks, eels, hammerheads, and a wide assortment of really big fish.  There were also exhibits about NC's river systems, shark jawbones and teeth, endangered species, hurricane devastation and relief, and interesting things to read about each of the fish we saw.  I really had a lot of fun.  On the way out, the exit path was a trail through some flowers and a bird-watching area.  Amanda and I stopped in front of some white oleanders and had our picture taken.  Amanda says it's an incredibly good picture of us.  I usually hate pictures of myself, so I'll have to check it out.  I'm sure she looks good though...she always does.  As we were leaving, a storm came and we drove through pretty hard rain and slow traffic for about 20 minutes.  Laura and Bob had decided to catch a ferry to Southport to see a street festival and go shopping, but Amanda and I went back to Jack and Betty's.  On our way, we talked to Kelly on the phone and she said Bill could take us fishing.  So Amanda and I stopped to eat lunch at Smithfield's (GREAT barbecue) and then headed to Bill and Kelly's.    After watching yet another of Bill's hanggliding adventures, we left and went to Topsail.  We stopped in Surf City to get some shrimp bait.  We had our own pier to sit on that belonged to one of Bill's friends.  He had rods and reels for us to use and he taught us how to bait, cast, and reel it in.  It was SO much fun...I had a blast.  I caught 4 fish!  And I've never even been fishing before (unless you count the time when I was 3 or 4 and I went with my grandpa and I was too afraid to touch anything).  My biggest fish was a croaker, about 5 inches long, and it made this funny...well, croaking...sound.  We released the larger fish and saved the smaller ones to put in the crab traps.  Amanda did really well.  She caught 3 fish and one of hers was 6 inches long!  I was really proud of both of us...especially since Kelly and Bill didn't catch anything.  Amanda made one of the things on "my list" come true.  I was so excited.  That night we met Laura and Bob in downtown Wilmington and watched fireworks going off over the water beside the battleship.  The fireworks were absolutely breathtaking.  We were so close, we practically had to look straight above us to see them.  They seemed to fill the entire sky.  The show lasted for about 30 minutes. It was great.  That night, I slept on the couch again.  The next day was uneventful and kind of sad.  After we packed up our things, we left and Amanda drove me back to Greenville.  Since she had a car, she was nice enough to run a few errands for me, and then she left.  I hated seeing her go after such a fun, long weekend together.  She made it home safe though, and we got to talk on the phone some that night.    So Amanda drove by herself, out of her way, just to pick me up and rescue me from being by myself for the 4th of July weekend.  I have such an amazing girlfriend.  The next week was business as usual.  Go to class every day...work a few days.  But on Thursday, Megan picked me up and we went to Havelock for the wedding rehearsal.  She was a lot of fun to talk to, and the trip went by pretty fast.  We got to the church just as everything was getting started.  It was really good to see Rick and Amanda again.  Amanda was stressed out but they both seemed excited.  The wedding coordinator put us all in or places, and we practiced entering and leaving the church, and what to do during the ceremony.  It wasn't that bad.  It didn't last as long as I thought it would.  I got paired up with Megan.  Ok, so here's the wedding party.     Groom :  Rick  Bride :  Amanda  Best Man :  Allen, Rick's cousin (Rick was Allen's best man in his wedding)  Maid(s) of Honor :  Amanda's friends Cailin and E  Groomsmen :  Jim (Rick's dad), Matthew (Amanda's cousin), Andrew (Amanda's brother), Seneca (Rick's friend), and me  Bridesmaids :  Jamie and Megan (Amanda's co-workers and friends), Jamie (Amanda's friend since they were both little kids), Sarah (Rick's sister), and Carly (Amanda's cousin)   Ring Bearer :  Corey (Rick's cousin)  Flower Girl :  Avery (Amanda's cousin)  I think I'm forgetting a groomsman, but if I am, I'll just come back in here and fix it later.  That night we had the rehearsal dinner.  It was at the Hancock Lodge on the marine base...right on the water.  It was really pretty.  Rick's dad and Nana made all the food and it was so good.  There was salad, spaghetti pizza, lasagna, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, rolls, drinks, and desserts.  The place was decorated nice too.  They did a really good job.  We all ate until we couldn't eat anymore.  Then Rick and Amanda gave out gifts to everyone helping in the wedding.  All the guys got a really cool Adidas shaving kit that you can hang.  The girls probably got some girly, cute thing...I don't remember.  That night, instead of a bachelor party, all of us guys went to this place called BJ's and played pool for a couple of hours.  We scratched, cussed, drank, burped, farted, and bragged.  It was all very manly.   There was a day between the rehearsal and the actual wedding, so on Friday, the only thing we really had to do was to go try on our tuxes.  Rick's was gray, with a gray vest and gray shoes.  The rest of the guys had black tuxes, with gray vests.  We all looked really sharp.  We didn't see the girls all day.  They were all off doing their girl stuff, like comparing toenails, moisturizing, and brushing each others' hair (I don't really know what they did).  The adults at Rick's house were babysitting for Sarah's 2-month-old son Brandon, and I got to hold him.  So there's another thing on "my list" that I got to do!  That afternoon, Allen, his wife, Rick, Corey, and I went to see Spider-Man 2.  Rick, who sees every single movie ever released the first week it comes to theaters, had naturally already seen it, but he was willing to sit through it again.  It wasn't a waste of money.  I thought it was pretty good.  Rick and I stayed up really late on both nights playing Playstation 2.  The day of the wedding was 95 degrees with a heat index of about 8,000.  After we all got dressed at the church and I walked around in it for a few minutes, I thought "this won't be so bad after all."  Then we walked outside into that heat.  I was sweating worse than Martha Stewart on the witness stand.  Beads of perspiration rolled down my face.  I folded up paper towels and put them in my pocket, blotting my forehead every chance I got.  Guests arrived, we ushered, and the time approached.  The music started and we slowly walked down the aisle and took our places.  When the bridal processional started, I looked over at Rick.  He took a big breath, filled his cheeks with air, and exhaled audibly.  Then he saw her.  Every nervous line on his face connected and formed a giant beaming grin.  Amanda looked wonderful.  Every eye in the room was on her.  She was already tearing up by the time she and her dad got halfway down the aisle.  Which naturally led each and every female member of the wedding to tear up.  Which led to the entire ceremony being a big tearfest.  Which I guess is what weddings traditionally are.  It was a nice ceremony though.  All of us felt really excited for Rick and Amanda.  I haven't been to a wedding in forever, but I actually liked it.  It made me think about the day I will hopefully get married.  I hope everything goes smoothly.  I do want to have a nice wedding...not just a small one.  I think it was one of the best days of their lives, and I hope that's how my wedding is.    After the ceremony, we took some pictures, hopped in the limo, and the entire wedding party rode to the reception together.  The reception was held at another lodge on base, but this one was bigger.  We took quite a few pictures by the water, under the trees.  A DJ announced each of us as we entered, arm in arm, and took our places at the long table in front of the room.  There was a dance floor in the middle of the room, surrounded by about 30 tables of 7-8 people each.  We got to go through the line first, and there was a lot of food.  They played some good music.  Jamie (from Chilli's) caught Amanda's bouquet.  Dax (E's boyfriend) caught the garter.  Rick and Amanda had their first dance together.  Then Rick danced with his mom and Amanda danced with her dad.  They served each other cake and Amanda smeared a huge icing-covered piece all over Rick's face.  Allan, E, and Cailin each toasted the bride and groom and we all drank champagne.  It was all a lot of fun for a while, but then the DJ started playing a bunch of slow songs and every couple there got on the dance floor and danced.  I just walked off by myself for a while.  I missed Amanda (my Amanda) and I wished she had been there.  After a while, it wasn't so bad, and the DJ started playing faster songs.  Most of the wedding party snuck out and "decorated" Rick's car.  We used toilet paper, balloons, Silly String, and something that writes on car windows.  At the end of the reception, we formed a line outside from the door to the car and blew bubbles, which Rick and Amanda walked through.  They got in the car and drove away.  It was a really fun day.   That night, I got my stuff and went to Cailin's house to stay the night.  She didn't want to sit there with her parents, so we left looking for something to do.  We went to BJ's and played a few games of pool.  Cailin ran into an old friend from elementary school and he invited us to a club at the Sheraton Hotel in New Bern.  We were there from 11-2.  We drank some and it was a lot more fun that I expected it to be.  That night we crashed at Cailin's and the next day, she drove me back to Greenville.  It was a really fun weekend.  When I got back to my apartment, I opened the door to my room and automatically knew something was wrong.  My clock was blinking and the aquarium water was murky.  I looked at the heater and it was black and melted.  The filter wasn't running...it was only faintly humming.  The fish had died.  I tried everything I could to fix it, but there had been a power surge over the weekend and it had fried the heater and the filter and I guess they shorted out.  It was so sad.  I almost had to fight back the tears as I cleaned it all up and took care of everything.  They were Amanda's fish and all I could think about was how on earth I was going to tell her.  This was Sunday night.  I talked to her Sunday and Monday, but she was in such a good mood, I didn't have the heart to tell her.  She was in a good mood again tonight, but I didn't think I should wait any longer.  I had to tell her everything.  She was super sad.  We talked through it though.  I promised her that, when she is ready again, I will buy her a bigger tank for her new apartment.  Even though it wasn't my fault, I still feel really bad.  I hate seeing my baby sad.  We kept talking, though, and we ended up laughing.  I talked to her for quite a while and she put me in the best mood.  I'm so lucky to be with such a great girl.    Time for bed.  I feel like I've been typing forever.  I'll update again soon.  I can't wait for summer school to be over.  I'll have about 25 days of freedom!  Happy Birthday Jeanne!  10 days until Amanda's birthday!  29 days until mine!
