      Helllllloooooooo... welcome. Thank you for reading this. My vision for M-power is to share with you things that raise my thoughts up to a level where I am thinking of good, looking for the good in my life and appreciating what I have and what is possible. I experience freedom every day. There are qualities, that most New Thought/Metaphysical teachings call the Qualities of God. My favorite list is Abundance, Balance, Beauty, Freedom, Harmony, Joy, Love, Order, Peace, Unity, Wholeness, Wisdom.  I admit that I view this list a bit different than other metaphysical teachers, because in my head "God" is that space between the molecules, which of course is everything and every where. What I call God is all possibility, all potential, existing in a timeless everywhere. I believe that this list is a list of high spiritual qualities and that the divine exists AS them, and I exist because of how I see myself in the relation to them. For instance.. the Universe is Abundant... you can see that with your own eyes.. how much sand is on the beach.. quite enough as it is in all of life. Now, how I feel and believe in relationship to Abundance is how I am experiencing prosperity. Either I believe and pray from a place of abundance and are prosperous, or I believe and pray from a place of lack of abundance and I am not prosperous. Most of us are some where in between, aren't we?   The Universe is Joy and I, my believe in Joy experience and express happiness! Some people believe in a lack of joy and they experience a lack of joy!     Either we see Balance or lack of Balance.. and our experience is chaos or order, depending on our belief.  Beauty or lack of Beauty... see pleasing things or the lack of pleasing things....   You get the picture...     The Universe is inclusive... and we create the way the Universe creates and we include things... we include in our thoughts and our experiences the things that we observe in the world. Literally we attract to our senses.. our sight, feeling, touching, tasting that very thing we think we deserve to have. We either attract our good OR our lack of good. Abundance or lack of abundance. Wisdom or lack of Wisdom.  I have a tendency to ramble...  To Empowerment.. here's to finding our way in this world by just including what we want in our thoughts! Here's to group spiritual practices...  For more about me and what I do, visit  urlLink www.empoweringwords.com   Namaste' Mitzi

       Happy Birthday to my angel baby, Tonya Sioux...&nbsp; she was born at 1:40 PM on this day, in 1984.&nbsp; I guess this is the way a mother is suppose to feel 20 years later, but today I feel so much good, so much love, so much awesomeness at what has happened, to both of us, over the last 20 years!     Today I want to talk about  Beauty  as a quality of God,&nbsp;opps,&nbsp;rather&nbsp;&nbsp;a quality of our highests Selves; what&nbsp; beauty is, and what it means to be a beautiful human living in a spiritual world.   We are all beautiful, each and every living thing on this planet and that includes spiders and creepy bugs.. Because, why? Because Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it is subjective to&nbsp;an individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;beliefs!&nbsp; It is an individual thing, yet  there is more beauty in this world that we see or experience with any of our physical senses!    So, what is beauty from a spiritual standpoint?&nbsp; I believe it is a state of mind, or consciousness in which we detect with our physical senses things that are&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasing.&nbsp; Beauty is what it is to each conscious being.&nbsp; It is just for each individual.&nbsp; Beauty is the vibration that is pleasing to our senses... Again subject to each perspective.&nbsp; We all filter every thing through our physical senses and our imaginations and what we know to be true. Learning comes from allowing different view points and opposite thoughts in so that we can find better and better ways of feeling, seeing, thinking, being.&nbsp;   We each, individual and together, see beauty where we want to.&nbsp; Beauty is the highest vibration we can pick up with our physical senses, it is in itself a sense... The sense of Beauty.&nbsp; Choose beauty, by looking around you and noticing things that are pleasing to your senses and the more you do this, the more you'll notice pleasing things.&nbsp; It would seem to me that the outcome of seeing more pleasing things comes from seeing pleasing things that it would feel good to see more and more things that brought pleasure.. And not just seeing, but feeling, tasting...&nbsp; An abundance of beauty surely leads to Joy!     Breath and as you do so, deeply and fully, think about how what you see with your eyes, or taste with your palate is beautiful, looking at it, eating it, smelling it allows you to feel pleasure...   Why wouldn't you want that?     This is Beauty, this is being tuned in and tapped into that Universal Beauty... The higher Truth is that EVERYTHING in the Universe, is beautiful to some one, to some creature that shares our oxygen.   Imagine that black widows find their mates so&nbsp;pleasurable, they eat him !!! &nbsp; There are many things in your life that are pleasing to your senses... When you focus on those things,&nbsp; you will see more of them, and the more pleasing experiences you feel, the more you'll want to feel...&nbsp; feeling good brings us joy and when we feel Joy, we feel Balanced.   Again, qualities of high spiritual living,   not just qualities of God, any more!     I want to say to each and every person that reads this blog(hahaha.. that words still makes me giggle)... YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!&nbsp; No matter what, there is an inner beauty, that only is covered by your belief that you are ugly...&nbsp; If you can just be willing for one small moment, to see beauty in your own eyes, that will open up the door to your beautiful soul... Then if you can just see one small thing of beauty in your life and imagine things of beauty and see your self doing, saying, feeling those things of beauty, it will comes to pass in your experience... and more will be revealed.   Any human being can see beauty because beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it is in your own eye, if you want to see beauty in your life, look at the beauty that there is now and choose to see more, to feel more, to taste more, look for more and more beauty and more will be found!&nbsp; You decided what is beautiful for you.&nbsp; Don't give any negative thought to other's beauty that you don't find beautiful.&nbsp; Remember it's all subjective and all the beauty you see, or the lack of beauty (for this works for the lack of, as well as the abundance of, remember) is what is beautiful to each person.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   When we all share a common vision, then we will see a even greater beauty. Find those that see and want your same vision of beauty.&nbsp; Make it an intention to see beauty and call forth those friends that see the same beauty as you.&nbsp;   Next quality of spirit is Joy...   Tonya, I hope that you're having a great time tonight...&nbsp; I love you!   &nbsp;  I see a world of beauty in an ever changing landscape..   Mitzi

       Today the Birthday's start... and the anniversaries, too..     &nbsp;   20 years ago today I went into labor and it's been painful ever since... two days later I had a beautiful baby girl that came into the world scarred, had a mother that was numb and a father who was drunk...3 weeks later some friends of mine came and took me away and home to my family..&nbsp; thank you, Tom and Michelle...     &nbsp;   93 years ago my Grandmother, Mabel Yuill VonLindern was born...     &nbsp;   some where around 60 years my Aunt and Uncle where married and over 18 years my cousin and his wife were married...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;20 years ago...July, 29th Tonya Sioux Lambert came into the world...     &nbsp;   5 years ago on the 30th my brother married his second wife     &nbsp;   .... and it goes on.. but we'll talk about August in August!     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   So, it's a busy week, or it has been for my family...&nbsp; but for me, the most important thing is that Tonya have a great birthday, even if it won't look like she wanted it to... she'll be safe and have fun and that's all that matters...&nbsp; Twenty years ago...&nbsp; it's a mile stone, that's for truth.         Hey, weren't we going to talk about&nbsp;Abundance?       &nbsp;   So, the first Value that we assign to God/Spirit is Abundance... and that's just what I am talking about, Abundance!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I have a rich family, abundant amount of love from family, from friends, from strangers on the  street! &nbsp; I make more friends easily as well...     &nbsp;   What is abundance? Its' a matter of perspective, isn't it?&nbsp; Would an old man from the deep jungles of Africa have a different idea about abundance than man from Wall Street?&nbsp; And women, men and vise versa, old people and young. &nbsp;Every human being has a different perspective on what abundance is to them, so how could it be a 'quality' of God?&nbsp; God is all things, so yes, abundance is a quality of God, but Abundance is also what it is for us and a thing that each one of us names for ourselves and each one of us, when we put away the belief in lack, can have and have it defined perfectly.      How?&nbsp; Well, there's the question...&nbsp; and here's the answer:    We each see, hear, taste, feel... in other words, perceive what we call either abundance or a lack of abundance in our physical body.&nbsp; Depending on where we are looking (either at abundance, or the lack of abundance) we are seeing and the more we experience it with our physical senses, the more we experience in our lives.&nbsp;     GOOD VIBRATIONS     No, that's not just some&nbsp; hippie from the 60's talk... we are vibrations.&nbsp; Look at it this way, Quantum physics teaches us that everything that exists, comes forth from what seems to be nothing and everything resides in possibility until we observe it with our physical senses and then it becomes real to us. Truly, that's how it creates.&nbsp; Here is a great web site to check out about it&nbsp;  urlLink What The BLEEP Do We Know &nbsp; Explore the possibilities.    When we vibrate with abundance we are thinking it, feeling it and experience it in some form in our lives.&nbsp; Here's a trick to get more abundance in your life.&nbsp; Sit down twice a day, morning and night and jot down 10 things to be grateful for.&nbsp; You will start noticing more and more things to be grateful for and you'll be grateful for more and more things...&nbsp; And guess what, it's still back to perspective, isn't it?&nbsp; Because what we are grateful for is only for us to say!    Abundance is having&nbsp;and being that which truly brings us Joy (another quality of God...or....).    Abundance is having loving family, if that's what brings&nbsp; you Joy... or a fat bank account, or a hunky partner, or a new deck build with friends, or friends that give with out asking...&nbsp; We are all abundant in some way... if you think I am not talking to you, then just try finding 10 things to be grateful about 2 x's a day... any one can do that.    Tomorrow we will be exploring Balance...    Live, Love, Laugh and be happy...    Mitzi     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       There are 12 so called qualities of God that many New Thought teachers talk about.&nbsp; They are; Abundance, Balance, Beauty, Freedom, Harmony, Joy, Love, Order, Peace, Unity, Wholeness and Wisdom.   In New Thought God is defined at Spirit, all knowing, all being, every where present.&nbsp; Omniscient, Omnipresent, Omnipotent&nbsp; I don't think that we can even dare limit what God, aka Spirit is&nbsp;by 12 qualities.&nbsp; I do think that these 12 qualities are some of the highest&nbsp;states of consciousness...&nbsp;states of being human, that we&nbsp;are achieving these days.&nbsp;&nbsp;   God can also be defined as that highest&nbsp;vision that&nbsp;the&nbsp;"I am" within us&nbsp;has and thus, they are qualities of God.&nbsp; Yet living spiritual in a physical world and&nbsp;being human in a spiritual world gives us the opportunity to define our spiritual&nbsp;truths the way we want them to be.&nbsp; Each day, I am going to study the 12 qualities of being human in a spiritual world and find ways to apply them to&nbsp;my life and hopefully you'll join me by&nbsp;reading and finding ways to apply them to your &nbsp;individual lives. The 12 qualities tie into the lessons that &nbsp;   urlLink  Emma Curtis Hopkins    teaches in many of her books.   I will be writing about them&nbsp; from a perspective; a point of view of the human being living in a spiritual world and how I can use these 12 qualities in my daily spiritual practice and my daily life&nbsp;(which, ideally to me, is the same thing)!   I will write about them in the order that they are in here, alphebetically, with no other signficance related to that.&nbsp; I think that in order to evolve spiritually and live in this spiritual world, we all must start from where we are at, right here, right now! Every one is in their right place, working either from a place of each of these qualities, or a lack of these qualities...i.e. each human being is either living in a place of abundance, or lack of abundance and every point inbetween.     &nbsp;  I will start tomorrow then, with Abundance.&nbsp;

       Good Morning!     &nbsp;   This blog will be all about empowerment.&nbsp; All about learning how to become empowered from with it.&nbsp; Ernest Holmes, the founder of  urlLink Religious Science  and the author of  urlLink Science Of Mind &nbsp;says; "train your mind to think what you want to thing, be what you want to be, feel what you want to feel and place no limit on Principle".&nbsp; That to me, is empowerment!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I am new to this whole thing, truly following the voice of Spirit and this web log is born out my communion with that Highest Self that I am.     &nbsp;   Many Blessings and things to come!

      Our friend Bonny has reached that right age of retirement, the age where she can start collecting her share of all that money they've been taking away from her for all her working years! We are happy she's getting it, because we probably won't it. The way the government is going, we are just going to have more problems and no one is going to be able to take care of any one else!  Oh, ye of little faith.. I affirm that the consciousness level is raised enough, when the time is right, that we actually "get it". I don't think that we can survive four more years of George. I don't think we'll have to.  At any rate... at Bonny's party that Robert and I put together, Jon and Kevin helped, also... we had a 'proclamation" from "we the people to Bonny Johnson. Here is the speech we gave her and then presented her with her first 'gubment' check!   On behalf of the United States gubment and the honorable Mr. President, Mr. Bush, We are moved to be issuing your first gubment check. Bonny Johnson has slaved her way through the last 50 years or so and by the sweat of her brow and the strength of her back, she has helped build America to the place that it is today! And for THAT Bonny Johnson, we salute you!!  We, the American people, the rest of us, are going to take care of you! We are going to send you a gubment check every month. Now noticeably it will not be as big as it once was, we have a war going on, you’ve noticed, I am sure. There is also the matter of your sexual-orientation…. It does not quite come inline with the morals of America. For that, we have to issue a ‘sin’ tax on your gubment check. Add to the fact that you are single and we’ll have to really take care of you in a few years, we are going to have to reduce the check by some, you know, to save away for the future! We want to always be able to take care of you, Bonny Johnson! And I know that you’ll want to continue to help educate America’s youngest citizens and incarcerate America’s evil people, so we’ll have to take education tax and prison tax out of your gubment check. But don’t worry, Bonny Johnson, we are going to take care of all your medical bills! Medicare CARES, Bonny Johnson, and we will provide some things for your well-being. Live, love, laugh and be happy, live that life of carefree existence you deserve! You are in good hands with the American Gubment at your side! Bonny Johnson, here is a note from our esteemed President, that he sends with his thanks:  “Dear Mrs. Johnston: It is my gratitude that goes out to you at this time, your daily devotion of service to this country at a time like this was a Christianly thing you’ve done. I mean, because of your morals and values, this country is a better place! Congratulations on the start of a great journey! Please remember our motto: “we’ll leave no senior citizen behind!” Thank you, President Bush.”  We are all there for you, Bonny Johnson. Go forth and prosper!  The American People

       Robert had seen on a church sign one time, "let the Lord have His way"..and after laughing, laughing and laughing about the visual, we decided that letting Spirit have It's way was a pretty nifty trick for the human being!  The thing is, when we can live from our spiritual mind and not the animal-human instinctual mind, we some how seem to have a more rewarding, enriched, loving life. Things seem to be more easy and life seems to arrive at our awareness in a way that allows us to make choices that are more related to the "Qualities of God".  I think that letting Spirit have Its way with my life means that I live more in harmony with that greater Life that is around me. I have no deep understanding of the why grass comes up in the spring, but I know that it does and I know that there is intelligent people on this earth that understand that process more than I do. So, I refer to them. But there are things that no one seems to understand, and to that I defer to something that, while with in me is more than I am. That is Spirit! Living in harmony with that greater awareness of Spirit we find that life is more peaceful.  The answer, I think in living more in Harmony with Spirit is in doing spiritual practices.. We practice them until we embody them, then we are living those spiritual practices. The ones that work for ME are meditation, journaling, group spiritual practice, Treatment and just conversing with people who are like-minded!  It's all a journey that we are on.. and I just want to remind people that it's easy to live in Harmony with that Spirit within when you do *some* spiritual practice!   Let the Spirit have It's way with your life!  Mitzi

      I was reading where Elizabeth Edwards, wife of our future VP, John Edwards is a large woman... I am sooo excited about this fact!!! Being a well rounded, juicy peach of a woman myself, I am delighted as goat cheese that she is going to be in the public eye! She is beautiful! I also love the spirit if our new first lady, Theresa!  BTW dear reader, do you vote??? If so, please vote for Kerry and if you don't vote, please do so this year, it's sorta important. But vote for Kerry. It's been a rough four years.  Anywhooo... I love that more women of size are getting in the media. I love that we are valued more for our worth as valid humans then what form our form is. Size, color, sexuality, religion, gender.. etc.. should not be an issue in relationships with others. We all come from the same planet, we all are on our paths, take away the skin and social structure, we are all the same.  This is what conscious evolution is... we realize our UNITY with each other and with Life it's self.  There IS something more intelligent than we can be at this time. There are forces at work for the good of this planet. There is only One Life and I can't be convinced otherwise.  There is one mind and we all use it... This one mind manifests as human and it has a physical body and brain, but is the breath of Spirit. That's that Unity of mind and body and spirit. One, three modes of manifestation.  Unity... We are all One..  I don't know what else to say on that!  If you live from the ego consciousness, one would be a lonely number...  Unity.  Mitzi

      Interesting show today... why do people have to pick on people that are happy.... all these women that are going after the younger man....hmmm.. Hey, the best thing about being 40 is that at forty, I can take a man twenty years younger! So, OK, he was 5 months shy of being and 18 and he was her student... I can see the student thing.... there does have to be that sacred trust.. but she lost her career, but now a baby and a cuuute young man.. He'll be horny for years to come... hehe.  Hello! Good day. When the koan "what is the sound of one hand clapping" first came out, didn't they know how to make noise with just one hand? Didn't they watch Simpsons??  It's amazing to watch both my daughter and husband going through their own growth process.. they are both angry at everything and mostly me.. which has been a challenge because I can't *stand* it when people are mad at me! I used to be the HUGEST people pleaser... now people can serve themselves if they are going to be mean! But truthfully, I *love* to serve and if Tonya and Jon would figure that out and treat me like the queen that I am, I'd be much nicer to them.. does that make as little sense to you as it does to me? Seriously, though she is my biggest challenge, my funniest puzzle and my greatest love... And he is, too.. .although I have no idea where we are going, but I thought as long as I am here, I might as well be the best I can be.  So... check in with yourself...breath, relax, throw your shoulders back, smile a good smile..  Do you know that it's difficult to think of negative, worrisome things when you are smiling really big and cheesy??? Try it.. paste your biggest, brightest smile on your face, take some deep breaths, hold them, smile for the count of 10, but try to think of something 'negative' in your life... hard to do.. So, think of having an abundance of what you want!  Smile, breath, smile, breath.... just don't chew bubble gum!  waiting for autumn.. Mitzi

       Does it really? I mean here is one day with the intention to write *something* every day, and here it is three days later?  And nothing much has been happening; except that my friend Robert and I are building a web space together...  our computers and idea factories are shacking up, hooking up and becoming one.  Here is our Space  urlLink http://www.winwinsolution.biz   You can't buy anything just yet…  but check it out, get on our email list, please...     It does feel good to be moving together in solution with Robert and our future customers, partners, friends, and so on!  I don't remember what quality I said I would talk about next, but I am feeling most is Freedom.  Freedom is a quality of high spiritual living that expresses as a feeling or experience of freedom.  The feeling of freedom is different for every one, individual in the way it expresses It's self in life.  The feeling of Freedom is yet another way that we feel our Divine Connection!  And Freedom is felt in our lives as we believe Freedom feels like! Imagine your highest feeling of Freedom! When I was a kid, that feeling was roller coasters or motorcycles... man what a free feeling, to be flying in the wind, knowing that your fate rested on KNOWING fully that you would be All RIGHT... that was a feeling of pure connection and great feeling of energy rushing through my body! I have that same feeling when I jet ski as an adult.. a rush of fear followed by an instant knowing that I am going to be OK...  So, what feeling can you remember about Freedom and the way it feels to you?  It does not matter when it happened, or how short it was, it's all about the feeling.  Sit back and relax and try to remember feeling Freedom.  Feel it in your mind by remembering, feel it in your body, in the middle of your stomach and lower... feel it as deeply as you remember feeling it by remembering the experience in your mind...  Our human mind does not know the difference and will release the same chemicals that were first produced if we give it time...  So, relax, remember and save a moment for the feeling.  The next question is what can you do, now... to bring that feeling.. Remembering is great and remembering with feeling can bring thoughts, desire, feelings, people, advents, etc that revive that first experience of Freedom.   But taking action on the feeling brings those advents, people, thoughts, etc. a bit faster and freer than you could quite imagine... you see, you are adding your agreement with the highest Truth you know.  And any time that you agree with Spirit, your experience of those High Spiritual Truths like Freedom flow more easily, more naturally into your experience!!  Imagine what brings you Freedom!  Feel that through out your whole body as you re-imagine what Freedom feels like...  take action towards Freedom that comes to you...  as you agree with Spirit and see Freedom every where in your life, you raise your vibration and more and will be revealed.  This is evolution! This is Freedom!  Freedom... for me, that feeling that the Universe is in Divine Order and as I connect to that Highest Truth with in me, I recognize that that feeling as Energy that flows through my body with Joy and Trust and Understanding.  Freedom of choice, freedom of Life is the Highest Truth I can imagine. I know that as Freedom manifests in all things, Freedom manifests and expresses as me, in me and in my experience! I experience freedom in my expression and in my affairs, in my spiritual practice and in my physical life.  I am free to be my highest expression always... and I am.  I speak my word for every one who reads this Blog and I know that they have with in them the Power to feel Freedom as well.  I know that as they read, they experience what every Freedom means to them and Freedom expresses in their lives.  I affirm that at the level of their acceptance of their good and of Freedom, it expresses in their lives.  I see each and every individual as a perfect and clear channel for his or her highest Good! I give thanks for Understanding and Clarity and Freedom!!  WooooHooo..... :) :)  I release my word, my prayer.. into that unified, harmonized consciousness that is One!  It is done as we believe! and so it is!!  Yes, this is good!  Moving together in Freedom!   Mitzi

      The Nature of Spirit One Mind… present everywhere, always, in all things, as all things. Spirit/Intelligence is the Earth and the rock. It is the Ocean and the raindrop. It is the Fire and the spark. It is the Hurricane and the summer breeze. It is the Mountain AND the molehill.  Energy/Intelligence does not care if it is the storm or the calm, it is both, and water does not mind if it flows through the rapid cursing river or the wide, meandering stream, it is both. This Energy and Intelligence that becomes all things comes from nowhere, according to our physical senses, yet it is everywhere and is all things.   The Nature of Me The difference between me and the rock, raindrop, spark and breeze is that I have some level of conscious awareness. I can choose what to think, how to feel, where to go, what to experience. The rock and I are made of the same things, yet I breathe and I move and I sing and laugh and dance. I choose and that makes all the difference.  Being all things, this Energy and Intelligence is what I am. As I move and as I breathe and as I think, I am. Because I duplicate the nature of Energy and Intelligence, I can be any thing. As I think, as I feel, I create.  I am vibration, which is energy. I am consciousness, which is Intelligence. I have the capacity to KNOW who I AM. I have some intelligence to choose WHO I am and WHAT I am. I duplicate the nature of Spirit as ME. I can do ANYTHING that I can conceive in my mind. I can’t do everything; I have physical limits, at this time. Evolution of my Spirit-Self renders even physical limitations a choice. The All does not care what the I is or does, IT is all things. It does not delight, It is. I call it Spirit because for me, that is the highest Ideal I can imagine with my limited physical senses, but this is good because as I evolve in my own spiritual expression, which means Spirit-Self, more and more becomes revealed to me.  Duplicating the Nature of Spirit in ME I affirm for myself the power of choice in every single thought and feeling and action! I affirm that I choose thoughts, feelings and actions that bring forth joyful experiences. I’ve decided that Joy is the highest consciousness for me, and it is my Intention to think joyful thoughts and feel joy and take action that creates experiences of joy as my life! I simply allow Spirit, which is everything, to BE Joy as me. My life that is as Spirit, then becomes as I desire it, as I intend for it!  My thoughts bring my feelings, which brings my experience… my own unique experience. I USE the Energy and call it Mind or thinking or feeling…  I use it uniquely according to my unique thoughts! Not one person has all the same thoughts as another, yet we all use the same mechanism for thought and feeling. Everything I experience in the outside world is created from the same energy and intelligence that is everything. Everything is a vibration. Vibrations like to match. I think, I feel and I take action, which creates a Vibration… I include in my vibration the things i think about, which creates feeling, which tells the vibration which frequency to vibrate in. Depending on the frequency of my own special vibration, i attract TO me, the same Energy frequency. The question then becomes; what do I want to have/be in my experience? How long do I want it to last? How good do I want it? We can’t seem to answer what our Spirit-Self has as lessons, but what I believe is that the more evolved I am the better it gets, so what ever I have now, regardless of how Good I think it is, has the potential of getting even better! So, I want good. I want experiences that are fun, joyful, loving, abundant, opulent, balanced, beautiful, free, harmonious, peaceful, feelings of unity, wise. I take time to remember this Intention and change the very thoughts in my own unique mind. I do this to reflect the Intention of LOVE that I’ve set, the highest vibration I can feel, to experience the best adventures I can. I can only do this for ME. We all have the potential for anything we can imagine. This is good stuff!  Thank you.. Gratitude feels good. Gratitude gets me to thinking of good things in my life. I remember that I am in charge of my thinking and I relax and remember to appreciate the good in my life. I want more good, I appreciate whatever form that good is appearing in the moment, in the Now. When I groove on the good in the NOW, I automatically get Good in the Future. What feelings I think from, I experience. Thinking thoughts of appreciating brings more things to appreciate! It is my intention to stop often and appreciate how Life is showing up for me.

      out of no where, an odor offensive enough to make a growing boy proud. I looked around for the dog, naturally, because Jon was not home, but Buford was nowhere in site, nor where the cats. Spooky was eating and looked at me with sheer indignation when I suggested that the odor might be her expulsion. Then I realized what it was... One of the 'girls' had left a morning sooper-dooper pooper.   See what I have to put up with????   Tonya came  home in an altered state last night... (family members would be humored to remember, "here, kitty, kitty, kitty" )  If you don't know ask about it in the 'comments' section and my mom can answer them, she would LOVE to tell you all about it!   Annnnyyywayyyyyy....  she figured I'd be mad at her, but I know that the consequence of her choice will hit her when she wakes up... I couldn't put that kind of punishment on her... It's Karma...  although Tonya insists on call it bad luck.  Ha!  Ernest Holmes said that there was no sin but a mistake and no punishment but a consequence... and you can't get it wrong, the Universe is folding out excatly like it's suppose to.  Don't you agree?

       I did nothing but watch tv and the remote's been lost since breakfast!  Well, that's NOT true, and I did have a great day, but a very strange one as well... I think lots of healing on a deep level took place and I also realized today how far I've grown.  My daughter proclaimed her hate and disgust for me. Apparently, even though I have been working hard the last month building our e-biz's, she thinks that all I do is sit on the computer and play... well, OK, I admit, I am having fun, fun seems like playing and I have been doing it on the computer! What appears to be one thing, is really another!  Now when she was doing her ranting and raving, I was remembering that this is about her confusion in her life, her frustration and her pain of her best friend being on the streets, strung out on meth.. Tonya cares so much, perhaps too much. I think I was her age when I read, "Women How Love Too Much" for the first time.. perhaps I should find her a copy.      So, this is what I learned today.    I have a vagina!!   No, that's not true. I mean, it is, but what I learned was far more reaching.. .. what I remembered was that I was not so much one to find my own way, but to define a way that is already present. I have always liked to redefine words. I think that we redefine words all the time, but no one wants to admit that we do. Remember the 1st gay nineties.... the last one was just not the same gayness... gay meant happy, now not many  remember  happiness, but no one confuses it with gay! Have I made my point?  For years I've been trying to find and refine my definition of God. I have tried NOT to call that 'Thing' that is everything, God because of what it meant for so many people.. Ugh, an angry, controlling, evil watching, hard ass, do as I say, not as I do type God... again, ugh, my mother was like that, too...  (just kidding Mom!)        So, my higher self asked my lower self, I mean; in my meditation I had this flash of intuition.. "this isn't working, redefine and teach them your definition of God". I just said Yes!   Here is my story and my re-definition of God:  God is that space between all the molecules. Since we can literally see, going small enough, there are really not any molecules, God is all that space. God is all  possibility  and all  potentiality . God is the wave and the particle. The particle is life, the wave is energy and it is every where, all the time.  The particle becomes form, life... and the wave energizes the form . God exists as time and space, all possibility and all potentiality. This space between the molecules, this space that is every where, at all times has the possibility to potentially BE anything.   What is it that makes nothing become something  ???  My answer is that it is the observer. What is the observer? Good question. I think that it is the sum total of all potential, everything that is possible. What is possible? What is NOT possible? Really, think about it.  So, the sum total of all things is the Observer .  ( I felt an urge to capitalize this really huge thing, the Observer)  But here's the best part... I think WE are the Observer! Or rather, the Observer(being the sum total of all things) becomes ALL THAT IT OBSERVES. Hence, we are the Observer. We have form, and we observe. We are made of particles and energy. We have potential to become anything that is possible. Anything is possible.  Dare to believe it !  Aren't convinced? Just imagine the possibility if that were true! Would believing that make you experience more freedom?  I bet the Wright brothers  imagined  flying; soaring through the skies, feeling a great and holy sense of Freedom. I bet they studied all the previous wisdom on flying, I bet they studied how God accomplishes it. If you can imagine it, you will see it happening some where in that space between the molecules. Remember that space between the molecules contains all possibility and the potential to become what it is that you see! So, they imagined, they saw themselves doing it, studied the wisdom of the ages and experienced it in nature and the figured out how to do it. Do you imagine that when the Wright brothers flew for the first time, that they felt FREEDOM? I imagine they did!!   Back to the Observer . When the Observer observes the space between the molecules where everything is possible and they see a potential, that potential is immediately formed. Depending on the amount of observation on this potential, the stronger, larger, denser the form. The form becomes a mold in which becomes filled with that space of all potential and all possibility. What we observe becomes form. And even though form is always filled with all possibility and any potential, it becomes...inside the form...that which observed IN the form. IF in that space of all possibility I see fearful, sad, bad, evil things, that is what form possibility is going to take. It becomes potential fear, sadness, badness and evil. The more fear, sadness, badness and evil that the Observer sees in the form, the more the space of all possibility becomes filled with that potential. The potential becomes form, and the more the Observer observes the form, the stronger, bigger it gets.    So, the lesson there, Dear Reader is to see only good things in the space between the molecules.        Mitzi

        yet my computer has slowed way down... What is *that* all about??  I just finished a three day project at Beloved Deborahs, so today I am taking a rest from physical work to love work, working on the websites. I am having a great time; mostly because it's almost 5 pm, and I am still in my pajamas and NO BRA!!  I have a question I was pondering and I thought I'd share: Why does the physical world seem to be such a contrast to spiritual? Answer is that it's not. Yet I started this thread of thought, prompted by the Biblical quote, " . . . In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." John 16:33. Of course that's Jesus being quoted, and I am sure it's right;  after all , it was only a few hundred years after he left this planet that it was wrote down! Also, remember Jesus was quoted as saying something like, "anything I can do, you will do and more.." So, it must be true that  WE  must over come the "world".  The world in biblical means the physical form. Imagine this; everything in the world, our physical world, the earth and everything that is created; either by  US  or  Something greater than us,  is made from the same thing and it comes from the same source! The world exists because it is NOT contrast to the spiritual world,  but a slower, massive vibration of the spiritual world .   Having awareness  of the spiritual world, there is a whole new set of rules to play by! We are living  in  a spiritual world and  having  a spiritual experience!! Yet, the Biblical world is that world that has slowed down... a place where humanbeings are   infinite Spirit having an individual expression as ME!         I've evolved to a space where I know that the only game in town is that this is a spiritual universe. The world, the earth, the matter of this plane of existence is still  spiritual , just slowed down in vibration to the point that mass gathers! We are always fully supported by the laws of the Universe! Physical beings in this dimension attract energy to themselves the same frequency as we release energy. The energy that is attracted produces the experiences that we have.  So, since Jesus was just another   "infinite Spirit having a individual expression as ME",   then I am too. And since Jesus (and other masters, that have come to teach and lead us) said that what they could do, we could do and more,   then I too will over come the world!      Sure I will... it's as simple as continuing to spiritually evolve!
