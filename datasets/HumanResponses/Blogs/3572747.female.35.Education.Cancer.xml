      Soooo....what is it about gay men that we need to have drama in our lives?  Don't get me wrong...a little spice in life is nice, but why do we have to constantly hurt each other (or talk behind each other's back)?  We constantly have a desire to dish each other.  I look at the example of a pride event that I attended last weekend.  The purpose of the whole event was to celebrate who we are as a family.  It was really nice seeing our community come together at such an event and be able to be who we really are.  I also notice the dark side to the event.  We all were constantly reviewing each other and critiquing other men.  Why do we do this?  I really think that it is a defense mechanism for us so that the attention is not upon us.  If we ridicule another person, maybe everyone else will not look at me!  Hmmmm

      So...welcome.  You have stopped by on my journey through my life as a gay man.  First, let me give you a little background.  I am 35 years old and live in central california.  I recently moved here after being on the East coast for 10 years.  Since I am originally from the West Coast, I realized that it was time to move back (I was really tired to the snow....which is something that I really don't have to deal with out here).  I work here in the central valley and recently bought a house in December (yippee...no more rent..though, now I have a mortage).  I think that I have always known that I was gay but was afraid to admit it.  I know, I know..you have all heard it before.....a good natured, well rounded, over achieving kid how was afraid to admit who he really was.  I guess that I was also a late bloomer since I didn't want to disappoint my parents.  I finally came out of the closet when I was around 28 years old.  I had done all the research about coming out (don't do it during the holidays, don't do it over the phone, etc.).  Since I was out on the east coast, I had limited opportunities to see my family (I would only see them 1-2 times a year).  Finally, as my parents started to think about retirement, they ended up going to visit Palm Spring (of all places, one of the best gay areas in the country).  I was more than eager to meet up with them for a visit and get away from the cold and snow of the east coast.  In my mind, I had thought that my Dad would be cool with the whole thing and Mom would have a problem.  I could not have been more wrong.  Mom was acutally o.k. (she even went to a PFLAG meeting) and Dad had issues (where did he go wrong, was he a bad parent, etc.).  To this day, we really don't talk that much about me...rather, we talk about money and the weather (all safe topics).  I have not had the occasion to bring home a boyfriend to meet the family yet so that will still be a hurdle to overcome.  (I am currently taking applications for the role of boyfriend in my life...Any takers?).  :)  Well, I guess that is it for my opening of my blog.  Stay tuned for more updates as things progress.  You will be getting updates on the lovelife (if there is anyone out there for me), thoughts, funny stories and ideas.    Later....
