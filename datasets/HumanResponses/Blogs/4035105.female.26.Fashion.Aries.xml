       urlLink    photo by mp78.&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;   sometimes, i want to take my time. Slow up. But if I pace myself, where would i go?  turning to corners i find dead ends. running seems the only way to get where i need to go.  even though i haven't a clue where i am going. i just need to run. i need to leave where i am at.  sense of urgency comes and goes.&nbsp; i wish it just went and not come back at all.  &nbsp;

       urlLink    photo by unknown party person at ..well a party urlLink     best friends, together like glue and paper. paths take you different roads, but you always pass each other at the usual park and stop. conversations turn into verbal diaries of fustrations, each other's shoulder to cry on, or ears to laugh in.  i never understood people who didnt have a best friend, how can they survive? i know i can't, and i know i wouldn't be here if it weren't my for best freind. saved me form many things:  too many pills taken one day....there she was to take me to st.mary's. took a stalker blind date to where she worked...there she was to save me ass. wore jeans that made me look horrible..there she was with a car to get new ones. got drunk at her house and broke two bathroom tiles with my head, all the while i was buttnaked...there she was to make sure i didnt throw up on her couch and got me panties.  see.. that is what a best freind is.  i wonder at times if i am as good as she is to me...  &nbsp;

       urlLink    photo by a drunken friend.&nbsp; urlLink     ...of hitting up in the ass when you least except it. i knew i had a thing for redheads, but i never saw this coming.  i went in for a job interview...cut to two months later, i have a new job and a new boyfriend. its interesting...i wasnt looking for him, and there he was. not to say we are perfect, cause we are not, but i learned from my mother how to paint pretty pictures for eyes to see.  love is there, but fustration is too. i guess we all try to learn from each other's mistakes and attributes. but my patience at times seems far to reach. eventually i grab it, and pray that i dont have to seek for it again.   &nbsp;  thats love for you...through good and bad.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       urlLink    photo by jredlyte.&nbsp; urlLink    luca brasi and i, a dangerous team if i ever saw one. we attack with hugs and kisses, and sometimes biting ( on his behalf).  thats what we are. its funny how people say dogs are like their owners. in some ways , luca and i are alike..in others we are not. for instance, i cant pee on paper nor can i chew through a large piece of plastic in one day. same goes for luca, he can't shop on ebay, nor can he curse me in spanish like i do to him when&nbsp; i step on the his turds. but we are alike..we both like to cuddle, but we like to chill alone...and if you get us annoyed, we make sure you know to stay away. we got curly hair...his is black..mine is kaka brown.  luca, the boy i call n*gga grover, so cute so black...love him to pieces, even though given the chance i know he would chew me to pieces.  he has an attitude, more with me than anyone, but its pure love he growls i cuddle him then he licks my face, i tickle him, then he growls again...and i know to stop...yeah im scared of him. he bites hard , but show remorse afterwards. he'll lick the blood as you scream for help.  what a good boy he is.

      first times are always a bit odd. nervous of the outcome, not sure what to say  or do. mind races to dead end corners, so you come back to square one.  here i am . my first time. my nerves are in form of type-o's  my racing mind is in form of what to write.  but , instead of going through with it and have regrets later, i will have a glass of wine, and relax.
