      okay so i was meeting christian, jehan, and sharath for dinner at surin, everyone's favorite thai cafeteria.  i had spent the past two hours watching requiem for a dream with nito, the combination of which kind of had me bugging already.  i hopped the #2 ponce from north ave and was riding in peace when this guy got on, walked towards me, and stopped.  he leaned in and said, "juicy. hey juicy. can i go witchu?" i rolled my eyes and ignored him as best i could, exhaling loudly and crossing my arms. "mmmmm mm mm, you are so juicy. i bet a nigga just melt inside you." his breath smelled old and sour, like when you didn't brush your teeth before bed and then slept all night with your mouth wide open.  "sssss, goddamn i wanna pull yo hair." i jumped up and made my way to the front, getting off at the next stop.  it was only two blocks before my stop, anyway, and it was a nice night.  i started walking, staring to my right at the destruction/construction site of A&P.  the majestic's neon sign crackled on the next block. i walked on, the man on the bus slowly disappearing from my circle of concern.  i heard a sound behind me. a giggle, maybe.  i heard footsteps maybe three yards back.  so what, i'm walking down ponce.  nobody would try anything here.  another giggle and a break in the cadence.  i kept walking.   "hey girl, i like your hair."  "thank you." giggles. (whispers) "u need to stop." giggles. "oh yeah, you REAL cute." giggles. "i know." "ooooh, no that fish didn't just..." fish?  "hey college girl. where's daddy?" i looked back with my best round-the-way-girl grill and kept walking.  "oh yeah, u hear us, daddy's girl. why u riding the bus? daddy took your car away? you got a bus pass?" i turned to face them, armed with a rotating neck and a smart mouth, but nothing came out.  my harrassers were not atl hotgirls from the block. they were six foot something men dressed in drag. and not just a tank top, skirt and wig.  i'm talking sequins, platforms, immovable boobs, the whole nine. "you gotta be fuckin kidding me." i shook my head and kept walking. "where u think u goin with my bus pass, bitch?" "whatever, bitch," i hollered back. "yeah, you got a bus pass. you got some money, too, rich girl?" "not for you," i said with my lips pursed and my eyes cutting, and went to cross the street. "what? get that fish, miss chris!" i got pulled back from the street by my hair.  i was pushed back and forth between the two drag queens and then thrown to the ground.  one held my arms while the other went through my pockets and purse.  they took my cash and bus pass, but nothing else. "come on miss chris!!!" one yelled, and they ran off. i sat on the curb with my pockets like rabbit ears for about two minutes, then got up and continued walking to surin.  by the time i got there, my friends had finished eating.   "where were u? u took too long so we ordered." "man zhaleh, did u not hear that we were meeting at 8? its, like, going on 10." i picked up a menu and held it in front of me, hiding the tears. "hey. hey are you okay?" "yeah. i...yeah. i just got mugged." "you what?!" "oh man, are you okay?" "yeah, i'm alright." i looked around at the concerned faces at the table. "i got mugged by two drag queens." silence. the faces struggled to hold their concern. still silence. mouths wiggled, cheek muscles clenched. i don't know who went first, but everyone soon burst out laughing.  "gooooooood damn, only zhaleh." christian said.
