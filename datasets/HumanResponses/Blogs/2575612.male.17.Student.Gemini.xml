      It's New Years Eve and I'm full of empty promises,  I half pretend to keep this time, just like last year.  The band is loud and I'm wandering the shadows,  wishing I was never here. I persevere.  A crowded room, these whitewashed tombs,  they raise their glasses high, they kiss the past goodbye.   This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe,  this New Years Eve, will turn out better than before,  I'm holding on, still holding out, until they close the door... on me.   It's New Years Eve and I feel my insecurities,  are haunting me like ghosts, this sinking quicksand.  And then with thunderous praise and lofty adoration,  a second passes by, yet nothing changes.  I hate my skin, this grave I'm standing in.  Another change of years, and I wish I wasn't here.   A year goes by and I'm staring at my watch again,  and I dig deep this time, for something greater than I've ever been,  life to ancient wineskins. And I was blind but now I see.   This New Years Eve, something must change me inside,  I'm crooked and misguided, and tired of being tired.  This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe, in You.  -new year's eve. five iron frenzy-

      ...happy endings...Just what did you do, if you're a dream then comes true. Stop pretending, that what you mean isn't what you say. Hopeful dreaming of times before the pain, wishing it was still the same. Loving, Leaving. Round and round and round we go again." This is one of my favorite songs! I dont know why i posted this for my first blog, but i like it...isnt blogging kinda like Deep Thoughts with Jack Handey?    ~ben

      The questions run so deep, When its two in the morning I should be lost in sleep But in my mind i am sorting All the things that I cant explain Why so many suffer in pain? Wheres the answer?   I hide behind a smile  But in my heart i am bleeding I can sometimes read the crowd And relate to their feelings never knowing what tomorrow brings And trying so hard to just believe in something  Falling down around me is a world So incomplete It makes no sense to me How can i compete? Except to know the mercy and the comfort That you bring Inspite of me Oh its a mystery  And when i cannot see You keep my feet from falling You hold me in your peace Here in the grand scheme  We can only know in part When we're this side of heven So i'm trusting in my heart For one final amen A day when all the wrong will be made right That's all i really need to rest inside, tonight

       Twilight   Dreamily over the roofs The cold spring rain is falling, Out in the lonely tree A bird is calling, calling.  Slowly over the earth The wings of night are falling; My heart like the bird in the tree Is calling, calling, calling.  -Sara Teasdale-

      im gonna be rebellious and not "vent" to my online journal. something happened today that really kinda set me off. im not gonna get into it because i dont see what the point is.i feel like i am alone, so utterly alone. like an island that drifted from the archipelago. as my theme of my blog is, we are all on a journey by ourselves, sure there are others that may be on our path, but we are all trekking...alone.    THE ARMFUL   For every parcel I stoop down to seize I lose some other off my arms and knees, And the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns, Extremes too hard to comprehend at. once Yet nothing I should care to leave behind. With all I have to hold with hand and mind And heart, if need be, I will do my best. To keep their building balanced at my breast. I crouch down to prevent them as they fall; Then sit down in the middle of them all. I had to drop the armful in the road And try to stack them in a better load.   -Robert Frost-

      I want to learn,  i want to experience knowledge is my lifeline can you give it to me?  what else in life i cannot say so many ask: why did things turn out this way? the answer lies not with people but in history, time so no one has to ask why are things so so far gone...

      Lost in a dream world, Where nothing is quite real Where pain is oh, so surreal What happened to the days of bliss? What happened to the special kiss? Only in my imagination.  Only in my imagination, Only in my dreams, Where my real life teems, For what could be, For what i might see, This and this place alone, Is where i feel known.  My heart skips a beat, Thinking about future feats, Where we discover ourselves, Find truth, make right,  and best of all: feel true love.  What doesnt include this theme, love? it is everywhere. not just the boyfriend and girlfriend relationships, it is the cornerstone of everything that works in this world. parents and family, friends and companions. Everyone requires love. love isnt to be taken advantage of. if we can go through life and not have one  person that you would lay down your life for because you love them THAT much...what have we accomplished? nothing.

      Everyone is searching. Searching and seeking for the one thing that can make their lives worth something. Anything... Many turn to booze, drugs, and bad relationships to try to fill the immense void within their souls. Some turn to trying to be perfect, to gain wisdom and to educate themselves to their fullest extent. Some turn to religions that pound in rituals and policies so that they may spend eternity in heaven. While others decide that life is not worth living, friends are not worth meeting, animals are not worth holding, nature is not worth seeing. they kill themselves, to end their heartache and strife. the great irony. they kill themselves to get away from their own hell on earth, but then find hell. what is it that makes us tick? what is this life for? what are we to do with this short time given to us?  we learn and educate ourselves, work until we cant anymore then rest till our death comes. Is that the right way to live? what is inside of us that screams for more. to sail on the sea with the wind on our back yelling  this is it ! sitting quietly on the mountainside  listening to our echo from our soul  this is it!  And what about dangling your feet in the water while journaling your thoughts?  birds dart back and forth overhead,  while the way the trees bend and swing in the summer breeze.  Is this it?  What has happened that men dont expect more and more?   life as it is will fade the kingdoms crumbling, the plants wither, the great people die, life as it is will fade.  but as most sit and write depressing blogs like this, some get up put on their hiking boots and pack their gear. for they are to go search for the epic life and are insistent on finding it and drinking from it abundantly. the message is, if its hard for you to follow (which i dont doubt) that life will soon be drained from us. why not make a difference, why not seek for truth, and find it.

      So today i had to go to have my braces adjusted. you know how they are supposed to be gentle....? well i was thinking that if they pulled on my friggin teeth one more time, my teeth would be ripped from my gums. I'm not kidding! you think they could be a little bit less agressive when holding a sharp wire in one hand and what seems to be a torture mechanism in the other!

      Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting.   Faster and Faster still..."Quickly, give haste there is much to do!" said the young man at the age of 18.   "Quicker still slowpoke" said he at the age of 25, "i have much accomplish, are you tired now?"   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting. School. Marriage. Children. thoughts of forgotten adventure hang hidden in the back of the mind.   "There is much more time to be, let us play!" he said to his youngest, 7, he at the age of 39.   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting.   "Come now young uns', let me rest. Then i shall read a book to you." he said with the same quick eyes, his same quick humorous tongue remarks to the 4 youngest grandchildren, the oldest had much to do as of late. brushing, dancing, singing, no time for sweet ol' grandpa who now was at the ripe old age of 74!   Life is strange. Mysterious. Ever changing, ever shifting.   "I would much like to see the mountains again my boy. Where has the time gone..." this is said, he did, with no more than three hours left in him.  "Don't fret, father there is much to do still! Quickly, hurry up!"     Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,  Old time is still a-flying,  And this same flower that smiles today,  To-morrow will be dying.  To the Virgins, Make much of Time ~ Robert Herrick

      I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!  To put to rout all that was not life...  And not, when I came to die, discover  that I had not lived...   -- Henry David Thoreau

       Falling    Everything i want, i need,  is everything you've given to me, It's too much to comprehend, Your whispers go unheard, Like they're obscured.  This star that once burned bright, Is falling hard tonight, My destinations out of sight. Cause this road's so long so long so long...  Everything you want from me, I want to give to you, But everything? I have no clue. Tell me you're still here, Let me know you care.  Anytime...this star burns bright, Dont let it fall tonight, My destinations stay in sight, The road's still long, It's all in this song.  Am i on track? Well cut me no slack, The road's not smooth, I'll keep it on the move, There is no time, Well it's quarter to nine, Nothing seemed right, But i found you tonight...   My friend wrote that song and we put it to music, its awesome. whoever reads this can interpret it how you want it.

      Yeah, definately forgot to post this  OLD  poem. wow, yeah i wrote this back in like 8th grade. Nothing has been altered, this is exactly how i wrote it that night back then...i actually was in a hotel bathroom, sitting on the toilet.  not using the toilet, sitting!  haha ~benn.   Where You Think the Best   During the cool summer night, While you lie on the soft grass, Gazing at God's beautiful night sky. Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best  During the coldest winter nights, While you lie next to a warm fireplace, You float among the scarlet embers burning with delight Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best  During the quiet sleepless nights, While you lie in your bed staring blankly at the ceiling Reminiscing over the good times, and bad time, Thats where you think the best Thats where you think the best

       Really wanting to be with you right now. I think we have established that neither of us know how much.    scored the '99 grand prix today. a great car for sure. have so much running through my head. not sure how people deal with it. growing up, school, friends, boyfriends and girlfriends. juggling sports, club, and activities. life is so nuts.  *-missing you-*

      kinda summing up how im feeling.   It's New Years Eve and I'm full of empty promises,  I half pretend to keep this time, just like last year.  The band is loud and I'm wandering the shadows,  wishing I was never here. I persevere.  A crowded room, these whitewashed tombs,  they raise their glasses high, they kiss the past goodbye.   This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe,  this New Years Eve, will turn out better than before,  I'm holding on, still holding out, until they close the door... on me.    got into an aguement with my dad today. kinda sucked. i basically threw out all my feelings on him...church, youth group, friends...blah. everything. i want to be in touch with the Lord, to walk with him and be in tune and obedient. but im so far gone. i wish i had more and better friends. im so blessed but i feel so empty sometimes. as if everything that i seek to fill me leaves me feeling more empty than when i started. the lyrics kinda sum up how i feel when i see and am with these awesome, diligent christians who make me look like a heathen. isolated...alone...everday life.  Thinking about my future. my dad is really pushing me to think of wheaton. its a nice school, i'll probably go see it sometime. but money, cars, my susie, all these things are just bombarding me. ugh. life is so crazy and exciting. at this time there are so many decisions that will affect my life so much. i was asked by an anoynmous friend for advice...he was really wanting to drink and i gave him my two. even i feel like just drinking away my problems but i know that there is no way that will solve anything. foresight is a great thing to have, i know that the holy spirit is still working in me even though ive totally backed off. i dunno these feelings are eating me up.  A wise friend once told me that song lyrics are a great thing to read, listen, and type when feeling kinda down...   Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry? I am the watch you always wear but you forget to wind.    -Guernica, Brand New   goodnite all...love and love abundantly, for that is what makes the world go round.

      sorry havent blogged in awhile. didnt have much to talk bout i guess. well im feeling kinda weird tonight. i was in a pretty good mood but feeling not so good. i just wish i was able to go back and change so many things in my life. everything would be different. completely. so many different relationships and so much more....oompf. lol i dunno i just feel that i havent been living up to my potential, and since i cant go back and change the past, i will have to go from here. now that i have someone who loves and cares for me so much more than i can explain on here, i feel that i have someone i should look after and get my act together for her sake. i need to grow up. and i hate it.  so looking for cars. awesome. anyone got any ideas? my dad is basically saying hey whatever you want, im open to letting you get it. so thats awesome, but....i dont really have a car i want. lol im such a dork. a nice gmc sierra would be stellar. with some steel weather guard storage bins in the back...oh man.

      gah. diarios. im getting rocked up the pooper. but oh well, life moves on! ive been thinking..yeah scary. i think im gonna start to meeting and hanging with more people. i guess ive kinda been inspired. Dan Beck is so great! i dont know how him and Nathanial do it. they seem to have it SO together its nuts. i wish i could totally just change right now. just a total 180, and get back on that right track. worship, praise, bible study, prayer, everything. i keep asking myself like...how could i be all about the faith for years, then just completely walk away? its amazing how far ive grown from my church family and God. it getting to be ridiculous. i would love to just hang with dan n nate and learn and grow with them, but i dont know how i would do it. i dunno, im clueless. and  im writing on here like a friggin girl.

      well what to say about today. hm. i get up, get ready to go to church, eat some breakfast and then head out. me and my bro obviously play air guitar and drums to all-american all the way to church...when he remembers that he forgot to remember the dvd. wow, cool kid. we turn around, go home and grab it, then go back. two blocks from the friggin church, me and my bro are boosting the lyrics to happy endings. what an awesome song! when all the sudden a nice white stratus pulls out n front of us. she blew the stop sign like it was just another road-side scenery. this is when i smash into her side and total my car. in a split second my life as i know it is changed. if me and my bro werent wearing our belts, we would have been munched. but anyway, i lost my bonnie, my cd player, and my small view of life. it can be stripped from you in a matter of seconds.

Thats how im feeling, its hard to explain. i have one hand, extreme joy for what may happen in my life in the upcoming months, and on the other : alot of regret, sadness, kind of a weakness deep inside of me? Can anyone explain, for all my readers of like three out there...But this journey of mine gets stranger and better every day. i'm so glad ive stayed away from things that could drag me down....im glad ive kept on my own less trodded path. stein auf.

      Hmmm...Alot on my mind right now...lets rehash:  -I get in a skirmish with some friends of mine on saturday [thats the reason for the solomon's wish song]  -Cara and Kyle are somewhat back together, we'll see how that goes.  -A certain someone loves talking with me and being my friend, you see where this is leading...   -I've recently (tonight, lol) have started my bible study and prayer life back up. This is tough issue for me, ive shyed away from the God-scene for awhile, but i'm interested into getting back into. We will have to see how it goes, any encourgement is for me is cool! ; )  - I need money! I really need a good idea for a small business to make some Mula this summer!  -Africa- I'm so pumped, how cool is it that i get to go to Africa this summer...for over TWO WEEKS! when i went to haiti, each time was just 11 days. I'm not sure how everything will go down but im excited for what God may reveal to me.  To tie this in, I've been really searching (more or less) for something meaningful and worthwhile in life. I've began to fill my time and efforts with knowledge. Wisdom and book-smarts to me are key. But after reading a tad big of Ecclesiates, one of the greatest books every written, its come to my attention that this longing for knowledge and wealth is ridiculous as Solomon stated:     I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!  I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.    Also he wrote later on in 2:15-16    Then I thought in my heart,   "The fate of the fool will overtake me also.  What then do I gain by being wise?"  I said in my heart,  "This too is meaningless."   For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered;  in days to come both will be forgotten.  Like the fool, the wise man too must die!    So my whole quest to learn and seek has been proven meaningless! How can this be? Well all humans have a desire to be accepted, to communicate and  find truth . Well this is a MAJOR post so im gonna rejuvenate and blog again later.

      So the feeling is shared. I would think that this feeling is so unique. Who could feel this way man? Actually, alot of people. non satisified. where is the adventure? what happened to taking life as it is, living for a purpose even? shattered like glass upon rock.   We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside  Somewhere we live inside  We were meant to live for so much more  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside   - Switchfoot, Meant to Live   But i luv being able to have escapes. many thanks to the people who take time out of their busy day, to stop and say hey, or randomly ask, how r you. you may not know the impact you have on someone until much much later.    thank you alison...

      Breaking at Dead-Ends   please stop this car and let me get out cause i don't like the looks of where you're headed you're telling me that you know the way by heart but i can't say i've ever seen you so lost  are you happy with all that you've been handed and are you tired of living life alone will you ever stop taking life for granted or will these dead-ended, one-way streets be your home?  you turn the music up so that you can hide yourself from the things you don't want to see you went so fast while life passed you by and now you're breaking at dead-ends

       Safe sex, the diaphram, lacking of your self-control. Diary, the top drawer, your mother wished she'd never seen. I just wanted to be loved she said. Its something that I never had.  Call him at three am, wishing to be reassured. He'd love to, of course he would, Anything to get you in his bed.   Goodnight she said, Im gonna start a revolution And you can be the star(t) of it, its in my head.  Footprints, and fallen leaves; these are the kind of things lovers think of.  Backseats and motels; these are the places that theyve been.  You want none of these things, these are the things that make us weak.   There went the world Just one girl  Number One Fan, There Went the World

      So i was up really late last night. doing crap. and i forgot to blog. this is a song by yellowcard, and i luv it alot. the chorus really sums up what i feel sometimes.    All that I needed to hear from you something of value but something untrue all that I wished that I'd find within you stings when I see all the ways that you took me for granted and told me its through picked from my pockets and smiled empty is nothing and nothing is you I think I'll just sit for awhile  All that I wished that I'd find with in you something of value something untrue

      Cara,  There isnt much i can say that you probably dont already know. of all the people i know and whom i luv, you one of the most special. i know we have our moments, and we will continue to...but i think we got it down that no matters how heated our arguements get...we will know that they will soon be over. i'm sorry for the way i act sometimes, my own selfishness and what not. i also am sorry for sometimes putting you in a position where you are in a corner...i dont know of anything more to say other than i luv you like a sister, and i want to be able to treat you like one if you let me. I hope this means something to you....actually i know it does.  Forever my love, -Benny J-

      And the picture frames are facing down and the riniging from this empty sound  is defeaning and keeping you from this sleep. And breathing is a foreign task  and thinkings just to much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.  This is incredible, Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well you'd like to think that your were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time? well this is the last time. This is the last time, This is the last time.

      need some inspiration. thought i would get some from a long arguementative conversation with a friend, but i didnt. eh kinda wishing people would just get along. kinda wishing people would grow up.  Had an excellent night tonight. I even missed curfew just because i was having such a good time. Cara and I have decided that going out and meeting new people would be sweet. Great place to do this? COPPER ROCK! Its great. I also love the music scene, i'm convinced one way to a person's heart is through music. the music that lives in them. and everyone.  ~benjamin.

      I'm feeling really great right now. Tyler and I had an awesome talk about everything. From Song of Songs, to thrifting. It great to be able to just relax and talk about things with people. its just an awesome feeling to be able to open up and just discuss things. To pray and read the bible and talk, without the need of parents or whoever to tell us what to look at or read or pray. it was all us. and thats how it should be.

      ugh. been awhile since i've posted something. well nothing much is new. had a great talk with sue last night in which we talked about some of the most random things we could talk about with eachother...eh...maybe it wasnt THAT random. but either way hilarious. i like to tab when i change thought processes. i think that will help people who read this  so now you see i'm going to talk aobut something else. which is...i uh dont really know.school was fun today, matt and i are gonna party this weekend and he is committed to the corruption and fall of ben julian. lol, not gonna happen.   thought about going to starbucks or the rock tonight, but i didnt. which i guess is good cause i definately dont have any money to blow on expensive chai or lattes. took riet home, didnt take brad, lol. poor guy.   hmmm....i think im done for now.

      hmmmmm. i do that alot. hmmmmmmmm is a good thing to say when you dont have much to say.   Falling   Everything i want, i need,  is everything you've given to me,  It's too much to comprehend,  Your whispers go unheard,  Like they're obscured.    This star that once burned bright,  Is falling hard tonight,  My destinations out of sight.  Cause this road's so long so long so long...    Everything you want from me,  I want to give to you,  But everything? I have no clue.  Tell me you're still here,  Let me know you care.    Anytime...this star burns(ed) bright,  Dont let it fall tonight,  My destinations stay in sight,  The road's still long,  It's all in this song.    Am i on track?  Well cut me no slack,  The road's not smooth,  I'll keep it on the move,  There is no time,  Well it's quarter to nine,  Nothing seemed right,  But i found you tonight...

It's hard to hold on when everything is saying "let go" But I'm so afraid that if I turn my back you won't be there You don't feel the same and your actions are telling me so You're driving off tonight and I just want you to know that I care

      the earth is beautiful.   i love how i feel when i'm out there in the open. swinging a camera, petting the dog, standing on a dirt road staring at an open expanse of just land and sky. everything feels so right and beautiful. i got one camera down, one more to go. the pictures were not too shabby, but not wonderful either. ah well, it was my first try.

      well i had quite the eventful day! i got myself ready for the day then picked up my cameras and took off out into the country side. my dad, brother, and i went around and stopped at a couple farms. i took plenty of pictures of good things and got the truck plenty dirty. ummm...some would call what we did off roading...thats all well and good in wisconsin...but here in kansas...thats the main road. pavement exists on the highways...not roads. make a long story short we proceeded to spend about 10 dollars worth of quarters washing the 6 inches worth of mud, caked between the wheel wells! it was awesome. oh, we also met the Babcock's Great Peranese(sp?) Snowball was her name. she was beautiful.

       Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimmed; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed; But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st; Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

       This is the end. This story's old But it goes on and on  Until we disappear. Calm me and let me taste The salt that you breathed While you were underneath. I am the one who haunts your dreams Of mountains sunk below the sea. I spoke the words but never Gave a thought to what they all could mean. I know that this is what you want. A funeral keeps both of us apart. You know that you are not alone. Need you like water in my lungs. This is the end.

      There are  3.2 million new cases  of aids in Africa this year, as well as  2.3 million deaths . i'm glad we as americans, no,  human beings , sit back and dont do anything to make a difference.   After watching 'Oprah in South Africa' in health class and discussing the epidemic with a Kenyan professor, i have decided that fighting the epidemic in Africa is a not necessarily a "calling" but more of an ambition. i would love to live, work and play in africa; to help the millions of orphans throughout the continent. and to bring comfort and love to the Hiv positive adults and children.   The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization.  Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882)

      'Cause these are the days worth livin' These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives Even if hope was shattered I know it wouldn't matter These are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives

      Mandy asked me tonight what my ambition was. i responded on the spot like this:  "to find true meaning in life and to leave my own mark on this world in any way shape or form. to be able to know that at my funeral, people that i had know and loved would be able to say nice good things about me and how i might have touched their life. because that is what life is about touching peoples lives, loving and being generous."  i believe this strongly, i'm trying to find myself in this big crazy world and i think i need to realize what is most important.
