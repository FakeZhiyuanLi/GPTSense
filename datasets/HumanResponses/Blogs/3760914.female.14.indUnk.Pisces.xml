      At this point in my life it feels like I'm going through so much. Like Idon't know who I am or where I belong. I also am feeling depressions and inner pain I never knew. I don't know why, it's not like my life is bad or anything. I full of nothing but a bunch of mixed emotions and just really upset. I dunno why...but well...who knows...

      my last year at junior high was the worst. i didn't enjoy it at all. people spreaded rumors about me and my friend terra. also people who i thought were my friends turned on me. i really hated it. also i lost my boyfriend i had for 8 months. i didn't get a part in drama, this fat girl that can't sing got the part i wanted! it was just a really bad year...
