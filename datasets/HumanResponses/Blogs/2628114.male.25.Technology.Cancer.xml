      Just a quick update of training today.  I went with Consuelo to the rec center for a reasonably hard workout.  The place was packed so I limited myself to the stairclimbers rather than wait in line for another machine.  I did a hard 20 minute climb totaling 133 floors (according to that machine).  I then did a slower 5 minute climb to cool down some.  I finished by doing a 15 minute session at 75% difficulty on the speedwork setting.  I always laugh at the warnings you will find on workout machines.  My favorite is probably "Stop immediately if you feel pain."  If this were true, the machine would never be used and people would never workout.  My quads and calves were burning by the end and my shirt was soaked so I know it was a great workout.  My legs, and especially knee, felt great.  I am unbelievably anxious to get back out running.  My knee feels like it could be ready.  I would have tried a quick 5 minute run on a treadmill tonight, but the machines were full with a line of people waiting.  We'll see what tomorrow holds.

      Well there are mysteries that are being made known daily.  It's the solutions to these mysteries that still evade me.  It seems that there truly is something backwards (literally) with my sister's elliptical.  Apparently, after some discussion with her last night, we both have experienced the machine cranking up to the hardest possible setting for no distinct reason.  The difficulty setting is somehow backwards so 1 is hardest and 10 is easiest.  This certainly made my workout last night much easier than expected.  I did 4 sets of 5and2s on the elliptical increasing (or so I thought!) the difficulty throughout.  When finished with that I moved on to a 12 minute session on the stair climber (real tough, that's why it was only 12 minutes).  I topped off the workout with a 10 minute workout on the rowing machine. Now, according to Runner's World, the rowing machine works every major muscle group.  This may be true, but the muscles I noticed the most were on my arse.  That's right, that machine kicked my butt, literally!  In reality, it worked the entire backside of my legs, it's just that those muscles stood out most of all while I was rowing.  Everything felt great though, I'm still very anxious about getting back out and running.  For the time, though, I don't mind the incredibly aerobic workout inside and the muscle definition that comes as a result.

      I obviously typed Sunday's update without realizing that if UC is closed, then all facilities are closed as well meaning I could not go to the rec center yesterday.  As luck would have it, my sister called and said that her elliptical machine was ready for use.    I went up to try it out Monday night.  The elliptical machine is sweet with all of the major functions of the machines at the rec center AND a fan to boot!  If only I could figure out how to use it.  Even though I worked out for about 35 minutes, I easily spent 10 of that fiddling with the controls and trying to figure out why the machine kept going to the hardest imaginable setting.  I did fully realize the benefit of using the arm controls along with the legs.  For the longest time, I always thought people were being sissies for using the arm things, but they totally work out your arms.  Once I finally figure out how to use that machine it will rock!  Since it wasn't that hardcore of a workout, all the body parts felt good and somewhat underused (except for the arms).  My knees continue to feel good as I continue to reduce swelling while feeding my ibuprofen addiction. :)  I still think I will hold on running until after my backpacking trip Feb 6-8.

      I got an unexpected opportunity to work out pretty hard on Sunday.  Lisa and I went over to the rec center with the intent to lift weights then use ellipticals, stair climbers, etc.  Instead of lifting weights, I went straight to the ellipticals to make up for not working out at all on Saturday (my intended long workout day).  I was able to do 3 sets of 5and2s before Lisa joined me.  I then did 2 more sets of 5and2s and then we moved to the stairclimbers for a 15 minute uphill.  According to that machine I went up 90 flights.  Could have fooled me, it felt like 300.  Everything felt great though, knee included.  I continue to pop the ibuprofen to keep the swelling down and the ellipticals really seem to be helping to strengthen my legs for when I go back to running.

      Back to the rec center for me Friday night.  Consuelo joined me and I continued on the girly machines but threw in some testosterone when I tried the stairclimber for 10 minutes.  After just 10 minutes, I have to give full credit to my brother-in-law, Brad, who exercises almost exclusively on those throughout the winter.  2 minutes got me sweating, 4 minutes and I was tired, and I thought minutes 5-10 would never come.  It may not have been the best for my knee, but it will certainly be a great advantage when I really want to train for hills.  I did a  5and2and5 on the ellipticals, then transferred to the stair climber, and finished with a 5and2 on some other technically advanced elliptical that surpasses the previous in coolness and effectiveness.  It allowed me to adjust the height of the front roller and in so doing adjust the muscles I was working.  Very cool and very helpful!  Gotta love those ellipticals!

      It was another spectacular day of ellipticals.  If I had the money, I would no doubt purchase one.  I did 5 sets of 5and2 plus a 5 to finish.  (For simple translation, see Webster's.  For difficult translation, read mine.  5and2 = 5 mins forward, 2 mins backward, 5 to finish = Do you really need a translation for this one?)  My legs and knee felt great especially as I kicked up the difficulty throughout the workout.  I finished on the level 12 (of 20) and just for fun did the last minute on 15.    Even after the workout, my knee felt great.  It has acted up a little today, but I am working to be diligent to ice it regularly.  No matter how good my knee may feel in the coming days and weeks, I still plan on staying on the ellipticals for another two weeks to continue to strengthen my legs.  I will also start (probably Friday) to do stair climbers in conjunction with ellipticals so I can get some hillwork done.  I will slowly work back into running (knee pain dependent) the week of 2/9 after my Red River Gorge trip.  That trip will as good a test as any to determine if my knee truly has recuperated and if my legs have strengthened.

      The new love in my life has been found.  Elliptical is its name and it has given a needed boost in enthusiasm for training.  On a whim, I decided to go to the UC rec center to try these magical elliptical machines.  Justin was already going so I met him there.    My knee had been acting up all day and it was to the point of feeling like it had an air bubble in there or something (very annoying).  I was aggravated from last night and this air bubble feeling annoyed me even more.  Either way, I was still anxious to see how these ellipticals would work out.  When I got there, I found out when the rest of UC students workout since virtually every machine was taken.  I began my stretches and saw some people I knew.  I was so anxious to make up for missing last night that, though I did stretch, I didn't completely stretch.  I headed downstairs to the machines.  I sucked up my pride and took the last available elliptical since every other machine was taken by girls (this isn't a bad thing girls, but it looks a little odd when you are one guy among 10 girls working out).    I began the workout and had already decided that in order to work out both sides of my legs, I would go forward and backward.  I went forward for 5 minutes then backward for 2.  It took me a solid 3 minutes to figure out the stupid controls on the machine but I still used my watch for timing.  The magic came for me when I was able to break a sweat, work out my legs, and not further injure my knee.    I can actually say that after my 30+ minute workout, where I traveled approximately 3 miles (according to that stupid computer control), my knee felt great.  No pain.  I am certain I will be sore after how hard I worked my legs, but I would rather be sore than injured.  I will monitor it very closely tomorrow, but I can initially say that my knee pain has subsided.  I am confident those machines will help to strengthen my legs so I can return to running.

      After my wonderfully exciting, motivating, and refreshing 60 on Saturday on that cursed treadmill I was left with shin splints and a dull ache on the outside of my right knee.  Futilely thinking that a day and a half of rest would correct any of that ache I felt, I went back to running tonight.  My intent was to complete a 30 in the glorious cold.  I made it a whopping 3 minutes before I had to stop or hurt myself worse.  All totaled, my run/walk tonight lasted 7 minutes and left me clamoring for cross training alternatives that I could do while my knee heals again!  The beauty of being in college and having well-to-do siblings is you have many alternatives.  I am now forced to alter my schedule (just daily schedule, not training schedule) so that I can work out either at the rec center or my sister's house.  It's not too big of a deal, just a hassle.  I really stinkin' want to run! outside!

      Well I ran a 60 today on my Mom's treadmill.  I don't feel like writing a narrative today.  I will explain the run in the following statements:  Running inside on a treadmill sucks.  Shin splints suck just as much.  Running inside is about 800 times hotter than running outside.  I was 10 times more distracted indoors than out.  Motivation was down drastically because of running indoors and not feeling like getting anywhere.  I've been having really annoying cramps in my legs since the run even though I thoroughly stretched before and after.  I'm officially committed to the Pig after signing up today for the run and my chip (>$90)  Yada yada yada

      It's another gorgeous day outside and I wish that my body felt as good as it did yesterday.  I ran a fast 20 today which included quite a few times to walk since I apparently was running much faster than I realized.  I was running so fast today that I had to alter my course multiple times just so I would not end up at home before the run was over.  I probably ran around 2.5 miles today, maybe more.  The slight ache I felt yesterday in my right shin was present throughout my run today.  I will taking ibuprofen and resting throughout the day today and tomorrow in hopes it subsides in time for my 60 on Saturday.  I will still consider it a good run.  I am finding I can tolerate minor cramps or aches in my abdomen a little better without having to always slow to a walk.  That's all for today's run, now it's time to look forward to my 60 on Saturday!

      What an absolutely spectacular day!  Also, what a difference from Monday.  The wind finally died down so I was able to run my favorite route today down Madison.  I felt phenomenally better than I did Monday, I temperature was perfect for the amount of clothes I wore, and there are no little old ladies lying in the street somewhere because of me.  I ran a 40 today with two 1-minute pickups in the middle.  The course was deceptively hilly which left me breathless a couple times, but it is such a change from the hilly treachery of Eden Park.  I even saw deer today on my run.  My body felt great throughout the run and the only thing I would note is a little tenderness, which I still feel know, in my shins.  I will do my best to rest everything today in preparation for my shorter, but much faster, 20 tomorrow.

      Oh yeah, did I mention how unbelievably hot it was today too since I wore WAY too many clothes?  Yeah, all around good day if you consider the wind and heat.  Fortunately the fact my legs feel great offsets most of this.  Okay enough for the day!

      Just a quick update for today.  I ran a quick 30 today with three stops for 1 minute of walking each.  Having to stop and walk is beginning to bug me since I feel like I should be running the whole time.  It makes me cry a little, but I usually find a little old lady to mug and/or beat up and I'm fine.  I am beginning to realize my Monday runs will probably consistently be the hardest.  My body did not want to get up today and when it finally did, I realized I am still a little sore from the Saturday 50.  Also, I really wish the wind would shift since I have been forced to run down into Eden Park every day which is nothing more than hilly treachery.  Speaking of wind, why the heck is it that I can be running northeast into the wind when the wind is coming out the southwest?!  Needless to say, I was fighting the wind for about 80% of the run today regardless of which direction I ran.  Once my legs got warmed up they felt great throughout the run.  It was the rest of my body that forced me to stop and walk up some of the more treacherous hills of Eden Park and the surrounding area.  I was able to run the extra three minutes I lost when I stopped to walk, but that poor, old lady is probably still lying on the sidewalk.  :)

      I just wanted to quickly update you on my run today with Lisa.  We ran a 50 today at a local track covered in snow.  I am certain the change in terrain helped me and my legs.  I don't feel sore at all and after running, Lisa and I could have run even longer.  We ran at an almost exact 10-min/mile pace putting us right at 5 miles.  At that pace, we would finish the marathon in 4:20. We ran (and I mean ran!) one more 400 just for fun.  We both continued to realize the benefits of running the long runs with somebody else so I will be hunting someone down to run a 60 with me next weekend.  :)  That's just about all for me until Monday when I will come back with a 30.  Have a great weekend!  I hope your long run this weekend goes/went well!

      I ran a brisk 20 today.  Everything felt great.  All I noticed was a little tenderness on the outside of my ankles.  This has cropped up recently since I have gotten those arch supports.  I had to stop and walk twice today after two treacherous hills where I was probably running faster than I should have been.  I finished the run with a 2-block pickup which really pushed my limits at the end of the run.  I start this week with a 2-block and continue next Friday with a 3-block, etc.  Other than that, I will be taking tomorrow off to rest and prepare for the 50 on Saturday.

      Whew!  What a cold one today!  Fortunately my backpacking experience has given me valuable knowledge about what to wear, even in zero degree wind chill.  I ran a 30 today with 1 minute of pickup and a whole lot of hills.  I had to stop to walk twice for one minute each and one other time to fiddle with my stupid mp3 player (dang thing never worked right all morning).  Beyond that, my legs and everything felt great.  I am certain I will be a little sore after my 1 minute pickup today but probably not too  bad.  The arch supports seem to really be helping, hopefully.  ;)

      The cold weather returned this week I noticed as I completed my 50 today.  I've begun to dislike the first 10 minutes of every morning run.  My body is still confused about why it is up at that time torturing itself and it takes about that long for it to wake up.  All in all, ignoring a few aches in my calves, the run was really good today.  I realized how much I love running in East Walnut Hills/O'Bryonville/Hyde Park.  I got to go down Madison, down Grandin, down some wonderfully (that's right, I said wonderfully!) hilly road that I forget the name of, up Observatory, and back on Madison.  I probably went just over 5 miles in that time frame.  It felt like I was going at about a 9 minute pace.**  With a mile left in the run I sped up to approximately an 8 minute pace and with a quarter mile to go I sped up to a 7 minute pace.**  I am greatly encouraged to feel that good at the end of the run to be able to speed up as much as I did.  It is also just as encouraging to kick Madison Road's butt as I sped right up it in the end of my run.  I didn't see no stinkin' hill!  Alright enough before I get any weirder for the night.    ** All times and speeds are approximate and cannot be used in a court of law.

      I completed another cross training session last night that ripped my quads to shreds and tested my gluts yet again on the rowing machine.  I journeyed again to the unsuspecting, and out of town I might add, Zappin household.  I completed a 5 minute warmup on the ever-backwards elliptical machine then continued on one of the most gruelling 40 minutes sessions ever on the stair climber.  I finished with 15 minutes of rowing which was a good cooldown after that stair climber incident.  Besides a little soreness today, I feel great even after the long run Saturday and the gruelling workout last night.

      What an amazing difference from just two days ago!  I completed my long run today with Lisa and Natalie and everything feels great.  We completed 11 or more miles today that included the most treacherous hill (in my opinion) in Clifton, Straight Street hill.  We did all this in just under 2 hours too!  (Approximately 110 minutes for those keeping score at home.)  If you are unaware of this hill, it's a half mile hill at about a 40 or 45 degree incline.  To begin and end on that hill (downhill and uphill respectively) was both gruelling and victorious.  We ran from the Brick House down Straight St. to Central Parkway then made our way to Spring Grove Cemetery.  Best guess, we ran about 4 miles inside of Spring Grove which is absolutely awesome!  I've heard many people say many good things about Spring Grove, but it was helpful to experience it on my own.  I never knew a cemetery could be that big!  Either way, we did stop for a quick restroom/water/stretch break in Spring Grove before we headed back the way we came.  The difference between this week and last is almost night and day.  I could have kept running today without much of a problem.  By the same time last week, my lower legs may not have allowed me to go further without me injuring something.  All in all, it's totally cool to break that 10 mile mark, almost break the 2 hour mark, and run (that's right, run!  no stopping for site-seeing on this tour!) Straight Street hill.

      I've heard most long-time runners say to me that some days you simply don't have it.  Today was that day for me which is depressing considering the weather.  With the combination of stress, sleep deprivation, and residual knee and lower leg pain this run was not much good at all.  I would still have to classify my "after drinking a pitcher of beer" morning run as the worst so at least there are some standards.  The run started out somewhat bad as I struggled to find a good pace or rhythm or something.  I stopped for frequent walks (5-6 in all) as my body just wasn't feeling it today.  I probably completed 40 of my planned 45 just with a lot of walking and low motivation.  Even though it wasn't the best run today, there were still things to learn.  For starters, as hilly treacherier as Eden Park and Mt. Adams are, they are sweet runs with all sorts of fun options.  Secondly, for those who use mp3 players or radios on runs, if you are ever listening to show tunes with dialog from the show, try not to mistake the voices on the song with real people and almost step off a curb or run into a sign.  Not to say that any of that happened?  I think that's all for the update today.

      Since it has been a few days, I figured I'll catch everyone up to speed with a quick post tonight about the last two workouts before I pass out for the night.    I postponed my Monday run to the evening for one reason or another.  (Sorry, when it's this late and I've been doing software design for the past 3 days, my mind kind of goes.)  I also cut my run back in the anticipation of a spontaneous Tuesday speed and hill workout with a no-show-Mark and Consuelo.  Either way, I actually only ran for about 20 minutes on Monday.  Only a runner will understand why I cut my run that short so the only thing I will say is that everything was fine and I am learning the limits of my body more everyday.  I do remember my calves and shins still hurting a fair amount on my run, but it wasn't debilitating by any stretch of the imagination.  On Tuesday night, I met Consuelo at the indoor track at UC for some planned speedwork.  Since I didn't hear from Mark (who had the original idea for speedwork), Consuelo and I kind of made up our own speed workout.  We ran (and I mean ran!) 4 sets of 400m with a walking 200m in between each set.  We started way too fast and soon learned that sprinting would only wear us out.  We set a good pace on the second and third sets and I got to watch Consuelo test his physical limits as he sprinted the last 200m of our final 400m set.  Truth be told, my shins and calves were seizing up dramatically after each set.  My lower legs hurt the worst on Tuesday after those 400m sets.  Regardless of the pain, I moved on in my workout to my hillwork (or stairwork?) on the stairclimbers.  Consuelo joined me for about 15 minutes but I continued on for 30 minutes on the stairclimber.  My lower legs hurt, as usual, at first but the pain began to subside as I climbed further up flights of stairs (188 in all).  By the end of the workout, the pain was back to a dull ache that I have felt in the past week or so after runs.    Since then, I have stayed on the ibuprofen to reduce the swelling.  It seems to have improved things.  I will still probably maintain my distance and medium runs during the week but I might swap my other runs with cross training on the ellipticals and stair climber and all that jazz.  We'll see.

      saturday Saturday SATURDAY!  A day that will live in my mind for the next 4 hours.  This post really isn't completely necessary for my training friends (since most endured the run today with me today).  This post is more for my friends and family who fit into one or more of the following categories: 1. Were not on the run with me today.  2. Are not training for the marathon.  3. Laugh at those who do.  We completed a 9-10 mile run today through the lovely, busy streets of Wyoming and the surrounding areas.  According to Natalie we covered those miles in 1hr45minutes.  In the harder parts of the run, it felt more like 6 weeks.  The 5 miler Friday with Brad really was a good warmup to this run today.  My legs warmed up much faster and except for the same shin and knee pain, my legs felt great.  Even my knee (IT band at least) felt great.  I did notice some dull aching near the end of the run right on the kneecap and the surrounding areas, but nothing that worried (I just ran 10 stupid miles!  What do you want?!  Sheesh!).  The run got really hard for me on the downhill (odd isn't it?) on Compton and right near the end where I decided to chase after Consuelo who had broken away from the pack.  I haven't felt any tremendously bad side effects from the run at all and except for being tremendously hungry, my body feels pretty good.

      Tonight was a spontaneous run with the self-proclaimed, "slow runner" Brad.  I went to Heather and Brad's house to interfere and force them to serve me.  This was not before I made Brad drive me to the Mason Rec Center, lie and pay for me to get in, and run with me.  According to him I ran close to 5 miles on some cushy, indoor track.  Since I have a little more elaborate stretching routine than Brad, he was able to start before me and get a little more distance in.  All in all, it was a good run which served as a good warmup to the Saturday run.  I continue to feel soreness or aching in my shins and calves but it's not the pain similar to my past knee injuries.  Other than that, my legs feel good and my knee pain has all but subsided.

      Bring on any 5 or 10K folks because I just finished one today.  I completed a glassesless 60 minute run today.  This was an accomplishment in that it was the longest outdoor run I have completed.  Glasses didn't matter so much as good ankles did.  Is anyone else really anxious for this garbage on the sidewalks to melt?!  After sliding across the sheets of ice, I fought my way through the Rocky Mountain models (as Consuelo so affectionately calls them).  All in all the run was great.  My legs felt tremendous considering the length of the run.  I did feel (and still do feel) some aching in my shins and calves.  Throughout the run, I felt some tension in my knee, but nothing that caused me to have to stop.  I ended up running all the way to Hyde Park Square and back, mostly along Madison.  I've never clocked it in my car, but with all the side streets the run included I would guess the run was just over 6 miles.

      For not being a morning person, I absolutely love getting up early in the morning to run!  That's right faithful (or forced?) listeners, I got to run again today!  I ran a 40 today beginning in the hilly treachery of Eden Park and extending to the hillier (that's a word) treacherier (so is that) of Mt. Adams.  I fought my way through the hills and ice mines of the sidewalks to complete my run today.  My muscles were still a little sore from the hammering they received on the backpacking trip this past weekend but everything felt great besides that.  I felt a little tension in my knee in the beginning, but it soon passed as my legs warmed up.  I felt so good by the end of the run, I could have continued for another 40 without much of a problem (maybe?).  I love running for a few reasons, but one main thing is that I never cease learning things on my runs.  Here are a few things I learned today on my run.  I learned that the wind will fight me no matter the direction I run.  I also learned that ice is a harder surface on which to run than asphalt (ouch my ankles!).  Wheee!  I love running!

      I scaled back my workout last night a little bit due to unsettled Indian food and the opportunity for ice cream (yay  for soft serve!).  I did an intense 20 minute climb on the stairclimber that left my legs screaming like a scared, little girl and me with the realization I should probably relax today since I've been going pretty hard in past week.  I set the machine on the strength/speed setting at just about the highest difficulty level.  Throughout the workout, my body was going through ache checks of each part of my leg.  Despite the screaming, my legs felt good and my kneed continues to feel normal (which is a good thing).  I haven't tried any hill training with running, but I am pretty sure that it won't be that bad now that I have experienced consistent workouts on the stairclimber.  Bring on the hilly treachery that is Eden Park!

      Back to saving time since I'm tired and have to be at work early again tomorrow.  I will discuss the last two workouts in this update since they were very similar.  2/2/04 Originally I had planned on dropping in at Heather and Brad's house for the elliptical-stairclimber-rowing machine workout of which I've grown fond, but I ended up going to the rec center at UC again.  It was packed so I just went with the stairclimber for an amazingly intense 25 minute uphill climb.  The machine said I did 163 floors and about 3.3 miles and I could believe it.  I did it on setting 14 (of 20) and on the aerobic setting which gave a lot of variety up and down intensity.  My legs (especially quads) were on fire by the time I was done so after the fire department came, I stretched and went on about my business.  2/3/04 Even though it was the Crosstown Shootout tonight, it was playing at the rec center so I wasn't completely deprived of watching UC fight back and forth with XU only to lose in the end (so sad).  I actually did a more intense workout tonight with 30 minutes on the stairclimber on the speed setting and 10 minutes on the rowing machine on the highest level.  My legs (and knee which is great!) actually felt better tonight than last for some unexplained reason.    Overall, I have been off of constant ibuprofen since Sunday (which is awesome) and I feel like I could run 5+ miles after every workout.  I am a little concerned about jumping back into my relatively high-mile running schedule but I am confident I will have the stamina to do it.  I am mostly concerned that my knee(s) will be able to take it.

      I will discuss my past two workouts in this one to save some time.  Well I continued on with another tortuous (quad-wise) cross training session on Friday, 1/30/04 at my unsuspecting sister and brother-in-law's house.  I completed 21 minutes (3 5and2s) on the elliptical to start which left my quads burning, but I followed that by an intense speedwork session on the stairclimber.  I finished with the rowing machine, which I am happy to announce that despite the machine being a pain in my butt (literally), I was able to complete 10 full minutes without stopping.  As desperately as I want to run, it was nice to workout indoors with the wind chills below zero as they were.  Everything felt great and I was very excited to have a another workout of burning muscles and a soaked t-shirt.  My knee and legs feels great.  I am certain the consistent ibuprofen has helped with the healing.    Now, on to the best news of all!  Due to my semi-spontaneous trip up north, my training schedule was a little thrown off with sleep deprivation and random silliness.  Either way, after our fraternity football event at Ohio Northern University, I got the yearning to run.  My knee felt fine in spite of the cold so I decided to give it a try.  I started incredibly slowly since the ground was covered in ice mines, it was pretty cold, and I still wasn't sure my knee could handle it.  I was overjoyed to find that my knee was fine.  I was able to complete a 30 minute run with no aches or pain.  True, it was not the 60 minute run or long workout that I needed to complete for training, but it was a success in my own mind now that I am able to continue running.  This brings the word of the week full circle since I was "stoked" about being able to run.

      Long time no posty! I know, I know.  This is what I get for leaving town for more than a week.  Since my last post, I have been able to do two runs due to strenuous physical labor being done last week and lack of time.  Update for 3/24/04 This was the only run I got to do in South Chicago.  Me and another guy who was staying up there journeyed to a little safer neighborhood to run.  We ended up running at a high school track along with the varsity and junior track teams.  We enjoyed running with them while receiving comments like, "Run white boy run" and "You runnin' too fast white boy".  I ran just under 7 miles in 60 minutes.  It was hard since my body was tired with all the work we were doing last week.  Nonetheless, it was good to run and it was a good workout.  Update for 3/28/04 I got to run in my first race today as I participated in the Heart Mini-Marathon with Natalie and Lisa.  There were many factors that led to me not feeling so well on the course including sickness, exhaustion, heat, and lack of running most of last week.  Either way, I finished a little bit below half of the pack at just under 1 hour 30 minutes.  My official results read on the  urlLink website  (www.heartmini.org) as  1582 Tyler Woebkenberg  M  24 CINCINNAT OH 1:27:50  9:27  63/93   M1924   1149/2088 M. I would say that it stands for me finishing as #1582 (out of 3661), my name, my gender, my age, where I'm from, my time, my split time, my place in my group, my group (male 19-24), and my place compared to all males in the 15K.  All in all, it was an awesome day to run, it was great practice at a real race, and I don't regret it despite how bad I felt at some points on the course.  My legs felt great despite not running much in the last week and the only thing holding me back was my head cold.  I was able to finish incredibly strong at an almost sprint pace which helped me to make up the 5 minutes I spent walking.  5 more weeks until the marathon!

      Well they don't call it the Windy City for nothing!  (Actually, according to Jeff, Chicago was not named for its wind but its windy-mouthed politicians.)  After driving up to visit the family in Chicago, I sort of ran a 50 yesterday.  Between the 15-20 mph winds (with gusts of 40), my physically exhausted body, the mentally challenging course, and drop in temperature my run yesterday just stunk.  I was already tired from a lack of sleep in the previous two nights.  The wind was ridiculous.  There really were times when I would be stopped in my tracks because of the wind.  The course was some insane, flat, straight path that was mentally impossible to conquer.  There is not much good I can say about yesterday's run except the fact that I get to see my sister, brother-in-law, and beautiful niece before and the run (who I usually don't get to see).

      I got back to running again last night with a wonderful feeling 55-60 minute run.  My plan was to run to UC and do Yassos on the outdoor track only to find out that it has been reduced to a heap of mud.  What I ended up doing was running to the fraternity house, watching basketball and visiting for 5 minutes, and running back to my house.  I ran west on Taft which elicited many odd looks as I ran through the 'hood in shorts and ran back on MLK which elicited a few less odd looks.  Possibly my favorite part of the run was scaring some large black man half to death as I whipped right by him.  I was hardly making a sound running, he didn't see me coming, and I was past him by the time he was able to cry out in shock of seeing me run by.  I heard him behind me saying, "Boy!  I didn't even see that guy!" to his friend.  The run felt awesome.  I wore the knockaround shoes from Brad with the Betty Crocker insoles.  They are lighter and roll better than my other shoes, but they are smaller which caused some tender areas on my feet after that long of a run.  Other than that, my shin splint pain has all but subsided to a dull ache every now and then and my calves are still a little sore.

      Something about the snow or something yesterday sparked a fire in me to run.  My shin splint pain was reduced to a point I could run without much pain so I took off on a 50-60 minute run last night.  I got to run what is becoming one of my favorite courses in my area.  Madison to Grandin to Erie to Observatory to Madison  The weather was great last night except for the occasional artic wind that would come and slow my progress up hills.  My body went through its usual ache checks and nothing seemed out of place or to be hurting too much.  There was a constant dull ache in my right shin but it was not something that got significantly worse as I ran.  Actually, to Brad's credit, it did begin to feel a little better once it got warmed up and stretched out more around miles 2 and 3.  My legs still are not cheerful about downhills, but we're getting there.

      Alright, so I'm really behind this week but I got stinkin' shin splints, what do you want?!  That's right my faithful readers, I have conceded that I got a horrible case of shin splints and not some muscle pull.  Of course this concession came after quite a few people telling me I had shin splints and me finally listening.  It's not all bad though.  I still have the ability to cross train which I was able to do on Wednesday night.  I did relatively hard workout which included 4 sets of 5&2s on the elliptical and 15 minutes on the rowing machine.  I got to remember how difficult the elliptical really could be and burn up my quads again without inflaming my shin splints any more.  Not too much else to report for now.

      I'm a little behind due to a horrendous schedule and a trip out of town. Not too much to report except that I was able to run 12 miles on Saturday through lovely Mayberry.  I would be a lot more excited about it if I hadn't pulled some muscle next to my shin that prevents me from running right now.  I'm back on the reserve list meaning I have to fight woo girls off the ellipticals at the Rec or use the backward machine at Heather and Brad's.  My muscle has been showing signs of improvement with a consistent diet of ibuprofen, but in an attempt to run on it this morning, the pain proved otherwise.

      As I start today, I am combining days again since the two workouts fall so close together.  On a brief note to the immediate family, the stopwatch is back in action from all those years ago (have those batteries ever been changed?).  Update for 3/3/04 I proceeded to the Princeton High School track after work to do the Yasso 800s (Y800).  For clarification of what a Y800 is, see my previous update.  I warmed up with a mile on the track to get my legs going.  To me, even in spite of the rain, it was a perfect night to run.  It was perfect expect for some lower leg pain mainly focused on my calves but also leaking to my shins and knees a bit.  My leg pain was annoying for the first two Y800s but subsided pretty dramatically after the last two and after stretching in the end.  I completed four sets of Y800.  My times were 4:15, 4:13, 4:05, and 3:36.  I have no idea what happened to me on the last one, but it brought my average to 4:02.  These numbers were very exciting to me for two reasons:  1. Negative splits  2. If these truly are an accurate estimate of what my marathon time will be, then I will have surpassed the self-proclaimed slow runner Brad who will answer my shots at him about slow running with comments like, "Go and beat a 4:05 and then we'll talk."  :)  I finished with a 400m walk to cool down.  It was a great night all-in-all.  Update for 3/4/04 I went back to the Rec this morning and I am happy to report that my workout was great and no one dropped a weight set on my foot.  I have also learned that the devoted worker-outers come in the morning.  There was no makeup, but there was plenty of sweat.  I did 45 minutes on the stair climber again on level 14 totaling 293 floors (just can't beat that 300 floor mark!).  The stairclimber was a good workout, but it might be time to up the intensity level or duration.  I finished with 15 minutes on the rowing machine.  It's always kind of odd rowing next to someone because you will almost always subconsciously fall into the same rhythm as the person.  Kind of weird but cool all at the same time, especially when you realize this and you intentionally vary your speed to throw off the other person's rhythm.

      Well I'm sure my absence of updating in a while indicates one of two things to you:  either I've been abducted by evil people who abduct tall, lanky, sarcastic people like me or I am drowning with the amount of work I have to accomplish before quarter end.  Either way, I have been able to continue running and working out, just not posting.  Since my last update I have gone 4 times which I will discuss below beginning with the most recent first.  3/1/04 I went with Consuelo to the Rec Center at UC to do stairs and rowing machine.  Apparently this is not what these not-so-bright individuals had in mind for me.  Instead of completing 45 minutes on the stairclimber and 15 on the rower, I completed 15 minutes on the stair climber, had a weight set dropped on my ankle/foot, and completed 30 more minutes on the stair climber.  That's right, I said I had a weight set dropped on me!  Right as I got to the 15 minute mark I heard a weird sound then a sharp pain on the outside of my right ankle and foot.  The not-so-bright individuals responsible for this were standing behind me wide-eyed and apologetic for their "not-so-brightness."  One of them was still holding the stupid pin from the the equipment that hit me!  Fortunately, I was hardly hit by this piece of metal and I was able to continue my workout on a machine far from the "Not-So-brightest."  I actually didn't even bleed as a result of the accident but I was still a little perturbed.  Good workout overall though.  Consuelo and I decided to run back from the Rec Center at a faster than normal pace which really did test us both.  It was a lot of fun though to run across UC and through some of the buildings.  (Don't worry, the rest of the posts for won't be quite as long.  I just had to explain the "Not-So-Brights")  2/28/04 I completed a 40-50 minute run tonight.  I had a goal that I wanted to make it to the river from my house.  I set out through Eden Park, down and through Mt. Adams, and all the way to the P&G Pavilion.  The run was great and something that could be extended for anyone interested in a longer run from here and through downtown and all.  As long as whoever that is has a healthy respect for hills.  My run was moderately hilly in the first and last quarter, but ridiculously downhilly (that's a word) the second quarter, and treacherously uphilly the third quarter.  The temperature was flat out perfect.  I set out right at sunset at approximately 55 degrees.  By the time I finished running, it had dropped to about 48 degrees which was perfect for me.  My body felt great and was overjoyed to be done with those hills in Mt. Adams.  2/27/04 I completed 40-50 minutes tonight with the self-proclaimed slow runner Brad.  We actually ran outside this time through the lovely town of Mayberry, err...  Loveland.  We ran down the hill to some part of downtown Loveland and partially on the bike trail.  Tonight was my first night running any significant distance in shoes other than my running shoes.  Since Brad has run so long, he has like 43 pairs of running shoes with insoles to fit any foot's need.  Brad let me keep the shoes in which I ran, including the Betty Crocker insoles (just bake 'em at 200 for 3 minutes!) for which I am greatly appreciative.  They will make wonderful backup shoes in case (similar to tonight) I don't have my primary running stuff with me and I want to run.  2/26/04 (Seriously, last one for today!) I went back to the Rec Center tonight in order to border my long run (or two medium runs) with cross training.  It is very obvious that spring break is coming soon based on the amount of makeup and lack of sweat present at the Rec.  I completed 45 minutes on the stair climber, level 14, 292 floors, and who knows how many "miles."  I then finished on the rowing machine for 15 hard minutes where I kept the rhythm right at 30 rows/minute.  Very intense which forced a break midway.  My body felt great and ready for the weekend run(s).

      We're back tonight with two for one.  Don't worry, I'll make it as short as I can so I can get some rest.  Update for 4/26/04 I ran at least 6 glorious miles tonight over 55 minutes.  I wore the shoes of yellow majesty and they carried me along effortlessly as I ran.  After no ability to run this past weekend due to lack of time or work emergencies, my body was itching to get back out there.  I ran along one of my favorite routes down Madison, Grandin, Erie to Hyde Park Square, whatever that road is, Madison, Woodburn to home.  I started mildly slow and picked it up as usual.  I warmed up and stretched out during the run and felt so good, I still have trouble believing my speed in the end.  To give you some perspective for how fast I was going, my feet were landing in perfect time to The Twist by Chubby Checker.  If I had to guess, I was going just below 8 minute pace but with very little effort.  Update for 4/28/04 I don't know how to explain tonight's run.  It was good and bad, tiring and fulfilling, difficult and easy all at the same time.  I guess my body was just tired or something.  I only ran 30 minutes and the first half was a complete dichotomy from the second half.  The first half was sluggish and exhausting as I plodded along.  The second half was like normal where I could just run without much effort and I was going at a faster pace.  I don't really know how else to explain it beyond that.  My body felt good for the most part.  My knee pain has subsided to the point I can go 26 miles without fear of hurting anything.  Being one of my last runs, it was a good indicator that I have to get back onto a normal sleep schedule and get some more rest before this thing goes down.  Other than that, it was all good as I wound through Eden Park.

      So I'm a little behind but at least it's not a double post again!  Update for 4/23/04 I got to do a 30 minute run tonight in Franklin just before I watched our poor company softball team lose again.  I learned a couple things about Franklin and running in Franklin.  Apparently people in Franklin don't take too kindly to outsiders and runners, of which I was both.  With that said, there seemed to be no end to an odd stream rednecks in Mustangs yelling such pithy, original sayings as, "Run faster boy!" "Wanna lift, your going awful slow?" "Run Forest Run!" and the obligatory "Woohoo!" (yelled by redneck girls as they drove by).  These statements, combined with knee soreness that has escalated in my mind to "concerning, gave me a lesser view of two groups of people:  1) People from Franklin.  2) People in Mustangs.  (Sorry if anyone on this list fits into those categories, but you can blame the white trash that was yelling out their windows at me on Friday)  All in all, the run was good.  I monitored my knee pain/soreness throughout the run.  It didn't get worse but didn't get much better.  Most of Franklin was flat, but there is one hill and I took a random turn down a road to end up running up the worst part of it.  I say worst part, but the stairclimber training helped me to kick that hill's butt!

      Can't seem to break this double update thing, can I?  Here are my most recent updates from 4/20 & 4/22.  Update for 4/20/04 I took off on a run that lasted a little over 30 minutes tonight.  I went down the very familiar path of winding through the streets of East Walnut Hills, down Madison, but tonight I decided to conquer the hills of Taft after hearing good reports from Lisa.  I turned right down Torrence, went to the bottom, turned right on Taft, and ultimately turned left on McMillan (which was no better for hills).  The run was eerie to say the least.  I ran around 11p.m. and at that time, there's nobody out in the areas in which I ran.  Torrence was probably the eeriest place to go since it was surrounded on both sides by dark, wooded areas.  It was cool though.  My body felt fine and the run was good except for the La-La Land feeling I had the entire run.  My head just felt like it was in the clouds for most of the run except near the end when the hills got pretty tough.  I didn't have to stop at all throughout the run and it was a great way to get a good night's sleep since my body was tired after that.    Update for 4/22/04 With the threat of torrential rain, I wimped out tonight and went to the Fieldhouse (FH) at UC.  My original intent was to run a little and do some Yasso 800's and the FH provided a good place to do it.  The workout was spectacular and highly encouraging.  Anyone who would argue that I haven't gained speed should compare my times from last night to the first time I did Y800s.  My times last night were 3:28, 3:27, 3:23, 3:22, and 3:13 in that order with an average time of 3:22.6 for 800 meters.  At that rate, the Y800 theory estimates that I could run a 3:22.6 marathon in my current physical condition.  That's hard to believe but it's awesome to me to think I was sustaining a 7 min/mile (or better) pace for the Y800s last night.  I started and finished the night with a mile run at about 9 min/mile so all totaled, I completed 5 miles with running, Y800s, and walking.  My body felt great and I could have done 5 more Y800s but I had to stop to stick to my wind-down period for training (and CSI was coming on!).  The only thing I have noticed thus far is a little tenderness in my left knee.  It's a little concerning but could have been caused by a little less stretching that I did last night or my body just responding to speedwork.

      Two posts for one cost again today.  For some reason, last week was horribly busy and left little time or energy for running.  I was able to get back on track, somewhat, on Saturday and Sunday.  Update for 4/17/04 After working in the glorious weather most of the morning and avoiding running most of the afternoon, I took off with Paulie the roommate on a planned 30 minute run.  Unfortunately, Paul's lack of running for 5 years slowed us a little, which was fine, and we ended up completing about 20 minutes at a slower pace.  This was fine, I just needed to get my legs back into running.  Even though it was a short, slower run, I still noticed some slight pain in my knees and shins (not shin splints but further up).  Kind of odd, but it was good to get out right at dusk like that.  Update for 4/18/04 Knowing full well that I couldn't avoid running or give up just yet, I went on a 10+ mile run today through Mt. Adams and Eden Park and Cincinnati and Newport.  I kind of ran anywhere and everywhere that I wanted.  About midway through I got it in my head that I wanted to cover the hardest part of the marathon course (miles 6-8, up Reading and Gilbert and through Eden Park back to my house).  This section lived up to my expectations in every way and I am not looking forward to it on marathon day.  I fought mildly annoying cramps for the first half of my run and thirst, exhaustion, and heat the second half of my run.  I had my utility belt on and sipped water throughout the run but that didn't seem to help my extreme dehydration.  I also had two GUs about midway through which were good and not-so-good in that order.  The GU helped tremendously though because by that time I had gone through Eden Park, Mt. Adams, and Newport and was winding through Cincinnati preparing to go up the strangely desolate Reading and Gilbert roads.  There was a surprising amount of wind gusting through Cincinnati which was both refreshing and strangely difficult in which to run.  I finished by coming up through Eden Park.  My body was exhausted at that point and I was barely carrying a 10 min/mile pace.  All of this could have been caused by starting too fast.  I probably started at a sub-9 min/mile pace which is not effective for a longer run.  I was not able to pick it up from there and really only got slower throughout the run.  For the most part, my legs felt great despite the rest of my body feeling like crap.  The only thing I noticed was that same strange and very mild knee pain.  It was nothing that I am worried about because it subsided in the last couple miles of running and has not yet returned.

      I guess after reading Lisa's update, I will win her courageous psycho award since I decided to run tonight.  Even after watching the rain fall all day and watching the rain turn into a wintry rain-snow putrid mix, I still had a deep desire to run tonight.  I pushed yesterday's run back to today and did strongly debate not running, but for some reason, the snow falling with the rain was really intriguing to me.  After returning home a little later from work, I outfitted myself with my winter running gear (I thought winter ended a couple weeks ago?) and took off just before 9p.m.  There was nothing inviting about tonight.  The icy wind bit through my clothes, the rain continued to fall, and I was hungry & tired.  Either way I set out.  I did a loop up around Xavier for a 40 minute run.  I held a surprisingly fast pace and really felt great.  The cold soon went away as my body heated up and the rain was a somewhat welcome swamp cooler.  As I dodged puddles and squinted through my rain covered glasses, my body wore out much quicker due to being tired and hungry.  All was well though.  I was able to complete all 40 planned minutes and come back and eat.  Most every part of my body is glad for this cooldown period prior to the marathon.

      I'll split the next two updates over two posts because I'm so dang excited about the first one. Update for 4/10/04 All fears of not being able to finish the marathon went away today as we completed our longest run to date and reached the peak of our buildup period for the marathon.  18 miles is what I completed along with Consuelo and Lisa showed us both up by doing 20 miles at a pace you could consider suicidal.  We ran from Brad and Heather's house down through Mayberry (Loveland) to the bike trail, ran north for 7.5 miles (8.5 in Lisa's case) and back south and home for a grand total of 18 glorious miles.  We kept a good pace (~10 min/mile) for the first half, then Lisa broke off from us, Consuelo and I both walked for 5 minutes and tried some GU and took off again.  Consuelo and I stayed together for a couple miles, but when he started feeling a little worse, the yellow majesty of my shoes kicked in and I felt better than I have in a long time on a run.  I took off around mile 11 or 12 and carried a wonderful pace of around 9 min/mile.  I was able to go all the way until mile 16.5 where we were all going to meet and finish the run together.  What happened next was the coolest set of events on one of my runs so far.  In an attempt to fill up my water bottle, I had the owner of an ice cream shop hook me up with possibly the best tasting ice cream I ever encountered.  He extended credit so that I could sit and enjoy a scoop of ice cream while I waited for Consuelo (who unfortunately hurt his knee) to hobble along and Lisa to come sprinting up at an unbelievable pace.  I can still almost taste every bite of that ice cream.  Lisa went ahead of me while I waited for Consuelo to ensure he was okay and finish my ice cream (did I mention how good it was?).  After I gave Consuelo some directions for H&B's house, I took off feeling completely refreshed after a 25 minute break, water, and orange sherbert.  I finished the final 1.5 miles at a sub-9 minute pace.  I would never have expected to feel good after an 18 mile run, but I did.  It was great to come back to visit with everyone and we were all treated to a steak dinner after our run.  This was after I went back to pick up Consuelo, stretched, and went to the store to buy refrigerated pie crust.  All-in-all, it was awesome.  I am now confident I will finish this marathon.

      Updates for 4/7, 4/9, and fun new running stuff!  4/7/04 Lisa and I took off into the night where it threatened rain but turned into one of the coolest runs.  We ran from my house through Eden Park, Mt. Adams, Sawyer Point, and even into Newport for the worst smelling bathroom break ever thanks to a backed up sewage pipe or something dead in that bathroom.  We went for a total of 97 minutes but with all the random breaks, we probably ran about 90 of those and covered close to 10 miles.  We ran much of the early areas of the marathon so it was good to get some perspective how much the course will climb in the first ten miles.  We conquered, yes conquered, one of the worst hills in Mt. Adams (Monastery) top to bottom and bottom to top.  The whole run felt amazing except for the fact that my body was tired come that last mile which led to my decision to buy more running stuff (explained below).  Cool Running Stuff & Update for 4/9/04 After my run on 4/7, I realized my legs were getting too tired so I figured it was the weight of the shoes after having experienced my other lighter shoes that Brad gave me.  I conceded that I should probably try some new shoes for the longer runs, especially the marathon so my legs and body don't wear out so quickly.  It works out well that I got an enormous tax return this year so I was financially able to buy some more shoes.  With that said, I was off to the Running Spot (RS) to buy the lightest, brightest, most well-fitting shoe I have worn yet.  Since they encourage you to try out the shoes at the RS, I was out on Madison trotting up and down in these shoes and I knew within 50 feet that they were my new shoes.  All I can say is that they are bright yellow and weigh nothing, but with the proper arch supports, they feel like clouds on my feet as I whisk along.  Also with the shoes, I got a new carrying case for water and gu for long runs, some gu, and some 3/4 arch supports so I can still feel the magnificence of the air in my shoes.  In order to try out the new shoes on a run, I met Brad and Bobby at the RS.  We did a quick 4 miler from the RS around one of my favorite runs up Madison, Grandin, through some amazing neighborhood off Grandin, Erie, Observatory, and back on Madison.  Even though I had taken that route a couple times before, they introduced me to that neighborhood where I realized what a wonderful place it would be to retire.  The run felt great, even with little stretching, mostly due to the slower pace and probably some to do with the shoes.  As yellow as the shoes are, they carried me up and down hills with greater ease and my body still feels great and ready for the long run this weekend.

      Wow, it's been a while since I last updated I just realized.  I will summarize the last 4 runs I have completed since my last post.    Update for 3/30/04 Cross trained at Heather & Brad's house after Brad wimped out about running in some sissy storm.  What's a little lightning?!  I got to remember how difficult an elliptical really can be for 30 minutes and finished on the rowing machine while Brad sweated away on the stair climber.  It was probably better that I didn't run in that storm, despite my desperate desire to do so.  Update for 4/1/04 Yay for a day to celebrate fools!  Lisa decided to play her own April Fool's day joke on me tonight as she told me she would be at the Rec Center.  I figured it would be a great run to go over to UC, say hi, run around a bit by UC, and run home.  What actually happened was that I ran hard over to UC only to find one of the Rec Center entrances was closed which caused a mile detour while I wove my way around the UC campus.  Even when I finally got into the Sho, that's when Lisa's joke hit me that she wasn't even there.  I decided to run over to the Brick House via the scenic route to beat Lisa up for her unintended joke only to run across Sadie who needed someone to walk her through a "questionable" area around UC.  I gave her safe passage through to the house she was traveling to and ran home from there.  All totaled, I probably completed 70 minutes, but they were hard minutes.  I was running consistently at approximately a 8 1/2 minute pace and in the last 2 miles, I dropped to sub-8.  My hamstrings and calves payed for it later though.  Update for 4/4/04 This was supposed to be one of my longest runs of the buildup period, but due to the time change, physical exhaustion, hunger, and thirst, my body only carried me about 85 minutes of a planned 140.  My hamstrings and calves were burning all of Saturday as I lugged around a 50lb gear bag for the students who we took to RRG.  My calves went back to normal after about 4 miles but my hamstrings are a little tight to this day.  It was still pretty cool to run through the Gorge at that time of the morning when no one else was up, except for some of our campers which is an amazing story that I can only share with runners.  The forest was very peaceful and the course (or gravel road) provided a ton of twists and turns and little hills everywhere.  It was cool except for that time change/5 hours of sleep thing.  Update for 4/6/04 I was able to get back to some semblance of a normal schedule today as I got up early to complete a 45 minute run this morning.  I was very encouraged to find that I really have gotten faster as I had to alter my route a couple times just to get the time in for the run.  My original plan was to run to Xavier via Victory Pkwy and back on Montgomery.  When I reached Xavier in just under 15 minutes, I knew I would have to extend my run from there.  I came back on Montgomery but veered down a sidestreet before I got to Madison and extended my run by about 1.5-2 miles.  Even though I knew I was running a little faster than normal, it was nothing my body couldn't handle and I felt great afterward.  I probably completed over 5 miles in that time.  I might actually clock it in my car tonight just so I have some idea of how far I am running.

      I ventured off for a planned 60 minute run but 45 minute actual run.  I ran a little later (~10p.m.) down Madison to Grandin and through one the best retirement neighborhoods in Cincinnati.  The neighborhood (behind the Country Day school) was really neat and really scary all at the same time.  The houses were gorgeous and the overlooks were spectacular but there were no streetlights so it was treacherously dark.  I made it through unscathed and ran back to the 'hood and back home.  Everything was good, but my knee pain was still quite apparent.  How odd.  Keep the ibuprofen coming!

      I went on a semi-spontaneous but much needed run tonight with Lisa.  We probably ran about 4-5 miles down Clifton from the Brick House, down through the gaslight district and right by Mt. Storm.  It was muggy, a little warm, and my dang knees still have not recovered fully.  My body warmed up and stretched out over the first mile and we were done with two before I even knew what happened.  I didn't notice my knees really at all until we had turned around on our out-and-back.  As we climbed the Clifton hill, I could really begin to feel an ache in both knees both on and around my kneecaps.  I hope this is still just remnants of the marathon and not the sign of an injury onset that will put me down for any more time.

      I got back to running today for the first time since the marathon.  I'm not sure why I decided to run in the heat of the day, but it was good to get out.  I went out for two main reasons.  1. I was itching to get back out and run.  2. This would be one of the last gorgeous days before the cicadas invade that I could run.    The run was short but good.  I am actually still a little sore in my knees from the marathon but nothing intolerable.  I ventured down Madison to the Running Spot and back.  I thought it was funny to still see remnants of the marathon in the form of discarded GU packs and orange peels.  I didn't really feel like stretching too much so I stretched briefly before and really none afterward.  I was mainly just happy to be back out running.  Warm weather is nice in which to run to say the least.  A little hot, but great.    I applied for the NYC marathon on Friday and I will find out if I made it in by mid-June.  If I make it in, I will start hardcore training in July.  Stay tuned for more!

      To all my family, training partners, and friends: The marathon went great yesterday.  The weather was horrible for spectators and walkers, but spectacular for runners.  I finished along with all of my training partners (at least those who registered). I will be updating anyone who I haven't talked to yet, but mostly my update is to say one thing today: THANK YOU  THANK YOU  THANK YOU!  To my training partners: All of you helped me through the training period as I went from no running to a marathon in 5 short months.  All of you offered such a wonderful motivation for long runs and helped me to keep going throughout the numerous injuries and hard training.  The marathon was a cinch with friends like you with whom I could laugh and talk and annoy other runners all the way through the marathon.  :)  All of you also helped to awaken the running spirit in me as I realized that running is something I greatly enjoy and, in part, something I was made to do.  Thank you!  To my family: You offered a such an encouragement throughout these past months and it was such an overwhelming joy to see you along the course and after the race.  Even for those of you who couldn't come or who I didn't see, your encouragement still helped me through some of the toughest miles running thus far.  Thank you for the words of the encouragement, for the signs, for standing out in horrible weather just to watch me run by, for dinners, for driving down from Chicago, and for continuing to support me throughout the whole training process and marathon.  Thank you!  To my friends: Thank you for your words of wisdom and encouragement.  Thank you also for those who also came down to stand in horrible weather or even had a desire to come down and stand in horrible weather to watch me run by and/or congratulate me at the finish.  All of you have been very helpful to me as I prepared for this marathon.  Thank you!  To everyone who has stuck with me through my many numerous updates, thank you, even if you didn't read them at all.  The updates provided an accountability to me to continue pressing on through injuries, amazingly bad weather, laziness, etc.  For those who are interested in seeing my progress since January, all my updates (minus the thought for the day) are posted on my weblog at http://spiderwoebrun.blogspot.com  It was all worth it in the end as I pushed through more miles than I have ever run to truly understand what a marathon experience is.  Thank you all for being a part of that experience in one form or another.  For a brief update of the actual marathon for those who are curious, I will gladly share now. The weather of the day started and stayed horrible in the standard sense, but it was perfect temperature for running and the rain didn't matter at all.  We got to the start line about 10 minutes ahead of time but only to find that we started basically at the back of the pack.  This didn't matter as we made up ground throughout the marathon.  I ran with Consuelo while Lisa and Natalie (the bandit!) broke off from us for a little while.  The first 6 miles went by with ease and we began our ascent into Eden Park and Walnut Hills.  The hills weren't nearly as bad as I remember on previous runs and we talked all the way up the hills, said hi to the family, and kept right on going.  Consuelo and I caught up with Lisa and The Bandit just before mile 9 and we all mostly stuck together through mile 15.  From mile 9, the miles went by faster than I can ever remember and it wasn't until mile 18 that I really even started noticing them.  The course was gorgeous, and in spite of the weather, I cannot believe the amount of spectators that were out to cheer.  Around mile 18, our talking and jokes and laughing slowed a little as we entered into the hardest section of the marathon.  We all stayed together (or at least within 50 yards of one another) through mile 21 when Natalie broke off from us and we found some other friends running.  The family magically appeared just after mile 21 which was awesome and helped me through the next mile or so.  By the time I reached mile 23, I was reaching that running "wall" some may have heard of and I had to stop to walk through the water stop.  I picked right back up after a minute but had to stop again at mile 24 for water and to walk again.  I could easily consider miles 23 & 24 the hardest of my life thus far as the spectators were strangely absent, the miles felt like 15, and each incline felt like Everest.  By the time I reached mile 25, I had recovered enough to know I could run into the finish and the family magically appeared just after that again which gave me the adrenaline I needed to power through the last mile.  Coming into the final mile is impossible to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced it.  After such a long run, to see the family and crowds all cheering for the runners, it was one of the most emotional points of the whole race.  If I would not have been so excited about finishing, I would have wept for all those who came out just to cheer.  Coming into the finish was absolutely glorious because I was still running, could have kept running, and wanted to weep for joy.  Thank you all again for everything.  For those family and friends who are runners, I look forward to running with you in about 6 months after I recover.  For everyone else, I will talk to you soon.  Thank you  Thank you  Thank you!  Tyler

      Due to a late night last night, there was no possibility of me getting up early this morning to run, so I planned ahead and ran after work.  I had a few stops before I got home and this was much to my advantage.  It was hot today and taking my time getting home helped tremendously to allow the temperature to cool some before I ran.  I took off about 6:15p.m. and went straight up Victory Parkway.  I made it just north of Xavier before I had to turn around.  I only went 4 miles and felt great for the most part.  I was a little tired and it showed on my way back as some of the hills of Victory truly were a victory to overcome (in the Rocky sense).  The bruthas in the 'hood were a little confused by a white man dancing around on the street like an idiot though so I got back to running.  :)  I continued to learn tonight that it is more than helpful for me to start with a shorter stride than my normal pace stride.  This allows me to start slower and warmup my muscles more before I break into full stride near the end.  I was able to start slow tonight and finish fast which is my goal of any run I do so that was pretty cool.  I was also able to run past Cincy cops without getting shot at as well, yet another benefit!  For a final thought tonight, I unfortunately had a song going through my head that I am neither proud of nor able to share with you now due to the lyrical content.  Cursed 107.1 and their vulgar lyrics!  Either way, have a great week!  Training for NYC starts next week!

      On this spectacular morning, I woke up ready to run, got dressed, stretched a little, and took off.  I only intended to do 3 miles today so I was looking forward to an easy day back.  I was about one mile in when I realized I had forgotten to check one thing before going out.  Only a runner will understand why I had to stop my run and go directly home, much to my dismay.  Either way, I felt good except for that one thing and I am excited for another training season leading up to a marathon.  No final thought for today since the run was so short.  Have a great week!

      Some days you got it and some days you don't.  Today was right in between for me.  I journeyed out into, again, some of the best weather EVER in which to run.  I went up Victory Parkway just past Walnut Hills High School, right by Xavier, then west into North Avondale (or whatever that area is).  I was tired and it took a few minutes to really get going.  My body felt fine even though I probably started out too fast leaving me breathless and slow by the end.  I cease to stop learning things on my runs.  Today's lesson was the noxious odor of garbage day mixed with car exhaust fumes makes for difficult breathing while running.  This is especially noticeable when you are running uphill and downwind of garbage, yecch!  It was again good to get up early and get my run done despite being more tired than yesterday.  My knee pain has mostly subsided to a dull ache and with the rest from running I will take over the next 5 days combined with a steady diet of ibuprofen should fix most aches in and around my kneecaps.  We shall see.  I'm off this weekend from any long runs due to a RRG trip.  I know my legs will get enough of a workout thanks to that.  I'll be back next week.  Today's thought for the day hit me at the end of the run for whatever reason but seemed quite appropriate considering this time of the year. And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.  And I won't forget the ones who died and gave that right to me.  Have a great weekend!

      Wheee!  I was able to get up early to run, much to the dismay of my body.  Due to a birthday celebration on Monday night and a horrendous run Sunday, I cancelled my run Tuesday and decided to get back to morning running today.  It was great and much different than winter mornings.  My body was still just as tired and confused as far as why I was up so early and why the heck was I running but it woke up soon enough.  The temperature could not have been more perfect (perfecter?) considering I didn't even sweat until 10 minutes into the run.  As usual, the first 10 minutes was the hardest part of the run but it soon got better.  I could have used more sleep but my body felt good and my knees didn't hurt nearly as much as they usually have been.  Perhaps my ibuprofen diet mixed with consistent running is helping?  Who knows.  I covered another favorite shorter run through Twin Lakes park, Eden Park, and Mt. Adams.  It is very hilly, but very rewarding for the views and environment in which you run.  I either woke up all the other runners or it was just good timing in that, runners and walkers became more frequent throughout my run.  Go runners!  Enough for today, back tomorrow with another 4 miler or so.  For a final thought today, this is quite appropriate considering how I felt on some of the run today. Calm down, release your cares  The stale taste of recycled air  Have a great day!

      Happy Father's Day all you fathers!  I set out tonight with Brad after all the fun of Father's Day activities on one of the hardest 3-4 miles I have completed since I started running.  We are both intent on training together as much as possible since we plan on sticking together in the NYC.  We couldn't have picked worse conditions in which to run.  This time of the year the bad conditions will rarely be related to the weather.  Today, for me, it was a combination of very little sleep, a long run the day before, and a big dinner that we ate just an hour before our run.  Nothing beats that combination to leave you tired, panting, and with a throw-up feeling in your stomach and throat (Mmmm!).  We hammered through the miles talking all the way regardless of what pain we felt or how much we felt like throwing up after that meal.  Don't get me wrong, the meal was delicious as it usually is when we eat at Heather and Brad's.  It's just really hard to follow that with a run.  I let Brad go on at the end and add a couple extra minutes.  I had nothing to prove since I had just done a pretty lengthy run yesterday.  It probably goes without saying that I was feeling pain throughout my body.  I noticed most in my knees (as usual anymore) and my quads and calves (oddly).  All was well though because we made it.  For a final thought today, I will return to one from before regarding how I felt during the run. Suddenly, agony, filling me, killing me!  Suddenly, out of breath, what is this?  Is this death?  Have a great week!  It should be gorgeous.

      I set out today on a downright perfect day with respect to temperature, conditions, wind, and shoes.  It was a sunny 73 degree day with a slight breeze that was just strong enough to keep me cool but not slow me down.  I wore the shoes of yellow majesty and they wisked me along effortlessly.  I went way further than expected as I tried my best to run to the Coffee Emporium to visit Sarah.  Unbeknownst to me, the CE is easily more than 5 miles from my house making for a run that is significantly longer than I had anticipated or desired today.  I stopped short of the CE and probably still covered just over 7 miles in about 65 minutes.  I felt surprisingly good and the only thing that I noticed was a little tiredness mixed with a slight knee pain near the end of the run on Madison.  It was okay though, I had the wonderful sounds of !!! (chk chk chk) to carry me up the hill on Madison and all the way home.    A lot of what kept me running today was the excitement of running the NYC marathon in November.  In case you haven't guessed, I am dang excited to run the marathon that inspired me to start running in my favorite city on the planet.  Go NYC!  The final thought of the day comes from the energizing sounds of !!!. "Now get on down...  And shake that butt!"  Have a great weekend and enjoy this weather!

      I went on a quick 45 minute run tonight through the 'hood over to Clifton to visit friends and then back through the 'hood under the puzzled eye of residents.  I went later to the crime stoppers website only to see that someone had been shot on a corner that I had just run by, how comforting.  It was a great run though.  I got strangely tired on the way to Clifton and had to stop and walk for a minute.  I was able to pick right back up though and hammer through until I met friends briefly.  It was a good break and I was able to take off at a faster pace (sub 9 minute) all the way back home.  Some things I learned on this run.  Taft is significantly darker and eerier than MLK at night.  The residents of the 'hood will always be confused about a white man like me running through the neighborhood.  Finally, I learned that a coffee shop is an ironic place to stop mid-run for a break.    No final thought for the night tonight.  Sorry  Until the next run, whenever it might be.

      I completed the Memorial Day Race down at Lunken Airfield yesterday.  It was a ton of fun, the course was fast, the weather was great, and people ate cicadas (intentionally).  The RCGC (Running Club of Greater Cincinnati) hosted the event and fun was had by all.  I ran surprisingly and almost unbelievably fast based on my time.  For the 5 mile course, my time said 36:50 which puts me at 7:12 minute miles on average.  I may have been going fast, but it certainly didn't feel like that fast.  Who knows?  I felt great and instituted a new stretching technique where I only stretch after my run.  I let my body warmup and stretch out on the run with some incredibly minor stretches before then do a full stretch routine afterward.  What resulted was feeling good on the run and tremendous afterward.  My knee pain is all but gone and I am excited to get back on a regular running schedule.  Bring on NYC if I get in or Columbus if I don't!    One thing to note, some runners (okay, a lot of runners) are on crack.  We finished between 9:30a.m. and 10:30a.m. yesterday to return to a cookout which included hamburgers, chips, pretzels, and other good after run snacks including chocalate covered cicadas and jalapeno cicada poppers.  On top of all that, there was a stinking KEG of beer!  There are times when I am not even up that early in the morning, let alone have a desire to drink.  But hey, according to one of the runners, "You have to get your carbs somehow!"  Right, give me some pasta and wheat bread anytime.  The burger was weird enough to eat at that time.

      Well after a such descriptive title, I'm not sure what else to explain.  I tried to run in the same place as Tuesday night (Beckett Ridge) last night but it was after dinner leaving me feeling sluggish and with a pukey feeling as my food tried to digest.  I set out again into the gorgeous weather of the evening right as the sun was setting.  My body never had a chance to catch up after dinner though as I tried my best to carry a decent pace and finish my intended 4 miles.  I slogged through 2 miles, debated stopping there since I was running by the house but kept on going only to stop a mile later in disgust of how bad I felt.  I walked back the mile and didn't even bother stretching.  The pukey feeling didn't really leave me until the Mayberry sister hooked me up with some gingerale after I took her back to Mayberry (Loveland).  The only redeeming qualities of the run had nothing to do with the run at all.  For starters, the Big City sister is in town and she has brought my two favorite nieces (Squidlet and Feral).  Secondly, the sky was gorgeous which leads to my final thought for the day.  Nothing else good to report.  At least it's good to be back to some semblance of running.  Now for a positive final thought after such a bad run. So amazing, as You paint the sky. So amazing, makes me wonder why You love me like You do.  Have a good day! TW

      Hey everyone! Perhaps I should have heeded the warning signs from my last run a week ago and realized that I would be taking an unexpected break from running.  Due to life and a RRG trip, I have been off running for a week but I finally got back in the saddle again last night for a glorious 4 miles through some of my old paths of younger years.  I visited "The Mother" in Beckett and ran the trail there.  It took me back to many years spent biking and rollerblading up and down those paths and at times in my run I'm sure I wished that I was on a bike or had rollerblades on.  Truly it was a great run.  I was able to start slow with iPod in hand and tunes jamming in my ear.  I let my body warm back up to running and did my best to not look goofy for the first mile.  By miles 2 and 3 I had broken into regular stride of a sub-9 minute pace and I felt wonderful.  The weather was a perfect fall day (in July?) and there was a chilly wind keeping me from getting too hot.  By mile 4, I decided to kick it up a little and I opened up to a 8 or sub-8 minute pace.  The only drawback to running in a familiar place is the opportunity to see friends from the past.  A half mile from the end when I was in full stride, I saw friend's mother from childhood and stopped to talk.  It was wonderful to see her but I was a little upset about having to stop right in the middle of my final push.  It was okay.  The run was pretty much over so I took a 4-5 minute break to talk to her, then plodded out the final half mile never to recover my pace.  As much as I try to fight it, I can't help but realize it is so much easier for me to run after work in the evening sometime.  My body is usually just too tired in the mornings so there may be a slight shift in training and schedule to accomodate for that.  Okay enough for today barring the final thought.  For a final thought today, some lyrics that mimic what my mind has had to tell my body at times when I think I'm hurt or don't want to keep going. You're alright There's nothing wrong Self sufficience please! And get to work  Have a great week and look for more updates soon! TW

      I was able to get up and run this morning much to the dismay of my body and many external forces.  It seemed that everything was working against me to today as my body felt sluggish, my legs felt like concrete, along with just being tired.  Within the first mile of the run, my body felt like garbage, I swallowed a bug that left me with a hairball hack feeling the rest of the run, and I almost got hit by a car (granted I was jaywalking something fierce but that car was travelling WAY TOO FAST!).  My legs were able to carry my body just over 4 miles in about 40 minutes.  I also seemed to find the dirtiest, smelliest neighborhood in all of Cincinnati.  This didn't help any.  I would compare the cleanliness to that of a street in Hamilton(!) and the smell to that of a garbage dump.  It was whatever neighborhood is directly northeast of Walnut Hills, East Hill or O'Bryonville or something.  I often had to hold my breath through the noxious smells of the street while dodging garbage strewn everywhere.  I was happy to finally come out on Madison Road in O'Bryonville.  I'm not sure why I thought it would be a good idea, but I then decided to go down Torrence and back up Taft.  When I wasn't sucking on car fumes on Torrence, the downhill was okay, but peril loomed as I began up Taft.  The hills up Taft were shear treachery and forced me to stop and walk once and drag myself up the rest of the way after that.  I was happy to get home but even so tired that even stretching in the end was a chore.  Runs like today are not fun but knowing my end goal I can still understand why I do them.  Here's hoping tomorrow is a new, better day!  No final thought for the day, I need to go drink a gallon of Listerine or something to get this insect taste out of my mouth.  Have a better day than I did a run!

      This is sort of a two-for-one update but both of these runs occurred on Sunday.  This was a first for me, two runs in one day but it was spectacular for some reason.  I had planned on running 9 miles for the weekend, 6 on Saturday and 3 on Sunday, but after an atrocious display of golf on Saturday I wasn't feeling up to running.  Instead I decided to run all 9 miles Sunday, but due to time constraints, I had to split it over a 5 mile run and 4 mile run.  I will summarize both below but overall I can say that two runs in a day is surprisingly cool.  After a break on Saturday, I felt fresh on both runs to the point that I felt like I could have run a marathon yesterday, just split over a 14 mile run and a 12 mile run.  I did both runs again with my iPod and even though I have to carry it, since it will pull my pants down on my hip, I enjoy the flexibility of having more than an hour and a half of music.  5-mile Overlook Run This run is increasingly becoming another one of my favorites and I did something I have only dreamed of doing thus far.  From my house, I can run to about 5 various overlooks that give you a wonderful view of the River, Newport and Bellevue, Cincinnati, and things of that nature.  These overlooks proved quite cool in the winter when the sun was setting or rising but they were no less cool Sunday.  I went through Twin Lakes Park first, then up the hill to whatever overlook is above that.  I then got a wild hair up... somewhere and decided that instead of running up into Mt. Adams my usual way, I would run up Hill Street.  Heather will be most familiar with this street considering she probably drove it many times.  I wasn't fortunate enough to have motorized transportation but I conquered that murderous hill with surprisingly little effort.  I would compare it in difficulty to Monastery (also in Mt. Adams) but way different because it's at a steeper angle.  The bittersweet victory of that hill is interesting.  You feel tremendous that you have conquered such a hill but then you have nowhere to go but UP AGAIN!  Needless to say, I took a one minute breather at the top and walked to get my breathing back to normal.  I could have run through it, but there was no need.  After that, I continued on to other overlooks behind Playhouse and next to the Art Museum and then adjourned to my house.  I started pretty slow around a 9+ minute pace but ended well below a 9 minute pace.  The rain that fell before this run helped to cool the temperature down but unfortunately, it also increased the humidity to about 22,000 percent.  Despite that it was a great, great run!  4-mile Criss-Crossin' The 'hood Run This run almost didn't happen because I was still concerned about running twice in one day and I had felt some tightness in my muscles in the previous run.  I set out anyway right as it was getting dark with iPod in hand.  All my worries of two runs in a day or tightness in my muscles or fatigue melted away as I completed the first mile.  I fell right back into pace and ran every road that connects Taft and McMillan from where McMillan meets Taft all the way West to Victory Parkway.  At Victory Parkway, I went North up that and circled back around home down Woodburn.  The temperature was great, I felt great, and the iPod helped me to hammer through the four miles in the 'hood and get back and go to bed.  I felt so good running that I started at a sub-9 minute pace and finished well below an 8-minute pace.  Nothing much else to report beyond that.  Sorry for the long post, but I was really excited about feeling so good on both runs.  I'm back at my midweek, morning (hopefully) runs tomorrow with 4 miles.  Look for more updates then.  For a final thought, a quote that summarizes my feeling when I made it into NYC. It's official, raise your glasses, 'cause this party gonna go to Damascus.  Have a great week!

      I took off again Thursday night after work on a glorious 4-5 mile run through the 'hood of my neighborhood and Avondale.  The temperature was awesome, I felt really good again (except for maybe some tightness in my lower legs), and I actually got to take my iPod again and let the sounds of Ibiza power me through my run (did I say I wouldn't take the iPod again?).      I went up Victory Parkway from my house and turned left up into Avondale just before I got to Dana.  From there, it was an up and down run as I ran in between Reading Road and back to Victory Parkway along all the roads before you get to MLK.  The hills were awesome to run up and down and I love running through Avondale when there are that many people on the streets.  It leads to more confusion than anything else for other people with questions like, "What's that white boy doing here?" and "Why you running so fast white boy?"  My journey led me down streets I have never seen in all of my years living in the city and down streets that I probably wouldn't frequent.  It actually got to a point in my run where I looked up and wondered, "Where am I?"  No big deal, Avondale isn't THAT big and I knew it was small enough to get out of to go home.      One funny thing to note is more of a runner's experience that most only runners will appreciate but I will share anyway.  About my third street between Victory and Reading, I started to really have to use the restroom (1 not 2) and it just so happened that the road I was on was all woodsy and vegetationy (that's a word) with no houses at that particular point.  Well, since I am a man and the world is my urinal, I sped over to a U-shaped area of vegetation but was faced with a dilemma.  There was only coverage for one way of traffic.  If I chose incorrecty and a car drove by going that direction, they would absolutely see a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the 'hood.  I had been running up this road for a few minutes and had not seen one car.  In fact prior to that, it was downright peaceful with the wooded area and no traffic and all.  Considering that, I figured I couldn't lose, no cars would come anyway no matter which side I picked.  Good thought, right?  WRONG!  Well I chose my side and had no sooner begun my dastardly deed then of course, you guessed it, a car came driving by to see a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the 'hood.  It was okay though, it's probably not the first time they have seen something similar.  At least I wasn't in some guy's front yard, right?    Enough for today.  I don't even have a final thought.  I will just leave you with that picture of a tall, lanky white boy peeing in the hood.      Have a great weekend!  Six miles coming up for me this weekend, followed by a 3 miler on Sunday.

      Wednesday's run was fast, fun, and still educating as usual.  I  journeyed to Sharon Woods tonight for two laps around and around the  lake.  This was apparently what many other people decided to do as well  as I saw a multitude of people walking, jogging, running, biking, etc.  I felt great and was able to maintain a fast pace after I started slow  for the first half mile or so.  I went 4.5 miles in 40 minutes.  I  haven't done the math enough to figure out minutes per mile but that's  6.75 miles per hour.  I took my iPod for the first and last time until  I either buy a mini or an armband for the existing.  I ended up having  to carry the iPod the entire way.  It was fine at first but it  progressively got heavier and eventually felt like a bowling ball by  the end.  I tossed it down the path in the end and knocked over some  senior citizens then used a rock to pick up the spare.  The weather was  phenomenal, I felt great, but the coolest thing about the run was the  people.  I had two favorites who stuck out in my mind and I'm not sure  who should win the the physical fitness award.  It comes down to the  woman walking and talking ON A CELL PHONE or the man who may have been out for a walk with his dog but he had stopped to sit on the curb and  smoke (Debbie).  Since I only saw the woman actually doing any  exercise, I guess the award will have to go to her.  I don't know if I  can actually classify what the smoker was doing as true exercise.  Maybe walking to the curb from his car (5 feet away) felt like murder  to him, but the Marlboro most likely disqualifies him.  Other than  that, I journey back out tonight to enjoy the weather and get those  miles in for training.  It could stay this temperature all year as far  as I'm concerned but then they would call this place San Diego.    For a final thought tonight, I listened to music with no words so it  will have to come from the sticker I saw on a car when I finished that must have known something deeper. Half way through my stretches, I happened to look at this car and the sticker read: You smell like butt  Have a great day!

      After an excruciatingly hot birthday run on Saturday, I set out with Brad on a post birthday dinner run on Sunday night.  The temperature was much better even though the humidity was not.  Everything in my body was telling me to not go running, but to drive home and sleep.  The run was setting up to be another unenjoyable after-meal run where I was tired and cramping up.  I sucked it up anyway and took off with Brad.  A storm just happened to rolling in at that time so for most of the run, we had a spectacular light show from the approaching lightning.  Since the storm was coming, it helped to bring the temperature down which made running quite enjoyable.  I didn't experience any pain or discomfort like I thought I would and actually felt downright good on the run.  All the joints and muscles and ligaments and sinews felt pretty good.  The slight discomfort in my knees was still present in some of the later inclines but the pain, in general, seems to be receding.  Truly the best part of the run, though, was easily the last 5 minutes.  Sprinkles of rain began to fall about a mile out which didn't bother me one bit since it was still pretty hot.  The rain increased and we increased our pace along with it.  By the time we reached H&B's house, it was downright pouring and we were flying.  I didn't care about getting soaked for a brief minute.  It was absolutely spectacular to run through the torrential rain and lightning and thunder.  It was almost surreal for about 12 seconds before we reached the door.  I can't wait for more summer storms in which to run.  For those in Cincinnati, if you see the sky clouding up or a storm rolling in, don't be surprised to think that I may be lacing up my running shoes to go and enjoy a run in it.    I get back to my mid-week runs tonight with 3 4-mile runs in a row.  I have decided that the NYC plan I was going to follow has just too many miles for the long runs.  I am not running to break any records or beat any personal bests (it's a little hard to have personal bests when you haven't even been running a year).  The NYC is the marathon that inspired me to start running and I am going to enjoy it with Brad no matter if we run a 7 hour marathon.  With all of that said, I am scaling back my long runs by two miles which doesn't mean much to any of you, but it means a tremendous amount to me with regard to wear and tear and time on the road.    Okay, how about a final thought for today? Beautiful You are to me, beautiful the raging sea.  Have a great week!

      Why did I take off on an 80+ degree day that happened to be my birthday to run 8 miles in heat indexes that easily reached into the 90's?  Simple, the NYC marathon is 17 weeks away and I need to be ready.  Any other questions?  I didn't think so.  I did take off into the heat of the day but I had a ton of water and my course provided water at perfect points during my run.  I ran to the Coffee Emporium in Hyde Park (mmm, who else wants coffee right in the middle of a run?!) and there was a water fountain right in between my house and the CE.  This meant I could run to the CE stopping for water along the way, get water at the CE, and then get water on the way back.  This may sound like an extremely in-depth look at hydration but since it's hot, I have to pay attention to it.  The run went great for the most part.  Even though it was hot out, I forced myself to slow down since it was the long run for the week and also since it was so hot.  I probably averaged just under 10 minute miles based on my time there and back.  I only took three water breaks and I think I only had to stop to walk once when I took off too fast from a water break.  I wasn't upset at all at how I felt or how the run went.  It would have been nice to run earlier in the day before the sweltering heat set in, but this worked out fine.  I did notice myself getting pretty tired before I reached the CE and then really tired on my way back.  Dreaming of what I would eat and in what order after I ran kept me running.  Sad I know, but I was hungry.  There was a storm moving in near the very end of the run.  I can't tell you how good the rain would have felt after such a scorching run.  Raindrops teased me up Madison Road and I could see the thunderheads rolling in quickly.  I was not fortunate enough to be drenched by the rain to cool me down though.  Maybe some other day.  That's about all for this run.  One note, though, is a comment from Runner's World about hydration (since the summer months are upon us).  I'll leave you with that for a final thought since it made me laugh. "Even if you think you're drinking a lot, you're probably not drinking enough.  I know I am when I have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee." (I thought that's what getting older was like too?)  Have a great weekend!  Happy birthday to me!

      In the past two days, I have been able to complete 1 1/2 runs.    The first run only counts as half and not really worth mentioning.  I made it just over a mile on a gorgeous Wednesday morning only to be turned around by some "complications" that only runners will understand.  It was frustrating to have to walk back but at least it wasn't boring.  I'm still amazed at the amount of people on the streets at that time.  More importantly, I never cease to be amazed at who is on the streets at that time.  Wednesday I saw a 6 or 7 year old girl just wandering down the street just before 7a.m.  I am sure school is out so it left a variety of questions in my head that I won't take the time to list here.    Thursday's run was an almost identical run to a run I did with Brad a few weeks back.  I was sleep-deprived and had just loaded up on a 4 course meal that included steak and potatoes.  Against much of my better judgment, I set out about an hour after dinner right as darkness was settling in.  I completed 4 miles down Madison and a little ways past the Running Spot.  I could not shake a pukey feeling throughout the run, as you could probably imagine trying to run with that much stuff in your stomach.  I fought cramps through the first 3 miles and by the 4th mile, my body was ready to quit due to exhaustion.  I didn't feel nearly as bad last night as I did with Brad two weeks ago, but after large meal runs are increasingly becoming my least favorite of all runs.  My knees only escalated to an annoying ache when I was powering up hills.  Other than that, besides the exhaustion and pukey feeling, I felt great.  I crashed quickly upon arriving home too which was wonderful.  I am resting today and gearing up for an 8-miler on Saturday.  Look for more updates then!  For a final thought today, something that has been going through my head for the past 3 days. We were meant to live for so much more.  Have we lost ourselves?  Somewhere we live inside.  Have a great weekend!

      Today was the official start of my training for NYC!  It was a great morning to start considering I was able to get up and out the door before the sun and humidity began to melt smaller cars and slow-moving, old people.  I took off initially down through Twin Lakes park and Eden park.  I wound around to Gilbert and up into the 'hood.  Gilbert was no small task considering it was uphill for at least 1/2 mile.  I then turned into the bowels of the 'hood, past Heather's old dive of an apartment and criss-crossed the streets for another 15 minutes.  I fully expected to have most of the streets to myself considering the time but some streets were still riddled with the crack fiends stumbling home with their 40's and the "bruthas".  With that said, anyone who needs their fix at 6:45 in the morning is welcome to come running with me.  :)  I probably went just over 3 miles.  The first 10 minutes, as with any morning run, were the hardest since my legs still felt like concrete and my mind still had not figured out what the heck I was doing up that early and especially why I was running.  Beyond that, the miles seemed to melt away like some poor old man who couldn't get out of the sun fast enough.    As for a final thought today, something that will probably carry me the course of this training. "Show me Your grace and let it flow down from the cross where You showed me You loved me."  Have a great week!

      What a hot one today folks!  Not only hot but sticky muggy too!  Temperatures were in the 80's with the heat index probably in the 90's.  What a wonderful day to sit by the pool or sit anywhere and not run.  Since I had to run, I decided to try my hand at some trail running.  I got to experience Ault Park for the first time ever and I was very impressed with the amount of trails and sidetrails and get-horribly-lost trails there were in that little expanse of woods.  I set out and found the same railroad tracks about 14 times while I ran in circles and dodged some huge snake that scared the bejesus out of me and up and down hills in the process.  I would have to rate Ault Park trails a step behind Red River Gorge trails in difficulty, but not that far behind at all!  The hills and extreme terrain of some of the sidetrails of Ault Park were just as difficult as RRG.  I made it to the top of Ault Park with the cool overlook thing and pretty gardens and had a nice, little, romantic moment with the flowers or something but kept right on running and sweating.  I had to stop to walk a significant amount due to the heat, hills, and for water at the top and I probably ran under 6 miles but I certainly accomplished a lot to run as far as I did today.  For a final thought today, a song that made me laugh on the way home due to its wonderful application to my run today. Round, round, round we go.  Training starts next week, Tuesday to be exact.  Wheee!  18 weeks until the NYC marathon!  Have a great 4th of July weekend!

      Two updates for the cost of one today since I have gotten behind with posting (but not running) recently.  A few notes before I launch into my updates, quirks, and bold-face lies: 1.  A story posted a week or so ago in which I used the restroom in a wooded area may have been misrepresented.  I was NOT in someone's front yard as some may think or wonder.  I was in some protected wooded area which may not make my crimes any better. 2.  After my most recent update of a "pukey feeling" run, Heather (the "Mayberry" sister) got the impression that I was blaming her cooking for me feeling pukey.  This was not the case at all.  I felt pukey because I ate a wonderfully cooked dinner prepared by Mayberry then tried to run (never a good combination).  Enough of the notes, on with the obsessively long updates.  Update for 7/29/04  "That Guy" run I have realized that in running, I have become "That Guy."  I am that guy running in zero degree weather that everybody honks at to get back inside.  I am that guy who is running in 90+ degree heat indexes with tunes jamming away while sweat pours down every inch of me.  I am that guy who is running down your street between the hours of 5:30 and 6:30a.m.  I am also the guy who is running down your street at 11:00p.m. (as was the case this night).  I got home a little later than expected but had to run so I set out at 10:45p.m. for a quick 4-miler.  Even though I had already eaten dinner, unlike Wednesday, I left enough time for it to digest.  This made a huge difference as I felt great this night and could have run much longer except for getting tired near the end.  I continue to learn on my runs and Thursday I learned that a cemetary is the spookiest thing by which to run at 11 at night.  It was downright desolate while I was running and the spooky, dark bushes outside the cemetary on Victory Parkway didn't help matters any.  I expected the cast of the Thriller video to come crawling out and perform a synchronized dance routine but no luck.  I sped past the cemetary, up to Xavier, east on Dana, and then down Woodburn to home.  I got incredibly tired coming down Woodburn due to the time of night and the fact I should have been in bed.  I was still able to make it home in reasonable time and covered just over 4 miles.    Update for 7/31/04  Sweltering 6 I'm not sure why I decided to set out in the hottest part of Saturday but I did because I had to get my miles in for the week.  I did get a chance to try out my new iPod armband with much success meaning I won't have to carry the stupid thing anymore.  The heat is the main thing to report about Saturday.  It was downright sweltering and the sweat that came out of unknown pores on my body proved it.  My body was still a little tired and confused about the amount of sleep I got (>11 hours) but I dragged myself along for 6 miles.  I went right down MLK to the fraternity house mainly because I knew that there and back, the frat house is 6 miles away.  This helped me to not focus on time so much as the distance.  This run was riddled with stops for walking.  I stopped at the halfway point to walk for a minute.  After the treachery of the University Hospital hills, I stopped for another 1:30 and then with a mile left to go, I stopped for 2:00.  I'm not sure why I stopped so much but I really wasn't in any mood to push my body super hard on a long run day.  Even though I had my iPod with me, it would have helped to have some water with me as well.  My 8 mile run to the CE was great because there was water along the way and at the halfway point.  This run was just an urban jungle or more like an urban desert.  I drank close to a gallon of water upon returning.  I ran way too fast as well which could have led to excessive tiring.  I completed 6 miles (with walking stops) in 50 minutes.  This may sound good, but not the kind of times I shoot for on my long runs.  Oh well, there is always next week.    I had planned on 3 miles Sunday but just didn't do it.  I maintained most of my miles last week and don't feel bad about missing 3 miles.  I'm still hearing reports that my partner in crime, Bradley Ryan Zappin, has horrendous shin splints and might try to get out of this marathon.  Keep him in your prayers if you remember and pray that he is okay by marathon time (or long before so he can get his miles in) because I will drag him the 26.2 miles if I have to.  Enough for today and this past weekend.  Thanks for tuning in!  Have a great week! TW
