      I have just looked at a few peoples Blogs, they are good, they talk about good things. Someone was talking about Peace, and interfaith work. I know that it all sounds nice, I mean who dont want peace and Love in the World, and who would not do all that they could for peace? But what is peace? Peace between people is good but does that mean that we have peace with God, and even if peace between people can be achieved, what will make it last, we all know that we are incapable of up holding the peace that we seek, we can look back over the thousands of years to see that. Or do we believe that we are evolving into super humans whos brains seek now to be good, and peaceable people? Have we let go and moved on from our waring and murderous ways?  I can see that in my own city that is not so, infact I think that people are getting worse. Our ability to make things and learn only intensifies our ability to distroy and be evil. People think that we are born good, but lets face it we are all bad, and do bad things. Peace comes with a price and none of us have paid that price, none of us can, it is too much for us. there is not a man on earth that can say that he has lived a perfect life, and lived  at peace will everyone.  Peace in not atanable by us. It will not be attained by religions coming together either. It sounds obserd to me that all these Ways to god can come together and live in peace and find God. Peace with man may happen from time to time and by this method or that compromise, but peace with God only comes in one way. There cannot be many ways to God. God is not in the habbit of confusing people and allowing them to think that they are going to heaven and yet not. He makes It plain and easy to see, to those who seek Him. Peace with man only comes as a result of having peace with God! And there is only one exclusive way that that can happen, Through JESUS.   Christianity is the Only way to God because the problem of sin and evil has been delt with at the Cross of Christ. and because of what He did we have access to the Father, Peace with God, and peace wiht mankind. All religion admits that there is good and bad, Sins and Evil deeds etc, and all believe that if you get rid of that then you are on your way to becoming Holy, good or even a god. But knowing the human race we see that that is not possible by ourselves, and God Had to do something about it, else no one would know Him or go to heaven.  Interfaith looks good on the outside but on the inside there is one problem, Jesus is not allowed in, because He is exclusive, He said that He is the Only Way, and the Only Truth, and Christians will not and cannot accept anything but what He has said. "christians that do have fallen away from the Truth and are in danger!  There is only one way to God the Father and that is Through JESUS CHRIST, I hope that anyone that reads this will take courage and ask God for themselves!  God Bless  Mathew  PS Sorry for any Spelling errors!

      I just think that Life could be much easyer if we were not so bad at it. I mean, come on, all the bad stuff that WE do in the World, the hate and stuff. You know what I think it is time for a Change...what do you think?  What would it take to change the World, I mean, who could do it, Change the world. I guess that it would take some thing amazing, but not an external thing, I mean an event or a gig, or a tv show or plague would not work, wed all be the same, oh that is it,it is not the world that needs to change, is it?   No, it is us!  WHo is it that causes all the fights and killing and bad stuff...its us, you and me! What is it that needs to be changed, you and me? How is that gonna happen then? Self help books? More prisons, executions and the like? Will the creation of more rules and tougher police work, work? Druging people to keep them chilled and calm? I dont think that we have the answer...Humanity has a big Problem, its self, and no solutions...No hope! What will we do? we can try, and no doubt we have, religion has not worked...for many many year man has thought that if only he could be good, then life would be better and God would accept him. But alas It has not been so.  More later, Still seeking to see!  Love  Mathew

      It is a day that I would prefer being in bed through. I watched the England Game!! what a match, I thought that we played ok, there were alot of unforced errors from England, and though we won I think that they could have played a whole lot better!  My Girlfriend is away in London for the next few days, that will mean that I can have some time with the Lord, Extra time that is. I need wakin up I am so sleepy, spiritually speaking.   A friend of mine wrote to me and said that all christians are Evengellists, and have been called to tell people of Jesus. I have not had much oppertunity to do  that in a Christian company, but you know what, I know that it is not tellin people about the Lord often that is making me so sleepy and slow in the spirit! I really need some insperation and a kick in the rear!  Even christians get blinded at times, the world and all the riches and pleasures that it waves in your face, blinding you to the Lord, seducing you into the World and darkness of sin, keeping you from the comfort of the Father and the Grace of the Lord Jesus. We need to be careful what we allow into our lives, what we watch read and do. It is easy to slip into sin and worldlyness.   Take reading your star signs for example. What is that all about? How can Christians Believe that stuff and claim to Love the Lord? ...I cant believe it, they believe in that more than the believe in the Lord's Words the Bible!!!  Any way, Tara just rang me about the Key (University of Hertfordshire Church), she is meeitn with the CU team to talk about Doctrine and the Unity issue. She asked me to pray and for some advice.  Oh, I got to go...  God bless,  May you know the Love of the Lord Jesus in your Spirit!  Mathew

      Well that went Quick. The weekend is Over! Work is here again, you know it dont take long to grow old, I cant eblieve how fast life is movin. I spent part of the weekend watchin a Great Gospel Chior for the USA at a Church in Devon! Boy, they were So good! God was all over it, the presence of the Lord was so strong, the Joy, Peace and clean-Purity of it all was so tangible, but you know, seein anint believing, there was nothing to see but everyting so sence. It was not like goin to a Gig or Pop conscert or sumthin, nope, it was holy, it was...nothing that the world could produice. You could not see the Lord (God) but you know, one just knew that he was there and an in many of the people there. WOW!   Some say that they wont believe unless they see, but you know, Jesus Lived and walked the earth in a human body, God became manifest to us, and people saw His power and Holy Life, He did good to all and was perfect in every way. People saw the Living God, and yet they did not believe in Him. many were healed by Him and Touched by His Power, yet they still turned away from Him. The Bible says that the Godhead (Father, Son and HolySpirit) can been seen through what is Created, but that people surpress this truth and deny Him. Seeing Is not believing. One needs more than sight to see and believe the Lord...seeing is not what we think it is, seeing goes beyond the eyes of men, it is something that is given to us, Spiritual sight is not something that one is born with. it is a Gift that is Given, and to whom is the gift avalable? To all who would call on the Name of the Lord? And who are they, those whom the Lord calls, and that is everyone. The Lord calls everyone everywhere to repent and turn to Him. all who do will be given sight, Spiritual sight...  It was interesting at Church on sunday, we were talking about Persecution and suffering for Christ! What it means and why it happens. In short, it happens because it happened to Jesus. No servant is greater than his Master. It happened to Jesus because who He was and what He stood for was not of this world, the message and the mesenger were holy, and had a message that calls men and women to holy living and a Relationship with God. The message was that we are all sinners and we need salvation, and it is only possible through Him, He is God and we cant get to heaven by any other way! And we as the Children of God become offensive to the world as Jesus was because we believe and see Him, and we speak and live this message.  That is why the suffering comes to the Church, the Church that Live and breath the Gospel.  It was also interesting to hear that the western Church is in the minority, we are a privelaged few that are not being killed for our faith, where in other countrys people are being killed for their faith, daily. over 250,000 Christians are killed each year for their faith! But we in the west still have freedom...how long for? Who knows, and what will we do with that freedom?  I wonder if we are still asking the Lord for sight, so that we can see and know what we can do in these days of such change and intolarence towards Jesus and the Christian faith?  I had a great evening lastnight with my Girlfriend and some friends, I cooked a meal Spaghetti Carbonara (Is that the right spelling?) I cooked it from scratch, it tasted good... No one was sick, Praise the Lord. I was worried because you cook the sauce with 4 egges, raw, and they are supposed to cook by the heat of the pasta...it worked!  I am at work now, www.cornerstonevision.com, if you are interested. We are a design and publishing comp.  My Best friend Jon has a Blog too! We chatted about it, I am not sure why I am writing on this thing, perhaps it is just an outlet for my thoughts, even if no one reads it It will be helping me!  God Bless,  Mathew

      I know, it sounds like I am talking about my apperience don't it. Well, sorry, I am talkin about the way I see things, and why I see things the way I do. We all have eves, dont we? But do we see? I hope that I have sight, and I also pray that you do to. I wonder why we dont all see things the same, I wonder why we see in ways so strange. What is it that we are looking to see, what is it that we strain to look, see? I know that I have been seeing only the way I wanted to till now. I know I still only see what I want, but I hope that as I look, what I see will become more clear to me.  Peace, Love and Righteousness!
