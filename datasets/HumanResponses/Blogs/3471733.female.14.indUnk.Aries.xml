      Hey people,Clothes what does that word mean to you? Clothes means fabric that you where and it costs alot but not something I kill myself over. I mean I have alot of clothes but not so much that that is all that I have. What do you think?                                        Kylie*

      Waz up people, I have alot of cool friends and they mean alot to me!!!! All of them have cool personalities and amaizing lifes. There names are Karlie, Emelia, Nichole, Nicole, Drew, Andrew, Lucy, Peter,Matt,Jamie, Chelsea,Kate, And Mikey. Some of them are my best friends and some of them are just friends. But they all mean the same to me. It is a special thing to have a best friend. Expecially one that I have had for such a long time. A friends loyalty and Honestness means the most in a friendship. I am lucky to have my friends and I hope that all of you feel the same way about your friends. They are friends that will be with you forever and they will love you like you love them. Just dont stab them in the back like some friends do to other friends if you don't then you will have the best friendship ever!                                       Kylie*
