      I'm soon off to my second day at school. We met our new teachers yesterday and got our schedule which was all messed up. Apparently I was put in groups that didn't even exist. I'll have a talk with those in charge... see what they think.

      Yesterday I started folding proteins again, using Stanford University's  urlLink Folding@Home . This is a research project which studies  urlLink protein folding , misfolding, aggregation, and  urlLink related deceases . At the moment I'm folding for the  urlLink MacRumors  team.

      I was out practice-driving today, on the large IKEA parking lot (European large, not a huge ass bloody American large). This is the second time I've been practicing. Fun.

      My  urlLink iPod  (4th gen, 40gb) came today, two weeks after I ordered it. Not too bad. I already have an older iPod (2nd gen, 10gb) which I've used like every day for almost two years now. Anyways, the old iPod goes to my younger brother, who isn't as picky as I am when it comes to gadgets.  iPod pictures:   urlLink 1   urlLink 2     I also got a word from AppleCare today. They said my  urlLink PowerBook  has been sent to the Netherlands to get it's pixels anomalies fixed. The bump, however, is not likely to be fixed.    I sent my PowerBook to service the other day due to  urlLink pixel anomalies  in the LCD-display. The bump came after I slipped on ice like three days after I got it, and it will cost a lot to replace the part that's bumped (luckily no hardware was damaged). They said they would try to straighten it out, but it won't be good as new.

      I woke up and went into the bathroom to have a shower, only to find this bigass spider sitting on my  trousers ! I mean, wtf? I've always thought that spiders don't like fabrics (don't ask me why I had that idea). Anyways, hell if I was going to touch it. Not that it's dangerous or anything... It's just shitugly. So I picked up one of my slippers and tried to push it to the ground with a swift stroke, but the spider apparently had other plans as it ran  into  my trousers. Yay-bloody-hooray! So I decided to deal with it after I had a shower. When I got out I brushed my teeth and all that while thinking of a way to get rid of the spider... after a while of intense thinking, I found out that throwing the trousers and jumping up and down at it like a maniac was probably the best idea... I was  not  going to turn them inside out to look after the little devil. The thought of having one of those bastards running up my sleeve isn't exactly my idea of happy-hour... so when I accomplished my barbaric act, I threw the pants in the laundry... now it's mom's problem.  I feel a slight pity for the spiders who wilder off into houses, not able finding their way out again... and here we are killing them any chance we get... oh well. That's survival of the fittest for you!
