      OK today was still pretty confusing. I failed my outline and thesis, so my English grade goes further into F land. I need to pull that up badly. It is gonna tottaly turn my GPA to shit again. I was asleep in religion today, as usual. I am starting to think Ms. Kosiek doesn't care or notice. As far as Spanish goes, I love that class. And Julia and I totally kicked ass in science today. Math sucked cause i know i failed a quiz today. I hung out with Daniella and Slavin 9th. After school chior was cool, but i have been in a pensive mood since the end of 8th. Its these girls. They are so confusing. Oh well i might know what to do when i wake up.

      oh man i am sleepy. i just did my english and then looked up some science articles. I know that i am wierd for looking at science for pleasure especially at 1 am, but hey, isn't it at least good that i am learning? My mind seems to be working on its own typing this, cause ia can barely stay awake. I am still pretty confused about u girls right now. I have no idea what to do. Anyways, no crew foe 2 days. I have chior. OK, sleep beckons,                                               good night, abe

      SONG OF THE DAY  NIRVANA-  PENNYROYAL TEA  I'm on my time with everyone  I have very bad posture   Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea  Distill the life that's inside of me  Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea  I'm anemic royalty   Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld  So I can sigh eternally  I'm so tired I can't sleep  I'm a liar and a thief  Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea  I'm anemic royalty   I'm on warm milk and laxatives  Cherry-flavored antacids  Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea  Distill the life that's inside of me  Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea  I'm anemic royalty

      hello everyone. I didn't do anything today. So really I am bored and i decided to update this shit hole. Here's for King Dustin who started anew today, hopefully he will keep that up. Poland is full of Queens my friend, and they are yours for the taking. By the way, Chelsea has three balls. Cheers for Jack and Mary who seem to be going well, but not as well as Abe and that fine ass chicana Daniella. Also now that the cat's out of the bag, I think next time we all go to the temple we should all hold Eli in our hearts as the Torah is read. Go SOX 9-3 over Yankees last night. I am looking forward to a good 160-2 season for them. Daniella I am sorry for not calling you.

I have been single for a total of 2 months over the last 3 years. That may be good if it were just one girl but it has been five girls. That fuckin sux.

      I want evryone to read into this and think of what it means now in my life:  Some say the end is near. Some say we'll see armageddon soon. I certainly hope we will. I sure could use a vacation from this  Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of Freaks  Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA The only way to fix it is to flush it all away. Any fucking time. Any fucking day. Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay.  Fret for your figure and Fret for your latte and Fret for your hairpiece and Fret for your lawsuit and Fret for your prozac and Fret for your pilot and Fret for your contract and Fret for your car.  It's a Bullshit three ring circus sideshow of Freaks  Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA The only way to fix it is to flush it all away. Any fucking time. Any fucking day. Learn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay.  Some say a comet will fall from the sky. Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves. Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still. Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits.  Some say the end is near. Some say we'll see armageddon soon. I certainly hope we will cuz I sure could use a vacation from this  Silly shit, stupid shit...  One great big festering neon distraction, I've a suggestion to keep you all occupied.  Learn to swim.  Mom's gonna fix it all soon. Mom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be.  Learn to swim.  Fuck L Ron Hubbard and Fuck all his clones. Fuck all those gun-toting Hip gangster wannabes.  Learn to swim.  Fuck retro anything. Fuck your tattoos. Fuck all you junkies and Fuck your short memory.  Learn to swim.  Fuck smiley glad-hands With hidden agendas. Fuck these dysfunctional, Insecure actresses.  Learn to swim.  Cuz I'm praying for rain And I'm praying for tidal waves I wanna see the ground give way. I wanna watch it all go down. Mom please flush it all away. I wanna watch it go right in and down. I wanna watch it go right in. Watch you flush it all away.  Time to bring it down again. Don't just call me pessimist. Try and read between the lines.  I can't imagine why you wouldn't Welcome any change, my friend.  I wanna see it all come down. suck it down. flush it down.

      Sup all. I am back from the regatta in Cincinatti. it was pretty good and i had a good time. I stroked 2 boats in 4 races and we came out 6th and 10th. I also had alot of fun with my fellow crew mates. I got to know people alot better and my friends and i became closer. The only bad things were that crab i caught at the end of the 4 final and Elli Greybar thinking that I am a perverted creep (thank you Sheila). I need to find my Deftones CD.

      Well this point in my life seems familiar. One week after breaking up. I like different people now. Well once again, not saying that persons name, Spanish Mother of God, I am confused. Well I have a plan, my plan is to wait until the weekend and then develop another plan of action. The SAT is over now so I dont have to worry about that anymore. That removes one major hurdle from my path.  Plan of Action #1  1. Concentrate on the regatta in Skokie.  2. Wake up at 4 am to erg outside in the yard.  3. Get my HW done for the week.  4. Learn from the mistakes of my last relationship.  5. Think about and get to know Santa Maria better. I like her but seeing as I was just in a relationship, I don't want to rush into things.  More later Eli is outside

      once again my life expressed in song by guess who?   The Patient   A groan of tedium escapes me, Startling the fearful. Is this a test? It has to be, Otherwise I can't go on. Draining patience, drain vitality. This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.  But I'm still right here Giving blood, keeping faith And I'm still right here.  Wait it out, Gonna wait it out, Be patient (wait it out).  If there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. Gonna wait it out.  If there were no desire to heal The damaged and broken met along This tedious path I've chosen here I certainly would've walked away by now.  And I still may ... (sigh) ... I still may.  Be patient. I must keep reminding myself of this.  And if there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. And I still may.  Gonna wait it out.

      It seems that I am pretty bummed out. Breaking up with Daniella didn't seem to do this to me. Well it appears that one of my friends talked to Thai and she said she doesn't like me. I was getting weird signals from her. Sometimes she would be really cool and nice and would act like she wanted to talk to me then other times she would act like she hates me. Well I thought I had a chance but, actually I dont. I mean its fine, I like another girl too. And well I wont say her name but Holy Mary in Spanish! No way Destinos is in spanish who would have known. What was I saying? Oh yes I thought she liked me cuz ever since I told her that I like her she acts like it too but now i know not to waste my time trying to get her. I can take rejection. And I am really starting to like this other girl so I will be ok.

      Ok, once again Abe is single. Usually I would say that it is time to start the active search for a new girlfriend, but I have decided to try something new. I am going to have a passive search for a girlfriend. That means instead of going out and trying to find one I will just sit back and see if any of the girls I know will catch my eye. Since my relationship with Daniella is over I can also be back to normal fliratatious Abe without restrictions. This is good because I can now be myself. I also predict that Jezel thinks I like Maria, because she asked me what I think of her earlier and I pretended not to know what she was talking about. As to the answer to this question...Jezel will just have to wait. Hoo Hoo Hoo Huwahhhh! I told this girl that I like her, but I also told her that I would not go after her. Mabye that was a bad decision but I guess I will find out.

      Dustin I believe it may be the time to reactivate your title of Fag at Arms, you will find out why once you get your head out of ur ass. Khem, ur getting better, but don't say anything to anyone about anything as a general rule. Eli, have fun on retreat, Lily is awaiting your return. Vito I am gonna Kick the crap out of u in the ERG race. Big Jack, u prolly wont see this cuz u dont have electricity in ur house so I am not gonna say anything.

      Oh, great temptress of the east, You come to me as a trojan, Seeming harmless yet causing chaos, You smile at me in the night through the light of Europa, Far in that direction, yet not oriental, Why do you pose to me such a problem, Smaller than most past dealt with, Yet weighs upon my soul as a thousand cannon balls, Of whose twins blast through my heart, Like the emotion that dost inspire me so.

      well I leave with the crew team at 4 pm. So this will probably be my last post until sunday. Just wanna clear up some things first. Chelsea, i am sorry for my last post but u know that i deserve to know. Maria, I could tell you were acting weird 6th, i am gonna ask u whats up after school. Vito, I will be with u on the trip, so i dont have to say anything. Julia, well I know you think its just "Abe being Abe" but its not ask me if u wanna find out more.   As my last statement I would like to quote the band that keeps me sane: Underneath her skin and jewelry, hidden in her words and eyes is a wall that's cold and ugly and she's scared as hell. Trembling at the thought of feeling. Wide awake and keeping distance. Nothing seems to penetrate her. She's scared as hell.  I am frightened to.  Wide awake  and keeping distance from my soul. I am scared like you.

      Getting stabbed in the back by someone you trust is not fun. I am not going to meantion her name, because Chelsea would be pissed if I told everyone how she is totally screwing me over. Luckily I know how to keep things on the Down Low. Chelsea has nothing to worry about because no on knows who I am talking about. Well this person whose name definitely isn't chelsea is letting people screw up my life without telling me who is doing it. Good thing no one knows its Chelsea Fuller the Short, African-American, Thin, Sophomore, who hangs out with Thalia, and is in the cafeteria everyday after school. Otherwise that might be a mess.

      Hola, folks. Its about 11:30 and I just finished a bit of laundry. My mom made me go to church so I was only able to ERG a little. Yesterday I pulled a 7:18.8 2K time which is good for me. (Vito I'm comin after you). At church I wrote a poem, you guys can guess what its about, I will bring it tomorrow. Crap, they are shooting outside, I can hear it. Fuckin gangs piss me off. Yeah and Eli I am gonna kick your ass, cuz I was not makin out with Maria, even though thats not such a bad idea...  Anyway I think its good she and Daniella are friends again, even though they could ally against me in the future. But I am happy. It appears that my blog is being widely read nowadays. Especially the poetry.

      9th period, oh yeah. Well its almost the end of the day and I have to wait here for JUG. I am in the comp. lab with Slavin and I have nothin to do. I fell asleep in 4th, 5th, and 8th periods today. In 4th period the bell rang while i slept and Dustin came and hit me during the passing period to wake me up. I saw Maria's blog last night, it was pretty interesting, I like her but i am still pretty fucked up inside as far as women go. She is pretty hot too. After JUG its time for crew, we came in 3rd and 4th yesterday at Skokie. I will then go home and sleep and do my English. If I feel like it I will ERG before bed and then wake up and pull a 2k before school with a 6k chaser. I need to get through this week and decide what I am gonna do in the way of romance at Detroit. Patience is a virtue. Dustin, I am proud of u for starting to work out, you are gonna be massive as hell when you join crew. Get that 2k time down too! Fuckin 8:49 man u suck even my brother beat you. OK its 2:55 bye.

      I row because I want to move my boat forward. but sometimes I will be moving into a different rhythm and I will begin to rush the slide. When I rush the slide I can take more strokes, but the boat begins to rock to the side and I get all wet. It also cancels out most of the forward movement that I have gone. I think that when i row down the river of life, I should learn to take things slowly.

      Sweat  I'm sweating, and breathing and staring and thinking and sinking deeper. It's almost like I'm swimming.  The sun is burning hot again on the hunter  and the fisherman, and he's trying to remember when, but it makes him dizzy.  Seems like I've been here before.  Seems so familiar. Seems like I'm slipping into a dream within a dream.  Must be the way you whisper.  The sun is setting cool again. I'm the thinker  and the fisherman and I'm trying to remember when but it makes me dizzy. and I'm sweating, and breathing,  and staring and thinking and sinking deeper and it's almost like I'm swimming.  Seems like I've been here before. Seems so familiar.  Seems like I'm slipping into a dream within a dream. It's the way you whisper. It drags me under and takes me home.

      Today was an interesting day. It seems that in the wars between my friends there was lots of action on the front lines. Someone told Maria that Julia likes me. This person is going to be put into a world of pain. Cuz she doesn't and it's not kool to lie about my friends. And especially u ton't tell Maria that stuff. Anyways, I am just chillin I am gonna go to bed and then wake up to pack and clean.

      yes, today was an interesting day. I got to school and chilled with Maria, Dustin, and Jezel. Dustin and Jazel are now dating. I talked to Daniella and she apologized for what she said. Later, when I was waiting for crew, I witnessed her and Maria having another of their now infamous cafeteria arguements. This led Maria to storm off towards the bathroom, prompting me to sprint across the lunch room to catch her just before she entered the ladies room. These little chases seem to be pretty frequent so I think I have to get used to them. I tried to figure out what was going on but, Daniella came over and the arguement ensued. Thai walked by and i gave her a confused look which she returned. Then Maria left once more and I stayed put, I stared at Daniella and she said something which I didn't hear. I left the hallway and Maria walked back in. I went over to Dustin and Jezel and learned that they were together. I ran back to tell Maria. I told her and she and Daniella told me to leave. Thats all I know about that, but I hope all is resolved. I have a regatta in 3 days yippee! I am probably gonna ERG tonight. I will post my time later.

      So, it appears that Maria is my rebound, at least to my all knowing Ex-girlfriend Daniella. And as it seems I am still getting over Phylicia, who I havent talked to for over a month now. She is using her blog to wage some sort of unwritten war on me. Now i could do the thing most would do, which is fire back. but instead of that I choose to let her ramble on in her blog about crap. As long as she doesn't say crap about maria then i won't care. Well Andre, as i have told you, knock urself out, u know i give u my blessing. But after what Vito said i dunno if u want it. Claudie nice blog. Oh yes, Daniella thatnx for coming to the concert, I hope u had fun.

      Yes, Maria said yes to me and we are now dating. I am quite happy about this. I just came back from a chior concert that was a little too long. Tomorrow should be a good day, I finally have crew again. Today we took crew pictures and I was wearing Big Jack's jersey which was like 3 sizes too large so i put on all my clothes over it.

      Ok I am back from the regatta. Its ninth period. I am gonna ask Maria out after school. I hope she says yes. Well as I enjoy what will hopefully be my last few moments of singleness for a while, I am sitting here looking for Minidisc players. Yeah my CD player busted and now i have to find a new way to entertain myself. Dustin cheer up cuz u r acting like a bitch. I know what the polish in ur blg means too. Hahaha. Jezel you are pissing me off with your sadness. I think you and dustin should date each other because you guys would be perfect and it would be a good way to get rid of your respective feelings towards other people. The regatta was fun my 4 came in 4th out of like 40 boats but we still didn't medal. Well I will post later.

      Underneath her skin and jewelry, hidden in her words and eyes is a wall that's cold and ugly and she's scared as hell. Trembling at the thought of feeling. Wide awake and keeping distance. Nothing seems to penetrate her. She's scared as hell.  I am frightened to.  Wide awake  and keeping distance from my soul. I am scared like you

      Its 9th period... Nothing really to do. Everyone graduated so no one is here. I am watching videos, mostly Staind. Right now everything is the same as it has been. Unless I am missing something, which is possible, but unlikely. I am pretty sleepy, I will take a nap after I work out. Update later.

      Just saw Harry Potter, it was good. I think because of the new director the film was alot more mature. Anyway, this raps up another school year for us. Summer is here and that means pointless meanial labor at Ignatius to pay my tuition for eight weeks. It will be OK. I get to work with the Mexican janitors, Sebastian and Simon. Every day I will have lunch with Jezel which should be cool. Sadly Eli is leaving us for the caddy ranch. Sofia on the other hand is leaving us forever. She says she doesn't like it at Ignatius, screw you man I love Ignatius no matter what the general consensus of the freshmen is on my dating life. In terms of that category, nothing really going on there, I don't have anything going on. I am open to suggestions, but I am not going on an active search for a girlfriend. I am not in the mood for drama. Dustin seems to be. LOL. I am sorry man but you have to be a little more agressive. More later.

      Friends, you have witnessed the end of a period. The time has come, while this may not be a new period yet, it is still the end of the old. I am now in a transitionary status, transition to what, is the question. I offically wane off on all activities until i can develop a new plan of action.

      Another composition from the mind of the Rock Thrower:  You gave me the milk and I chugged it, It keeps my bones strong, Fuck, I need all the help I can get, I broke my hip three times in the last three months alone, Grinded my fingers straight down to the bone, Have to admit, It seemed easy at first, Dammit I didnt call her, Its too late. I guess thats what happens when your up at 12:08, But you know i'm crazy anyway, fucked too, I got rivals hounding you everywhere, Like horse shit at the zoo, This other fucker rides a pony, She's stupid, I am too, Because we are prolly gonna be kicked off, Hell, I'm not an Idiot and you're not either, We are pushy sons of bitches, Lets try to have what we can't get, At least I do, Well actually I take a hit, But not a hint, I see you noticed, Fuckin hit my ass, give me a sign, So I don't sleep on the couch with this shit on my mind, I know it drove you crazy when I came in from behind, But I'm sorry, I came on too strong, You see I barely notice, I lift weights all day long, Not Barbels but the ones on my shoulder, I guess I'll get shot down like a BB to a toy soldier.  I'll Give you more later if you want.

      Happy 100th post! Yes who can believe that I have posted 100 times? Not me. And the counter is at 350 which is kool. Anyway, I had a long and fun day today.  The second math portion of the ACT is hard.  Exit Ms. White.  Enter Ms. Gray.  Khem is more trustworthy trhan he once was.  Ms. Red called me today but I was not home.  Happy Birthday Maria.  The bizarro worlds converged and then suddenly split again.  Abe likes a bizarro version of himself.  Alice In Chains is an Awesome band.  Julia if you read this I am sorry for leaving you on the phone for so long.  The Chinkmonk is very widely hated.  Ronald Reagan is in heaven having a chat with Abe Lincoln.  When will the wondering start? We will see.  Red, Gray, Purple.  I realize that I have changed alot this year.  Screwed Over: 1. Eli 2TIE. Dustin 2TIE. Jezel  Screwed Up: 1. Lily 2. Mr. Green Leaf 3. Vito  People Most Likely to change viewpoints in the next 10 days: 1. Jezel 2. Ms. White 3. Vito 4. Abe 5. Mr. Green Leaf  Well sleep beckons. Good night. Any comments? I would love to hear them.

      Ah yes one week of my job down, seven weeks to go. I had an interesting day today. It seems that all of the parellel bizzaro universes are coming back to haunt us. But we shall see. I talked to many people today, including Misses Red, Purple, and White. I have pretty much decided to just observe whatever happens with, and to Ms. White, then give my opinion. Oh yes Khem, you are not Mr. White, because you are not with Ms. White. And there is no Mr. White as of yet just because I said so. That person can be Mr. Leaf Green or something, I don't care. Moving on, I got out of work today pretty early. I then was able to hang out with Vito and Jezel. From Jezel's house I got to talk to a good amount of people. I talked to Sarah, Julia, Claudie, Maria, and Daniella, what an interesting bunch. To me it is obvious that I still have a good amount of feelings for Ms. Purple. I am not sure if going after Ms. Red is a good idea. Eventually Khem and Dustin came over, but shortly after we had to leave because Jezel's dad was coming home. Also, when I was calling all those people, I called Sheila, who acted as if I had slapped Jesus in the face. This annoyed me greatly, and further solidified the idea that Sheila is way to moody to socialize with. After we left we ended up just dropping people off and finally I got home around 9:30. We were gonna do something, but we had no ideas, and the one person we called was not exactly full of stellar plans for our night. Tomorrow is Maria's birthday, Happy Birthday Maria. I will go to her party after the ACT. Predictions:  Hitler Gradually begins to want a trade agreement with Mexico. Lots of negotiations and gradual shifts towards this will occur. Leaving the Former leader of the slavic nation to brood in angst.  Ms. White begins to see old patterns with Mr. Whateverthefuckiwannacallmyself reoccurring, but she will attempt to persevere.  Mr. Blue settles into his work load and begins Erging again. This also allows him to be able to consider his options.  Good night to all, and I hope you all have a good night and weekend.

      Day two of my shitty job has ended. I pretty much sit around and do janitorial work every few minutes. Once in a while I will go off and call someone. Right now I am sitting in college counseling listening to TOOL. Vito is gonna come and we will go to Coldstone. I have never been there before. I called Ms. Purple yesterday from work. Talked for maybe fifteen minutes. Ms. White has definitely gone back where she came from, which means that everything will now gradually shift back to what it once was. I have not spoken to Ms. Red since Friday. I was gonna call her today but I have the banquet, so tomorrow I will. I will just talk to her, because I have not yet made a decision nor formulated a plan of action. My father sent the official copies of my records so my drivers license is getting closer. I got back on the ERG yesterday, I feel very out of shape. I will ERG again tonight. Well I am off to sit in the link. See Ya.

      Its almost time for bed. Another day closes in the life of Abe, even though another began already. Didn't do much today, went to church twice, Mass and 8th grade graduation. I have spent 2 days virtually cut off from my friends, well besides AIM. It has given me time to think. The warzone of my emotions is starting to settle. It is turning into more of a struggle between what can be now and what can be in the future. At current moment I have feelings for 3 girls. All are of the same type amazingly, but they have three distinct personalities. Ms. White is starting to fade from view. Ms. Red has grown greatly in the last week or so. And Ms. Purple has held steady as she has for a long while. Ms. White is starting to express similar tendencies to what I experienced about two months ago. After recieving confirmation of this I examined the evidence and the inability of our romantic outlooks and made the strategic decision not to pursue Ms. White any further. She also seems to be going back to where she came from, just not reverting back to the same state. Ms. Red on the other hand has started to catch my eye. After spending a good amount of time with her, it appears that I have taken a liking to her. I would pursue this path further were it not for one reason, Ms. Purple. Ms. Red and Ms. Purple are associated in a way that if I were to go after either of the two colors, my plight with the other would be squashed indefinitely. Seeing as I have been an admirerer of Ms. Purple for quite a while, it makes sense to want to safeguard that (Potential) relationship. So then why not go after Ms. Purple? FEAR. I have no idea how to even start the process of trying to woo Ms. Purple. It took me more than a fortnight to work up the nerve to broach the subject with her. And just that delimma brought upon me the rails of my peers. "Playing with fire" I believe were the words of one undocumented young chap. Also if I do plunge into this spectrum, I have to deal with the legends of my past. I have respect for whatever constraints a lady places upon her physical person, but sadly that may not be the preconcieved belief. Here I will leave to you my questions. Your opinions are valued greatly.  1) As Ms. White fades into oblivion, do I have the right to comment on her romantic interests as a friend? 2) Has enough time lapsed between my relationship with Ms. White to begin pursuing other options? 3) Is any potential relationship with Ms. Purple enough reason to not pursue Ms. Red? 4) If I am to bar myself Ms. Red, does that mean I should work up the balls to go after Ms. Purple. 5) Is sitting back and doing nothing a good idea?  Please answer these questions by clicking on the comments button under this post. Or if you would like to keep your response private E-Mail me at xomiax@yahoo.com. Thanx

      No one sees this the way I do, It pains me to see that you would think for me, Why do you play with the strings of my ego? Giving me reason to doubt your motives, I know of a time that no longer exists to you, And its being, is of something unfamiliar with me, Yet my situation seems as old as the sun, And as lasting as time, So whom should I trust with my secrets? The one who I have known for a year, The one that whispers in my ear, Or the one who wants me from afar? Where upon my mind does this lay? That I should be frustrated, Yet ignorant of what causes me to be this way,

      More musings from the Rock Thrower: i don't quite understand what makes me tick, something provokes me beyond the limit, mabye it's the weather, it was overcast, but now its getting bloody, it could be that i can't have what i want, especially if its royalty, give me reason give me limits, because i am about to exceed my bounds, so you better bind me a little tighter, so it wont be as bad when i snap

      Ah the day closes. It has been a long day for me. I am currently talking to Dustin about his problems with his ladyfriends. I probably should be concentrating on mine. Gray, Purple, Red. The colors of a rainbow that is filled with emotion and yet hurtles rocks at my coinscience. I may not know what to do. I have not talked to Ms. Red since Friday so i dunno about that anymore, plus the whole purple problem. I haven't talked to Ms. Purple since Friday either, although I did call her today to no avail. I haven't talked to Ms. Gray since Saturday but that is also when she came back into the picture. I wish I could talk to her, but sadly she is kind of on lockdown. I am not sure why, but it may have to do with The Chinkmonk. This also poses another problem, it appears that she can't go out so when am I supposed to see her? I will try and figure that out as more information becomes available. I hope I can figure something out. Comments are welcome.

      One more day has passed. I don't feel like writing a formal post so my style may change rapidly. Today was a good day at work, I was very sleepy though. Simon yelled at me to stay awake alot. I need more sleep. Ms. Purple read my blog. She knows who she is, and thats quite alright with me. Eventually I will reveal the code to the masses. I do not have much information to give out now. Most of what I know is still in its raw form. But as of now and for the near future, there is nothing going on. But just in case I will put myself into "Passive" mode. This means I am not going to go out looking for a girlfriend, I am just staying put and sitting and taking in the surroundings. Not really sad, but not happy either. As I have said before, we shall see what becomes of this.  The computer project is going slow. I was hoping to finish tonight, but the drivers screwed me over. I am now hoping to finish by Saturday. Vito, its not a good idea. If I did that I would be spilling blood, and that blood would be my own. And I would be royally screwed. It is probably to late for you, but not for me. Tick Tock Tick Tock. Today was a quick day and it has only been one of what could be many, but time is moving slowly. I wish it would go faster but who would wish for the end to come sooner. Unless it is not the end...

      OK. After some deliberation, I have decided to take the plunge and go after purple. Now I did hear your comments on this, and I know none of you advocated this move. But I would like to repond by saying: "Fuck That". now I know it has been mentioned that I may become angry because of the lack of "stuff". I don't think this will be a problem. First I have to actually court her and get her to like me. That will be my main problem. Then I can proceed from there. Also you guys know that i am not gonna force a girl to do anything she does not wanna do. Another thing is that i really like Purple, I could never do anything to her. Also purple gave me the advice to abstain from dating anyone for a month, which will be completed on Tuesday. Now here are some major hurdles I have to overcome: Firstly, I know that I like her alot, but sadly you can't have a successful one-way relationship. I need to figure out whether she likes me or not, or if she would go for me. I plan to run some probes on this later in the week. Secondly, we do not live near each other. I would have to hang out with her in the city. This would require her to take the train in or her parents to drop her off. I do not know whether or not she or they would be willing to do this. Of course I would be willing to go there, but I do not know how to get there. I am getting a car in early August, which would make things much more easy, but that does not help me now. Thirdly, and most importantly, I have to deal with my crappy reputation. Now I know Purple is not one to just believe whatever she hears, but she also has common sense. She knows that most people believe that "Birds of a Feather flock together". Even though I may have made a few mistakes, I was going through something, and I know that I made some decisions that were not the best option at the time. The difference now is that I have learned from those mistakes. The spreading of false rumors should not be a problem because school is out and there is no one to propogate lies. So as I head off in this direction, i sincerely hope that I will do what is best. I will make as few mistakes as possible. I certainly hope this turns out for the best.   Comments would be appricated.

      Hmmm... today it seems will be the kick off to what could prove an interesting week. Gray is away, I plan to hang out with Red a little. Also things from the past may make a comeback. Well I cannot predict the future. Our glow-in-the-dark friend Dustin is away on his summer service project, probably falling in love with some hillbilly.

      The eleventh installment from The Rock Thrower:  Sitting and thinking aloud These feelings no longer am I able to shroud So listen. Please won't you listen. Aching and wasting the day It must be good to be so far a way You know it. Oh God you know it. Its been so long since we were there, Time helps you drift away from me, Can you speed it up? Its been so long since I beared my soul, Tell me you have something to say to me, Or do you care at all?  Ranting and showing my mind You thinking you had been left behind Hear me. Why don't you hear me? You tell me to give you time How long do I have to wait on the line? I'm Waiting. So tired of waiting. Its been so long, since we talked at all, How can you think without talking to me, Or will you think at all? It's been so long so decide my fate, I'm drowning here pull me up to breathe, Or just let me fall.

      Well I know my posting has been sporadic lately, but I have many reasons for this. I have been staying at my Godfather's house for the last few days. Also work takes up a significant portion of my time. Work is getting better because I am effectively slacking off and taking naps. I have been hanging out with Giselle alot because she has summer school. I have been to two crew practices and I definitely need to work on my form to get it back up to par. But at least I am not rushing my slide and causing the boat to lean to starboard. Ms. grey is back from her trip, reportedly a little darker. She still seems to be locked up in her house so I don't need to repeat what effect this has. Dustin, don't deny that even if I were to pursue that course of action, this would be a major roadblock. mabye we would be together but we would never be near each other. So be quiet about it, i have made my choice even if i am doomed to failure. Anyway, I have not talked to Ms. Purple since Saturday. I called her a few times but it was to no answer. So as far as i know, nothing has changed. I have gone to a few crew practices, My form is a little off but I can get it back up to the level it once was at with practice. I really wanna buy an XBOX, hopefully I will make enough money when I work for Mr. Magana. I know it is pretty hard to get in touch with me now, so I would suggest you send me an E-Mail if you want to talk. xomiax@yahoo.com is my address. A new piece of poetry should be published later today, so look out for it. Also anyone wanting to know how I get along, find lyrics for the song "The Patient" from Tool's Lateralus album.

      Hmmm. I know it is past 2 am, but i will still post. Today, i left work at noon. Sebastian left so i did too. I don't think they will notice i am gone. I walked around with Jezel. We went to her house and then Khem, the B-Day boy, arrived about 15 mins later. Dustin Laurence and Sam came in the ensuing hours. Dustin left twice because Jezel was making fun of him. Both times I got him to come back. We left her house at 7:30, and headed off for Wall's. Dustin did not wanna come, so we then headed for the train. Laurence had to go home, so it would only be the three of us and Wall. Wall picked us up from 95th street and we went to his house and chilled. Eli said he was coming, but he never showed up. His mom called Khem and i talked to her, imay have screwed him over by accedent, but its his fault for not letting her know where he is. Why does Mrs. Magana always lose Eli when he comes home? I hope he went back to the ranch. This kid named Tommy came over Wall's and he seemed kool. He is a storyteller, and i think Wall may have picked up this trait from him. He speaks well and vividly. We played Halo, which is quickly becoming one of my favorie games. (Anyone selling an XBOX? Will pay cash.) Khem had to be home by 12, so we had to leave. We drove home and here i am now. Work has been OK, i am getting morte into the routine. My brother is home now so I am not on as much. I am more than halfway done. As far as girls go I am on a due course east. I can keep the sails as they are but i am considering, moving a few and maybe adding somemore to get the boat moving faster. not that the journey has not been great. i think i need to stop comparing Girls to things. War, Rowing, Sailing... etc. Tomorrow Khem's B-day blast extravaganza continues with a riveting game of pin the tail on the donkey. Hopefully all of my bros can come. Well i am off to bed. Hope u have a good weekend.

On Fiscal Issues, you rank as a Strong Liberal (18).  Your score is on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being fully liberal and 100 being fully conservative.

      Last post was kind of incoherant. There was about 2 lines that should have been omitted. You guess which ones. Its understandable if you do a little research. Ask Jezel, she tried, i dunno how far she will get. Game Systems do not equal Girls.   KORN Give him something to say.  Something super fly, never play.  All I hear is disgrace.  Erase them all and reclaim my place.  All is not the same and yet it is still singular. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore is a bastard. he twists alot of facts around. Kerry is too, he believes life begins at conception, but still supports abortion.   KORN You're gonna die!  What made me whine?  I wish I hadn't drank.  Inside your soul escapes  Circular, back where I began. I would like to live in a community that is black and white mixed together. Mix and Fade. The computer still is not working, i need to get it running soon.  KORN Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.   Athena, Minerva, who ever the hell you are, reach out to me. Because I want to kick the crap out of Aphrodie.  Stop this constant pestering. I think the clouds are moving away, even though the rain may be needed.      Funny  It's been two weeks since I have been a computer technician. It is not that bad to be out of work. Things change as you get older, some things are good. Lance Armstrong is back in France. That guy is awesome. Should start ERGing.   TOOL I am just a worthless liar. I am just an imbecile. I will only complicate you. Trust in me and fall as well. I will find a center in you. I will chew it up and leave, I will work to elevate you just enough to bring you down.   Perception, may not be what you are. But it is how you are seen. People make assumptions. Pushover. Manwhore. etc...  TOOL Something has to change. Un-deniable dilemma. Boredom's not a burden Anyone should bear.  That's not the reason why I am doing this. It's just my current state. Things are rooted in the past, i was once entertained but I was still distracted. And now commonly detracted from. Screw you, and screw those who say one thing and do another. Stay away from those who wish to find attention, when they find it it will attend to you. Good or Bad. Screw the Blink. Keep your fucking eyes shut.  TOOL Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity. Calculate what we will or will not tolerate. Desperate to control all and everything. Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  The first words are great. Don't you dare call yourself a fan. Beat off and Beat up. thats what happened and how you will be if you don't stop. it's your life. Your not a "playa". so shut up.  ********************************PLAN******************************  TOOL A groan of tedium escapes me, Startling the fearful. Is this a test? It has to be, Otherwise I can't go on. Draining patience, drain vitality. This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old.  But I'm still right here Giving blood, keeping faith And I'm still right here.  Wait it out, Gonna wait it out, Be patient (wait it out).  If there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. Gonna wait it out.  If there were no desire to heal The damaged and broken met along This tedious path I've chosen here I certainly would've walked away by now.  And I still may ... (sigh) ... I still may.  Be patient. I must keep reminding myself of this.  And if there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. And I still may.  Gonna wait it out.  *****Thats the plan*****

      4th of July. My mom came home a day early, liberating me from exile at my godfather's house. I hated living there. Anyway, all i did today was go to church and clean. Not much of a celebration. I couldn't go out until my mom got in and she came in at 6:30 not 2 as origionally planned. So basically i sat here all day doing nothing. Church was alot better than usually. Probably cause i payed attention. Talked to red, no longer a factor. I am pretty sleepy. Vito is off living his Irishness to the fullest. Dustin was PMSing tonight, i don't know why. Jezel blocked him. I want to buy an XBOX. I found a new one for 60 bucks online. kevin Quinn just IMed me. I am hoping that Jim Edgar runs for Senate, he was an awesome governor from what i remember. My glasses get dirty very easily. I might want to change my profile picture. its not like I dont like the album alot, I just have decided to put something else in. Sleep is calling. I wonder how things are going for Dustin and Melissa. I am finished with half of my work for the summer. I do not want to work for 4 more weeks though. I need to go get my license now. To the anonymous person who left the comment, i thank you. I am not going the guilt route, that is low, i simply posted a poem on my blog. My blog tells people how i feel, and i am not going to get into this, but for a similar viewpoint look  urlLink here.  Thats basically it besides the personal shit. Korn is a great band. I have crew in the morning, it is gonna be fun. I should probably be getting to sleep now. But I will type a bit more. My good headphones broke sadly. i need some more now. Sorry you guys about the Aim indvasions, I have just been trying to get them to work. When I do, I will use it sparingly and on people who deserve it, like Jen Broome. Playstation Portable or Nintendo DS? I would go for the DS right now, and that would be a lock if it has a big storage capacity. Things can be different. life is fluid and currents flow. Never stagnant. Jars of Clay Much Afraid 2. Its possible, but it definitely depends on what else happens. NIGHT. Happy 4th of July. R.I.P. Ronald Reagan.

      I know, I have not posted in a while.&nbsp; This is just gonna be a post where I get a few things done. Like put up pictures of Eli and Jack:   &nbsp; Went out today with some friends. I had fun. I have been waging this war for a while now, and I feel like an old Japanese fighter who still thinks the war is on. People are saying its over and yet I seem unwilling to listen. Wait lets go LIVE to CSPAN: &nbsp; Speaker: The next order of buisness, is the enactment of the "I still may" clause from document "The Patient" 03 Tool-Lateralus. We will have opening remarks from the gentleman from the south, Representative Longrod. &nbsp; Before Rep. Longrod speaks lets have a short break...

      i was gonna write a poem about being nocturnal But no words came to my mind Awake at night on the computer I read the screen making me blind.  I thought I had a poem but for some reason it just did not come to me. Well It is 0300 Central Standard Time, and I have nothing much to write. I ERGed today, I am adding 5 mins a day until I get to 45. Crew practice for today is cancelled because no one can find Will. I am getting better at Yahoo Pool, but I still lose to the Intermediates. If I am online I would love to play you guys so make sure you challenge me. And I found out that TOOL is a kind of Rock called Progressive Metal. I looked up some other Prog. Metal bands and I found Dream Theater, which seems good so far (Not as good as TOOL though). Apparently Rush was one of the greatest Prog. Metal bands out there, so I might do Mr. Madden a favor by listening to some more of it. What I heard before sucked, but it was randomly downloaded tracks off WinMX. Jezel told me that Sober from TOOL's Undertow album was on the radio, most likely they are playing tool again because they are working on a new album. I can't wait for this new album to come out. I will probably end up goin in the morning to buy it when it comes out. But that will be a while so i might as well not think about it. I am mysteriously not that tired and quite energetic. Tomorrow I have my Senior pictures up on the northside at 3. The place where it is is very close to Indiatown, so I may stop there, or i will go chill with Jezel or Vito. Who knows? Dustin and Keli seem to have taken a liking to each other. thsi is good but they still have not seen each other face to face. i think you should take her out as you did Melissa. Maybe you will get lucky and get some great hand-holding action. LOL. You know I am just playing. If all goes well I will too. But only time will tell. The Cat seems to be very lonely. She has alot dammit alot alot alot of room in her litterbox to share. She needs someone to share it with. i propose we set her up with Dennis just so he can have something to play with. Actually I wouldn't do that. Dennis has great things in his future, I have no doubt. Khemmit good luck there is a bell and i hope you ring it as loud as humanly possible. I may start declassifying some of the old colors because they are no longer relevent. I know I cant spell. TOOL- 46 & 2 from the Aenima album embodies my feelings right now. Just the magic of music for you. Things are well, quiet for me now but well. i have not talked to purple in a few days, hell no one reads my long posts, I have not talked to Julia in a few days. Julia if you are reading this read my blog title. No new information as to whats going on there. Maybe I should ask, maybe I should wait. No matter what I do I know I will pester Chelsea about it and ask her opinion. Which will most likely be "Why don't you just realize its never going to happen?" The I will launch into a speech, causing her to sigh. On a completely unrelated subject, it appears that the liberals have spent 82 percent more on the election campaign than the republicans have. Amazing who is gonna outspend whom? The problem is that we have all of these liberal oppurtunist groups out there who like to complain about whatever there is in America. Just wait until Abortion is criminalized, that will be the day of triumph. Don't get me started on the gay issue. I need to see Spiderman 2.  > Well I am off to bed I hope you all have a good week.

      The 13th installment from the Rock Thrower:  It is too late for this I am not supposed to be here My bed is calling to me Why do i linger awake?

      I hope thats close enough. i did not do much today. my mom said because I was out yesterday, i needed to spend time with her. I told her that it was pointless because she would clean and then go to sleep. Which she did. So i just stayed home. I am having a TOOL- Ænima marathon. At this moment I am near the end of my sixth time listening to the CD straight through, in a row. I am getting sleepy. So I will write a poem for you.  Stop whining about whats not there Be happy for what exists Because you did not have to be You were given life We live better than the world Yet we whine more by far Much is given and required So perk up you spoiled idiot You have no reason to complain Just appriciate what you have  I am not sure if that is a poem. It is meant to be but I don't know. It's my first one in a while thats not about the Dinosaur's skin. Well today I will have church and probably go out with my mom. Open for ideas, about things to do after.

      Yeah, I am on break. It is 10 am here in the Beigel room. And it's also about 1000 degrees here. I have not had a real post in a few days mainly because I have not had enough time in one set state of being for a long post. Nevertheless, the evnts of the past week should come to a head this weekend. Sadly I cannot chill with Dustin, Giselle, or Maria because of the party situation. Nor can I chill with Khem, who is now a turtle permanently, because he has to clean the house. Vito and Eli are both gonna be away also. So I believe I am gonna chill with Vesty, Sierra, Lily Sam and Ben on Saturday. We are going to some sort of dance thing at Melinnium Park, for which I must find a date. I have about a week and a half until I go to Ohio, in this time I need to get my license otherwise my dad will be quite pissed at me. I am sure there is a question which some people are asking, and no I will not address it in this post. I have crew today, and there are lots of clouds outside which could prevent rowing. Yeah the cloud coverage is pretty thick. So many clouds. Well I'm off.

      Well, I have a few minutes so I thought I would post. I have had a good week. I got my driver's license, and in a few hours I will have a car. My flight is #1004 from Midway so if u wanna wave goodbye I am leaving at 1130. Damn the sox are 4 back. But at least its not 10.5. Well yesterday afternoon i snuck off to see Maria, even though my mom said I couldn't go. I was happy to see her finally and it still has me in a good mood. Khem called me at 6 this morning. And last night I talked to Vito for 90 mins, and no not about bags a Giselle says. Dustin called me while I was talking to Michelle, and I forgot to call her back. Dustin said that his mom does not want us hanging around him if we are gonna put him through shit. So we settled it and agreed that he was wrong for trying to block Maria from seeing me and I was wrong for ruining his honeymoon, although it was justifiable payback. I am gonna miss you all alot. And Maria I am going to miss you especially because I have wanted to see you. Now I have and I am leaving. So I am all fired up and going to be 250-500 miles away. But I will be back in 2 1/2 weeks, and i will see you then. Well I am off, as you all know I will be incommunicae until i have a computer built for my dad. So I will see you all.  urlLink xomiax@yahoo.com

      This may be my last post for a while. So I better make it good. I guess I will explain what is going on right now in my life. I have one last day of work left. Today I spent the day mostly sleeping and having weird dreams and random flushes of emotion in the Brunswick room. I was supposed to go to the movies but that plan failed, although I did eventually go. I got my driver's license yesterday, while taking the test I forgot the speed limit and the lady took off points for going too slow. Friday I am going to fly to Ohio where I will recieve my very own car, a 1993 Buick Lasabre, which I will drive back to Chicago in the middle of august. As far as girls go I am single. Ms. Purple has joined all of the colors of the past leaving only one color to be found. Well now that it is singular I guess a color code is no longer necessary. So Ms. grey is.............Maria. But, don't expect any quick movements there because I will be away. She was supposed to come to the movies with me but i don't feel like explaining what happened...&nbsp;I will post at work. Oh email me ur addresses and i will write u letters because my dad does not have a computer that is in working order. it will take me a few days to build him one. xomiax@yahoo.com

       Well I am having a good time here in New Jersey. Today I went to new york and I had fun. Unfortuanately I was unable to chill with Kehm. NY is quite dirty, and it smells like the back of a Cracker Barrel, which is not very appealing. Tomorrow I am going to Boston and I will have fun there. I bought a present for Giselle, I think she will like it. Apparently I ruined Dustin's life, but I am not gonna sweat it since it would be proly the 30th time I have ruined it. He should be happy though because it appears he is holding hands with Keli as I type these words. I know what is gonna happen to me and Maria when I return, but know one knows that I know. Thats the magic of typing in Wingdings, No one knows what u know. I have my theories as to why this will occur, but I will save those for later posts where I can use this to its full comic potential.  Webdings Biatch

      Tonight, we will start our trek to the east coast. We are gonna leave at midnight so we get to Philla at about 10 am. I do not know what we will do from there, but I am certain we will visit New York. There I may hook up with Khem depending on time constraints. I would like to see the statue of liberty. I don't feel like finishing so I will leave it at that.  Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  bye

      Once again, I am here in the library. Tomorrow we will leave at night for the east coast. Not much to say... Oh yeah, Eagle Insurace= $671 for 6 months, but at that rate I cannot get it until the middle of September. I will try and work on my dad and I may get it sooner if lucky. I hope you all are well.

      Yeah, I am here. I am enjoying myself. If you wanna know where I am then go to the map of Ohio and find the space where there is nothing. It's called Wapakoneta, just south of Lima. If you wanna call me just ask Jezel for my #. But make sure you leave a message cuz we screen our calls. In a few days time we will be leaving for the East Coast, it should be fun. We tried to get the car insured for me today, but sadly because I live in Illinois I cannot be put onto my dad's policy. He has to sign over the car to me and I have to put it in my name. Well I had better find some cheap insurance. Any suggestions? I wrote a letter to Jezel, and also one to Maria. The effects of the latter shall prove interesting. I saw the Village and it kicked ass. That is what being Indian can do for you. Well I am off........ Oh and I will not be online because I can only use the comp at the library.
