      Fuck you BPI. Copying the RIAA. I mean, fair play, you don't want people downloading too much music, it means you don't get as fat pay checks. A number of bands have claimed they don't give 2 shits if you are downloading their music, as long as you give themm some money. I used to download quite a lot, but I don't any more, and I'm starting to buy albums. A friend of the dad of a friend got the following message from the BPI:   [BPI] WARNING, The file-sharing network you are connected to indicates that you are offering music to others from your computer.

      I like ska, even though it isn't cool. It's fun, upbeat bouncy music to dance to. And that's why I like it.  For those of you not in "the know", here is a brief summary of the history of ska:  Ska started in the early 60's in Jamacia as a fusion of mento and jazz. This kind of ska is called trad ska. It's fun. Bands include: The Skatalites, Toots and Maytals, and Bob Marley. Then later it moved to the UK, and the Specials' keyboard player set up a label called 2tone, which was very influential, yadda yadda yadda. This kind of ska is often called 2tone. Bands include: The Selecter, The Toasters, Madness, The Specials and the Ska-Dows. Then it went to the US, specifically SoCal, and Revival started. It's cool. Often called ska-punk. Bands: Less Than Jake, Reel Big Fish, Hippos, Suburban Legends, Forces of Evil, Jeffries Fan Club. etc. etc.  Currently listening to Bandits of the Acoustic Revolution  Here are the mp3 from their 5 track EP, A call to Arms:  1.  urlLink Intro  2.  urlLink Here's to Life  3.  urlLink Dear Sergio:  4.  urlLink It's A Wonderful Life  5.  urlLink They Provide The Paint For The Picture-Perfect Masterpiece That You Will Paint On The Insides Of Your Eyelids  [what a name!]  Enjoy.  Hmm.. the links are down. If you want the songs add me on MSN.  Check out  urlLink Turn Up The Ska ! It's a cool radio station that plays ska.
