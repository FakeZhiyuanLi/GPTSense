      Well actually it should say Rude Boyz! But I was in the mood for a Duran Duran reference.  Friday is finally here and I'm a bit poste. Went to fire in Vauxhall last night for Rude Boyz (basically it's a night for lads who like hackett tops, trackie bottoms etc). Had a great time. Much of which is either unprintable or would land me in jail (alledgedly). It's a really good horny night with top tunes and top totty. Although the ametuer scally strip thing was a bit like Blind Date with Burberry...  So whats up this weekend? Well I think S'wellen's dragging me into town for a beer tomorrow *hic*. And that's about as far as my plans go.  7 days from now I'll be in Manchester - LA LA LA  Great weekend Y'all!  Mike x

      I'm soooooo excited cos It's a week and two days til I'll be up in my spiritual home for the weekend (No not Grimsby). MANCHESTER!  Yes that city of cities. Home to the Stone Roses, the Early Nineties club scene, Queer as Folk, Coronation Street (best soap ever!), and of course Bridget Madeline Aherne. Who? I hear you ask. Well Old Ma Aherne is one of my very very closest friends, we've seen each other through thick and thin, had huge screaming rows in the street that always end when one of us cracks up after not talking for about 15 minutes, worshipped cheap wine together, lived, laughed (usually at each others questionable shags) and cried with each other since UNI and have a bond that can never be broken.  Ok enough with the gushy stuff, next Friday Manchester Mardi Gras starts, and I'm tying it in with a visit to Ma. she's probably worried cos she hasn't seen me since Feb that I'm not eating properly or something. Am also so looking forward to seeing Chris 'Mophead' Marshall (B's other half and as cunning as me on the old 'Slack around in life but still fall on your feet' Stakes). And Young Philip Leijiten (OZ Phil). Young Philip left London town for the bright lights of Manchester were he was found wandering by Ma and taken under her wing. From what I gather he's survived his first experience of her PMT, so whoring round Canal Street every night should be Knats Piss.  Okay for those not in the know, hear are the top 10 reasons you should revere Manchester as a city among cities;  1) It's the UKs second city - That's pretty damn good!  2) It's only 40 mins from Huddersfield, and less than an hour from Leeds, which made my university years so much more fun than just having Wakefield nearby  3) It has some of the most stunning industrial age architecture in the country. Take a look at some of the Uni buildings to see what I mean, and the G-Mex (Old train station)  4)Madchester - Need I say more?  5)The Hacienda and the whole of rave culture exploded out of this city and refused to die. Pity they're building flats there now to sell to the same people that used to club there.  6)Man Utd - Ok I'm not a football fan, but they did rule the roost throughout the nineties to become the most famous football team in the world! Plus It gave us a lot to ogle at!  7)Canal Street - It's like Soho, only the people are friendly and don't try and screw each other over. The night of soooo many drunken staggerings, mashed up clubbings, karaoke at Churchills, convincing bouncers we are actually a 'gay majority group' and taking over piano bars wherever we can find them.  8) The New Union - Ok it's part of canal street but It ROCKS. Where else in the country can you stand with a can of red stripe wearing sports kit and actually get the attention of the fit guys? Also home to random Irish drunks, people with dogs, and strippers that strip to 'Rock me Amadeus'.  9) Metrolink - It's a tram, but it's so much more! Takes you all the way to the Lowry and Salford quays. And it has crazy named stations like 'Pomona' and 'Shudehill'.  10) Last but by no means least - The Mancunian Way. To some it's just a road. But to the ones that built it it's a symbol of toil and achievement. Pretty much sums Manchester up.

      Happy monday everyone - Todays title is a Darren Hayes reference. More on that later!  Am thankfully and miraculously feeling fresh as a daisy dispite my packed weekend:   Friday  - Met Sue Ellen for drinks after work with all his media luvvie friends, then we went to the ever gorgeous Lynettes for a dinner party (Read:got drunk as skunks, totally mashed up, and danced on the window ledge for the amusement of Brixton bus station, followed by us collapsing and Glinda humping the sofa in her sleep.) We also saw some junkies in Brixton shooting up - my first addicts! But the evening was fantastic and the lady deserves a gold medal in hostessing.   Saturday  - Woke up bloody early due to the beast that is the Brixton clock. Couldn't move until we'd had at least two cups of tea (which we sent Glinda off to do, best to keep her in her place) and a generous helping of Tarte au Citron (Home baked by Sue-Ellen of course. I always knew she'd use her GCSE Home economics one day). Then went home and monged in front of UK Golds Bill weekend for a bit, it was much better when it was half an hour long. This was deftly followed by a jaunt into town to meet my mates Ian, Derv and Warren and go drinking (which we did with gusto). Ended up in Bar Code Via Shinky Shonky and then back at Dervs house for a chill. Saturday then blurred into...   Sunday  - We got home from being out at 9:30 am, Glinda appeared around the same time with three clicks of her Ruby Slippers - I got the bus. Would have gone to bed but we decided carrying on drinking was a better idea (I was put in my place by Glindas command of "get me a vodka bitch!"). Much vodka, wine, CD burning, Dominos pizza, CSI double bill, Most Haunted, Darren Hayes and a nice massage later (the last two bits thanks to the talented man that is Adam - sexy Cock-er-ney that he is. Well when I say thanks I mean more for the massage than orgasming every time Mr Hayes Appeared on TV. And the song's now stuck in my head) and we went to bed about 12, after I'd had to catch the big spider and throw it out cos Mark was shrieking like a girl.  Mum, was back from holiday as well this weekend, so It was good to speak to her after a week. I am a complete Mummys boy after all.    Cloggy the Ghost

      No that wasn't a request, but we did see the closest thing to a Gay Chav celebrity last night, and the only people to use this postings title as a chat up line (according to one of their many interviews in the Gay Rags): The ever Hacketted 'Fierce Girl'. They were 'avin it large' (I believe thats the term the kids are using nowadays) in G-A-Y bar, where myself and my female companion, Lady Victoria of Tameside, were quoffing todays ale at yesterdays prices while wondering exactly what the guy in the orange dungarees with the limp was on (maybe it was day release), and what smell the guy next to us was trying to mask by spraying CK1 every 30 seconds.  The fierce girl collective, if you've never heard of them. Are a couple of lads who trade on their council chic and mash it with being gayers - and are planning to assault the charts with their first single 'Double Drop' on the 16th (which has some very good remixes!). They're both quite shaggable actually, but they're a bit like Eminem in that you can't tell whether their being ironic or serious in their hype. However I'm generally fabourable to them, lucky for me I had my 3/4 length Adidas bottoms on so i felt fierce as well. Here's a link to find out more:  urlLink Http://www.redflagrecords.com/fiercegirl.html   Other highlights of the night included Vicki and myself trying to recreate the All Saints 'Pure Sures' video on her cameraphone, and our discussion as to whether anyone has actually seen 'Desperately Seeking Susan' all the way through. We suspect that like us, most people watch it on BBC2 when they're in on a Saturday and fall asleep roughly 20-30 minutes into it. If anyone can disprove this theory please drop me a line as the University of Plaistow are doing a study...  Mike x

      What a b***ard! - Some blooming company that got my number from somewhere has been charging me £1.50 to receive text messages (I was getting some that said *unable to display picture. But i assumed they were from someone with a picture phone, IE one of my mates).  So I'm now £10 down on my phone credit :(  GITS...  Anyway the nice lady at Orange gave me their contact details and I rang and gave them what for and it should noe be ceased forthwith. Moral of the day is don't give your number to strange people (unless he's cute of course). You'd think I'd know that in my job by now...  Egads!  Mike x

      Saw The Stepford Wives last night with Mark - Absolutely fantastic!  Now I know there are a purist group who like the original, but that was a thriller, and while this follows roughly the same storyline. It's a high camp comedy romp. And it had us in stitches. I don't know why I've never seen Bette Middler (Bobbi) and Nicole Kidman (Joanna) working together before, but they had great chemistry as the good guys, joined by Roger Bart as their hilarious homo mate (also called Roger). They set about to solve the mystery of why the wives of stepford are so perfect. And the three of them get so many comedy lines it's untrue   Examples are...       Joanna Eberhard: But, she had sparks coming out of her ears!   Roger Bannister: That's the first sign.    Joanna Eberhard: Of what?    Roger Bannister: Cheap jewelery.   And...               Joanna Eberhart: How do I look?  Bobbi Markowitz: Can I be perfectly honest?    Joanna Eberhart: Mm-hmmm.  Bobbi Markowitz: You kind of look like Betty Crocker.  Joanna Eberhart: I know.        Roger Bannister: At Betty Ford          Or          Roger Bannister:What am I wearing? (On being 'de-stepfordised' and realising he's dressed as a republican candidate and has thrown all his Gucci away)         Run! Go see now if you already haven't. And the original is worth a dusting down. I'm sure Channel 5 will be showing it soon (probably with the DIRE sequel. The Stepford Husbands, and whatever the third one was. If anyone knows what it was I'll give them an apple)                 Dynasty on a Budget?     Speaking of Channel 5. As of next month they're repeating Sunset Beach. Yes that show that was so bad it rocked will be back on our screens (It also got me through sixth form and uni).     Marvel at a day lasting a week, try and work out who the  killer  is, watch the  turkey baster  incident with your breath held (I'm not kidding), lust after  Cole , laugh at the  ugly Spelling kid  with the huge forehead rapping, and find out why  Annie  is the best soap baddie since Alexis removed her gloves and those Gucci glasses to destroy Blakes defense in Dynasty...    Hey and the weather is back to hot! Woo Hoo!     Mike x

      Just a quick hi to my flatmate Mark (the Lovely Glinda). Who I said I'd give a mention to today. Bless him he's finally got a decent tan without the use of rubber gloves or gravy block. And he looks darn sexy for it as well.  Well the weather is having an identity crisis as well, rain, heat, rain, heat, rain?! Oh well at least it's not cold.  Got my best mate Mark "Sue-Ellen" Holding round tonight for tea and a gossip. (and to watch Clue - quite possibly the funniest film of the 80s - well intentionally funny, Grease 2 was funny for all the wrong reasons). This evening is bound to deteriorate due to our penchant for bargain bin wine at rocket fuel strength. Well at least we don't pretend we have any class I guess...  Mike x

      Well I finally got round to getting myself a blogspot. It'll be handy for me as much as anyone to know what I've been upto.  What a great weekend.  Went to Balans on friday for a delicious slap up meal topped off with irish coffee and brandy. Then back to bed earlyish for the next days festivites...  Brighton Pride on saturday was the most fabulous day I've had for a long time. The day started with a cooked brekkie at Dan and Stu's fabby new pad. Followed by a very nice train complete with the nice people at South Central (trains, not Dukes) decking out ' H  a  p  p  y   P  r  i  d  e ' carriages.  Got to the park and generally had a great day. Got nicely out of it and thought we were in Greece for half an hour or so. Which was nice. (although not that out of it to know that the lesbian couple with the baby that were taking MDMA while in charge of said baby was seriously    WRONG  ! )  Then more merriment and dancing (we were taking bets on how many times we would hear Lolas theme, which incidentally as any gayer will know we've had in clubs for about a year and are so past.) Before we shot off for the train back to Londinium. Deftly followed (well I say deftly. The train home took about two hours and stopped at every Lamp post, plus Dan was having a personal nirvana in trying to find a cashpoint near Victoria) by a couple of cheeky ones in Barcode and then onto XXL. Which was a good laugh.  More drinks and Chilling back at Dan and Stu's flat followed by three hours sleep meant yesterday was pretty much a write off. Was back home monging on the sofa and asleep by nine last night - what a good boy am I...  More wry comments and comedy when I think of some (hey it's Monday!)  Mike x
