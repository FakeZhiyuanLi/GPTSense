						   Her mother had this knack of opening the door , without knocking first of course, whilst she was in some state of undress.  "You don't know how to come out and help serve dinner is it? Am I your maid?"  Wanxin sighed.  "Ma...I just came home. Let me change first please?"  Her mother slammed the door shut and went about herding her flock of 4 other children, her mother-in-law (who was terribly hard of hearing) and husband to the dinner table.   Wanxin remembered how her mother wasn't like that. Wasn't so angry with everyone and wasn't so angry about everything. She was well dressed, soft spoken and cultured. Wanxin was in awe of her and always wanted to be like her mother who would smile graciously at her guests and proudly display her eldest daughter to them. Wanxin would smile shyly as they fussed about her and she'd hide behind her mother's skirt. Her mother would bend down and kiss her on the forehead.  Those days felt so distant in their 5-room flat. Too small for their family with too little privacy. She shared the room with her Ah Ma (who snored loudly) and her brothers squeezed into another room. Her parents had their own bedroom but her father often slept outside in the living room because he wanted to watch football at night. Besides, his baby boy would wake up shrieking at night for milk and the noise grated on him.  Her father wasn't really her father. He was her step father. Mother had remarried shortly after her Dad had passed on.   Those were dark days. Her mother was pregnant with her third brother, Junxiong, and her second brother, Junfeng, was always hit by asthma attacks. Like a wilting calla lily, Wanxin's mother's smile had faded away and those frown lines that sat between her once well-groomed eyebrows ate into her skin so that they hardened her appearance further.   Then, Wanxin's teacher introduced her cousin to Mother. A widower with a son. That would be Wanxin's fourth brother... her step-brother... Zhongmin. He was plump and prosperous unlike them. The 2 years of poverty had made her and her brothers pallid and scrawny. "Lalangs" - Ah Ma had called us - after the feathery-white topped weeds that swayed in the breeze downstairs. Bending in the wind, lost and unwanted. Ah Ma hadn't like them at first. But as she grew ancient, she found solace in them where she found only frost from her own son and his son.   There was a fuss-free wedding between Wanxin's mother, Wanling, and Old Mah as his friends called him. Just 2 witnesses, an old wedding dress and an old wedding suit and cheap yellow gold rings from the jeweller downstairs. 2 lonely people and one lonely ceremony.  "Wanxin! Must I invite you again?"  Wanxin tied her hair up hurriedly.  "Ya. Ya. Coming!"  =================================================================== Copyright reserved by Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004)

						   The Sun set- fiery upon the golden sky; Another day had passed. Another day of fruitless waiting.  She tucked her hair behind her ears and swallowed back the tears that threatened to engulf her.  She took out the letter that she had folded and unfolded so many times, it was falling apart, and read it again.  He never made promises lightly and she knew that he'd make it back.

      Hi Dear, I've finally responded to your blog...  Sorry it took so long to do.  I was listening to the CD you burnt for me, and I found so many of the songs I had on my com previously (before it died), or songs I was listening to when I was morose previously.  Things like  Hazard , or  Heaven Knows .  And I have the Robbie Williams stuff too.  And even  Life in Mono  and  Love, Me .  Listening to Sarah Mclachlan now, singing  Angel .  It's such a strange coincidence, speaking of similar tastes, or something more.  And although I am not one for radical speculation, it's a nice feeling -- to be able to hold a CD that my Dearest burnt for me, that feels like I could've compiled it myself.  I love you, my fellow fan of "The Wedding Singer".  =)

      I dunno what was wrong with me last night but the tears kept pouring out as if a dam had burst or the floodgates had opened and I couldn't stop crying.   You've never and you haven't disappointed me dearest and I love you so much and I know you love me the same way too.  I guess... well... Somewhere behind my smiles lies a once-brokened heart and from time to time, when anyone (including myself) accidentally scrapes off the scabs before it heals completely, the wound tends to smart and bleed.  You've healed me a great deal but I guess some pain takes longer than others and I will take a while to get over my fears. I know you aren't Keith and that you WILL NEVER EVER hurt me... but it's hard not to fear because he was once nice to me and then I dunno what happened and he became the man I left... Is it me? Do I turn people into monsters? I guess that thought makes me scared that I might one day unknowingly annoy you to the max and not know it... and bam! And I sit on the edge of my seat worrying because I am afraid of upsetting, annoying or frustrating you because I love you. Being with Keith has made me apologetic and it is sadly so hard a habit to break.   And sometimes it is hard for me because I really don't want to drift anymore. I don't want to be lost anymore. I want to belong and I want to belong to you. I have faith in you and I will wait but it is so hard for me because the geri side is okay but the mummy geri side needs something more because of Kae. But both of us won't force you to do what you don't wanna.  Aiya... annoyed with myself *tiaks her cheek*  Waiting for you to come over after church... love you dearest

      Your voice  On the phone Past midnight Caressing me Like the  Night breeze We held each other With syllables and Concise sentences No unnecessary words And the rhythm Of our breathing Echoing the  Beating of Our hearts Closing my eyes You take my  Breath away Closing my eyes You take me To places Far and distant From where I am Where I've been And we soar Above the cares Of our Mortal hearts To reach an Ephemeral Nirvana Before we fall Gracefully and Thankfully Into Each Other's "Arms" Two hearts One beat Two souls One breath  - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin

      I wish I could tell X sorry but I dun think he will give me that chance to. We were very good friends too but it wouldn't have worked out. An instinct thing. And more importantly, I looked away and I saw THE Someone that I could love wholeheartedly, who swept me off my feet and whom I am more than able to visualise the future with.  I know I have been rushing you a bit dear with my biological clock thing but you know I'll wait.   And I promise I will watch my tongue. Everytime I think of it, I will recall instead, the song "OH YES WYOMING" or any other snazzy funny tunes.  I love you very much Ian... dun let my being so annoying change anything...^^"

      All my life, I've eaten chicken and nothing's happened to me.  But yesterday, the souls of countless chickens I've ate before cried out for my blood.  Ok ok enough of the dramatics.  Yesterday, I choked on a chicken bone and had to go to the A&E where they almost plucked my tongue out, stuffed my nostrils sore and finally got it out.  Tell more later. My son has summoned me.

      I sit here and I recall The days of insanity So long before The darkness that drowned  This very soul That tore it apart That ate it whole Yet you were there Through my tears You crossed the  Metaphorical desert To slay my fears You made the Sun Shine on me again You cleared the clouds You stopped the rain Remembering the pain I love you more Never to be lost Ever again  - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004)

           Dearest remember these poems we traded?   December 05 2003   It keeps pouring out from nowhere...  The lines were never  Parallel  You said  They'd meet at a point  And i dare to hope  And I can breathe  Once again  I hope we never diverge  After we converge  i like the angle that  You and i are  Lying in right now -  Each others arms  And i would just  fall from grace  If the computer  Reboots  Right about now  You are the  Eye of the Storm  Where the calm is  Whilst everything  Everyone else  Whirls and roars  In a deafening  All consuming  Madness  Around and about  Me  Redeem me  With those  soft sad eyes  and those lips  and more  much much more  importantly  redeem me with  your gentle and  faithful heart  i await thee   Posted by Lachrymose at 1 : 57 am       I never wanted my fear to eat into you...  Fear is the cancer that eats away at my soul And doubt is his cousin Nibbling on the corners of my mind And so oft I forget to let go of the reins of my mind And leave it all to God Let the palpatations of my heart give direction To this directionless life My prose may lack the elegance of your hands But I am a popper in the realm of the real And I only have a foothold in the realm of dreams But my dream is what I offer to you Without compromise Without restraint So that you may blow your fairy dust upon it And make it bear fruit My love do not let me go into the darkness any more For I did not mean for you to stare at it for so long It was the darkness of my soul Of my own stupid self-doubt The gnawing, gnashing voices That scream at me in the day and in the night Telling me to descend into the dark Telling me to know my place And fall into line But I will not listen It is not my destiny And I know this now Because you are here And you are the proof That my life's journey Was destined for purer things From the first.  I have tread this path so carefully For so long That I have forgotten what it is To leave it to God I let the disappointments weigh me down When I should have let them soar And when I first discovered you I should have sprung free And leapt into the sky And now Even as I try to steady my trembling hands All I can offer is my heart It is the only thing of value I own But it is yours If you would only grasp it tight in your hands Because I never want to let you go.  This is my moment This is my chance It took me so long to find you I have been searching my whole life for my other half The piece I've felt missing my whole life And when she finally appeared I could not believe my eyes And I ducked my eyes And mumbled my hellos  But no more Because this is the moment And I'm going to take care of you all my life Because if I lose you now I am lost forever.  I love you so much, Geraldine Tan; Please never leave me. God, please forgive me.  Please love me.   Posted by the idiot at 12 : 06 pm on 12 . 05 . 03

      For the enlightened few, that's from the "I'm so pretty song" LOL. Had a bad start to my day but it became good once my dearest came by to pick me up. Thanks dear... I know that was a ten-er gone for my sake again. Sighs.  We headed out for lunch with his folks which was great! We went to Samy's at Demsy road for lunch... Indian Curry thing. It was really yummy. That was a mean Fish head curry because the fish head meat was so tender and sweet. It was his bro-in-law's birthday u see. So we were all chatting and bantering and when we got to the topic of DOM, I very accidentally uttered the horrible sentence- " I was breastfeeding then."  I didnt realise what monstrosity my careless mouth had uttered until I saw Ian's wtf look lol... slackjawed, amused yet horrified all rolled into one.  Lucky for us, Uncle hurt his ears during NS so the ringing in his ears saved me from being caught red mouthed (not red handed) giving myself away.  Phew... the brief silence after was scary but it must have been my imagination abt how bad it was since Ian said it was very short and no one noticed/heard me say it...   I still think they did.  Stupid girl... sighs.  Sometimes it is hard playing pretend because u tend to let slip sometimes. Itz like acting cept itz more like stage acting (actual performance)... u cant slip up and if u do u gotta make it not seem so.   U have one chance with the folks and you gotta do good and you gotta not fuck it up.  U must live and breathe your character...  It really was nerve wrecking.  BTW love, I didnt dare to eat the Tandoori Chicken becoz i had such difficulties cutting the meat lol  Lucky we watched Shrek2 and it lightened my mood up... And Gelare waffles are so gooooooooooooooooooooood (so is their chicken chop thingee)... And all those shots of naked Achilles.... droooooooooooool. But ian is way way tons more drooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolable... muacks dear (sorry everyone else about ur goosepimples and nausea)  But dear when did the stunt double Achilles' heel appear???  Guess it was so good till I didnt notice...  Dearest thanks tons for the cordless phone and the cheapo one... and the sandals...  U wonderful man... Kev from Film Unit says he must learn from u hahaha... U set the bar higher with each new day.  Marriage isnt a one day commitment, it is a lifetime one and U know what? I fall in love with you everyday and wake up loving u more and more. My love has no maximum cut off point. It just goes on and on and on... I am porbably more committed to you than you'll ever know. sighs.  Ok gotta go... love u dear...  call/sms u later...  BS

      Heigho one and all... we've moved. At last. After an all-nighter packing session which saw my very very exhausted ian falling asleep in a foetal position on the floor after i myself conked out from feeding Kae. Luckily, I woke up at 4.50a.m. and resumed packing hahahaha.  Managed to get the essentials ready. Think I had the most number of cartons for my personals. lol.  The best part of the whole compulsory spring cleaning was that I found a total of around $160 that I had stashed away in bags and pockets and unopened CNY angbaos! I once was broke but now I'm "found"!  The new place takes getting used to. Whilst dining together, Ian and I felt as if we were at the chalets at East Coast or something. It was probably the scent of BBQ food wafting in the air (our patio faces the BBQ pits), plus the kindof- rustic landscape (well one glorified drain-river and a nature reserve across from us) and the sight of aeroplanes taking off and landing in the sky.  I guess I'm still not used to living in a condo... hahaha. Itz all nice and funny at the same time. As if I were on a long trip away from home aka TPY.   Oh well... once we've settled in, I'm sure it'll be ok ^.^  For now sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep... need it... all of us do... moving house sure is one mad experience...

      There was a time When Macs were superb And the PCs sucked  There was a time It all went wrong...  I dreamed a dream in days gone by When Macs were cooler than the PCs In my mind I thought that they were fine That they were worth the price we're paying  Then I was young and unafraid And I thought that Macs were funky I thought that PCs were a waste You'd buy Macs if you've got taste  But the Mac won't start each time I have got to keep restarting And the Mac it wastes my time Oh my dream has turned to shame...  Now I'd sell this Mac away But it belongs to my company I'd throw it far away But the damn thing lives another day  This Mac doesn't deserve to live This air-conditioned life that it is living Oh how different it is from what it seems The Mac has killed the dream I dreamt  - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004)

      My dearest... some days I sit here and think... and I figured out itz like NAPTFA... God prob wants to me to like go through every obstacle and train like shite for it before I get the gold medal aka you.  Sometimes it feels surreal that you're here. That we found each other when we stepped away from the closed doors and bumped back to back with the other, turned round, found that wonderful magic going between us and began this wonderful dance with each other- which I hope will last for as long as we both shall live.  We've only just begun to tango so I apologise if I've been rushing the whole wedding waltz thing... I guess it is this girl thing. Hahaha...like my future cuzin-in-law Jullie.  We always seek the security and that sense of companionship and belonging. Maybe even more so with me as I have so much more to lose, so much more to make up for and so much more to protect. I've fallen and hurt myself so badly and I never want to find myself in that living Hell again.  I know you want to take time to smell the roses and plan which is good... great. Of course we must leave it up to God but it's just that he can't take action for you- only you can... so you know at least 2-3 years before you want to go on that lifelong journey of love and commitment and claim your 7D/7N ^^" pleasee let me know. There is so much planning- like finance & budgeting for the life ahead, housing (dad really is thinking of letting me have the TPY flat so that will help i think),insurance, telling the folks eventually, planning for the big day, going for marriage preparation courses, preparing Kaelen, explaining to him (the older he gets, the harder to explain I think? It's like you know you don't remember much of your 4-5 year old days but when you hit primary school, you don't forget stuff that happens from then?) and letting your folks get comfy with him (again harder the older he gets... kids form closer attachments from a younger age I feel.)  I also dun wan Kae to go to school and be teased about being a bastard... something which haunts a close friend of mine who was also born out of wedlock... kids are not dumb... they can be fucking cruel. I remember vividly the way I got bullied in school and I never want my son to be hurt by that kind of shit. I am not trying to be over-protective but my kid doesn't have to pay for my sins. Itz not his to bear- it is mine and only mine.   Then again, you don't deserve to be rushed and to bear my sin for me too. I dun wan to scare u away and neither do I want you to regret any decisions you make about us.   I love you dearly and I'd rather wait than to ever make you unhappy about such an important event in our lives.  I guess maybe you still need to take you time to think... But I know (probably like how Derrick's wife knew about Derrick) that I want to spend my lifetime loving you and standing by your side no matter if it is good or bad times that lie ahead... I'd rather be rich in spirit and in joy than in material stuff... so none of that poor man shite k? I'd rather walk the hard road with you as enduring those hardship will forge a stronger bond. It doesn't matter to me whether my wedding is a lavish affair or just simple & sweet... it is a bonus... but what matters more to me is being able to finally be able to wake up beside you, to spend my life with you as one.  That's what memories are made up of... the little things... and someday when we hit our 25th anniversary, we can do that whole saying the vows again and walking down the aisle thing again with each other. My mum's godma did that and my mum said it was the most romantic thing ever. Their kids arranged it for their mum and surprised her. It was like a second wedding dinner thing... friends and relatives... wedding gown/ evening gowns... dinner in a hotel ala wedding dinner style... and a multimedia presentation by her kids about their parents and their love story. I hope we get to celebrate ours that way too... Apparently, they didnt have a big wedding when they got married becuz of money matters so this was a wonderful wonderful way of making up for it.   Anyway I should shuddup by now lol... longwinded and silly woman... I just wanted you to know:  I love you and I KNOW that IT is you and you're the only IT I need on this mortal coil.  Your silly BS

      It feels so natural To lie in your arms To strip bare my soul And bask in your Sun The rain can fall Upon me now But I won't fear at all Because you're around You'll shelter me - This I know - From the storms And hold me close - in those arms -  When things go wrong You give me no cause To doubt in your love You bring me greatest joy You bring me greatest mirth And I'll stand here beside you Through the bad and the good If you will let me Share your joy and your tears Your pain and your fears Your dreams are mine Your nightmares too I want to be there No matter the price Nothing's too great To sacrifice If there is us There's nought I won't do To paint you a rainbow To make your skies blue Just hold my hands And hold it true Just hold my heart For I love you  Never let go No matter what tomorrow holds...   - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004)

      Dear dear dear u read this article and U know why I've put it on... hahahahahaha. Love ya.  "Vanessa Marcil, from NBC's new hit drama, "Las Vegas," came on. She immediately told Ellen that Ellen's a huge star in her household 'coz she has a 2-year-old, and of 'coz, "Finding Nemo," and which kid doesn't adore "Dory", eh?! Yeah, Vanessa has seen "Finding Nemo" 38 times with her kid already, so far!!! Ellen kept apologizing to her about that!! It was funny, the way Ellen felt bad about Vanessa having to watch the movie so many times with her kid! But Vanessa was raving about how funny Ellen was, playing "Dory" so watching the movie over and over again wasn't such a bad idea!"  I LOVE DORY and I think I've watched it more than 38 times with Kaelen! I've watched Nemo so many times I've lost count. At the worse stage it was like 4 times odd a day so I watched it like close to 28 times a week. And this went on for months! So that was like 28x 4 x2 =224 and still some more actually... times when we watched only disc 2 becoz Kae would cry watching disc 1 whenever we're at the part Nemo gets caught.  Sighs...I oughta get the DVD coz my VCD was hopping and skipping like a B.boy (ie a breakdancer).   I LOVE DORY... oh did I say that already? Hahahaha. I think DORY made the movie really funny and without Dory it wouldn't be half as good...  P/S Oh ya here's pix of Ellen Degenere and her other half, Alex. http://www.geocities.com/webmaster_edg/epix_ea.htm

And there is the beauty of taking our sweet time instead of bonking within 2 weeks of meeting like some people do... as you can see in the above song... the chorus spells out all i want to say...  Wish I met you first... but I am sure that whole Vanishing Point theory had its reasons and I am glad the distance keeping us apart for so long has vanished... I love you my beloved IT...

      Silently it stalked And ravaged A fragile heart At its most susceptible moment In the dark Door to the soul closed I could not open them I could not escape from The images I saw Yet cannot see Playing like a movie  In my mind A tragic minuet Where we both played Parts we could not choose In that fearscape And when the tune Was played And the musicbox Was shut The curtains parted And I was staring At the play of  Light and shadows Upon my ceiling The pillow dampened By sweat mixed with bitter tears As the crows called And the dawn began to break Upon a brand new Mourning...  - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004)

      I will miss my TPY flat.  11 years confined within these walls that are now a badly painted 3/4 baby blue and mostly yellowish rose white and pink/blue wadrobe...gonna miss the view of the carpark (i know watz so good abt it rite? i think the lighting there's so romantic and pweety on rainy days... ok that and also bcoz horny ppl made out in cars on the topmost openair floor...grins) plus my FAVORITE last-wadrobe-door-opens-to-storeroom trick...  I guess moving to R.V is opening a new chapter in my life.   As the Chinese wisely put it :Old one don't go, new one don't come.  Letting go of this place for now is like letting go of memories that hurt. (U see...Kae's dad used to put up in my room when we were together after Kae. There have been good and bad memories but regardless, they inflict pain when I remember...)  Embracing R.V is like firmly grasping hold of ian's hands and leaving the pain far behind me.   OK...OK this one I will explain:  In a strange twist of fate, my ian happens to be moving to another RV in Sengkang (how cool is that! i just realise the initials of ur's and mine = RV!) which is like all of 5 bus stops away from my new pad. And cooler still is that we are moving one week apart of each other. He moved last weekend and i am moving this weekend. we are also similarly too busy with work to pack and so nagged by our parents to do so. MUACKS. Same boat alrite.  So itz like indirectly-sort-of-migrating from one province to another with him-who-loves-me-and-my-son.   Hmmm maybe province is an exaggeration since Singapore is so tiny and kecit but the thing is it almost feels that way coz town aint 15 minutes away no more man... (yea that's the bad thing abt moving)  BUT the good thing outweighs the bad... really. I mean instead of being 15 mins away from town, i am 15 mins away from my dear... NOW that's as long as ian's parents decide that they'd rather stay there instead of Jurong... or else he'll have a harder time seeing me home and coming by to visit.   One thing I love about ian (oh i love everything abt him really ^^) is that he sees me home no matter how late, how far, how impossible... he still manages to. He only let me take a cab home alone ONCE and felt guilty about that... silly silly man... but yes i do ENJOY being seen to my doorstep... feel very very safe that way and very very honoured and extremely loved... guys reading this LEARN from him hahahaha...   I am so looking forward to seeing you jog by my patio and calling you up to buy things from RV Mall for me hahahahaha... my own "dial and deliver" service...jez kiddin' dar'...winks cheekily. It will be so nice to actually just take a bus and be home within minutes after seeing me home eh? Can't wait can't wait can't wait!  So much anticipation and excitement... i miss you my working-at-home-and-not-sleeping-yet-darling...  Your BS

      Damn. Style is mediacorp publishing's baby. Damn! Damn! Damn!  I was thinking - in case dun have my colour mebbe can get frm work place... will pay fer it of coz.  Thankfully i got the ones i want... maybe i should get the green one too.  Yes... les stupeed beeetch here has bought into the gimmick and grabbed 2 copies. Am now the proud owner of a blue/white and a black/white bikini. Now all I need is the green/salmon-brown one. I know itz a cheapo bikini but better cheapo bikin than no bikini. I can't afford the $500+ Prada ones you know. Well unless a generous soul is mad enough to get me one. PLEASE DUN... i'd rather have a simple silver ring or that Arwen necklace than that Prada bikini... winks.  AND...If you are Ian you didn't see that... You've given me too too much my love and all I need is YOU... Splurge on your new shoes and new pants etc...   AND if you are my mother even more so that you didn't see that bit up there and dun nag... (lol i really hope she doesn't read this ever... or else i am SO dead.)  I love bikinis. Stretchmarks or not, I will wear them with a vengeance... well maybe not. I will sort of wear them with a vengeance. For the private viewing of one bf and one son. I dunno. Someone I know has stretchmarks and a tan... somehow they dun go. Itz like milo and susu... the stretchmarks stood out pale against her otherwise bronze goddess skin.  ** CURSE YOU PREGNANCY STRETCHMARKS!**  Oh well... shall have to go for the pale as ghost image then since I can't do bronze goddess no more. Oh those days in Brighton... tanning almost nude on the hammock... Oh WAIT... EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW... images... strong images of 60-something years old host mum in a glitter purple bikini... not kidding btw... BUT she's helluva funky and she dances salsa and well what can I say- dates men 20-30 years younger than her... Still i dun think i'll be in a bikini when I am 60 m'love so heave a sigh of deep relief.

      doing something really smart when I asked you to be a part of my life. Altho' not exactly the final confirmation yet(... that one I will leave to you to decide when k? heehee ), but the last 6...well, almost 6 months have been a dream come true. True that there's still a long long way to go and I dunno wat will happen; but come what may, I will keep holding onto those strong hands.  I remember the first time we held hands... well everytime we've held hands, I've always felt loved and protected because you hold them so firmly.  Thanks for taking my sweaty palms into yours and I hope that you will never nevvvvvvvvvvvvvvver let them go.  Luv Your BS  (Read my personal info again... heehee)

      I always thought we would be forever Never thought it'd end  But then it did I held on till my hands bled Held on as my heart wept Till one day I tried to feel but I couldn't  Why have things took a turn down this lane Where we play out bitter roles in disdain Where have all the smiles and laugters gone away to Why can't we talk to one another like we used to do  There isn't any love left Isn't any joy left Isn't any spark left  Between us There used to be something there It used to burn so bright there Now there isn't any love anymore When we both walked away from it all  You changed from a nice man into a stranger And I smelled the danger But I stayed on And I know deep inside you You must have loved me But the longer I stayed the lesser I knew  Why have things took a turn down this lane Where we play out bitter roles in disdain Where have all the smiles and laugters gone away to Why can't we talk to one another like we used to  There isn't any love left Isn't any joy left Isn't any spark left  Between us There used to be something there It used to burn so bright there Now there isn't any love anymore When we both walked away from it all  - Copyright of Geraldine Tan Xiu-Yin (2004) =====================================================  Ian sorry it's not about us and you know it. I just  had to write this... I love you my dearest and I've moved on from my past but sometimes it still hurts and it's not your fault. I love you very much Ian. No doubts about that. Absolutely none.  Just don't ever hurt me like he did... but then again I know I dun even have to ask because you never will.  You are my blessing and my dear heart... someone I  treasure very very much.  Love always, Your BS

      Sleep deprivation can cause one's IQ to plummet quite a few points. It also affects one's mood and well... it affects my skin too.  Yet ironically, my skin got better when the main source of my sleep deprivation appeared-Kaelen. He is the real reason for my interrupted sleep since 2002. But I ain't complaining.  Anyone who knows me will know that my ambition now is to someday sleep 9 hours straight without waking up- Kinda like in the BK (not burger king but before kaelen) past. If I am a Li-ion battery, my battery fluid should be screwed up by now. Everyone knows that with Li-ion batteries you must max them out to zero and then charge from there till it's full and some more. Well... it kinds of explains my "battery life".   Here, I would like to apologise to my poor significant other who has to put up with a girlfriend who falls asleep over the phone suddenly. No, I don't have narcolepsy... my body was just so tired, it threw me into REM straight away. My cicadian pattern is officially kapoot.  I could be awake and all preppy one moment on the telephone and then the next thing silence... then deep breathing... a normal person would put the phone down... a person-in-love-with-geri will wait (thanks hunny) and i do spring to life again sometimes but he'd be asleep.... and being a person-in-love-with-ian, i can't bear to put the phone down. So about 85% of my phone bill is about silence- a deeper and more complex communication than chitterchattering.   What I really want to say is... Thank you dar' for being there even when my ear is plastered to the phone but my brain and mouth aren't there. My heart usually is and it's always touched by your love.

      About not knowing anything and yet still finding the courage to take the plunge. It is about choices. It is about finding laughter within the darkness. About dancing in the rain. It is about sacrifices. It is about challenging boundaries. It is about picking yourself up each time you fall. About breathing. About your heart beating. It is about movement. It is about being still. It is about rising... and falling. It is about celebrations. It is about acknowledgements. It is about emotions. It is a journey to find happiness. But most of all, life is about love.

      The other day I asked my significant other a question that had been bugging me for ages.  " Ian..."  " Yes dear..."  " What if I hadn't told you that I liked you? Would you have told me by now that you did too?"  " No. I don't believe in spoiling friendships."  Apparently, he had tried before on some other girls he had liked before & of course... failed.... So just when he thought that it was pointless to even hope or ask at all, I had asked him. God is not without a sense of humour.   My point is- If you live life wondering about the "What if"s, you might as well try to live it without regretting anything. I mean I'd rather wonder "What if I hadn't told ian about my feelings?" then "What if I had told ian about my feelings?" ... because believe you me... they take you down 2 totally different paths.  Life is about choices. You can't just sit on the fence.  You fancy your mate, you tell her. You want to study this instead of that, you tell the folks. You don't just sing "que sera sera what will be will be" and expect it all to be served right up to you. That is not being positive or optimistic or realistic... that's called FATALISM... Being fatalistic sometimes mean you don't get what you want or deserve. You get what people think you want or you deserve.  I'd rather steer my own ship than let someone else steer it for me. I'd rather charter my own course.  Of course, it is also God willing and all but the thing is you need to be active about choosing and doing stuff... you need to be vocal...  sure things are sometimes about luck and fate and all that BUT every thing in life revolves around CHOICE. You can choose to take or not take the gamble. You can choose to try for the top prize in the Sweeps or to pass on what's possibly the winning ticket because you don't want to give it a shot.  So stop whinning if you don't get that present you've always wanted or the girl you've always fancied if you didn't open your mouth.  Kate Winslet says it best in her song "What if" ... " If I'd stayed... If you'd tried ...If we could only turn back time...  But I guess we'll never know  ."  In choosing to be with ian, i chose to forgo other paths/choices... i was proactive in choosing and taking that jump...  and i am glad i did. I won't know what happened if I hadn't but I am glad that I am not regretting that I hadn't keep quiet because we all know his answer to that question. Grins.  BS   *Love you dearest...*

       15052004::1302hrs   I haven't eaten my breakfast and I now understand what they mean by it being the most important meal of the day. My IQ feels as if it has plummeted and soon, all that I can think of is - I NEED FOOD.  Hunger is a raw feeling of need and want. It stops you from being picky. Everything smells good, tastes good. As long as it fills you up and takes away that emptiness inside.  I can't ever be anorexic because i love food too much but i can't be obese because i am too vain. Hence, I sit on the fence- a healthy weight and a cuddley size that can still allow my dear to encircle my waist with his arms.  I can't write anymore until I have something to crunch on, munch on, sip and slurp on... for all i can think of is how i need to eat... and once i am filled up, i will feel the emptiness of missing my dearest.

      You know how it is when you do something wrong...  You feel awful and you wish you could die for it But you cant And then they say they forgive you But you know you'll always lose their trust And even if it is a little And even it is a small push that they give for you to back away It cuts and it hurts Because you know it is your fault That nothing can ever be the same That the table's been reversed... And you're the one begging But nothing will ever be the same in some ways And you had a part to play in it And itz not their fault Ever because it is completely totally utterly your fault stupid bitch stupid bitch stupid bitch

      Havent been writing up here. Lazy bitch.  Anyway many things happened. Stuff that are better forgotten. As the saying goes- Let sleeping dogs lie.  Have been visiting the red sea twice a month for 2 mths now... almost like a while back. Worrying but was told that itz normal. It'd better be.  Kae's very funny of late.  He watched the Gatsby ad wit hthe enthusiastic man singing about styling one's hair and commented (at the end when he becomes an old man and then a skeleton) that "Never eat rice become like that."  LOL  Then, today was bathing him (and he insisted on stripping his own clothes off) when I used the a different shampoo from the one he wanted to use... and he said "Mummy use wrong shampoo for you. Must wash with this one only. Boy boy's hair delicate." And then he proceeded to re-wash his hair with THE shampoo he wanted. (shakes head in disbelief at her fussy 2 year old)  He also enjoys playing with his fake laptop when I am doing work at the com and proclaiming "Mummy work. Boy boy work also! Boy boy grow up work channel i (or channel U or when he wants to "suan" me, he says channel 5 or 8! he can tell btw the competition!!!)  I love Kae so much... just hope I can be a better mum wif each new day... cant imagine life w.o my little boy wonder.

      The first time I came across this book was when Mirja Kramer, my German schoolmate, gave it to me one day telling me that it was a book I would appreciate.  And she was right.  In fact  "The Prophet" is a book many can appreciate. The words strike true and resound with wisdom.  The last few entries were excerpts taken from that book.  It's worth reading and worth contemplating.  My only regret is that I dun have that bk anymore... but u can find it online and also in bookstores.  Food for the soul trapped in a web of busy-ness and forgetfulness...

      You pray in your distress and in your need; would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance.   For what is prayer but the expansion of yourself into the living ether?   And if it is for your comfort to pour your darkness into space, it is also for your delight to pour forth the dawning of your heart.   And if you cannot but weep when your soul summons you to prayer, she should spur you again and yet again, though weeping, until you shall come laughing.   When you pray you rise to meet in the air those who are praying at that very hour, and whom save in prayer you may not meet.   Therefore let your visit to that temple invisible be for naught but ecstasy and sweet communion.   For if you should enter the temple for no other purpose than asking you shall not receive.   And if you should enter into it to humble yourself you shall not be lifted:   Or even if you should enter into it to beg for the good of others you shall not be heard.   It is enough that you enter the temple invisible.   I cannot teach you how to pray in words.   God listens not to your words save when He Himself utters them through your lips.   And I cannot teach you the prayer of the seas and the forests and the mountains.   But you who are born of the mountains and the forests and the seas can find their prayer in your heart,   And if you but listen in the stillness of the night you shall hear them saying in silence,   "Our God, who art our winged self, it is thy will in us that willeth.   It is thy desire in us that desireth.   It is thy urge in us that would turn our nights, which are thine, into days which are thine also.   We cannot ask thee for aught, for thou knowest our needs before they are born in us:   Thou art our need; and in giving us more of thyself thou givest us all."

      You would measure time the measureless and the immeasurable.   You would adjust your conduct and even direct the course of your spirit according to hours and seasons.   Of time you would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.   Yet the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness,   And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.   And that that which sings and contemplates in you is still dwelling within the bounds of that first moment which scattered the stars into space.   Who among you does not feel that his power to love is boundless?   And yet who does not feel that very love, though boundless, encompassed within the centre of his being, and moving not form love thought to love thought, nor from love deeds to other love deeds?   And is not time even as love is, undivided and paceless?   But if in you thought you must measure time into seasons, let each season encircle all the other seasons,   And let today embrace the past with remembrance and the future with longing.

      Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.   Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.   And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;   And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.   And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.   Much of your pain is self-chosen.   It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.   Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:   For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,   And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.

      Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.   And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.   And how else can it be?   The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.   Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?   And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?   When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.   When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.   Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."   But I say unto you, they are inseparable.   Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.   Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.   Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.   When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

      Then said a rich man, "Speak to us of Giving."   And he answered:   You give but little when you give of your possessions.   It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.   For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?   And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?   And what is fear of need but need itself?   Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?   There are those who give little of the much which they have - and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.   And there are those who have little and give it all.   These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.   There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.   And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.   And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;   They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.   Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.   It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;   And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving   And is there aught you would withhold?   All you have shall some day be given;   Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.   You often say, "I would give, but only to the deserving."   The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.   They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.   Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.   And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.   And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?   And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?   See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.   For in truth it is life that gives unto life - while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.   And you receivers - and you are all receivers - assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.   Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;   For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father.

      And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."   And he said:   Your children are not your children.   They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.   They come through you but not from you,   And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.   You may give them your love but not your thoughts.   For they have their own thoughts.   You may house their bodies but not their souls,   For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.   You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.   For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.   You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.   The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.   Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;   For even as he loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

      You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.   You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.   Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.   But let there be spaces in your togetherness,   And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.   Love one another but make not a bond of love:   Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.   Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.   Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.   Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,   Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.   Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.   For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.   And stand together, yet not too near together:   For the pillars of the temple stand apart,   And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.

      When love beckons to you follow him,   Though his ways are hard and steep.   And when his wings enfold you yield to him,   Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.   And when he speaks to you believe in him,   Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.   For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.   Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,   So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.   Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.   He threshes you to make you naked.   He sifts you to free you from your husks.   He grinds you to whiteness.   He kneads you until you are pliant;   And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.   All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.   But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,   Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,   Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.   Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.   Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;   For love is sufficient unto love.   When you love you should not say, "God is in my heart," but rather, I am in the heart of God."   And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.   Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.   But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:   To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.   To know the pain of too much tenderness.   To be wounded by your own understanding of love;   And to bleed willingly and joyfully.   To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;   To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;   To return home at eventide with gratitude;   And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

      Jsut had an argument with Mum.  Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. We're arguing about the money thing between Aunty Ida and her again. How hard is it for her to draw the money out and return to them?  She insists that I am asking her to scold them and that I dun wanna be friends with Keith. She is upset that I only let Keith see him once in three weeks instead of once a fortnight.  Firstly, I just want her to tell them politely that now that I am working, we can handle the financial aspect already. Secondly, I do talk to Keith and I am not rude or mean to him. And she say she cant change her account because it is her Giro account yada yada yada but then how hard is it to draw the cash out to return?  She is obviously making excuses.  And why isn't she on my side regarding visitation? And he is my child and her grandson... does she rather all the transitions for him to be harder? This way it is easier for everybody to move on...  Someday Keith will move on and have his own family & so will I and Kae...  I am just so tired... think I will change my clothes and go to church even if I am late... I need the Lord's solace and wisdom.  BS

      This line will explain WHY:    Love loves unconditionally. Love loves even if hated and crucified in return.

      I just don't understand why my mother insists everybody does it her way. I got a laundry basket for my room so that I can put dirty clothes inside for washing but of course, she has to go and put my clothes that I want to wear one more time (to save her hands becoz she refuses to use a washing machine and her rubs her hands raw) in there and insist I put it at God only knows where for her to wash because there ISNT a laundry basket at the washing machine for dirty clothes. That's for her hangers and clean clothes that's just been laundered and swimming floats and brick brats...  I mean I am trying to keep neat and she just eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerks!  Just fergeddit... not going to save her hands anymore just going to wash and put inside.  She wun even let me do my own laundry and wants it done her way with her soap powder (that causes a rash on mine so I got a different brand and got scolded for that)... itz like that with everything.  Even if I sweep the floor, it has to be done her way!  Sighs....  Think think think....  Ok the simplest solution is to have TWO baskets. One for dirty clothes and one for wearing again ones... if she still makes noise, I gif up  BS

      I was listening to the wma files on my Muvo and when it got to this one, I felt so touched. It's a lovely song by John Denver. The CD version I had was sung by a lady and the CD was The Best of Audiophile.  What hit me were the thoughts in brackets as I listened to it:  Perhaps love is like a resting place  A shelter from the storm (Finding Ian was a respite from the choppy waters my life's been) It exists to give you comfort It is there to keep you warm (Ditto... thought of the times Ian's been there when I was suicidal, sad, cold, depressed,...) And in those times of trouble When you are most alone The memory of love will bring you home (whenever i am down, i think of ian and he brings me home... like Dory told Marlin " When I'm around you...It's like I'm home.")  Perhaps love is like a window Perhaps an open door (ian and i both turned away from "closed doors/windows" to find each other. As the saying goes- When God closes a door, he opens the window) It invites you to come closer It wants to show you more (Will you let me do that my dearest?) And even if you lose yourself And don`t know what to do The memory of love will see you through (Nods nods... I hope Ian feels the same)  Love to some is like a cloud (I used to believe in it being ephemeral) To some as strong as steel (Not any more) For some a way of living  For some a way to feel (I live and I feel loved and I give my love... I hope it is enough compared to the abundant love you give me dar') And some say love is holding on  And some say letting go (how true...) And some say love is everything (you are so important to me dearest... u dunno how.) And some say they don`t know  Perhaps love is like the ocean Full of conflict, full of pain (oh yea there will be bad days right? but we'll pull through) Like a fire when it`s cold outside (yea you keep me safe and warm... seeing me home the way you do.) Or thunder when it rains  If I should live forever And all my dreams come true (most of them have the day i found you) My memories of love will be of you (always)  And some say love is holding on And some say letting go And some say love is everything And some say they don`t know  Perhaps love is like the mountains Full of conflict, full of change Like a fire when it`s cold outside Or thunder when it rains If I should live forever And all my dreams come true My memories of love will be of you   Words and music by John Denver

      Kinda like farked up today very majorly... so really dooooooown...  Dunno how I can make mistakes with something so simple...  Even if no one said anything, I'd be very angry with myself... as those who are really close to me will know...  Didn't cry for pity... I never will.  I cried because I was so angry with myself...  if they feel disappointed, I feel two-three times worse  Sighs... stupid bitch ie me.  BS

      If working here in Media____ has taught me anything, that is to further appreciate each and every person and the role they play in making sure a programme appears on telly.  Most people have this mistaken conception that "WAH! U work in TV Production! Must be very glam! Vey high pay wan!"  Ummm... sorry folks to break that misconception...  The pay is not really that high lah... really...  2) Where got glam???? Long hours, plus not very high pay (wan high pay go be doctor/lawyer lor), plus dark eye rings, plus tired...   3) Canteen food sucks (hahahaha... they call it Recreation Centre and itz dubbed Ritz Carlton by the staff)  Every programme goes through so many hands, so many processes before it gets to you... even the TRAILERS... I tell U ah it takes a long time to conceptualise, create and perfect... and then there are the trailer producers, the people who do graphics, the people who key in the damn trailers into the coms, the schedulers, the transmission people etc etc... so next time the ads come on, try to watch them lah... Otherwise hor our titles must change liao...  Possible new titles to address us by:  1) Toilet Break producer 2) Surfing Channel Time producer 3) Go Make Milo Time producer 4) Etc etc etc  Whilst working, you sometimes wonder who the **** notices the ads...  I remember my Mum's first reaction when I told her my graphics being used on ads on telly...  BS: "Mummy... my graphics on telly!" MUM: "Is it?" (stops doing housework) BS: "Ya for the Trailer of XXXX." MUM: Which Channel? BS: Channel X. MUM: (to my DAD) "Change to Channel X... ah ger's graphics on tv ah!" DAD: "Issit?" (changes channel quickly) MUM: (excitedly) "What time show on tv?" (prepares to dash to the tv) BS: "I dunno. It's an ad mah. It loops lor." DAD: Oh... like that ah. MUM: "Chey... advertisement. I thought what show." (resumes housework)  Sniffles... we are the under-appreciated artistes man. The forgotten. LOL. I tell you ah... without us hor... you where got trailers to watch?! So must support a bit lah. Next time got ad right, fight the urge to visit the loo or the kitchen or to fiddle with the remote control and watch our ads man...  Make us happy happy a bit mah...  Hor darling? Hor? Hor?  Hehe... BS

      We finally got our bus 112 route nailed last night... Ha ha!  SO we hadn't missed the damn stops we had not passed them at all.  As far as loop services go, 112 probably has the longest route siah!   You see a while back, Ian and I had decided to try taking a different bus back to my place from Kovan. Instead of 136, we took 112 which gets to the side gate.  What we didn't know was that we couldn't take 112 from across the road from Heartland Malls. 136 yes. 112 no.  112 had to be taken from the same side as Heartland malls.  I mean... unless you want a tour of Hougang.  And man... it's a long route.  Almost as long as from Chinatown to Kovan via the NEL. About 8-9 stops.  It was one hell of a "tour" but at least we found our way back this time.  No longer will we feel taunted by the 112s that pass us by when we walk from the side gate.  Hahaha... Persistence pays off after all.

      Hi Eversince I started REALLY keying in TVW, I havent had anytime to write blogs... hence all the handwritten notes my darling Ian's accumulated =) LOL  Well to cue everyone in on my life so far...  Life's been good. Ian and I are busy with work but busy being in love with each other... and Kae talks a great deal these days... ^.^  Oh yes about my Kae -  The other day, I brought him to my colleague's housewarming party which was also my department head's birthday. So what happened was that Kae was a good boy- shaking hands of everyone he saw and smiling. And then, my dept head and his family arrived. He has a daughter 2 mths older than Kae called Peppermint. Kae thrilled to see another kid, immediately went over to give her a hug and then tried to give her a kiss. Everyone keeled over from laughing and I hope my dept head too otherwise I prob won't get my perm status!!  Another funny incident happened when Peppermint who was sitted on her dad's lap across the room from Kae (who was perched on my lap) and myself. She wanted to look for her Mum who had gone to take something from the kitchen so she cried out "Mummy??" And my son looked at her and said in a very annoyed tone "Mummy here lah!" Everyone burst out laughing. I had to remind Kae that he had a different Mum from Peppermint. LOL.  Then, during the birthday singing part of the party, Kae smiled and looked bashful as everyone sang the birthday song and when they were done, he turned around wanting to blow the birthday cake! He thought it was his birthday too! =)   After we left the place and got a cab to head off home, Kae crashed the moment we left the vicinity as he had played so hard and it was past his nap time.
