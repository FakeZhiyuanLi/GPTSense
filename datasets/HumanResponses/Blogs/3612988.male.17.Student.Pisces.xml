      hey today is 4 months just after my birthday yeah! haha..nah lame. been so so tired these few days all due respect to all the muggings that i've done. esp biology. wa lau i study like siao lor. same still last night i slept at 0345. haix when will my sleepless nights end??? i'm like feeling dizzy every now and then lor. had a chat with alex last night. haha. he's in poly now liao wor and he was tellin me about his orientation. he said he can be a class rep already cos the people in his group not very active and he can be considered one of the most enthu one liao! haha yeah...all the best man!  school reopening liao...feel kind of scare and sianz...haven realli enjoyed myself yet. come to think of it, i'm quite missing the december holiday which was just after the O levels lor. it was so fun and relaxing. going to fren's house to play. going out walk walk watch movie. go trekking and cycling at P. Ubin. lots and lots...:D  thoughts of the day: this is what alex told me...he said the guys in mixed schools when talking to other guys, more superficial in speech, as compared to guys from boy school. because they lack the kind of brotherly bonds between them.  people from mix school are more untrusting and are always to  conscious of themselves that they appear to be very "fake" as in their expression of thoughts may not be exactly what they think lor. well there can be exceptions. by me!

      Prisoners of Azkaban  You cried you whined You weeped you repined You kept asking 'Where is the love'  Have you asked yourself Art thou fate controlled by mama Have you asked yourself 'To be or not to be'?  You said 'Victims of circumstances No freedom no choice no preference.' But who said so, who said so? Have you asked yourself Who gives the verdict so?  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.  Let's not forget all the dementors No matter how you escape at all cause Not that Common? That's all false  They suck all the happiness Making much of you so lifeless Exposing all your weakness Making much of you so brainless All this more or less Due to much of you so careless  So now you've got to memorise Sine sine cosine pie Three point one four one five nine  You said 'Victims of circumstances No freedom no choice no preference.' But who said so, who said so? Have you asked yourself Who gives the verdict so?  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.  Just let Lord be in your heart For He is the Alpha and the Omega For He will boost you spiritually For He will help you excessively For He is the one you'll lean on eventually  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.    Alex written it for me....nice rite...it's so cool...

      hey, i'm back here again...went to try out a speed typing game. haha. my personal record was 46 words per minute. arGH! the minimum speed that a professional typewriter should have is about 50words per min. oh man still lack by 4 words.haha!..well nvm...what's the big deal maN *bleah* Alex sent me a song, Life's a struggle, the other day and i find it really nice althou its a very sad song. It din sound really nice to me initially cos i think that its just too noisy for me. however after i've seen the lyrics. i'm really touched lor!  the song is written by this guy who is a bad teenager lor. he's got a broken family. his mother have to work till very late in the night and his father is always drunk. often he would would up in the middle of the night jus to hear his parents quarrel. He hated school and in the end gotten caught by the police for his crime. he written this song whilst in jail. it's about his life. how he has smoke till his lungs turn black, his girlfriend doing oral sex on another guy, and all sorts of rubbish that can happen to a gangster...(http://www.zheteng.com/ttt/lifeview.htm ) some time, i feel that we are too fortunate to be living in such a nice environment that we tend to forget that there are people out there who are left behind by the society to fend for themselves.....  yUP...going play soccer later ...jus behind my house...at 4pm!!

      haiya. school was kinda alright today. at least not as boring lor. i finally passed by NAPFA and got a silver! haha. actually nothing much lor. so stupid. i tried the SBJ for 6 times and finally made it, 222cm.&nbsp;then i went on to complete the rest of the stations.  after that me tim des jonchua kphang terence edz&nbsp; went home together.&nbsp;haha i'm so touched cos got tim jon desmond pei me go hougang mall to walk walk and buy concession pass. i was just making a comment asking who wants to pei me only. haha so gan dong. *smile* something terrible happen to tim today and i hope he can get through this thing smoothly. he has been a great friend and schoolmate. he had always been there for me. i know his character. he's definitely not what that HACKER said. FUCK off man, perhap that hacker should look at himself and reflect, cos i bet he aint any balls. damn. dont let me find out who he is.&nbsp; tim...stay cool....and take care.... oh ya. i really hope desmond and jonchua can go for the YEP. their absence would really mean alot to me cos i know the trip will be damn different without them. but jon chua said something which is true. he would not want to go for the appeal and look at those interviewers again. seriously if for me, i would not want to go thru that again.&nbsp; i think damon feels the same too.  hey man. i think the dragon-boating team ROCKS!

      cool man. i love catholic high. the school just rocks. the concert today wasnt that fantastic but it was the people who made it so sentimental and touching. saw lots of friends there like weijun, toad, tim, kp, weixuan, edz, dennis, hengqing, shizhen, and lots and lots...u guys just freaking rock! weijun brought this taiwanese guy from the imersion program to the concert. he was so quiet and sian lor. so turn off. cause he was kinda un-enthu. in the end weijun din really enjoy the concert. keith and his girl was doing *weird* stuff la! damn.  the concert was quite entertaining esp the choir one which was very creative. it's not like those traditional choir where they just stand and sing. instead the whole performance was actually a story. and they walk around, dance, action whilst singing. damn pro.  the atmosphere was very good. when we sang the peng you (friends)  and the school song. seriously i felt like crying cos all the memories just came back. lim tow wee. NDP days. Soccer. raping. joking. stripping. SEC 2-7.all sorts of rubbish we did together.  haha i din cry cause got girl girl beside me. how can throw face right?haha tim though cried. his face was really wet lor. i think the school really meant alot to him. to me. to everyone who graduated from year 2003.          catholic high....thank....
