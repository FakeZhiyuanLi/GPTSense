          well, It was just an other day! the routine..the alarm optimistically set at 5.30am, and as usual, me getting up at 7am. Crossing the over-head bridge and reaching the lab at 8.30am. Setup some experiments, Lunch around 12+, Coffee around 4, dinner around 9, back home by 11, TV till 1pm, and slee....snore...  Well it just an other day, isn't it?  How stupid and useless must I be to tell myself this before going to sleep.  Everyday is new, every experience is new, every second is different, then how can it be the same day? This was the question, I had to answer...  I started..5.30 I look out, Its not raining...It was raining yesterday..First change observed. I got ready, drank the Milo...well it tastes better today.. crossed the over-head bridge..as I was walking towards the lab, I heard a sound..stopped to look around, saw a beautiful white parakeet perched on the tree...the same tree that I have passed by for the last one year..how did I never see this Parakeet...changes, differences...hmmm, what has happened today... reached the lab...Sathish is wearing a new Jean, Zhong Ni has got a new bag, Aji has bought a new pair of sports shoes..and They recognize that I am wearing new clothes...hmm...differences..I realize that my experimental setup is better today, the design and protocols look effiecient.. Even my thought process seems organized.. The lunch tastes better, the environment seems good.. everything seems just nice...I am more genial in approach, not allowing any stress to get me worked up.. what is the difference..? I have stopped to observe..enjoy the nuances..I have stopped to appreciate the better things around me... After a long time, I have again stopped to acknowledge what life has given me..  I feel happy.. I feel content... I feel satisfied.... Well its not just another day, after all

      This is "my first" time in.. How many times would we keep saying this. My first day at school.. My first day at college.. My first date.. My first win.. My first loss.. and so on, If we look back, there has been so many "my first"s, and each claiming their due significance. "The first and last are never forgotten"..yes absolutely true.. on the same lines.. well..My first post at the blog.! Men may come, Men may go..but, ramblings stay on forever!!

           How long can the best be the best? till something/someone betters it/him/her..! How long can one hold the supremacy? till the one is singular..!  the power of superlative is definitely determined by time..the time taken for someone [let me stick to living things, specifically humans to avoid any parallax!]  the highest, the fastest and the longest [Yeah! Olympic fever..] are set only to be surpassed!  then why do the "temporary best" lose their feet to fly in the no space [not even thin air]? Of course, one has to enjoy his period of transient glory, but why don't they realize that it is only temporary?  "My only competition is..  Gravity - Sergei Bubka" He was "a best" [not  "the best"] before someone is going to take it away from him..well, it might take a long time though..then how can he be the Best..one of the best is a better arguement!  why does temporary glory get the better of a person's head? atleast Bubka had the accolades to claim his ground.. Why do some people bask in temporary superlatives!  Enjoyment is happiness! Realization is satisfaction. If you are satisfied, your happiness is enhanced! -- comprehend the above sentences in whatever way you want to..  Its quite surprising that though Superlatives are designated in the respective fields, the common leveller is always Time, at various spans though! [one more illustration of the significance of Time]  according to the Language and grammar, the better becomes the best in course of time...[the next level of better is supposed to best..and it is also emphasized that it is the end point, hence the term superlative]  well, what I see is "the best" in course of time becomes "the better"...the superlative eventually becomes comparitive...

      If Heaven is a planet, The resident of Heaven, God..is he an Alien?  This is something that has been in my thoughts for atleast 10 years. It was in my eigth standard when I saw the movie Predator starring Schwarzenegger [well it took me three years to get his spelling right]. If the predator comes from an other planet, something that is non-existent to the Human gamut of comprehension...why can't heaven be one such planet? and why not the celestial beings that we talk about be Aliens.. After seeing the movie Species... [well, I haven't seen it fully till now]..there can be members of the Human race who can carry alien DNA...and the so-called-saints and pious people...why can't they be carrying the Alien DNA and hence their superpowers... And analyzing Isaac Asimov, we are made to believe that Aliens are far more advanced than us..and why can't He be an alien, governing Planet Earth amongst a few thousand other planets and solar systems..???  My GOD, Do I sound like an atheist?...I am just coming back from temple..I am one highly spiritual being who trusts in GOD..God is so close to me..a friend, more than anything..and that makes me ridicule the comprehensions and definitions that we have for HIM.  As long as we FEAR God, and place him in the Heaven...We alienate Him..alienate ourselves from Him.  For me, and many others in the field of science... Science is the religion and Newton is the Messiah! He explains God much better than anyone else...  "Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion unless compelled by an external Force"...Well... This external force is GOD.. No ambiguity...!!!  Any comments? Anyone?
