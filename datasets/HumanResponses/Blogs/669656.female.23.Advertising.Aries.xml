      Gosh....i think this is my busiest day for the month of august. Seriously. I wake up to getsome clothes washed and then clear my room and cupboard and then i suddenly realize that we're leaving for Taiping tomorrow.....sheesh! So soon? And i thought the weekend was taking its time to draw near. So, basically its been getting all my stuffs ready, going to get bus tickets for the 3 of us leaving tomorrow and then planning my whole itinery for the next 2 weeks minimum in order to be in a stable condition.  So anyway, then i went to the temple to thank god for my results and do a special pooja and that took a bit of time. Then we had to go get a card at the mall for my uncle's birthday for which we're going up to taiping. He's turning 70. Gosh....would u believe that? It's not even the big five-o. It's like SEVENTY! Well i'll just reserve my sentiments to myself since i bet even he wouldn't be too happy about turning 70.  Anyway, today my blog is gonna be a bit the short since i have to get a few things done after this and my parents keep calling from the hall even though they don't quite need anything....ehehhe....parents will always be parents. When i'm in good mood, its nice to know that they miss me even though i'm a room away. When i'm in a bad mood, some of you have probably heard me complain my life story and how much of a pain in can be. For my mouth painful then to your ears i guess 10 times more painful huh? Awww....shucks....sowwy yeah? To those who have had to hear me unload some burdens.  I heard that my friend was sick today from another friend of course. Feel terrible i can't be there to see her. Maybe i can make it soon. We'll hope she ends up feeling a lot better. Take care of yourself and god bless you krystle. We'll be around for you no matter hoe long it takes.  Anywayz, it's good night for now. And my blog is gonna be idle for awhile since i'll be outta a computer again as long as i'm outta this house and that might even be for 2 weeks. If i manage to get access then i'll surely pen something k? Else i'll just have to update this site one shot when i get back. Good luck to me for Ericsson. And to the other xnetwork-ians, good luck as well yeah?

      Hmmm.....its weird.....i don't seem to get life sometimes. Whenu least expect it opportunities come knocking and then when you hope its like u've been hit by draught u know? And yet, i've seen very optimistic people who tell me to never give up and keep on hoping on life. The same 'life' that chooses to mock my beliefs and toy around with my emotions like i'm abroad a neverending roller coaster. Then someday, that ride stops and i'm told that when i reach that time, i will be free of everything and anything and here i'm thinking "What if i don't finish everything i want to do within that ride?" Do i then wanna be secure myself with a seatbelt and not get out from the roller coaster of all human beings called life? Such is what makes up our days and night and yet we still go on persistently wih no clue as to how life will end or what lies before us in our individual horizons.  Today, i woke up pretty early....about 9.30 a.m.....pretty early by my standards lately.....and then i got inspired to get online and check up on my jobstreet applications. The regular 1-2 matches with no offers and then i go on to mail. Now this is a luxury i gave up on for around 3 weeks due to trips up to KL and then a stroke of bad luck with my modem getting fried in JB. Then as i was printing out some stuff and updating my site and talking to this certain  urlLink  Papaya i know, i got called by Ericsson. Like WHAM! Ericsson?! And yes....i mean the huge reknowned telecommunications company. Even MY mind's still reeling. After weeks of printing and sticking and typing and posting, i get called by a company i didn't even apply for. So i go tell my parents about my pending interview and i see their eyes light up with hope. Argh! The deadly weapon of anticipated guilt i will be going through if i should not get through this interview. Immaterial of how much i know, whether i qualify or meet their demands. I got an interview and that's more than what they need to know.   So after informing them, i come back and get my first genuine smile for the day. A nice feeling creeps inside as i think of my pending interview and as fast as that joy starts to spread a feeling of dread creeps stealthily into my heart as well and i shake my head and tell myself not to hope. Should i take this as a sign? Hmm....maybe....and maybe not. So the best thing i do is to wait and just take the day as it comes. No hoping as it will only bring hurt in the end. As terrible as this is to some of you out there, it happens a lot. Probably not just to me, the oh-so-paranoid one....but also to others who care not to be optimistic. Why you ask? Well....lets just say its been getting me through a lot of rough spots throughout my 21 years of this life. And its like a jinx if i suddenly start just hoping and not worrying....ehehehe....weird but true! :) Want one of those air-hammers to knock my head and hear it go "Boing!".....? :)  Meanwhile, i can plan for other things that i'm more sure of like wat to eat, what to watch on tv, what to wear, when to play with my pets and simple everyday stuff like that. And you know that best part of all? I'm actually savouring the moments i do everyday things for myself because i know i'm not gonna be remaining in this cushion of comfort for long.  That's it i guess for today....nothing else has happened. Had lunch, watched a vcd and then lazed around most of today and will be online awhile more but i think i've thought myself out for today. Seeya later alligator!

Mmmm....brings back memories of my childhood. "The hills are alive!!!".....ehehehe.....so fun. Nothing else to do. Actually i got back from the theatre after watching 'Austin Powers - Goldmember' and then came back nothing much to do again so watching tv lar.....  Life's been very peaceful in Ipoh. I must say i've had a very relaxing time and am growing fat since its a good place to eat as well. I'll miss the routine. Hope i come back soon. Must get more reunions organized lar. :) Otherwise nothing much has been happening ere so not much to update. Will be getting offline now. I guess i'll sleep on the bus to KL tomorrow morning then. G'nite everyone...

      Well.....yesterday i was in Taiping and then last night came back to Ipoh and will be here in my uncle's place till Tuesday. Then its interview time on Wednesday and we'll have to see how it goes. I have to admit that the confidence is not there. Still....we'll see about that when i'm done with it. Now for my weekend.....  It was a tiring bus ride all the way from JB to Taiping. But i made it and although i didn't get much sleep it was great just the same because i got to catch up with the family tree. My mom's side family tree to be precise and it was good to see her (mom's) nuclear family back together again. Then you can just imagine the rest of the generations accumulated and expanded from the main family tree right up to some grandkids who are my nephews and nieces. Had a great time. Just didn't expect the bomb i was to face when i got back.  Food was a delight and ranged from wide variety's of mutton, dried chilly chicken (not kong poh kai), french beans, fried shredded shark, mutton cutlets, brinjal dish and finally caramel custard for desert. Yummy huh? You can just imagine my stomach's condition after lunch and my aunts are superb chefs. And that was not all! Along came tea time and we had fried curry puffs, pagoda (kacang kuda flour kinda cucur), taiping poh piah (tai chien poh piah), butter cake with icing sugar (my uncle's 70th birthday cake in the shape of the numbers 7 and 0 weighing 5 kg's) and rock buns. Mmmmm....mmmm......  Yup....all that food cannot be healthy and it's been awhile since i've pigged out to that limit so all in all it was excellent when i started and then not very good when we got back. It happened so that i wasn't the only one with an unfateful day. We all came back fine for the exception of one cousin who was sick and then we finally all took our turns getting stomach aches and then mild cases of diarrhoea. Shucks! the pains were as bad as colic pains and we had to all take pills and then just sleep the day away when we travelled back from Taiping to Ipoh.  I was supposed to come back today to KL with another cousin. Then all the others intefered and just told me to  put it off till the interview on Wednesday instead of sitting in my room in KL. Sounded good enuff to me since it's been awhile since i caught up with them too. So, basically i'm just pigging out, watching tv, chatting with cousins and reliving childhood memories with uncles, aunts and cousins. Pretty cool holiday i should say. Will be back in reality i guess when i step down in KL on Tuesday.  It's just this thing about Ipoh. Good food, life boils down to a slower pace and you just want to sit back, relax and enjoy that hot cup of white coffee. *Sigh*....I'm already gonna miss this. But can't wait to get to KL too. It's not good to start relaxing so early in life when i'm this young huh? :) Well....that's about the update for now. Will see if i can update my entry tomorrow. Until later....

      Tomorrow seems to be a different day from my normal routine. Earlier today i called up a friend of my sister's who seems to have his own company and needed a web designer. I figured i'd just see what i could do since i'm sitting around doing nothing anyway. Then to my amazement he says he will fetch me at 10 tomorrow to take me directly to alias with the client who's a shipping company. Sheesh! Talk about i'm not prepared for it but i guess i still rather do that than nothing at home. Otherwise my day's been pretty much the same. Finally got back my Pooja (russian dwarf hamster) back from granny's. Now just downloading some songs and clearing mail and applying for yet summore jobs. After this i think it will be an early night sleep so that i wake up tomorrow in time. Nothing much else today...tata.....

      I'm back online......well....the situation of my life? Hmm....i would say its "hanging on a thread". Yup....that would be a precise way to put it. It's quite terrible being in a situation like mine. Ours actually....and i'm talking about the rest of my college bunch of friends who call ourselves Xnetwork. Of course not all are like me. Some are pretty much settled if not for awhile then for a few years. As for me and the remaining others, life is slowly turning into a living nightmare. You wake up, brush your teeth, take breakfast, read papers and then realize that its yet again another boring day with nothing to do except go online, maybe update your blog, look for some more job opportunities, go out and watch some tv. Let's not forget eat, go out, sleep, eat, sleep....grow fat....ehehehe....and so on and so forth. The same routine......over & over & over & over & over & over & over & over & over & over again.  Tiring yes but not like i'm in a position to do much about it except to wait patiently until my mobile rings and some man or lady tells me i've been selected and am to attend an interview. JB.....i wouldn't quite mind working here just that i seem to be leaning a lot more towards KL. I mean there's the fact that i save on rent. Still, i just need to get a hold of my life, take control and be resposible for it. The way i see it...i can get all this better in KL or Penang. Anywhere away from the nest. Still....with the current job market, i guess i can't be too choosy now can i? :) So, its also applications for JB jobs from last month.  What have i been doing lately? Oh yeah there was that interview with Ericsson which seemed a little spark of hope and then got dashed. Still....it's just a stepping stone. Like swinging from one branch to another until you find the best tree with the best fruit. Hehehehe....gosh...now i'm getting all metaphoric. Maybe i should recommend this page to my future employers who ask me to tell them about myself. What say you? Otherwise, i've been in KL. Went to temple several times and then finally out of boredom started scrutinizing every page of the STAR newspaper until i got addicted to the crosswork puzzle. So, now i'm like diligently buying postcards (entry forms) to the contest from the post office, buying and reading STAR paper everyday and flipping through the dictionary more than i've done in the past 5 years. Guess these competitions were meant for ppl. like me huh? The whole 'inculcate proper reading habits especially of the STAR paper' marketing strategy seems to be working superbly with me. :P  Otherwise, i just got back to JB from KL for those who've been a bit lost on my life. Just got back day before. Been cleaning up a bit and unpacking. Tomorrow its bathe Bruno time...my darling labrador retriever that is. Then i guess i'll be back online before i know it. So until my fingers meet the keyboard......i'm gonna get some serious zzzzzzzzzzzzzz's in awhile....

      I'm alive!!!! Ok...so i'm exaggerating. But hey...it's my blog! I'm allowed....hehehe. This was my pre-written entry which i never had the time to update although i had it written on Monday.  DAY 1 ---------- "I am soooo tired as i have never been before and yet i made it on time to work after only arriving back at KL Sentral station at 4.00 in the morning. But i'm still perky because i haven't slept on anything flat and so the aches and pains haven't quite taken over just yet. Took the 5.30 lrt and got home in time to just bathe and then grab my bag and leave for work. Got here about 8 minutes late but my seniors walked in after me so it wasn't really a problem. They laughed when i look so harrased. Everybody seems to take it cool here....hmmm. So much for my tension!  Dabong was great!!! I did stuff there i have never done in my life. I climbed rocks next to a waterfall, i had to wade through knee length water and also travelled through a cave and had to use a chain to walk over some rocks. Dangerous?? Yes.....most definitely but that's why i wanted to go with this group. We had boys always in front and behind us looking out for our every step. The trek up was very tedious. We took it slow but it was steep and we had lotsa branches and tree roots we had to hold on to in order to get across. Very adventurous and gung ho kinda trip.  The waterfalls we were at was apparently the highest in Southeast Asia. It's located at a place called Gunung Ayam because the mountain it flows from apparently is shaped like a chicken's head. The water was excellent. Cool, clean and clear. We did the typical camping routine. The buidling fire, setting up the campsite, cooking food in mesh tins on a burner. We even managed to cook rice and stuff for dinner because we had more time. The other meals were mostly maggi and some sambal one girl Roopa's mom made. At that point, everything's just yummy. Especially everytime you take a dip in the water. You come out feeling like you haven't eaten in days. Water we consumed from the water fall itself. Boiled to make hot drinks but sometimes just like that as long as we caught it at flowing, strong current areas. There are lots of photos. 3 cameras and one digital camera. So, thanks to it we had more photos...some we didn't have to print. Still there's quite a large collection from the bunch of cameras.  Basically the trip was like this. We left KL station via train at 7.15 and arrived in Dabong 12 hours later at 7.30 in the morning. So we made lotsa noise and even got complained on making too much noise by some of the passengers. Then later we all settled down to sleep and conserve our energy for the trek. I came to the border of Johor in between....'coz the train had to stop at Gemas. Then we had a train shunting (train switches tracks by detaching and reattaching some coaches). So after arriving at Dabong station we walked through the quaint little kampung-type town towards a river with a rickety wooden jetty and one long boat that has a fan for a motor. There we took the boat across the river and then got into a van that led us to the base of the hills. There's a whole proper entrance all built before the jungles come into play so we got some tuna sandwiches and hot milo done and had them after a quick brushing of out teeth. Then, packed up and started out journey. The best part is that i never even climbed trees before but this time i actually climbed a lot with that heavy backpack on my shoulder summore and also managed to climb over rocks jjjuuusssttt beside the cascading falls. Felt good to be able to complete so many feats. Gave me hope as well that i'm not completely useless just because i'm asthmatic. Also i had 2 other asthmatics who came along with me. They're brother and sister. Quite funny. Both left their inhalers at home and figured the other one would bring it and had to get it at the pharmacy before boarding the train. Anyway, where was i? Yeah....so we did this steep, slippery and complicated climbed up a so call trail that wasn't even made properly for about 20 minutes with short and few breaks in between and came to a hanging bridge. That was a fork in the journey and the boys were insistent that we had to do it the hard way to really enjoy what we get at the end of it all. So instead of taking the bridge which would be to get across and continue trekking up with the same routine of monotonous trees, mangled branches and bushes, we took the left fork that was more challenging.  And boy was that a challenge! At this fork...we continued for about another 15 minutes up a steep climb and then came to the base of the waterfalls. Then we settled there for awhile, quenched our thirst and tested the waters just to refresh outselves and then climbed the rocks on foot and some places with hands as well. The waterfall started moving on to our left. We took a route juuuussstttt to the right of the falls and has to climb over rocks. Initially we'd see the boys climbing and then we'd think we could never do the same but they all take turns to guide us and pull us up even when necessary. In fact, they were more confident than we were about out ability and i think that gave us the motivation we needed. Very nice of them. Only one boy's mother came on this trip. Then after that, we climbed on up again through some paths and tangles of bushes and trees further and further up. This was already taking a toll on us as we were very tired and the backpack was becoming heavier. Made more stops and some fellas were already calling out to Murugan for strength. I took along vibuthi so rubbed some on and also some for the other gals. Somehow struggled all and then we came to some deeper crossings between rocks and pools of water. We crossed that and then kept going up. The reasons this kept happening was because there are 7 tiers to the falls we were ascending and at every one of the 7 we'll stop and wade through water and then keep on climbing.  Then we came to a cave which was like wedged and hidden from view. Very cool...like the movies. Went in and there was this large rock blocking the path so we had to climb over it using a linked chain that was against the wall. Like some mountain climbing thing. Then got to the other side and went on and on for almost another 40 minutes. The last half an hour was the worst. I was outta breath. The other girl kept sitting down because her legs couldn't go further. The boys all were so grim and steadfastly going on. They kept telling us that what we see finally will reward all our experiences. So we kept going and finally made it to the entrance of the camp area in 2 and 1/2 hours. About half an hour before time. So it was a great achievement and the little hike further up we hardly felt. Took photos and stuff and then went on and reached the camp site. The place we reached was called Jelawang Jungle. That's where we set up camp and gosh the boys were right. The view was excellent. We could see almost the whole of Dabong from our view. And guess where we were? Above the water falls 4th or 5th tier !!! There was a ledge or rather a big boulder of rock sitting on the hill and it was just on top of the waterfall. In that area, water flowed to the right and fell off the rock so the whole rock was for sitting and drying clothes and the dry, sunny area. We took nice swims there for a bit and then had to cross that span of water to get to the other side, climb a small incline and then go to more flat areas for camp. There were 2 more tiers but we were waiting for the next day to take the climb. Our camp site was in between tiers. Then it was the usual. Set up tent, prepare stuff, take a shower, had dinner and then went to sleep around 12.00 plus after sitting around fire".  Ok....i'll stop now. This was Day 1 at Dabong....i'll continue Day 2 another time.
