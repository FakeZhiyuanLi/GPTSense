      Went to see "lucia y el sexo" last night... yep, Sergio was right (http://www.overcaffeinated.net). It's a movie with big time explicit sexual content, yet even if you take that aside it's still a very good movie. ;o)   HA!... no it is actually a rather interesting story line in which the lives of quite some people just keep tangling, and the "time-line" keeps jumping back and forth.  I went over there with Chris (the german), and Hector, had a fun conversation with them about "life after college" and the things we should do. That has been a question in my heart for a while now... what should I do?. I'm scared of going back to WIU since most of the greatest memories that I have from over there are with Abby, yet she is no longer part of my life... I get the feeling that if I go back I will be rather depressed and lonely, with no real close friends to talk to... so, I guess I should skip. It's hard though to think that the little times I get to see her this semester will probably be the last times in ourlives... How will she do?, which is going to be her married name?, where is she going to be living?, will she be happy?... oh pues... I guess I'll never know.  I'm really getting tired of being a person from "derecha" (the right)... why can't I just don't give a dime and keep going, not caring about life and others?... I get too involved, I care too much, I want to help... and that sometimes makes me crazy. Mmmm... the "right and left" thing started up with Allan, and so that you get it really quick you can talk about people "in the left", people "in the center", and people "in the right"... It's a very confusing idea, but you can kind of understand it by checking out their "burdens" in life...  The burden of the people from the left is that, as much as they are anarchist, "loners", and they pretty much don't appreciate social   norms, they HAVE to live in society, they are allways "jailed" to the rules of this world, and when they actually do what they feel like, a lot of the times they end up in jail or a mad-house.  The burden of the people from the rigth, on the other hand, is that they care too much. They tend to be overly optimistic and possitive about life and stuff... they want to help others, make this a "happier" world... yet they can't... and then they get depressed. They care so much about someone that seems "sad" (from their perspective), that they get sad as well because that person can't be happy. (mmm... too simplistic way to put this things down... I hope you are getting the idea though).  And well... the people from the center?... they are sooooo uninvolved that they lack a sense of "group"... they don't really fit, and most of the times are the true loners, going back and forth between the left and right, yet never with the passion in life that would drive them to a specific goal. They don't really swim in the river... they just kind of float in it... yet it's not such a burden for them because, they really don't care.   By the way... I woke up thinking of abby this morning again... damn!... oh well. I'm going to a concert tonight, kind of pumped about that.

      I just had a rather nice conversation with the "Maruccia", and Memo... ha!, both nick-names start with an "m". Maruccia is a girl that I don't really know in person, but that I have gotten to know through msn and she's quite fun, Memo on the other hand is a friend from quite a while. Both conversations where very refreshing!, I could just be silly and smile a lot with this girl, and have a rather interesting conversation with Memo about lojban... somehow it doesn't seem like such a waste of time after all to learn that language (yes lojban is a language!).   I woke up feeling sad this morning, found my self thinking about abby again, I think I dreamt of her. It's interesting how she still lingers so much in my mind, but I guess it's only normal. Yet I can say that after thursday last week (feb-13) things just keep looking brigther on that note. Every day I'm hit with more things that just make me see that this is really for the best. Love is something that has to be "forged" with experiences, not "forced"... it just doesn't work that way. I was talking to Hector (no, not my self, another Hector) this morning and realized that last semester I was rather sad most of the times, and now, eventhough I think of her a lot, I feel very happy this way. (This I realized because I found my self walking, smiling and singing... and that's something that I hadn't done in a loooong time). She was an awesome person in my life, in every possible way, but I really see that we are both better this way. I honestly wish I had seen it this way before, but it's a process that you just have to live I guess... you just get so used to someone that at 1st the idea of "letting go" is very hard, yet "being used to someone" is not really the best reason to want to be with them.  I really hope abby and I can stay in touch though... I care tons for her and we've both gotten to share a lot. Time will tell I guess.

      I've been writting for a while now, about "life, the universe and everything"... it's a rather nice thing to do, very therapeutic and quite fun. Instead of just writting emails to people or my self, I'll start writting lot's of my thoughts and ideas on this thing!.  So, this will be the blogger of "Hector Padilla" (hector@latilde.com), a place to read about his life, his thoughts, and some other nonsense. Mmmm... I'll try an avoid talking in third person about me from now on!!!... (it's rather disturbing).  Here you may find interesting stuff, but as well you may find it rather boring and dull, he he he... so, if you "kind of enjoy it" sometimes, that's cool. If you just don't, I'm sorry... For that matter I guess I would need to work on getting a better life, (or a better writting style).  This shall be written in "spanglish", some times in english, some times in spanish... some times a weird mixture, and most of the times with tons of grammar and spelling errors!. So, deal with that!....  Enough for an introduction...

      by the way... I found out that my "tree" according to the Celtic Tradition is the "Olmo"... This would be the entry:   ARBOL DEL OLMO (la Mentalidad Noble) - de figura agradable,                      buen gusto en el vestir, de exigencias modestas, tiende a no olvidar los           errores, alegre, le gusta mandar pero no obedecer, es una pareja                    honesta y fiel, le gusta tomar decisiones por los demás, de mentalidad           noble, generosa, con buen sentido del humor, práctica.                                 sera?...

      Now I find my self very interested, in a messed up way, about this "pollo and karen" story... (eipipuz.blogspot.com)... mmm... reading someone's blog is deffinitelly a fun way to start the day!!...   Cool, I just found out that the "ficcus project" may still happen, which means quite some "unpaid" work!!... yipieee!!... he he he... yet it's fun and supposedly it will makes us all earn some good cash once the project starts rolling.  Yesterday was a very very good day... cannot really pin point why but I liked it... classes were great and fun (which is not that common), I played good magic, I had a fun lunch with Pollo, got a bunch of stuff done about this "Euro-CD", and went to my Reiki class. That my friends was awesome... Well, to begin with I arrived there early, and lolita started joking a little with me and about the fact that her daughter wanted to get my phone number, and she almost begged lolita to pleeeease get it from me!!... ha ha ha... now that was fun!. (lolita is a very spiritual, interesting woman, her daughter is as interesting too, he he he... and just the thought of that joke is funny)...   The class went great and we learned a lot about the handling of energies... it was very interesting when we were asked to "feel" certain problems with the aura of someone, yet we were not told what we would feel or where. By the end I was like "dude!, I deffinitelly felt this and this, there and there"... but I didn't know if I was right. Then lolita said what we were supposed to feel and where, wow!!... "i got it right!!"... it's great!!... This kinds of things are hard to explain... it's energy... you feel it... it's awesome.  By the end I had to direct the group meditation, and so I did... I ended with my tipical "chido" instead of the well known "asi sea, asi se haga, así se hará"... they all laughed... and by the end of that lolita said "mmm, now I will charge my daugher even more for that phone number of yours!"... he he he... it seems that she wants to invite me dance or something like that.

      To be awake...  just being asleep would be sooo much easier.  What is it to be awake?... am I awake?... at least a little... a little more than most people I am sure... why did I woke up?. Do I like being awake?... would I rather be asleep like everyone else?...  I was talking about such things once with Allan, and more recently with Daniel... they both think in a similar way about this... something happened to us, at some point in our lives, because of the context that we were living and such, that made us "different" than the bunch... I don't want to put my self in a "separate privileged group"... so far I don't know if I am priviliged because of this... yet I can really pin point so many differences among me and most people.  Interestingly enough I've managed to meet quite a few "like me"... like for some reason we "see it" in the eyes of those who are awake... we recognize each other, we even nod sometimes as we walk by someone with those eyes in the street. Talking to this people is so much fun, so interesting... so deep. It can be hours and hours about "stuff" that most people will find rather boring or useless... yet it's philosophy... about the very human nature of who we are, what we want and desire... our drives in life and such.  To be awake is to want more... much more. You see life in a special way, with the eyes of that person who can stay for hours looking at a tree and finding something amazing every minute of the experience... it's about "sensing" everything to an extreme, the smells, the touch, the looks... to experience life in wonderful proportions, in ways that most people just won't get... when we hurt, we hurt a lot, and we hurt for real... because having that "increased" sense of life, increases all feelings... those of joy and those of sorrow... and the interesting part is that we enjoy all those feelings, embrace them (even the pain), and try to learn from them... rejoice in the fact that we are "feeling something new" and see how it will "change us".  Most people don't do that... they just live... "like cows" Allan once said... they are productive and midly happy, they don't need anything else, so why bother?...   Am I awake?... why did I woke up?... would I rather be asleep?...  no... not now... even though sometimes the "cows" seem to have a much easier life, I believe the life of those who are awake is "fuller"... is it better?, maybe not... but I know that I'd rather stay like this....

      I hope this thing finally works... the DNS server of "latilde.com" somehow broke, thus no changes in this thing have been "published" yet.  It's been an easy week, with quite some work but enough time to rest... I'm taking it slow right now, actually getting a "decent" amount of sleep and such... besides I'm taking a lot of medice, bla bla bla. One of the things that I regret about this illness though, is that I am not able to sing, and I was really enjoying that class... the cool thing is that because of that I've emailed to the teacher a lot, and a "cool email talk" is going on... She is a nice woman, she cares about people.  Hopefully we will be done with that CD today, and this weekend might actually be fun... just some school work for saturday but that's it.   I went to have lunch with pollo today... very cool conversation, he is a good friend. A "hard" person so to speak, and I don't think I'll ever be able to completelly figure him out, but you can tell he is a really nice guy... kind of like the onions and "Shrek" (with "layers").... he he he.  By the way... the "white deck" that I built yesterday (called: "a la carga mis valientes"), was rather successful today... I guess I'm really getting a grip of this Magic thing... ;oP

      Ahhh.... still sick. I'm feeling a little better though, after the doctor's and many other person's advice I decided to take it easy and slow down in life... I'm resting more and such. Getting good sleeping, bla bla bla... let's see for how long I can put up with that. (I do sound like and old guy, don't I?... how sad, I'm only 22)...  Yesterday Abby called as I was sleeping, it was because "she needed to talk", to be honest it was a rather nice conversation and It felt nice to "see" that she still thinks of me as his friend and someone to call... I liked being able to listen and to give my input, I am almost sure that what I said was what she needed to listen. This guy Tim, (who I've never liked), keeps putting confusion in her mind... actually our relationship started going down hill big time since she started having conversations with him and such... he seems to be one of those christians that really do feel can just "tell people what to do" based on a couple of verses of the Bible... you know?. I'm really bothered by that... yet I'm glad that I was able to "release her" from his influence and made her make a sound choice about Reiki.  Nonsense... Still, that made me think of her a lot, and I woke up this morning dreamming of her... a dream I can still remember. This "letting go" thing is harder than I thought.  Life seems full of good stuff for life after college... if I cannot work at the TEC in the multimedia project, IBM is hiring a bunch of people (like 600) and they think highly of the TEC students... a manager from over there asked me to send him my curriculum... why not?. They are the ones who pay the best on the area!.

      Yesterday sucked... in more than one way actually. I'm feeling so freaking sick that just the idea of doing something other than sleeping makes me feel even worse... yet I cannot really sleep since my troat hurts so much when I swallow... :'o(  Oh well... yesterday I went to the WIU stand at the "study-abroad" fair, it was actually nice since I bumped into Todd and he is an awesome guy, he and his wife were always very nice to me while I was in Western. We talked a lot, and some good memories came back to me... I honestly did have a great time over there. The "bad" side of visiting Todd was that Abby did aswell... I'm starting to see a pattern here, if I bump into her or something like that I just start feeling depressed.  Since then I haven't been feeling that great... she looked rather good actually, but it was so odd being around her. It's really like she doesn't care about aaaall that we once shared. I think I'm kind of getting over her, and I am honestly not hurting anymore, yet the whole thing has me a little down... it's weird. Feelings are a difficult thing to explain, I guess being depressed feels like this maybe. There is no honest reason to be "down", yet nothing seems to put you up. Maybe I should start dating again, get this girl once and for all out of my mind like that.  On another note I guess I'm sooo not attending WIU for a masters, I guess I could wait a couple of years and then go for it. It's both for personal and professional reasons... I don't want to feel down because of the "abby thing", and I don't want to just study a masters there because "it's an easy chance"... I was talking to Daniel and it's very clear to me now that the world has so much more to offer in terms of accademics than WIU.  As well I went to the doctor... it seems that I got sick because of stress, over working and not taking care of my health... go figure.  The presentation about the advances in the CD kind of sucked... two out of 3 loved everything, but that 1 other person really made us feel down.

      work, work, work...  We got a bunch of things done today (almost done!!)... I couldn't make it to the party at Omar's house though, that sucked. Erik and Oscar are really cool guys, and hard workers... If I win the lotto I'll start my own company and hire them for sure!. ;o)  I had a pretty cool conversation with Daniel online... about what is it like to be "awake" and why it may happen. (later on that).

      Ok... yesterday was an awesome day!. I'm sooooo tired, yet I don't care.  I worked from 8:30am till about 7:00pm, all day doing this interactive CD for the thing in the European Union, it was rather fun actually, Erik and Oscar where here and those guys are as silly as I am, so it can't really get boring!. ;o)   There where several "highs" during the day, one was of course to finish all the "to-do" list that I had for that CD yesterday, but another huge one was the surprise visit of Rosario (an awesome woman-boss-and friend), and her two cousins. Now that was fun because she came over here with tons of riquiiiiisimos tacos at a point when we were reaaaally starving!, ha ha ha... and well, her two cousins were another surprise!. I got to meet more of "Maruccia" in person, great girl!. Can you believe that I was actually nervous when I was around her?. It's like, we've talk so much online, but when you meet someone like that in person it's always a little weird maybe. ;o)  The great thing was that she brought candy, and "PANDITAS"... YAY!!... mmm... muy rico.  He he he.... God bless that girl!.  At 7 Erik and I gave a lift to Marianna ("maruccia's real name"), Lucy and Oscar to McDonalds, near plaza del sol... it was a fun drive to that place, silly conversations going on in the car. Then Erik and I went to the "Teatro Galerias" to Delgadillo's concert.... We meet over there with Jose Luis, Tomas and Marisela, some guys from my singing class. It was AWESOME!!... GREAT!!!... WOW!!!.... did I say awesome already?!....  It was so freaking cool, he sung for more than 3 hours and a half, he had two companions playing chello, sax, flutes, percussions and such and man it was great... what a wonderful experience. The stories, the music, the lyrics... the musicians that played along him... wow... You can really really enjoy one of those concerts... It really lifted my spirits.  Anyway, I'll start getting some more work done now... Erik and Oscar should be here any minute and I am supposed to set the example! ;o)  Closing with a pice of a great Degadillo's song... (don't know why it's so important to me right now... ha!!)...  "Ay si te contara yo de penas  y razones por las que de lejanias  se han cargado mis canciones  pero que lo cuente el tiempo  porque hoy te hago esta promesa  amor, voy a olvidarte  con todas sus consecuencias  y a librar este pasado que  no dejo de arrastar.   Voy a olvidarme tu nombre  aunque sea lo ultimo que haga  aunque sea la ultima cosa  que me esconda lontananza  y ojala que en mi camino  no me abrume la añoranza  porque aunque muera de pena  voy a olvidarme de ti."

      The "onegai teacher" thing is rather funny actually... something that probably only my brother and erik can understand now... he he he... yet a very coold thing. It's an anime series, 12 chapters and one OVA... and it's GREAT!!!... I loved it, it's funny, it makes you laugh, cry, be silly and all... a nice romantic comedy about a guy and his relationship with his teacher... a woman from "out of this world"... The series is great, I'm so pumped about it that I want to buy the dvd's and even a figure of Kazami Mizuho (the teacher), to keep it by my monitor all the time... but it made me think a lot. (the same thing happened with Belldandy in "Oh! My Goddess!")...   This woman, Kazami Mizuho, is an awesome looking woman, like... AWESOME LOOKING!... yet she is as well terribly nice, funny, caring, lovely, etc, etc, etc woman... someone so great that you just know it cannot exist, but you just can't avoid falling in love with her and whishing you could find someone like that. Right now Erik and I are actually worried because we doubt our capacity to fall in love with a real lady after "meeting" this one... (well, we are not that worried but, kind of)... he he he... I even think it's one of the reasons why there are so much suicides in Japan, because they are depicted such a great life all the time on TV, and they just cannot have it!. She is great!!... why can't someone like that exist?!... and then you raise your standards and well, the rest of the story is well known, you want "so much" that you cannot settle for something really great and you are always unhappy.  Kazami is a great lady, she stands for everything that I would ever look for in a girl... smart, caring, pretty, funny, daring, understanding, sexy, loving, lovable... etc. But she does not exist... bummer...  Which leads me to happiness... how can we be happy?, or can you really be happy all the time?... what makes you happy?... makes makes you go on in this life?... a reason to wake up?... too much of a question right now for me... maybe I'll be able to answer by the end of my life... it's hard, and even harder now, to think of such things. What makes me happy?, life it self... to learn new things, to be around people that I care for and care for me, art, painting, the light, music, the starts... love... to walk while singing a tune, smiling to people as I walk... to sketch some cool drawing... to have projects... that makes me happy... why I don't know... what makes me unhappy?... ignorance, and all the things that I feel "pull me back" stopping me from going forward, in the direction that I would like to go...  (mmm)... on another note... I bumped into abby yesterday, it was one of the most ackward experiences in my life... so weird.. I really didn't like it nor enjoyed it... I felt uneasy because of it... I hadn't heard from her like in two weeks, and now you have me facing her, talking about "what we've been up to"... so weird. So "x"... after so much that we did together, shared, all that... and then just like that?!... argh!... it gave me the chills....  Thank God I didn't feel sadness anymore, but the uneasy feeling was just as enervating... and well, I've been told by a good friend of mine that this feeling never really goes away... there will always be that ackwardness... like, we made out and stuff like that!!!... I know her in body, soul and spirit!!... and then, pum!!... weird... no no no... let's find a Kazami real soon!!... ;o)  This now makes me thing about a talk that I had yesterday with some of the guys in hippos, and how we idealize someone and start "making plans for the future" and such... Julio is very down because of what happened with this girl letty... yet nothing really happened. In his mind a ton of this "would happen" later on, he dreamt a lot, idealized her... and well... that's the part that sucks. Something like that happened to me... yet I didn't feel like saying it with the guys because it would feel like "rubbing in their faces" the fact that I had that and they haven't... but I was very down because of it, because of the very same reason than julio, idealizing her and making "plans for the future" and hoping she would be the one and only for me... the difference is that I got a wonderful taste of that!!... We are talking about the fact that I lived with her, I woke up in the mornings when she kissed me good morning, went to bed kissing her good night... I felt that, I had that... the wonderful feeling of laying next to her and doing nothing, just being there together, falling asleep... I lived with her and saw all her "flaws", yet they seemed cute to me... she took care of me while I got sick, I did the same for her... yes... I dreamt too... and too much as well... the thing is that I got a taste of the "dream being true", and it made it harder for me... it's wasn't a dream anymore, I already knew how great it felt... and when it was taken away, with all those "dreams for the future", damn that did hurt....   that hurt a lot... and I think it still does... in a melancholic kind of way it does... but hey... we've gotta move on... I loved the experience, learned a lot... I take with me what is worth it and leave "the bad stuff" behind... I wasn't betrayed like Julio was... but I did hurt a lot, and for very well founded reasons too... besides I did feel betrayed. But there are more reasons to be happy around me, enough reasons to make that one "not matter as much"... Life is a great place to be in, and honest it feels good to be alive, to be just with my friends, and in very good comunion with my self... I am happier that I've been in quite a while... I guess I am moving on...

      Ok... here I am again, with only a few minutes to write before all the croud from my "ET" team show up. "ET" stands for Emprendedores Tecnologicos, nothing related to extaterrestial life forms... bummer.  The project we are working on has potential, software related and you can tell everybody in the team is very enthusiastic about it... let's see where it takes us. As for now, we can talk about how the week went... jezz!... there is so much to write about!... Maybe I should go "backwards" in time... starting from yesterday?... mmm... too confusing, maybe not. Overall the week has been very good actually, in more than one way... the only part that kind of sucks is school, I am really getting tired of going to classes and projects, why can't I just focus on really learning what I really want to learn?. (ie. openGl). The one class that I enjoy is SAAP, I dislike having to do so much homework and the project to be honest, but I find the classes rather interesting... the teacher is a guy that has a lot to share, and he really challenges us to think in better ways.  bla bla bla... he he he... I'm doing great in voice lessons, you can tell that I am trying to make up for all those semesters in which I didn't have time to go for it!. I'm more than 10 hours per week, but I really really like it... and the girls there are very nice too!... he he he... yet I'm a little dissapointed about it, they are too young for me. :o(    There is this one girl that I find very attractive and interesting, and I know she flirts with me and all, but the other day she asked me how old I was and when I said it she looked really down... he he he... I said "22" and you could tell the look of sadness in her face.... I even was like "why? why?... what's wrong with that?, how old are you?"... and well, at first she wouldn't say but when I heard I could only say "ah!!... que triste!"... he he he... right in her face. (she's only 16)... And well, 6 years younger may not be too much, but it is for me, and at this age it really shows. I'm graduating from college and well, she has a long way to get out of highschool!...  bummer... Nevertheless I love the voice classes, and eventhough the girls are all young I like the "flirty" enviroment going on... ;o)  One of the things that "struck me hard" during the week was the talk with Jaime... or David. It made me think a lot about friends and frienship... and about many of the good things that I have in my life. He and I are very similar in several ways, yet I think we "handle" those similarities with very different approaches... the whole "jaime thing" going on between the ocioso has been rather weird, and well, I am thankful that he opened himself to me and I had the chance to try and understand what he is going through. It really seems that his choices are very well founded from his point of view... and well... we all learn from things like that. I'm going to give him a reiki theraphy this sunday, let's see how it goes.  Which leads me to Reiki... what an awesome thing. I had my initiation this week, and it was a great experience. It's so hard to explain, or even to share, because for "outside" people it's just words... even silly ones about something that makes no sense whatsoever... yet it makes so much sense to me. During the iniciation I felt an awesome peace, a huge amount of energy going through me, and my heart was about to pop out of exitement... later I was told that I was given tons of blue light and two very special presents... now it is up to me to really use them.. but it kind of seems that, if I want to, I could really become strong at this energy stuff.... .... When I do it, it's something that I feel in my hands, something that others feel... argh!... no way to explain it...  Actually right now I am just thinking of erik and memo, and how they were saying that the whole pendulum thing and all where a hoax, and how it's something that I move even unconsciously, bla bla bla... there's no way I can make them believe or understand what I am talking about, it's frustrating because it's an awesome thing and they miss it... like "how can you not be open to such a great thing?"... but well, I guess it's my thing, and it will be for me to share with the ones that actually want it, and believe that at least it could do something for them.

      Every day it gets harder and harder to write on this thing... I guess I am going through the "middle of semester" stage, the time in which you realize you have so much to do by the end of it, yet you don't really have anything done yet... I am only taking 3 classes, so it shouldn't be a big deal... but it is, in the 3 classes I have big projects and besides, this semester hasn't really been "good for study"...  I have so much on my mind, the "abby thing", the "life after college thing", the "what the heck am I going to work on" thing, the "I am getting old" thing... and things of the sort. I know I'm only 22, there's so much ahead, a bright career and a good lady wait for me some where in the future... yet right now it's all a cloud of confussion... and it's really bugging me.  ... the phone is ringing... I'll keep writting later.

      Estoy pensando escribir un libro... creo que puede ser buena idea. No se si alguna vez sea publicado, o si llegue siquiera a ser medianamente bueno... pero creo que las primeras lineas van a ser las siguientes:        Y así la ví por última vez, caminando por la calle con        sus viejos tenis blancos, y con un bolso lleno de sueños       mojados en lagrimas.  Puede ser no?... muy probablemente escriba capítulos y avances de la historia en este blog... tal vez termine siendo un cuento corto.   La vida es un monton de juegos interesantes, y ultimamente creo que los he estado jugando bien. No recuerdo cuando fue la última vez que escribí en esta cosa... pero los eventos principales desde entonces de seguro que han sido "la salida de clarissa", "el cumple del heetor", "el torneo de magic", y la carne azada con los del CIE.  Basicamente fue un fin de semana lleno de actividades muy chidas... no hubo mucho descanso, pero si mucha distracción!. Le viernes fue un buen dia, fue el último dia en el CITE de clarissa y eso fue triste... pero me pidió jugar magic con ella "una última vez" y fue muy divertido... despues fuimos a comer con alex y la pasamos muy bien los tres. Ahhhh... estamos tristes porque vemos que el área esta perdiendo su brillo... como que si "desde arriba" nos estuvieran opacando poco a poco... eso es feo.  La noche fue muy padre... platique padrisimo con Hector y Enrique en el pancho reatas... la mayoría de las personas que fueron al cumple me eran totalmente desconocidas, pero aún asi la pase muy bien. Platica muy buena con enrique... al final demasiado filosófica, me dejó pensando mucho. Hablamos al final demasiado sobre cuestiones de abuso sexual y lo gacho que es... sobre traumas, la vida de las personas... el salir adelante... bla bla bla. Que interesante trabaja mi mente... maldita sea, de nuevo eso de ser de derecha... me entristece mucho que haya tanta gente que sufre tanto en silencio... por cosas muy feas.  El sabado pues mucha chamba en la mañana, pero en al tarde un torneo padrisimo de magic en casa del gabo y alex... perdi TODOS los juegos, he he he... pero me divertí mucho y creo que aprendí bastante sobre ese juego. Y el domingo fue de lo más interesante, tuve una reunión en la casa con los compañeros del CIE, un lugar donde hacia servicio becario en la prepa. Fue bien raro y bien padre a la vez, años que no veía a algunos de ellos... mucho "catching up" y platicar de que hemos hecho, planes, etc... es interesante ver a todos tan crecidos y "maduros"... incluso casi no tomaron nada de alcohol!!... he he he... ya como que cada quien anda en otras ondas...  Y pues ya... por cierto, hoy entregamos el CD!... yipiee!!!....

      I really don't know what's gonna happen in my future... should I worry so much about it?. Just last week I was thinking about devoting my self to art and "alternative healing", which sounds like a fun life style... then the chance of working at the CITE was there... but I don't think it's gonna happen, and eventhough it's a place that I have grown to love, I need to be able to move on... professionally it may not take me anywhere... Now I have this two choices: do I apply for a job in a place such as IBM?, or do I freelance and devote my self to multimedia until I can start my own company?... I am really considering the 2nd choice, if I can buy a super computer and get clients I can make things happen, for a year or two I may not earn much money, but I'll be doing what I really like. It's all about that isn't it?... happiness?... I have to worry about "making a living" though, and that's the part that has me worried.  If things happen with A4, and we get this "farmacias guadalajara" project, man, that would be awesome... the problem is that the founders of A4 are not still able to devote their 100% to it... two of them are still undergrads and julio may start working at IBM... that would leave me alone and I, as much as I want, know that I cannot handle such project by myself. Let's see how that goes and if they are interested in working with us... for a "starter project" in a "starter company" we are talking great... and it would be a great chance to make things happen for us in that matter, the beggining of our dream. A company where we go to play and have fun, doing what we really like... that would be great.

      Ok ok... there is almost nothing that a cup of coffee won't overcome... mmmmmmm... the smell... Maybe that's why I answered to allan and pollo that maybe, the other door to my heaven would be a coffee place... the "main room" according to them would be the CITE, he he he... which I honestly cannot deny since it's become kind of my "chantry", and a place where I feel really really confortable and "in control"... The question was, "where will you go once you open the doors to the cite?"... A coffee place of course!, "la paloma" most likelly, and where my friends are so that I can chat with as I drink a cup of coffee... mmmm...  That's one of the things that I enjoy the most... a good conversation... and a good conversation I had the other day with Tomas, a guy from my singing class, he he he. A really good fellow that, somehow, has the same kind of interests that I do. I keep thinking that I am "weird" in some ways, yet I keep bumping into people like me, so... either I am really not that "weird", or the idea of "Dios los hace y ellos se juntan" really does apply. I already agreed that I am going out for coffee one day with him, it really seems that we can talk a lot about "life, the universe and everything"... somehow he felt confortable enough with me as to talk about this girl that he really likes, yet they are "best friends" and even though he loves her, and would really like to be "more than friends" with her, he can't... he says he "knows it won't happen"... oh man... being there, done that... it hurts and it feels awful... I want to talk to him, tell him about "victor and ireri" and how that story came to be... I think those two have the same situation than my brother and his girl had... they just need a little pushing to "get it on"... ;o)  The one interesting thing about him and the girl he likes, is that he is 6 years older than her... yet they do really seem to make a nice couple!!!... and I found that out when we were walking down the hall and then this girl from choir walked by and I "shyly" said "hI"... he he he... I pointed out how I was for some reason feeling really attracted to her, yet I felt "dirty" because she is 6 years younger... and well, he said that it should not be a big deal!!... ha ha ha... and then we talked... I think that I am starting to get "infatuated" for this girl, I find her extremelly flirty and interesting!!!... like, really really interesting... he he he... and I almost feel silly because of it. And aswell I get nervous around her, and all those silly things that make this "game of love" so much fun... I just want to make sure though that I am ready to jump into something new, or if it's just a phase I'm going through... The "bounce relationship concept" is well known, and I don't want to get into that!!...

      My day started up rather well... I was feeling great actually when I came into the office!!... pumped because I could finally come up with a new design for my homepage, stuff like that... and then, I open my email... ta-taaa-ta-taaaan!... an email from abby!!!.... Why?!?!... why?!?!.... and well, the part that was really bothersome were the contents: (she kindly wanted to share this quote with me, since she knows I soooooo need it)...  .....When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so  .....long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been  .....opened for us. .....- Helen Keller  ARGH!!!!... why?!?!... 1st, all of a sudden she decides to break my heart AGAIN, then she decides to kick me out of her life all of a sudden!, and now she writes to me stuff like this?!?!... Ok ok ok... I know it's a nice phrase, even wise... But I don't like it comming from her!. I know I have to "get over her", move on, what not... (which I think I've been handling rather well), but getting a phrase like this?!... from her?!?!... give me a break please!!!... a little too late to be caring about my feelings, and a little too late for "worrying" about that... mostly since right now I'm feeling terribly attracted to another girl... (which is a little bothersome too)... Yes abby, you DID close one door to happiness in my life, and I cried because of it, but WORRY NOT!... I didn't stare for too long at it... lost cases are lost cases... I guess the part that really bothers me is she "helping" me get over her, argh!!.... and the fact that she won't give me some credit in the fact that I can handle such things by my self...  I was about to write a bunch of stuff today... about the week, this girl that I am getting interested in, the going to "farmacias guadalajara" and such... I will later I guess... but I've got to stop writting right now. Other wise this email of hers will influence the mood in all my writting...

      42 is just a number, yet in holds in itself the answer to everything... to that one question that would make it all make sense... yet we don't know what to make of it. Yes, we know it's 42... so what?... now what do we do with it?... how can we apply that knowledge to life, the universe and everything?... we have the answer yet it's good for nothing!... that happens all the time. We cling to the bliss of "not knowing", and eventhough the answers are presented to us, saying "it's not that easy" releases us from the responsability of our own happiness.  It's not about knowing the answer... it's about making it have some meaning in our lives, in a practical way, and live accordingly. How to be happy?, how to let go?... we humans seem to cling to all those things that make us misserable, we seem to enjoy them. Eventhough there are thousands of reasons to smile we preffer the sorrow, the sadness that comes to our mind because of one little thing... I'm thinking about "the matrix", and that part in which the "robot" sais that they lost thousands of humans because they rejected the "reality" in which they were completelly happy... they had to live in a misserable world so that they could be happy... ha!!... so weird, but it makes sense.  oh well...  by the way... FELIZ CUMPLEAÑOS MEMO!!... ^_^

      finally fixed... I think... now you can browse through the archives of this blogger...  the things you have to do to avoid those adds!!!... he he he... ^_^  Ok so... later I shall write about "life, the universe and everything"... as for now I should be doing some homework and I already "wasted" about an hour trying to fix that thing. Anyway, it all comes down to 42 after all.  ¬_¬

      "Puente"... some good relaxing days with out so much to do... school wise I should be worrying about several things right now, but somehow they don't seem like a priority... resting and fun sounds like the "thing to do" as for now.  I don't have classes on friday anyway, yet it feels different... and the fact that everybody has it free makes it cooler...   wow... some girl just logged in on msn and has this message by her contact: "Sex is evil, evil is sin, sins are forgiven, so lets begin."... damn!!... I just found out who she is!!!!... she is this girl from choir that I am really getting to like!!!... wow... man... this really puts me "off my guard"!!!!....  ok ok ok... so right now I need to get back to my further state of mind and work on this blog thing... I shall comment on that later!.   So, I just came back from "la paloma" where I meet with Anabel, a pretty cool girl that I've known since highschool, and I got the chance to catch up with her life and stuff.. we talked a lot and for quite a while... still I have that great feeling that life is smiling at me... such a great talk. Anabel went abroad aswell and she stayed in Canada for a year, a good amount of the talk was about sharing out experiences while out side of mexico... it's very interesting, I think we both are alike in a lot of ways, she is very from "derecha", and a huge catholic girl... we are alike in several ways, she's too much of a religious like that to me, but I like how strong she is in her beliefs, and the fact that she is not a hypocrit like most "believers"... great talk, great girl... hope it happens more than once in the future.  Last night Erik stayed over, we had a pretty cool time I bet, mostly because we played what were probably the best games of "smash brothers" so far, erik and victor are reeeeeally good at it, and it was so much fun just to watch them play... I don't usually enjoy doing so but this two guys were like "wow"... I played aswell and well, I can proudly say that I was able to kill them both a couple of times too.  :o)  We aswell had pretty cool talks about the "paranormal" stuff, probably the climax of that was when my brother talked about his experience in the "past lives" metidation and all the stuff he saw and felt... we were all in shock and having goose bumps because of it.   What else?... oh yes... choir and stuff was fun, and this girl keeps looking better and better to me!!... man, is it spring?!?!... why am I starting to like all this girls and all?!?!... I was even bold enough to tell her "hey!, te ves muy bien con el cabellos suelto!, dejalo asi!".. when she was playing with her hair!. I surprised my self saying that and thinking - dude!, you don't say stuff like that to girls!, you are shy!, remember?!?!... - he he he.. yet it was fun, she seemed to like the comment, at least she smiled and left her hair like that the whole time!!... :oP  (by the way, I am talking by msn to her right now... mmm... that's distracting me from this blog thing, so, if I am not making sense that would be the reason!... ok?)...  tra la ra... what else?!?... well, tu sum it all up the week was good, life is smiling!, I'm chatting to this girl now, and waiting for tomorrow so that I can go with Maruccia out for the weekend!!... yipiieeee!!!...  so long and thanks for all the fish!... :oP

      This was my plan for tonight: get home, sleep.   So... why am I here sitting again in front of the computer?!... I feel a terrible compulsion to write!!... I feel so good, so happy, so excited, that I have to let it out!!... man, this "doors of opportunity" thing have struck me so much latelly, just yesterday I had a grrrreat talk with a guy that really wants me to be part of a huge project, taking care of the entire "interface and multimedia" stuff, and we are talking big... I feel so pumped about everything!!... I had a great class today with "el rudo", this is a class that I always enjoy and well, I got to talk for quite a while with him afterwards, on a "one to one" basis, and man he has a lot to share... Eventhough I am confused about which path to take, which path to walk, I feel so excited about life... I don't know why really, is it spring?... whatever, but I'm glad I'm feeling this way... still don't know what's gonna happen, when I commit to one "path" I will have to say NO to several other good opportunities, at least for a while, and that's a huge responsability in my life.. but you know what?... the best will happen, I'm somehow sure...  Today I had a lot of group meetings and school stuff to do, but eventhough it's still a lot, I feel confident it's all gonna work out. I had a great talk with Julian, with annette and with Maruccia as well... they all happened at different times of course. I really liked talking to Maruccia and than talk got me thinking a lot... it reminded me of Michael Ende (one of my favorite authors) and "momo", my favorite book. The talk was great of course, and we even talked about spending the weekend together with some friends and all, the idea sounds great!... and man, somehow the "momo" thing soooo fits in my life and the way I am experiencing it... it's all about being happy, about living your dreams and not letting the "expected" and the "usual" life kill you as a dreamer, it's about making thing happen!!... about avoiding the "rational" way until you become a "gray fellow", about taking risks and following your heart... being passionate... living...   I just read a little from momo again, a quote that I love, and I shall put it here again:   Existe una cosa muy mistoriosa, pero muy cotidiana. Todo el mundo participa de ella, todo el munda la conoce, pero muy pocos se paran a pensar en ella. Casi todos se limitan a tomarla como viene, sin hacer preguntas. Esta cosa es el tiempo.  Hay calendarios y relojes para medirlo, pero eso significa poco, porque todos sabemos que, a veces, una hora puede parecernos una eternidad, y otra, en cambio, pasa en un instante; depende de lo que hagamos durante esa hora.   Porque el tiempo es vida. Y la vida reside en el corazón.    isn't that so true?... so great?!... I mean, just think about it!... a meter is a meter, 100 centimeters put together, you measure a meter and it's a meter... period... same thing happens with a liter, and all this different standard measures... A meter will always be a meter for you, you always "experience" it the same way, see it the same way...  but how about time?!... eventhough my clock may mark "an hour", I will always experience it and perceive it in different ways... it's 60 minutes after all, but they "feel" different, they clearly are not the same, they can feel like an "eternal instant" (like when you give your first kiss), or a "terribly long hour" (like in a boring class)... because time, eventhough it's "standard", is not experienced the same way always...  it's not all rational, it deals with feelings, with matters of the heart... isn't that interesting?!... despite the fact that in the "material rational" world, and hour is an hour, in the "sensitive subjective" world it can be so different.  I'll try and live a life full of good hours and minutes... filled with great memories and little regrets... I don't know how I will feel about things later on, but for now I am pumped and happy... and I try to keep this up... (as worried as I am about this way that Mr. Bush is going for agains Iraq, and all the "evil" in the world, there is still a place for the dreaming and the dreamers, the hopes, and those I am sure will trully die last... despite all their massive weapons).  There is a huge lack of love in this world... let's see what we can do about it.

      One of the bestest weekends in quite a while... I so enjoyed it... it made me think a lot about the "door to happiness" think that abby wrote, and honestly, I couldn't help to laugh. So many doors to happiness are oppening right in front of me, so many reasons to smile and enjoy... today driving home from a birthday party I couldn't help thinking this:  I AM HAPPY... I feel "full" and happy, so many projects are oppening up, and all of them related to multimedia and the stuff I really enjoy... people from different directions contacting me and presenting opportunities... I have nothing to complain.  It all kind of started on friday, when I was rehearsing the "solo" song that I may sing... I really enjoyed the rehearsal and the teacher was happy about how we did. Classic music has so much dept, I confess that I've never really been a fan of it, but now I cannot stop being amazed by it, now that I recognize all the different voices and the stuff they do, the instruments, etc... good stuff. But of course the milestone of the day was the party... during the night... mmmm?... so, maybe it wasn't the milestone of the day, he he he, it was the milestone of the night!!!...  I went to Mariana's bday party, (or marucha's), and I had an awesome time!. First I arrived to Centro Magno since I was told the place was right in front of it, over "lopez cotilla", yet since I couldn't really find it I decided to call Oscar and then they came and picked me up... Man, I have to say one thing: Mariana looked veeeery good... I was nervous!, he he he... that is one of the funniest, weirdest, nicest feelings, to be kind of nervous about a girl!!... he he he... I gave her a hug and a CD that I bought, and well.... the night started. We went to a place that we couldn't enter (we needed to reserve), so we went back to the Centro Magno and a bar over there... and there we talked, and talked, and talked... Oscar and Lucy were so funny, and even Cesar and other guys... he he he... the "carrilla" was obvious... ha ha ha... I just spent the whole night talking to Mariana and well, of course they kind of made fun of it!... I did have a very cool time talking with her, it wasn't about the conversation or the topics, it was about the idea that I really enjoyed the conversation, and every minute that passed I felt more and more comfortable talking to this girl. At one point someone came who made me feel a little bit uneasy... like he really hated the idea of me being there (I'm overly sensitive to those things), later I was told that the guy was Mariana's ex, obviously he didn't like the idea of me being there, and even got jelous of it... dude, she is not even his girl anymore!!... I can understand him though, but he's out of place if he is going to act like that... anyway, I'm only starting to know this girl!... so far I can only say one thing: she is great in every way... he he he....   Anyway, I talked a little with Oscar, Lucy, Cesar, and Agustin (mariana's bro), and it was all fun... at a point they decided that they wanted to go to "los tacones de maria", I wasn't going to go since I needed to head back home with my brother, but good ol' oscar said that I MUST go, and he offered to dropped me off after it... he he he... Of course the idea sounded great, so I went along!. The bar is a pretty cool place, there I could talk more with all of the guys, and even more with Mariana... mmmm... I'm actually worried she may be reading this, but I have to say one thing: she looked awesome under that candle light!... ehem... ok... so, yes... I had a glass of great wine, and a great talk with friends and a nice lady... what else can you ask for a good friday night?!.  The drive back home was very nice, oscar drove me all the way and we talked a lot about the night, mariana, him and lucy, this guy who turned out to be mariana's ex... etc...   It was a great night!!...   Saturday was good too... I helped Mox and Alba to get a presentation ready and did some work with my ET team... they headed home and had a fun evening with Memo, Julio, Blanco and my brother... we played magic, saw the entire "onegai teacher" series (again!), and role played for a little... he he he... it was a lot of fun to be honest... it's nice to relax and be silly with some friends. I really needed that. We did so much stuff and till so late that they decided to just spend the night in here, which was rather nice, and gave us the chance to role play and all... the game was the silliest thing (about the "care bears"), but we all had a good laugh... And well, today after memo and julio left we went to Claudia's bday party (lolit'as daughter, "reiki people"), and well... I had a great time there too... I keep being told that I need to pursue my "reiki studies" and work on them, because it seems that I could really do well in this "energy handling" thing...   Man... I did so much stuff... but all of it, pretty much, made me think one thing:  I AM HAPPY ... for real, I have good friends, good hobbies, good activities, and so many windows of opportunity... I loved going out with Mariana and the guys on friday, hopefully it will happen again, I as well loved working and helping my friends saturday morning, the "geek stuff" of the evening, and today's party... right now i am even pumped about doing homework and all... It all depends of the "filters" through which you see life!!... I'll keep working on that, on keeping the "possitive filters" working... jezz i feel like I want to keep writting... but honest, I shouldn't... it would be about the same thing over and over... how great I feel and how much I am pumped about my life and the future... he he he... sweet!!...

      Life is nothing but an empty canvas, it's up to you to get your brushes moving and make art out of it.  SUCCESS!!!... we kicked ass in the presentation today!!... We all have been working so much on it, and dude, it was worth it!!... 3 teams presented their projects today, one came out victorious... guess which one?!?!:.. YES!!... US!!.... can you tell I'm braggin?!, yes I feel totally happy and content about how we did. It wasn't only that the flash presentation came out great, the attitude that we all had, so much confidence and a feeling of "I'm in charge of this business, the king of the hill". We were all wearing dark suits, man.... he he he... it was great, period. ;o)  Lot's to talk about, but right now I feel like getting away from the computer for a while!!...   see ya...

      I´ve cried tears of sorrow,  I´ve cried tears of joy, There´s always been tomorrow, and tomorrow, i´ll enjoy!!!!...  Man... I´ve never cried like this from a movie before... that erik really was serious when he said that I would like this movie, and cry because of it... ¨a walk to remember¨... and remember it I will...  I haven't had enough sleep in the past two days, actually have had a huge lack of it... but man, I just can't sleep right now... I am not sleepy at all... what do I feel like?, dancing!... singing, drawing... writting... thus I'm here...  What is this movie about?, why did it moved so much in me?... man... it's about true love, period... and how much love can do in someone's life, and how much worth it has... so many people are afraid to fall in love, so many people just fear rejection or the idea that "it's not really forever, and I don't want getting hurt afterwards"... love is eternal, while it happens... love is worth feeling, even if just for a minute... even if it will end and bring sorrow... that one minute would make this all thing called ¨life¨worth it...  Look at me... I just steped out of a "nice" relationship, and I was truly devastated... It hurted, it hurted like hell... too many tears I cried, but I would go for it again. If I could go back in time and chose, whether or not to do it, I would... because eventhough I fell, and it hurt, the sight from up there has given me a new great reason to keep on breathing and smiling... and was great enough to make me want to climb up that mountain again, no matter what... and even if I have to fall several times, I know that if I keep on going up there, I'll eventually stay... and that man, would make all the falls worth it...  What a great movie... what a great feeling it is to be alive.

      Man... life... it's such a fun place to be at!!...  He he he... I am supposed to be studying networking, a topic that I officially hate, but since I cannot concentrate at all, I might aswell just focus on real important things, such as my blog!. (why can't I concentrate?... because there is a meeting going on right next to the cubicle that I am in, and I am listening to some of the stuppidest things ever said... by some people that I rather not mention but man.. it's soooo bugging me!!!!.... people with a computer science major cannot design?!?!!?.... I think I'll need to kill a couple...)... argh... maybe most computer-geeks are not designers, but some of us are quite good at it!!!!....  he he he...  So... how has the week been?... good, I've been working my ass off, but it's been awfully good!!!... Since I went this past weekend to "concepcion" I've been having to work a lot during the last two days, with hardly any sleep, yet I really don't feel that tired!!... I just got the "onegai teacher" dvd's (yeah erik!, die of envy!!... ha ha ha), and  the "thing" with this girl from choir really has me all "up in the clouds"...  Remember when I talked about this girl that I was starting to like, but I found out that she was "too" young, bla bla bla?... well, the "flirting" has deffinitelly stayed around... and as I think I've mentioned I have surprised my self complimenting her, telling her how great she looks and all... (which is not something that I usually do)... and well, despite the fact that I've tried to get her out of my mind, I just can't... I'm officially infatuated with this woman... and there's something I should be able to do about it, otherwise this feeling would just kill me!!...  I have chatted with her for quite a while now, and the more I do it the more interesting I find her, and just the other day I was able to talk to her for an hour or so, and man... I liked it so much. (she was wearing her hair down by the way, which I told her to do the other day and she seemed to like the idea!)... And the part that struck me about the talk was when she said that she likes "older guys" because the ones her age are too inmature for her, and how she had dated guys about 21 or so... That would deffinitelly kick the "she's too young" barrier away!!!!!!.... and man, she is sooooo interesting... there is just something about this girl that I have to discover!!... (by the way, we danced a lot in class, I asked her to be my partner and she agreed... and dancing with her, watching her smile and all... man it felt good)...

      While I'm trying to download a crack for "swish" and fighting against those "porn-pop-ups" I'll give my self the chance to write on this thing... By the way, from now on when you start looking for a crack put your computer on "mute", other wise you might end up facing a "voice-pop-up", which I didn't know existed, and you may see your self in trouble. I was happily looking for this crack when all of a sudden the "sexy" voice of some chick starts, saying "stuff" and making "weird" sounds... yeeep... big no no.  So now I see my self working, and working a lot... paying for this "gettaway" weekend that I had. Eventhough I knew I had this much to do I decided to just "let it be" and go to Concepcion de Buenos Aires with this guys... I may not get a lot of sleep in the next couple of days, but it was well worth it my friends!. I went with Oscar, Lucy, Mariana, Agustin, Lucy's mom, and mariana's mom... he he he... I was all nervous about going with Mariana and this guys, since I don't really know them and it just seemed like a big "jump" all of a sudden, I guess I really like this girl, but I don't know if I like her "that" way just yet... and it felt weird to go with the family and all, somehow I think Oscar, Lucy and them feel like we could "get it on"... it could all just be my imagination though, and there may be nothing more than a nice friendship lurking around... :oP  The weekend was great, this place Concepcion is a nice little town, with not much to do but rest, sleep, eat and walk around nice little streets... as soon as I step foot in that place my "pace" changed a lot, and I felt like in another dimension... so rested and relaxed, with no worries and such. We walked a lot around, even went to visit the "pateon"!!... he he he... and talked for quite a while too. Mariana's family is very nice!, and well, it turns out that Agustin and I know several "common" people, and I bet we have seen each other before like in parties and all!!... the talks in general were great, the walks...   I hope I didn't seem too "out of it" or weird... I kept spacing out a lot... like thinking, or going in little "astral trips"... funny somehow, but I felt like I was very comfortable like that... a little out of it... I am always very "into it", taking care of things and making things happen... being relaxed like that gave my mind a very good chance to get away for a while and relax...  Awesome weekend... I am grateful to Agustin and Mariana that they invited me... hopefully I'll get to hang out more with this girl... of course I'll keep on writting about how those things go later on!...

      Otra cosa muy fregona ha sido lo del ceneval, y el cotorreo con los compas... aunque el examen es ridiculamente largo y da mucha flojera, ha sido el marco para reunirnos en bola todos los compañeros, y la verdad es que me caen muy bien. El maldonado, el perro, frank, vaya... todos son muy cotorros la verdad... con alba platico bien rico, y no se diga con el allan. Definitivamente el par de charlas con el allan han hecho que esto sea mas llevadero... que triste que ya no puedo platicar tanto con el, pero en realidad son platicas muy interesantes, refrescantes y "retadoras"... pensando bien me doy cuenta que, casi casi, solo tengo charlas de ese tipo con daniel y con el allan... animales en extincion defintivamente...   Muchas de las charlas con el allan, para variar, girar alrededor de lo metafisico, la magia, los planos astrales y manejos de la energia... es siempre muy padre rebotar ideas con el sobre la vida y crear nuestras pequeñas "sumas filosoficas"... a veces pienso que seria la onda grabar esas charlas y publicarlas despues... quien quita y si habria personas que las leerian con mucho interes.  Por cierto... hoy en el transcurso de la mañana llego un mensajito a mi celular... "mucha suerte en tu examen   ~tanya"... se vale decir que me senti como niño chiquito enamorado?!.... ha ha ha, y lo mas cura es que se noto, y las personas con las que estaba se percataron (alan, alba, frank... etc)... Tanya y yo nos parecemos en muchisisisisimas cosas, entorno familiar, relacion con nuestros padres, asmas, alergias, pasiones, gustos... todo... y el "asunto" de la edad cada vez parece menos importante y mas tonto... que cura!!...  Que la vida... ahhh si!... y en cuanto a "business" las cosas pintan chido tambien... estamos teniendo constantes charlas con un grupo de cuates que, al parecer, estan interesados en formar una alianza estrategica con nosotros y crear una unidad de negocios muy fregona... quien sabe si suceda, pero si pasa las cosas van a pintar bien. Ya la union con el obby, yanqui y edgar esta formalizando, y ya tengo mi cubiculo con ellos y todo... acabo de comprar una compu fregona, y la alianza con a4 sigue en pie... en cuanto a lo profesional el futuro esta lleno de incertidumbre, pero de muchisisisisimo punch y proyectos fregones... ojala las cosas se acomoden bien!.

      Titulo de Propiedad...  Ya ayer varios me dijeron que, un "titulo de propiedad" ya esta mas cañon.. he he he, por qué?... pues porque traía una etiqueta pegada en el brazo que decía "propiedad de tanya"... he he he, que ella me pegó,  y yo, obviamente, no despegué por un buen rato... ;oP  Qué ha sido de la vida en este último par de días?... un torbellino muy padre de emociones, charlas buenas, y música. La semana en general ha sido poca madre la verdad... y muchisimo ha tenido que ver con esta mujer. La vi diario, todos los dias, y ahora que muy probablemente no la vaya a ver, puedo casi aseverar que la extraño... demonios. Muy probablemente cuando uno lucha "contra" estas cosas es peor... intente de manera activa "matar" la idea de algo con ella... pero ya es mas bien innevitable.  El jueves fue particularmente padre, mas que nada porque sali con ella en la tarde, fuimos a una clase de canto muy chida, y luego a un cafe (el rico cafe kattra, sobre niño obrero). En el cafe platicamos, y mucho, sobre N cosas... desde las charlas tontas de las caricaturas que veiamos, hasta cosas mas serias e interesantes de gustos personales y maneras de ser... cosas de la vida en general... la pasamos poca madre, ella insistio mucho en que fue asi. (yo tenia que estar a las 9 en una junta de trabajo... eran las 9:15 y yo seguia con ella en el cafe... he he he... hay prioridades en la vida señores!!)...   Despues el viernes, por "casualidad" nos topamos temprano en la mañana y terminamos pasando casi todo el dia juntos... durante mi break del CENEVAL (examen largo y enfadoso que se convirtio en razon de burla y buenos chascarrillos entre los "torturados participantes"). y despues del examen lo pase con ella. Allan la conocio... he he he. Ya en la tarde estuve como hasta las nueve con esta chava, de noche, con la luz de la prepa y al lado de las fuentes... demonios, porque se veia tan bien?!... me gusta, la neta. Lo mejor de todo es que creo que yo le gusto... cuando fui a visitarla a su stand, en cuanto vio que estaba por ahi corrio a saludarme muy contenta, y me pidio un abrazo... ahhh...  he he he...  Creo que ambos damos señales de que "nos gustamos"... el hecho de que caminaba super cerca de mi, buscado pretextos para el contacto fisico (los dos) y todo... o sera solo mi imaginacion?... no creo, ya es demasiado... ahhhhh... que loco!!.... sera culpa de la primavera?.... (por cierto, en el cafe descubri que ella es "escorpion", y en mis lecturas he encontrado que escorpion y cancer son casi casi la pareja ideal... ha ha ha).  Lo mas cura fue el hecho de que en la noche, ambos ya cansadisimos, ns encontraos en el msn de nuevo... yo creo que mutuamente nos buscabamos... y la charla del msn estaba, en realidad, tirando hacia "la declaracion"... esas cosas no me laten virtuales... pero hubiera sido demasiado facil. Ella decia lo bien que se la habia pasado conmigo en la semana, que si yo no lo notaba lo bien que la pasabamos juntos... etc. Obviamente yo reforzaba la idea, porque asi ha sido la semana, y no perdia oportunidad de decirle lo chida que era y lo bien que se veia... he he he... yo creo que "este arroz ya se cocio"... ahora estoy en la disyuntiva... quiero que se arme?... estoy listo?... mejor amigos?... vaya... no deberia racionalizar tanto esto... "go with the flow" yo creo... me late un chorro... chance y en unos dias tendre noticias interesantes al respecto.

      "Quiero ser en tu vida, algo más que un instante, algo más que una sombra y algo más que un afán Quiero ser en ti mismo una huella inborrable y un recuerdo constante y una sola verdad. Palpitar en tus rezos con temor de abandono. Ser en todo y por todo complemento de ti. Una sed infinita de caricias y besos, pero no una costumbre de estar cerca de mí. Quiero ser en tu vida, una pena de ausencia y un dolor de distancia y una eterna amistad. Algo más que una imagen y algo más que el ensueño que venciendo caminos llega, pasa y se va... Ser el llanto en tus ojos y en tus labios la risa, ser el fin y el principio, la tiniebla y la luz  y la tierra y el cielo... y la vida y la muerte. Ser igual que en mi vida has venido a ser tú..."  que chido poema de Martín Galas Jr...

      Y ahora estoy aqui de nuevo... escuchando el gloria de vivaldi y pensando cosas, muchas cosas...   Ayer en canto me di cuenta de un par de cosas... esta chavita, definitivamente, me gusta... no puedo hacer nada al respecto mas que "ir con la marea" y ver a dónde me lleva ese sentimiento... lo "lindo" de todo el asunto es que, al parecer, ella muestra interés en mi... lo cual siempre es bueno. Una infatuación correspondida es vigorizante, divertida y muy pícara... es el coqueteo mutuo, "duro y directo", lo que la hace tan divertida, probablemente no llegue a nada pero ya esta sirviendo de mucho... Es una sensación que lo hace a uno sonreír mucho y sentirse bien consigo mismo... veamos cuanto nos dura... ;o)  Por otro lado, me di cuenta de que tengo un serio problema... algún interesante caso de inseguridad. La vida no es para andar inseguro caminando por ella, es para vivirla y vivirla bien... nada de timideces o miedos injustificados... Pero entonces por qué?. Justo antes de clase estuve ensayando mi probable *solo*  (probable porque chance y se lo dan a alguien mas), y la verdad es que sonaba muy muy bien... me dije a mi mismo -wey, si cantas asi en clase vas a dejarlos con la boca a bierta -. ¿Fue ese el error?, ¿confiarme?... El caso es que en la clase, a la hora de la hora, las cosas no salieron ni la mitad de bien... muy frustrante para mi y para la maestra, ya que al parecer ambos estamos muy conscientes de que puedo cantar mucho mejor. Ahora ella esta en la dificil decision de "escoger a hector, que canta bien, pero es inseguro con su voz?", o "escoger al otro chavo, que no canta tan bien, pero proyecta mucha seguridad?"... dificil decision para ella, clara para mi... -ve por el seguro- diría yo.   Cante o no ese solo, no hay problema... el problema esta en esos nervios inutilizantes... en esa inseguridad que de seguro se refleja en muchísimas otras cosas en mi vida, cosas que probablemente no había notado pero que estan haciendo "click" y que quiero resolver. Creo que uno tiene todos los elementos y armas para hacerla bien en este mundo, siento que los tengo, pero no les saco todo el jugo que podría... ¿qué tengo que resolver?, ¿qué me hace sentir tan inseguro en ciertas cosas?... Cuando se trata de sacar proyectos conjuntos adelante tiendo a ser parte fundamental del equipo, por lo menos desde un punto de vista de motivación y optimismo, siempre doy todo y con todo, y logramos resultados fregones... pero ¿yo solo?... ahi es donde pareciera que hay un problema... en ayudar a los demas y a un bien común no hay problema... en ayudarme a mi mismo, sacar adelante una meta vilmente individual (egoista?) pareciera haber algo grave...  Es la nueva mision... averiguarlo...

      I just posted to *the-dreaming*... seems that blog is finally going to go somewhere!!... cool!.  Anyway... so, what is it that I wrote and couldn't post because the /%&#$/&() connection broke on me?... Well, several things... but they somehow don't seem as important right now. I guess that's the problem with the blogs, if you don't write the stuff right when you feel it, it comes out fake and constructed... not real and felt.  I was just talking to Erik about last friday with this girl, and how I should, at least, give it one more try... I went out with her (spent some time in her house, with her mom, and then to a coffee-shop) and despite the fact that I really enjoyed it, I really feel like "it's not meant to be"... she is *too* young and *too pampered* maybe... I got this idea because of the way she holds her self, and I can tell she is a "high maitainance" kind of woman, which really gives me hueva right now... and besides I don't have the money to support a relationship with one of those... Anyway, she remains very attractive, and very interesting... she is well read, likes computers, graphic design, (flash stuff and all), she plays video games, bla bla bla... so... mmm... I won't judge her because of our last date... he he he, but I won't push anything... if it happens in happens and I'll let it be... ;o)  Let's see how she acts around me today in class.  On the other hand it was a pretty decent weekend, quite some fun, with lot's of hours of "anime" which is kind of becoming the "week-end thing to do"... he he he, and I borrowed a copy of vampire:the mascarade, from which I intend to prepare a cool rpg, it would be my first one, so we'll see how it works.  On a talk I had yesterday with a friend of mine I was able to see one thing: maybe I'm not ready for something "new" in terms of love life... the thing with this girl that I dated on friday, and how I feel about marianna, makes me feel that I still have to be a "free agent" for a while... But who knows... this love thing is funny, and when you start to feel it, you start to feel it... on saturday though I saw how I still need to work a couple of things out. I went to a "holopgraphix" therapy, an "alternative healing" method based on input-response that tries to dig into the subconcious to fix things up, and start reprogramming your self to "make things right"... It's funny how I started with "I don't feel confident enough when singing alone" and ended up with the fact that I have to work with forgiveness, letting go, and another bunch of things. So... let us work on them!.  Anyway... I'll try now to be somehow productive... ;o)

      I'm rather bugged right now... I had just written a lot, talking about dating, the date I had on friday... my day on saturday and things of the sort... and well, it somehow got screwed up once I press the "post & publish" button... The bad part though is that I really want to write that down... so I guess I might as well just start working on it... again... *sigh*

      too freaking tired... if someone walks by me and pushes me, even a little, I may fall... and probably faint on the way down...  yesterday stuart and martin arrived... so weird to see them again, and to joke with them on my kitchen... it's been over a year since we said "bye", and I'm truly happy to have them around. The problem is that I don't have the time, or the money, to do that much stuff with them... but we will see how everything goes!... Because of those two it will be a very interesting month!... ha ha ha.  so... i'm still too nervous when singing "solo"... sucks.  got a date with this girl for tomorrow... yay!!...  (everything is going good on that matter).

      Ahhh... fui a comer con tanya y la suegra... fue la onda!!...  La señora es muuuy buena gente y por lo visto ya me ha adoptado de manera oficial... he he he. Que buen plan, como que esta muy contenta de que tanya y yo estemos juntos.  Con tanya?... pues un rato vimos la tele en su casa y despues nos fuimos al cine.. la pelicula era muy mala y de horror, he he he, pero como a los dos nos daba miedo fue la onda!!!... (gran porcentaje del tiempo estuvimos abrazados!!)... he he he... "tipico"... Estuvo muy chido... y pues mas chido el cotorreo de "despues"... platicamos muy padre como dos horas ahi en pabellon sobre mil cosas... es bien chido platicar con alguien y que las horas pasen tan rapido... me recuerda mucho a las citas de "momo"... el tiempo es cosa chistosa, y definitivamente el corazon tiene mucho que ver en la manera en que se vive.  Ya mas tarde, cuando ibamos a su casa, en el carro se me ocurrio decirle: "oye tanya... no te he preguntado qeu si quieres ser mi novia!!... te gustaria ser mi novia?!"... ha ha ha... y lo chido fue su respuesta, he he he, con una sonrisota un "pues claro!"... ha ha ha... y buen cotorreo de regreso en el auto...  Oh si hermanos mios... soy feliz... no se cuanto tiempo vaya a durar esto... un dia, una semana, un año... no se. He aprendido a no crear demasiadas expectativas y a vivir el dia a dia... por lo pronto se que estoy muy feliz, me siento muy comoda con ella y espero que esto dure un buen rato... espero llegarla a conocer mas y mas y llenarme de recuerdos a su lado... espero que la vida nos mantenga juntos un rato y que, si yo solo "estoy de paso" por su vida, espero ser para ella un buen hombre y ayudarla a crecer en muchas cosas... asi como de seguro ella me hara crecer a mi... que fregon me siento por esta oportunidad que me ha puesto la vida en frente...

      "Fin de semana con tanya... un nuevo libro comienza a ser escrito"  Este fin de semana ha sido magico por muchas razones... todas ellas resumibles en una palabra: tanya...  Salimos tanya, victor, ireri y yo a jugar boliche y a un cafe, y ahi nos la pasamos chidisimo, buena convivencia, risas... en general un buen rato. Se me hace muy padre que tanya se lleve bien con ese par, mas que nada porque, por aquello de "los carros" y todo, pues es comun que salgamos junto con ellos... Parte memorable fue que en el cafe de nuevo nos "acurrucamos" un rato, y ella me daba de comer quesito en la boca... "ahhh que rico"... ha ha ha... en resumen, fue un dia "lindo" y muy divertido...   Lo mas interesante sucedio hoy domingo, dia en el que yo pensaba quedarme trabajando, y no pensaba verla a ella sino hasta el martes. (curioso como cambian los planes de uno). Estaba "trabajando" cuando ella se conecto en el msn y comenzamos a charlar... por "x" razones resulta que tanya estaba bastante triste, y pues eso la neta me aguito. Le ofreci el ir por ella y salir a caminar o algo para que se distrajera, y pues buen plan, me dijo que "si porfavor"!. Fui por ella alrededor de las 6, nos quedamos en su casa charlando como una hora con su mama, y luego fuimos a caminar a un parque.  El parque fue la onda porque caminamos mucho y platicamos de mil cosas... desde religion, brujeria, relaciones de pareja, los papas, amigos, etc... etc... etc... y nos sentamos a ver el atardecer muy rico en unas banquitas. Ahi fue donde le di la "monedita de corazon" (un "penny" que tiene un corazon grabado), y le dije que era para hacerla sonreir, y recordarle que era la onda, aun cuando ella se sintiera mal... he he he.   Nos regresamos a su casa antes de que anocheciera, porque asi lo indico su mama (ya que tanya se esta enfermando de la garganta), y pues como llegamos antes que su mama mejor nos pusimos a caminar, mas que nada porque no me latio que su mama nos encontrara "solos en la casa" y pensara mal... la señora confia mucho en mi, y quiero que eso asi continue. (cosa chida de la mama!, me comento tanya que dice que parezco muy buen muchacho, y que incluso me hizo "buena publicidad" con su papa!!). Cuando llego su mama nos pusimos a platicar de nuevo un poco con ella, y despues decidimos ver una pelicula... vimos la de "serving sara"... divertida. Estabamos muy acurrucaditos "apapachadores" mientras la veiamos, pero todo tranquilo...  Lo chido fue cuando termino la pelicula y comenzamos a ver "good will hunting"... hice un comentario sobre mi barba y el cotorreo nos llevo a estar de tal manera en la que estabamos abrazandonos completamente mientras veiamos la pelicula... ella me acariciaba un poco el codo y el brazo, y yo hacia lo mismo con ella... en ese punto creo que era obvio que ninguno de los dos estaba poniendo atencion a la pelicula.  En eso, voltee con ella y le di un "tierno beso" en la frente... ella respondio con una sonrisota muy chida... he he he. Un poquito despues, cuando de nuevo voltie hacia su rostro (que me quedaba sumamente cerca a mi izquierda), vi sus labios "muy de modo" y pues pense "inge su!", y le plante un beso...  Oh si hermanos mios!!... fue un buen beso y muy correspondido... y a ese le siguieron varios y pues todo muy rico de ahi en adelante... A eso de las 11:30, y cuando ya se estaba terminando la pelicula, como que me di cuenta de la necesidad de regresar a mi casa... no sin antes tener una charla chida con ella... nos dijimos muchisimas cosas, pero lo que mas me gustò fue cuando le dije: "muchas gracias tanya por permitirme entrar en tu vida"... y ella respondio "gracias a ti... llegaste en el momento indicado"...  Sip... ya tengo chava, y me encanta... me trae loco y pues wow... que chido!!!.... no se cuanto dure, no se como se vayan a dar las cosas, pero se que por lo pronto todo es chidisimo, y espero que asi siga por un buen rato!. Esta chava llego a mi vida por una razon, somos super parecidos en mil cosas, y empatizamos muy chido... ojala sea una relacion muy buena para los dos... vamos a tirarle a que asi sea.

      Bueno... el hecho de que Martin y Stuart esten aqui, y las buenas risas que he hechado gracias a ellos, ha sido definitivamente importante... sin embargo, lo mas importante para mi esta semana ha sido todo lo que ha pasado con tanya... y es que oh hermanos mios!, las cosas con ella no dejan de pasar!!...  La vì durante toda la semana... bueno, solo el viernes no... el viernes fue mi dia para extrañarla. Y vaya que las cosas son chidas con esta chava... en clases de canto y todo pues el cotorreo sigue como siempre, muy padre, pero lo chido fue cuando la ayude el martes con su tarea de flash, y cuando la invite a salir al teatro conmigo para el miercoles!!... Lo de flash fue padre, buen cotorreo, pero chido lo del miercoles!!!...  Desde que la vi llegar a clases ella se veia SUPER bien... con una mirada un poco dura y cansada, pero se veia muy bien... se fue asi de arreglada porque iba a salir conmigo esa noche!!... Mas adelante pude hablar con ella, e incluso darle un buen abrazo, y entendi un poco el porque traia esa mirada... se sentia muy cansada y agobiada por varias cosas de la escuela.  Entre los del coro la carrilla ya esta durisima hacia con nosotros... y el miercoles pasado fue muy cura porque, al parecer, tanya traia en el "pecho-cuello" una marca, con forma de "h"... obviamente eso fue el acabose!!... todo mundo se riò, y obviamente no pudieron dejar de hacer el comentario de que "hector" comienza con "h"... obviamente yo no tuve nada que ver con esa marca!, creanme que lo recordaria!!...  ;o)  Anyway... el miercoles en la tarde nos fuimos al cafe khattra, donde tuvimos un buen cotorreo con victor e ireri, y luego nos fuimos al teatro. La obra fue muy divertida, aunque obviamente yo traia otras ideas en la cabeza!!... mas aun cuando tanya decidio recargarse conmigo y poner su cabeza en mi hombro!!... HACE CUANTO NO ME PONIA TAN NERVIOSO!!!... me daban mil ganas de ponerle el brazo alrededor de sus hombros pero ah!!... que miedo y que pena!!... no me anime... he he he... fue de lo mas loco!... :oS   Pero bueno, lo pasamos chido y nos reimos... la obra fue buena. (hair spray, puesta en escena por el tec)  Lo mas padre sucedio el jueves... cuando tuve que ir por ella a las 6:30am a su casa para darle un "raid" al tec... el carro de su mama se averiò, y pues me pidió el paro... he he he. obviamente dije que si!... y ahi me tienen tempranito por ella. Llegue y charlamos un poco con su mama, y pues nos fuimos al tec... como llegamos alrededor de las 7, y las clases comienzan hasta las 7:30, pues tuvimos un buen rato para platicar. Se nos uniò annette (su amiga), y pues estuvo chido. Para esto quedamos de vernos a las 10:30 para seguir cotorreando, y mientras pensaba "hector, tienes clase a esa hora!", le respondi "claro!, ahi nos vemos!"... ha ha ha, como se nota que hay prioridades en la vida.  Ese cotorreo a las 10:30 estuvo chido, mas que nada porque nos pusimos a mensear y escribir "notas informativas" hacerca de un mundo de magia... (algo para una tarea de ella). Lo divertido fue que llego annette con nosotros, de nuevo, y pues se puso a platicar... en eso unos amigos de ellas comienzan a gritarle a annette y a escribirle a tanya que si queriamos que se llevaran a annette, porque hacia "mal tercio"... he he he... y fue de lo mas "incomodo y divertido"... sus amigos caminaban cual si fueran a la tienda y se nos quedaban viendo... en eso una amiga de tanya voltea, hace un guiño y me da los "thumbs up"... en dos ocasiones!!... ha ha ha... como me reì.  Poco mas tarde pues tanya se regreso a la prepa, y yo me puse a darle una asesoria a laura ortiz sobre su mac... le platique un poco sobre mi situacion con esta chava y laura estaba encantada y divertidisisisisima!, y me dijo: "mira, para la otra que se te recargue, tu ofrecele poner tu brazo alrededor de ella, te apuesto a que es lo que ella quiere!"... y pues, he he he... resulto ser un buen consejo!.  Ese jueves en la tarde pase por ella alrededor de las 4:30, resulta que cuando llegue estaba practicando canto en la sala, y pues su mama ahi encantada escuchandola!. Yo obviamente como bobo nomas viendola y oyendola... espero no haber traido la cara de tonto que bien pude haber puesto!!... ha ha ha, pero la verdad es que se veia muy bonita y canta super rico. Anyway, despues de ahi nos fuimos a su dentista... he he he, y ya que le arreglaron un diente decidimos ir al cine a ver "este cuerpo no es mio"...  Fuimos a la gran plaza, estacionamos el carro, y le caimos al cine. La pelicula estaba a punto de comenzar asi que apenas tuvimos tiempo de tomarnos una rica agua fresca, y despues le caimos a la movie. Escogimos buenos lugares y pues, comenzamos a ver la pelicula!!... Cabe mencionar que la pelicula es MUY MUY BUENA!!... y yo me estaba doblando de la risa y carcajeando cañon, los que me conocen saben a lo que me refieron con carcajadas!!... ha ha ha...  Lo padre durante la pelicula fue el hecho de que tanya y yo pues estabamos sentados "super pegaditos", e incluso en un momento que me hice para el otro lado como "con miedo de ella", esta chava me jalo y me puso de nuevo a su lado... Al poco rato de comenzada la pelicula tanya comenzo a comportarse como si tuviera algo de frio, y pues luego luego me acorde de los sabios consejos de laura ortiz... y le pregunte algo mas o menos asi: oye, tu crees que si pongo mi brazo alrededor de tus hombros te daria menos frio?... he he he, y pues asi fue!!!... y asi vimos el resto de la pelicula "acurrucaditos" bien rico!... :oP  Despues de eso fuimos a platicar a las banquitas... bueno, antes caminamos un poco... y pues esa charla fue muy chida, porque fue la primera platica en la que en realidad fuimos "intimos", y compartimos cosas mas personales y todo, fue una charla de lo mas rica, muy abierta y se sentia que ambos confiamos el uno en el otro... fue tan rica la platica que pasaron las horas sin que nos dieramos cuenta, y poco antes de las 11 decidimos regresar. Al llegar al auto nos dimos cuenta de un problema... yo habia dejado las luces prendidas!!!... (que wey!), y pues fue todo un show buscar ayuda, hablar a mi casa y todo... (a esa hora casi no habia nadie en la plaza, ni el estacionamiento). En eso encontramos un cuate que al parecer nos iba a ayudar, dijo que fueramos a nuestro auto y luego nos alcanzaba... lo mejor que podiamos hacer era confiar, asi que pues eso hicimos. El tipo se tardo como 20 minutos en regresar... que hicimos durante esos 20 minutos?!. Pues bueno, ademas de charlar, etc, sucedio algo similar a lo del cine de nuevo!... ;o)  Ella se recargo en el carro y yo "ni lento ni perezoso" decidi recargarme a su lado y poner mi brazo a su alrededor... fue un momento de lo mas rico, y neta que yo me moria por plantarle un beso!!!... ha ha ha, de hecho la ambientacion y todo eran de lo mas chidas (muy urbano), y aunque parecia el "momento ideal" obviamente no era, ya que en eso llego el compa que nos iba a ayudar... he he he... oh pues!, que mas da.  Llegando a casa de tanya le pedi disculpas por lo que paso con el auto, y por dejar las luces prendidas... su respuesta me encanto: "no, estubo bien!, de hecho para la otra dejalas prendidas de nuevo!". Obviamente los dos la pasamos rico "esperando la ayuda" ese dia.  despues llego el viernes, y pues el viernes no la vi... ese fue dia de relajo con los "brits" y cena en casa de lourdes.

      It's been almost a week since the last time I wrote on this things... and well... I hate (or love) to say that I have tons to write... Unfortunatelly I haven't been able to hang out a lot with the brits, on tuesday I showed them around the campus and such, but that was pretty much it until friday... friday was a fun day with them!!... we went to "downtown guadalajara" and had a blast... we were all over the place, la rotonda, la plaza de armas, palacio municipal, palacio de goberacion, museo cabañas, teatro degollado, san juan de dios... ALL OVER THE PLACE!!... I think I walked more this past friday, than what I have walked all through the year so far... ha ha ha... (well, I may be exagerating, but it certainly felt llike that). Then I took this guys to have some real tacos (in a decent place), we had some ice cream, and well... it was a fun day overall...  Walking with this guys is certainly fun, I think I laughed 80% of the time!!... and aswell I realized how "good" it is to go with foreings to walk downtown, since several times we were stoped and called by girls!!!... really!, this guys were like a "girl-magnet" and I really don't know why... I don't think they are good looking at all!!... ha ha ha... but well, it was fun, we even took some pics with some girls and all...  What else?... well, I worked a lot in school stuff this week, and friday night we had a party at "lourdes's" place, those are always nice... another big thing is the "tanya" thing... he he he, which was probably the "key issue" of the week... but I shall write about that later.  ;o)

      Ok... segundo intento del dia... Hoy en la mañana habia escrito mucho en esta cosa, bastante diria yo, cuando al presionar "post & publish" decidió joderse y valer quezadilla... TODO... todo lo que escribí valio para nada... y pues ya, se fue... obviamente en el momento me dio mucho coraje, por lo que deje de escribir y opte hacer algo mas productivo, como algo de tarea y esas tonterias... eso paso como a las 8 de la mañana y ahora, me encuentro, al fin un poco libre despues de tanta tarea... son las 7 de la tarde... 11 horas haciendo lo mismo!!!!... eso suena a mucho incluso para cosas "disfrutables"!!... es sumamente agotador... he he he... y yo creo que por lo mismo estoy divagando tanto...  Pues bueno... hare un intento de re-escribir lo que ya tenia listo en la mañana... solo que ahora es en español el rollo, en la mañana me pegó la locura de escribirlo en ingles.   Y pues qué ha pasado?... mucho!, y todo muy padre... la vida sigue pasando y yo me la he pasado viviendola, eso de que la vida pase sin que uno se entere no es buena inversión!. La escuela se esta poniendo muy muy pesada, chamba, tengo muchisimo trabajo del cite y las negociaciones con posibles sociedades no dejan de absorver tiempo... todo es chido, pero ya la verdad como me gustaria no tener que preocuparme por la escuela. Ultimamente siento que, definitivamente, es una perdida de tiempo.  El rollo de la cantaba va muy chido, y sigue siendo muy divertido... los ensayos cada vez se ponen mas intensos, con eso de que estamos ya muy cerca de la fecha, y creo que se nota que todos nos estamos poniendo un poco nerviosos al respecto, pero todo es bueno... ha de salir. En la camerata cotorreo mucho con aldo, (ya belen nos puso "beto y enrique") y la verdad es que eso me hace reir un buen. Por otro lado la clase es chida y la obra de chava flores ya esta tomando mas forma!!... El otro dia nos fuimos ya con vestuario y todo!. (por cierto, tanya traia un traje de gitana que se le veia muy bien!!...).  Y pues la vida con tanya sigue padre... despues de las platicas con su mama y papa creo que su mama se siente mas tranquila con que tanya y yo salgamos, e incluso el otro dia nos dejo solos un ratito en su casa.. que chido!!... :oD  Estuve viendo a tanya diario por los ensayos y todo, y eso nos daba ratitos para nosotros, pero lo mas padre fue el jueves y ayer (viernes) cuando tuvimos de nuevo la oportunidad de salir juntos y pasar un rato fuera del tec!. De cualquier manera en la semana le estuve hablando por telefono y eso es muy chido, el msn es padre, pero escuchar la voz de alguien es la onda... incluso cuando fui el martes con hector al centro magno no pude aguantarme las ganas de salir de la pelicula para hablarle y desearle buenas noches!!... :oP  Y pues bueno, el jueves fuimos por tanya como a las 3, luego por ireri, y nos le caimos al centro magno... (ahorita pabellon es una pesadilla con eso de la construccion del "nodo vial"). Semi-cotorreamos, acompañamos a ireri a comer, salude a un par de amigos que hace mucho tiempo no veia (sergio y el peter), y entramos a ver X-MEN 2... wow!... que fregoneria de pelicula!!!... lo chido fue que entramos a una "megapantalla" con sonido THX... hijos... no voy a decir mucho por si alguno de ustedes "lectores" no la ha visto, pero wow... es la onda!. (wolverine es un fregon... punto).  Despues del cine fuimos al Rojo Cafe, y pasamos un rato agradable... estoy comenzando a desarrollar la teoria de que victor e ireri en verdad estan locos!!... pero son un par de monos muy divertidos, hacen reir mucho a tanya y eso me gusta... tanya se ve muy chida cuando se rie, tiene ese tipo de sonrisa muy amplia y sincera que le ilumina toda la cara de manera poca madre!!... ahhh... ya voy a comenzar a divagar pensando en ella!!... ha ha ha... que loco!!... pero bueno, me gusta!...  Anyway... despues del cafe fuimos a casa de tanya a dejarla, y despues hicimos lo mismo con ireri... victor y yo nos regresamos, bla bla bla...  El viernes fue poca madre, fui con tanya a comer (a su casa) y wow!!... wOW... WOW!!... que rico cocina esa mujer!, y eso hoy en dia es como un tesorote, la mayoria de las chavas no tienen la menor idea de lo que es cocinar, ni les interesa tener la menor idea... he he he... que suertudo soy!... hubo unos camarones deliciosos, pescado, un arrocito, buen vino... unos platanos rellenos de frijoles que sabian suuuuper bien!!.... (y si, ya se que es muy loco el concepto), y pues la platica de sobremesa estuvo rica. Despues de la comida la mama de tanya fue a comprar un sistema de aire acondicionado, y ahi es cuando nos dejo solos un ratito... se me hizo muy chido!!... mas que nada porque asi poco a poco la mama confia mas en nosotros... yipiee!!... Mientras su mama no estaba nos pusimos a lavar los platos, arreglar la cocina, y ver un rato la tele... (ja!).  Ya despues cuando llego la señora le ayudamos a instalar el rollo ese, y decidimos juntos ver la pelicula de "a walk to remember"... (gracias erik!)... bonita movie... creo que soy demasiado sensible ya que ninguna de ellas (mujeres) lloró!!... pero bueno... he he he... viviré con eso. Despues de la movie fuimos al buen cafe khatra con victor e ireri, y de nuevo la pasamos chido... (bueno, yo la pase chido!... ojala los demas no hayan estado terriblemente aburridos, incluyendo a tanya!)... mas que nada menseamos mucho!... eso es muy sano de vez en cuando. Ah si!!... en ese trayecto de casa de tanya al cafe y de regreso, nos fuimos en el carro de tanya, y ella manejo "a su estilo"... he he he... nomas con decirles que victor estaba muuuuy nervioso!.  Eventualmente regresamos cada quien a su casa, (victor y yo nos regresamos despues de que victor asusto terriblemente a la pobre de jaquie!! - la perrita de tanya), y pues ahi, no pude evitar el ponerme a trabajar... ahh... que flojera. Es muy dificil ponerse a hacer tarea cuando su hermano esta jugando el nuevo zelda ahi afuera!!!... (malditas tentaciones)... Mmm... que mas?... si!, algo interesante de anoche fue que le pase la direccion de esta cosa (blog) a tanya!. Asi que probablemente ella este leyendo esto!!!...  Fue muy cura e interesante... me senti tal vez un poco nervioso, pero un amigo me hizo recordar el gesto de un chavo cuando le regala su diario a la niña que le gusta... (en un libro que, si no conocen, entendería perfectamente), y es un gesto poca madre... es el hecho de abrirle completamente su corazon y mente a alguien y regalarselo... no tengo nada que ocultarle a tanya y sí todo para compartirle... que mejor manera?... que mejor manera que el hecho de que pueda leer acerca de mi vida y como, mil eventos, me llevaron hasta ella?... y como es todo ahora... Es divertido porque la direccion se la he pasado a amigos y "x"... no hay pex... con tanya senti como abrirle las puertas a mi todo!!... como que permitirme ser completamente vulnerable ante ella... pero se sintio bien, y padre... y me da mucho gusto. Vaya, no se si lo vaya a leer... (no se si estes leyendo esto chica!), pero lo chido es que ya tiene esa posibilidad, y es una manera mas de que pueda conocerme!!!... eso es chido!... ;o)  Hoy... hoy no ha pasado nada interesante.... mucho trabajo solamente, todo el dia en el CITE haciendo mi proyecto de redes3, y pues aqui sigo... creo que es momento de darle "post & publish", esperar que todo salga bien, y prepararnos para hacer una llamada muy importante. :oD

      Esta semana pasada, aunque no sali con tanya, si la vi mucho en el tec y convivi mucho con ella... mucho de charlas y platicas chidas... fue muy fregon... mas porque siento que cada vez nos conocemos mas y confiamos mas el uno en el otro... incluso tuve la "oportunidad" de estar ahi cuando necesitaba un hombro para apoyarse mientras lloraba... nunca es padre ver a alguien a quien quieres triste, pero siempre es padre sentir que puedes estar ahi para ellos y darles un abrazo... creo que tanya aprecio mi compañia, y yo aprecié mucho su confianza y que se haya sentido comoda conmigo de esa manera...  Si antes, en el fin de semana que no la vi por estar trabajando, me di cuenta de lo chido que era para mi ESTAR con ella, ahora me di cuenta de lo chido que es COMPARTIR con ella... y el hecho de que todo lo que hice este fin de semana, cosas muy padres, hubiera sido mucho mas chido si ella hubiese estado ahi... no podia dejar de pensar en ella y desear poder compartir esas cosas, y la neta es que eso es poca madre... es cursi, pero un poco como la cancion de "te comence por extrañar, pero empecé a necesitarte luego".... yo creo que despues de todo eso es enamorarse, el hecho de sentir que, cuando no estas con ella, quisieras estarlo...   Ayer ya casi todo mundo en clase se dio cuenta de que "andamos" y fue muy cotorro (con eso de que le regale flores a tanya todo mundo le preguntaba que quién se las habia dado!)... mucha carrilla a ambos y muchas risitas de las chavitas, felicitaciones y todas esas cosas... en la cameratta fue aun mas divertido, mas porque Belen hizo el anuncio oficial y luego se pusieron todos a pedirnos "beso-beso" y he he he... fue muy cura todo... pero en general todos estan asi en plan de "que lindo" y bla bla bla... Estoy contento con la relacion, ahora si que solo espero que su mama nos vaya dando confianza poco a poco, para que en cuanto a permisos y eso no tengamos tantas broncas!!... :oP  Por lo pronto estoy viendo el monito que me regalo tanya que dice "no me canso de decirte que TE QUIERO" y no puedo dejar de sonreir... :o)

      La Semana despues de la Santa  Durisimo regreso a la realidad... semana santa fue como una burbujita perfecta de cero trabajo, cero escuela, y mucha diversion muy padre... pero ahh... tenia que terminar. Fue una semana particularmente dificil por varias razones, 1) los ingleses, 2) rollo con tanya, 3) demasiado trabajo...  1) El hecho de tener a los ingleses en guadalajara ha sido muy divertido... de verdad que me la he pasado muy bien con ellos, he salido mucho y vivido buenas risas... pero ha sido muy muy desgastante. Desde el lunes en la noche que me junte con ellos ha sido todo un show!!... pero chido. Ese lunes por ejemplo nos juntamos en el hippos y me platicaron todas sus chocoaventuras en acapulco, me enseñaron fotos y la neta yo no dejaba de reirme... ademas de que hicieron cosas muy curas y divertidas, la manera en la que las narran es muy muy comica!!!... Despues sali con ellos el miercoles, y terminamos viendo unos dvd's en su casa muy divertidos, de una serie que se llama "father ted", irlandesa, curadisma!!!... un humor muy fregon, muy tonto, pero bueno. Despues ya los vi hasta el viernes, y ahi es donde comenzo la macro friega!!!... se quedaron a mi casa de viernes a domingo y wow... definitivamente no estoy hecho para esa vida nocturna... El viernes por ejemplo fuimos a un bar, y despues a la marcha a bailar; el sabado fuimos hasta el pueblo de tequila, caminamos muchisimo, conocimos la fabrica de jose cuervo, etc... esa noche fuimos al pancho reatas a cotorrear como hasta las 3 - 4 de la mañana... y el domingo igual de en friega... solo que ese dia en la noche ya no los acompañe porque fueron al "kaoz" y la neta, si antes no me latia, ahora con chava menos... claro que fue un fin de semana poca madre, y lo mas chido es que nos quedamos con muchas fotos para avalarlo... pero la neta me dejo exhausto!!!... maneje muchisimo por todos lados (hasta tequila!), y dormi muy muy poco... pero bueno, la verdad casi no habia convivido con estos chavos y se lo merecian... Ya ayer (lunes) los fui a llevar al aeropuerto, y quien sabe cuando los vaya a ver de nuevo.  2) Bueno... pues la semana con tanya fue chida, calmada pero chida... solo nos pudimos ver en el tec, ambos andamos en friega en examenes y todo!!... pero tambien el rollo fue "la platica" con su mama. Como que su mama no sentia tanta confianza de que salieramos y eso hasta antes de tener una charla conmigo... (gulp!), y pues asi fue... Durante la semana el cotorreo fue de vernos entre clases, durante el coro, en la cameratta y eso (de hecho un dia le ayude a estudiar mate!... espero que no la haya confundido, he he he, pero si hasta eso que me puse a estudiar su temaria e hice un resumen y todo!)... y pues llego el jueves y el dia de la platica con su mama!... ese jueves fui a su casa y tuvimos una platica muy "x" los tres en la sala, hasta que derrepente la mama dijo "tanya, porque no te vas a estudiar?"... y ta-ta-ta-taaan... me quede solo con su mama en la cocina y tuvimos "la charla"... La verdad es que yo estaba muy nervioso y no sabia ni que me iba a decir!!!... pero no fue tan malo despues de todo, y pues la mama expreso sus preocupaciones (como cualquier mama) y me pidio, basicamente, que tratara a su hija como se debe y tengamos una buena relacion... chido!!... :oP  3) ahh!!... demasiadas cosas que hacer en la escuela y en el trabajo!!!!... que triste!!!....  Pero bueno... la semana fue chida, y termino muy bien... termino basicamente el domingo con una reunion que tuve con el papa de tanya... si es que estaba un poco nervioso el jueves con su mama, el domingo estaba NERVIOSISISIMO conociendo a su papa!!!... la verdad es que tanto tanya como su mama me habian dicho tantas cosas que yo ya pensaba que el señor me iba a matar, pero la verdad es que fue muy padre, se ve que es un señor muy buena gente, platicamos mucho y basicamente lo que me pidio fue que tratara bien a su hija y que pues fueramos responsables... ahh... entre a su casa muy nervioso y sali sintiendome muy bien!!... Lo que estoy viviendo por esta niña!!!... que loco... pero es chido, y la verdad es que la quiero, me quiere, y vamos agusto...

      Vaya vaya... hace ya como dos semanas que no escribo en esta cosa...  Los factores "chava", "clases" y "visita de los ingleses" han sido definitivamente muy muy dañinos para este blog. :oP   Y lo mas "malo" es que si han pasado muchas cosas que contar... no es sano esto de no escribir seguido, mas que nada porque luego se le olvidan a uno las cosas, o como ya no las siente igual, no se escriben de la misma manera... el 80% de la existencia de este blog es que es un diario, un lugar para yo sentarme a recordar... y si sigo asi va a dejar de ser buena inversion... que mal, que mal...  Semana santa fue muy buena, con los ingleses en acapulco tuve mucho tiempo para dedicarselo a tanya. En realidad le dedique mas de lo debido ya que no hice NADA de lo que pensaba hacer en esa semana!!!... mi lista de "to-do's" no se disminuyo.. aunque bueno, "hacerme de una novia" no estaba en la lista, asi que cuando eso paso vino a borrar todas las otras prioridades. Como operaron a la mama de tanya el martes, pues no estuvimos saliendo mucho, mas bien el rollo fue cotorreo en su casa!. Ese mismo martes fui con "ellas" y les lleve un globo a cada una, a su mama uno de "get well soon" y a tanya uno aca, "chido"... aun no me sentia comodo comprandole un globo de "te quiero" o algo asi... se me hacia pronto, y mas bien no queria comenzar con esos rollos de manera precipitada!!... (que complicado es todo esto!)... pero fue chido...  El miercoles no pensaba poder verla, ya que me junte toooodo el dia con el equipo de "et" a trabajar y pues :oS... se complicaban las cosas. Ademas no teniamos un carro en la casa y eso de quedarnos con solo un carro para la familia, viviendo hasta las cañadas, en realidad causa conflictos. Sin embargo chateando leve con tanya me di cuenta de que TENIA que ir... mas que nada porque escribio "bueno, ya me voy a bañar y arreglar para estar lista al rato que vengas"... he he he... que manipulables somos. :oP   De cualquier manera fue muy chido ir... he he he, se veia suuuper bien!!!... jugamos un poco damas chinas con su mama en la cocina, pero ya despues nos quedamos solos viendo la tele... y pues si, estuvo chido. Ahi fue un momento en realidad poca madre, mas que nada porque ella me dijo "hector, te quiero"... y yo casi me deshago de la ternura... que padre... Eso marco una pauta chida en la relacion. Poco mas tarde fue mi papa por mi a su casa y pues ya... fue un buen dia. Probablemente mejor que el jueves... :oS   El jueves fue muy chido de hecho, le ayude a hacer un proyecto de flash y luego platicamos muy chido en su terraza... lo "malo" es que en cierto momento su mama nos vio abrazados y "toma!"... fue un duro shock para la mama... lo cual marco el comienzo de toda una saga que ire mencionando poco a poco!!...  El rollo es que para cualquier motivo oficial yo soy el primer novio de tanya, y eso es todo un evento para sus papas claro... y la señora claro de que esta un poco preocupada y quiere asegurarse de que no vayamos a hacer "cosas" que no... lo cual se me hace muy valido. Anyway, la semana termino muy chido!!... el viernes vi a tanya y fuimos un ratito a caminar al centro magno y a tomar algo en un cafe... fue poquito tiempo porque despues le hablo su mama pidiendo que regresaramos, y ya en su casa estuvimos un ratote viendo albums de fotos... he he he... me toco vivir la vida de tanya a traves de sus fotos y la verdad es que fue muy divertido!!...  Ese fin de semana no vi a tanya... me la pase "enclaustrado" trabajando... y wow... no manches, la extrañe muchisimo!!... No podia dejar de pensar en ella y la verdad es que fue chido... fue feo el hecho de no haberla visto ni salir, pero fue padre porque me dio tiempo de extrañarla, y darme cuenta de que en realidad se ha convertido en una parte importante en mi vida, y que disfruto mucho cuando estoy con ella. Ella vivio algo similar y dice que no podia dejar de pensar en mi... he he he... que padre!!... :oP

      El mayor problema justo ahora es que me estoy quedando dormido... anoche dormi como 4 horas, nos es sumamente poco pero tampoco es suficiente, y hoy, como llegamos al tec desde las 6:45am, decidí tirarme al suelo a descansar un poco... "dormi" como una hora, pero probablemente fue contraproducente!... ahora sí me siento con mucho sueño, y tengo la nariz tapada... (malditas alergias... maldita alfombra)... pero qué mas da... esperemos que un cafe-cite pueda ayudarnos a salir de esta.  Que ha pasado interesante?, pues bueno, el dia de ayer fue de lo mas interesante en general... fue algo asi como "parents meet the parents"!!, y creo que fue "prueba superada"... En la mañana le hable a tanya para definir los planes del dia, y asi de manera medio casual surgió la idea de "juntar a los papas"!!... (fue idea de tanya, buena!). Y pues asi fue, fui con la familia de tanya a jugar boliche un rato y después nos fuimos todos a comer a la hosteria del angel. El boliche fue la onda, muy muy divertido y creo que aprendí bastante... jugamos 2 juegos... perdi los dos!!!!... ha ha ha, pero es que ellos en realidad sí saben lo que hacen... en el primer juego el señor tuvo como 175 puntos!!... (ehem... yo como 60... ha ha ha). Lo pasamos chido y fue una oportunidad padre de convivir con el papa de tanya, es un señor amable y agradable, y creo que no le caigo tan mal... :o)  Después nos fuimos todos a comer, llegamos con la familia de tanya como a las 2:10 y acababan de llegar mis papas... la comida estuvo rica (desde mi punto de vista), y la platica de sobremesa fue muy padre. De hecho "los papas" platicaron muchísimo de cosas que encontraban en común de tepa y eso, las mamas platicaron chido, victor, ireri, tanya... en general pasamos un rato agradable charlando. Creo que el principal objetivo de la comida era que se conocieran las familias, así ambas ahora saben un poquito mas de la otra persona, y puede que se sientan mas cómodos con la idea de que tanya y yo seamos novios... como que se conocen las familias, se cotorrea y todo, y así se van dando cuenta de que "somos buenos muchachos"... he he he.   En la tarde regresamos a casa de tanya, ya que habia dejado ahi el carro, y nos pusimos a ver la pelicula de "red dragon"... (primero fuimos a rentarla y todo, claro).... muy buena pelicula!. No la habia visto... hijos... que gente tan enferma, estan cañones los asesinos en serie y todo ese tipo de thirllers.. :oS No esta taaan enfocada en el Dr. Hannibal Lecter (a. hopkins), sino en otro compa que se conoce como "tooth fairy"... la trama es la onda. Lo malo fue que, terminando la pelicula, pues tuve que regresar a mi casita y ya no pude cotorrear con tanya... pero es que tenia muchisima tarea y pues bueno... eso, aunuqe no se antoje, tambien hay que hacerlo...  Hoy?... esperemos que sea un buen dia... :oD

      El Hector y la cantadera...  Me duelen las plantas de los pies... de esos dolores desgantantes que no le permiten a uno disfrutar el hecho de estar de pie, o incluso caminando... me molesta la espalda... me es dificil mantener lo ojos abiertos, tengo muy poca lucidez, y mi cerebro va brincando de una idea a otra sin cesar... pero me siento suuumamente satisfecho y feliz... solo que porfavor recuerdenme no incluir esas primeras lineas en mi curriculum si algún día pido trabajo en una empresa!!...  Trone cisco 4... que hueva me da... no manchen, todo me da flojera ahorita y eso es muy muy malo porque tengo muchiiiiiisimo que hacer para mañana, aventarme toda la presentacion final de "et" en flash, bla bla bla... he he he, pero bueno. Ahorita es mi momento de flojera y de "sacar" los rollos y quejarme, asi que dejenme hacerlo en paz...   Lo mas raro es que no tengo nada de que quejarme, mas que de el hecho de que me siento tan cansado, y de que a tanya la castigo su mama y no pudimos salir hoy... esto ultimo no me molesta en realidad tanto, quiero compartir tiempo con ella, tiempo de calidad, y pues si ambos andamos en friega y debemos de dejar nuestra cita de "mes-aversario" para mas adelante lo entiendo... mas bien me entristece la actitud de la mama de tanya para con ella, no creo que sea justo, y me siento muy impotente al respecto. Creo que yo solo puedo quererla mucho y tratar de ser un apoyo en su vida... espero en verdad, que salga bien de esta y tantas criticas y presiones no le afecten tanto como podrian hacerlo... que duro... en realidad la quiero y me preocupo por ella, y se me hace muy gacho sentirme tan impotente en una situacion asi. Sin embargo, qué puedo hacer?... no voy a darle clases a la señora de cómo educar a su hija, o de que la riega en "x" y "x"... insisto... mi papel y mi compromiso es para con tanya, quererla bien y tratar de ser motivo de sonrisas en su vida... punto.  Punto interesante de la semana ha sido mi debut como cantante!... el cual sucedió el lunes en la peña cuicacalli... Mmmm... que rico comí ese dia!!!... tanya me invito a comer a su casa y como siempre, su mama se lució, un salmon delicioso, pasta wow, ensalada... rico-rico-rico!... he he he... despues de comer nos fuimos a la peña y llegamos ahi como a las 3, el "chow" era hasta las 8:30 así que yo juraba que ibamos a tener tiempo libre para cotorrear, incluso que iba tener tiempo para jugar magic con el tomas... nada... quien iba a pensar que en el momento de dirigir y montar la obra belen se iba a convertir en semejante director tan duro y demandante!!!... no nos dejo en paz y pues si... fue cansadisimo!!!... pero a la hora del espectaculo todo salio muy padre!.  En un momento me tocaba cantar un solo, derrepente quedaba yo solo en el escenario con todas las chavas y mientras cantaba todas se me tiraban encima y comenzaban a "tocarme" y cotorrear, intentanto seducirme y rollos asi... he he he... es una escena muy divertida, la neta yo siempre me "chiviaba" mucho y me reia... sin embargo yo tenia que tener actitud de "serio, galan, no las pelo"... y en los ensayos NUNCA pude, siempre que lograba contenerme se les ocurria algo nuevo para hacerme reir... (como el mismo lunes que salieron con eso de jalarme de las mejillas y eso). Sin embargo a la hora de la hora, aunque me estaba muriendo de miedo, salio todo bien!!!... he he he, y pues fue muy chido...  Los sketches, las canciones, incluso la bailada... todo salio muy bien... nos fuimos a dirvertir ahi arriba del escenario y se noto... que experiencia tan poca madre, fue muy cotorra la convivencia con todos los que participamos. En el camerino era pura carrilla y rollos asi. Y obviamente ahi estaba tanya lo cual le daba un toque aun mas chido al rollo!... ha ha ha... y ahora que no estaba belen viendonos todo el tiempo ya nos permitiamos darnos un abrazo o un besillo de vez en cuando!... he he he... (pero no le digan a belen!).  Terminando el show ahora si que "ahi se rompio una taza y cada quien para su casa"... hubo un poco de abrazos al final, felicitaciones y todas esas cosas que siempre hay y debe de haber... muy chido la verdad, muy buena vibra en el ambiente. Lo que fue muy padre es que me tope con un amigo que se llama "emanuel ballardo" que no veia desde hace años!!... ibamos juntos en la secundaria y wow, fue bien chido saludarlo... el compa se acerco a felicitarme y saludarme al final y el cotorreo y las sonrisas fueron muy sinceras. Me dio mucho gusto volver a verlo...  Esa noche llegue a mi casa con ganas de trabajar.. hacer tarea y todas esas cosas... pero en lugar de eso llegue y me cai muerto en la cama hasta el dia siguiente... decision que tendra repercusiones interesantes en lo academico, pero bueno, era necesario, simplemente no podia trabajar. Eso de cantar es mas cansado de lo que imaginaba!. Y aunque yo estaba muy muy cansado, ni siquiera me imaginaba lo que iba a suceder el dia siguiente... la presentacion del gloria de vivaldi!...  gloria--- gloria--- gloria___ gloria___ in exelsis deeeeeo!!...  la presentacion estuvo padrisisisisima!!!!... ME ENCANTO... wow... ahora si, de aqui para arriba... igual y salio por los codos y todo, pero el hecho de animarme a cantar un solo de opera enfrente de un publico, acompañado de musicos de la filarmonica... esta cañon... nomas por eso valio la pena tanta friega!. Pero bueno... me adelante ya mucho. El martes me fui con kike a comer y eso para caerle juntos a la iglesia... lourdes (su mama) nos trajo para arriba y para abajo a lo loco y bien chida, he he he... fuimos por los fraks, a cotarle el cabello a kike, a comer, todo!!... y llegamos a tiempo... he he he.  Ya en el templo nos pusimos a ensayar un rato, y yo estaba sumamente estresado y preocupado!. Tanya no llegaba!!... :oS, y belen nomas me volteaba a ver a mi... que duro... en realidad temia que la fuera a querer sacar de ultimo minuto o algo asi... pero en eso, llego!... pude respirar al fin!!. neta... pero bueno, continuo el ensayo y si hasta eso que estuvo muy bueno. Despues belen nos dio tiempo para relajarnos, cambiarnos y todo... Yo me separe del grupo y me puse a meditar en uno de los jardines... hace tiempo que no hacía eso!, que bien se siente... en eso, teniendo un momento "de silencio" y pensando chido llego Juan Vila y comenzó a hacerme platica... fue chido de hecho, casi no platico con él y es un buen tipo... le comente de tanya, de cómo estaba mi vida, etc... el compa cotorreo buen plan conmigo un ratote...  En eso ya decidí unirme al grupo y me fui con la bola, ahi nos pusimos a estirar, cotorrear y pasar un rato de "relacs" antes del show... tanya llego con una sorpresa de un ratoncito bien chido de esos de "te quiero" y todo y yo no manchen... me puse super "cursi-sentimental"!!... fue demasiado obvio para mi el como me afecto ese detallito de su parte... ahhh.... que chido. Y no manchen, se veia WOW con ese vestido, el peinado, ese maquillaje... hiiijos... muy linda, muy linda.  Y en eso, entre el cotorreo, los nervios, el peinarnos y vestirnos, etc... llego la temida hora y toma!!... derrepente ahi estabamos cantando enfrente de todo mundo!. Todos nosotros super formales, de frak los hombres y vestido largo negro las chavas, con pose muy seria y dandole con todo, acompañados de los musicos de la filarmonica... el evento fue poca madre, los solos, todo salio muy muy bien!. Era dificil para mi no sonreir cuando veia gente conocida en las "gradas", y todo paso "smooth"... lo cura fue cuando me toco pasar a cantar solo... QUE NERVIOS!!!.... tenia muchisimo miedo de no entrar bien, de quedarme callado... mil cosas... pero a la hora de la hora, en el momento indicado la voz salio como debía salir!. Muy probablemente sono super mal (aunque la gente dice que les gusto), pero lo que si se es que, si ya me pude parar enfrente de un publico a cantar una aria de opera, ya no hay ninguna que me vaya a intimidar!!!....  Y pues asi termino el concierto, todos muy felices y con muchos aplausos. Ya nos estabamos yendo cuando entramos de nuevo, y de despedida cantamos el "va pensiero" de verdi... de la obra de nabuco... la gente se emociono muchisimo!... Mi mama lloro... he he he... fue muy cura. (mas considerando que yo estaba como improvisando un 50% de las lineas, esa cancion solo la ensayamos como 3 veces!).  Cuando el concierto terminó sucedió la obligada sesión de abrazos y felicitaciones, poca madre, y ahi vi a mucha gente querida dandome buenos abrazos... y a muchos desconocidos tambien, lo cual siempre es desconcertante pero chido. :oD Despues de todo ese show, de cotorrear con el erik, allan y varios compas, pues llego la hora de irnos todos a un brindis, y ahi en casa de "eli" nos juntamos todos a comer algo y a brindar por lo que habíamos logrado esa noche. El brindis fue divertido, buen cotorreo... he he he, ahi la mama de tanya estaba grabando video, y en eso qeu nos comienza a grabar a nosotros y comienza con un "beso, beso!"... QUE PENA!!!!... pero bueno... un besito... he he he...   A las 12 de la noche tanya me pidió que la acompañara lejos de todo mundo, y me regaló un cd con un poema... ERA LA HORA DE NUESTRO MONTHAVERSARY!!... ha ha ha... que chidisimo, yo estaba super enternecido.... wow de mujer. Y ella se nota que si me quiere un buen y eso es un sentimiento poca madre!, oh si hermanos mios!!!... triste que yo no llebaba nada para ella esa noche... (pensaba darle algo al dia siguiente)... pero bueno. Mas o menos a esa hora todo mundo decidió regresar a su casa (incluyendo mi familia), y pues así terminó esa velada... con un buen abrazo para tanya y la promesa de irnos a comer al dia siguiente celebrando nuestro primer mes...  Lo triste fue cuando, mas tarde en la noche, recibí una llamada de tanya diciendome que no iba a poder hacer nada conmigo al día siguiente... tanya estaba sumamente triste y por lo visto había tenido alguna bronca con su mamá, y su mamá decidió castigarla prohibiéndole que salieramos a festejar nuestro mes... en el momento no me dio corage, estaba muy triste, mas que nada porque tanya estaba tan triste, y solo quería poder darle un abrazo para hacerla sentir bien. Estaba tan sacada de onda la pobre!!...  Pero bueno... así terminó la saga del debut como cantantes de varios de nosotros... con una pequeña nota triste, pero todo en general fue un buen allegro!.

      Estoy encontrando un patron... creo que este blog sera actualizado una vez a la semana, los lunes. Ahi es cuando, al parecer, encuentro tiempo para al final sentarme a escribir!.   La semana pasada fue muy buena, pero muuuuy cansadisima... de hecho creo que todas las semanas han sido ultimamente cansadas... que triste. Lo curioso es que no dejo de pensar que esta es la ultima recta DE LA CARRERA.... esta por ejemplo va a ser una semana muy muy pesada, entrego todos mis proyectos, presento una obra de teatro, una opera, bla bla bla... pero tambien va a ser LA ULTIMA semana de mi carrera como estudiante!!!... (siempre y cuando todo salga bien, claro)... la ultima... wow.  El lunes de la semana pasada fue chido porque fue el cumpleaños del buen gabo, y ahi pude verlo a el y a muchos compas con los que no cotorreaba desde hace un buen rato. Nos fuimos al sirloin en la noche y fueron risas muy muy chidas... Lo padre es que tambien fue tanya, y ademas de que pude presentarla, ella pudo conocer a varios de mis amigos y el tipo de ambiente en el que me muevo... he he he, estos chavos estaban geekeando cañon, albureando y simplemente siendo tontos!, (como yo acostumbro ser tambien), y fue muy cura que todos nos reiamos cañon, incluyendo tanya, y pues la neta pasamos un buen rato. Tuve que llevar a tanya temprano a su casa, pero yo despues regrese para seguir cotorreando con ellos hasta que todos se fueron.   El resto de la semana fue simplemente muy cansado la verdad... estuvimos ensayando practicamente diario para la cameratta y lo de chava flores, y wow... nunca me hubiera imaginado que cantar cansaba tanto. Eso de cantar mas de cuatro horas en un dia en realidad lo deja a uno todo debil, y curiosamente se siente como si uno hiciera abdominales (con eso de apoyar la voz, y respirar como se debe, bla bla bla). Pero cada vez iba sonando mejor. El martes por ejemplo ya ensayamos con los musicos de la filarmonica... wow... sonaban poca madre. Lo triste es que nos "comian", y teniamos que cantar durisisisisimo para medio sonar... a ver como resolvemos eso.   El cotorreo con tanya fue, desgraciadamente muy leve... algunas llamadas por telefono, ciertos momentos muy ricos en el tec, pero ahhh... como la extrañé. Y los mas duro es que nos veíamos diario, pero "de lejos", lo cual hacia las cosas mas dificiles. Pasamos horas al dia juntos ensayando, pero en los ensayos tenemos que comportarnos X el uno con el otro... y pues bueno, por diciplina y por todo lo haciamos, pero es bien dificil no poderle dar un abrazo, un beso... o cotorrear chido con ella. Lo padre es que tuvimos nuestras horas libres, ratitos en los que nos ibamos caminar, nos veiamos y platicabamos... La pobre se lastimo mucho su muñeca izquierda un dia y yo estaba bien preocupado!... luego le regale un collarcito con aretes el viernes creo, pero lo padre es que los "escondi" en un huevito kinder, y se sorprendio muchisimo cuando, al fin, se le ocurrio ver el jugete que iba a salir!. (le gusto muchisimo... esa sonrisa, y ese abrazo hace que todo valga la pena!).  Y asi poco a poco llego el sabado... 10 de mayo, "dia de las madres"... me la pase trabajando en el tec!... desde las 8am hasta despues de las 12 de la noche... fue muy triste, enfadoso y cansado, pero bueno, nos urgia sacar ese proyecto adelante... lo bueno es que todos nos dimos un "break" a la hora de la comida para ir con nuestras respectivas mamas. Hubo una comida con tios, tias y todo el show, y pues cotorrie un rato chido con mis primas... les conte de tanya y todo, fue un rato curado. Despues regrese al tec y a seguir trabajando...  Padre el domingo... bueno, casi todo el domingo... lo malo fue que tuve que estar en el tec a las 8am (de nuevo) para verme con mi equipo de 8 a 10 y afinar detalles del proyecto... pero bueno, eso no hubiera sido tan malo!... lo que fue verdaderamente malo es que mis compañeros de equipo NO LLEGARON!!... o sea, que pude haber dormido dos horas mas y ser muuy feliz.. pero bueno... asi es esto. Como a las 10:15 fui a casa de marisol, junto con aldo que vive en residencias, y ensayamos toda la mañana. Fue un ensayo divertido, y la verdad es que ya nos salieron bastante bien la mayoria de los numeros!. Despues hubo comida, yipiee!!!... y al final, a descansar un rato a mi casa... que rico... un par de horas de sueño fueron la onda. En la tarde fui a casa de tanya donde, al fin, pudimos pasar un ratote rico juntos sin preocuparnos por nada... primero la ayude a filmar un video que va a usar en una de sus clases, y ya despues nos la pasamos bien chido... bailamos mucho!!... eso fue la onda, nos pusimos a bailar merengue, salsa, y hasta banda!!... ha ha ha, ahi en su sala ella puso musica y bailamos un buen rato... ya despues que andabamos menseando mucho y algo cansadones, ya le caimos al sillon a ver la tele... tanya se quedo dormida un rato recargada en mi... fue muy rico. Me hacia mucha falta un rato asi... estaba muy muy cansado, la verdad toda la logica hubiera dicho que no fuera a su casa y me quedara tirado durmiendo en la mia, pero fue MUCHO mas reparador ir a verla... mi estado mental cambio padrisimo, el baile, el cotorreo, sus abrazos... eso si es energia chida... no manchen, si la quiero mucho.  Y pues bueno... hoy es lunes... lunes de la ultima semana de clases de mi carrera... la ultima... que loco.  nota al pie... esta semana pude, al fin, platicar con sergio quiñones cara a cara... es la primera vez que lo veo desde mi cumpleaños y se ve 1000 veces mejor. Mucho mas feliz, fuerte, con color y joven. En mi cumpleaños me impacto mucho que alguien a quien yo quiero tanto, de mi edad, estuviera tan jodido... se veia tan viejo y desgastado... este miercoles pasado ya se parecia al mismo sergio de siempre!... que padre que el transplante de riñon le haya servido. Me impacto mucho verlo, el primer momento, ya que perdio un ojo por culpa de su enfermedad, y quieran que no si saca de onda al principio... perdio su ojo izquierdo... una lastima pero la neta es que el se ve muy feliz y muy crecido... veo en sergio a alguien sumamente en paz y espiritual, esta experiencia en su vida, el haber estado tan enfermo y todo, lo cambio muchisimo y para bien... que triste que tantas personas tengan que vivir cosas tan duras para "agarrar la onda" y darse cuenta que la vida es para ser felices y para dar amor... pero que chido que el sergio este en ese plan... bien por el.

      La ultima entrada de este blog se refiere al 13 de mayo... mayo ya termino, o bueno, esta a punto de hacerlo por lo menos... esos son 17 días que no tienen reflejo en este espacio, y 17 días que no estan documentados, precisamente por lo cargados que estuvieron de eventos y de cosas contables... Sin embargo me doy cuenta de que, siendo que los eventos pasaron hace ya tanto, se sienten menos, y dan menos ganas de escribir al respecto. Eso es triste, mas que nada porque, en su momento, fueron experiencias bastante ricas. Ese par de semanas fue semana de examenes, pero tambien semana se proyectos finales, de terminar tramites y rollos para poder graduarme, de presentaciones de canto, trabajos para innox, y rollos interesantes con tanya... muchas cosas se merecen mencion, mas que nada para que quede un registro escrito de ellas, para cuando la memoria me falle y necesite de un empujoncito para recordarlas...  El fin de semana despues de la cantada, por ejemplo, fue interesante por varias razones... el sabado le ayude a tanya a estudiar mate y pasamos la tarde juntos,  cenamos junto con su papa y su mama y todo, y fue un dia muy chido, tanya me dio un pastel poca madre y riquisimo!!... pero lo que mas marco ese dìa fue el hecho de que, yo dije "algo" que hiriò mucho a tanya, y lo hice de la manera más estùpida e inocente posible, y pues ni al caso además. El rollo es que así suceden los malentendidos, y eso fue lo que pasó aqui. Por culpa de UNA palabra mal empleada tanya en realidad se aguito, y lo peor de todo es que yo, aunque la notaba un poco rara, no sabía porque!... Lo poca madre de todo esto fue que, dias despues, tanya decidiò enfrentarme, platicar lo que pasò, y lo resolvimos de una manera poca madre!!... yo pude pedir perdon y aclarar el hecho de que todo fue un malentendido, tanya agarro la onda y los dos ya nos sentimos cómodos y contentos despues.  Bien dicen que una relación perfecta no es aquella en la que no hay conflictos... esas no existen!... una buena relación es la que sale adelante a pesar de los conflictos, y pues fue muy chido que tanya y yo pudieramos platicar de este y aclarar todas las cosas... se imaginan que hubiera pasado si nunca lo hubieramos  hablado?.   Pues bueno, el fin de semana del 16 y 17, pasaron tambien cosas chidas en cuanto al canto, el domingo por ejemplo fuimos a cantar y presentar el gloria a San Julian, y el lunes nos presentamos en un evento inter-coral en la univa, donde cantamos junto con coros del iteso, la up y la univa... (obviamente). El cotorreo de San Julian estuvo muy chido, desgraciadamente faltaron muchos, (por examenes, salud, etc), y pues a la hora de la hora fuimos solo 9 o 10 monos cantando, pero aùn asi a la gente le encanto!!... en el momento del "va pensiero" nos aplaudieron como 3 veces mientras lo cantabamos!!... gente muy sincera, de pueblo, con aplausos sinceros... gente que no aplaude si la neta no le gusta, y pues aqui lo chido es que aplaudieron un buen!!... Ademas el relajo obviamente estuvo chido, los "field trips" siempre son la onda por eso, el cotorreo en el camion, chistes, los acertijos del aldo, y pues la carrilla en general valiò la pena. (de nuevo cante solo!, he he he, cada vez como que me da menos miedo).  El evento de la univa tambien estuvo bien y cotorro... yo la verdad fui ahi a divertirme, comparados con un coro como el de la UP que tiene años de experiencia, y mas de 60 monos, pues no somos nada... pero aún así nos paramos ahí a dar lo mejor de nosotros y creo que no salió nada mal. El aplauso fue sincero y las felicitaciones también... además valió la pena por el cotorreo de nuevo, los talleres y la buena risa. Me he dado cuenta de que a mi me gusta mucho el cotorreo y la carrilla, y en ocasiones puedo pegarle a la broma en el momento indicado y todo mundo se rie!!... he he he, pues lo bueno es que eso aplicò màs de una vez ese día y estuvo muy chido. Ademas al final nos dieron nuestra playera y todo!!... :o)  Por lo demas las semanas fueron de mucho trabajo, sacar adelante materias y conflictos para poderme graduar... una bronca fue, por ejemplo, el hecho de que por andar en la cantada y demas de distraido se me olvido aplicar para mi examen TOEFL!!!... y claro que si no aplicas NO TE GRADUAS!!!... fue un show, pero al final todo se arreglo bien, me dieron chance de presentarlo despues, y en ese sentido creo que todo quedò arreglado. Lo presenté este lunes pasado, el 26... wow, que ràpdo pasa el tiempo. Igual anduve en friega terminando trabajos finales, tareas y todo el rollo para las diferentes materias. Esto de la cantada me absorvió como 15 o mas horas a la semana durante como un mes, y pues la verdad eso es MUCHO TIEMPO!!... mas durante examenes finales.  Durante ese tiempo el cotorreo con tanya era màs bien leve, ella tenìa mucho que estudiar y pues yo, la neta, muchìsimo que hacer, asì que pues nos veìamos en el tec, pasabamos un rato juntos, caminabamos y cosas asi. Fue pràcticamente hasta que terminaron examenes que pudimos comenzar a salir de nuevo!!... Aun me acuerdo muy bien de ese viernes, el viernes de la semana pasada de hecho, cuando me tocó apoyar a tanya después de que se dió cuenta de que había tronado una materia... (ciencias, ella siempre esperó tronar mate, pero NO ciencias!), y la neta fue muy dificil para mi... fue dificil porque me dolía mucho verla triste y sentirme yo tan impotente, verla tan desconsolada, aguitada, etc... y no poder hacer nada al respecto... es algo muy muy feo... querer a alguien es muy bonito, pero que esa persona sufra lo afecta a uno mucho tambièn, y pues la neta es que si quiero muy chido a tanya y no me gusta verla triste. Ese día en la tardecita fuimos a comer a casa del felix para rollos de mi graduacíón y eso, el cotorreo estuvo muy leve y creo que la distrajo un poco... pero la verdad tanya estaba muy triste y deprimida, mas porque su mama adopta una actitud muy severa en esos casos, y pues obviamente es durísimo para ella!!!... ahhh... pero bueno... hoy en día veo y recuerdo eso, y pienso "menos mal que las cosas se arreglaron"... sin embargo en el momento fue muy duro todo.  Ese día, que tanya estaba muy aguitada, yo no pude hacer mucho por ella desgraciadamente, pero una llamada que tuvo con su papa por lo visto la hizo calmarse, y pues al día siguiente la ví mucho mejor... fuimos a ver "matrics riloudet" con varios compas de la camerata y el cotorreo estuvo muy padre, fue chido verlos y hechar carrilla afuera de los ensayos!!... he he he, con eso del gus y sus "palomitas" y todo el albur que se traían yo la verdad me la pasé botado de la risa. Además la película fue muy buena... (como pelicula de acción claro), y fue la onda ir al cine con tanya de nuevo... :o)  Esa noche, cuando ya cada quien estaba feliz en su casa, tanya habló para invitarme a pasar el día con su familia al dia siguiente, y pues fui con ellos!!!... Jugamos boliche, billar, fuimos a comer y todo!!... la verdad es que me divertí muchísimo, en realidad apesto para todos esos juegos, pero a la hora de divertirme me la paso muy chido, he he he, y pues los papas de tanya son bastante buena onda y se prestan rico al cotorreo y la risa también. Comimos en un lugar de mariscos bien rico... no no no, fue un dia muy padre... si hasta eso que lo malo es que, lo acepto, me sentía un poco apenado... digo, vilmente gorrón!!... y pues no se, es raro... ahhh... demonios, creo que me preocupo por cosas que no debería... porque no puedo ser mas "hakuna matata"?!.... De cualquier manera estuvo muy chido, y ya en la tarde, cuando el papa de tanya se regreso a tepa y todo, me quedé con tanya un rato a ver una pelìcula... vimos harry potter... he he he... muuuuuuy buena...   El lunes?... ahh!!... el lunes fue un buen día... o mas bien, un regalo inesperado de un buen amigo hizo del día algo muy chido... he he he, que me dejó emocionado todo el ratote y nomas no he dejado de sonreir!. En la mañana fui temprano al tec y después a las futuras oficinas de innox, fui por mis copias de las llaves y pues para conocer el lugar y cómo va quedando todo... esta muuuuy chido!, super bien hubicado y la neta me emocionó mucho poder estar ahí... Dios espero que ese proyecto pegue, me tiene muy ilusionado!!... bueno, espero ya pronto poder dedicarle mi 100% a innox... porque desgraciadamente he estado muy desafanado, pero bueno... ojalá las cosas se vayan dando. Después de visitar la oficina regresé al tec, y ahí festejamos el cumpleaños de Clarissa... buena niña zamorana que me cae super bien!!!...   Para esto tanya fue a visitarme al cite, yipiee!!, y platique poquito con ella y la acompañè a su revision de mate... pobre tanya no sabía sus resultados y la maestra  no se los iba a dar aun... de hecho, a la hora de la comida la volví a ver y para entonces la maestra aún no les habia dicho que onda!!!... ya se imaginarán que tanya estaba bien nerviosa... ella pensaba que ya la tenia tronada pero aún asi no saber es peor!!!... pero bueno, en la comida cotorreamos chido con sandra y la banda cite, y pude presentarle a tanya a sandra, he he he... chido.  Y pues el regalo chido del dia fue un paquete que me trajo sandra, por parte de daniel... UN JUEGO DE NEVERWINTER NIGHTS!!!... juego de compu poca madre, pero que es aun mas chido porque esta AUTOGRAFIADO!!!!... el daniel se fue a BioWare y consigió que lo firmaran varios de los artistas y programadores... NO MANCHEN!!!... no no no... la cara de emociòn que puse, me sentì suuuuper emocionado, no querà hacer otra cosa que ver el juego y jugarlo y ver a daniel y darle un abrazo de agradecimiento... he he he... que regalo tan poca madre la neta... y pues si, obviamente el juego esta chidisimo!!!... he he he... y AUTOGRAFIADO!!!... que chido el daniel, neta que me da un tremendo gusto que vaya a poder hacer su sueño realidad y trabajar en una compañìa desarrolladora de video-juegos... un buen ejemplo a seguir, solo dejen defino bien mi sueño!!... he he he, pero el caso es que espero, así como él, poder cumplirlo... :oP  A pues y ese lunes hice el mentado TOEFL... de ahi en mas no paso nada muy chido... aparte del hecho de que hable con tanya en la noche para saludarla y me platicó que PASO MATE!!!!... con 70!!!... y de nuevo otra super razon para ponerme CONTENTISIMO!!!... o sea, NO TRONO!!!... me dio muchísimo gusto por ella, por muchas razones, y pues que chido... he he he... ahhh... sirvió todo su esfuerzo, no tronó!... me dió muchísimo gusto la noticia obviamente...  Y pues así llegamos al martes... un buen dia, buen avance en el trabajo (he estado aprendiendo mucho sobre xhtml, css y esas cosas), y pues la verdad lo mas cotorro sucedió hasta en la tarde, cuando fui con tanya y se nos ocurrió invitar a victor y a ireri a patinar sobre hielo!. Fuimos por ellos a casa de ireri y después le  caimos al ice-land, he he he he... la verdad es que no se puede escribir sobre el sincero miedo que tenía!!... he he he... la verdad acepté ir por tanya, yo en principio nunca hubiera pensando en ir, pero acepto que lo pasé bastante bien y creo que ya para el final patinaba... no bien, pero lo hacía!!... y eso es mucho mejor comparado con el principio cuando me la pasaba de la orillita y me daba pavor cuando tanya se le ocurriá tomarme de las manos y comenzar a jalarme... he he he... victor se cayó como 7 veces!!!... Depués del cotorreo del iceland nos juimos a un cafecito, el kattra, y pues igual, cotorreamos chido un rato...  El miercoles fue un dia de trabajo, revisiones y cosas asi... ya en la tardecita cuando pensaba poder ir con tanya y ser feliz, sucede que me hablo mi papa y me dijo "chocaron a tu madre en periferico, ve con ella"... y pues asì le hice, cosa que obviamente robó como 3 horas de mi vida!!!!.... Lo que pasa es que un trailer de la sello rojo le dio un repegòn al carro, safàndole la defensa y el faro izquierdo, cosa que enrabió a mi madre y causó que ella decidiera perseguirlo por todo periferico hasta que el mono se diera por vencido y se detuviera para "arreglar las cosas"... yo no estuve presente en todo eso, que bueno, creo que me hubiera dado mucho miedo!!!... y ya pues despues de mucha alegata y todo el cuate se hizo responsable, los seguros se pusieron de acuerdo y todo terminò estando bien.  Ya después de todo el show le hable a tanya y la pobre se sentía mal... que feo... aún así me dijo que sí quería verme y pues fui con ella un rato... nos pusimos a jugar video-juegos en su play-station (yipiee!!.... he he he, no todo mundo puede jugar con su novia asi!), y nos estabamos divirtiendo bastante cuando se le ocurriò  que jugaramos uno de carreras de motos con su volante... el volante esta chidisimo, y tambien el juego, lo que nunca se nos ocurriò es que hector se iba a emocionar tanto jugando que movio a mesa de una manera rara en el momento de dar vuelta y termino tirando todo!!!!!.... que feo!!!!... rompí el florero, todo, NO MANCHEN!!!!... ME DIO MUCHISISISISISIMA PENA!!!... y pues ya saben como me pongo cuando me da pena... ah!... que tonto...  Fuimos a comprar un pegamento a home-mart, luego a comprar líquido de los lentes a soriana, y regresamos a casa de tanya a arreglar el florero... mientras lo hacìamos todo mundo nos embarramos de pegamento en las manos, y la siguiente hora nos la pasamos intentando quitarnoslo de encima!!... he he he, con tinner, go-gone y toda una serie de cosas raras para quitar cosas asì... hijos, todo porque al tonto de hector se le ocurriò romper eso!!... eventualmente nos dimos por vencidos en a limpiada del resistol y tanya y yo nos pusimos a ver la pelicula del rey-leon 2... he he he, buena!!... y pos ya... ese fue el buen miercoles.   El jueves, ayer, fue cumpleaños de erik!!!... yipieee!!!... por lo que hubo fiesta y tamaliza en el cite desde temprano, y luego cotorreo mas en la tarde en el sirloin... para esto, como la reuniòn en el sirloin era hasta las 7:30, tanya y yo fuimos antes a la gran plaza a comprar algunas camisas o algo... fuimos a monton de lugares y termine comprando solo una camisa... QUE DIFICIL ES COMPRAR ROPA!!!!!.... pero bueno, nos ayudó para matar el tiempo. Estuvimos tanya y yo menseando por toda la plaza, nos tomamos un agua muy rica, y luego nos pusimos a cotorrear un rato para hacer tiempo. He he he... tambien le compramos un globo de pigglet al erik!, medio de broma pero la verdad pareciera que si le gustò mucho!!...  Cuando se dio la hora nos juimos al sirloin y pues lo chido es que si fue un buen de gente y se armò bien el cotorreo... muchas risas y carcajadas... la idea inicial era solo comprar barras de postres, pero por 7 pesos mas teniamos buffet completo!!!... he he he, asi que obviamente le caimos por el buffet y hasta cenamos rico!. La noche fue de puras mensadas, carrilla, albures y bromas... hace tiempo que no pasaba un rato relajado así rico. Tuve que llevar a tanya temprano a su casa, pero aún así creo que ella se la pasó bien tambien... he he he... tanya es durísima!!, y el mugre julio nos estaba hechando mucha carrilla con eso de que "ah!, al hector ya lo tronaron lo que pasa es que aún no se da cuenta"... hijos... que triste!. Bueno pues, anyway, cuando regresé de llevar a tanya estaban cantandole las mañanitas al erik, y pues fue el relajo de la mordida y todo eso... nos quedamos cotorreando un rato, contando chistes y eso, hasta que pues ya, llegò la hora de irnos a casita...   Y pues... basicamente ese serìa mi "ayer"... hoy no ha sucedido nada muy digno de contarse, asì que tendremos que esperar...

      que ha pasado?... muchas cosas... muchas cosas mas que nada en mi mente...  en realidad, no he visto a tanya, la vi un ratito ayer... pero pues no... no la he visto.  de hecho creo que va a ser un mes muy dificil en cuanto a eso, porque básicamente tenemos el mensaje de que, entre semana, mientras este estudiando su verano, NO podemos hacer nada... lo cual apesta, porque los fines de semana tampoco podemos casi, ya que es cuando aqui esta su papa, y ella tiene que estar en su casa... que feo...  la semana ha sido medio "bla", un relajo eso de solo tener un carro y eso causa toda una serie de conflictos y problemas en mi casa, coordinar a cuatro personas ocupadas, cada quien con rollos muy diferentes, no es nada facil... y luego pasan cosas como la del martes, en la que ibamos ya todos felices, y el otro carro truena!!!... ahhh que divertido fue, bueno... no fue divertido, fue mas bien irónico. Y eso le dió en la torre a mi día obviamente, porque andubimos en relajos de gruas, talleres, moviendonos en camión haciendo unos mandados, de choferes de papas, etc... (todo esto victor y yo)... bueno, ese dia, el martes, estuvo chida la noche. Nos juntamos a ver la pelicula de "requiem por un sueño" en casa de joey... eramos blanco, ireri, victor, joey y yo... chido cotorreo... PELICULA POCA MADRE!!!... nunca la habia visto... que bien hecha esta... muy dura, pero bien hecha. Yo me econtraba sinceramente triste y deprimido hacia el final de la pelicula... me da mucho corage que la gente se aproveche de las debilidades de otras personas, me da mucho corage que haya tanta tristeza en este mundo... tantos problemas por falta de autoestima y gente que abusa de la gente... que feo... mi granito de arena servira de algo?... ojala... ciertamente no lo sentía así cuando terminé de ver la movie... simplemente me dió mucho corage y pense: no vale la pena...  ayer?... si... estuvo chido... fui a la paloma con sergio, jorge y hector luis... lo unico MALO es que no pude tomarme mi cafecito de olla que tanto me gusta... todo por el TONTO autocompromiso que tome de no tomar cafe en un mes... desintoxicación?...   Estuvo muy estupido el cotorreo, basicamente hablamos de mujeres toda la tarde noche... pero la neta muy divertido, y fue chido porque a jorge no lo veia desde que salimos de la secundaria!!... buen plan... veremos si le lleva serenata a su chava o no hoy en la noche.  Hoy?... va a estar de hueva yo creo... tengo mucho trabajo, mucho sueño... muchas ganas de jugar nwn, y muchas cosas que hacer por todos lados... voy a andar de chofer de nuevo... NO ES INVERSION!!...inversión sería un carro... definitivamente me voy a comprar uno cuanto antes.  Me "autoleo" agobiado... no se porqué... muchas cosas en la cabeza... esto de graduarme el sabado me saca de onda, lo de la chamba en el tec que voy atrasado, todo lo que tengo que hacer con innox... no se. Quisiera una semana de flojo aunque sea... porque no me la di?... y pues, no se... simplemente tengo mucho en que pensar, decisiones que tomar muy fuertes... y eso no es chido. Porqué las cosas no se quedan como cuando uno es niño?... entonces no había más preocupación que la poder jugar, el dinero no era mas que algo abstracto que a veces se mencionaba, los papas parecían perfectos, no había broncas de parejas ni nada... todo era taaaan sencillo...  Daniel ya esta trabajando en BioWare... comenzó el lunes... precisamente haciendo rollos sobre el engine de NWN... poca madre... me da mucho gusto por el... tenía un sueño y lo alcanzó... espero poder seguir sus pasos, no en lo de trabajar en BioWare y eso... espero conseguirme un sueño y alcanzarlo... encontrar un punto de realización chido en lo profesional...   bueno bye...

      Pues el viernes fue un dia muy muy raro... muy "x" la verdad, en la tardecita la apatía daba a tanto que incluso a tanya y a mi no se nos ocurría que hacer, y la posibilidad de mejor no hacer nada era alta... porque será?... el clima?... Pero bueno, a pesar de todo pude trabajar, jugue un par de horas el NWN (que esta poca madre), y eventualmente sí fuí a ver a tanya... Nos quedamos un rato en su casa, buen plan, y el logro de la tarde fue que pude ponerme un LENTE DE CONTACTO!!!... es una de las cosas mas difíciles del mundo, me tarde yo creo que mas de una hora en poder... es que el ojo, por reflejo, SE CIERRA!!!... y claro que fue divertidísimo intentar lograr meterlo... Porqué quisiera yo un lente de contacto?... pues la neta, para muchas cosas, y ahora en epoca de calor siempre me acuerdo mas!!... hay muchas actividades para las que los lentes estorban un poco, el ejercicio, bailar, e incluso manejar!!... he he he, me gustaría poder traer lentes obscuros en días de sol así cañón... y pues los lentes de contacto son buena opcion...  Tengo usando lentes desde los 7 años, ya son parte de mí, e incluso la gente dice que me veo sumamente raro sin ellos... no se... si es que compro de contacto no sería por vanidad, es por practicidad... incluso me veo a mi mismo "mejor" con lentes, el wey sin lentes en el espejo simplemente no siento que sea yo... que cura es esto de la auto percepción del ser.  Ah si... volviendo al tema, el viernes fuimos en la noche al rojo cafe con victor, ireri, joey y eli, cotorreamos un rato y luego nos pasamos al bananas... chida noche, nada muy particular pero buen cotorreo. El sabado fue chido durante el dia, he he he, porque me la pase jugando el NWN... MALDITA ADICCIÓN!!!... he he he, pero es que es un juego muy bueno. El RPG gringo es muy diferente al japones, en el gringo uno juega SU personaje, va formando sus caracterisiticas y su manera de ser... muy diferente al japones en la que juegas a un personaje ya construido y simplemente vas como que leyendo un libro... esa es una buena analogía, en un RPG japones vas leyendo un buen libro, y sucede que tu eres uno de los personajes acerca de los que lees... por otra parte, en un RPG gringo tu vas de excursión en un mundo lleno de conflictos, tomando decisiones y haciendo lo que se te viene en gana... menos dirección y profundidad filosófica, pero tambien muy muy interesante...   En la tarde fuimos a patinar para despedir al buen aldo... que triste que se fue!!... y pues estuvo chido el cotorreo, patinamos chido en la pista, ME CAI HORRIBLE!!!... (todavía me duele), he he he... y la pasamos chido. Se junto una buena bola, eramos como 11 personas!, despues de patinar nos fuimos a la paloma, y luego a ver una película a casa de ireri. Vimos la pelíacula de "not another teen movie" y la estuvo muy muy curada!!... ha ha ha, y fue hasta mas divertido ir a rentarla porque nos la pasamos albureando y menseando en el carro, cantando aplaudiendo y pallazadas asi... Lo triste es que tuve que regresar a tanya temprano a su casa, tenia que estar ahi a las 8 y pues ella no pudo acompañarnos a ver la película en casa de ireri y eso... es una situación bastante dura, mas que nada para la tanya que si se aguita mucho por lo controladora que es su mamá... y pues desgraciadamente se refleja en la relación y afecta un poco la interacción entre nosotros dos... pero tanya es la onda, es chida, y la relación es con ella, no con su mamá!!... así que vamos viendo como salimos juntos de todo esto... he he he...   El domingo?... ah si!... el domingo fui a ver la obra de murmullos, para ver al buen alecs, y me lleve una grata sorpresa!... me encanto la obra... esta basada en pedro páramo y es increíble la manera en que lograron adaptarla, y como pudieron representarla tan chido con tan solo 5 personas (4 chavas y 1 cuate), la manera en la que lograron proyectar tanto... no se, me encantó!... En la noche ya me regresé a trabajar a la casa y nada particular sucedió, solo que tuve un cotorreo poca madre con el sergio quiñonez y con claudia, la hija de lolita... buena filosofada con ella, buenas risas con el... :oD  Pos a vivir...

      Al fin pude platicar con tanya... ahhhh... y probablemente pase una mejor noche que las que he pasado ultimamente... ayer tuvimos una buena charla, que creo que fue poca madre para ambos... los dos dijimos lo que teniamos en la cabeza, por lo menos eso creo, y llegamos a una conclusion en la que ambos estamos de acuerdo...  tanya es una chava muy chida en muchos sentidos, y no quiero regarla con ella ni hechar las cosas a perder... eso si me doleria, y eso si le daria en la torre a todo... incluso hablamos de la posibilidad de mejor no seguirle como novios, ya que ambos estamos viviendo etapas de mucho cambio en nuestras vidas y que dificultan la estabilidad emocional que necesita alguien para estar en una relacion y poderle ofrecer algo chido a su pareja... por un problema no vale la pena terminar las cosas, obviamente, pero pues fue una buena "bandera roja" para ponernos a pensar...  lo chido es que, despues de poner bien las cartas sobre la mesa, llegamos a la conclusion de que ibamos a seguir estando juntos y tratando de ser pacientes el uno con el otro... y pues esperando siempre lo mejor de la relación.   definitivamente buena platica.... creo que ambos aprendimos mucho... ojala el impacto en la relacion sea asi de positivo. :oD

      "si quieres hacer reir a Dios ve y cuentale tus planes"...  muy probablemente todo este relajo con tanya vaya a ser, despues de todo, prueba no superada... me da incluso flojera escribir todo lo que ha sucedido... toda una cadena de eventos desagradables desde el malentendido del viernes... no puedo creer que por un malentendido tan chiquito esten pasando tantos problemas, ya me imagino cuando en realidad sucedan cosas dificiles... pues bien dije que una relacion en realidad esta a prueba hasta que se topa con conflictos, y las relaciones exitosas son las que salen bien paradas de esos conflictos...  no se que va a pasar...

      Han pasado demasiadas cosas en las ultimas 3 semanas... tantas que simplemente no puedo contarlas todas con el detalle que se merecen... y tantas tan importantes que simplemente no puedo dejar de mencionar...  Hoy en dia me encuentro viviendo un proceso de lo mas interesante, y es que me gustaria simplemente comenzar a escribir a partir de lo que estoy viviendo en este instante... pero no... debo de mencionar un par de cosas que merecen un espacio en este blog, y que merecen ser recordadas...  Por ejemplo... por lo ultimo que estaba escrito se pudo notar tal vez una nota "triste" respecto a mi relacion con tanya... como que las cosas se estaban apagando y que casi no nos veiamos ni nada... pues la verdad es que eso ya quedo atras, y hoy por hoy estoy muy feliz de esa relacion y seguro de que quiero que funcione. Hace como 3 semanas tuvimos un dia "magico" la verdad, y a partir de ahi mis sentimientos han ido creciendo mas y mas, y asegurandose mas... ese dia fuimos al trompo magico en la mañana y nos divertimos como enanos en todas las secciones, luego en la tarde jugamos juegos en su casa, vimos peliculas y todo, y en la tarde/noche nos fuimos a un cafe un platicamos POCA MADRE de rollos bien elevados.. fue como que hicimos de todo ese dia y padrisimo... me encanto y me hizo enamorarme muchisimo mas de tanya... a partir de ahi hemo seguido compartiendo mucho, saliendo, viendonos en el tec, por telefono, mail y todo... igual y seguimos sin vernos o salir mucho, pero siempre "estamos el uno con el otro", pensando siempre en el otro, extrañandonos y queriendonos... es poca madre... aun a pesar de problemas fuertes la relacion esta madurando y creciendo... problemas como el del viernes pasado en el que yo, por estupido, cause un mal entendido que hizo que la mama de tanya se aguitara muchisimo y ademas de darle en la torre a nuestra tarde y nuestros planes, cause que tanya se enojara conmigo, la suegra se enojara conmigo y con tanya, y todo el rollo... y aun no se como vaya a terminar todo ese capitulo del libro, pero una cosa me queda clara: mi relacion con tanya esta creciendo, ella me quiere mucho de neta, a pesar de todo, asi como la quiero a ella... y asi las cosas van a irse dando poco a poco... las reaciones "perfectas" no existen, y se ponen a prueba en situaciuones de conflicto... tengo fe en que esta vaya a ser para nosotros una "prueba superada"...  por otro lado pues ya soy ingeniero!... me gradue!!... :oS  el 7 de junio pase a recibir mi titulo y pues wow... ha sido todo un show que ha desencadenado toda una serie de eventos en mi vida, y de rollos en la cabeza... Ese dia fue muy padre, lleno de abrazos y sonrisas... lo pase muy bien y pude compartirlo con la gente a la que mas quiero... el acto academico estuvo chido, Rangel cambio de discurso!!!!... el brindis muy divertido, el cotorreo con todos mis amigos genial, y ese dia en la noche la fiesta estuvo muy padre... tanya se veia preciosa!!... :o)  baile muy chido con ella, y tambien bailamos en bola con amigos y familia, fue un rato muy agradable... y pues ya... fue mi primer dia como ingeniero... a la fiesta no pude invitar a tantas personas, pues porque simplemente no tengo tanta lana!!!... pero fueron el hector luis, ale, tomas, erik, victor, ireri, enrique, y por supuesto tanya!!... he he he... y pues al sabado de la siguiente semana organice una super cena en la casa que se convirtio en una fiesta muy muy chida... vinieron como 60 personas, amigos de muchos contextos diferentes y creo que todo mundo se divirtio!... nunca habia habido tantas personas en la casa yo creo, y pues yo andaba como loco pasando ratitos con cada grupo de personas... pero estuvo poca madre!!!... y pues ese dia tanya fue por primera vez a mi casa y al fin conocio el lugar en donde vivo... he he he... apenas!!!... pero pues es importane que la novia hubique la casa de su novio no?!... ;)  En resumen ha habido cotorreos chidos, salidas con el joey, blanco, incluso cotorreos con el julio, quedadas a dormir de erik, tomas, joey y el blanco, y eventos asi... divertidos...   Uno de los rollos definitivamente mas impactantes ha sido la creacion de innox... empresa desarrolladora de software, proyecto grande e interesante, con mucha fuerza, que no sabemos a donde vaya a parar... el miercoles de la semana pasada "firmamos" en la notaria y oficialmente somos sociedad... oficialmente ya formo parte de una sociedad, soy dueño de una empresa y pues vamos a ver que pasa con todo eso... si hasta eso que mucho de los ajeres han sido por culpa de eso, y de uqe no estoy seguro de que eso sea lo que quiero en mi vida... no se que ondas con eso y me molesta mucho. Innox es una muy buena ola, que como todo surfiste brinque a ella... ahora el problema es que no estoy seguro de que sea la ola que en verdad quiero tomar...  Jorge Suarez, un cuate con mucha sabiduria para su edad, me puso a pensar muy cañon... y gracias a sus preguntas ahora tengo una certeza: no quiero ser empleado... quiero crear mi propia empresa y ser parte de algo mas grande que yo mismo... eso lo tengo seguro, y si hasta eso que tambien tengo seguro el tipo de empresa que quiero lograr, y el sueño que tengo... sin embargo esa empresa no es innox, y eso me conflictua muchisimo... ultimamente he traido muchos rollos en la cabeza, tantos que no puedo dormir bien, me duele la cabeza, gastritis, etc... pero tengo una certeza y un sueño... Daniel, buen amigo, tuvo mucho que ver al mandarme un mail poca madre, y el chiste es uqe no quiero perder ese sueño de vista y caer en cosas que no...en cosas que probablemente me den mucho dinero, pero no realizacion personal... NO me da miedo ser emprendedor, quiero serlo y crear ese tipo de empresa que no existe en mexico... lo que me preocupa es mi papel y compromiso con innox... y el hecho de que en realidad son empresas y sueños muy diferentes... en innox necesitan alguien como yo, ellos lo saben y lo valoran, pero simplemente es cumplir un requisito... una parte de las cosas que necesitan para la meta... poca madre, pero lo que yo quiero es una empresa 100% creativa... yo quiero crear una organizacion en la que los empleados se sientan agusto de trabajar, que se vayan vestidos como quieran, con jugetes en los escritorios y arte de todo tipo en las paredes... con video-juegos en la sala de juntas, un traba-hobbie en el que la gente se quede desvelando por amor al arte, y donde los trabajadores quieran estar ahi porque les divierte y les reta en lo intelectual y en lo creativo dia a dia... quiero una organizacion que logre sacar y mostrar lo mejor de sus clientes, con conceptos siempre nuevos y diferentes, que impacten a la sociedad y les permitan a nuestros clientes mostrar mejor sus productos o servicios... y una organizacion que logre generar suficiente dinero para permitir una vida digna a cada empleado, en la que probablemente no nos hagamos ricos, pero si nos hagamos felices y plenos... quiero que en unos años salgan "screen-shots" de nuestros trabajos en libros de diseño internacionales, como muestras de excelencia en lo visual... quiero mucho... lo se... pero lo quiero y lo tengo muy claro...  innox seria el "cliente" ideal para esa empresa que quiero crear... pero NO es esa empresa... vaya... creo que tengo que platicar claro y tendido con los de innox... y veremos como se va arreglando todo esto.  para resumen de las ultimas semanas creo que esto estuvo "bien"... muy escueto la verdad... y la mayoria de los eventos merecen mucho mas detalle... pero por lo menos estas pocas lineas me ayudaran a recordad un poco en el futuro... y pues narran mas o menos que es lo que ha estado pasando por mi vida ultimamente...  greetings...

      "all I can do is just pour some tea for two"...  ahh!... que poca madre es la rola de "no rain"... hijos... acaba de comenzar a sonar y se me fue la onda de lo que queria escribir... la vida?... va muy bien... interesante, diferente.... curiosamente he pensado mucho en tanya, no me gusta la manera en la que quedaron las cosas, mas que nada porque "sabe amargo"... como que algo simplemente no quedo bien.... quedar como amigos siempre es dificil, pero  "quedar en paz" es lo mejor... el hecho de que ella haya siquiera pensado que tanto trabajo era solo un pretexto para no verla, o para ver a otra mujer, me hace ver que pues las cosas terminaron de manera un poco destructiva... espero que con el tiempo podamos reencontrarnos y charlar...   le deseo o lo mejor...  innox cada dia me gusta mas... el hecho de que todos digan "uh ha ha" en cuando alguno dice "tiburoncìn" me hace darme cuenta que, despues de todo, no eran tan diferentes a mi como yo pensaba.... :o)   Algunos enfoques y todo si claro, pero la neta es banda muy chida, el trabajo a verdad esta padre... estoy haciendo lo que mas me gusta y por aca les encanta... no me gustan dos cosas: 1) hay demasiada chamba, 2) no hay lana.... creo que si una de las dos no estuviera ahi las cosas estarian mejor, he he he... pero esa convinación de factores es muy mala...  bueno.... me retiro.  pd. ayer fui de nuevo al grupo de meditacion y estudio de energias... creo que voy a aprender muchisimo ahi.

      mi bien descuidado blog.... he comenzado mucho mis entradas con un "hace mucho que no escirbo"... se esta convirtiendo en un patron, asi que ya no tiene caso que lo diga de nuevo...  mucho que contar, novedades?... ya no tengo novia... me trono por mail...   las cosas simplemente no iban bien... derrepente nos encontramos en contextos muy diferentes a los que nos unieron y eso le dio en la torre a la relación... estoy en una etapa de mi vida en la que no tengo tiempo ni para mi, menos para compartirlo con alguien mas... no me gusta que las cosas hayan terminado asi, por correo... pareciera que hace falta "closure", pero debo de respetar la decisión de tanya... por lo menos eso se merece.  creo que ambos tenemos mucho que aprender de esta relación... crecer.  Vi high  fidelity... una pelicula poca madre que en verdad te pone a pensar bastante sobre las relaciones de pareja, fantasias con otras mujeres y ese hecho de buscar y encontrar a ese "alguien"...  por cierto, cambie el temlate de mi blog... me late asi, mas blanco y con luz... el otro me habia sinceramente hartado... se me hace muy obscuro...

      poco a poco se estan institucionalizando los "viernes de IBM"... interesante banda y la verdad es que la paso bien... ayer jugamos buen magic, he he he... y vaya que me fue muy bien... que duro!, hasta me daba pena con mis contrincantes... :oP he he he... pero bueno, no fue para tanto, y la vez pasada me metieron una retro paliza a mi, así que creo que estamos a mano...  yo por lo pronto sigo con la cuestion del ser... y no es que quiera saber quién soy... ni tampoco es que creo estar tan perdido en ese sentido, simplemente es un rollo muy interesante... yo soy hector, aquel al que le gustan hacer ciertas cosas, que se junta con ciertas personas, lee ciertos libros, y tiene ciertas actitudes... pero ese hector es "aquel que hace", no "aquel que es"...  el "hector que es" esta mas arriba, estaría como en una capa mas "core" de un modelo de abstracción... cuando hector ya no hace, ni puede hacer, quien queda?... me pregunto si es una de esas cosas en las que, mientras eres parte del sistema no puedes observar el todo... tal vez es una de esas cosas que cuando me muera voy a ver hacia atras, hacía "mi" y decir "ahhhh!!... pero era tan obvio!!... mientras me rio y me alejo de este cuerpo a sabe dónde...  ayer tuve una conversación interesante con mi hermano en el auto, ya que ibamos de regreso a la casa... conversación muy similar a una que tuve con allàn hace unos meses por las canchas del tec... mi hermano y yo somos muy diferentes en muchas cosas, sin embargo tienemos cosas en común, esas cosas en común que hacían que mi hermano hablara de los "neardentales" en el bar y la hueva que le daba verlos... creo que mi hermano también esta despierto, a su manera. Cuando le pregunté -porqué somos así?...- su respuesta coincidió mucho con lo que platicabamos aquella vez allan y yo... y además fue un poco más alla... dijo:   "creo que nosotros, los que somos así, vivímos alguna experiencia en la primaria o secundaria que nos separó del grupo y nos hizo encontrar manera diferentes de pasar el tiempo... fuimos segregados de "la bola" por alguna razón, y así nos volvimos más empáticos con la vida y con los demás... encontramos en la conversación, los libros y otro tipo de convivencia un mundo de lo más interesante... y ahora, cuando ya crecemos y podemos ser parte de ese mundo "de todos" la verdad nos da hueva... y mejor nos ponemos a hacer cosas más interesantes... aunque la mayoría de la persona no lo encuentre así"...  será?.... vaya.. la neta es que no dijo eso con esas palabras... pero ese es el resumen y la idea... el hecho es que mientras todos los niños jugaban fut-bol en la primaria yo tuve que encontrar una manera diferente de pasar el recreo... no me gustaba el futbol, y mucho tenía que ver yo creo el hecho de ser "rellenito", que era malísimo, y por eso nunca me escogían... así llegue a encontrarme con un grupo de personas muy interesantes, fundadores de la "sociedad del apaciguado rincón"... y ahí comenzó la filosofía y la tontería... en los pasillos de la primaria y la secundaria... mientras los demás jugaban fut.

      ok... testing successfulll... blogger somehow is sucking and messing up the "acentos"... from now on, till I forget about this oath, this shall be an "acento less" blogger...  anyway...   pareciera que la frase de ayer causo algo de interés en algunas personas que leyeron este blog... cual frase?...  la de:  "el amar, la experiencia del amor y amar a alguien, curiosamente, pareciera obstruir el mismo acto de amar... es una de las cosas que "la practica" no mejora... mientras mas se enamora uno, menos puede hacerlo... mas irreal se siente ese acto, esa magia... se pierde esa inocencia del verdadero amor... ese amor que se siente cuando uno no sabe amar, y lo hace por primera vez... "  es una frase dura?... tal vez... pero es cierta... nos habla de como uno va creciendo, madurando, y alejándose más de lo que uno en verdad viene a ser en este mundo.... FELIZ...   y no lo digo de manera fatalista o destructiva... no implico que cuando crecemos nos vamos olvidando de la felicidad... sin embargo es el comun denominador, la mayoria de las personas viven una vida que los vive a ellos... con pequeños logros "esperados" por la sociedad, donde se sienten medianamente feliz ya que mas o menos logran lo que todo mundo esperaba que ellos lograran... pero y ellos?... donde estan?...  ayer en la clase de manejo de energia paso algo interesante, bueno, mas bien despues de la clase...  fuimos a un cafe y un cuate compartio conmigo varias cosas y platicamos de manera interesante... pareciera que el tipo este tiene un poder muy fuerte, por asi decirlo, y ademas esta consciente de ellos... pero bueno, el caso es que me dijo que queria conocerme, y que le platicara de mi... cuando comence a platicar un poco sobre "el padilla", y el atinadamente me detuvo y me dijo...  "no me interesa saber lo que haces... ni lo que te gusta... quiero que me digas quien eres..."  eso obviamente me puso a pensar muchisimo, y fue el pie de una conversacion muy interesante... quien soy?... como puedo definirme a mi mismo a partir de mi mismo?... o de conceptos externos que puedan definirme?... pero yo no soy el que hace, o aquel que tiene gustos... soy algo mas... alquien que esta aqui, consciente de que tiene un papel mas importante en este mundo del que puede vislumbrar por el momento... pero tambien consciente de que la busqueda de ese papel no tiene sentido... llegara, y la busqueda en si puede estorbar el mismo acto de vivir... la busqueda pasiva es mejor...  vivir por vivir y porque me da gusto estar vivo... vivir para aprender...  vivir para mi.  tengo muchas cosas que aprender y pensar...   sabe....

O_O     ok... si la "i" de ortografía aparece como algo que NO sea una "i" con acento, esta cosa comenzará a ser escrita SIN acentos...  O_O otro!!... comenzará tiene acento!!....

      Ayer fui a la gran plaza para verme con unos amigos, pollo, memo, julian y allan... a la hora de la hora no entramos al cine y mejor decidimos ir a un cafe... yo, por supuesto, sugerí ir a la paloma... fue una buena tarde, aunque debo de confesar que la situaci?n del papa de juan carlos no me dejaba en paz, incluso me tomo tiempo poder conciliar el sue?o... no se que har?a si estuviera en su lugar... :oS  por otro lado, fui a comer con el obby y estuvo muy chido porque pudimos platicar buen plan de cosas X, y el es, de los otros miembros de innox, el cuate con el que menor contacto he tenido... fue una buena charla sobre "mujeres y traiciones"... he he he... el tema rondaba cerca del amor, el hecho de que las relaciones son de lo m?s complicadas, y lo bonito que es un "amor inocente"... la inocencia del primer amor es sumamente especial... con una magia que, desgraciadamente, no se repite....  ya despues pareciera que uno se va volviendo un poco m?s c?nico... con m?s capas protectoras y mucho mas incrédulo respecto a una relaci?n... cuando ya se han vivido decepciones la etapa "rosa" se ve como una irrealidad temporal, se ve de manera calculada como algo que simplemente va a terminar... antes no, la primera vez todo era rosa y esa etapa era eterna y el amor era lo mas poca madre del mundo...   uno se ir? haciendo m?s frio?... menos sensible?... el amar, la experiencia del amor y amar a alguién, curiosamente, pareciera obstruir el mismo acto de amar... es una de las cosas que "la pr?ctica" no mejora... mientras m?s se enamora uno, menos puede hacerlo... mas irreal se siente ese acto, esa magia... se pierde esa inocencia del verdadero amor... ese amor que se siente cuando uno no sabe amar, y lo hace por primera vez...  ...

      "We have art so that we shall not die of reality"...  que buena frase... la tome del libro de "meeting the shadow" que me ha prestado el buen allan... nada que ver con el libro la frase, pero hasta ahorita es de lo que mas me ha gustado... he he he. El libro es bueno... no lo queria leer, el titulo "me intimidaba"... me daba miedo... pero la verdad es que no hay nada que temer, no es nada que yo no crea ni que haya pensado...  digamos que el libro es una crítica a la hipocresía y a la actitud destructiva que tenemos los humanos de "olvidar" y negar tantas cosas de nuestra propia naturaleza... y es que desde chiquitos como que nos van programando para "eso esta mal", "eso esta mal"... y bla bla bla hasta que traemos un equipaje horriblemente grande de cosas reprimidas que en muchas ocasiones no nos permite crecer... represiones sexuales, de sentimiendos, de enojos, y de tantas cosas que NO deberíamos reprimir...  el rollo no es agarrarse haciendo todas las barbaridades que uno quiera, pero tampoco es negar que tenemos esas necesidades y ese "dark side"... el chiste es encontrar una manera positiva de sacar y canalizar esos deseos, esos enojos, esa ira y todas esas cosas "malas"... pero canalizarlos, no negarlos... negarlos nomas va creando bloqueos de energía, traumas, y más corages reprimidos que eventualmente vienen a jodernos en algún punto de nuestra vida...  tenemos que aprender a entendernos a nosotros mismos, todo, lo "bueno" y lo "malo"... y a no reprimir tantas cosas y negarlas de nuestra propia naturaleza... tenemos que permitirnos ser nosotros, con todo lo que eso implica, y solo así nos convertimos en una persona completa en realidad, en comunión completa con su "yo" interior.  **cheers**...

      estaba a punto de dormirme, pero ahora no puedo... estoy sumamente emocionado, melancolico y con un sentimiento de esos que lo dejan a uno estar en paz... y es que mi mama acaba de decirme algo padrisimo, y no puedo dejar de sonreir!!... y al mismo tiempo de soñar... de extrañar, y de sentirme feliz!...  llego mi mama platicandome de un chavo de la UP que vivio el año pasado en "western illinois university", el lugar donde yo vivi... y un poquito mas aun, el vivio en las mismas residencias donde yo vivi!!... pues resulta que el mono platico con mi mama sobre todo el rollo por alla, y le platico a mi mama acerca de un tipo por alla, "un mexicano" que estuvo antes que el que dejo huella cañonsísimo... y que siempre que el decia que venia de mexico le decian "aqui estuvo un mexicano que era super chido, se llevaba con todos los residentes, con los coordinadores, super buena onda y activo... bla bla bla"... y pues resulta que el compa estaba HABLANDO DE MI!!!...  LA GENTE HABLA Y PLATICA DE MI!!... deje huella!!...  me siento muy sacado de onda poca madre... pero el hecho es que los coordinadores y muchos residentes hacian   referencia a mi y en plan poca madre, y no manches... es que, no se que me da!!... una emocion como no tienen idea, una sensación de un exito inesperado... una sensación de "wey... vas bien"...  es como que dejas huella... trasciendes... una parte de mi se quedó ahí y ahora no puedo dejar de recordar a tantas personas, tantas cosas que hice por alla... y lo más poca madre es que me involucre chido con toda esa gente y el "hall government" y todo antes de andar con abby, o sea, nada que ver con que "pues si el wey era novio de bla bla bla"... fueron cosas poca madre... tanto que me mandaron de representante del "hall" a una conferencia a chicago!!... he he he... y ni era de su universidad...  vaya... no se que decir... no quiero sonar presumido ni nada... solo queria escribir esto en mi blog... sacar un poco el sentimiento que traigo, la emoción y conmoción y todo eso que estoy sintiendo...  estoy exagerando?... no creo... a quienes han vivido cosas similares podrán imaginarse lo que siento...  ahhh... quisiera regresar y darle un abrazo a toda esa gente que deje atras... a toda esa gente en la que deje un poco de mí y un buen recuerdo... me hace ver que todo lo que vivi alla trasciende muchas cosas, que en efecto vivi y tuve experiencias con muchas más personas que con abby... y que cada segundo que estuve alla valio la pena por mil razones...  GRACIAS WEY QUE HABLO CON MI MAMA!... mensajero desconocido de un mensaje inesperado... pero mensaje que indica que uno va por buen camino...  no se... me siento bien con la vida...  emocionado... vivo... contento...   esas son señales que me hacen ver que no voy tan mal despues de todo...  AHHH!!.. SI!!!.... HE HE HE....

      En ocasiones me encuentro en un dilema, leer un libro nuevo, o releer un viejo libro que me ha gustado mucho?... Es un poco como en las películas... ver una película nueva?, o ver una que me gusta?... sin embargo en el caso de los libros la decisión implica muchas más horas de "trabajo".... por lo cual la decisión es un poco más dificil...  Y es que hay tantos libros, y tan buenos... de los que se pueden aprender tantas cosas, que simplemente dan ganas de leerlos todos... absorverlos... sin embargo, me pasa que me topo en mi librero con un buen libro que me ha gustado, lo tomo... lo ojeo... recuerdo el mensaje que me dejó y lo mucho que disfrute leerlo... pero no recuerdo detalles... detalles que quiero recordar... y me dan ganas de leerlo de nuevo. Sin embargo veo hacia el librero y veo otros tantos que no he leido... ahi sentados esperando a ser explorados por primera vez... y ahi es donde se topa uno con el dilema...  la solución debería ser sencilla no?... simplemente seguir leyendo los nuevos... seguir aprendiendo... pero no, no es tan sencilla... yo creo que es casi tan dificil como aprender a dejar atrás... a menor escala es un ejemplo de la misma situación... será o estoy inventando?...   pero neta... me causa problemas existenciales... leer un nuevo libro para aprender más?... o reeler un excelente libro para recordar más?...  ----  Ayer tuve una de esas charlas poca madre con laura y sergio... como me da corage no tener grabadoras en esas ocasiones!... hay ciertas personas con las que se tienen conversaciones que pueden ser material para un libro la neta!!...  esa charla fue una de ellas... platicamos de muchísimas cosas, pero básicamente alrededor de rollos de metafísica y esas ondas que estoy estudiando...   la vida es un lugar interesante... lleno de reencuentros y de encuentros... de aprendizajes, sin sabores, y emociones fuertes...  ... el corazón... la respuesta siempre esta en el corazón... lo malo es cuando queremos pensar, ahi es cuando todo se hecha a perder...

"le falta una copia de nos e que"... "necesita una autorizacion de ... " bla bla bla...   pero bueno... ya tengo un carro nuevo a mi nombre!!... :oD  ahora el chiste va a ser poder pagarlo para que sea mio... por lo pronto sera de mis padres... oh pues... asi es la vida, lo chido es que tenemos un carro nuevo y eso va a agilizar el movimiento en la casa...  bueno... a chambear...

      es lunes... una nueva semana esta a punto de comenzar, una semana diferente, con sus nuevos retos, pequeños triunfos y su par de sinsabores... yo aca en la oficina y sin red, estoy escribiendo esto en mi "block de notas" para mas al rato pegarlo en el blog... estoy escuchando una rola de "rusted root"... grupo muy poco conocido por estos rumbos pero con una propuesta musical muy interesante, muy "rusted root" de hecho... he he he... me pone en un estado mental medio raro...   es curioso que la mùsica tiene ese efecto en nuestras mentes y estado de animo... la manera en la que nos afecta... nos cambia   pues vengo de negro, o por lo menos muy obscuro... al rato ire a casa del yanqui a darle su abrazo y ofrecerle mi apoyo... que venga...  mmm... no hay red, me desespera no poder checar mi correo...   pd. (obviamente ya regreso la red..  ya que estoy pegando esto... ahora si, a responder correos).

      ayer platique un poco con daniel sobre la vida... o mas bien sobre la muerte, y el hecho de que a nuestra edad nos sentimos y nos creemos inmortales e invencibles, que nada nos puede pasar y que además, tampoco le pasará nada a los que nos rodean... nuestros padres son eternos, y tenemos toooda la vida por delante.  pues no... no somos eternos y cada vez que le dices "bye" a alguien bien puede ser la ultima vez que los veas... cada vez que te despides de un amigo, de tus padres, de quien sea... cada vez que te despides de alquien bien puede ser la ultima vez que te vean... la ultima vez que estes vivo para decirles adios...  lo que me recuera algo que pense hace poco en una platica con jorge... si las cosas siguen bien, puede ser que nos vaya muy bien en la empresa... entre mucho dinero y todas esas cosas "buenas"... que chido... y el decia que entonces iba a poder hacer lo qeu le gustaba... ya se iba a poder dedicar a foto y todas esas cosas, pero mientras tanto tenía que "chingarle" para poder eventualmente disfrutar asi de la vida...  y te mueres mañana?... y si te mueres al rato?... ya no la disfrutaste porque siempre viviste tu presente para vivir un mejor futuro... pero es un futuro que nadie te promete que vaya a estar ahi...  creo que tenemos que ver hacia adelante, pero enfocarnos en el presente... en el único instante en el que en verdad existimos y estamos vivos... el unico instante en el que cuentan nuestras acciones y decisiones...

      hoy como a las 5 de la mañana falleció el papa del yanqui... nos enteramos hoy en la mañana, aqui en la oficina... si, es domingo y estamos en la oficina... no se que decir, estoy pensando demasiadas cosas... es un momento para estar con el yanqui de manera asertiva, y este suceso marca la pauta para muchos cambios en la vida de juan carlos... espero poder ser de apoyo para el...   en ocasiones es difcil porque siento que de los 4 miembros de innox, yo soy el menos "amigo"... me invitaron porque consideran que soy bueno en lo que hago, y me llevo muy bien con ellos... conforme ha pasado el tiempo cada vez hay mas integracion y cotorreo buen plan... pero aún así, a ratos en una ocasion asi me siento raro... no fuera de lugar, pero raro... como que no encuentro bien mi papel...  a apoyarlo se ha dicho...  por cierto, latilde.com ya es oficialmente simplemente mi blog... he he he, asi que si alguien mas lo lee aún puede entrar a la tilde.com y directo entrar al blog... en los proximos dias voy a cambiar la imagen del sitio y poner mi propio template, e intentaré hacer de esto un "pensadero" oficial en el que escribiré mas seguido...   siento que tenía algo muy interesante e importante que escribir... pero con todo esto ya se me olvido...

      Es viernes... son las 11:15 de la noche y a pesar del hecho de que me la paso todo el día en frente de una computadora no puedo evitar la necesidad de sentarme de nuevo, frente a un monitor, a sacar ideas... y es que de nuevo no puedo ir a acostarme asi nomas, de nuevo tengo muchas cosas en la cabeza y mucho sentimientos que simplemente tengo que sacar... y esto que siento no se puede calmar con un rato de lectura, no es un sentimiento pasivo, es un sentimiento activo y creador... que necesita sacar cosas y expersarlas... ese sentimiento que obliga al artista a hacer "manchones" y expresar sensaciones sin formas reconocibles... y justo de eso es de lo que siento necesidad ahorita... pero como no tengo un lienzo y pintura, (note to self: tener lienzo y pintura siempre a la mano), pues mejor me pongo a hacer esos manchones sin forma aparente a manera de escritura...  eso si... pobre de mí cuando tenga que realizar este tipo de "terapia" sin una computadora... estoy tan acostumbrado a escribir en un teclado que la velocidad es incomparable, y creo que tener asi un "tren mental" loco sobre un cuaderno me costaría mucho trabajo... o por lo menos me costaría mucho trabajo intentar leerlo más adelante... por la velocidad tan grande a la que corren mis ideas.  acabo de regresar de una cena con banda cite... con mi familia y gente a la que quiero mucho... buenas risas y buenos recuerdos... camaradas sinceros y compañeros de trabajo por necesidades más alla del dinero, aceptémoslo, para hacernos ricos no estabamos ahí... estábamos para aprender y ser parte de algo más grande que nosotros mismos, para soñar juntos y lograr cosas poca madre de las que todos nso sentíamos orgullosos al final, siendo siempre los mejores.  la vida nos va reacomodando a unos y a otros... y hoy en un punto de la cena casi, casi se me sale una lágrima... me puse muy sentimental y la neta si no hubiera estado tanta gente le hubiera dado un abrazo a rosario y probablemente me hubiera puesto a llorar... recorde el principio de ese sueño, esa etapa en la que eramos rosario, daniel y yo... esa etapa en la que juntos vivimos y logramos tantas cosas, en las que yo me esforcé al máximo por sentirme "al nivel" y demostrarle a daniel que tenía algo que ofrecer en ese equipo de trabajo!... si... la relación con daniel es poca madre pero al principio nos tuvimos que acoplar, conocer, retar mutuamente hasta llegar a un punto de sincero respeto y admiración mutuos... pero fue todo un proceso y fue un proceso de lo más rico y bonito... la neta... y ahora daniel estando tan lejos es uno de mis amigos más cercanos y alguien a quien quiero mucho... y de rosario ni se diga... emas que una amiga... una mujer con la que he podido ser yo, llorar abiertamente y ser completamente vulnerable... y ella siempre ha estado ahi para decirme que todo va a estar bien... wow...  demonios ya me puse sentimental...  pero es que asi me puso la noche... la cena, la vista la compañía y las charlas con estas personas, junto con los recuerdos que me evocaban... la plática con pepe me recordó muchas charlas que tuve con daniel, pepe es un tipazo... que buena charla.  y es que ahora me encuentro en una etapa tan nueva de mi vida, tan llena de sueños y aspiraciones en la que, a veces, es taaan necesario parar y detenerse un rato para ver todas esas cosas que estan sucediendo de manera tan vertiginosa... las cosas en innox van muy bien y el ritmo al que estamos vamos a crecer en todos los sentidos pronto... ojala sea un sueño hecho realidad y el encuentro de hoy me emocionó mucho porque hay sincero interés por esos compañeros de vida de seguir en el mismo sueño... por esa "banda cite" de convertirse en parte del sueño de innox y formar parte, ahí también, de algo más grande que ellos mismos y que ellos mismos pueden ayudar a crear... sería mi sueño poder ofrecerles trabajo interesante, retador, gratificante y que además les de buena lana a toda esa banda... sería mi sueño hecho realidad poder seguir trabajando y compartiendo ideales y metas con ellos... y quien sabe, pero "puede que pueda ser"... puede que algunos de ellos quieran brincarle a este barco... que orgullo y que felicidad me da...  como lo he dicho antes... se trata de trascender... de dejar huella... de lograr algo más grande que tu mismo en este mundo, de tocar y afectar de manera positiva más vidas que la tuya... de realizar tu leyenda personal y más alla...   cada paso, cada decisión que tomamos nos vamos acercando mas a nuestro futuro... y lo vamos construyendo... y es que es algo tan trascendental que cada paso podríamos pasarnosla muy temerosos de regarla, pero tampoco se trata de eso... pasos seguros, y con la seguridad de que si se da un "paso en falso" ni modo, y si se tropieza uno, pues ni pez y se vuelve a intentar... pero eso sí, sin dejar de caminar... yo ahora cuento, y que chido, con el apoyo de mis padres que entienden mi situación y me tienen paciencia... ellos saben que si me metiera a alguna empresa a trabajar podría ganar 10,000 pesos mensuales y tener una vida "bien" por un buen rato... y probablemente falta rato para que innox asegure una cantidad de esa magnitud... pero vaya, es que tengo tan fuerte ese fuego dentro de mí, tan prendido ese sueño y ese sentimiento de que esto es lo correcto y lo que debo de estar haciendo... no puedo esperar a ver a dónde me van a llevar todas estas horas de trabajo, friegas y sacrificios... pero siento que será a algo poca madre...   un soñador profesional... eso soy... y suena a buena profesión la verdad... quiero dedicarme a vivir ya disfrutar mis segundos... y aunque tengo sueños ambiciosos para el futuro NO DEBO olvidar que solo existo en el presente y en este instante... y solo AHORITITA es donde vale la pena sentirme bien con mi vida... he he he... lo mas chido es que asi es... me siento bien...   ...  sigo con esa sensación... me hace falta mucho que decir... pero no lo puedo sacar... y siento que si continuo escribiendo será para repetir ideas... y tampoco eso tiene sentido...  mientras tanto sigamos peleando contra los hombres grises... y definitivamente entrare en alguna especie de regimen alimenticio, buscando hacer alguna especie de ejercicio... he he he... aunque sea por salud, ya ni por vanidad...  ** cheers ** - y si tu estas leyendo esto, y no eres hector padilla... gracias por escucharme, se que muchas veces no tiene sentido, pero es chido sentir que tus ideas rebotan en mas paredes que las de la mente propia... un abrazo.

      la vida es una cosa curiosa... y más cuando uno acaba de comer, justo ahorita todo se siente "lento" y no dan ganas de nada... solo de pensar... probablemente por eso varios filosofos eran "rellenitos"... se la pasaban comiendo y gozando de ese curioso estado de letargo que te crea la sensación de estar saciado por una buena comida...  lo único que falto fue el vino... un buen vino tinto junto con esa lasagna que nos acabamos de hechar hubiera sido la onda...  y es que bien dicen "después de comer, ni una carta leer"... he he he...  así que yo solo y mis pensamientos nos la pasamos muy bien... no entiendo como todo mundo se puede poner a trabajar luego luego... ESO NO ESTA BIEN!!... debe uno de dejar descansar la comida...  por cierto, hablando de comida y otros pecados, mi cinturón que no creo que heche mentiras, ya me dice que definitivamente mi talla esta cambiando... por más que la báscula quiera verse condescendiente creo que definitivamente estoy subiendo de peso... muy triste!!... mas que nada por mi espalda y todas esas cosas...  el lunes comenzaré una especie de dieta, que más bien va a constar de eliminar de mi hábitos todos esos gansitos y cocas que he consumido ultimaente... me va a costar trabajo dejarlos... pero va a ser necesario...

      Ayer fue un buen dia en muchos sentidos... de esos dias llenos de cosas y que terminan siendo días muy ricos en experiencias y todas esas cosas interesantes... en innox por ejemplo ya vimos que nos esta comiendo la operación, y que al mes y medio que llevamos ya tenemos muchiíiiisimo trabajo!... eso es poca madre por un lado, pero puede darnos en la torre... lo chido es que obviamente vamos a tomar al toro por los cuernos y darle cañon a la chamba, invitando más gente a que trabaje con nosotros y por un sueño... lo más padre de todo esto es sentir que no estas solo, y que hay personas que comparten tu ambición en la vida... como es el caso de oscar, ayer platique laaargo y tendido con él y la idea de que el se suba a este barco y podamos trabajar juntos por un rato, construyendo una división de multimedios poca madre, me emociona muchísimo...  y yo creo que si va a suceder.  ahora el chiste es econtrar el esquema de trabajo poca madre, que nos tenga CONTENTOS a todos, que todo mundo se sienta cómodo con lo que esta haciendo y que eventualmente nos lleve a tener una remuneración económica...  el futuro veo que viene más cerca de lo que esperabamos... ojala podamos manejarlo chido y vernos todos beneficiados... ojala ese lugar de trabajo con el que soñamos, lleno de juguetes, posters, arte conceptual, video-juegos y todas esas cosas sea parte de nuestro quehacer cotidiano más pronto de lo que nos imaginamos...  por otro lado sigo con esa idea, esas ganas de escribir y transmitir "algo"... pero que siempre que quiero sentarme a sacarlo se me escapa... ayer el oscar me dio una buena teoría, que eso sucede cuando hemos aprendido algo nuevo y sentimos muchas ganas de compartirlo, pero aún no tenemos las palabras para poder sacarlo... es tanto un sentimiento irracionalizado que nos cuesta trabajo frasearlo y compartirlo... en teoría eventualmente uno encuentra la manera de racionalizar ese aprendizaje y escribirilo... he he he... en teoría... ojala sea pronto.  y en la tarde pasó algo muy padre en la clase de manejo de energías... hicimos como 3 trabajos de curación, pero dos estuvieron poca madre... es dificil compatir la experiencia porque es un sentimiento... pero fue muy especial, la segunda fue muy fuerte y se sintió una vibración muy muy grande en la que wow...  fue muy fuerte, la señora traía cosas muy duras adentro... pero fue muy especial, hubo canto de mantras y una vibración wow... y la tercera curación fue la onda, en la que pude ver el estilo tan diferente de cada una de las personas, y en la que se sintió una energía de amor y de buena vibra muy especial...  que padre que pude ir a esa clase, siempre me hace sentir muy bien... pensé que no iba a llegar a tiempo porque tenía un cliente en innox, pero curiosamente justo cuando estaba pensando "ya vayase para poder llegar a mi clase!" el mono dijo "oye perdón!, pero me tengo que ir porque tengo una cita a las 7"... ha!!... PERFECTO!!... he he he...  ... bueno... voy a trabajar.

      Walt Disney... escuchas esas dos palabras y piensas en... en que?...  caricaturas... un parque... en blanca nieves, la bella y la bestia y la sirenita... el rey leon... en musica, en fantasía... en el pato donald y "tribilín"... Walt Disney es un nombre que evoca muchas imágenes, sonidos y sonrisas... sentimientos... pero, curiosamente, Walt Disney no hizo nada de eso!!!... su nombre nos evoca todas esas cosas, pero el en realidad no dibujó a la sirenita, ni a tribilín, no animó nada en blanca nieves ni compuso la música de fantasía!!... PERO DE ÉL ES DE QUIEN NOS ACORDAMOS!!...  Walt Disney NO hacía las cosas... pero tuvo un sueño y se rodeo de las personas que eran capaces de volverlo una realidad... Eso quiere decir que el buen Disney no merece crédito?... no... claro que no, merece todo el crédito que tiene hoy en día por haber creado la organización que creó y por lograr tener un nombre a temporal que sobrevive a su muerte y que muy probablemente sobreviva la nuestra... Pero el hecho de que la gente no recuerde a "tyla" a "ollie" o a "frank thomas" (animadores estrella de disney... verdaderos maestros de arte), pero SI recuerden a Disney nos deja una lección poca madre...   hay que ser humildes... hay que ser humildes y darnos cuenta de nuestras limitantes... de saber hasta donde podemos llegar nosotros, y a partir de qué momento necesitamos la ayuda de los demás... disney por ejemplo tenía habilidades de dirección, podía "sketchear" sus ideas en papel, y conocía el lenguaje que hablaban sus artístas... podía comincarse con ellos y mantenerlos a todos en una misma dirección... era un director de orquesta, un cuate con un sueño, y con la habilidad de transmitirles el entusiasmo por su sueño a más personas.  y es que esa es la diferencia entre lo ordinario y lo extraordinario... solos podemos hacer muchas cosas, pero son aquellas cosas que NO podemos hacer solos las que son geniales... las que requieren el apoyo de muchas mas personas y as que nos pegan más duro porque son sueños en conjunto, mucho más ricos que sueños individuales.  los sueños individuales son chidos... y hay nombres de personas que han logrado cosas, por sí mismos, maravillosas... pero recordemos que miguel angel no pinto la capilla sixtina solo... tenía ayudantes... leonardo tenía ayudantes en su taller... edison... todos ellos... no lo hicieron sólos... simplemente su nombre es el que recordamos, porque es su sueño el que se realizó...   a soñar y a realizar... pero sabiendo... que tenemos que invitar a otras personas para que se trepen en nuestro barco... a compartirles nuestro sueño y si tenemos suficiente suerte, a que quieran convertirlo en suyo tambien.  **cheers**

      back in the office...  en realidad necesito hacer ejercicio... por lo que dice la báscula no he subido de peso, pero creo que entre el espejo y la báscula me estan jugando una broma pesada... o nomás no se ponen de acuerdo... tendré que hacerle caso a algo imparcial... quién podrá opinar... el cinturón... tal vez ese... estaré más al tanto de lo que diga el cinturón...  ayer vi una pelicula genial... la de "Boondock District"... una película poca madre de dos hermanos que deciden que es momento de detener tanta maldad y se vuelven una especie de ángeles exterminadores... pero muy graciosos, con una filosofía poca madre, y pues la película es muy muy buena... los personajes tienen una sincera justificación de sus acciones, además de que los "antagónicos" son geniales... sobre todo el investigador "gay" del FBI... buena fotografía, buena edición y excelente soundtrack... y pues la verdad lo mejor tambien fue la compañía... ví la película con el alex, sergio y clarisa, ahi en el depa de clarisa (que esta muy chido)... y fue un momento muy muy agradable... a pesar de mis terriblemente mojados zapatos!.... :oP (estaba lloviendo muy cañon y pues atravesar la calle fue muy complicado... sobre todo traumatizante para mis zapatos)...  ayer platicabamos de la película de office-space... me di cuenta de una cosa... innox no es así!!... POCA MADRE!!... he he he... no quiero nunca caer en eso...  me gustaría eventalmente convertirme en un administrador de proyectos... moviendo a un equipo creativo en una misma dirección... pero más en lo "pensativo" que en lo "operativo" por así decirlo... tengo buenas nociones de diseño, diferentes paquetes y todas esas cosas, pero en realidad sé que hay otras personas que son mejores que yo, en lo operativo, en cada una de las áreas... y es que yo soy tan todólogo y me gusta tanto todo que la especialización tiende a repelerme... y apenas aprendí algo cuando ya quiero brincar a algo nuevo... hasta ahorita eso ha funcionado, pero el punch que le veo es que se hablar muchos idiomas profesionales!... puedo hablar en terminos de diseñadores, progamadores, banda multimedia, desarrolladores en 3D y todas esas cosas... puedo dibujar, hacer sketches y storyboards... sería poca madre que eventualmente tenga proyectos tan grandes que simplemente sobrepasen mis capacidades y tenga que coordinar a un equipo de muchas personas, cada una especializada en un área!!!...  eso me dejaría tiempo a mi para dedicarme a lo que más me gusta... aprender!... y así saber de todo y poder responder dudas a la banda, o trabajar con ellos y con nuevas opciones para llegar a lugares más fregones....  ahhh... que bonito es soñar....  ** desde hace días siento que tengo algo muy importante que escribir... pero en el momento en que me siento a escribirlo "se me escapa"... hay algo en mi cabeza que definitivamente quiero vaciar en este blog, pero no estoy pudiendo... esperemos que salga pronto...

      TOMEN ESO HOMBRES GRISES!!!!!!!!  Ha!!... punto para el padilla... CERO para los hombres grises!!!...  termine con tiempo sobrado lo de la conafor, y poder SIN NINGUN PROBLEMA ir con mis compas hoy en la tarde... HA!!...   he he he... chido... una batalla mas concluida, y de la que salí triunfante... bientos... pero no hay que confiarse... la batalla continua... y así ira siendo cada día... y cada día...  hay tantas cosas que hacer... me dan muchísimas ganas de escribir un libro, leer cientos... dibujar, meterme a clases de cocina, hacer un comic en línea que pueda updatear unas 3 veces por semana, escribir e ilustrar un comic que quiera imprimir alguna editorial, viajar, cotorrear... tantas cosas... tantos proyectos... como decía un día alan... "la vida no pinta a que va a ser aburrida, pinta a que va a ser poco suficiente"...  pero aún así, aunque voy en friega, me gustan mis dias...  cuando recuerdo lo que hice en un día me encanta pensar en muchas cosas y en la manera tan fregona en la que estoy exprimiendo el tiempo... creo que es mejor que no hacer nada, de esta manera voy a tener más cosas que contarle a mis nietos... he he he... y no quiero que mis nietos piensen que su abuelito es un aburrido.  siempre he andado en friega desde hace ya varios años... sobre todo siento que todo comenzó en la carrera... y es que cuando veo las cosas en retrospectiva veo que hize todo lo que quise, anduve en friega pero no me quede con ganas de nada... desde organizar un congreso poca madre hasta ser parte de un equipo que llego a la final en el festival de la canción del tec... teatro, ensambles, intercambio, chamba, buenas calificaciones, buenos compas... creo que he vivido bien mis segundos hasta ahorita...   ahhhh.... relax...  me duele la espalda alta... los musculos de la base del cuello... maldito stress... pero bueno... uno va saliendo...

      No deberia estar escribiendo en este momento...  tengo demasiadas cosas que hacer!!!... pero me hace falta, me hace falta sentarme y desconectarme un ratito a escribir cosas a lo bruto... lo primero que salga...  Acabamos de tener una junta interesante, en la que por primera vez tomamos un "approach" formal de administración de proyectos con fórmulas matemáticas y todas esas cosas que se ven tan impresionantes... y pues básicamente podemos ver que estamos con los tiempos super ajustados, y que el proyecto en el que yo estoy trabajando es el que más urge sacar adelante...  También concluimos que lo que estoy haciendo esta de la burger, y para la otra contratamos a alguién para que lo haga!... más que nada porque tengo que darle formato a 80 pàginas de hmtl, no estoy produciendo nada nuevo mas que página tras página de talacha, y la neta es que estoy perdiendo demasiado tiempo en algo repetitivo, tiempo que debería dedicarle a rollos de verdadera producicón intelectual... y pues por eso podríamos pagarle a alguién... ya que además de generar empleo y rolar chamba, vamos a poder aprovechar más nuestro tiempo en otras cosas...  Esto de innox esta siendo en verdad una experiencia interesante... aunque me duelen horrible el cuello y los hombros... he he he... así que por lo visto también esta resultando muy pesada... como he platicado con clarissa, hay que ser capaces de darnos tiempo para nosotros mismos!... hay que acordarse de la importancia de ser felices y de que esta vida es, en realidad, para la felicidad... por eso me gusto tanto un mail que mando el buen felix, que decía que a lo largo de nuestra vida nos la pasamos malabareando 5 esferas:la familia, los amigos, el trabajo, el espíritu,  y la salud... la esfera del trabajo es de plastico, así que si se nos cae rebota y podemos volver a meterla en el juego de una u otra manera... pero las otras son de vidrio, y si se caen se agrietan... se rompen... y ya jamás puedes hacer que estén como estuvieron en un principio...   hay que preocuparse por esas otras esferas... todas... siendo el trabajo importante, más no lo mas importante... aunque desgraciadamente a veces nos absorve dusísimo...  **aprendiendo a vivir**  me tendré que poner a trabajar ya?.... yo creo que sí...  ni siquiera puedo pensar bien por tan embotada que traigo la mente con mil cosas más.

      "en realidad no cambianos a lo largo de la vida... simplemente nos vamos convirtiendo más plenamente en quien en verdad somos"... interesante... sobre todo porque el "hector padilla" de la prepa era otro al de la primaria, completamente diferente al del kinder y nada que ver con el de la secundaria... que cura... y yo siento que sí he cambiado mucho... muchísimo de hecho... y que chido que a vida me ha dado tantas lecciones!!... solo que esa frase me pone a pensar... "he cambiado?"... o simplemente me estoy acercando cada día más a convertirme en quien en verdad soy?...   aqui es donde entran en conflicto varias filosofias yo creo... desde cosas como la tabula raza o el ciclo "samsara" de los budistas... es decir, nos vamos construyendo con el tiempo?... poco a poco "moldeando" nuestra escultura comenzando desde cero?... o más bien, con el tiempo, nos vamos "purificando" y acercando a la iluminaicón?, permitiendo que así salga el ser que en verdad somos pero esta tapado en tanta basura y confusion... creo que esa frase que leí hoy en la mañana se acerca más a la 2da teoría... la "budistoide"... he he he...  creo que ambas posturas son tan válidas como cualquier cosa... sobre todo porque aqui lo divertido es que nadie sabe nada y todo son sólo teorías e ideas... y lo que importa es cuál teoría puede responder la mayor cantidad de preguntas sin caerse... aunque eso sí, no creo que ninguna tenga la respuesta a la última pregunta... la que responderá todo... he he he... sobre todo porque nosotros ni siquiera sabemos en realidad cuál es la pregunta...   tra la ra... tengo sueño... me voy a poner a trabajar o algo!!...   esta semana ha sido demasiado llena de actividades... desde el lunes que no paramos, pero poca madre... buenas charlas con el oscar y erik... buenos compañeros de viaje con los que creo que voy a poder llegar lejos en un sueño compartido... :-D ahhh... y pues ayer fui a despedirme el buen gabo... la verdad fue medio triste... un buen amigo, no conviví tanto con él como me hubiera gustado pero suficiente para darme cuenta de lo chido que es... un tipo que me enseñó muchisimas cosas!!... yo creo que muchas más de las que el se imagina... sus palabras tuvieron un impacto importante en mi vida... y no me refiero a las buenas clases de magic!!... me refiero a las buenas clases de vida y esas charlas de cafe... a las "habladas de mujeres y traiciones" y a los miedos... buenas pláticas... espero que esa despedida haya sido solo un hasta luego... :-S  ** suerte gabo...

      Hoy en la mañana íbamos al tec cuando note, en varios lugares, anuncios, revistas, y cosas asi, MUCHAS COSAS ASI, con ondas que tenían que ver con el sexo, y ondas eróticas... portadas, imagenes de mujeres seductoras, de hombres y grupos de personas "divirtiéndose" en fiestas de esas "sudadas" y llenas de alcohol... he he he... y pues imágenes de ese tipo... y me hicieron reír mucho, y pensar bastante en un libro que estoy leyendo... muy bueno por cierto... y es que porqué tan exagerado el recurso del sexo en la publicidad y los medios de mercadeo?!... PUES TIENE MUCHO SENTIDO!!!...  Nosotros somos individuos, personas, cada uno de nosotros... que, a final de cuentas, estamos "movidos" por emociones... nuestras ambiciones, sueños, y todo, estan motivados por aquellos sentimientos que anhelamos sentir, y aquellos que nos gusta sentir... queremos "poder", "satisfaccion", "felicidad"... y a final de cuenta todas las cosas que hacemos, los rollos por los que trabajamos, lo que compramos, TODO, lo hacemos porque nos mueve un sentimiento, una ambición... algo "primal" que buscamos siempre y que nos hace hacer las cosas.   Así, animales como somos, necesitamos motivaciones que nos pegen en deseos, en necesidades que nos muevan y el "marketing" obviamente utiliza ese recurso... tratando de pegarnos en nuestros sentimeintos y motivaciones más básicas... la necesidad de seguridad, la necesidad de amor, de aceptación... etc... pero hay UNA necesidad, un deseo, que esta en todos lados... que todos, hombres y mujeres, tenemos, y esa es obviamente la de la sensualidad y pues: el sexo... una cosa es que nos hayan educado para "negarlo", pensar que esta mal, y lo que sea... pero definitivamente esta en la mente de todos, y por lo menos en secreto es algo que, definitivamente nos mueve cañon... y por eso el sexo esta en todos lados, porque los mercadólogos saben que eso le pega a uno de los instintos más primales y más innegables de todo ser humano, y tienen que hacer uso de ese recurso para movernos... para hacernos comprarles... y todo porque?... porque hay perdido una cosa muy valiosa...  ha perdidio el contacto con la gente... las verdaderas conversaciones... el verdadero "mercado" aquel que comenzó hace miles de años donde la gente iba a hablar con la gente, a intercambiar historias, a ver al alfarero, los animales exótivos de continentes recién conocidos, ese mercado original donde la gente veía a a gente... y los negocios eran entre PERSONAS... hoy en día el mercado es una entidad abstracta rara que "sabemos que existe" y los mercados son "demographic targets" y cosas asi, donde al final la gente que vende nunca tiene contanto con al que compra, y viceversa....  sí.... lo sensual y sexual toca uno de nuestros instintos más "primales", mas básicos, más animales... PERO se han olvidado de uno de los instintos más importantes, probablemente más trascendente que el sexual, y el que nos convierte en humanos... la necesidad de COMUNICARNOS!!... de expresarnos, de compartir, de soñar.... ESA es la necesidad que no cubren los mercadologos con todas sus campañas publicitarias en masa, porque NO le pegan a la necesidad que tenemos CADA INDIVIDUO de ser INDIVIDUOS!!...   por eso le pegan a esa necesidad tan coleciva y tan animal... la sexual... porque han perdido el verdadero contacto con las personas, con MI persona... los que me venden no me conocen, no me escuchan, y al final de cuentas yo NO conosco al que me vende... no lo escucho.... por eso hay tantas personas que van a expos y eventos donde participan autores de libros, personajes que van a contarnos historias en vivo y que por un instante dejan de ser "el autor" y se convierte en una persona que nos esta contando una historia... una historia para mi!!...  si la mercadotecnia encontrara la manera de pegarle a ESA necesidad nuestra se sentiría mas sincera, más fuerte, imactaría más y la hariamos mas nuestra...  así le pegarían a MI necesidad de ser persona... de soñar, de que me escuchen y de escuchar... a mi capacidad de asombro y de trascender!... no al animal ese dentro de todos... que aunque es fuerte, no es yo... yo soy más que mi cuerpo y sus necesidades... YO soy el que SOY... más alla de un caparazón....  **cheers**

      argh!... tengo la mente toda vuelta loca...  esta mañana han estado pasando demasiadas cosas en la oficina!!!... he he he... muy raro y molesto, pero chido... es como raro, no me molesta, pero si me trae todo ido... es triste, en lo que respecta a este blog, porque mientras manejaba hacia aca estaba muy inspirado y tenía muchas ganas de escribir varias cosas en esta cosa... y siento que todas tenían mucho sentido y eran muy buenas... he he he... mal plan.  ahorita me voy a poner a respaldar mil cosas, y pronto comeré, espero que el "sueño post-comida" me ayude para inspirarme y me permita recordar lo que quería escribir en el buen blog... he he he... para asi poder poner algo mas o menos interesante...

      otra semana!!... ahhhh... por lo menos este fin de semana si fue de relax... y sí, definitivamente tengo una parte de mi "motor interior" que corre "obsesion based"... creo que esa parte no va a descansar hasta que tenga una iBook o una PowerBook... creo que la iBook es mejor opcion, es más de batalla por los reviews que estuve leyendo, pero es g3... o sea que quien sabe... chance y mejor nos esperamos para una PowerBook... se me hace mas importante que una palm, en realidad no creo necesitar tanto esas cosas... aunque sí, defintivamente podría usar una.  anyway... comenzando la semana con muchos proyectos y mucha chamba... eso me da muchísimo punch... y curiosamente comencé tambien la semana con un mail interesante, un mail del pedrolas que me hizo recordad muchas cosas... pedro es un cuate con el que vivi muchas cosas por ahí de la primera mitad de la carrera, un muy buen amigo y compañero de muchas aventuras... he he he... me acuerdo y me da mucha risa... desde entrenamientos de kung fu hasta buenos relajos en vallarta, serenatas y muchas cosas más... me puso a pensar y un poco melancólico... la vida va y viene, y nos pone a personas muy interesantes para compartir ciertos instantes... lo dificil es cuando en una de esas idas la vida te aleja de esas personas, o esas personas se alejan de tí... todo es un cambio, todo es una metamorfósis y obviamente llegan nuevos instantes y nuevos compañeros de vida... pero esas sonrisas que evoca el pasado no se van, y darían ganas de que se queden junto con todas esas cosas nuevas que van llegando...  sería padre un reencuentro con el pedro y estos weyes... un buen cotorreo porque la neta es un capítulo de mi vida que me gusta mucho "releer" y sería fregón saber que ha pasado de "la banda" en todo este tiempo... creo que el distanciamiento comenzó un poco cuando el buen pedro y chris se fueron a puerto rico... y por ahi de esas fechas comenzamos a tomar caminos diferentes...   sabe...  bueno, me voy a poner a darle unos últimos ajustes al sistema de cargolet...  **cheers por la nueva semana!**

      C'est la vie... asi se escribe?.. así es la vida?...  acabo de ver animatrix... hubo una frase que me impactó: "entonces soñar te hace conocer la existencia de la realidad?.... - no, me hace conocer la existencia de mi mente, de todo lo demás no estoy segura"...  wow... que rollo tan fregon y filosofico presenta esa serie de cortos animados, y es que yo creo que todos nosotros hemos sentido eso, esa "irrealidad" del mundo que nos rodea y esa sencación de que la neta, algo esta mal o algo hace falta para que todo esto tenga sentido... y vienen y te ponen una película así y te quedas woooow... no es el "ultimo tratado filosofico" sobre la vida el universo y todo lo demás... digo, al final de cuentas no dice nada respecto al 42... pero se acerca a una teoría muy interesante, y pues basada tembién en filosofías básicamente orientales...  filosofías que no necesariamente contradicen un libro que he estado estudiando ultimamente, el kybalión, donde se habla de la naturaleza mental del universo, del TODO, y donde, a partir de un verdadero entendimiento de ese concepto, nos podemos convertir en verdaderos magos, ya que entendemos que TODO es una creación mental, y si nuestra mente vibra con más consciencia y de manera superior a la de la "realidad común" podemos afectarla, y hacer "milagros"... y tantas de esas cosas... como por ejemplo, las que hace Neo en "the matrix" o lo que han hecho personas mas aceptadas como reales, por ejemplo Jesús y Sidharta Gautama.  Son cosas que parecieran tener mucho sentido... pero que obviamente aun se me escapan muuucho conceptos, sin embargo el hecho de que la mente mas consciente controla la mas dormida, y de que conforme conoces las leyes puedes comenzar a utilizarlas a tu favor tiene mucho sentido... pero vaya... podré escribir más al respecto conforme vaya entendiendo más...   por otro lado... veo y siento que una parte de mi "motor personal" se mueve y es motivado por "obsesiones"... fijaciones de cosas que quiero lograr y que me clavo durísimo hasta lograr... a veces una vez que cumplo la meta llego a un estado anticlimático en el que, me doy cuenta, que la motivación por tener algo generaba más satisfacción que tenerlo... he he he... por lo tanto voy por otra meta... ahora siento que se me esta formando una nueva obsesión... bueno varias, pero una material, me estoy clavando con la idea de una mac, una laptop macintosh, para tenerla y para mis hobbies... rollos de arte, dibujar, photoshop, comic en linea y tantas cosas por el estilo... asi rico, agusto...   pero ese va a tomarme un poco más de tiempo yo creo... y junto con esa, y la necesidad del carro, yo creo que ahi la llevamos.  oh pues... seguimos en búsqueda.

      ultimamente no he estado muy bien... o mas bien he andado muy saturado al verdad... como que siento que casi no tengo tiempo de hacer todo lo que en verdad quisiera estar haciendo... malditio libro de vampiros...  no porque quiera ser vampiro ni vivir miles de años, pero porque el hecho de que me la he pasado en friega hace que NO pueda leerlo, y en realidad quisiera pasarmela un dia tirado leyendolo todo!!... y mas cosas, tengo videos que ver, y tantas ganas de salir a N lugares... pero lo malo es que la lana tambien esta escaseando...  innox?...  va bien... va poca madre de hecho y creciendo... aun no se ven resultado$ pero estoy seguro de que habra... y pues ya estoy delegando responsabilidades y logrando compartir este sueño con dos personas que, ojala, se pongan chido la camiseta y le den con todo a este sueño!... el buen oscar y el buen erik... que poca madre sería poder trabajar con ellos. Aqui lo dificil más bien es tanta talacha, tanta operación y que me comen los detallitos tontos... erik por ejemplo va a hacer algo poca madre en flash, pero poca madre de neta!!!... y yo?... editando htmls a lo wey... ni siquiera diseñando... me gusta, y me gusta que el haga algo chido para que este mas motivado, y pues la neta alguien tiene que hacer la chamba tediosa y pues como buen martir me la pongo yo... :-D  solo soñando... si tuviera toda la lana del mundo?... me la pasaria en rollos de arte definitivamente... dibujando poca madre e illustrando... nada mas... diseñando cosas, pero no creo que haciendo rollos de código... a lo mucho códigos experimetanles de esos bien locos en flash... y la verdad es que no tengo porque estar tan lejos de ese sueño... de pasarmela haciendo esas cosas... (de estar asquerosamente rico yo creo que si... he he he... habra que esperar mas para eso)... pero la neta el sueño de pasarmelo "trazando" esta bien chido...  y la verdad es que todo trabajo tiene sus "ups" and "downs" y obviamente aqui en innox no todo es trabajo glamuroso... hay mucha operacion de hueva... y esa hay que hacerla... pero tambien se que no quiero hacerla siempre... es chistoso sobre todo porque sé que no hay otro lugar donde prefiriera estar trabajando... puedo pensar en el cite la neta, pero el cite siempre es el cite y despues de 5 años creo que necesito romper el cordon umbilical y evolucionar... salir de esa comodidad y brincar a un estado de reto como en el que me encuentro.  ----  el martes pasado tuve una muy chida charla con el báldes y el hector luis en la paloma, de esas que duran horas y que hablamos de mil rollos... mucho del "amor en tiempos de cólera" y las relaciones con parejas... el hector esta pasando por una etapa dura, de mucho cambio, y pues que chido que la haya compartido con nosotros... de ahi en mas puras mensadas y muchas de esas cosas que solo con alguien como ellos se pueden platicar...  sobre todo me dio mucho gusto el cotorreo con enrique... ya que es al que mas siento alejando, y me alegra ver que sigue ahi, igual que siempre, a pesar de todo y durante tanto tiempo....  ** a darle **

      ya estoy utilizando el mozilla "firebird"... veamos que tal se dan las cosas... una de las cosas más molestas de cambiar de navegador de internet es que se pierden todos los favoritos y todas esas cosas a las que uno se ha acostumbrado... ciertas cosas que uno ya ha llegado a esperar de su navegador y que derrepente "pum"!... se van... ya no estan... y hay que volveeer a empezar. Pero bueno.... he he he... creo que no es tan dramática la situación, además de que tengo un presentimiento de que el firebird y yo nos vamos a llevar bien. :-)  tenía tiempo que no leía una novela, había estado leyendo libros de ensayos, ondas de filosofía o negocios, rollos más bien teoricones... y había olvidado la sensación de no poder dormir porque simplemente NECESITAS SEGUIR LEYENDO!!!...  **** despues de una pausa de 15 minutos **** (me entretuve un poco leyendo el blog de jenny-girl y viendo algunas fotos de su sitio... )  SI!!... NECESITAS SEGUIR LEYENDO!!.... he he he... estoy leyendo "The Queen of the Damned"... y la verdad si me esta interesando bastante, hace que todo el setting de vampiros y las ganas de armar un juego así sean mas fuertes, y sobre todo me pone a penar... me pone a pensar en que la vida es DEMASIADO CORTA!!!... no es que quiera ser vampiro, ni que me hagan... he he he... pero el hecho de que esos cuates, de acuerdo al libro, han vivido y visto a la humanidad por cientos de años crea en mí una especie de melancolía y de envidia...  tantas cosas por ver y que no voy a poder ver!... tantas cosas por hacer, lugares por visitiar... y aunque tuviera todo el dinero del mundo para simplemente dedicarme a mis hobbies siento que NO podría hacer todas esas cosas... no tendría el tiempo y siempre, hacía el final de mi vida, sentiría que no pude hacer todo lo que quería... no es que sea demasiado egosísta ni ambicioso ni nada así... es que simplemente tengo demasiadas ambiciones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....  ARGH!!!!... falta de enfoque en la vida?... no creo... digamos simplemente que mi lente enfoca demasiadas cosas!...  es eso demasiado malo?... querer muchas cosas?...  eso sí... el chiste es no olvidarme de algo... ESTOY AQUI... AHORITA... quien sabe mañana... y todos esos sueños no deben de hacer que no disfrute lo de ahorita... esas añoranzas pueden lastimar. Pero no, no creo que me lastimen, creo que más bien me motivan... es solo que ese libro me pone a pensar de tantas cosas que hay en este mundo, y tantas cosas que habrá... de las que, de seguro y tristemente, me voy a peder... pero bueno, por lo menos debo de hacer las cosas que SI viva, y las experiencias que SI tenga valgan la pena... a ver si así, al final de mi vida, puedo decir "gracias... buenas noches... fue suficiente y ahora ya puedo dormir"...  **cheers**

      el otro dia vi la buena pelicula de thomb-raider!... he he he... muy buena... bueno... la neta no es muy buena, pero es de esas que te entretienen y hacen que te diviertas un buen rato... tipo la de los angeles de charly y todas esas. Angelina Jolie es una mujer sumamente sexy, pero que curiosa la charla al final de la película en la que todos coincidiamos que en "no nos latía tanto"... porque sí, es como que MUY sexy... MUY MUY sexy... pero solamente eso... sexy... pero ya... como que no ofrece mas... es raro... no le puedes poner ningun pero pero no acaba de atraparte.  anyway... la salida estuvo muy chida, fuimos el sergio, clarisa, alex, jorge y yo... estuvo chido en el cine y despues nos fuimos un rato a una buena charla de cafe. En el cafe platique muy padre con jorge... desgraciadamente se polarizó la conversación y no pude charlar con los demás, pero el jorge tenía muchas cosas que compartir de su carrera y muchas presiones... es doctor y pronto va a tener su examen de residencia!!... fue una buena charla, y pues hasta me ofrecí a darle una terapia de reiki para ver si lo relajaba... no estaba seguro de que fuera a interesarle, digo un "doctor alopata" como que esta peleado con esas cosas... pero chido!... si me hablo y le di una terapia esta domingo pasado. ayer... espero que le haya ayudado, yo siento que sí.  lo interesante es la idea que he traido en la cabeza desde que vi la pelicula... y unas conecciones que hice entre la película, una charla con pepe, y el libro que estoy leyendo de vampiro... sobre la importancia del arte y los trascendente que es en la vida de nosotros  en realidad aquello que trasciende, lo que nos hace recordar y que impacta en nuestra vida, tiene mucho que ver con cosas artísticas. Un buen libro, una pintura, un poema o incluso un video'juego con un arte poca madre y una tematica muy chida... son cosas que te impresionan en el corazon, en lo sentimental, y que dejan una parte muy importante de sí en tu persona...  espero algún día poder escribir un buen libro, o lograr impacto de esa manera... todo tiene que ver con esa idea de trascender y de llegar a se mas... de vivir más allá de nuestra propia muerte donde nuestra obra y vida impacten tanto a otras personas que simplemente sigamos existiendo más alla de nosotros mismos.  sería chido...   pd. la meta es una iMax, 2,348.00 dolares... ya que la tenga en ella hare el comic en linea... he he he... alguien quiere cooperar?!... :-P

      y asi derrepente me quede dormido... no se cuanto tiempo paso... tal vez fue mucho, muchíiiisimo... o muy poquito... pero fue suficiente... aqui siempre todo es suficiente... cuando dormi estaba en alguna calle creo, pero ahora despierto a la sombra de este rico arbol... justo donde queria despertar!!... el arbol esta chido, muuuy grande... frondoso... da una sombra muy rica y deja ver un poco el cielo... hey!... hay una nube muy chida pasando por ahi arriba!... creo que parece un dragon!!... o sera un dragon?... hey arbol!!... quitate!!!... dejame ver!!... HA!!... ya se fue el arbol... he he he... si... ya era hora de que se fuera... ahora puedo ver mejor... woooooow... eso debio ser un dragon...  camino por un rato... el sol esta arriba, pero no quema ni calienta... y la cantidad de nubes es perfecta... el dragon ya se fue, pero algo me asegura que lo voy a estar viendo muy seguido... he he he... ha de ser un buen amigo.   hablando de amigos ahi hay varios!!... tomando un buen cafe en esa terracita... que rico... voy y tengo una charla excelente con ellos... de todas esas cosas que siempre charlamos y que, aún ahorita, en verdad no podemos entender muy bien. Es curioso... se que estan aqui, y que en realidad disfrutan esta conversación... pero al mismo tiempo se que tenían intereses muy diferentes a los mios, y muchas ganas de muchas otras cosas... estan aqui charlando, yo se... pero de seguro tambien estan en otros lados haciendo muchas otras cosas interesantes mientras esta charla sucede... me pregunto en cuantos lados estare yo?... y que tan consciente estare de que estoy en muchos otros lados?... a que loco!... lo bueno es que no veo todo lo que estoy haciendo al mismo tiempo.... estaria muy confundido!!... ya sera mi bronca en cada lugar el gozar esa experiencia... he he he... me deseo suerte donde sea que este...  hey!... voy a volar un rato... y despues pintar y esculpir algo divertido con esa montaña... y la montaña?... he he he... ahi esta!... se escondía por un rato... pero primero, a volar... si... voy a encontrar ese dragon, tengo un muy buen chiste que contarle y a los dragones de por aqui les encantan los chistes.. he he he...  que loco es esto de estar muerto... ta' chido... lo mas chido es acordarme de todo lo que vivi, durante todas esas vidas!... ahh!... como he estado tan tonto... por ahora estoy bien... asi... sería bueno intentarlo de nuevo?.... siempre hay algo que aprender.... he he he... pero no... ahorita no, tengo que encontrar a ese dragon antes de que se me olvide el chiste.  cual chiste?.... argh!... he he he... oh pues... "genio y figura hasta en la sepultura"....  **cheers

      mi pancita "finally" no esta taaaaan mal... es mas o menos un campo minado, aun siento que es un terreno peligroso, medio radioactivo, que pareciera comportarse de maneras inesperadas cada "x" tiempo... pero ya, esta calmado... el lunes en la noche fue terrible!!... terrible en todos los sentidos de la palabra!!!... pero por eso valoro tanto como me siento ahorita... "medio inestable" pero ya sin explosiones constantes... he he he.... ahh que loco...  lo chido es que todo esto me permitio "tomarme" la mañana de ayer para recuperarme, y me dio chance de leer "nausicaa of the valley of the wind".... y esta POCA MADRE!!... es una novela grafica de hayao miyazaki, un autor y director muy bueno japones, que tiene en su portafolios proyectos como "mononoke hime", "laputa" y el muy sonado "spirited away" que gano un oscar por animacion en esta entrega de oscares pasadas... bla bla bla... Bueno, lo chido de esta novela grafica es que, ademas de que te pica cañon y no puedes dejar de leerla, es que es una crítica muy interesante al comportamiento del ser humano con el ser humano mismo, y con su entorno...   el "divertido" hecho de que somos tan caníbales y nos encanta tanto jodernos entre nosotros.... luchas de poder, guerras... queremos más, más y más, mas territorio... y tantas cosas tontas que hacen que se nos olvide que, al final de cuentas, lo que en verdad queremos en más felicidad y mayor plenitud... se nos olvida ayudarnos entre nosotros, y pues mejor nos matamos... y de paso nos llevamos a la naturaleza claro, digo, sino la voy a poder gozar yo, mejor que nadie la goce!!... no?... y asi... entre egoismos, envídias y avaricias ha ido avanzando la raza humana hasta su autodestrucción y la destrucción de su planeta... que divertido!!... yay!...  ehem... pero si... mas o menos el comic tiene que ver con todo esto... y obviamente con la gente que "es buena" y quiere que las cosas sean diferentes... nausicaa siendo una niña muy especial... una de esas niñas...   y ahora que lo pienso, de las 3 o 4 cosas que puedo recordar de miyazaki justo ahorita, ese es un tema medio recurrente... el compa es muy crítico de nuestra manera de vivir, pero al mismo tiempo muy propositivo planteando un pensamiento más sano para nosotros y nuestro entorno...  ..... por otro lado vi "if I see you in my dreams" ... me puso mucho a pensar... el anime es bueno, muuuuuuy desesperante... pero bueno... y la verdad es que, aunque me gusto mucho que hubo un final feliz para los personajes "principales", me puso triste la situación de una niña que se llama hamaoke... digamos que las camaras siempre siguieron la historia de un par de personajes, pero si en lugar de eso hubieran seguido a hamaoke las cosas hubieran sido muy diferentes... y el final hubiera sido muy triste...  y eso pasa con el amor... es la cosa mas bonita del mundo para los que terminan amados, y para quienes su "cuento de hadas" se cumple... aunque sea por un ratito... pero todas esas personas que quedan lastimadas en el camino?... todas esas historias de un amor no correspondido?... no manchen... a mi me daban ganas de brincar y pedirle a hamaoke que saliera conmigo!... una niña toda tierna, toda chida, encantada con un monito... y este wey nada!... clavado con otra... se respeta... de hecho, pensandolo bien, son cosas que he vivido... pero aún así es MUY triste... porque?!... porque la gente se enamora de quienes no les pueden corresponder?!...  porque tiene que haber tantas historias tristes y corazones rotos en esto del amor?...   argh!... ya me dio coraje otra vez... pobre hamaoke...  **bye

      la semana ha sido buena... aquellos "forecast" del lunes terminaron siendo ciertos, hay muchas oportunidades en puerta interesantes para innox, he estado leyendo buenos libros y comics, y el cotorreo en general va bien... hoy voy a comenzar el curso oficial de capacitacion de "lightwave", y aunque yo no voy a certificarme pues si voy a poder asistir a todas las clases y aprender todo el material... lo cual es lo que en verdad me importa... :-D  sin embargo, aunque hay muchos motivos para sonreir, justo ahorita estoy un poco hastiado y no me late... y es que no deja de darme vueltas en la cabeza una discusion/charla que sucedio ayer con mis papas... no se cual sea el problema aqui, y probablemente hay ingredientes "destructivos" en las dos partes... pero basicamente ellos se quejan de la falta de comunicacion de mi parte hacia ellos, pero ayer que se me ocurrio pedirles un favor chiquito y abrir la boca eso desato dos horas de cuestionamientos, regaños, y reproches muy molestos... entiendo que se preocupen por mi y por las decisiones que estoy tomando en mi vida... el rollo en innox y todas esas cosas... lo entiendo y hasta es chido ver que se preocupan por mi.... pero me molesta MUCHO que ajeren de esa manera y esten cuestionando tantiiiiisimo todo lo que yo estoy haciendo... creo que a ellos les hace falta ver que ya no controlan mi vida ni mis decisiones... no se...   esta siendo un proceso dificil para todos... es un cambio grande y fuerte... pero mis papas tienen que agarrar la onda, y sobre todo, PERMITIRME COMETER MIS PROPIOS ERRORES... si... regarla, caerme del caballo, darme de topes y DEJARME aprender en el proceso...   es lo unico que me gustaria... que me permitan regarla, cometer mis errores y vivir con sus consecuencias... pero yo... a mi... y ya... es suficiente problema mi consciencia y mi manera estricta de ver mi actuar, para ademas sumarle el juicio constante de mis papas... eso en realidad complica las cosas y la vida, mi estado de animo. puedo vivir con mis errores y sus consecuencias, pero se hace muy pesado vivir bajo esa lupa de vez en cuando.  --- ahora lleno de dudas y ajeres mentales tengo que ponerme las pilas, sacurdirme SUS miedos y vivir con una sonrisa este dia... que la neta, no tiene la culpa de lo que paso ayer asi que se merece un buen trato...  ** cheers **

      ayer, martes, nos quedamos como hasta las 10 y media en innox... he he he... pero esta vez jugando!!... hay un juego chidisimo de la comunidad open source que se llama "armagetron" y los instalamos en todas las maquinas para jugar un multiplayer muy bueno!... es como el juego de las motos de tron, de hecho, es basado en ese juego... y todo mundo sabe lo que es tron!!... vdd?... he he he...  ademas de que fue muy divertido, y de que yo perdia con mucha facilidad, he he he, fue muy bueno para todos nosotros ya que nos estamos dando cuenta de que estamos trabajando mucho, pero nos hace falta convivir con nosotros en actividades "extras"... conocernos más y hacernos más amigos... incluso puede que hagamos un viaje de fin de semana para ese fin, y es que a final de cuentas somos personas, y entre nosotros, los socios, somos las personas con las que mas convivimos y compartimos... queremos encontrar maneras de compartir nuestros sueños y metas, y de lograr que los sueños de cada quien se reflejen en la vida de innox, en el dia de trabajo normal... definir nuestra mision en terminos de como nos queremos sentir cuando vengamos a trabajar... estar ahi siempre para apoyarnos COMO PERSONAS y sentirnos amigos... eso es chido...  y es que existe el curioso fenomeno de la motivacion,  que se parece a una funcion senoidal, sube y baja con el tiempo, y debemos de encontrar todo aquello que nos mantiene juntos y con animos para que, cuando cada uno de nosotros estemos pasando por uno de esos "bajos" podamos ayudarlo y todos salir juntos...  a mi me ha pasado... aqui mismo y en estos 3 meses he pensado que probablemente esto no es lo que quiero... pero despues de pensar un poco mas me doy cuenta de que la neta si!... he he he... y es que la mente humana trabaja de manera muy chistosa, y nuestros motivadores y todas esas cosas se activan por cosas muy sencillas... no se... la mente humana es de lo mas rara...   los procesos del pensamiento son unas de las cosas que menos entendemos!... como pensamos?... como se generan las ideas?... como es que nuestra mente procesa toda esa informacion que le llega de tantas fuentes de manera simultanea?... por eso es tan divertido el concepto de "inteligencia artificial" y de las "maquinas pensantes"... se quiere simular y lograr un ser artificial pensante, pero ese proceso que queremos simular es el que menos entendemos!!!... como queremos crear una maquina inteligente si, ni siquiera, entendemos de verdad el proceso de pensamiento y de inteligencia en nosotros mismos!?!...   hay un libro, "phantoms in the brain", que te pone a pensar mucho en todas estas cosas... es un libro de neurologia que plantea muchas preguntas sobre como funciona nuestro cerebro, y plantea muchas teorias y enseñanzas en base a casos "interesantes" de personas a las que se les ha atrofiado alguna funcion en el cerebro... gracias a esas "averias" en algunas personas, se pueden estudiar un poco mas los procesos y la manera en la que estos funcionan... pero si acaso se generan cada vez mas preguntas y se da uno cuenta de lo poco que sabemos de nuestra mente...  hmmm.... como llegue a este tema?... he he he...  "spaguetti cerebral!!"...

      es lunes y esta siendo un buen dia... ya son las 9 y 12 de la noche, y estamos todos en innox trabajando y no podemos parar de reir... las sonrisas estan por todos lados, buenas carcajadas las del yanqui y es memorable verlo bailar cuando sono "beat it" por mis bocinas...   fin de semana riquisimo... anime y game fest... buenos juegos de hacky y algo de ejercicio... la vida sigue adelante y adelante el cotorreo...   si... se siente bien... es el principio de la semana y algo, no se que, me dice que va a ser buena...

      entonces... como han estado las cosas?...  es triste que haya, de nuevo, deja de escribir por tanto tiempo en este blog... y mas triste es darme cuenta que, curiosamente, cuando no puedo escribir es cuando mas cosas que contar tendria...  espero regresar pronto, y hacer algun resumen de todo lo que esta pasando por mi vida... por lo pronto una disculpa a mis recuerdos aqui escritos, no los he olvidado, y otra disculpa a las memorias y pensamientos que no he podido plasmar en este blog... se me merecen su espacio y ojala pueda darselos pronto.

      hace mucho que no escribo... tanto de hecho que, latilde.com, ha dejado de existir... no tuve dinero para pagarla!!... Y ahora, en lugar de eso, pues utiizamos el espacio gratuito que blogger.com amablemente nos ofrece...  bueno... hoy no voy a escribir sobre mi vida ni como me siento... para eso le dedico tiempo mejor despues...  hoy voy a escribir una idea que no quiero perder... que me hace sentir lleno, iluminado... y wow...  creo que puede girar el enfoque de las cosas en mi vida...  asi como hace poco, platicando con daniel, descrubri que me entusiasmaba el proceso de "crear" una empresa... más no el de vivir en una... así acabo, derrepente, de sentir que lo mio esta en los "do thats"... quiero vivir de "do thats"... crear "do thats"... QUIERO SER UN CREADOR DE DO THATS!!!!...  esa idea me gusta... en realidad me hace sonreir...  merece explicacion, pero sera en otra ocasión... por lo pronto esta es una entrada egoista, porque solo yo la entiendo... pero es para eso, para no perder la idea... para fotografiar el sentimiento.

      Sometimes something weird happens to me... I say stuff, or so I think, and then... for some reason... I feel like the words were never spoken... that they were never on the air... it's not like nobody listened... When you say something, and the words are not heard, they are still there... in the air... you feel how your mouth did let them go away... how your tongue articulated them...  But in those odd times you almost think that... I don't know... you thought so much of saying it, that somehow your braind built up the memory of how those words would sound and all... but yet you could swear they were just a thought...  that your mouth didn't even move a bit...  The words do echo in your mind... but somehow they do not in the "real" world... and then sometimes you feel to ackward as to ask around something like "hey... did I say this?"... because sometimes it's even worse... you "say" something.. "someone" responds... but you feel the same... like probably it was made up in a weird way by your brain.... because the sounds in your mind just don't seem real...  and you cannot really see them in the real world... it's like they traveled some place weird...   ...  it freaks me out... and it happened several times today...   did I have a "word-stealer" close to me?... hmmm.... I haven't heard of those guys before.... but that could explain things...  by the way... I fell... I couldn't stop my self and ended up buying comics... he he he... oh well... go me!

      how many comic books could I afford with out destroying my economy for the next two months?... Jeziel just called to say that comic castle had discounts of over 50% on some of their stuff... I knew they where going to have discounts, I just decided to stay away from them though, because my income is rather inconsistent latelly... but 50%... man... how can you let that pass?...  and now... comics aren't just for fun... at least not to me... they are an "investment"... latelly I spend minutes on each page, analyzing all of it... how they inked it, the wording... trying to imagine how I would color that and all... and it's because I am seriously trying to get into this business and get stuff published... that's pretty much the reason of  urlLink KaraoKulta  to exist... to ilustrate and publish comics...   so... if I am serious about this thing... then... buying a comic would be an investment right? and taking advantage of the discounts would just be convenient right?... ... so... if I don't go buy some stuff, I would be actually going against my dream right?...  so that's it... I have to buy some... it's just like that!  .... he he he.... now I am trying to convince my self... it isn't really working...   I guess I'll end up buying some just because I am a shop-a-holic and need the comics... period... no better reason than to satisfy my geeky needs...  now to work, let's see how the day goes...

      As we were driving on the way home I thought of something great... I just had a brilliant idea, one of those that I was sure would "read" great once it's written, and I was as well terribly excited about writing it... Then reality hit me and I had to tag alone with my father and my brother, wait as they had their haircuts done and all... wasted quite some time... I actually did draw a little... but nothing great.   Anyway... once I got home... that great idea had vanished... and I hate it!... I can't stop thinking about what the freak it  was that I thought of!!!!... and it's killing me... kind of in those times in which you know the face of the actor, you've  seen the guy in quite some movies, but your brain still manages to block his name and there's no force on earth that will make it come to surface... yet you crave to find it... remmeber it... but nothing... frustrated as you get you are forced to "forget about it" and move on... still, eventually something happens that makes you remember it for some odd reason, and then... only then... you can finally give clossure to that matter.  I am afraid something like that will happen here...   actually... me being writting all this is a symptom... it's just me struggling to remember that bright idea...   hmmm.... it's not comming along though...  **sigh**  let it go.

      I so hate driving...  I really don't understand how so many guys find it so appealing, cars and all... I respect it I gues... just as I respect people who enjoy any other nonsense... but cars?!... driving?!...  I am soooo moving to a smaller city... maybe one in which I can move around with a bike, or somewhere with a decent public transportation system.... anything would do... The problem is that I do like going places, meeting people, and in other to do that I have to drive... And as I drive I get frustrated... I start wishing I'd be reading instead, drawing... and in Guadalajara... argh... people drive terribly, maybe I do aswell... but the bunch of us like that... argh!... so much stress... I am not up for stress.  Smaller city?... but big opportunities are in the big ones!!!... right?... sucks... thanks to the internet I guess that can be no longer an issue...  "as long as the place has a way to get wired there's a way to get hired"... Or at least I hope so...   ...  why "in the blink of an eye"... it's a phrase that I got stuck in my head since yesterday... I don't know if it is because there are moments in our life in which we just strive to find meaning in everything... but this movie from yesterday made me think, yet again, about the magic of life, and how tragic it is that some people realize it's magic only after an accident... after a "second chance"... and it's even worse that most people never even realize it's wonders because their life was so lame that there wasn't even a heart attact to survive, nor was there a second chance... why can't we enjoy our first?... after all... time does go by in the blink of an eye... let's make it worth the trouble.

      I just finished putting together all the emails I sent to my list of friends while I was abroad... I really did write a lot!!!...  It's here:   urlLink  vidaenwiu.blogspot.com   It did put me in a weird mood... to remember all those things... anyway, it's in spanish... now as a blog, for me to browse, and for anyone else to read...  By the way, I feel like I could tell that story in a much richer way... if some friends still have copies of some cool emails they ever sent, or emails I sent to them... please, send them over here!!... I will try and make a good story out of all this...

      I just read the last entry to my blog... well, not the "testing 1,2,3..." the one about my life... so much has happened since then... but I guess that one entry was like foretelling my current status...  Now I find my self as a free agent, starting up 3 different projects of mine, and working on projects with another two companies... sounds like a lot of work, but somehow I al terribly relaxed... thrilled... a good mix of everything... As for now I really don't know where my life is taking me, where will I end up... but It feels oddly ok... maybe this is what the taoists mean when they say "go with the flow"...   At this point in my life I realize that, most likelly, I will not be able to pursue all the interest that I have... at least not to the point of excellence in all of them... which is fine... I rather have a bunch of unfinished things in my life, than a life that wasn't worth living, even for one thing... so many people seem to "live" in such a way that seems like a waste to me... my way, I am sure, seems like a waste to many others aswell... but I rest assured that, everynight, when I go to bed, I have a ton of things in my head, ideas, projects and dreams... things that keep me going... things to pursue...  ... and then, sometimes, I wonder how is it possible that some people don't live by their dreams?... not even on their free time they are "someone"... are they happy just being "extras" in the game of life?...  We are sooooo conditioned about the way "life should be", about what is expected of us... sometimes it pisses me off... the one good thing is that I manage to keep in mind that, the world as we know it, is at it is, because of all the people that, in their time, didn't settle for what the world just expected of them.  Anyway... hopefully this blog will come to life again... it deserves it... and I will try to write in english mostly, for some friends of mine that live in places such as hong kong, england and mongolia... he he he... but then again, this is really just a mirror of my self... and there will be those times in which the best way to settle my thoughts will be in spanish...

      Interesting day... productive again, despite the headache... alfanime is taking more and more shape. And the ending was good, I went to this place with Mirta, Leo, Ireri, Blanco and Victor... anyway... nothing really great happend... just a nice time... but there was a phrase that struck me as rather hard if I may say...  Now... I remember some months ago when I wrote something about love... and about how the act of loving is one of those few things that do not get easier with experience, and how actually it gets harder everytime... how the only one true time in which you can love fully is the 1st time, because you are so blinded by love, and so unaware of it's painful side that you give it all without thinking twice...  Then, the "other" times you are actually "trained" to cover up, to take it easy, to keep some defenses up and all that crap...   I did say that stuff once... and I know it really expresses the way I used to feel then, about a very hipocritical and dissapointed version of what love was... even now I know that nothing will ever be as the 1st love in which there was no fear, there was no one to compare her kisses with,  and every experience was new and unique... yet I trully feel like you can fall again, completelly for someone... let all your defenses down and just go for it... I really do...   Or at least I cling to that hope...   Anyway... the one phrase that moved me was said by Leo, she said "the only true love is the 1st one... all the other ones are to try and forget about the 1st"... argh... that is a huge thought... and quite sad if you ask me...   Then a girl was singing close by the song that goes "come te va mi bien?... como te va?.... sha la la... porque a mi puerta el amor nunca volvio"... argh!!!... so sad!!!!... and that can happen... a lot of times people end up marrying someone just ought of fear to loneliness... not because they are really in love, but because it's "better than nothing"... and eventhough that can be a nice "friendly" love... there is no passion, and there is no "giving" of the heart as there was that 1st time that someone made you feel like all those love songs did have a meaning and that they were not that cheese after all...  I do know I feel ok being single right now... I do not want to deal with all the things that you deal when having a girlfriend... and it's rather fun to have several girls who are your friends, and you hang out with them in a cool way...  I hate having to check on a girl every day, of feeling like if I am to do something it has to be with her, or kind of ask for permission and all... etc... I love the "freedom" that I feel at the moment... now there is the "physical" side of it... and I do feel the "urge" for a girl sometimes... but the cool part is that you learn to tame that too... he he he...   But I know that I am living my "ego-ist" moment... my time to be selfinsh and indulge my self in the stuff that I want to do... but I know aswell that, eventually, I want to find a special someone to share... someone to live and grow old with... I really really don't have to get married... just a partner... someone to walk with the path of life... .... ... and I do hope I find that special someone... and that it's not just a nice idea that I am clinging to...  ...  hmmmm... I had something else to write... but I better go... besides, I kind of forgot about it.... anyway, tomorrow is a long day...   cheers...

      Hmmm... I was tempted to say "kicked off"... just like an internal joke... but I didn't think it was quite funny... so... he he he... argh... why did I write this line?... ... there you go... I'm still making nonsense yet my fingers won't stop typing...   there...  By the way, I just saw an episode of the british version of coupling... it's so much better than the american one!, and so much funnier... besides, it's always cool to listen to the guys say words like "bloke" or "shag"... he he he... good change of pace...  It's almost like the british series have a smaller budget, yet they have such a better taste that they manage to just kill their american counter parts... hmmm... that could be a harsh comment actually, I need to watch more of those to be able to say I trully believe and support that.  So... the title of this entry goes to tell about what happened last night, which was quite amusing... now, it's not like we were "kicked out"... but we were "politelly invited to keep it down because other customers were complaining"... it such a nice way that we felt tremendously compelled to ask for the bill and leave to a nicer place, where people wouldn't be so displeased with our permormance of happiness and silliness...   We were in this coffee house, I don't really remember it's name, but I thought it was quite cool because the tables were covered with huge paper and they had crayons, so you could doodle and draw as you chatted...  ooooor make as mess as we did. Anyway... one of the things that was funny was that I went over there while waiting for Victor to call me, since I was going to pick him up, and I ended up hanging out with Victor's friends for quite a while... I have done that a lot recently, and I feel they are actually becoming my friends aswell, yet it was a little odd to see my self surrounded by them, while victor was not on the scene... I guess it would be kind of like victor hanging out with memo and allan... or enrique and hector... it could totally happen, yet at 1st the idea feels bizarre.  So there we were having some good laughs, fun... drawing, singing a little, all that... regine decided that it would be fun to throw a glass of wine over me, so she did, and we all had a good laugh because of it... we were having a rather decent time, and I swear we weren't being annoying... yet someone from the shop decided to complain about our behavior... and the complaint was stated in such a way that we decided to go and leave those sour bastards behind with their bitterness... ha!...  No really... the thing is that... why?...  We were not being annorying, we were not drunk... I think that someone could only be bothered because of our laughs... and that is almost sad... why would anyone in their healty minds be bitter like that?... maybe a couple wanted to have a quiet romantic moment... maybe some guys were doing some serious business... but... why would you want to have a serious business, or a romantic moment, in a small fun coffee shop that allows you to doodle on the table!!!!... it's not like we were "breaking" the atmosphere... The place is there inviting you to have fun...  It made me think of a song that Abby used to like... "let them wonder that you've got, let them wish that they were not, in the outside looking bored"... despite the fact that the whole song really deals with something else, it applies well in here... So sad that we are getting to live in a society where even a laugh will be banned from public places, because those places are not to have fun... huh?...   so... back to work...  **cheers then...  ps. I'm thinking to doing my own template and changing the design of this thing... just to make it look a little better... maybe I will soon... maybe not... he he he.

      Well... last night something weird happened... and I feel like letting it out in this blog thing... I could be just freaking out, I really could... actually I think that what happened was a mixture of coincidences that somehow messed up my night and all the dreams that were meant to happen on my sleep found a way to leak out to reality...  My days have been very messed up in terms of schedule... and I am becoming more and more of a night person,  I go to bed after 3am or things like that... and yesterday I wanted to go early since my plan was to wake up early today... so I went to bed and as expected, I just couldn't fall asleep...  so... what to do?... well... to read of course!!!... and I got Lovecraft's book, and so, started reading it... I read one story... and then another one... and then started reading "the call of cthulhu"...   Good stuff... again It wasn't fear... but they were dark atmospheres... filles with screams, yells and despair... again I wasn't frightened as to throw the book away... but you could say that I was impressed by what was depicted on my mind...  the stuff that was talked about... the rites... the fire... everything...   Anyway... at some point I decided it was enough, and tried to get some sleep again... then is when the fun part started...   I don't really think I was able to sleep at all at night...  I kept thinking of all those things I saw while reading, and to be honest I was a little freaked out... at some point I even felt that someone was sitting in a chair by my bed, and I am not joking... I felt some prescence... and it was all messed up with a weird ambient... like I was half asleep and half awake... honest, I could have been sleeping, and just dreaming of me being awake in a messed up version of my room...  But somehow I got to feel like I was in one of those stories of old... of cthulhu and the ancients...  this story that I was reading before I went to bed talked about dreams, and how in one week of a year a bunch of people had weird dreams... actually just like the one I had... in my "state of mind" I even got to hear stuff... or feel some mumbling in the air...  like a prayer was being said somewhere far away.... or somewhere very deep in my mind...  All night was like that...   It's not the 1st time something like this happens to me... actually it's very easy that I dream with whatever thing I was doing for a long period of time... magic, a video game... or in this case a book...   The interesting part was that the scene of my "dream" was my very room... and the ambient was just like the nightmares that were described in the book... I could almost feel like one of the characters that were interviewed by this doctor from the story...  weird... should I stop reading that book at night?...  ...   on the other hand... the day has been rather nice... the only thing that sucks is this kind of headache that has been with me all day...  but I have spent most of the day with hector, since it's his bday, and it's been fun... we both are going through a rather similar stage in our lives... and he's fun to talk to about it, because he actually undestands...   so... FELIZ CUMPLEAÑOS COMPAÑERO!!!!...  I am on the messenger with daniel... and I just figured out that I kind of feel like the guy from ende's tale "the prison of liberty"... he basically has so many choices and doors open, that does nothing because he is afraid of crossing the wrong door... his liberty and the amount of choices in front of him are his own jail... he becomes numb, and does nothing because of fear... argh... I just hope I don't end up like that though...  ... what I am to do?... where will I end up?...   ... canada?... maybe... masters?... nah... not sure yet...  ... honest... if I could just draw and color, and write for a living... wow... that would rock I think...  so... "ta ta"... cheers my friends...   by the way.... cheers I thing is something that I got from stuart and martin... he he he... my british friends... and it's just a word that I really really like... so... "cheers!"

      Luveh Kerapf was one of the ways in with H. P. Lovecraft used to sign his letters, that and another couple of odd names... which is funny... "Luveh Kerapf" actually sounds like "lovecraft"... based on that I started fooling around with names of people that I know, and I came up with quite a few that did sound interesing.  Ctorl Uhis  Lexmorh Hen-o Dhan Ihel Tors Serg Vilah Rhal Jhez Zijel Zhahan Chers Hern Jike Bahal Des Guill Hermo Alkntarah Grab Ihel M Fortny Alanvah Haldes Jhul Iothin Ajher-o  Can you tell which person are they based on?...  he he he... man I could go on for hours!!!... it's quite amuzing actually, and a good way to come up with names of fantasy characters for some stories if you ask me.  Anyway... I was reading this book that I bought from "luveh kerapf" and was getting a little annoyed that probably the translation would be must worse than I thought... then again, that's what happens when you buy a cheap book.  The cool thing is that it wasn't that bad I bet, and it could actually be the author's style after all... and after a while, once I got used to the pace, I was so into the story that I really couldn't stop reading... the way the scenes were painted in my mind, the emotions... the fear... wow...   Now I've never read something "scary"... and so far I don't think this book is "scary" like "the ring movie"... but it's a book about fear... about darkness... a book that places you, the reader, in a position where you feel helpless in a world filled with wonders and horrors that are much bigger than the boggey man, that are ought to get you, and that you simply cannot stop them... And that's a cool kind of fear if you ask me!!... But I am only starting the book, so it could change... if at one point I actually throw the book away, or put it in the freezer because I get so freaked out, I shall let you know.   On the other hand I am impressed in how productive this day was... really... latelly I had been like lazy, but today I got a bunch of things done, I even worked out again!!... he he he... I am beggining to like this, I just need to start making money and I'd need no more. I worked rather hard in alfanime's web site and got pretty much all of it done... now... I just thought of something sad... argh... I gave gabo the news about ringo... damn... I feel down now...   Here is the thing, a great friend of yours sells you his car since he is going away... he gives it away at a rather reasonable price, and with a pretty cool way to give partial payments... Gabo was in love with his car, and to be honest to me it was always gabo's car... eventhough it was "ours" my brother and I always referred to it as ringo, and as gabo's... and then, one sad night, almost when we finished paying it, some stupid guy decides to crash at full speed on the back of ringo and mess the car up... No one got hurt, well, the other driver broke some ribs, and that is painfull... yet he will live and he... hmmmm... yes... he deserves the pain for being so careless... but the car?... the car got lost...  It's a happy story that no one was hurt... and I daresay that nothing happened to me because it was ringo, the car was of such a great quality that it took all the hit and distributed in such a way that I wasn't harmed at all...  But ringo?... argh... he died...  now we have no cool car... and I feel terrible with Gabo... and even more frustrated because I was hit by some stupid dude!!!... I mean, if I had been drunk it could at least be my fault... argh...   Damn it... I could rant on... but somehow it feels ok to stop it and give a moment of silence to Ringo... and a public sincere apologize to gabo...  -man... you can hate me... you know we cared for that car... sniff... -   ps...

      All day long I tried to get online, and I just couldn't... I wasn't like I needed to, but msn and those things are the only way that I have to feel "wired" and a part of the world... like to have some conversation with "actual people"... It's a good thing I was able to download the stuff I needed to work today last night, other wise the day would have been wasted, and I would have been pissed.  Still now... yahoo mail has been loading since I started writting this and it doesn't even have the "login :: password" box yet... argh!!... I need to contact my ISP and see what the freak is wrong... I do need to check my email.  Anyway... I finished reading "100 años de soledad"... wow... wow... I don't know why I waited so long to read that book!... I guess it's just that the author and all, it sounded plain boring. I love reading, but I despise all the stuff that they made me read at school... actually most of the times I asked the teachers if I could read my own book instead of what they wanted me to read... the times that they did let me do that they ended up quite surprised, because my books usually were "fatter" than the suggested ones... he he he... and that earned me some weird looks by some class mates... So Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of those authors that they make you read at school... and I guess deep in my mind there was a conection between him, his work, and how boring classes used to be... that's why I waited so long.  (still not able to check my mail... I am actually not on blogger... I am typing on notepad!)...  So this book tells the story of a town, since it's raise to it's decline... and a family that had a lot to do with how things happened over there... the story of Macondo and the Buendia family, and it's very hard to really say what it is about. Lets just say that the book manages to put together about 100 years of events in a very particular way, letting us know about the past, the future and how it all collides in the "present"... it's very common to see little glimpses of "what's going to happen"... then read several chapters later about it and be like "so that's what they were talking about"!... The book talks about dreams, all sort of dreams... about self delusions, figthing for a dream and losing, being in love... about excess, fests and famine... and about being lonelly.   The way the book ended gave me goose bumps... I really didn't know how he was going to end a story that just seemed to go on for ever...   ... and then I was amused by tim burton's book "la tragica muerte del niño ostra"... he he he... funny verses and very cool drawings... I didn't know he started his career as an artist for disney...   (what the heck!!!!!... still not able to check my mail!!)...  One of the character's from Garcia Marquez' book, Aureliano, seemed to have a very cool life to me... he would spend his best hours just reading and reading and reading... he really cared about nothing but that, learning more, deciphering some old books, and travelling all over the world using his eyes as transport and his mind as a ticket... he knew about so many places, while he literally hadn't been out of his house ever... his life was devoted to reading, writing, and learning... that's a good life!!... He really didn't have much other hobbies or anything, nor he cared much about food... so money for him was unimportant...   And this made me think, a little, of a conversation that I had the other day with Pille... he has a dream, sort of... but to his parents he is totally out of his mind... I probably shouldn't talk about his plans here though... but the thing is that they are very very cool, and it's really a way of life that would bring him all the joy that he is looking for... the issue here is that so much is expected of us once we graduate, our families have expectations... they "know better"... so thinking about something a little out of the ordinary is like a suicide... not because you kill your self, but because all of a sudden you place your self in front of a moving train willing to destroy your dreams... and with out dreams you are nothing, probably just a zombie.  Pille was talking about a life that wasn't material at all... in terms of money he needed the bare minimum, stuff like that... and by knowing him I am sure he would make it and be sooo happy... but hey!!... you studied all those years?, in the "best university"?... and will end up like that?!... what about a family?... your kids?... the stuff you want?... bla bla bla...   A lot of the things that are expected of a young man are based on the "outside"... material needs... what if you really don't care about that?... what if you find a way of life that really doesn't have an issue... sure, you may not be able to buy a bunch of things and all... but what if you really don't care about buying a bunch of things?!?!... that could really happen... and while to the eyes of a bunch of people you would be "poor", to your eyes you would be happy, and those other people would be wasting their lives in stuff that doesn't really make them full as a person.  Now... you need balance of course... you want to travel and all that?... well then you better figure out a way to make money... the important thing, I guess, is to realize what is it that YOU want in your life... not what others think you should want... once you figure out your "dreamlife", then you can think of ways to make it happen... and even if that dreamlife is in direct conflict with the "status quo" you have to keep going... and keep thinking that the world is where it is because of all the people that didn't settle on how it was in their time... he he he... I do like that idea, don't I?... now that I think about it maybe I should stop writting about that... this blog thing will become rather boring if I just focus on that idea...

      Ahhhh... so tired... but in a way that feels so good... for the 1st time in months I actually did some work out!!!... He he he... a part of me is motivated because of a wager, a bet that I made with the guys from innox, one in which we all have to lose quite some weight before the 30th of April... pretty much we all have to arrive to our "ideal weight", so I have to lose about 4 or 5 kilos, that or pay an xbox for the office... he he he... now I don't know if they will be able to have an xbox in the new office, but what I am sure of is that the bet is still on, and by that date, some way or another, we will all have an xbox!!!... Then again, the other part of me just wants to feel healthy... to be able to let stress out, sleep better at night and all those nice things about life... I guess I can take away one hour of my day, if it's going to give me better quality on the other 23... besides I can always think as I work out, and I am realizing that thinking is one of my hobbies...   Today I felt bad again, I went to pick my dad up, and on the way back some man did a quick wash to our car in a stop light... one of those that they do with some dry thing that makes it look rather clean afterwards... anyway, he worked so hard, you could see the stress in his muscles, and so quick aswell... he was so happy when my dad said "yes, go for it" since most people didn't want him to touch his car...   Why did I feel bad?... because there I was... looking at him... being so happy because my dad said "go for it" and working so much for quite a few cash... and me?... wondering about my life... trying to come up with ways to make money and still enjoy my time... devote my self to projects that would be fullfilling in a personal and financial way... blah, blah, blah... That guy cannot afford to think of that, he has to clean as much cars as he can to support his family!!... And yet, I complain... that makes me feel like trash... I really don't know what I will end up doing...   In a way I feel that it's not only my right, but my obligation to be happy, to find a good profession, make money but aswell feel good about it... all those things... Like, all that people are unhappy and working shitty jobs... I feel in a way bad for them, but then I feel more responsible since I have the choice, like I do have to pursue my dream... I have the chance, I have to go for it!!! right?... all those people, if they were given the opportunity that I have, I bet they would go for it... now it sucks that life is not fair... but I guess that's why I have to work hard, to make my chance worth it, to use the tools that were, for some reason, given to me.  Oh the other hand I realize that I am a part of about 4 long term projects... good in one way, but I need to find a way to make money real fast... "Fast money" doesn't exist... but I need cash, I need to be able to make a living, and even if those projects will give money in more that a year, I have to find something to support my self during that 1st year... I wonder what Rich Dad would advice?... hmmm... no I know what he sais, he sais "find a job"... but what you do with the money you earn makes a difference between the employee and the business man... during the day your are an employee, but what you do in your "free time" and with the money you make, is what makes the difference... is that it?... should I find a sort of job just to have liquid money for a while?... but then again manage to keep all the projects going?... he he he... craaazy...  Wow my feet are tired!!!... I walked so much today!... with regine (pancho's girl) and diego... I had a good time with those two going downtown Guadalajara... if they had half the good time that I did, I bet the day was worth it for them too... Anyway regine is pancho's girl and she's from germany, that's why going downtown would be appealing for her!... he he he... Now I regret not taking more french, since that's her 2nd language... english is not her best, yet we managed quite well... and even the language issues made the touring more fun!... you can always get good laughs because of that.   ahhhhh ... I am just babbling... and I need to start working on a web page and a logo... paid?... guess what?!... no!!... he he he...   **cheers

      Am I really that wrong?  I am so pissed right now... argh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... Am I really that wrong?!... why do this things happen over and over?!...  I hate it that my brother says "hector wants to go" and asks "hector do you want to go or stay?"... why cannot he make a choice, why does he have to put all the f%&/ing weigth of the responsability on my shoulders?!... And besides, if I do make a choice, he f/()ing thinks I am actually lying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... As if I lie!!!!!... I really wanted to stay at ireri's just watching the TV, at least over there they were watching cool stuff, at home my mom always puts the most hiddeous things on the TV... and then I really wanted to go to the movies with them... but for some magic reason my brother thinks it's a lie or something like that... and he kindly suggest that we go, because "I" (my self) really want to go home....   He claims that he wanted to stay at ireri's... he claims that I am the one who wanted to go and all... why?!?!... because he decided, all of a sudden... that I was lying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.... fuck it....  ARGH!!!!!...  I am rather frustrated... can't you tell?!?!?!?!?!...  On the way home I almost decided to crash into something, or start speeding like crazy... the one thought that kept me from doing it was that I actually had some laughs and all today... which is good... being silly with pancho and his girlfriend regine, who happens to be a pretty nice girl, and me and diego will hang out with her tomorrow just to go around the city... that's cool... only that!!...  Then I come home and there is some issue with my parents about the car... my dad gets weirdly mad.......  This is not healthy... well... writing this is... but not feeling upset like this... man I so wish I could make enough money to move out of my house... my parents, all... they are nice people, but latelly they get on my nerves very easily... it may be my fault... but I do need the space...   breath in... breath out... breath in... breath out...  It was being a rather good day... why?!... why did it end like that?...  Then again... it's not over yet... I could play a cool video-game... broswe online and read about writting and scripts... read "cien a?os de soledad"... or check out carefully this new comic that I bought...  urlLink "the monolith" ... which has a gollem on it, and gollems are cool... and the storytelling is awesome, and the art is just fine... it doesn't "jump" out of the page, but it's really good... Most of the new comics are just very cool art and color, but the story telling just doesn't cut it... this one, the art and all just help tell the story in a better way... which as a whole, I feel, makes a better comic.

      Yesterday was a busy day, being saturday and all I couldn't belp but to be in meetings since 10am till bout 7pm...  It was tiresome to be honest, but it was pretty cool, since both projects are the kind of things that I want to devote my self to. One of them is the comic that we are doing, and it was actually the one that took the better part of my day... but we share about the comic, discuss the ideas, scenes, stuff to happen and all...  it was to me a little frustrating because it was a great way to see that I am really not having all the "quality" time that I want for this project... and I wish I could devote my self almost entirely to it... but I can't, and it pisses me off...  argh!....  On the other hand I was given some weird news aswell, and it was funny... The guys from innox sold a big share to their company to some other software development firm and all, and they are actually moving out from the place that they invested so much in and all that... it must be some great news for them... And I am sure that if they manage everything well they will end up right where they wanted in a much quicker way... At the same time I can't help to remember what happened to a small company in which a friend worked, that was so good that some big guys got interested on it... so much that they even offered them offices and all in "concentro"... and well, something did happen with that small company and it's owners after about two years of the "deal"... The company was gone, and the owners where just employees of this bigger firm...    Argh... I guess the thing does sound familiar because of the "concentro" thing and all that about being "buddies" with a larger firm for a while and all... I so hope everything goes well for this guys... I really really do... Why can't I help to think of that though?...  Juan Carlos (yanx) is very smart, somehow the leader I've always think, I bet he will keep an eye on things... at it's time I shall approach them and talk to him about it maybe... but I am afraid that the only "tricky" party is that since I just got out of innox it may feel like I don't have an objective approach to things...  And anyway, I bet that at least the owners of that other company got paid some good cash for their share, and that's cool too I guess... and my friend never referred to the event as something negative, it was actually the better way for them to reach that status so soon... I guess it all depends in the way you see it... the glass can always be half full if you are carefull enough to find the proper approach.  Moving on... the project from the evening is PRETTY COOL!!!.... it's by deffinition "no business", at it's best it will be a business to support only it's self but not ourselves... but I love it, and if everything goes well it won't take a hell of a lot ouf our times, and at the same time we will do something great!!... it will be like a cultural thing, one space in which poets, writters and artist can be published and seen... and the media will be t-shirts... and I am exited about it!!...   Hmmm... I just read again the title of this thing... I just wanted to write about how much I enjoyed my time walking from "la minerva" to the coffee place "la paloma"... he he he... wow!.. I did rant a lot to get into that... anyway, I just do... I love walking... Walking with no hurry, and long distances, is one of the things I enjoy to do the most!!!... Now, for somepeople it's a huge waste of time, I guess that just like to me driving is a waste of time... When I walk I can think a lot, I can even read, I excersice, and it's a time in which I get the best ideas somehow... I guess oxigen does work for the brain in some amazing way... I remember how I enjoyed walking so much while  was abroad... I get like in a zen state, and even "street - crossing" isn't that bad... I wish I just had the life, or the time, to just be able to move around by walking... he he he... I bet I need to move to a smaller town for that.  ....  I had a good talk with Hector and Enrique last night... we are soo in the same channel... and even situation in more than one way... it's almost funny how so much is said with so few words, or how much we understand each other... I wonder where life will take us... I hope some place happy... ^_^  ....  I just remembered something... late at night I hanged out with victor and his friends in the "glorieta de los ni?os heroes"... I was actually having a great time being silly with them, until I saw that close by was a guy sleeping inside a box... and once we sang something he moved a little... fuck it!... I got so frustrated and sad... and even with my self, I complain a lot about my current status, but dude at least I have a place to sleep... and a computer to write all this... I live in luxury compared to this guy... why?... why is life so fucking unfair?...  argh....   and yes, maybe the guy is just a lazy bum... maybe... but was he given the same chances that we were given?... And there was trully nothing I could do for him, and at the same thing his status, mine, and the whole situation just did put me really down... I hate being "from derecha"... why can't I just don't care?....

      Crimson is very interesting... so far I've only read number one, it's an "old" comic, but I am liking the story telling, and the imagery is quite good too. In terms of storytelling I am not only looking to "what is it about", I am aswell analyzing how is the "what" being told... the way the story flows from panel to panel, the way the writter and the penciler worked together to make things happen... and well... Crimson seems to cut it well. It's a story about vampires... the story that gave the Mexican Studio F the final push they needed to make it into the big leagues... I think the 1st great thing was "battle gods", but with Crimson they just assured their place on the map... and that's what drew me into reading it, that it's a 100% mexican product, yet written in english and having in mind a foreign audience... since this guy knew they were not going to make it in their own country... sad... but true.  So yes... I like it so far... it's a long story, but one of this days I shall finish it...   And yersterday I read "battle god" from Francisco Ruiz Velazco, a mexican product aswell... to be honest, I didn't like it as much... some of the frames were awesome, great... and the colors are good... but them some panels were very poorly drawn... you can see that is was the 1st huge project of this guy... yet you can see aswell how talented he is, and that he can keep a good pace in the panels and has a good sense of story telling... I am almost betting that all the "mistakes" in the drawing were known by him at the time, yet he rather focused on finishing a product, instead of becoming a perfectionist who would never get the job done... and it's good. Francisco Ruiz Velazco is nowadays a very good comic artist, and his series sell great... and has developed an awesome style and quality... it's always great to see the begginings of a comics creator... just like with campbell in the early numbers of gen 13... he really sucked!... he he he...  But even if they sucked, they made them... they worked hard and published.... they were not stopped... Just like silvestry talks about Turner... "not even his lack of talent was going to get in his way"... so... there... he he he.  back to work...

      Madureira's comic, battle chasers... is great... just great... being a "typical" story with the "typical" characters, you are untypically drawn into everything that is going on, the pace of the story is wonderfull, such a master piece of story telling, not to metion the wonderful art, and the great colors of liquid... so... why?!... why madureira?!?!...WHY?!?!?!?!...  he didn't finish the comic... as great as they are, for some reason that I bet he found good enough, he decided to just not finish it... just like that... and we are talking about the comic being stop at a freaking great episode, in which you trully feel like you need the next one right then and there...  but no... it's not finished...   there is no more... and for this, madureira... you suck... as great as you are... man... give an ending to this story please... :'(

      About his thing called "early mid-life crisis"... I was almost sure that it is something that happens in every society in every generation, and that the fact that we are now realizing it it's because it is us who are going through it. So I almost wanted to believe that it didn't have in fact an special anything to it, it was just something normal that every generation of young people has to go through as the face themselves in the real world...   But no!!!!... actually it is quite an issue... and actually it is kind of new. It has been noticed in some countries in development, and very little reasearch has been done about it. Mostly its the fact of young people facing a world that demands way too much of them, the expectations in terms of "productivity" and such are so high towards the young, and so "material" as well, that they kind of crash. They face a world in which productivity is more important than morals, and ethics matter close to nothing as long as the job get's done, and in a mass way. We are talking about forgeting who we are, and about becoming just production machines... and the younger generations see that as a thread not only to themselves, but to what makes us human... so it's a cry for help, a desire to get back to the basics... to arts... so humanity. It could be something close to an industrial revolution, but all the way around...   Living in a society that asks so much of everyone, and that moves so fast, with so much production, technology, tv, and being "numbed" by so many fast things around us... this new revolution would involve something spiritual... a going back to the basics... becoming human after all... trying to rescue the true value of life... things like that...  The interesting, and maybe sad part, is that the teacher of my friend told him that eventhough the essay would be wonderful, and the topic is indeed great, there is so little information on the subject that he would have to pretty much to all the research, and it would take him let's say 5 years to get to an "academically decent" paper... so... he may not do his essay on that topic after all... but he is even more pumped about working on this research because it is so "fresh", and it's something that he wants to go through despite the fact that it won't give him any credit at school... go for it Pancho!.  Now, on a lighter note... I spent the day with regine, and then with Pancho, and I must say I had a pretty cool time with them both. I went over with Regine to Zapopan and the MAZ museum... and wow!!... it was so cool!!!... they have a very interesting exhibit, and one of the "things" that I liked the most was this "red square"... he he he. You enter a big black room, and you see on one of it's wall a bright red square... way too bright, just like that. Then I got very very close to it, say about 5 centimiters, no less... and I was amazed by it!!... I went over to its side to try and see "how was it hanging" and I couldn't see anything... yet I couldn't see where the red light was comming from... (it had to be projected after all!!)... and then all of a sudden magic happened!!!!... And regine "touched" the light, and her arm went right through it!!!... and after careful examination I saw there was another room there!!!!!!... a bright huge red room. A room with its walls painted in red, and very well places red lights... and what I was looking at was just a "window" that let me see some of this other room.... WOW!!!.. now that is freaking cool.  And there where some other pretty cool objetcs around too... some interactive art and all... then we went over to la fragola and had a shake, and one of the nicest conversations I have had in a while... it was very cool, and I got to see that regine is indeed a pretty nice and interesting girl, at least so far she seems pretty cool, and I can see why Pancho ended up dating her. So... after that talk we meet with Pancho, ate some Japanese food, and then went over to the colomos park and walked a little, fed the squirrels, and laid on the grass being silly, resting, and talking a little...  I had a pretty nice day I must day... now it's rather late... and now it's when I have to start working. I have to finish up tonight a catalog for the online anime store we are building... he he he, so it will be a loooong night working with databases!!... yay!!... he he he... but the day was nice, so I won't complain...  **cheers!... peace and love...  ps... I am really not liking the "ultimates" comic book series... although it has its highs, it is mostly "american nationalism" propaganda... I can almost bet it was done after september 11 to make the US people feel all proud about themselves, it even has Bush on it supporting this "superhero" program and all... I like "thor" though... he's cool... and the storytelling is good aswell... the art too... let's say it's a well done comic, but the story or subject matter, the topic or goal of the comic is what I don't like... Maybe I like thor because he expresses some of the things I am feeling as I read the thing... like he's against nationalism, and war, and all that crap...

      There is a topic that I feel I will be discussing often... and it's pretty much something that I already talked about, yet the label gives it a whole new perspective... "early mid-life crisis"... A friend of mine has to do a huge research project on some social issue, just about something that goes on today and that would be applealing to read about... and he being inspired by a bunch of people around him, decided to do a research on the issue of the "early mid life crisis" that youth seems to go through nowadays...  The early mid life crisis is what a bunch of older people get on their 40's or 50's...  then it may not have to happen in the "middle" of someone's life, but it tends to happen around that age, once "kids are grown", or once a person finds his or herself surrounded by routine and pretty much doing the same over and over just "to do it"... with no real sense or goal... kind of with no passion or withour an inner drive do make things happen...  I found a "formal" defitinion of mid-life crisis... it goes life this:   "It is a stage in which men and women begin to evaluate and question their priorities and deal with their dreams and aspirations. While this transition is both somber and serious, some have attempted to inject some levity into the discussion."   So there... that is what happens then... guys start buying sport cars, a motorcycle, women get surgery on their boobs, some people take a dance lesson, start painting, or just start being cooperative in some church or something... to feel like they are doing more of what they are... they are being more than just a worker to society... kind of...  Anyway... what my friend is going to research, is about the fact of so many young guys going through that phase... cases from a guy quitting engineering to become a chef, another dude stops being a computer science guy to become and illustrator (ehem), industrial engineers who want to be musicians or writers... things of the sort... A "come back to the arts"... or a weird thing like that.   The funny part though is that we are not talking about some dream that a guy has, it's a very important inner drive, something that makes them quit their job and start following a dream... and while it's not a desease that happens to everyone, I see people like that more and more often... more guys and girls just tired of the status quo and what society expects of them... and more guys and girls willing to live their dream whatever happens... because now is the time to do it...  A lot of older persons get that same feeling once they see themselves "too old to do something"... once they remember their dreams as something from the past... or some people just give a huge change in their life after a heart attack, or some "near death experience" that makes them value more their life, and give their dreams the priority that they should have....   But quite a bunch of younger people are feeling that way just now, they are not willing to wait till they are too young, nor they are willing to wait till after a near death experience... they just want to go for their dreams and make them happen... they are restless, and they are going to do it...  Now... it may be that we are young now, and we see that... we feel that... but probably the same thing happens with every generation... the same thing happened in our parent's generation, and the same thing will happen to our kids... it's just now that we see it, and empathize with it, because we are at that stage too... that could be true...   but it will certainly be interesting to see how this guy does in his research... and what conclussions does he find... I will comment more on the matter when the time is right... he he he...  ps... is the domain latilde.tk not working properly?...

      I hate social compromises... having to go to places "because I have to"... doing stuff to keep apearances, or so that other people won't get upset... I hate going somewhere just for the sake of not having to come up with a decent excuse later, for all que questions that I'd get because I didn't show up...  I guess I am thinking of all this because I wanted to go tonight to a party, to jorge's party... I didn't know it was his birthday till very late today, and I got out of my meeting till well after 11:00pm... so it was late by then, and to be honest I was quite tired... yet I really felt like going, and I feel bad because I didn't. Not because I feel bad with Jorge per se, but because I actually wanted to be there. And that makes me think of all the times in which I went somewhere just to go... just because I said I would, or because "it if convienent" to go... Of all the times I ended up doing something while, at the same time, I wished I was somewhere else.  Now I've talked about how you actually always end up doing what you want the most... in this case "social apperances" or just not having to give excuses later may be a good reason enough to overcome the desire to do something else. But I am getting to want to stop doing that for good... would that be possible?...  I just want to go to places because I want to... do stuff because I feel like doing stuff. I want people to know that, if I hang out with them, it's because I want to and I think that "using" my time with them is a great thing to do at that particular moment, and as well I want them to know that if I don't go somewhere it's because at the moment, something else seemed better.  It's not that I will stop social commitment... actually if I say "i will go" I will most likely go... people may be expecting me and all. I just want to stop saying "I will" to everything, and just say "yes" to the stuff I really want, and to the others just a "maybe" that hopefully people will come to understand.   I guess it's an "honesty workout"... I know that I will be true to my self, while at the same time my friends and close people will know that I will always be honest with them... and honesty is cool right?... What would you rather want?... me arriving at yout door thinking that spending time with you is the best thing to do?, or me arriving at the door, yet wishing I was at home watching tele, and just being there because I said I would?...  And it's really not a "me" thing... it almost sounds to self centered or egocentric... I mean, is everyone does it I think it would be much better... It sounds funny though, and almost utopic... people will get upset if you don't go to their parties, etc... I think I would feel bad if I invited a bunch of people over to my house, and at the end no one shows up... then again, is everyone is honest, I would have known that they were not going to come at 1st, so I wouldn't be dissapointed... and in an utopic society I wouldn't feel bad with my friends if they say that they don't feel like coming over on a certain day.  I guess it's all a very interesting phenomena... just... why do we always play "the game", and play parts that we don't like?... wear masks that we loathe for real, yet we think they are "addecuate"... Why are we so afraid?... I guess since we are part of "the pack" we feel like we have to do "pack stuff" and be ok with out "pack-mates"... it's like the acceptance of the people around us is so important that we force smiles and wear masks just to keep them around us, to stay inside the social circle. Yet, if every single one of us were honest... wouldn't the sense of belonging in the "pack" would be much better?... much more real?...  I bet at some point someone made a huge mistake and since then society has been messed up... we have so many communication issues, and a lot of them are founded on not being clear, not speaking our minds. If we are honest and clear to our couples, other than letting them guess what we are thinking, our relationship with the loved one will be better... you have to be open and honest about your likes and your dislikes, what are you willing to give up, but which things are just too important for you to sacrifice and all... open and honest relationships are the ones that last... Why cannot be like that to every single person around us?... just open and honest for real... with comments such as "you know whay?, I rather stay at my place tonight" or things like that. Why do we have to compromise our needs and desires just to please others and to feel accepted?...  I know you cannot just do as you please... it's a game of "give and take"... that's how couples work too... you will hardly ever meet a "perfect match", so you have to be willing to sacrifice a little, then win a little extra in something else, and the balance is kept by moving left and right, putting and taking away... not by standing still. But honesty... being sicere isn't that hard... if we would base all of our actions in simple things such as honesty and respect I think we would be much better as a society over all.

      My most recent "reads" on comics have been some issues of "the ultimates" series from marvel, a graphic novel named "magdalena" and the very cool battle chasers... and no, none of this comics are mine... which I know sucks. But still, it's cool that Eve and Jeziel are letting me read their stuff, learn about new story telling styles, as well as graphic styles.  Now, "the ultimates" is kind of classy, yet for some good reason it feels fresh... though I shall not comment on that just yet, I rather finish reading the series... so far I am not terribly thrilled about it, I can say as much. Magdalena on the other hand I liked. I had heard so many "bad things" about his comic, that by the time I read it I was expecting it to suck, and it didn't!!!... It may be because of my low expectations, but I really liked it. The art is good, and the main character "magdalena" is very interesting per se. I enjoy reading stories that have an interesting twist, and it's even better when they have an open critic to the catholic church... I know, I know... it's just that I empathize with a lot of ideas about how church shouldn't be the way it is, or probably shouldn't even exist... yet... there you go... I don't feel like talking about religion that much today.  And then... "battle chasers"... wow... wow... that is my comment: WOW... This guy, Madureira, was able to take the most "cliche" setting, with the most "cliche" stories, and make something great out of it. This is a great example that the same old stories and stituations can still work and be terribly appealing, as long as the story telling is good. He took the RPG genre, the fantasy setting, and pretty much made a comic about some D&D story... and it's freaking great!!!!... And not only is the story good, but the dialogs are pretty cool, and his pencils are superb... I love the way this guy draws... it's HIS style, some of the few names out there that manage to have it's own line and you can tell who drew what just by looking at the style... Madureira set a graphic trend in comics, and his story telling is good... it sucks though that he never finished the series... and I can understand why his fans got very upset with him. It would be close to have gaiman saying "hey, I don't feel like finishing "1602"... or he never giving a proper end to sandman on it's time... I mean, you just don't do that!!!...  Anyway, I have to start doing some research, and today I will actually work on an illustration!!... yay!!...  **cheers.  ps... are my posts getting too long?...

      On monday night I went with hector to the ending of a course he was attending to... it was something like "invite people over" night... and they let us all see a bit of what the deal is with those guys... It's a program called mexworks or something like that, and I think it is very very interesting. In one hand, they are making a huge amount of money for what they do... I was doing some math, and for a course that they gave, that lasts for only 5 days, those guys get in their pockets about 1,200,000.00 pesos... yes, way over one million in five days. That is business...   And eventhough at 1st I thought it would be a scam or something terribly boring/stupid, I think it is indeed interesting... yes it's huge business for them. But yes, as well, they allow you to really learn a lot about your self during those days... it's intense self questioning, self discovering and all... it's all about dealing with your demons and facing them. It seems that this guys have tons of activities and dynamics that make you well aware of all your strenghts and weaknesses, and that you really do walk out of it as a better person... at least more in comunion with your self.  This are things that you could do by yourself of course, but for some reason we never do them... during that event I did one small exercise with a guy that made me learn a lot about my self in just 16 minutes... it is something that I could have done my self of course, but being walked through the process does help. I think it is like joining a gym, once you pay for it, and have a personal trainer by your side making you do push ups, you really do them all and become fit... other wise you always have a good excuse at home to not work out.  After all I think that it is all about knowing the one person that is all the time with you, wich is, of course, you... we hardly ever stop to see who we are, why we are... what drives us, what stops us, and how we can change... and it is very valid to think that we can use a little help on the process... yes some people will make money out of it... but hey, it's all a business really... the good thing is that the money is invested in a decent way.  Would I do it?... I honestly don't know... but I don't deny it... and I can think of a couple of friends that could really be beneficiated from taking it. Which is to say that I would recomend it, eventhough I haven't taken it my self. I guess it's like going to a psichologist... here in mexico people think that if you go to one you are crazy, messed up, or something close to that... but it is one of the healthiest things in the world, and I think it would be wonderful if we all had a personal meeting with a psichologist at least once a month. Those guys have the right questions to make you see things you hide from your self, and allow a lot of self growth. it's not about being crazy, it's just about wanting to be healthier.  That and meditation groups... reiki, yoga... all those work shops that are to help you improve your self and the quality of your life... they can give you so much... yet people tend to see them as folly, or look at them with suspicious eyes... Yes, there are a bunch of guys that just want your money out there, but yes, there is a bunch of groups and people that can trully help you, even if they make a living out of it...   It's as I was talking with Monica the other day... people tend to believe that help should just be free... she works in a clinic that helps people recover from bulimia and anorexy in a very real way, with a good treatment that deals with the problem from the inside... of course they charge, that what they do for a living... but people often are even offended when they realize they have to pay... or they complain about the amount, with out realizing that you are talking about ours of work, during several weeks, through several months... A lot of help is free... yes... but we have to respect the fact that some people make a living of helping others... that is what they enjoy, but they have to make money too!... (and for those who help and charge, you have to be reasonable with the prices please!).   I honestly don't know where this rant is going... I guess I just feel like encouraging people to know themselves better... I want people to take that step and feel ok with approaching some external group and asking for help, that it is ok. You can win so much... and even if you have to pay a price, if you analyze the results and think they are good, go for it... it's your life you are talking about. Whatever improves it is a great investment... Do analyze the group or person, and once you realize their goals are sincere and they are not just out for the money, then trust...   Anyway... that is just what I feel right now... it is ok to ask for help, and to realize that you cannot do it alone... I just don't like all the people who criticize all those who are out there taking advantage of those groups and all...   I still don't know why I wrote all this stuff... but there... it is written... and it shall be published on the blog...  **cheers

      for some odd reason my mozilla decided to stop working... it won't open anymore... and now I am suspecting that someone messed up some of my computer files, or that I could even have some sort of virus... anyway, what sucks is that by loosing my browser it means that I just lost months and months of quality bookmarks!!!!!!... I just can't find the freaking file where the bookmarks are, and that is probably the thing that I hate the most... loosing those bookmarks... argh...  damn... I had so many tabs with so many categories of such a bunch of interesting sites in almost everything that I care about... and now... I shall download another one and what?... just blank... no bookmarks... no record how of I surf the web, and the sites that I need to keep at hand...  argh... I just had to write this...  damn... now to work....

      I just finished up reading the "mitos de Cthulhu" from Lovecraft... it's always great to try a new author, a different style... but it's even better when you realize you like it a lot. Sometimes when you like one or two authors you kind of stick around their work, but it's good to open the door to some new names... you get invited often to places you never imagined existed, or get some old stories told in a way that you didn't think they could be expressed. This happened with Lovecraft in my case, and so it did with Borges and García Marquez, which are some of the "new guys" I am allowing in my bookshelf...   It's so cool to learn about some new culture... or some aspect of your own that you ignored... to see some of the magic that is there and you just don't realize... and books can always do that. It can be a treaty on the mithology of some country, a study of some religion, a bunch of short great tales, or some cool novel... there is always something interesting lingering in between those pages.  Books are so great... they are windows to wonderful lands, magic rugs that let you travel around places that can just exist in your mind... or they are wonderful filters that make the most ordinary thing wonderful, that can make a wonderful story of the act of having a meal... or can make you realize the magic in something as "simple" as a stone... Whether they take you places out of this world, or they bring magic to this same world, books are just great... so great actually, that sometimes you struggle between revisiting an old friend, or going some place new. It happens that sometimes you see a book in the shelf with you know you enjoyed a lot, but at the time, after some years, you can only remember the emotions that it gave you, yet the events that are discussed are rather blurry in your mind... then you have to make the choice of re-reading it or reading something new to experiment new emotions, or revisit emotions in some new circumstances.   When you like a movie, and you want to see it over, it's easier... at most the movie will take about 3 hours... maybe even 9 or 10 if you talk about a trilogy... but a book you know will take you several hours of your week... and so the choice becomes harder... to re-read of read something new... Because we have to invest a lot of time in a book, and time, as we know, is the only one thing that once we use we don't get back... our seconds go by, and they won't come back... so the way we invest them is important... you can always get 10 pesos back, but you will never get back those 10 minutes that you used on the toilet... makes you wonder.  I have re-read some books... tolkien has managed to do that to me, as well as ende... and some books are great because, every time you read them you discover something new... depending on your current status on life, the book has diferent lessons for you to get... Like now, as soon as I get the chance, I want to read momo again... And I know it will have something good to teach me yet again. The funny thing about that book is that, for years, it has gone over more hands that I can remember, and it is the only one book that I have that has done that... and I guess it's because of that it inpires me, and how much driven I feel to "allow" other people to feel those same things... I was going to give the book a nice retirement... it's an old edition and it's starting to wear off, to show the fact that it has been read by probably too many hands... but I just can't seem to let it rest, and there is always someone to lend it to. I wonder of the fate of the book is to one of this days be torn appart and destroyed as it is... In a way it sounds sad... but then again, it sounds great... I guess that if I was a book that's the way I would like to go probably... Just worn out because so many people have read me over the years...   Because a book is not meant to be kept on the shelf... it is meant to be read, over and over, by many minds... books are not nice decorations, they are doors to different places and windows to different parts of your self... they have to keep moving... that is their goal in life... Just like a toy has to be taken out of the box, shown and moved around... a book has to be read over and over... at least I think so...  They say that if you lend a book you have to be willing to let it go for good... books are one of the things people more often tend to never give back for some reason... or they may do after quite some time... I think it's ok... as long as who ever ends up having it is reading it... and passing it on. I think the only one book that I would be sad to lose is that one copy of momo... and mostly because of what it means to me... I can always buy another copy and the content will be the same. It's the essence of this one copy what makes it special... and all the memories that for some odd reason it manages to bring back to me...   It is actually quite odd... but I remember the 1st time I saw it at home when my dad brought it... how odd the cover seemed to me... and how weird it was that the book had the same name that my great dog... (momo was the name of my dog of course)... I remember reading it about 3 or 4 times, and thinking of it as a very cool kids story and then seeing it as a huge critic to modern society... and then just as a reminder of what trully matters in life. I remember a lot of the times in which I let someone borrow it, and the talks we had once they gave it back... I remember thinking that I had lost it for good for a couple of times, once it took over two years for a guy to give it back... but it always came back... It has travelled with me... it was my partner while I was abroad... and it's teachings kind of make me think the way I feel about "work" and the pursue of my dreams... he he he... I sometimes wonder if my dad regrets bringing it home, since it had such an impact on my and my brother, and we are so "out of the system" because of books like Momo...  I think of it now, and think of the girl who is reading it... and the messages she sent because of a cool part she just read... and I think of the next two guys on the line... and I cannot do anything but smile...  It is always a hard answer... because so many books are great... but for some reason, to me, my favorite book is a kids story... Momo keeps reminding me of the eternal struggle agains the gray men, about the magic and wonders of the "normal" world, about how cool tales are, how much you can do by helping others... and how that help is often sometimes just the simple lost art of listening...   **

      There is a subject for an interesting forum... that question, and the one of "you open a door... what do you see?"... they are very interesting conversation openers... by the way, I noticed today how two guys looked at me and my friends in a funny way, because of the things we were discussing... I said something about how interesting it is that people do pay their tacos on the taco stands... that latinamericans have a fame of trying to mess the other one up, but still, in the taco stands everyone pays, eventhough they could just walk out... anyway... the thing is that as we were discussing this, two guys looked at us funny and I am sure they talked about how "weird" we were... or even boring... who cares... it was just interesting to see and feel that for a moment you are surrounded by people who share your ideas, and at least see the world in similar ways, and enjoy discussin it in similar ways... yet you trully are surrounded by strangers who couldn't care less... and that all they care about is fashion, shagging a girl, or going out with the cutest guy... He he he... I know I am going to extremes here... but it kind of felt that way...  Anyway... the question at hand...   Yesterday Yiorch asked Jeziel, Eve and I a question... what is it that you fear the most?... This is something that I had already kind of done with the guys from innox... and it is interesting to see how different prople are driven by different needs and fears in their lives. You often get answers like "fear to leave things unfinished"... "fear to be alone"... "fear to lose control"... "fear to failure"... etc... and they are all very valid answers...  Mine though, was another one... and today I asked the same thing to my brother, and he pretty much answered the same thing that I did... which is funny, because we were talking about the fact that my parents, in an unconscious way, made us be the way we are... kind of "rebel" to the status quo, and huge dreamers... we both talked about how we grew up reading Rampa and the third eye, Ende's great stories, knowing about the world, other cultures and magic, discussing with our dad in very philosophical terms and all... it was so strong that even our cousins made fun of us because we would actually read even if it wasn't homework (ha!), and because when my brother and I discussed we always did it in an intellectual level and using words "to big to our age"...   I know Victor and I are very different... and it's not only our 4 years appart, or the two 1st letters of our names... yet we are closer than I though for a very long time. He is still my younger brother, and it is my duty to bother him, just as he has to be a pain in the arse to me as well... but still... he is becomming more of a friend, and I see more of the similitudes with time...  So... my answer was that I am afraid of not "fullfilling MY goal"... kind of not living my life... not pursuing my dreams... I am afraid of not trascending, not being all that I can be. I am afraid to spend my life fullfilling the expectations of everyone around me but my own... I am afraid to become a zombie, feeding with the smiles and aproval of the others, but never trully driven by my hopes... Afraid of "not making it"... of dreaming too much... of having to leave behind who I trully am to become a "productive man of this world"...   Yet... it is interesting aswell to see that you always actually do what do want to do the most. And this was brought to my attention by Ireri... everybody in the world always does what they trully want to do the most. Say for example, I really want to be with some friends and play video games, but at the same time I have to go to a boring familiar meeting, or a wedding. I know I trully prefer to be with the guys playing a game, yet if I chose to go to the wedding for the sake of social retribution and all that, it is because I actually chose "social acceptance" over being with my friends... Even if at the wedding I regret not being with the guys, I am actually doing what I wanted the most, it was more important to me to keep appearances than to have a good time, and so I did what suited my scale of priorities...  I started questioning this statement of course... but I came to realize that is actually real... the slave won't stand up for his freedom, even though he wants to, because actually his desire of security is must stronger than his desire for freedom... A man won't ask a girl out, even though he is dying to, because his drive to stay in control is bigger than his need to be with her, so he won't jeopardize his control... and that applies to all...  Which means that, if at some point, you "sacrifice your dreams" it's because actually, for you it was trully more important to be ok with your family, or to make more money, or anything... which is fine... and it is actually a good way to see that, somehow, at the end, you really do endup doing what you want the most.  life, life... life...  campae for that!!!!...

      I've noticed that I see quite a lot of spelling errors on my posts... now the problem is that I am almost sure that I had as much errors when I was writting in spanish... I find my self in a conundrum... to keep writting in english, or to go for spanish... A couple of mexicans have told me that me writting in english is "made-in-chista"... he he he... and stuff like that... For now, I will keep it in english only for two reasons... for me to keep practicing the language in a written way, and for other people from other countries to be able to read it... if this blog ever becomes that interesting to anyone else... or at least for my international friends...   lets accept it... english is kind of the international language... thanks to it I can talk to my buddies from india, hong kong, and mongolia for example... so... we shall keep it like this for a little while... and we will see how it goes... what I may do though, is to begin a blog in spanish, and then whenever I feel like letting stuff out in my language I shall do it there... hmmm... maybe that's and interesting choice... maybe not really... he he he...  Anyway, I wanted to write more interesting stuff than that... I do that a lot... ramble on silly stuff...   I have tons of comics to read!!!... yesterday we went to work to Everardo's House, and putting aside the fact that he has more than a 100 toys, all star wars, a huge collection of video games, the coolest drawings, and all that... he has tons and tons of comic books. He let me borrow a couple that they want me to check out, and jeziel lend me a couple more as well... so now I "have to" read a lot of comic!... he he he... it's great to feel that you "have to" do something that you really enjoy for the sake of a project...   What I do have to do aswell, is to ink ink ink... practice so much more... I am not in the league of this guys just yet... I am indeed a KaraoKulta... and this project is ours, mine too... but I need to practice so much more to be able to give this guys the quality that is needed for their artwork... we just have to make this happen... that would be a trabahobbie...  I need to keep on drawing and inking... keeping my self away from color, or at least till I am good at inks... my problem is that I want to learn everything, so sometimes I tend to not excell in anything aswell... I become just "decent" in a bunch of things... but never the best.  It's good, because this has given me a lot of connections, from musicians, to singers, to 3d artist, to programmers, to chefs, to politicians, and anything you can name pretty much... and I can speak their languages and all... which is very cool... but I need an area in which I know I rock...   So... for now... I will stop writting on this, and start practicing more...   **cheers  ps. everardo's son will be named dante.. that is a cooooool name if you ask me... and dante's game... wow... "devil may cry"... wow... he he he... you have to see those gus.  ps2. thanks so much for all those images eve!!!!... man I do have references now!!!.... hours and hours I could spend just browsing through those files... :'( time!!... somebody turn me into a vampire!!!....

      I had quite a day today, one of those in which so many things happened that you could almost swear that they were actually three days instead of one. Early in the morning I managed to wake up, even after staying up till late last night... which actually brings me to last night.  Last night I went over to Memo's bday party, which was rather fun. I had the chance to had good talks with Julio, Alba and Julian, as well to see a bunch of people that I hadn't seen in a while. Most of them are working for IBM now, and they seem a happy bunch. Julian is always nice, and the talks with Julio and Alba were a little "deeper", about life and what we want from it. With Julio I talked about following dreams and moving on, going somewhere, loosing those things that keep us tied down... with Alba I pretty much talked about the same thing, why did I leave Innox and all... she told me she was shocked when she realized that I had done it, but after a while she undestood me quite well... after all she took about 6 months off to think about things before she decided to get a job, and made sure which was the path she wanted to follow...   The talk with Alba was nice enough that I completelly forgot that I was suppósed to pick victor up from chapultepec, so I had to run off the place with Julian to pick him off... man I felt so guilty!!!... poor victor... I couldn't apologize enough...  Anyway, back to this day... I woke up early to go to the weekly karaokulta meeting, arrived over there and meet Everardo's wife Estela... it was odd because Eve wasn't around so I arrived to his place and she was a little forced to open and all, but it was nice to finally meet her, she is a nice girl. A little after Jeziel arrived, and then Eve... we started taking but then something came up with Estela... and surprise!!!... I think Dante is getting into this world a little early!!!... Dante is Eve's son who is about to be born, he was supposed to born in say two weeks, but I guess it was too much time to wait so he decided to show up today... that was something!... Of course the meeting was cancelled, we worked things out, talked with them, bid them luck, and saw them depart to this new adventure in their life... man I was so nervous for them!!!... a baby!!!!...  So it was just Jeziel and me now, we decided to go over to the TEC, do some research at the library about architecture for the comic, and so we worked soem hours on ideas for different places, kinds of buildings of the civilizations and all. At about 3pm a cop came over to kick us out of the library because it was closing time. And so we walked out, went by the car, and then sat in a bench for about 2 and a half hours!!!... we just talked and talked for a long time... and it was pretty cool. Its always very pleasant to have one of those talks.  Of course we talked about a 100 different things, but one of them was religion and human beliefs. One of the things that we were discussing is how most of religions today are based on fear... fear to do something shameful in the eyes of the Lord, fear to go to hell, fear to be punished... they are based on fear and guilt... which sucks. And then I stared developing this idea about the ancient greeks, since I am reading about them and their beliefs. It was very interesting to find a wonderful conection there.  The "craddle" of out western civilization, the foundation of the arts, aesthetics, the sports spirit, mathematics, phisics, philosophy, architecture and all those things come from the ancient greece. Just a tiny little spot on the map was able to bring so many things to this world, that were the basis of what we see today. Even the democracy and those government ideas from ancient greece and rome.  And it's interesting to see that culture flourished so much in a civilization that had "human gods"... a civilization whose deities made mistakes... one in which people did not fear hell or such a damnation, Hades was the Lord of the underworld, but he was no Satan. The did believed in right and wrong, punishment and reward, but their sense was so much different. Their Zeus would flirt around with girls and would love boys, the goddesses wanted love and attention, cupid the god of love would cause man to do crazy things and seem evil at times... but so is love. Their civilization was built around a bunch of gods that did not only represented the best qualities of humans, but the worst as well, which made them even more human...  Could there really be a connection?... how much can we judge or determine from a civilization by the way their gods act and do?... how much can we learn from them and expect from them?. And how much can we grow today in a world were the tools of belief are fear and guilt?. I was just interested to see a hint of connection there. Maybe it's a topic in which I will do more research, and maybe too it will be an interesting idea finder for some story to write in the near future.  Now I am at home, waitig for some visits to come over... reading a kick ass comic that is causing me to not be able to do much else (100 bullets), and waiting to check my email and download a character that I really want to ink, it's sudra... he he he... more on that soon.  So cheers... life is good.

      Today I went to work over by my university, because of the network... it was terribly slow over there too, but I bet it was still better than my house... I am getting to think though, that the problem is with my computer's modem, because right now I am working on the computer downstairs (checking my email and all), and internet is just great... and just a few minutes ago I tried logging in from my computer about 6 times and it just didn't work... damn it...  So anyway, I really enjoyed working at the tec... there is something about the "cite" that I will allways like, and that will be hard to define... and it was nice to be surrounded by people again. I realized today, as I was driving, that I had been locked in my house since monday... not getting out at all!!!!... I wasn't tired of home yet, and to be honest I hadn't stop to think about it... but it was kind of odd...   At the cite I had good talks with them all... but specially it was nice to talk to Martin Merida again... I haven't really talked with him for a while, and it's great to see that he is publishing a lot of his work, and he is excited about a novel that might get published soon!!... that is cool... it's nice to have people like him to talk to, and ask for advice sometime...   At about 3pm we came back to the house, after watching some kick ass video from RUSH... wow... their batterist is so awesome... I couldn't believe it... I really couldn't...   On the way back we stopped by a "tire fixing thing" because we have a tire that always get's kind of flat, and they fixed it... the interesting part was to see that most of the work was done by a little kid that was about half my size... talk about feeling useless!!... this little guy had a great way to use the tools, to use his entire weight and some metal things as a lever, it was amazing to see him work... and so little!!... It made me think of some medieval time, with a blacksmitty and his kid, about a store in which they would "fix" the "horse's shoes" with the big dad doing some stuff, and the kid helping around as much as he could... the good old days of crafts and professions... I know it sounds weird... but I was very amazed by the way they did things...   Now I was shocked when the guys asked me if I wanted to flip the tire.... he meant to put it like the other way around, so that another part gets worn off, but I imagined the way flipping the tire inside out!!!....  I was almost about to say no when Victor, my brother, said "yes" and told me "you are so stupid!"...  he knew what I was thinking... I had the perfect idea on my mind of the guy flipping the tire inside out!!!... ha ha ha... anyway... thank to my brother I didn't look that stupid to the shop owner.  When we arrived home I couldn't help to think of yesterday and something that I did... and how I felt when I did it. I saw this wonderful golf court that is across the street, and thought about the 1st time ever walked on it... which was yesterday.   See... there are just a few golf courts around the city, and the one right in front of my house is one of the nicest... of course we have no subscription to the club, so I had never gone in there, just watched in from the "terraza"... The fun part is that right in front our house there is a little fence that has a way to jump over it and be on the field. I never did it though... it was wrong!!!!....  WHY?!?!.. Why didn't I ever do it?!... I always see people walking in and out of the field by that fence, with the golf sticks and all... they are members most likelly, yet that entrance is more convient to them since their house ir over by here, and not by the actual door...   Yesterday with Hector I jumped the fence for the 1st time, and I couldn't stop feeling guilty, and that some cop would show up from somewhere to kick us out... of course that didn't happen... but why?!... why do I have such a sense of guilt?... of responsibility?... why do I want to always do the right thing?!?!!... I walked by it, was amazed by it's beauty, and had a great time by some lakes that are filled with pretty ducks and gesse... it really was a nice view... all green all year long, well taken care of and all... and it had always been there...  I had lived here for about two years... have had that great place right in front of me... the "entrance" right it front of me... and I had never done it... why?!?!... because it was wrong'!??!?!?... oh man... I am messed up...  Of course when it got dark, and we came back, a bunch of guys, older and younger than us, started getting out of the field by that same fence... guys I know that are neighbors... members?... probably... but so what, once you are it you are not wearing a wrist band or anything... you can do whatever... as long at people are not playing golf is rather safe and fun to walk around by it and all...   why?... why hadn't I ever done it?... what did my parents do to me that I am so afraid of doing something bad?!...  A case for the shrink huh?...  **cheers

      Since I started writting on this thing again, not a day has passed without some new words typed on it... probably most of them are nonsese, but I bet some are decent. Just like this day was, probably not all the minutes were worth it, but a few made the day worth as a whole.  Now it's almost funny... the window to log my self online has been stuck on "verifying user name and password" for several minutes... probably it won't work... yet again. The internet over by my house sucks so much that I actually think I will have to go work at my University tomorrow... just because of the network, and tomorrow I will be doing some heavy internet uploading.  Anyway, as I was saying, the day was good. I actually woke up earlier today (and I am planning to wake up even earlier tomorrow... baby steps), and been working pretty much ever since. For some odd reason I completelly messed up the karaokulta webpage, I don't know what I did with the data base, or something... but it just made things pretty nasty, and I had to work all day long just "fixing things up", so that by about 6pm I was at ground zero again... just like I was early in the morning... well, I worked on some of the art, and now I have learned to recover from that kind of issue... it just sucks though.   The website as it is, I think is technically well done... yet it is not amazing in terms of graphic design... you may not be able to find a flaw, yet it won't stand up against other designs I've managed to get done. It's good enough, looks professional and all... but I hope I'll have time soon to make yet another template with a better impact... this one is kind of "just fine"... and I always try to go for "wow that rocks"... What I want though, is to get it done, to make it work so that people can start browsing it, and so that we can start showing our work and making things happen for us as a company. And for us as a company to, I need to get my ass working on inking and drawing!!!... he he he.  So I had good talks online, in one I was completelly ashamed of my self when I realized that yesterday was memo's bday and I didn't even send him an ecard... and I talked to him online!!!... argh... why am I like this?... the same thing happened with maruccia the other day... why why why?. I keep doing that... I need to get my self an account into one of those online things that let you know about bdays and all... sometimes I even forget my parents... anyway... HAPPY BELATED BDAY MEMO!!... you know I care, and I would swear the day was tomorrow... sniff... he he he.  Yesterday I was brought one form from this course about self discovery and all... usually I would think that is crap... but seing the change in a couple of people that I know, I think it's worth the shot. Mostly because one of them is a grown man that would have never done that in his life, he entered the course forced by his son, but now he is walking lighter and all... you can see the change on the energy the projects. So I will give it a try, the only issue was the money, but someone was kind enough to "sponsor" me the thing, till I could pay them back, with no hurry on the "paying back"... the cool thing is that they said that they were sure I was going to make much more than that, so they were not afraid of letting me use the money for the time being... I don't like it at 1st... I don't like using other people's money... but I feel like it's a good opportunity. I talked to Hector about it today... he came over to the house and spent the evening here... I think it may help me find the real reason of some of my fears, and give me tool to control them...  Yes... I will do that...  On the other hand, 100 bullets rocks... it really really does... read it please...   And I bumped into  urlLink this article about comics ... its interesting.

      You know that religions are pretty much all based on the same thing... there are ideas of deities, most of them are based on love and respect, true and justice... they all preach pretty much the same, yet the names and places change... and indeed, for some odd reason some even preach that all the other ones are wrong...   Anyway, sometimes is odd to find a weird coincidence between religions, like yesterday... I read about a huge flood that placed water upon the surface of all earth, all but the Parnaso, a very high mountain. This flood was caused by Zeus, because humans had become wicked and he was so upset at them that he decided to wipe them out. Then a wooden boat appears on the horizon, which had Deucalion and Pirra on it, Deucalion was Prometeo's son. Since Prometeo knew that the flood was going to happen, he instructed this guy to build a boat and to sail on it with his woman once the flood started...   After a while the water was gone again, this two guys were allowed to live by Zeus because they had a good hearth, and then they helped "reconstruct" humanity, but now based on rocks instead of metals...  Now the similarities aren't much... but the idea of the flood, and the wooden boat built by this good man, is interesting... isn't it?...  so... back to work....

      What am I afraid of?... which invisible chains keep constraining me from being what I truly can be?... what can I be?... truly... what can I be?... I'm tired of feeling like this guy from the "prison of liberty" tale... so many choices, so many doors... too afraid to open one, to cross the door. Too afraid to leave the other choices behind and once and for all set my 100% in one single thing...  Why can't I say no?... why do I get involved in so many things?... and then not do anything great in any of them?... My actions I think have not been driven by hopes, they have been driven by fears... even quitting innox was driven by fear... a fear to get caught up in software development... ha!... but fear after all... which fear made me stay on my major?... who do I want to please?... Why do my parent's fears have such a huge repercussion on my insides... why do they make me be like this?...  I was invited to take part of this course, a course in which pretty much they will take my insides out, make me look at them, probably puke, clean them, and put them back in place. A course of self discovery, of "fear finding" an fighting... I am almost sure that I know what I want to be... I think I have known for quite a while in my life... but my fears keep pushing me away from that dream... and they have harmed the dream so much that now I don't think I will ever be as good as drawing as I wanted... the more I learn about comics, the more I read them, the more I see what it takes, and the more I realize that I've wasted so much of my time learning "the right things" and leaving my true passions locked inside some closet...  When I was a kid those were fun passions... passion that would make me stay coloring and drawing for hours... and a passion that was encouraged even by my parents... but then it was growing up time... "getting serious time"... without realizing it I locked up those passions, and with the time they have become huge monsters ought to get revenge... they want pay back for all this "lost" years. They are still my passions, they are fiery, strong, dinamic... they make things happen... but they are no longer the "warm feelings" making the kid draw in the wall... they are fully grown dreams willing to tear my self appart for not paying attention to them...   According to this course it's all about the fears that our family have, not knowingly, bested upon ourselves as we were growing up... our drives and fears come from the way our parents hope and fear, and theirs from their parents and so on... it's hard to believe... it's hard to accept. But quite possible if you ask me.  Again... what would you do if you were not afraid?... Would I learn something if I take the course?... it's almost presumptuous to say I wouldn't... but I think I know what's the problem with me... will it empower me with the proper tools to face that problem?... to be able to walk despite the fears?  Life... success... making money... fullfilling expectations... my expectations... my parents... my life... their son... my success... their failure?.  How?... focus... why can't I focus?...   Why can't I say no?...   Ha ha ha... it's almost funny... I just read the "joey's charm" entrance... there you go...

      The "going to bed early - wake up early" thing is so not working... what will I have to do to make it happen?... argh... By the way, this mithology book I am reading is quite fun, I like it when the author is not talking about the myths and all, I like it when he just tells the stories... of Hades and Persefone, Demeter, Dyonisious, and all those interesting "gods" from all. What I am liking about greek mithology is that their gods not only represent divine things, and natural phenomena, but that aswell they represent the most human mistakes, they are "human gods", that love, lust, make mistakes, are silly sometimes, get jelous, have envy, have pride... Roman deities on the other hand are were way too practical, they had no personalities, and pretty much no charm... they were just "good for something"... I guess that's why they adopted the greek's gods personalities and pretty much the entire olympo, just changing some of the names. Those gods are more fun to hear about.  On the other hand, 100 bullets is a kick as comic book... a graphic novel, for very mature readers... not a "kids book with drawings"... the art is very good in a very strange way, but the story telling rocks... the writer knows his business, and the artist... wow... he knows how to use his angles and "camera shots" when drawing... you get your self inmerse on the story, period... The premise is: "what would you do if after someone messes up your life, a guy appears with a case and gives it to you... the case has a 100 untraceable bullets, a gun, and all the evidence of how this one person was the cause of your misery... and he insures you that you could walk out clean of the whole thing"... ahhhh!... I have to fight my urge to pick up the comic and keep on reading...  must... work...

      I just saw friends... I hadn't seen friends in a loooong time, and I am sure there is a lot of things to catch up in that series... man, me and TV, we used to be so close... I wonder what happened. So... anyway, Joey, that guy can always at least make me smile, but he is almost a sure laugh, and the pople that know me have heard me laughing... and what is so special about him?!...  I think he is blinded by his vision of life... he thas his "invisible glasses" through which he sees the world in the most unusual way, a very naive way. Joey is very primal, very naive, he is quite silly yet you know he is not stupid at all. He just won't take life for granted, and he kind of always try to keep it simple and see life in a very light way... people like him seem to "float by" life, with no burden on their shoulders. While others, some times me I think, just walk thinking to much, trying to solve so many things, having such high expectations of everything that... honestly, I think this last people don't have such a good time on this life. And what sucks is that I am one of those in a way... I think way too much.  It makes me think of that analogy from Douglas Adams' books... when he says that while some think that dolphins are not as intelligent as humans, because all they do is to play during the day and have fun among themselves, some other think that dolphins are much brigther than humans because of that very same reason... it's almost silly, but it makes a point doesn't it?.  Anyway... back to work...  Errr... now I am thinking about the so called cow theory... and how cows indeed seem happy. Yet I don't think Joey is a cow, he is not settling for a "regular" life, he wants more, he wants to be an actor, to become someone... I guess I am mixing things up here... probably Joey goes by his dreams and by hakuna matata... a philosophy that I have yet to make an integral part of my life.

      I've been reading a little about the blogging world and all... and there is a whole community of people out there sharing their ideas and thoughs, giving feedback to each other, and making a huge deal of all this. I guess that is what the guys from the  urlLink cluetrain manifesto  were talking about, after all the internet is a comunity of real people, return to those old markets in which people used to go just to hear stories about distant places of the world, the adventures of some hero, or look at some exotic animal... a place to be your self, to listen and read real people... and to be listened and read aswell.   So that's why I registered this thing on some blogging sites, and added a way to make comments to my posts... let's see how that works... I am a little nervous about it though... I always enjoyed keeping this as a "private thing" for me and some friends to look at... but I am excited about the idea of being a part of something bigger. Besides it's just an experiment... we will see how it works.  Anyway I just wrote that down to explain the new links and the few changes on the interface... though soon it will change for real... =P  cheers...

      Yesterday I tried to be asleep a little learlier... I think I was able to fall asleep till about 2am... it's an improvement, but yet it's not "decent enough". The problem is that I am a read-a-holic, and I am becomming obsessed about writting on this thing. Why is that the problem?... At night my house is at ease... everything is quiet... I can actually hear my self thinking without any other noises disturbing my mind... Reading at night is just pretty cool from me... I know some pople "read till they fall asleep", and for some that happens around page 2. The problem with me is that I have to force my self to stop reading and try and get some sleep... if the book hooks me up I could just read all night long no problem.  And the same thing happens with work and writting... During the day is a good time to meet up with teams, have creative meetings, discussions, agreements and all... but the best time for me to get things done is during the night. I focus better and the "no distractions" mood makes me get into kind of a "working trance"... It's not like I work all through the night though... But my "better" hours I think are from say 6pm to 4am... which is quite messed up when you think that most people do get out of work at 6pm, and afterwards in when they have a "social life"...   Still I am going to keep trying... we will see how that goes.  On the other hand one of the things that kept me awake last night was reading about Alan Moore... now I am an obsessive reader, and that added to the fact that I love learning things, is a dangerous combo. I love neil gaimans work on comics, and so I read a lot about him, the way he works, how he started, this an that... but when I found out that he was influenced by Alan Moore's work, and that Alan Moore is considered to be the most influencing figure in comic books story telling... then I felt like I needed to learn a lot about this guy too. He changed the medium by doing only the kind of stuff he would be interested in, he challenged the medium more and more, and experimented a lot with story telling... you could say he was the father of DC´s "vertigo" line in a way... comics for mature readers, not because they were "dark" or "depressing", but because they talked about very important moral issues... and again, it wasn't just the stories... the story telling was important too. Anyway, one of the things that I was interested in about him, is that he is not only a great comics book writter, but he is kind of a magician... for real. His is greatly interested in the occult and in magic, and you could find a lot about that fact on google, yet here is one  urlLink little link  in which the topic is discussed by him... there he even talks about influences like Alister Crowley and such.   I like this whole idea of the power of our own mind and how this can affect the world around us...  As well I read an x-men volume that is very "touchy"... it is number 110 of one of the numerous x-men series... but what was interesting was that it didn't have much dialog at all. All the comic is just an "illustrated letter to doctor xavier"... a letter that kitty writes, in her mourn for the dead of Peter (colossus), and my compliments for the artist. By reading it I felt sad, and empathized a lot with this characters... and believe you me, I am no x-men fan, and I didn't even know kitty existed... but I could feel her grief... and that is something.  Hmmmm... I am writting way too much about comics latelly haven't I?...

      Monday was good... one of those days in which you feel like you did a lot. I woke up early in the morning, which is weird for me nowadays, went over to the tec, reseached a lot about financial aid for cultural projects, got a bunch of emailing done, worked on my blog's template, gave security to the alfanime webpage, and I even recorded the voice for a comercial from the Tec of Monterrey... it went by very very fast. I hate the sound of my recorded voice... I really do... but I think that everybody hates the sound of their own voice, since you just ¨listen¨to it in such a diferent way from inside your head... he he he... anyway.  Once I got home, just when I was about to beging doing some animation for a new project, and then probably do some inking, I got a message of Gil reminding me that we had a meeting today... Now, this took me by complete surprise, because I was supposed to hand in the animation that I was about to begin on this very meeting... and if the meeting was actually today, they I'd had nothing done for it!!!...  It kind of sucked because well, I went to the meeting, indeed it was today, and indeed I had to apologize for not having it ready for today... yet I told them that if it hadn't been because of Gil's message, I wouldn't have gone... and not only I wouldn't have asked for forgiveness, but I would have been very pissed off on tuesday since none of them, or course, would be there. So they took it the nice way and it wasn't a big deal... we came up with some ideas and worked on some story boards... that is always fun.  The part of the day that wasn't fun was waking up... since my scheddule has been so messed up latelly, going to bed at 3am and such, I just couldn't fall asleep at a "decent" time last night, and it sucks to be "trying" to get asleep and not being successfull on the matter.  On the other hand I did something interesting today... I looked for some part time Jobs, and some even "full time" but in sales and with flexible hours... I need to get an steady income, and I guess that is the easier way for now... at least until the projects I am involved in start paying of their share. And I am interested in sales, because of dealing with people, networking, and developing more "people skills". It was fun how I avoided all the technical positions... who knows what may happen, but it was kind of fun submitting my curriculum and stuff. It's something that I have never done before.  As well I read a pretty cool interview with Alan Moore, and it's not the one on  urlLink neil gaiman's  latest post... that one is good, but I read a very fun one in which he explains why he was kind of "forced" to become a comic book writter. When he was just 17, he was dealing acid at his school... of course this is something very bad to do for a 17 year old guy, but his school instead of "dealing with the issue, and helping him out" decided to kick him out. Yet the principal wasn't happy with just kicking him out, he aswell called to everyother school and made sure that none would ever take him because he was such a thread. So Alan Moore found him self not able to study anymore... a harsh punishment for a 17 years old kid. The problem was when he wanted to find a job, they would all ask for references from schools, and thus he could only get the kind of jobs that they give to exconvicts... pretty much.   So his education and "professional" life were messed up when he was just 17!!!... when he was a little older, barelly making a living, married, with a kid on the way, and working shitty jobs, he made a choice. He could stay working shitty jobs that he hated for the rest of his life, or he could go for one of his dreams from when he was a kid and that was still alive in him. So... his choice was made... he decided to quit his job before the kid was grown... and then he and his family lived on wellfare for over a year!!!!... During all this time quite a process began in his life as a comic book artist, then as a writter, and things started to work out little by little... until all of a sudden he was working for DC comics and then the rest is history. He just changed the way we see comics today...    urlLink This is the site  where I got that stuff from... for some reason I ranted on about it, but I guess it's better if you read it from the actual source.  Eventhough I could ramble on, and write a bunch of things that I still have on my mind... I am going to try and begin having a "normal" schedule again, so that eventhough I am not forced to keep any hours, I am still sichronized with the rest of the world... it doesn't seem necesary the times I stick around the house alone doing my stuff... but it becomes a requirement when I have to attend early meetings, or when discussing something with a team at 5:00pm means "breaking my productive time"...    On the other hand I am still so impressed by the Big Fish movie that I cannot really think of anything new to say on a deeper sense of the word...  **cheers!  ps. isn't  urlLink this  a pretty cool image from  urlLink Casey Jones ... I just love that toon feeling.

      "So long and thanks for all the fish"... he he he... sorry, I just thought of that quote all of a sudden...  Everytime I say "bye" to someone, one of those "byes" that you just know will last for quite a while, if not forever, I get in a weird mood... It's not the same to say "bye" to some friend that you know you will see again next week... it's always hard for me to say bye to people I care for and that are going away to some other country or something like that...   Despite the fact that your "local" friend may always die, he he he, which means that everytime you say bye could be the last one; the feeling you get when saying "bye" to the ones that are going "far away" is way more extreme and interesting... it's like you see a part of you depart from good... Just as some people claim that if a tree falls in a forest, and nobody listens, the sound didn't exist... In the same way, if we yell in the middle of a mall, and nobody listens, there was no yell... our own existence is reflected to us by the existance of others around us... people to "bounce up" our ideas with, people that react to what we do or not do...    In the movie "Cast Away" you see a guy making friends with a ball!!... good ol' wilson huh?... well, it's just him trying to humanize and object, and this trying to stay human himself.... So, what I am trying to say is that, every time someone goes away from our lives, that one person is taking the part of ourselves that we could see in them...  we lose someone to share with, to learn from, and to laugh with... and everytime it sucks...  Yet its great... life has placed that person in our lives, at least for a little while... and for the while it was worth it...  Like that "train" analogy... you keep on moving with your train through life, sometimes you share your seat with someone else, sometimes they stay for a long time, and then eventually they move one and take their own train... we miss them... but it's cool that they were around at least for that little while.  Argh!... see?... I am rambling way too much... I do get "thinky" when that happens... so yes... yesterday we all said "bye" to Regine, Pancho's girl... and it was hard for me, as it always is... and to be honest I didn't know her as much, I just hanged out with her for about two days, and then the other silly times in which everybody was around too... But it was enough to appreciate her company, and to start caring for her. She is a fun and interesting girl!... And the feeling of saying good bye to someone that you may never see again in your life is very earie...   It was nice that we all had a toast for her in Ireri's house and all... he he he... and we made her try some real tequila... because somehow she claimed that they had "german" tequila... ha!... as if...   I am thinking now of Aldo, my "baritone" mate from choir... and how I felt when I said bye to him... and how great it was to casually see him one day on a book fair... And him I didn't know as much either... but I had shared enough with him, and I just felt like we were compatible in a cool way... like he could be a close friend...  and then meeting him again provoked in us both a very real smile... who knows, maybe that will happen with Regine one day... that would be cool... just like it may happen with Ganaa my friend from Mongolia, and just like it did happen with Stuart, Martin and Chris the day I saw them in my own city...   Life has a way to turn around... you never know who you will meet again... or in what condition... I guess thats one of the reasons why it's always better to stay in good terms with everyone around you...   So, good bye Regine... take care girl... it was nice meeting you!... =)  "enchanteee!"... he he he...  And the world keeps on turning... life is moving... and now I have to get ready to do some work, and rehearse a note that i will record for a radio or video thing... narrating is one of the things I enjoy and I know I could do... maybe I should explore that as a mean to make money... he he he... yay!... one more thing to explore...  Cheers...

      (The original was written last night in my "hand written" blog... he he he... yes!... I can still write with my hand).  An interesting day, you could say that I pretty much got up because of a call by Jeziel about the meeting today. Then once I was going there I was rather worried that I was going to be late, and I was, but still, I was the 1st to arrive... ahhh... mexican punctuality.  Anyway, the meeting was very good, and we touched a lot of topics, much more than the previous week in which we only focused on this one project we are working on... (hmmm... just remembered that I need to write down the minute of the meeting and send it over to everyone... damn... victor is online... tra la ra)  Well yes, the meeting was good, y I feel very pleased with all that we discussed. There was even an interesting argument between Jeziel and Eve about some of the art (those two really need to be more patient with each other). The good thing was to see that the discussion did evolved into something good, and I am sure that eventually we as a team will develop our own vocabulary and terms, that with allow us to communicate in a better way, and avoid problems like that. Another thing that is good is that we are going to be meeting more often... damn... I am way too distracted, I want to talk about the day, which was good, but I can't stop thinking about the movie I just saw... it made be kind of melancholic, and made me think a whole bunch of things..  So yes... after the "kok" meeting I went with Hector and Enrique to hang out with them, and we had decided that we would see a movie because of Hector's bday, and so we saw "Big Fish".  That movie evoked so many things and feelings inside of me... so strong and interesting that I cannot describe them in words. Big Fish is a movie filled with Magic... in a way is a movie about finding magic in the silliest things, in the silliest events in our life, about finding something special in everything around us. Big Fish tells the story of the life of a dreamer, and how his dreams and fantasies get to mix up with reality in such a magical way to the point in which it's hard to tell which is which... the line that defines "reality" gets too blurry.  I don't want to talk about what happens in the movie, how does it end or anything... yet I feel it's fair to say that at a point it was way too much for me. So much magic, and punch, so many hopes, melancholy... I thought about myself, about my dad... my relationship with my dad, my dranparents... life, dreams... so many things. My mind came up with so many images and feelings, and together with the images and feelings that were displayed on the "big screen", I just had a "sentimental overflow" and... well... I had never cried in a movie theatre... I had never shed so much tears in one of those places, I had never been "not able" to contain them... wow... thanks so much Tim Burton... you rock.  Some people did got out of the cinema before the movie was over... i guess it's one of those movies that you "love or hate". Maybe you have to have a certain way to see the world to really enjoy it, who knows... but It did hit me... and it hit me hard.   Has it ever occurred to you that maybe you're not too big? Maybe this place is just too small?   I loved the movie, and the magic in the main character, so well acted by Ewan McGregor... wow again.  After we left the movie theatre we talked about it a little... it was obvious that I coudnl't cointain the tears, and thus we discussed the matter. I wasn't sad at all... I was just way too emotional!... he he he... que loco.  So we walked by the mall... chatted a little and had fun at looking at the "fashion" of the people walking around, and as usually we ended up in "la paloma" having some coffee and a nice chat.   Very good day... I came home very late, say almost 2:00am, and my dad was in the kitchen washing some dishes... I couldn't help to want to stick around with him in the kitchen... I didn't have a conversation with him, or just a "silent one"... I kept thinking about the movie, and about what my dad meant to me and how much I keep forgetting that latelly.  The movie is such a wonderful "quote" book... magic... great filters to see life through...   I've been nothing but myself since the day I was born and if you can't see that it's your problem not mine.   He doesn't do it anymore, but my dad used to tell us many stories to my brother and I... he even invented awesome tales that lasted several nights of storytelling, he invested a lot on kids books, and then he would read some "easy" version of a classic... he would always read making the sound fx and the voices and all... then from that we went to discuss books and all that... eventually the storytelling ended... I guess my brother and I grew up... but the way that marked us for life is pretty cool, and it's latent everyday...  A lot of people mocks me because I get influenced by the movies I see... I always want to be like the main character, and it's because I empathize so much, I see my self as the character, in the situation, and it rocks!... I've wanted to be tarzan and aladdin, saw my self as a warrior, a gladiator, a templar knight or sir lancelot... a singer, a writter, an astronaut, a vampire and even a samurai... and ten thousand more things... And this usually lasts for a couple of days, till the excitement wears of... but you can see me swinging an imaginary sword, talking like a vampire, or just feeling with the power of Hulk inside of me... I do it because I like it, I dream... I get excited...  But with Big Fish it wasn't like that at all... I didn't get out of the movie wantin to be anybody else... I just felt wonderfully being me, and thinking about how great are a lot of things that I have that I've taken for granted latelly. I got out wanting to be the best Hector Padilla I can be... and this feeling is overwhelming, yet veeery cool.  I feel and think so many things... and I wish I could be able to express them through words... but I cant...   gung ho! life...  que loco... I am in a thinking mood... I will stop writting just because I fear that I will start repeating my self way too much... and I think this bunch of lines will be enough to regain this emotion in the future, once I read what I've just written...   cheers...  ps.  She said the biggest fish in the river gets that way, by never being caught.

      I am sitting here, typing, feeling like I can write something... feeling like I want to write something... but it won't come up, my mind is blank and I find nothing really worth writting. And it's frustrating because I feel it's there, an idea waiting to come up, waiting to be written and shared... there is nothing else that I'd rather be doing right now but writting on this thing... still... it won't come out.  And it is impressive to realize how much you can write about "not being able to write"... I am beggining to think that I could fill pages and pages with nonsense about having no ideas or anything interesting to say... but before I do that I will stop, he he he... and wait till that "something" shows up in my mind...  Tra la ra!... O_o

      Five minutes my arse!!.... Today I woke up at 8:30 feeling all "up and lively" to start working on this webpage and get it done for today, I went over to the bathroom, did my thing, etc. Then I came back to my room, so my bed, felt it's warm and said - oh what the heck!... five more minutes - So I decided to close my eyes again for a little while... all of a sudden the phone rang, I picked it up and they were calling me about some invoices and all, all good... I hanged up, decided to talk a look at the clock and then WHAT??!?!?!: 11:30?!?!?!... DAMN!!!... MAN!!!!... I decide to close my eyes for 5 more minutes and this is how you pay me back?!?!?!...  I can almost swear it was a bad joke and those hours never really happened, God probably decided to just "fast forward" my life for a little while and see how I would react... Anyway, the moral: 5 MINUTES MY ARSE!!!...   Discipline people, it's all about that.  So that phone call that woke me up, to which I am grateful for doing so, was from my hosting provider and she gave me some interesting news. Good for them!!!... I wish them luck, and probably I shall comment more on the matter once I am sure it's ok to do so... he he he.   I am so distressed about the lost time, that I don't really feel like writting more for the time being... all I can think of is how time, of all resources, is the only one you can never gain back... once it's gone it's gone for good... and damn I keep wasting it!.  **cheers  ps. It's not like I was completelly lazy, last night I fell asleep at about 1:30 or 2:00am, and yesterday I had woken up at about 7:00am... so I had been going on for quite a while... there, that was my little attempt to make it look a little better... so now, off we go!!... to get some work done!

      So, this movie I was talking about?... guess what?... "The Catholic Community" says in a letter to the owner of the cinema   "We demmand that the proyection of this hiddeous films is removed right away, otherwise the Catholic community will act in a forceful way, so please avoid disastrous consequences ".  urlLink  Here is the link  with the entire note, it's in spanish though.

      Yesterday I saw  urlLink "the last temptation of Christ",  not that new movie from Gibson called "the passion of christ" or something like that. The movie I talk about was made several years ago by Scorsese and was actually banned in Mexico during all this time. I can see why, it is one of those  threats to the church .  I liked the movie, but I don't think I will see it again for a long time. At a point it became almost too  slow and heavy  so to speak. Directors should skip all the parts about Jesus life that we all know and go to the proposal quicker!. Still, the movie was made in 1988 so probably the story wasn't that told. (say only for about 1980 years... its 2004 years now!, big difference!). The point of the movie though, was interesting, the last temptation I think is a surprise to all of us viewers, and there were several dialogues that made my time worth it. Probably the one I liked the most was this one from Jesus:  You think God belongs only to you? He doesn't. God is an immortal spirit who belongs to everybody, to the whole world. You think you're special? God is not an Israelite.   God is not an Israelite... nor is he Christian, or a Muslim, or a Jew. God, if anything, is way above any religion. Religions are creations and inventions of man,  I think that God can only be amuzed by them. And that is, if we give God a "human personality", which we all tend to do because it is so much easier to understand a God that is "kind of like us"... right?. I believe in the higher power, in retribution, in right and wrong, and I can even agree on the label God, as much as I agree with any other label you feel like using (ie.  universal energy,  ultimate cause, etc ). And I believe all those great guys like Jesus existed, and they were that, great guys. People that had a higher level of "synchrony" with reality and that were able to  blend  in a great way. They were able to "force" their reality upon ourselves and if they said that the water was wine, then it was wine for us all... if they said they could walk on water, we all believed them... they had that great power of making people believe, of making things happen.   I will probably get yelled at by all my close christian friends because of all this I am saying, but I trully believe so. And the more I learn about what Jesus came to say, even what actually is on the gospels, the more I think church is a waste of time and a disapointment. That is not what Jesus came to teach, or Mahoma, or Siddharta... they all came to teach about love!!!!... LOVE... and churches, churches teach hatred, pride, they alianate others and deny "salvation" for whatever reason they seem fit. That wasn't the point!. Now, some churches are decent, and some people in them are wonderful trully good fellows, but in general is all about appearances, fear, and most of them do feel they have the right to point their finger at the others.  Actually, if you are being offended by this written here, and are even thinking "poor hector he's strayed from the path"... how can he dare say all that?... Well then, you prove my point... where is tolerance?. I know I am being harsh, but it's just that I can't stop thinking of all those fake church members that I know, of all the violence and hatred because of religion and the lack of understanding of the one true message: love, I can't stop thinking of all those who dare to say you are damned if you don't give your self to this or that profet, this or that Messiah... as if God had a religion... if "He" exists as a person that actually has desires and expectations towars us humans, then believe you me, all he wants is for us to love one another and have a decent time on earth, in peace. That, or he is entirelly amuzed by us... or was, and he is no longer watching.  ...  On other news, I was invited by a friend of mine to the presentation of her 1st novel...  cheers for her !!.  cool quote:  I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing.      Neil Gaiman, Sandman    ps... sorry for the folks who msn'd me yesterday!!...  I left my msn window open last night, I promise I wasn't around.

      100 bullets is the best comic I've read in a looong time, I will even compare it to Sandman!... The subject matter is completelly different, but the sense of dept, the weird continuity between the issues, the way everything connects and the way you have to just keep reading is quite the same.  What I love about Sandman is how fantasy mixes with reality, how everything is so magical... 100 bullets on the other hand talks about a very "crude" reality that we don't see that ofter, were dreams are bought, and the one with the most power is who makes the calls...   what a great comic it is... no wonder why it has won so many awards latelly....  On the other hand I found out that Sergio won an award with his  urlLink overcaffeinated blog !!!... go sergio!... that site is now considered the best latin-american blog around, and that, my friends is quite an honor I bet... I makes me want to finally work on that design that I've wanted for this site for such a long time... he he he.

      Sometimes I wonder a lot about what is real and what's not... last night I had an ongoing dream about me involved in this all too real Jedi world... I know, I've been playin way too much  urlLink KOTOR  again. Anyway, the thing is that the dream was very very real... I know "it didn't happen", but this morning when I woke up, as I was brushing my teeth and all, an idea poped into my head...   When you read  urlLink something from Ramachandran  you realize that the ultimate definition of YOUR reality is on your own mind, to us reality is what our brain perceives... our only connection to the world are our "sensors" that let us perceive it... yet those can "fool" us... Take for example  urlLink this short tale by neil gaiman.   I know it's a piece of fiction, but can we deny the reality of the experience of that one person?.  Then you realize that "our" perception of reality is just a consensus... an average of what most people believe to perceive of a certain event, and this we accept it as real once several others have agreed upon the same perception. Somethings which are a little "odd" we get to deny in groups, if a bunch of people "find a ghost" while walking on a forest they may be able to deny the experience and say it was "collective histeria"... kind of a collective nonsense, they all agree on ignoring a perception believen that it was just induced by folk tales or whatnot. Still the perception was there...  If a group of people is chatting, and one of them sees a "cartoon chimp" dancing in the middle of their group, he may decide to not comment on the event because it is so unlikely to happen... but it his mind the chimp is there!!!... And since our reality is in our minds, the chimp is real for him... just like dragons and elfs can be to several others. So... about my fantasies?... probably I've been to all those places for real, I've meet all those fairy folks, and kissed all those women... in my mind those experiences felt VERY real, so they must have been....   What I have to learn though, is to accept the fact that the "consensual" reailty is another issue, and probably a bunch of people will not believe me when I say I fought a dragon last night... it's just that my fantasies are not in the "common" realm, that place in which most of us wander most of the time, that doesn't mean though they are not real... at least to me. When an experience is strong enough it is real no matter what...   Hmmm... maybe.

      [SATINE] I cant fall in love with anyone. [CHRISTIAN] Cant fall in love? But a life without love, thats terrible! [SATINE] No, being on the street, thats terrible. [CHRISTIAN] No, love is like oxygen. [SATINE] What? [CHRISTIAN] Love is a many-spendoured thing, love lifts us up where we belong, all you need is love! [SATINE] Please, dont start that again. [CHRISTIAN] All you need is love. [SATINE] A girl has got to eat! [CHRISTIAN] All you need is love. [SATINE] Shell end up on the streets! [CHRISTIAN] All you need is love. [SATINE] Love is just a game.  Isn't love a funny thing?... such a messed up feeling... we crave for it, it makes us do the stupidest things, along with the most wonderful works of art... wars have been fought out of love, and great music has been inspired by it... That cupid guy really keeps him self busy, I wonder if he still works alone or has found himself some partners... he sure seems busy, and there are more and more people around every time.  [CHRISTIAN] Love lifts us up where we belong. . . [SATINE] Get down, get down! [CHRISTIAN] . . .Where eagles fly on a mountain high. [SATINE] Love makes us act like we are fools,          Throw our lives away for one happy day. [CHRISTIAN] We could be heroes, just for one day! [SATINE] You, you will be mean. [CHRISTIAN] No, I wont. [SATINE] And I, Ill drink all the time. [CHRISTIAN] We should be lovers. [SATINE] We cant do that. [CHRISTIAN] We should be lovers, and thats a fact. [SATINE] Though nothing will keep us together, [CHRISTIAN] We could steal time, [SATINE and CHRISTIAN] Just for one day.                            We could be heroes, forever and ever,                            We could be heroes forever and ever...  I am just thinking a lot about it since a talk I had with Gil yesterday... how everything changes, how fool you can act sometimes, the silliness of pride, the butterflies in the stomach that you feel sometimes when a girl approaches you... the way "love" feels in a relationship that is long enough to start becoming rutinary, but still how that kind of love can be very sweet sometimes... how it hurts when it ends, and how great it is to realize, after a while, that you can love yet again and go over it one more time...  He was wondering if it was worth it?... falling in love... all the pain...   I think it is... despite the fee of several tears, real love is something worth feeling...  Women...  them... that one word... those eyes, the bodies...   **sigh**  ** cheers for love and girls!  ps... those lyrics were taken from "elephants love meddley"  a very nice duet in moulin rouge.

      Today something weird happen, for the 1st time I was able to read an email that I wrote more than a year ago, and it gave me quite some surprises... This is an email that I sent to a few close people at a moment of huge despair in my life, I remember I was crying when I wrote it... and to be honest I was afraid of opening it... of reading it... I was afraid of bringing that sorrow back... to get upset or whatnot.  It's an email that I wrote when my relationship with Abby ended, and I pretty much wrote it to "let it all out"... it felt good to write it, and it felt good to read the response from those who received it... but I wasn't able to read it my self during all this time. Why today?. Well, I opened it because I wanted to share it with Gil, a friend who is going through something like that... his girl broke up with him, they had been together for over 5 years, and he is devastated... for some reason it felt appropiate to share with him several things, even this one email, and as I opened it to send it to him, I read it... and it was weird...  It was weird because it did bring back those feelings... but it was weird because I did not get upset... probably a little nostalgic... but it just made me think a lot of whan happened then... afterwards, and how I feel about it all today. Everything changes, even feelings... they mutate from sorrow to sweet memories... from pain to smiles once you know "it's all good at the end"... ha!, it's even funny, this blog thing started as a theraphy from that one event in my life!... and it's come to be a "repository"  of thoughts and events from my life... all sorts of silly things... everything does change.  I won't erase that email, it is important to me I guess... but it was interesting to read it again... see how I felt then, and how much I've grown since the moment...  it's one of those things in which you wish you had more words to describe it... but I feel very at ease, with peace... how interesting life is... how much we change... or as they say, how much we get to become who we trully are experience by experience.

      So, I registered this blog to a few bloggin communities and all, they take a while to do some reseach and accept it or whatever, but now I find my self realizing that it won't really work anyway, because now that I am starting to be accepted, I am told that my site, however, will not gain much notice since I am into a "frame redirect" thing, they are not able to track the traffic flow to my site since in the source of  urlLink www.latilde.tk   there are no proper markers, or links or what not, since it is just a redirect to the place in which I keep the files...  argh... I guess I will just have to settle for what I have now, and keep it low till I can afford buying my self my own domain and hosting for this thing... as for now, that would be too pricy, and the objective of this blog is being kept anyway... which is to register my thoughts and rants about quite some things on my life...   And about those things... why do I always say yes?... but do all of a sudden I find my self with no time again doing all sorts of projects?... he he he... now they are all something that I enjoy, there I cannot complain, but they aswell give me no money for the time being, and they are taking away all my time for real. It was fun for a while but now I have to get serious about making money. I am going to Canada on the summer no matter what, and aswell I need to pay quite some cash to someone... hmmm...   To a coulple of my "hobbie" projects I will have to say good bye... I need to balance more my time, and it's ok to have fun in what I am doing, but I need to get my ass out there and work on things that will give me money "now", no more "future investments"... One of the things that I saw when I left innox is that there are hundreds of opportunities out there,  they can all make lots of money, and you can always be a part of them if you are willing to work hard and "free" for a little while.   I will keep two of those around... but I will have to, for the time, stop working on another two, and start earning money... he he he...  it's to funny... why can't I win the lotto or something?.  Tomorrow will be fun, I will work animating something...  that cannot be boring... tuesday?... karaokulta's site has to be done... wed and the rest?... work on a website for a client, hopefully there will be some cash there. And aswell start making calls and "sell my self" to do multimedia and websites...  I need at least to make sure I can afford Canada and to pay this course I am taking by the end of this month. When I come back from Canada karaokulta will probably be giving more work, hopefully, and I will know aswell if I do want to try and live in there, and which way I will go to accomplish it.  ... he he he... I just thought of the "goddess" of coincidence and how Jeziel and I meet today by chance... good small talk, and I greeted Polo too, which was cool. He seems like a nice guy, I hope I get to know him more as a person, and learn a lot from him as a professional... he draws and inks in a very good way, and his colors are pretty decent too.  I meet them over at Pabellon, because I went with my family to see a movie...  "Cold Mountain", with Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger, Donald Sutherland and several others, the movie wasn't that great to be honest, but I could see it as a good book. I will have to find out if it was based on a novel.... yes it was!!!, a novel written by Charles Frazier by the way...   The movie wasn't that good, but because I think they tried telling a lot during those hours, or for some reason the pace didn't seem quite right... the acting was good, the photography too, there was just something missing. But for the way the characters seemed "so real", and because some hints of some very interesting situations and persons are given, you can see that there was a lot more to those characters and the story than what we could see in the movie. And that is the kind of character development and dept you find in a book... for example there was this kind of "agile" albino guy with purple eyes who was freaking interesting... but we really didn't see much of him in the movie.  Now I will go read something... and again try to go to bed early... we will see how that works this week.   **cheers  ps... mario kart for game cube rocks!!!

      Now there is a phrase that I used to hate:  "fake it till you make it" ... it just sounded too, well, too fake... like a lie... Jorge likes it a lot, and it's one of the phrases that I never really liked of him, up until yesterday.... Because yesterday I finally understood what he really means, and I guess that from now on it will be a cool phrase for me.  The thing is that "words are powerful"... and that phrase sounds almost hypocritical, it could be stated in other terms and have a "nicer sound"... but what I realized it means is something like:  LIVE YOUR DREAM.  Once a dream gets accomplished it's no longer a dream, but a reality, on the mean time you have to make it happen!. You have to BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF, you have to act and do as if the dream is going to happen for sure, it's the power of "creative imagination" and all those empowerment tools. If you don't believe you can make it, then you won't.   So that's what Jorge meant all this time with the phrase, it's about acting as if you can, about  "living your lie" , or  "living your dream"  in nicer words, and if you do it for long enough then it most likelly happen, and probably you won't even notice once it's for real, because you were already living as if it was.   That was nice to learn, to finally understand of him. he he he... the thing is that he uses words that I don't like, but I think the ideas may be the same after all...   By the way, this all happened in a workshop that he gave about starting companies in the "Congreso de Administracion" at the TEC, and I was invited to help him out with the workshop and to speak a little... it was funny, I was nervous, yet I think people listened and were actually interested by what I had to say. At the end a couple of guys approached and started asking questions and all to me, he he he... it's nice!. And in the beginning, when I was setting things up, a girl came ask approached me by "usted"... ha ha ha... DAMN!... that made me feel old!... and it's not the 1st time it happens. When you give a workshop, approach a large group, and stuff like that, you are in a  position of power , and I am just not used to it already.  Hopefully I'll go to lots of those to learn more about it and get more "colmillo" on that sort of things.  **cheers then... now to work.  ps. about comics, I read the 1st 5 issues of  urlLink "blood and water" ... it's good!... it's a nice take on vampires, good art, and decent story telling. So far I wouldn't say it's awesome, but I guess it's only because the story is just starting up, you really cannot judge a story by the 1st TPB, if I had done that with 100 bullets for example, I wouldn't have read one of the best things ever done for the medium!.

      It should be more like "Hector in the Middle"... yesterday I was talking to my dad about life and opportunities, things to do, and about how much it pisses me off that people "knows" what is better and tell me what to do with my life and my time. I may have an issue of low tolerance, but I just don't like it. Like yesterday we were on this meeting and I was told "you should get your masters now, later it will be too late and you really need it"... you don't have an idea of how irritated I was because of the coment, so much that I had to put a little extra effort and keep my self quiet... but the conversation I was having on my mind was something like:  other:   you should get your masters now, later it will be too late and you really need it.  hector:   Really?... do I need it?... for what would that be?...  other:   Well... err... to be prepared of course.  hector:   prepared for what?  other:   well, to find a better job!  hector:   ahh!... I see, so you just want to be an employee and make someone else rich?,   like to become a "de-luxe" employee because of your masters?  other:   well... err... that makes it sound like.... you see...  etc... etc... etc...  And that is the thing, I have several friends like Gabo and Daniel that went for their masters, but I know they did it after a while of thinking, and after they did realized that it was something that they wanted for the sake of the knowledge, or the reseach, of being somewhere else and all that... NOT to get a better job, and NOT just to have a masters on their curriculum... actuallly, the answer from one of them in that conversation would have been something like:  hector:   Really?... do I need it?... for what would that be?...  other:   Well you see, this universities have great research facilities,    direct your whole studies towards some topic that you really   feel drawn to. You will have several advisors, tons of    resources to experiemtn, people to work with.    You may end up travelling giving speeches, meeting interesting   people, writting an article for some magazine..    etc, etc, etc.  Now THAT is an interesting aswer... not the one about getting it because "it is neccesary"!!...   Because the more time passes, the more I realize that a masters is not neccesary to work properly and make good money, actually, you could take all that money, invest it in something else, and you'd have more money like that!. It may get you some "better jobs". But if you are willing to work doing projects, advising, and stuff like that, you can make a hell of a lot of money. I have a friend that could drop his job because the couple of courses he's teaching give him enogu cash, and then he would have free time to work on more interesting projects.  It is a matter of balance, and to choose the path you want to, but because you want to, not because society "dictates it"... if it's a Masters let it be because of learning and the research proyects, or a business because of all the benefits of having something of your own, etc. Each side has it's cons and pros... I just don't like it when people condemn the other side just because from their filter it's wrong.  Just like Jorge who thinks studying a masters is the most stupid thing ever... well... IT ISN'T!!... if you love reseaching, meeting interesting people on the field, and things like that, it's the thing to do... and I dislike it as much when he talks how much of a waste of time a masters is. He is talking from his side of the fence, but why are people not able to try and understand the ups of the other side?. It's just like and argument I was having the other day with Jorge, in which  I was stating that is it wise of gaiman to just focus to write, while others publish, instead of founding his own editorial house, yet jorge was looking at is from he business side and stating that gaiman was lazy and would always work for someone else. In a way you could say it's just confortable for neil to just focus on his craft and let others do the publishing, and he is making other people rich with his books... but he makes enough money as it is!, editorials fight to be able to publish his stuff,  and that is something he rather not deals with.  It's like the discussion on who are brigther?... the humans or the doplhins?... he he he... man, there are pros and cond all around!...   Everyone justifies themselves trying to make the other look wrong or stupid, and showing off how great is the side they picked... probably they all are afraid of realizing that they made the wrong choice if they try to understand the pros of the other side.  Anyway the title of this entry is because I feel that way... I feel in the middle of two great worlds, and I need to make a choice... I almost feel I could be impartial, but I do see the charms and cons of both sides of the fence... And I hate trying to make people understand the pros of the other side so that they can see for a little while it is a good path too. Funny thing is that the ones that can see the good on each side, and that are not radical about it, are the ones that took their time, and went for it slowly... not all the "borregos" that jumped from university to the path they were "trained" to go for.  And damn it, I just don't have a side yet... doesn't that suck?.  Ok then... CHEERS!!  ps... yesterday I read about Troy and Helene, about Hector and Aquiles... and it was very cool to read about Hector... he he he...  he was cool! .

      One word that I always find funny is the word " urlLink gullible "...  the dictionary.com sais it is:  adj 1: easily deceived or tricked; "at that early age she had been gullible and in love" [syn: fleeceable, green] 2: easily tricked because of being too trusting; "gullible tourists taken in by the shell game"   It's just a funny word!!... anyway, I found one article that talks about the  urlLink "high levels of gullibility"  of some people over by California.

      I have been sleeping less than 5 hours per day since friday, and it's starting to be evident. Yesterday I was most of the day like a zombie!!... the sad part is that my most productive time was, yet again, late at night!. For some reason my sleepiness fades away, all of a sudden I feel fresh, and with some music as company I can just start working for quite a while.  By the way, it's impressive how the  urlLink march of the sinister ducks  can not only keep you awake, but amuze you for quite a while!!!...  you can download the mp3 from that link, Neil Gaiman got the author's permission to post the link. The author, by the way, is urlLink  Alan Moore. .. yes, that same guy that I keep talking about.  Something that struck me as odd yesterday was to realize, for some odd reason, how there are so many theories from different cultures stating that the world is going to end in 2012... I don't know why, but the idea got stuck in my head and I know it's founded on stuff I've read in lots of places. I will make a formal research on the topic, and probably post an essay here. While I started commenting on it with my brother and my father I stared realizing a couple of things: (a) if indeed the world ends, we don't know in which way it will do so. Some claim that it is just a "change of the world as we know it", a new evolution of mankind... and (b) I don't care... if for some reason someone makes me believe that it's a true fact that on 2012 we are gone, I would keep on doing my thing and enjoying my life. I guess the idea of a certain date on a certain time does not frigthen me, but makes me value more my "living seconds".  When we came home I was planning to start inking right away, but something out of the ordinary happened and we all started talking for a long time in the  terraza ,  my dad, victor, kike and I stared having this teological discussion, about faith vs. reason, the church, the view of sex and all that... and it was a great talk!. Way too intelligent if I may say... I think I was impressed by my dad... he is always a quiet guy, I whish I could talk to him more, or realize more of his ideas... he doesn't only know a whole bunch of facts and theories on all things philosophical, he as well weaves them together and comes up with great arguments on his own.  The talk was good, I almost wish I could post it here... there is so much stuff inside my father, I wish I could see him more as a friend to learn from than a dad... I know... it gets complicated some times.  Anyway... the talk came to and end at some point, and we all started doing our thing...   It feels good to be only sleeping 5 hours a day, I mean, I feel tired... but I feel I am getting more out of my time... getting things done, writting, drawing... being silly.  -- cheers... =o)

      Can you believe that  urlLink THIS  guy and  urlLink THIS  guy are the same?...  Or what about  urlLink THIS  girl and  urlLink THIS  girl?...   This guys from  urlLink extreme make over  take those shows a little too far... they will do anything, and completelly change the appearance of someone...  Although it's a great way to see the advances of medicine, and when you think of all the disfigured people that had some accident, and thanks to all this they can seem "normal" again, you think it's cool... but why?!?!... all this nice regular people... man... changing who they really are... why?... to accept themselves better when they look at a mirror?... to be more "likeable"...  it's not themselves!... argh... it's so weird...   I am surprised... TV... wow... where will it takes us now?.

      Last night I "inked" for about 4 hours in a row, I know it's not a lot of time, and I should get more done daily, still it was funny and scary to feel my hand completelly numb, and see how my fingers would bend in messed up ways when I tried to close my hand... when that started to happen I came to a conclussion:  every hour or so of inkinf, stop and rest your hand...   I don't want to end up being all artritic or something like that!. I still need to work on my pulse, I have this theory that drawing on the computer should just be as easy as drawing on paper (with a  urlLink wacom tablet  of course), you just need to be able to "map" your brain and hand, and coordinate them both... so that you use your hand in a surface, yet your eyes and the result are somewhere else... it is more complicated than it sounds really. What I am going for though, is that I want to have that coordination just like that, so that I can draw with the same precission digitally, that the way I'd do it on paper... we will see how that goes.  On the other hand I catched up with   urlLink memo's blog   and came to think that, it really is a good blog. It may be because I know him, so I am interested to see what goes on in his life... yet I know that I don't read everything from everybody I know... it just doesn't happen. And today I did read for quite a while that blog, even the things that I already knew about were interesting, because knowing the facts you can focus on the thoughts and ideas behind the actions. This makes me think of a conversation I just had with Martha about the "realismo magico", which focuses on making something special and great out of the most common things... exagerating or overemphasizing events, thoughts and ideas... we all live in a magical world, and everyday we go through a sort of epic adventure... we just need to find the right words and pace to tell that story...   One of this days I am going to try it... one of those dullest days in which "nothing really happens" shall be told in a monumental way... it sounds like a good experiment!.   Now back to work...   ** cheers...

      Yo no sé muchas cosas, es verdad Digo tan sólo lo que he visto. Y he visto: que la cuna del hombre la mecen con cuentos... Que los gritos de angustia del hombre los ahogan con cuentos... Que el llanto del hombre lo taponan con cuentos... Que los huesos del hombre los entierran con cuentos... Y que el miedo del hombre ha inventado todos los cuentos. Yo no sé muchas cosas es verdad. Pero me han dormido con todos los cuentos... Y sé todos los cuentos.   León Felipe

      A full "computer free" weekend, friday I was up til late using it but since then, this is the first time I use it... cool!!!... It's refreshing to feel you can somehow get by without the aid of this things. Still, the weekend was mostly fun and no work, so that could be one of the reasons. So much happened!  1st well, the  urlLink karaokulta  meeting that takes place every saturday. Despite the many interruptions that we had on this meeting, we did a lot regarding  urlLink karaokulta  as a company, and we even made some new friends from all the people that went to the UV to ask for help. In that meeting is where Jorge showed us a video from an Spanish design house, and man... it was freaking awesome. As well we were congratulated because of our site by some pro's, and that is always cool!.  urlLink Raul Trevino  is now officially our artistic advisor, and we were work on get some other big names supporting the project. I really don't like the design as much, he he he, but I will keep it like that for at least two months, and then change the template.  After the meeting we went to Everardo's house and meet Dante, his newborn son Dante... wow... I was scared... And that is not the first time it happens. You see, when you see a baby on the TV, or the picture of one, you see one that is several months old... the newborn babies are sooooooo little, they hardly open their eyes, and... man, I get frightened when I see them!. There is so much life and hope in such a little body, that one person will love, will hurt, will do and undo, yet now he cannot even feed himself... I don't even feel suited to carry them, it's so much responsibility!. I rather play with the little kids once they can fall off, and at most they will scratch a lef and cry a little... he he he. Dante will be a strong powerful man, I am sure of that, I could sense it...   There I meet  urlLink Ulises , one more good talent from around here, with whom, if everything works out well, we will be able to develop some project. He had a cool portfolio, and it's great to feel like you are witnessing the beginning of a new "hot shot" in the industry. Just like when I saw Polo's portfolio... wow... there is so much talent around here!. All we need to do is to get working, to start making things happen, because all the resources and tool are around us, for us to take them. I get so excited just talking about all this!  At eve's house we started watching underworld, but I had to go and couldn't see it all... sniff...   Then I meet with Erik at the TEC, and we came over to the house, it was a nice surprise to see Blanco here waiting, and then to see that Tomas, Victor and Pancho came over... needless to say we stayed up all night talking, playing video games, and walking.... yes walking too!. He he he, we jumped over the fence and started walking on the golf court, and it was great fun since there were security patrols going around all the time, so every time we saw the those light turrets from them, we had to run and hide in the shadows!!!... he he he... we laid our bodies on the ground waiting for them to go away, and seeing how the light of a lantern was veeery close to us more than one time. At most we would have been yelled at, and kicked out, not really thrown to jail or anything, still it was fun.  At a point we came out of the field and started walking on the "regular" road... You see, we live in a closed residential area, so the least thing you would expect is to start listening something as if a horse we trotting close by... but then we heard it, and then we saw a big black horse trotting towars us in the open road!!... that road in which pretty much just cars go by!!... I was afraid!, Pancho was afraid too!!... he he he... and we were even more stunned when we saw a second horse joining this one... now that was odd. Good luck the big black horse only wanted to take a shit right in front of us, and then go away... I think he was showing us his respects... ehem...  Anyway, big fun!.   I stayed up talking till about 7am... yes... a full night with no sleep at all!... he he he. And then sunday was pretty much the same, fun, laughs, and video games. Ahhh... how I missed those things!. Probably what I enjoyed the most were the conversations with Pancho, Tomas and Erik, which I had at different times, and in which we were able to share a lot... I just like those talks!!. How I missed them!. I was particularly happy to see the Alpha once more in the house... he he he...   Now to catch up with my emails, work, and keep making things happen...   So after this long and boring entry, I shall keep up working, emailing, and all that!.   ** cheers!!!...  And in case you are wondering more about Alan Moore, how he came to be, and his interest in magic, here is  urlLink yet another link  found in  urlLink neil gaiman's site.  (I really want to get my hands on a copy of Promethea!).

      Yesterday the course was awesome, I really liked the topics that were discussed, and I am being hitten with great realities... still, I am terribly disturbed by the fact that one of my fishes is "acting death"... he doesn't seem to be a great actor because you can tell he's breathing, but yet I am afraid he might, soon enough, get the part right.  I loved in the course the empowerment that they gave me as the primary creator in my life... the way I see and approach reality... everything.... there is so much to say about it... but the sickness of this fish has me worried....  that sucks...  ps. I will be writting more on this thing soon enough... for the time being I will get other things done... like finding out how to save this guy's life!... :-S

                    According to the SelectSmart.com Belief System Selector, my #1 belief match is  Neo-Pagan.    What do you believe?    Visit     SelectSmart.com/RELIGION         Neo Pagan?... I am not even familiar with the concept, and believe you me... I do not practice wicca!!... yet the test was interesting, and probably, in one way or the other, I am aligned to those beliefs with out even knowing.  A friend of mine, Ale, sent me over  urlLink this interestign link , it kind of shows some affinity with religions and beliefs based on a few basic questions... my restults are very interesting!!!... here are some highlights:  Neo-Pagan (100%) Mahayana Buddhism (87%) Taoism (76%) Reform Judaism (62%) Sikhism (41%)  (whatever that is)  Roman Catholic (10%)   (tra la ra)    It is kind of interesting really... the site is full with adds, but don't pay attention to those... just mind your own "spiritual business".

      I do have an issue with concentrating, and yesterday was a good example, I spent a full work day at the TEC and wasn't really able to get done what should have taken about 4 hours. While being distracted I implied in  urlLink sergio's site  that I may have ADD (Attention Defficit Disorder), yet  urlLink Gabo  was kind enough to point out that my real issue was a case of AD&D... now that "&" makes a hell of a lot of difference!. he he he. I joked around a lot with Pau and Hector, well... mostly Pau and I joked alot about Hector... he he he... I don't know how amuzed he was, but it was kind of funny to be honest!!  Anyway, I had a meal with Mike and Hector, good talk about universities, studies, goals, and even women... ate a lot though!, and the rest of the afternoon I had to deal with my AD&D and with the terrible sleepiness that the meal caused on me!.   At 5:30 we departed, Hector gave me a lift to were the course was taking place and then it all began!. I saw a bunch of people that I know there, we all joked a little about what was going to happen, and then, at some point, the music started and it all begun!. We came out of the whole thing till after 1am... it was tiresome at some points, but sooooo interesting!.  This course makes a huge deal out of honesty and commitment, not to them, but to yourself, and part of the deal is to promise (your self) that you won't be talking about anything that goes on in there, anything but your own experience. Which means that I can talk about what I learned and all, yet not about anyone else, or something that was said to me by someone. Once you are there it all makes sense. In only a few hours, and with few dynamics, I was hit hard by a couple of stones about some "patterns" that now I see crearly in my life... I can't wait to see what will happen today!... And just by those few hours I was able to think about 4 guys around me that would benefit tremendously from the course, yet it's only starting... I would be able to say more about it as a whole once it is done.  For now I think that I see clearly that my lack of commitment could be well founded in the fact that it is easier to not go through the whole thing, because that way you are not failing... I am always a great promise, but rarely a truly great achievement... hmmm... I hope we get deeper into those things as the course advances... I feel like I will be able to write a decent paragraph about what it meant to me... (which can be completelly different to what it meant to anyone else).  ** cheers then  ps... exhibit b) my wacom tablet seems to draw smoother lines in a macintosh, the difference was really huge!. Now I will download in my PC the new drivers, and then make my final judgement on the matter. If, indeed, the mac wins, then it becomes a huge objective in the short run!.

      Yesterday I wasted about one hour and a half in front of that hideous tv!!!... man, it can take away so much of your time and you won't even realize it!. It all started with an innocent  friends  episode, which was hilarious, but then there was another good series, and another... and all of a sudden it was very late and my minutes had gone away!!!... I had forgotten that  tv effect  and how addictive it can be. Luckily I was able to pull my self away from it and started working on an illustration with Painter, I didn't do what I wanted, but I ended up with 3 pretty cool drawings... one of them is  urlLink this one  - it's called   urlLink "huh?"  . It was obviosly made rather quickly, but I kind of liked it, and even feel like doing tons of them and starting my new site featuring a daily "digital painting" like that... would that be a good idea?.  Talking about wasting time, I had a talk yesterday with tomas in which I pretty much admitted, saddly, that I wasn't going to be able to do everything I want to do in my life... I mean, talking with tomas wasn't a waste of time, he he he... but we talked about being able to reach a  master  level in some of our interests, and how only one of those can take a life time to achieve. I think it started when tomas mentioned that he liked the way I singed, and he thought I could keep at it... I know I could... but what about the inking?, the drawing?, the writting?... man!... it's so hard.  We talked aswell about becoming vampires, and how interesting that could be. But then I remembered this funny dream I had once day... it was something like this:   I was in a closed room, could have been my house or some other familiar place,  probably having some coffee, sitting in a comfy chair. All of a sudden Sara appeared out of nowhere and gave me a proposal:  she could turn me into a vampire if I wanted it . That is a proposal that you shouldn't think about twice, but I did. At first I was doubtfull about her nature, was she really one of them?. When I asked her to prove it she did, running very fast and fetching something from afar, bringing it to me, only in the blink of an eye; at least she could use "celererity". Then I wanted to know who made her?, how powerful was he/she?, how old?... and all those silly questions that would show me how "cool" her blood was. Needless to say it all became rather dull and at the end she faded away... I was left human... I think that later on, in the dream, I regreted not accepting it, yet at first it was very obvious to me to be concerned about her lineage and all that!!!   It's just funny... I don't know if I would accept such a  gift , because it does seem like a curse a lot of times. You know, I've read so much about vampires, and each author has a very different way to portray them!. I would like to know how they are  for real , and all those little things, before I would accept to go for it.... he he he... which I think automatically denies me the  privilege , since you  "don't look a gift horse in the mouth" ... right?  argh... now to work...  **cheers  ps. today I begin that "course" at 6pm, and it will keep going till sunday taking away the better of my time during this days. I think I will make an oath or something of the sort, regarding privacy and about not "telling" what goes on in there. I don't know how much time I will be having, but I will do my best to portray here, in the best possible way, what is going on with me in there.

      I just can't get "hand quality" on the computer yet, I know it is possible because there are guys like  urlLink Brian Bolland  who can do it, but for some reason my lines are  jumpy  on photoshop... And it is rather frustrating to be honest. I guess I will have to go back to the traditional way of inking, it's just that I was excited about being one of the few "digital inkers" out there...  on the mean time I will get my hands on the proper tools to do it on paper, and still work digitally to master that technique... I am getting so wonder if it has something to do with the OS... I just drew some lines on a Macintosh and they were so much better!. It was with another wacom, so I will try with mine on a mac and see the difference... if there is one, then that would be for me, finally, the argument to end the discussion regarding which is better... he he he... at least for design. (let's not talk about gaming).  Yesterday sucked... my back didn't really let me get a lot of work done... still I was able to advance a good deal, and I learned a lot about inking... hair is a big issue, and there are hundreds of different ways to "render" it... I will need to find my self a good technique.  On the other hand I had a nice conversation with Claudia, a friend with whom I used to talk a lot, and yesterday we had a little of catching up.  I told her about the girl I dated on december, and then I realized something. This blog begun because of a woman, and it prettu much explains my relationship with her (abby),  then it narrates everything dealing my second girlfriend (tanya), but it doesn't mention Sara at all... which is kind of unfair to her, or at least, to that experience in my life. I just happened while I was not writting on this blog, but still... I feel like I should write something about her.  We and sara met a while ago, but at the time she had a boyfriend and I kind of still had one, it was until the end of 2003 that she decided to contact me and invite me out, he he he. We went to "la paloma", and had a pretty good talk, I was amazed in how much things we had in common!!... and on that 1st date we kissed... he he he... it was fun, because at a point she said "when are you going to stop talking and give me a kiss?", and I reacted like the most shy guy ever, of course I didn't kiss her then, and it made the whole experience mucho more amuzing. Anyway, we started dating officially that day. For the 1st time in my life I did something without thinking about it, just because it felt good. (And I think she was doing the same thing).  The relationship only lasted for a little over two weeks,  it wasn't working for several reasons, but the most important one was that we each had to deal we some stuff in ourlives... they were problems between us two, they were just issues in each of us. So we ended it for good, and in a cool way. Nowadays I consider her a good friend, and I think she sees me the same way... he he he... As it started it ended, it was fast, but for the little that it lasted I think we both learned a whole lot of things... because of that I thank her, and because of that I feel it's fair to have written this, on this blog, that has kept good record of all the  women in my life.   He he he... now back to work...  ** cheers  ps. the league of extraordinary gentleman rocks... I love it... it's not because it was intrigue, sex, violence, and drame, it's beacuse it was them all in the right proportions at the proper time, it's shocking and great, the story telling is awesome, and it's the kind of art I love!!... So much better than the movie, read it if you can!.

      Yesterday I walk "walking" as stiff as a dead man, (you all have seen a dead man walking right?), when I sat I would stand up like an old guy, and please, please, do not talk about trying to reach anything below "table" level, that was way out of my possibilities. Even being on the bed hurt, and the pressure I would start feeling while being sitting in front of the computer made me rather unfomfortable... yersterday, yet again, I meesed up my back once more!.  The thing is that Victor and I went to Alex's place to help him move out, we carried a bunch of heavy stuff from a third floor to a truck, then drove it to his next place, and carried it out of the truck to place it inside his new home. The saddest part though is that I really didn't do much of the heavy weight lifting... I lifted heavy stuff, I know, but Victor and Alex managed stuff like the refrigerator or the TV... how useless am I damn it?!?!... he he he he... still, for the little I did, by the time I got home I could barely move, and it kept getting worse.  I am on the computer right now because I just HAVE TO do some emailing, but even now it starts to hurt, the pressure is building up... man I feel like an old guy!. The worst part is when your parents say "I told you so"... still there was a guy, a friend of my mom, who gave me a great tip. The next time a friend of yours move, each of you guys pay 200 pesos, you hire professionals, they move all the stuff, and you may even have money left to buy some beers and celebrate the new place... I had no idea it was so cheap!, but apparently it is, I will sooo do that the next time, I would chip in 200-300 pesos for my friend!!... he he he... so that is the official new thing that is going to happen.  Saturday was cool, it was a great " urlLink karaokulta " day, as they all are... tiresome because we kept discussing matters about the company, hiring, and a buch of ideas of the sort. And we reorganized the story to make the fist 5 pages more appealing, since when you are "new on the field" they start judging your work from those. At night Polo showed me a piece of the "chasing amy" movie, and it was hilarious... it talks about the profession of "being an inker", he he he... and I was laughing out loud!. Sergio Villareal told me about it on friday when I said I was inking, and now I understand why. The exact dialogue of what goes on is this (I got it from urlLink  this site ):                               COLLECTOR                  So you draw this!                                              BANKY                      (signing the comic)                  I ink it and I'm also the colorist.                  The guy next to me draws it.  But we                  both came up with the characters,                                              COLLECTOR                  What's that mean - you `ink it'!                                              BANKY                  Well.  It means that Holden draws the                  pictures in pencil, and then he gives                  it to me to go over in ink                                              COLLECTOR                  So you just trace!                          Banky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues        signing.                                    BANKY                  It's not tracing.  I add depth and                  shading to give the image mere                  definition. Only then does the drawing                  really take shape.                                              COLLECTOR                  You go over what he draws with a pen -                  that's tracing.                                              BANKY                      (hands book back to                       Collector)                  Not really.                      (calling out)                  Next!                          A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.                                    COLLECTOR                  Hey man.  If somebody draws something                  and then you draw the same thing right                  on top of it, not going out-side the                  designated original art what do call                  that!                                              LITTLE KID                      (shrugs)                  I don't know.  Tracing?                                              COLLECTOR                      (to Banky)                  See?                                              BANKY                  It's not tracing.                                              COLLECTOR                  Oh, but it is.                                              BANKY                      (to Little Kid)                  Do you want Lour book signed or what?                                              COLLECTOR                  Hey - don't get all testy with him                  just because you have a problem with                  your station in life.                                              BANKY                  I'm secure with what I do.                                              COLLECTOR                  Then say it - you're a tracer.                                               BANKY                      (grabbing Little Kid's book)                  How should I sign this?                                              LITTLE KID                      (grabs book back)                  I don't want you to sign it, I want                  the guy that draws Bluntman and                  Chronic to sign it.  You're just a                  tracer.                                              COLLECTOR                  Tell him, Little Shaver.                          Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.                                    HOLDEN                      (off comic)                  Who do I sign it to!                          Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He        looks to his left and freaks.        Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table.        The Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS        pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.     Ha ha ha... and that is exactly what happens!!!... anyway, saturday night I went to the teather to see Gospel, where Enrique performs and he designed the choreographies, it was good!... I really liked it, and to be honest, I did not want to go... he he he. But it was his bday... I guess I was expecting something like the gospel presentation at the TEC, and that one was booooring. After that we went to the Castro Street bar... he he he. We decided to go there because the drinks are cheap and the ambient is very good actually. We had a very good talk, but after a while it was evident we were all too tired, so then we all said our good byes and went home.  Allan and memo went home earlier, but not by much, enrique, david, hector and I stayed just a little longer...  And friday!?... good day, TEC day... then at night the  urlLink alfanime  meeting, the presentation of martha's book (again, congratulations martha!!!), and a good time at the Candela with several friends... there good sergio elightened us with his all too real anecdotes!... he he he.  ps. urlLink  The league of extraordinary gentleman rocks !!!... Alan Moore, well, he's the master... and I love Kevin O'Neil's illustrations... those are great toonish characters!!... great graphic novel... and just as a side note: SHANGAI KID II SUCKS!!!... why Jackie Chan?... why?!... I know you can do better!.... and finally I finished playing  urlLink KOTOR ... what a great game... and what a great release is to have finished it, and stop feeling that anxiety that tells me to play everytime I am near the computer... I will wait a while before I get hooked on another game again!... It's just that, when the games are as good as that, I can't stop playing!.

      Yesterday I bought another fish, he's kind of dark brown "copperish"... quite an interesting color to be honest!!... So now we have "Starsky y Hutch", it used to be "belle and sebastian", but now the duo has evolved... he he he.  On the other hand, I had the most messed up night ever in terms of dreams and all!.  I have some sort of allergy that keeps my nose stuffed for the better part of the night, magically it starts "working" at almost dawn, and only then I can only rest and sleep... it's quite bothersome... I wonder if there is some sort of polen in a tree nearby that is only released at night.  Anyway, being half asleep half awake has always been the best way to get all kinds of allucinations, and so it happened. I read 3 volumnes (50 some pages each) of a comic called "rapaces", an european comic which is very good, and it's about vampires!!!... then, when I finished reading them I found my self in need in more reading material, so I kept on reading Crimson, which is another comic about vampires... so I can almost swear the "dreams" were all about me being a vampire and all that stuff... but it wasn't that much fun.  Now on to that site I am developing... it's working out just fine, "forced march", he he he... but it will be done in time I am sure. :- )  HUG FOR YOU ALL!!!...  **cheers

      What a movie... and to think that it's true, hundreds of people live like that every single day, in a constant battle for survival, forgetting about what makes us human and focusing on what keeps us beast... When will that change?...  Why do we hate each other so much?, why is there so much hatred?. The other day someone said in the news that a country like the USA invests in their weapons and army, in just two weeks, enough money to feed the entire world for over a year... and that is with good nutrition. In just two weeks... what for?!?!?!...  It's just that there is so much fear... we cannot trust each other!... Imagine what it woul be like if all of a sudden, one day, the US announces that they have destroyed all of their weapons and "closed" the army and all the military budget is going to be invested in aiding others. WOW!!!... teaching by example?!?!... WOW!!!... but no!, how could they do that?!... they wouldn't be able to "defend" themselves... so much mistrust...   I think we are the only race that is willing to kill just to prove the other wrong... willing to bomb and entire city filled with innocent people just to make a point... what about using all those resources and soldiers to built a better world?!... now that would be something, that would be an army I would love to join.  We just can't see that the energy moves around and flows in the direction that we make it flow, if we have hatred, mistrust, and such, so will others... We have this "if you fuck me I'll fuck you" culture... and even worse, we are more like "just so you don't fuck me I'll fuck you first"... that is BULLSHIT!!... aren't we tired of it all?...  Can't we all see that a hug always returned?... as much as a bullet is?...   Anyway... I could go on and on about this topic... life is very cool... but it would be even better if we all humans realize it for once.  The movie, indeed, was great... awesome editing, great story telling and photography... my greetings to the director and everyone involved... if you get a chance check it out!.  **cheers.

The project is actually challenging, it has to portray beauty, be elegant and simple, but it has a very complex navigation tree... which will be quite fun (and hard). It's for the clinic of a plastic surgeon, apparently one of the best in mexico. cooool!!... As soon as there is something to see I shall post some link.  So now I will have to keep working on that project...  ** CHEERS!!!!  ps. "Yo tengo mis ideas, pero mis creencias me tienen a mi".

For though they may be parted there is Still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be. Yeah There will be an answer, let it be.  And when the night is cloudy, There is still a light that shines on me, Shine on until tomorrow, let it be. I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be, let it be. There will be an answer, let it be.

      Or well... it isn't such a long time to be honest, but since I was used to write more than once a day, it feels like I haven't typed anything into this blog in quite a while. First of all... my fish did die... sniff...   You see, I had two gold fish, one of them was white and the other orange... they were "belle and sebastian"... both of them... so now, they aren't belle and sebastian anymore!...  I never really knew who was who, they both were "belle and sebastian"... he he he... so now I just have one fish... I will get another one, and probably they will be "hansel and gretel" now...  (then we will have bonnie and clyde, and so on and so fort).  Yesterday was the closing of that course I took, WOW... f&/(ing WOW...  Everytime I felt that I couldn't advance anyfurther they managed to dig deeper!!!... they just empower you so much with the whole cool responsability of your life!!... you become the own creator of your reality!!!... you understand a lot of "shit" that has happened but all of a sudden you see it in another way!. Now a lot of the theory I already knew, tons of books talk about the same things. The thing is that I knew it at an intellectual level, but this guys manage to take it down to a viceral level, and emotional level!!!... and then it's when it hits you and your really embrace the ideas...   It's really hard to explain though... I wish I could... but what I can say is that I was able to tell my mom that I loved her for the 1st time in who knows how many years.... and I meant it... and I did it because I wanted it... and like that so many things...   Argh... damn words make no justice to the way I feel, and to how much I think this has helped me...   I just feel very light, in control... serene... clean... happy... I don't think there is anyone who couldn't learn something about themselves in that thing... who couldn't feel empowered by that knowledge...   anyway ... **cheers!!!!...  ps... let it be.

      Today I meet Panfila... wow!!... she is so freaking cool, her line, the way she looks from every angle, how smooth it is in every single sense... just perfect beauty... God I need to get my self one of those... he he he... so welcome panfila!, and congratulations hector on getting such a cool mac!... :-D  I had a meeting with my client today and it was wonderful, I was worrying way too much with out a real reason, or I think his son (the intermediary) was worrying way too much, because everything I showed him he loved!!!... which is great.  On other news it appears that we've been contacted, because of  urlLink karaokulta , to do comic books!!... yay!!... we've been noticed, and people seem to like our work... the problem though is the nature of the business, as soon as I can confirm everything I shall write more about it, and how it will go.  Ahhh... I feel great... just fine... but my body is starting to "not like" me going to bed after 4:00 am in the morning for such a long time, and tomorrow I begin the 2nd phase of this course which will be from 12pm to 12am everyday!!... Let's really hope I can make it through... since it's not only the course I am worried about, but all the work that I have to get done.  Anyway, cheers!!... back to life.  ps. Today it was nice to see in the bank that I was indeed drawn to look at a girl's nice top, and how generous was the filling... he he he... I was just worried that after so many hours of looking and looking online for pictures of naked girls (for the plastic surgeon), I was starting to "not want to" look at them anymore... since after several hours of browsing I was just being a robot about it... he he he... it's amusing how everything, even that, can be turned to boredom and monotony with the proper label (work). Anyway, she looked rather nice, and it was obvious that all the guys in the bank had a hard time at focusing on her face... I wonder how she felt about it though... :-S

      Al final de mi vida quiero verme retirado tranquilamente en un pueblito agusto, tal vez en la playa. Trabajando solo por gusto, ya no por necesidad. Compartiendo esos últimos años con una mujer maravillosa, mi compañera de viaje a lo largo de tantos años, y teniendo una excelente relación con mis hijos.   Voy a ser el abuelo buena onda, siempre les voy a contar cuentos e historias padres a mis nietos, y llevarme muy bien con mis nueras. Quiero entonces seguir siendo buen amigo de mi hermano, y recordar a mis padres como las grandes personas que son, sabiendo que siguen ahí para mí, que los he hecho orgullosos,  y que nunca me quedé con ganas de decirles que los quería o de darles un abrazo.   Con mis amigos seguiré compartiendo grandes charlas de café en las cuales vamos a dejar claro todo lo necesario para salvar al mundo, la verdad de la vida y todo lo que viene después. Muy probablemente contando viejas historias de grandes viajes y grandes logros, de esas historias que todos ya han escuchado varias veces, pero siempre son nuevas cuando se vuelven a contar.   Quiero morir tranquilo y feliz, sin pendientes, lleno de amor y rodeado de él... quedarme dormido derrepente viendo un atardecer, simplemente no despertar y quedarme en ese sueño eterno viviendo una nueva aventura. Al irme, los que se queden, quiero que me despidan con una sonrisa, y me recuerden siempre con esa sensación que deja un buen abrazo y el sonido de mis carcajadas.

      Charlie is a crossed breed, he's something between a boxer and a great dane, used to be a huge dog, terribly strong, and pretty much seemed like scooby... now he's lying in the vet's floor, without the strength to even get up and greet us as victor and I departed.  His heart is not working fine, his body is filled with water in places where there is supposed to be none of it, and his splin is like 4 times the size it's meant to be. He's about 10 years old, in dog years that's a lot... 70 according to some, or 77... (some people say the 1st year is equal to 14 years)  Anyway... it sucks... maybe he will end up dying soon... maybe we will put him to "sleep"... that long last dream... where do dogs go after they die?. I am sure mine was a great one, I never treated him as I should have, never gave him the time... I was always too busy doing something else... and now... man... I feel terrible...   10 years... he's been a part of ourlives for that long, and we never really gave him the love that he deserved... always living in the shadow of Momo's memory, we were all too busy for him, too grown up. Momo was with us as victor and I grew, he was our "play-mate", but charly?... he came along around that age in which dogs aren't that cool anymore, and some other matters become more important. I always wanted to have a good relationship with him, a good time... but damn... I waited... and here I am.  My parents for some odd reason never got to want him inside the house, so he was always a "yard dog"... something that I hate... he loved us, all the time he loved us, and cherished the little attention we managed to give him every now and then. I wonder what kind of life he lived... he was never deprived of "anything" but attention...  I feel terrible... no matter what happens to him, I won't let that happen again to a dog of mine... if I am to have one it's because I am going to walk him, play with him and all...   Let's hope he gets better... or that, at least, he doesn't suffer that much... (man, my heart was broken as I saw how hard it was for him to get up... to walk down the stairs...)...  ** cheers charlie... you've always been a good lad.

      I remember this one time in which I saw a t-shit that said "NO I WILL NOT FIX YOUR COMPUTER"... it was plain black with white letters, and I couldn't stop laughing... you see, people tend to think that since I am a computer science guy I should know how to fix them... right?!?!... Well I don't!!!!!... TECH SUPPORT and all it's nuisances is like a whole new guacamole!!!... I know how to do stuff, like web-sites, server management, to admin a data base, programming, a bunch of "techie" stuff... but I've never been the guy to get the wires out of the PC's and fool around with them...  Still I manage to get a "why did we payed so much in your college?" look from my parents every time their computer gets completelly messed up, and I cannot really do anything to fix it... argh!... screw it.  That just happened by the way... yet again... and I lost 3 precious hours trying to make that hard drive work... of course I couldn't, now I am 3 hours short, and with a terrible "techie"-self-esteem.... oh well...  Life goes on huh?...  cheers...  ps... the preacher rocks... very interesting comic... it's not better than sandman or 100 bullets, but close... the dialogues are complicated sometimes, which turns the comic into a "harder" reading... that is, by no means, a bad thing... but I am used to a comic that flows a little faster. Still great, let's see how it turns.

      I remember  back in the days  when I used to watch those TV shows with the "cool" grown up guys and all, and wondering what it was going to be like once I got that old...  the dating games and all, those flashing guys and girls, they were so cool, I couln't wait to be of that age...  But now... something veeeery weird happened!... you know, I decided to give my mind a little rest, and what can be better to do that than to watch a silly dating show... so I started watching  urlLink Dismissed , which is, believe you me, a very dumb show. Anyway, so I was watching this show, looking and the guys and girls and still thinking of them as if they were those "older cool guys"... but all of a sudden they said how old they were and DAMN!!!... one of the girls was 21, the other 19, and the guy was 20... WHAT?!?!?!...   I MEAN... what?!?!?!?!  Jezz.... damn... wow I felt all of a sudden old and left out, like those "cool guys" were the old ones as I grew up, but all of a sudden they became the younger ones, and I just don't know where I was in the middle...   On the other hand it was fun to see, today, that if you type "mexworks" on google my blog is posted on the first page, the last link... he he he... funny how the webcrawlers work. So how was my 2nd take on mexworks?... it was great... it was f&/%ng great... I came out of the "intro" feeling very emotional, very happy with my life, very at ease... now I came out of the EIP feeling terribly wonderful, powerful, I realized all that I have inside my self, all that I can give, for the 1st time I can actually believe that those around me when they see that I can do a lot... I just never thought I was good enoug, stuff like that... I was like I came out from the intro feeling good about my self, but now I feel great about my self, and with the entire power and responsibility to share my love!!!... he he he... I know it sounds corny.  Ok... enough, back to inking... this week I have to get two pages done!... he he he  cheers... :P

      There is a pretty interesting documented case about this thing called "critical mass"... the theory, pretty much, takes it's basis on the fact that once a certain average of the population is aligned to one idea, then the entire population embraces is... it's related to the "collective subconcious" and all those ideas.  The story is pretty much this one:     The 100th Monkey A story about social change.   By Ken Keyes Jr.  The Japanese monkey, Macaca Fuscata, had been observed in the wild for a period of over 30 years.  In 1952, on the island of Koshima, scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkey liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant.  An 18-month-old female named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers too.  This cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the eyes of the scientists. Between 1952 and 1958 all the young monkeys learned to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable. Only the adults who imitated their children learned this social improvement. Other adults kept eating the dirty sweet potatoes.  Then something startling took place. In the autumn of 1958, a certain number of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes -- the exact number is not known. Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes. Let's further suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.  THEN IT HAPPENED!   By that evening almost everyone in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before eating them. The added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an ideological breakthrough!  But notice: A most surprising thing observed by these scientists was that the habit of washing sweet potatoes then jumped over the sea...Colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop of monkeys at Takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes.  Thus, when a certain critical number achieves an awareness, this new awareness may be communicated from mind to mind.  Although the exact number may vary, this Hundredth Monkey Phenomenon means that when only a limited number of people know of a new way, it may remain the conscious property of these people.  But there is a point at which if only one more person tunes-in to a new awareness, a field is strengthened so that this awareness is picked up by almost everyone!   From the book "The Hundredth Monkey" by Ken Keyes, Jr.  The book is not copyrighted and the material may be reproduced in whole or in part.      There is more about it on urlLink  this site.   Anyway, the story is somewhat interesting, but what is even more appealing is the idea of how we can translate it to our lives...  to humanity... how many of us are actually aligned to violence?, how many of us think war is  honorable ?, that you have to  fight to survive ?... and what would happen then if, for some reason, a good enough percentage of us all start thinking otherwise and aligning our selves to a peace set of mind... one in which in order to have peace no violence is necesary...   When I think about it, I see that most movies, magazines, even comics, talk about violence as "the only way" and how heroic it is to die in battle, and this or that crap.  I wonder when we started losing our sense of what really matters... when we started having mistrust from each other, and when we became such an afraid society...  What if all of a sudden you start trusting in everyone, but for real!... what if we all align to a set of mind in which all the energy that is used on being afraid and protecting ourselves, is all of a sudden invested in supporting others, in trusting, smiling and loving?  I don't think it's that unreal... but for all I care, I am going to be one of those... to stand in the current, and to think about life that way... who knows, maybe little by little others will align themselves, to a point in which we do become a peaceful society... then we would give them monkeys something interesting to talk about us funny humans.

      First of all, it seems that I was so excited about "the movie" that I forgot to mention it's name!!!... so, there you go: the movie is "chasing amy"... great movie... he he he... now go get it. :-)  And talking about guacamole, yesterday something very cool happened to me. Do you recall that I was supposed to give a speech in the TEC's highschool?... well... I don't even know if I had written about it, and how odd it seemed to me... but anyway, that event took place yesterday.   I wrote something as a guide, and the people that put together the event really really liked it... one woman even said:   "Hector, if you say it like that, and the guys get it, I would love it if you become a teacher in our highschool" ... tra la ra!... needless to say I was very, VERY nervous... and the feeling grew a little when the whole thing started and I was invited to "sit in from", it that "table for the big guys", right next to the Principal, between some teachers and all... it was odd aswell to stand up a little and be "clapped" as my name was mentioned... he he he.  Anyway, the big thing happened when a guy read something like a "mini-bio" of mine, invited me up there, and I gave my speech... at first I was nervous, I must admit it... but after a while I saw that the guys were actually paying attention, so I kind of loosened up, and then magic happened. The crowd was interested, they were amused, and they even laughed at my "semi-jokes"... at the end there was an honest applause, and once the event was finished I was greeted not only by the teachers and staff, but by a few courageous students that just wanted to say hi in person... he he he... they said that my speech had moved them, that they really liked the message and all sorts of things... asking me questions and all... what was fun is that they couldnt' stop calling be as "usted"... which is waaaay to weird for me....  The speech was pretty much about passion in life, doing what you want, pursuing your dream, and silly things like that... but I think I managed to put it together in such a way that a senior highschool student could relate... and it worked!!... he he he... yay!....  So, back to inking and getting work done!... cheers people, life is good...  ps. soundtrack: "son de amoreeees".... (why?... why?!?!?!)

      If you can live with someone's past, then, my friend, that means you cannot live with your own. And if you are able to mess up something great, just because of something that "happened" in a time in which you were not even around, then my friend... you are the one with issues. And to be honest, I am talking about my self, about a mistake that I know I once made, how it messed my self and someone else up, and how childlish it all was...   Of course I see it that way now... and part of the whole idea is to not dwell on it, just to learn... which is something that I've done. But I just kind of "relived" it a little because of this movie I saw, and part of being authentic is being true to my feelings... and that my friends is how I feel... stupid and kind of angry with my self... good news is: it'll pass... as for now: fuck it!.  I don't wanna comment a lot on the movie, because it's worth watching and anything I could say would be a spoiler... of course the movie isn't new at all... but still. Some people are watching it for the first time even nowadays, take for example: me.  I wanted to see the movie because it's setup in the "comic book biz world"... which I thought was way cool... and the opening scene deals with an "inker" and the issues that come along the status, which was way appealing since I am starting to consider my self an inker now, and pretty much loving it. About that, the movie did fullfilled my expectations, I good to see a studio, the way those guys live, a little of that "world"... whatever... I loved it, and it reinforced the idea of me being a part of that, and me living in a cool studio working with my partners creating great stories.  The other thing though, the subject matter of the movie, is what moved me... and please do not get me wrong, I've never dated someone who was as "experienced" as Alyssa in this movie... but still I've gotten to feel something somewhat close to how Holden felt about her past, and how it kept haunting his mind and affecting everything else. It's messed up I'm telling you... But the dialogue of "silent bob" at the restaurant... man... the guys says little, yet every word is worth it...  We all [guys] want to feel the "one and only" in our girls life... and the thought of her past is something that haunts us... it happens, don't deny it. Still it's something we really don't want to know, but for some reason we have to... and when it comes... oh man, you better be prepared to deal with it.  Now I feel at ease with all that... and despite the fact that the movie "moved" me, I feel that I am "past that" and able to not even care... because in every aspect of my life I am living by the "here and now", and letting the past where it belongs. This 4 agreements book and all, it's all about living life that way...   And so be it... great movie though, it moved me, and I think it would move most guys who've been close to that situation in one way or the other. (I mean, let's not go as far as sex, even kissing a "girl who's kissed a lot" makes you feel insecure and compared at first). The Director of the film gets my respects, for touching such a personal topic in his life, and knowing how much he could impact the lives of tons of guys by letting them see such a mirror.  If you haven't seen it... go see it now please! (like renting, buying or whatever you must do).

      Have I mentioned before that I have music playing ALL THE TIME in my mind?... even if I am doing something else, even if I am talking with someone... anything, there is always some tune playing, and what is even better is that some of them are made up!... Some are so good that I wish I knew how to play the piano or something to be able to get them out of me... he he he... is that a common thing?... how many of you guys have the same thing going on in their minds?... Even now as I am typing I cannot help to be "listening" to a piece from the "10 things I hate about you" soundtrack. It doesn't mess things up, won't cause me to loose my attention or anything... it just happens... it's odd!.  Anyway, I had a great day today... which is quite something considering that I slept, again, only 3 hours... well... like 3:15... I don't know how I manage to stay this awake, but I know that my body is asking me for some rest... so, in a couple of hours once I get something done, I shall indulge my self with a movie (chasing amy) and some "coach potato" time.  So in the morning I meet Ana Lorena and had a great talk with her, which lasted for about 3 hours, and to be honest, I was amazed at the girl. She is soooo interesting, made me feel good to see that there are "others like me" in the female-variety... Just a nice talk, but to be honest, I had a good time while it lasted. Then, afterwards I went over to the bank and as I got my ticket and thought "damned" (because my number was like 197 and they were in 180), a friend of mine approaches and sais "hey hector, get my ticket, give me yours... now I am dealing with some stuff with the manager"... and there I was, it was 184!!.... he he he... yay!...  Then in the TEC I had a pretty cool day working with the clients from the "year book", had good laughs with them. And afterwards, since they were all girls, everybody from the CITE was making fun of me!... ha ha ha... for quite a while!... Specially Pau!... he he he... that girl is fun. So then the girls came back to make some adjustments, and there you can imagine the "smiles", the laugther and all the "carrilla" from them guys...   Pretty much, just to avoid all the details, I had a day full of smiles, laughs, great talks, work, and pretty much all I can ask for... and I feel great despite the fact that I have slept about 7 hours in the past 72... I know that my place is with people, I can't wait to get a laptop and be able to go work in different places, have talks, and have a "people enviroment"... freelancing at home is kind of cool, but it gets lonelly and I just am a social guy... he he he. That's why I think that my place in the comics world will be as a manager, a PR guy, or an editor... always creative, but making things happen among teams is my thing to do...   Now to get some things done... and then... a movie!... yay!...  **Cheers!  ps... the st is still that one song from "10 things I hate about you"... it goes like "I loooove you baaaaabyyy"... he he he... and it's just happy... maybe that's why I've got it.

      I do need to fix my schedule, this whole "freelancing / bunch to do" kind of life is messing up my mind and body, I do work better during the night, yet people live during the day... and so that I can do stuff with people, and work, I have been sleeping about 4-5 hours average for quite a while... it's starting to not work.  And damn, I hate to be always "on the run", I can't wait till the moment in which I can only devote my self to drawing, inking and coloring, not having to deal with other stuff to make some cash... hopefully that will happen soon... kind of like in the summer the latest... he he he. (If we do good in the  urlLink Comic Con  this summer, then it will be so!).  Last night at about 5 am (or was it early today?), flash decided to all of a sudden stop working!... I spent a couple more hours trying to figure out MY mistake, only to realize that it was flash who all of a sudden decided to die on me... great, it's not my mistake!... but still, I have no finished work, and it was supposed to be done today... ohhh yikes... dealing with clients is allways fun!...   Anyway, now I am working at the TEC and hopefully I will make this work in some computer around here... (i'm keeping my fingers crossed... and typing!... that's weird).  So cheers... got to keep on moving!... :-D

      There is a new link added on that bar in the left...  urlLink CYS (Count Your Sheep)  is probably the best e-comic I've bumped into in quite a while... if not ever.  I've read a lot of "geeky" fun comics, stuff I like, but this one has a deeper sense, and very very good dialogues... you have to check it out. It's starts  urlLink here , and READ THEM ALL... believe you me, the art becomes better everytime, and you will just fall in love with the characters.  **cheers.  ps. victor, my brother, was the one to introduce me to the comic... there, credit given... ok victor?... he he he.

      Not to be compared with the 4 noble truths...  The 4 agreements from the Toltec wisdom, are the basis for white magic, for owning your life and being 100% in control of it, and it's all in the mind and the way you relate your self to the world and, well, your self. The theory behind it all is very interesting, and the this book by Dr. Miguel Ruiz is a must read... not only by all those out there interested in mysticism and stuff of the sort, but by anyone who thinks their life could be somewhat better.  It's not about prayers or chanting, or anything like that... and when the author says "white magic" he doesn't mean Gandalf wearing white clothes... he means being in control, and using love as the tool to control your life, and how once you align your self to this 4 agreements, life starts to smile at you in every possible way since you are so aligned to it...   The 4 agreements are:  - Be impeccable with your words.     That talks about the power of the word, and how the way your     describe yourself and those around you IS the way your reality happens.  - Do not take anything personally.  - Do not make assumptions.  - Do always the best that you can do.  I am still reading the book, but finding it very very interesting... and what is even more interesting is that this "mexworks" course that I took is pretty much based in all those premises, and the dynamics and everything are meant to make you fully understand them, and make you live by those...   It's a good book, easily found, go check it out.

      Charlie, after all, did die yesterday... he was about 10+ years old, and a fine dog. But he was going through terrible suffering... his heart was 3 times the size it's meant to be... damn... Apparently boxers have problems with the heart once they get old, and although it wasn't apparent, charlie was kind of a boxer too... got to get the bad genes huh?...  My brother victor was devastated, so was my dad... they were death as he was put to sleep... poor charlie... victor cried a lot... charlie nicely fell asleep... went to that long eternal dream. All the while I was working, doing comics stuff, meeting a great guy who happens to be very good at drawing... and so it happened that I was away while charlie departed... my pain was lessened by all the work and good vibes I was getting from this guys, but there was pain nonetheless...  Fishes are now the only none-human living things at home... at least the only ones invited, because we tend to get the ocassional spider, and critters like that. I guess I will change their water, tend to them... anything to keep them alive please!!!...  On the other hand last night I had a blast... eventhough the night before I only slept for about 2 hours, I managed to be completelly awake, and I had a very fun time with Pancho, Blanco, Ireri, Ile and Victor... we did all sort of crazy stuff by chapultepec, several "leadership dynamics" turned into a lot of fun... he he he... things like one of us jumping from a step, us all catching him and them making him fly up the air and catch him over and over... he he he... at one point we ran out of those and went over by ireri's house, stayed by the fountain and took a buch of silly pictures with Pancho, Ile and Ireri... it had been a while since I felt like that... it was fun, just plain fun.  Now I have a bunch of things to do, so I might as well get them done... other wise the next few days will be quite a nightmare...  **Cheers!!!...  ps... eve lent me a couple of his "human torch" issues, drawn by Skottie Young... dude... he is my new idol...       and gabo is on town!... yay!!...        he he he...

      In order to get more work done today, I decided to NOT turn the messenger on at all... it's harder than I imagined!... I see the icon yelling at me, asking to be "double-clicked", and then I imagine all the good talks I am missing... damn... working at home it's easier because internet sucks, but being here, on a fast LAN... man... even just browsing searching for images is super tempting...   let's see if I manage to keep it off...  see ya...

      Today I was yelled at by my brother, he saw me and couldn't help saying that I am just not resting enough... which is somewhat true... The thing is, I've managed to make it happen all along, butthis past couple of days my body has been giving up... soon, say wednesday, I will take a day off and do nothing but rest and sleep... VERY IMPORTANT...   What else?...  yesterday was good... I wasn't able to get much work done at all!!... but it was good... he he he... at least a lot of fun with Pau (from the cite), and fun is good. Then in the evening I had a nice time with Hector and Enrique... it had been a while!. After that, just a little work, and then some sleep... damn.... the minute I closed my eyes (at around 1am), the alarm clock started making noise and it decided to say (6:30am).... man... that time flew by.  One of the interesting things yesterday with Pau was how we discussed the possibility of starting up a new religion... based purely on having fun!... without restrictive rules of "not doing this or that", just based on "true love", and well, true love would not allow anything messed up to happen... It's pretty much what Jesus came to say, just love each other, right?... Yet catholics and christians manage to focus on all the other things... (most of them anyway)... true love wouldn't allow anything messed up to happen. Anyway, the religion would be quite fun, and "white tenis" would be the sacred icon... which is waay cool right?...  He he he.... cheers people... now to get on with the day.

      Or  urlLink Van Helsing ...  during the first couple of minutes I just knew the movie was going to suck... the rest of the movie I kept wondering how much it could suck, and to be honest, I was surprised to see that indeed, once you think they've done all the "bad things" they manage to make it worst... I don't think it's an issue with the actors though, the director must have been high all the time, or just playing the audience a very very bad trick... there are several parts in which it is obviously terrible... so the director must have had some point in keeping it that way... or at least I hope so... point that, to be honest, I never really got.  ----  Ahhh!... good coffee... nectar of the gods... latelly I've been coming over to the TEC a lot, and to work in the cite... I love working at home, but I miss people sometimes too... It's a fact that during the next 3 months I WILL buy my self a laptop, that will give me the chance to work where ever I want... a mall, a coffee shop, my university, innox, anything... which is good. I really see myself as a PR guy, he he he he... and for that I need to deal with people right?... computers are easy in that matter.  On other news, yesterday I helped during the registration for the next "mexworks intro" in gda, it was fun!!!... less that a month ago I was on the other side, entering the intro and being all nervous... coool... he he he... it was nice to greet those guys welcome, and to know how their faces will look on sunday after the process... good for them. Anyway, I am making some money, but I need to make much more... so... let's see what we do about that.  *** Cheers!...  ps. on comics, still reading  urlLink preacher , which is f&%$ing great, and started to read  urlLink promethea ... I am loving the story telling so far.

      I think I've talked about it before... but it's just that I cannot stop to be amazed by all the magic around us, and how those guys managed to make us believe it's just "normal science"... I was working with this guy, and all of a sudden he send me some files, and all of a sudden they were in my computer.... now, that is something that we are "used to"... but to be honest he just triggered some magic simbols and doors while "clicking his mouse", thus conjured a spell that made those files appear in my computer...  And computers themselves are a pure artifice of magic... we are just so used to them... those guys are great... they made us believe so much on them, that since our mind is so set to this "science" the magic can be produced very easily... without that "disbelief" factor... Anyway... I am just sad that the guys from the fantasy faction couldn't make things happen like that, I would love to see dragons, fairies and elven folks around...  let's see what we can do about that.  So... why have I been away for such a long time?... the answer is GAP (Great Achievement Program), it's like the final stage of the course that I am taking, and to be honest I am quite liking it.... yet it's tiresome, and there are a bunch of things to do... it started this last weekend, and well... I haven't had that much time... but now I am stable, which is good.... he he he.  Because of this program I am going to do quite a lot of great stuff, that will reflect itself in the personal, professional, comunitary and inter-personal levels of my life... so, whatever is worth saying about it all I shall mention around here... he he he.  Anyway... now I gotta get something done, then go over to the registration, and then to the movies with gabo (happy bday gabo!).... he he he... long day!....  **cheers!  ps... urlLink  this guy  is veeery good...  (in terms of art and all).

      Apparently blogger.com now has the chance to "activate" some sort of comments section too... which is very cool, because now I wouldn't have to have an external provider (like haloscan)... to do that, and more things, I will deffinitelly browse around this new interface and check out it's goodies...  I've seen the new templates and they are good!... probably I will jump into one of those... but still, I want to make my own, I bet that if I chose "the best" around the new templates, it will also be "the most used" and thus less original.  What have I been up to?... a lot of work, and trying to balance things up!... between work, gap, my family, my friends, and being able to sleep, I am having an interesting time... right now I am keeping my self awake, so that I can be with 100% at an interview that I have at 4:00pm... he he he... then another one at 6, and by today I need to have the new page inked... those are my goals for the day... yay!.  (great!... a guy just told me that he has a check for me today!!!...)...  Now, I gotta go get that money, and make more things happen around here.  ** Cheers!!...

      Starsky and hutch are no more... again, I've lost a fish!!... :'(  Now we only have "Mr. T" left... and I don't think I will get another one for a while... (the new pair, if ever comes to be, will be called "bonnie and clyde"). It's weird, this japanese fishes are supposed to last a life time... and I've taken all the proper care... I wonder if it's about the lighting, something messed up with the food... who knows...  Still, I've satisfied this "need" of mine that told me to have a fish tank... now I know what it is like, and if it comes to that, I will happily remove it and give it away... fishes are very nice, but given the results, I am not great at taking care of them!!!... and I just get way too sad when one of them dies.  On other news, yesterday I went to Ajijic... I helped to sell tickets for a movie theater that will donate all of today's earnings to the charity that we are supporting!!... yay!... and it was fun. I had a good time inviting people by the microphone, but what I liked best, I think, was Ajijic!... it's a very nice little town!!... 80% of it's inhabitants are from another country (mostly USA and Canada), the traffic is very nice, the cost of living... and it has a lot of culture, artists, music, etc... I LOVED IT!!... I haven't been to Canada yet, but so far I think I've found one place where I would like to live... let's see how the comparison goes... but I loved Ajijic!... and it's only 40mins away from Guadalajara... so I can have all the "nice things" about a little town, and still be close enough to Guadalajara to enjoy the "richness" of a huge city once in a while...  Bla bla bla... I am rambling way too much... I guess I am avoiding all the work I've got to do!... (he he he).  Cheers!...

      I finished reading " urlLink the preacher " a few days ago... ohhh man... I got one of those "sadness" that you get after reading a good book for a while, and then it ends. By the end of the series I was so familiar with all the characters and conflicts, that now I just wish the series could go on and on.  Probably that's why some series, such as x-men, spider-man, superman, etc, have on-going issues and now they have hundreds of comics out there... he he he. Us fans sometimes just can't get enough. Still, I like this "short" series better... they are well put together, designed to begin and end, such as a good book. And whenever I feel like I need to "catch up" with the characters I can just get any issue and read it again... it's like a good book, you can re-read it several times.  Anyway, I loved the whole thing... the dialogues are awesome... quite heavy sometimes, but wonderfully written and put together. The story line is very interesting, and the art is as great and "mind-boggling" as the script itself. It's deffinitely a must read!.   At the time I am reading  urlLink promethea  and a series of spider-man ( urlLink Spider-Man Legend of the Spider-Clan ) illustrated by  urlLink skottie young . (yay!).

      I was going to post something interesting, I am sure of that... being that I have all this work, there was something worth saying... but now that I entered  urlLink blogger  I got kind of shocked!!!... the whole place is messed up and changed... not that you'd notice, but the thing is that this guys just changed everything around... I just feel like clicking all over the place, cheking out the new templates that they have available (there are a lots of them!), and just doing "time-wasting" things like that with my blog.  Yet, since "time to waste" is the least thing I have, I guess I'll let it be as it is, and then change it "one of this days".   I feel happy, excited, and full of energy!!... I just came back from the "graduation ceremony" of those guys who took intro-29 in guadalajara, and man... I love those things!!!... there are so many good vibes around the place, the hugging, the smiling, the dancing... I meet up with Memo there... wow... it was probably the nicest hug I've ever given to him over the years... I am sooo happy for him... good that he took the challenge, and got something out of it....  Hey!!... it just hit me... he he he. I was going to comment on saturday night!. After doing some GAP stuff, I called my brother, since we were supposed to do something together, and then we all went to a bar called "iguazu"... There were 5 of us, (joey, blanco, victor, pancho and I), and we just went to have a light fun time... At first it was, well, the usual... we sitting together by some table, talking about the girls but too nervous to approach them. ha!... At a point blanco and I went to talk by the terraza, and after a while we realized that Joey had already begun a conversation with several girls, and he kind of dragged us in there... now, I am not the kind of guy that likes hitting on girls, or meeting people over in a bar... he he he... yet I had a very very good laugh, I chatted with a girl named Valeria (or Niurka) and another one named Lourdes (or Belcebu)... the talk didn't last that long, since they had to go... but it was fun for a while, and it helped me feel "on the market" and all that... Sometimes I forget what it is to be "courting" a gilr, meeting them and all...   So... it was a fun night...   About today, we all in GAP choose the institution that we are going to help and man... it's going to be an awesome project. I will comment on that in some Post real soon, to give more details... but if ANY of you out there feels like they could help anyhow, any help is welcomed. Even all of you guys from another country!!... ok?...  **Cheers mates... good night...

      I am still trying to figure out why is the name of the movie " urlLink elephant "... Actually, in that link, there is a funny summary:  Lots of perambulation. A little killing ... he he he.  Either way, or despite it's weird name, the movie is good... Not "fun-good", or even "I wanna see it again-good"... but good. It's an interesting proposal... the lack of a soundtrack is notorious and gives the scenes a very tense atmosphere... which is, I bet, what the producers /director wanted. The movie made me think a lot of " urlLink bowling for columbine "... they could be sold in a set.  I think  urlLink elephant  has more of a "historical-reference" kind of air to it... even a documentary... it records one of those normal days in which something very unusual happens... very messed up too. And it even goes a little deeper, and tries to portray why do things happened. Still, it just displays the facts... it doesn't have, in my point of view, a huge proposition as of why things happened.  The idea that  urlLink bowling for columbine   has is a very good one... it's not about the violence in video-games, or an issue with gun control, or anything like that... it's about the "fear factor", about living in a society that is afraid of everything, and all this paranoia in the air causes nothing but violence. The Canadians, according to this movie, have tons of guns, watch violent movies, play violent games, but still, they are a peaceful, trustful society, and they don't have the amount of violence that the guys in the USA have...   Its all about the fear factor... and how filled USA is with it... fear, as we all should know, is probably the most destructive force in the planet... damn, it has managed to even beat love!!!... But as the guys from coldplay say "everything is not lost"...  ** ta ta!

      "and here I am trying to catch up with my self,   delusional between awareness glimpses and the  numbness of everyday nonsense..."  Life has been kind to me latelly, this new business is very interesting, it's about technology, 2nd place in the "entrepreneur" magazine, and it's pretty much about having a share of a huge international company. For some reason it came into my life at this moment... just when I was wondering how to make some good money...   Anyway, several interesting things have happened, one was that I was offered to teach 3 different groups in highschool next semester!!!!... teaching a whole new topic, that pretty much wants to make the students smart... The course wants to get the best of out them, teaching them reasoning, problem solving, creative thinking, and language ontology (zpelling?)... things of the sort. It's one of those courses that the guys can just "fly by", or one of those that can make a difference in someone's life. I am striving for the 2nd choice.   One of the "issues" is that Tanya, my ex-gf could be my student... now there is one to think about it. But I have talked about it with her, and just as I thought, it's all cool and there is no reason why we should make a deal out of it. Now the 2nd part is the way the highschool is, so strict... and the way I am... so "rebel" in terms of institution and all... he he he... there is the callenge. I guess I will take those classes, and it's not about the money, it's about the challenge and how much I will learn... this blog, of course, shall be a witness of all that happens.  On the other hand yersterday I had a talk with Abby!!!... wow!!... I loved it... it was pretty much "basic", but it was great to cross some words with her again. Just as I was writting her an email, she wrote me a message through msn. (I added her to my new list, and there she was!!). It may sound silly and all, but it was special to me. Mostly because of the way that I feel, of how much I've grown and "closed circles", and now I feel like I want everyone I've ever cared for around me... he he he. Too bad she's in Chicago, other wise I would invite her to have coffee and all... it's great to have a she-friend... he he he, and even better if you dated her, and now she's all about giving you tips and advices, and being a good friend. (it kind of happens with sara).  As well I had a great lesson today... I "wasted" about 5 to 6 hours going from a business to a business asking for a cooperation for "Casa Mision San Pablo" (the shelter with kids that have HIV), and I realized two things: 1) I wasn't making money... 2) I was fullfilling my idea of recognition, being seen, being smiled at, etc, etc... While apparently I wanted to make money, all I wanted was to be seen, trying to make money for this guys, and to be the "nice young fellow who has a great heart" in the eyes of others... Now this is a harsh judgement, but it's quite true!!... and once someone helped me to realize it, I changed the pattern and generated a whole event in a pretty cool place, and all the earnings from that day will be for the shelter!!!... now there is a difference...   It's all in the attitude... for real... whenever something is not going quite as planned, all you have to do is to stand, think, and realize what is it, deep inside, that is keeping you from achieving a goal, or which "stronger subconscious goal" is being a obstacle for this achievement. Weeeeird... but real... it's all in a metaphysics book!...  And to close, sarah, abby's sister, is having a baby!!... GOOD FOR YOU GIRL!!... YOU'LL MAKE AN AWESOME MOM... wow... keep it up... a huge hug for you!.  ** cheers then

      My days have been going so fast, that when I look back to see what I've done in every single one of them, I really can't believe it... Take this past friday for example, I had a meeting in the morning about some business, then another one at 12, then visiting 2 companies, then another meeting at 4, and then one at 8, and going to a bar at 11... he he he... of course, a lot of interesting things happened in all of those talks!!!... It's just that, man, living like this is kind of fun, since there is so much to do, my days are so full of experiences!... he he he...   Anyway, some of the highlights deal with businesses, and how, just when I was wondering how to make all the money that I needed, I was invited by one of the leaders in mexico to be a part of a huge international company, and start making some good cash on short term, and some huge cash on the longer run. I like that!... he he he... I think I may comment a lot more on that, in some other post... maybe. he he he.  Then again, one of the coolest parts happened on friday night. Victor, Kike, and I were wearing suits and all, because we went to a formal business meeting. But afterwards we just wanted to have fun in a bar. We were with Ireri, and then Blanco joined our party. The fun part was that blanco and ireri were very casual, and us three were super formal, with black suits, black shirts and all. So right before we came into the bar, we decided to make a formation:  Blanco and ireri were going to go as couples, and us three were acting as bodyguards... we looked serious, and even dangerous (believe it or not). Then we were doing this formations to go check everything out, then ask them to come, then wait, check the place out, etc. The minute we walked into the bar, everybody noticed us, guys and gals... the waiters got all nervous, and I don't think we have ever had such great service in our lives.   Of course Blanco was asked if we were his bodyguards, he said "yes" and then all the waiters were afraid of us... he he he. They gave them a huge table, (one for about 6 to 7 people), just for them two!. Of course victor, kike and I kept standing all the time. When we were asked if we wanted a drink we said "no" of course... and it's incredible!. They cleaned their table about 6 times, asked them every 5 minutes if everything was ok, and EVERYONE couldn't keep looking at us into our eyes!!... Even the hugest meanest guy would turn his face down the minute he made eye contact with me!!... he he he.  Of course lots of things happened... and it was fun... actually kind of a "social experiment"... great night...   Then yesterday I attended to what probably was the hugest wedding in my life... it lasted from 1pm to 1am... they served us great food!, and a great dinner too!... about 4 bands played, one with "covers" and cool music, and then a couple of Banda, of of them being "Banda San Miguel" or something like that... which I was told is kind of famous... they had "il caffetto" serving coffee, and ice cream stands, great drinks, the place was awesome, and the dancing was a lot of fun!!!... yay!... he he he... I was so tired this morning that I woke up till after 12... yikes. (still, the night before the weeding I slept only 3 hours, because we arrived home at about 2, and I woke up at almost 5 to work on inking and having the page done by 8, to take it to Eve's house).  Today seems like a good day... let's see how it goes.  **Cheers y'all!!!....

      Today I discovered that one of the most interesting women around is my aunt, and that i's a pleasure to have long talks with her... and that is something that I feel like I want to comment a lot on, but I want to comment to on how cool dory is, and how great is her "blessing"... so, 1st things 1st.  Dory, the "she-fish" from finding nemo, has such a great attitude!... I saw the movie the other day, and I saw it with the eyes of one that wants to disect the thing and learn from it... and I was amazed to discover all this awesome teachings... how you create nothing when your belief system is based on fear, and how fear and mistrust lead to nothing possitive ever... and aswell the power of having a great attitude!!... Dory has an "issue", her short term memory makes her the way she is, but it's awesome since she doesn't live in the past at all!... all she has is "right now", and she is always possitive about everything... all through the movie... and well, she pretty much achieves the greater deeds on the adventure when you think about it.  Why?... because she is not based on fear, and she doesn't live in the past... of course, she can't... but I think there is a lesson... Do we need to have the short term memory issue?... of course not!... but it would be great if we learn to just move on, and not let guilt, fear, and past "bad experiences" stop us from moving forward... and that is something we all tend to do, cling to a past we no longer control, we let it chain us down... keep us from growing... from trusting...   It would be great to be like dory, without having to have that issue...   -*-*-*-*  And well, today we had a meeting in my house with some family that we hardly see, and some friends... I had a great time with them all, we had wonderful stories, from the "harsh life of the left handed" to how my aunt had to go to the US and "steal" her children (my cousin) from my uncle... now, that is a complicated one, so we will let it be... he he he. I laughed with Laura because of her accident in the ship, and so on and so fort... but what I liked the most was to "meet" my aunt Alicia, a woman that I hadn't seen in over 12 years... and it was great to find out that she is an editor, teaches at the ITESO, and is probably the best conversation-pal I have bumped into in quite a long time...   It all started because she read a story that my brother wrote... she loved it, a lot... she was surprised, and amazed!... she even gave her card to my brother and sincerely asked him for more... that was awesome... but then she kept talking about reading and writting, and editing, and authors, and life, and metaphors, and books, and dude!... I was hypnotized!... I think I was part of a lecture that lasted about 2 hours, and I was totally into it and amazed... jeezzzz.... I hope we start seeing her more often...   -*-*-*-*-*  Everything is going great in every project... handling my self and my time as best as I can... the days are rich and full... that is good...  *** Cheers to you all!!... A HUG!!...

      The last time I wrote in this things was like... what?... two weeks ago?... damn... he he he. It happens all the time!, when I have the best things to say, I have the least time to write them down...   What have I been up to?... a lot!... putting my life together and in a great balance, doing all sorts of things to make all sorts of things happen, in everylevel of my life. It's all good, and I like that... Working out, hanging out with friends, a lot of work, comics, and even a better relationship with my parents... "successful people are the ones that have no free time, but give themselves time for everything"... he he he...   The new project I am into is called  urlLink IXP , is a company that provides internet services (ISP), e-commerce and an increasing number of services... and I am starting to make some good money out of it... in dollars!... :-) yay!... (if anyone clicks there, and is interested write me an email, I can give you all the details, and if you are interested we can make things happen for you too).  Still making webpages and flash stuff to get some cash, and working on comics harder everytime... karaokulta is experiencing a couple of problems, people related, which is good, because companies grow from those. One of the issues with creative teams is that, after all, everybody has a very different "take" on the final product, and we all have to learn to be flexible and accept someone else's work... anyway, I know it will work out.  Aswell working a lot in several things... helping that shelter with sick children... and having some great talks with a couple of friends... Every day I realize how powerfull we all are, and how we tend to use that power against ourselves... if we could all believe in what we dream of... we'd be living a whole different kind of life.  **Anyway cheers!... I miss you blog... he he he... but keep in mind that I do think of you often...  bye there.

      I love that period of time right before falling asleep... the one that comes as you wake up is interesting too, but there you start getting back into the real world, and somehow you  control  it.  But no, that time before giving in to morpheus is another story... actually, I always try to remember when was it that I just fell asleep and, to be honest, I can't... minutes before I remember, but the exact time in which I lose my self into my subconscious is always too blurry.  Still, when I am still conscious, I know that my ideas are messed up... the way I perceive reality changes a lot, all my senses get confused. I wonder if they don't know wether to focus on "the real thing" or the world to come once I close my eyes for the night.  A couple of days ago I remember waking up, getting some alerts on my radio and calling back a couple of people, I started planning my day, doing this and doing that... and then, all of a sudden, I woke up for real... and I was there again on my bed... my radio had no alerts, and no be honest I didn't know if I had called those persons or not... how late it was, or how much I had planned of my days... that happens a lot...   I tend to blend those realities...   And eventhough I like both of them, I really really love the feeling of being "inbetween"...  **cheers

      As for this very second, if you type "hector padilla" (the "quotes" are not neccesary) in google, my link is the one on the very top. yay!!... I really don't know how google gives the "spots", but I'm there... so there you go "hector padilla's" in the world... I am #1!!!!... he he he... at least for a while... it works with "hector loco" and things like that too... :-P  Anyway... after those seconds of "ego"... have I comment already about the " urlLink Venom " comics?... well, they are quite good. Actually it's a story about the bad guy, and you follow his lead... in a way you get to empathize with him, which is messed up... And, as far as I know, it's the 1st comic that I've read that focuses on the bad guy... kind of.   What I liked is that the story is good, and a lot of the work is done by mexicans...a least the art work... the pencilers, inkers and colorist have been mexicans for most of the issues!!!... yay!!!... (now skottie is the penciler in the current issues, but I love skottie so it's ok)... there is something about great comics by mexicans that just make me smile!!... he he he.  Damn... I know I have a lot to share, but now someone really really wants to use the computer... anyway, life is good... it has a decent smile at the moment. :-)  ** cheers  ps. And now, here is another poem by Mario Benedetti... (that guys rocks)  Pasatiempo  Cuando éramos niños los viejos tenían como treinta un charco era un océano la muerte lisa y llana no existía.  Luego cuando muchachos los viejos eran gente de cuarenta un estanque un océano la muerte solamente una palabra.  Ya cuando nos casamos los ancianos estaban en cincuenta un lago era un océano la muerte era la muerte de los otros.  Ahora veteranos ya le dimos alcance a la verdad el océano es por fin el océano pero la muerte empieza a ser la nuestra.

      -Mario Benedetti    Tengo miedo de verte necesidad de verte esperanza de verte desazones de verte. Tengo ganas de hallarte preocupación de hallarte certidumbre de hallarte pobres dudas de hallarte. Tengo urgencia de oírte alegría de oírte buena suerte de oírte y temores de oírte. o sea, resumiendo estoy jodido y radiante quizá más lo primero que lo segundo y también viceversa.    ps. you gotta check  urlLink this guy  out.

      Once I slept in my brother's room because there were like 3 guys in mine, so I ended up sleeping in his floor... (one of those "anime/video games" nights I bet)... the thing is that I saw that he leaves his blinds open, which somehow "iluminates" the room with whatever amount of light the stars and moon are willing to offer at the time. I liked the idea, and ever since I've been doing it too... you not only get embraced by the moon light, but you aswell wake up early when the sun is up there... kind of nice and cocky if you think about it...  Anyway, last night I couldn't stand it... I had to close those blinds.  The sky was red... a real bright orange with a twist of red, and I couldn't really tell why... for some odd reason I just couldn't fall assleep at all... and the color of that sky kept freaking me out... are we talking about energy issues?... maybe... sometimes I am sentitive to those things... but man... I had to close those blinds... and read and read to distract my self from the real world... books are good... and whenever you've had enough of them you can close them... not like real life.  So that was then...   Now I am happy and working, and I just read one of the best comics I've read in a while... I can't believe the writter, he's a genius... and the art rocks!... he he he... it's terribly funny and smart. The name is  urlLink "I feel sick" ... check it out if you can... it will be worth every cent, and minute you invest on it.  Anyway... keep on working.  **cheers

      feeling down and feeling sorrow, wonder when's comming tomorrow, in rainy days of self, it's all despair...  life my friends has a way to resemble a rollercoaster... but not one of love, but one filled with all sorts of emotions, tremendous turns and it's huge amount of ups and downs... am I feeling down at the moment?... not really, just thoughtfull... I still struggle a lot with my parents, and I know for sure that I am not even close to what they'd what me to be... the thing is that I don't want to be that hector...  I am feeling rather happy with the way my life is going, but I see how it conflicts with my parents, and damn... that sucks. This next week I'll see if I can find a spot in between... one way to be ok with them, and fine with my self... you know which is the saddest part?... It's about the money... the same problem... just money. If I was making lots of it, I don't think they'd be worried at all...   Anyway... we'll see... if anyone knows of a part time job around the area, let me know... I could make things happen with one of those... but full time?... oh man... not full time... that would kill all my projects... all the things that I know I want for real...  We'll see.  **cheers.

      I am again living one of those stages in which I can pretty much go on and on with just a couple of hours of sleep everyday... which is good because I get a lot of things done, but I just know it won't last... he he he  Anyway, the other day something happened that, to be honest, makes me wonder about starting to work right now. The other day I was inking this page, being happy about it and all, and all of a sudden it started raining, some thunders... the usual things in Guadalajara in this nice time of the year. So, what happened was that the day after, when I tried to open my file, I couldn't!!!... IT WAS MESSED UP!!!... at the moment in displayed no errors or anything, but I thing some lightning or the ups and downs in the current messed it up... and yes, I lost like 8 hours of work... sucks huh?  Life is going fine... money issues like usual, but life is looking brighter on that side everyday... ixp is starting to pay, there are some projects comming up... ahhh... man... time goes by so fast!!... I can't believe I am going to Canada the next week... dude, I am so afraid, I am living so many things undone and unfinished... anyway, I'll get the best out of this trip, and once I am there, I will trully enjoy being there...   Ah yes!!.... in comics I just read the DNA manga, which is quite good and fun, and the 1st book of Promethea... WOW... you ought to read it... the art is good, but the story telling and the writting rocks... allan moore is sooooo THE MAN... And is deffinitelly a treaty about magic and the power that we all have within... I will deffinitelly try and collect all of the books. (and I am reading sandman again... wow too).  So cheers... I'll try and get some work done... he he he  ps. by the way, I am using the  urlLink IXP  dial-up service and it is indeed much faster and better than the regular one!!... yay!.

      I am tempted to delete the previous post, but I won't because it's quite amuzing... just know that the "real" post is before that one. I don't know why but blogger messed things up and it posted the thing twice, but once with some entry by some other person... he he he... I will just leave it there because it's funny... but believe you me, I've written none of that.  So my reald post of titled  And so the story ends...  can be read after right after the messed up one... ok?...  **Cheers.  (I only wish I could know who's blog got mixed up with mine, and if theirs his/hers showed the same messed up results than mine...)

      So again it happened, that a great book is finished reading and it's magic is, althought still lingering in my self, starting to fade away... It always happens with good books, you can't stop reading them, and craving to get to the end, but again, you can't stop feeling down once you've done reading them... you wish they could go on forever... like that moment of a sweet kiss, or the smell of a hot cup of chocolate.  But as everything they end... and eventhough they wait there on the shelf to be read again, and they will, it's a fact that life goes on and their magic, as great as it was, is not really a part of our "real world".  I just finished reading " urlLink American Gods ", a book by  urlLink Neil Gaiman . And by the feel of my words you can tell that I liked it, and I disliked the fact of being thrown away out of that magical world once I stopped reading what weutes before I need to get to work ? 6:30 am wakeup makes me be in bed by 10 The stereo in my car ? a crackly FM modulator for the ipod works, but it?s not the same The stereo in my house - though this altec lansing speaker set for my ipod actually sounds ok in this little apt, they?re no substitute for big floor speakers and a 15? powered sub. A fat steak and a bunch of beer on Thursday night at Outback ? don?t miss going to work on Friday after that though Crawfish ? I can?t remember when crawfish season ends, I hope it?s still around when I get back Southern words like ?y?unt-to?? and ?aight? - yeehaw Having a 5 minute drive to work ? this goes hand in hand with the whole not having to wake up early thing A king size bed - they call what I have here a king size, but it?s only a double by American standards That amazing machine that washes your dishes for you ? apparently they haven?t moved into the 20th century over here yet Not having to bend over to get something out of the fridge ? the whole unit over here comes up about to my neeples.

And by the feel of my words you can tell that I liked it, and I disliked the fact of being thrown away out of that magical world once I stopped reading what were the last few words. Yet I thank the chance that I had of peeking into that magical place for while it lasted.    urlLink American Gods  is a must read, and to be honest, you enjoy it even more once you know something about world mithology... still, you can just go ahead and read it nonetheless. I must confess that I prepared my self for this book, and before reading it I read a lot about classic and nording mithology, and a little about world folklore, etc. Once I read those things I read couple of other unrelated books... (I guess that's when I read Borges and those guys). Still there were a lot of references that I didn't catch, but it's nice to see "familiar faces" in such odd cotexts of our real world.  What is it about?. About Gods, and what they are doing nowadays in a land where they are hardly ever remembered, and even less frequently taken seriously. The story of a regular guy that finds himself trapped in very unregular circumstances, and somehow ends up being the guy who runs errands for some Gods, and who, by the end, does quite more that his share for the divine folk.  Read it... you won't regret it... the only possible "side effect" is that you won't be able to see the world again and you used to, and magic will be in every corner wheter you like it or not.

      Yesterday I was playing cuban dominoes, there were 4 of us, and I am amazed at how my brain relates thoughts ideas and memories, all of a sudden I remembered about the other time in which I had played that game with only 4, and that was waaay back in Russ's house. (Russ is Abby's dad, Abby used to be my girlfriend)... he he he... and then I started thinking about the 1st time I meet him, and man... I couldn't help but smile. It was my first "meet the parents" experience, and it was quite heavy to be honest... he he he... since I was going to stay in their house and all.  Anyway, I wonder what triggers certain thoughts and memories... and it they are "stored" there all the time, or maybe some "idea" makes them be "formed" in out brains... like... are my memories stored somewhere?, or just enough info to rebuilt them when required?.  One other thing that was discussed was the possibility of starting our own sect... he he he... after a while we came to the conclusion of just starting some group or people interested in studying metaphisics and things of the sort, and share thoughts and ideas. Later on, if we find some interesting truth and path, then we may go forward with the original plan... (he he he... jk... ?)  So in a couple of days I am going to Canada, and I have so much left to do that I just don't know how in earth I'll manage to do it... anyway, we will see... and it will, of course, be solved. My life just gets terribly tangled up and for some odd reason, at the end, it all works out... in the meantime though, I give my self the chance to be all stressed out.  he he he...   **cheers!!

      I think that my previous post was pretty lame, since, to be honest, it does nothing but to describe a bunch of "blah" events... they do seem blah because I wrote in a hurry and there is no emotion to them... yet for me it's a good compilation of what went on, and thus I can remember the cool part of those events...   Yet it's nice to say that the camp was pretty cool because I got to meet this guys, and had pretty interesting talks with a couple of them. Like most international students I have know they are pretty nice people, you learn to be open like that when you are on a new country... you need allies after all.  Right now I am waiting for Sandra and Daniel to come back to the apartment, and so we can go out to a "nice jazz night"... it will be fun, I am worried because I have some work to do for the tec, but I am aswell sure that it will be done either way, so I might aswell enjoy my time... I won't sleep probably, but it won't be the last time I do that. Actually, last night I couldn't fall asleep... I have all this ideas on my mind... It's nice... I like it... but it's hard... I wasn't anxiety what I felt, yet there was enough information running through my brain that it just couldn't get into "sleep mode"...   (by the way, I went to yet another comic books store, and I found yet again a bunch of comics that you don't easily get in mexico, including a couple of sandman figures - of dream himself- and things of the sort... I wonder if I'll have any money by the end of my stay to be able to buy all that nonsense).  So monday... wow... the dawn of an old era I must say for real...  On monday morning I woke up at about 8, and took off the house with Daniel rather early, we had a very good cup of coffee in a nice coffee shoppe, and then took the bus. That bus drove me to  urlLink BioWare , my 1st time in a real video game company... and not just "any" company, there is a reason why this guys get  urlLink this amount  of awards after all.  I was nervous and terribly excited... when I walked in there... man... that was something... as you walk in you see a stand with tons of prizes and awards, the nice lady registered me, and then daniel walked me down a corridor. To my left was a huge stand that had all sorts of books related to art, human body, architecture, writting and all those things... -those are the books we no longer use- daniel told me.  Then the 1st "office" I saw was this HUGE lounge that has a ping pong table, a pool table, 3 futbolitos, and several couches and sofas in front of a TV that has all the imaginable consoles, controles, and game cases... right next to it was the kitchen, filled with oranges, bananas, apples, muffins, an fridge filled with ice cream, and every thing was "laying there to be taken"... That, I was told, is the place they go to chill and relax from work... (at this moment I started going crazy).  At a point it all begun and so I meet the guys that are working on Jade, a game yet to be released, and some of the folks from "dragon age", which is a game that is "highly classified" and from which I wasn't allowed to see a lot... yet everything would resemble Jade's stuff sort of... I meet the "technical artists" which are a bunch of guys that make it possible for the programmers and the artists to work together, and talk to the head guy for quite a while, then I meet the game designers, the testers, the graphic programers, the senior programers, the division that programs the fights... man... TOO MUCH!!!... I was right in the guts of a video game, and not only did I get a cool "BioWare" mug, I got all this insight to what goes on right when they are building a game... man... I don't think I will be ever able to see a game the same way... probably what happens when you see a naked woman for the 1st time... he he he... no woman is ever the same again!.  I had lunch with some of the game designers and it was cool, all this guys have the terribly different backgrounds, the only thing they have in common is that they can tell a good story... (that's what a game designer does, they decide what happens when, who meets who, the quests and all that... they are the ones who make the game interesting after all). Emmanuel is a friend of Daniel, one of the designers, and a pretty interesting guy... today he gave me some time to just shoot all sorts of questions at him and ask him for professional advice, and for help... he was more than nice answering all my questions... he he he... Although he is sarcastic and you can tell he is always thinking something funny or strange, he is a french guy with a great black humor. He used to work in marketing and earn a bunch of money, but at a point decided that it was boring and so he started to do what he always wanted... video games... (AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!... GETTING CRAZY HERE!!!!).  Anyway, yesterday's visit at BioWare was a great experience... probably a life changing one. At a moment it was time for me to go home and leave Daniel to do some work... so I did and when I arrived home, Sandra invited me to the University and she gave me a tour around it. I loved it... the buildings are awesome, they have all sorts of cultural classes, the sports building rocks, libraries, labs... it's huge, yet "packed" so you don't have to walk that much between buldings... (not those 15 minutes walks like in macomb... mostly because of the cold... I am told that there are days here in which, if you throw a bunch of hot water to the air, it will fall as ice to the ground... your hot coffee just bought from star bucks will freeze in secods if you are out in the street... sheeesh... that's a little too much).  Later I went back to BioWare, just to meet Daniel there, and then we went to his  urlLink Taiko  class... It was sooo interesting, I love percussions my self, but this was more like a martial art. Hey had all this moves as they played... Daniel was rehearsing in a room with the "new guys", but then I went to see the more experienced ones and I was perplexed by their skill and the sound of it...   Something that sucked though is that I lost my backpack there... he he he... or at least I left it... forgot it... oh well...   After the class Daniel and I felt like watching a movie, but since we couldn't find anything nice, we went out for a beer. It was nice because there were no bars open, so we walked A LOT looking for one, which was just an excuse because the better part of the talk happened while walking. He told me some things of his travel to japan, and then we talked a lot about philosophy... man I had missed those talks with him. At some point we did find a bar and stayed there for a while, there we both came up with pretty good ideas... ahhhh... I wish I could tape those talks sometimes.  At some point we came back, talked a little more with Sandra... and tried to fall asleep... I couldn't though, yet I rested... but visiting BioWare is messing up my mind... he he he... I need to decide on several things, and it would be nice if I can do it while I am here.  Today I woke up, took a bath, and started working in the computer, at a point Daniel called and told me that Emanuel was willing to give me an hour to talk about game designing and all my questions, so of course I took the chance and went to BioWare... that's the talked that I already described in some previous paragraph)... Later we played ping pong for a while in the lounge, and I meet Jason, the senior graphics guy, who gave me a spot for tomorrow... with him I shall have a talk like the one I had with Emanuel, but about his field of specialty.  Right now I am just waiting in a computer lab close to sandra's and dan's place... thinking a lot... but mostly, deciding and getting somewhere...   **Anyway, cheers...

      My 1st day was fun, I was tired since we went to bed after 4am in the morning, yet I was able to wake up at a decent time (about 10, he he he)... the night before daniel had drawn a basic map of the main street over here, or at least the nicest street, and so I decided to walk all the way through it and get to know the place.  I loved walking down that street, it has so many different kinds of stores... like really, from one called "decadence" that has all related to marihuana (I don't think it has the actually weed though), to ethnic stores, gothic stores, comics stores, irish, scottish, and all sort of funky places... Canadians are nice, and some girls are VERY good looking, but I would say it's average... not like what Tomas sais about eastern europe at least.  There are a lot of "freaks" walking down the street, girls with multicolored hair, gothic looking ones, and all sorts of guys too. There was a carwash in a corner that was literally filled with girls in tiny bikinis... and they would wash your car like that!!!... damn... I wish I had a car... I was tempted to ask them to wash me... but then again I am shy like that... he he he.  I walked for about 15 blocks until I decided that I wasn't going to find a place to buy candian dollars going towards that direction, that's when I just turned bank and walked into the 1st bank I saw. The guard was very nice when I asked him if I could exchange - currency in there, he said -oh wait a minute- then came back and said -it'll be just a minute - .... I waited for a little while and then the manager of the bank came and asked me what I wanted and everything, I kind of got weirded out and said "well I just wanted to know if it was ok for me to exchange some dollars here"... and all of a sudden she said, with a huge smile, "of course!, don't worry, there is no problem, we will help you... "... and so they did...  Another messed up thing is that here the pedestrians have the preference, so if you are walking ANYWHERE the cars stop... if a car is like 2 meters away from the corner and you are about to walk by, they completelly stop... at 1st I would look at them in disbelief but once I noticed that there weren't going anywhere unless I crossed the street I started doing it... which means that you can pretty much walk around everywhere without looking!!!!... because they will, for sure, stop... Daniel says that he is very worried, because he's gotten so used to it he's almost sure he will be killed by a car once he comes back to mexico... he he he.  So I walked a lot and went to a comic book store... yay!!!... IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME!!!... comic castle is nothing compared to it... I had to put my self together in order to avoid expending all my money there... so many toys, rare comics, clothing and all!!... I found a "squeak" doll, a lenore doll, a lot of clothers, so many comics... damn, I wish I had all the money to buy those things... It was fun at the store because apparently I did everything that I am not supposed to be doing... I walked in with my backpack on, I went behind the counter and what not... oh well...  Later on the evening I went with sandra to a mall to buy tenis shoes, I got a great deal and bought a sketchers pair for only 37 canadian bucks... which is very cheap!... after that we went to a super and there I met Paco, Juliana and Karla... those were some of the guys that I was going to go camping with... we bought stuff, what not... they were a nice bunch indeed.  At a point I went to Pancho's house where I met like 20 other guys, since that was the gathering point... most of them were latins, some from colombia, peru, and mexico, but there was a girl from quebec (which is like another country), a girl from spain, and a couple of canadians. We jumped into the cars and drove for like an hour till we came a cross a beautifull camping park... IT WAS SO NICE... the weather was warm and sunny, all those trees, walk paths, and it all was by a huge pretty lake... it was like a "dream site"... fiddlers green kind of... and there were camped.  The camp site had showers and bathrooms, running water, etc... so in the 1st world you always get your services even if you are into a "wild" weekend. During that day I had fun with most of those guys, helped build the tents, put on a fire, etc... that night we stayed up till about 5:00 am... singing, drinking, and having a blast... After going to bed were probably some of the worst hours of my life... I WAS FREAKING FREEZING!!!... I really was... you know how it's always colder when the sun is comming out?... damn... I was shivering!!!... still...  The next day we were all up by 10 or so, and after breakfast we went to the lake... the lake is very very larde, I couldn't see the other end in several spots, and there were a lot of trails to follow to get there which are pretty nice. A funny thing was the concept of sunbathing in Canada, and how most people was doing it... just wearing a swimsuit and laying on the "beach" getting some sun... kids playing in messed up cold water... etc... Even I got a tan... it was weird because comming to Canada didn't resemble anything like that in my mind... this was more like "puerto vallarta meets mazamitla"... yet it was a lot of fun.  Of course a lot of great talks happened... tons with Daniel, but I had a couple of good ones with other guys like Gil, Guillermo, Jose Ramon, Frederika, Rebecca, Scott, Greg... etc. It was nice.   That night was colder though, and so most people went to bed no later than 3am... but still it was a great time by the fire while we all were at it... more than 20 guys and girls close together singing stuff and telling jokes by the campfire... drumming with the "garrafon", etc. At the end there were only 5 of us (gil, memo, greg, rebeca, rocio and I) who stayed up till after five... we had a blast telling all sorts of jokes.   The day after we all had to wake up early and put the tents down etc, because we had to be out by 12... (really, like in a hotel)... so we did, and then went over to "the beach" to have one last time in there... at about 4pm we came back.  Daniel, Sandra and I were so freaking tired... but still, we managed to get showered and in the mood to go out for dinner... and so we went to a great thai place they have in town... spicy exotic food!... yay!!... of course, that night we stayed up late talking. Daniel showed me all his pictures from his latest trip to Japan... wow... those pictures were so neat, but even better was the story behind them all... ahhhh... the world is such a huge place, I WANT TO SEE IT ALL!!!...  Argh... so that was a huge "summary" of the weekend... he he he... honest, that's what happened... how I felt?... ahhh... that should be discussed on a post of it's own... let's just say that my mind is working non stop for real...   ** cheers and love... take care

       (originally written by hand...)   It's almost fear, one of those times in which you feel a lot, but cannot really tell what's going on inside... adrenaline rush... of course it's not the 1st time I've flown across the country or taken a plane, but still it's always the same... the feeling of walking through those gates that separate the "loved ones" and the ones that are going away. Walking down the aisles, looking for the proper gate.... and then... the waiting.  Some people sleep it over, they may not really be tired, but they just numb their anxiety by sleeping and this separating themselves from the comming reality... they are "leaving on a jet plane", such an innatural thing if you ask me... still, they have managed to convice us all that it's feasible, so we believe... and so it can fly.  I wonder what else could we do if we could just believe on it collectibly...  ... Always hated saying goodbye... that's why I didn't do it with most people in my life... I said goodbye with a hug to my mom, dad and my brother... that is always bitter sweet, I know it's only for a couple of weeks, but still, there is always "that" eerie feeling, that just doesn't let me let go that easily.  (I miss my computer... a keyboard, writing by hand is o much slower... looks kind of cool though, but still).  The waiting room is pretty much empty, I was planning on sending a bunch of text messages  through my cell phone to a bunch of people, but there is no reception here... I bet it won't work in Canada either... I will use it as a watch at least. (I don't like having things around my wrists).  ... I don't want to stop writting, because it's the one thing that is keeping me sane... awake. But I will because I am not making any sense... I'll try and read or maybe "sleep it off" just like everyone around me.  -----------  The plane got, after all, filled... yet I don't think it was such a great acomplishment since it's one of the smallest planes I've ever seen. When I saw it I though it could probably make it to Puerto Vallarta or some place close like that... but houston?... man I am kind of having second thoughts about it...  So far I've had cool conversations with a nice old lady (there is always one around) and which a cool girl that felt the same way about the size of the plane... he he he... it was fun to talk about it... now let's see how the darn thing flies.  ------------  After a while the little guy did it... I believe there was some turbulence at a point, and they served some kind of meal too, but I trully couln't tell since I was asleep most of the time. (I guess I didn't miss that gb game after all, right alex?).  Now, arriving to another country is always fun, but it's even better when you get to houston at 8:30 and your next plane leaves at 8:44!!!!... now that's exciting.  You have to go through customs, inmigration, get your luggage, put it somewhere else, and then RUN LIKE CRAZY in one of the largest airports in the world... (gasp.. gasp... damned asthma!!)... but I made it!!... yay!!!... (gasp).  This plane is so much larger, does feel like a plane...  -------------  There is something about flying at night that I just love... all those flickering lights down at the ground... people, lives being lived. I focus in a point and see a dad getting home after work, in another an angry woman is yelling at her husband, and right over there is a party with a bunch of teens, one of them wants to declare his love tho the girl in the couch... but he won't... (sigh). There are  some sad lights too, for some reason I know there is an uncle molesting his nice right there, and over there a grown man is crying like a child, holding the hand of his dead father next to a bed in the county hospital. But such is life and such is humanity.  When isee all those lights from up above I unverstand why God made us, we are so amusing. And aswell I can't stop thinking that, just as a bunch of cells make an organ, the lot of us make a larger system. Being a part of the system makes it hard to tell which is it that we are, but I just know it. Just like my liver's cell aren't aware that they are part of my liver, and they just "are" as best as they can, I think we humans just are... I wonder what we are though.  It's hard to fall asleep knowing that there are so many lights to feel... during the day youy see an "earth" colored ground, with greens and browns all over the place... it's at night when our prescence becomes apparent, coloring with bright lights places that would other wise be surrounded by darkness.  ------------  Yay!!... I made it to edmonton!!!... new country!!!...

      Being back in Guadalajara has been rather harsh... I believe even my body didn´t like it since I am getting this sort of flu... and to he honest all I am thinking is a way to make it so that I can go back there... is it an escape?... going away from my house and it´s "issues"?...   Whatever, but I'd like out... and I really liked what I saw over there...  Still... much to do for the time being...  ps. the 2nd trade paper back of promethea is very good, I can see though that most people won't enjoy it, but I can think of some guys that I'd like to discuss it with (allan, memo, daniel...). The 1st is good, and by the end is very good... but the 2nd is a whole other thing.

      Monday was one of the most "eye opener" days during my stay in Canada. Early in the morning I went walking and what not, went to a bookstore, etc. But the real good thing happened at 2:30 when I meet two guys from the graduate department of computer sciences in the UofA (University of Alberta), they were really nice and fun, and so they told me a lot about what goes on in there... (they were john and nathan). At 3:00 pm I had a meeting with Pierre, who was Daniel´s supervisor, and who showed all of his projects... wow... I couldn´t believe there was such a place, it´s like the convergence of art and technology all in one place, a "somewhere" that allows a singer to make her thesis about how virtual characters react to her voice, and things of the sort... so much about virtual reality, inmersive worlds, intellingent characters and mazes... all!... I had a great talk with this guy, to be honest, now I feel like studying a masters is not such a bad idea after all. He gave me about and hour, so at about 4:00 I joined John and Nathan again, and they showed me all of the facilities, and everything that goes on in the department...   the walk back to the apartment was, of course, on filled with thoughts...  then I went with Sandra to the West Edmonton Mall... Some say it´s the largest in America, I will just say it´s pretty darn big. It has it´s own Chimulco inside... (yes, a great acuatic park), it has several places with live animals like flamingoes, a huge artificial river with all sorts of cool things (like pirate ships and stuff), and you can go in an underwater ride through it, by a submarine of course. Over there I bought some stuff for my family, and had a pretty nice talk with Sandra. So nice actually that we came back when we realized it was 9:00 pm!!!...  Back at home we meet with Daniel, had some dinner, chatted, and saw a movie called "hero"... very good movie, with a decent story, but an amazing photography... that´s what makes it worth watching.   On tuesday I went to buy some books, to the univertisity to ask for information and forms, and then I had lunch with Daniel with some guys from BioWare. This guys are the ones that are in charge of the combat sistems, the cameras, collisions and things of the sort. It was great to meet them, talk to them, and realize what is it that they did to end up working there... I feel like I have so much inside info!!!... During the meal they talked about all this problems, and it was fun to see all the things hey have to deal with, and try to come up with solutions in my head.  Hmmm... after the meal I had a nice coffee with Daniel, and then we went to BioWare, there Daniel had a couple of gifts to me!!!... yay!. One of them being an art book, but the coolest part was that we went to meet a bunch of the artist who did all that stuff, and had them sign it!... yay!. he he he... I felt like such a little kid (just as happy).  What did I do afterwards?... yes!... I went back to the apartment, and then with Sandra to visit Mariel, Omar and Gabriel... that was nice and fun, gabriel is a fun-cute little baby... he he he. A little later I meet up with Karyn, emmanuel's wife, and she drove me to the movie theater were we meet Daniel and Emmanuel. It was so much fun!!... the drive over there was cool, she is a very fun interesting woman, and when we got there it got even better. Emmanuel makes me laugh so much, he has such a keen black humor... he he he. So we saw spiderman 2, BioWare bought the entire display for the company so the room was filled with guys from over there (an odd bunch they all). After the movie we went to Daniel´s apartment where we meet sandra, and had a pretty nice dinner. We all cooked creppes, (they are not that hard to cook at all!), and had a nice talk and some good laughs.  After some time Emmanuel and Karyn left, and so Daniel, Sandra and I were left to say our goodbyes... **sigh**... On wednesday I woke up early in the morning and took the shuttle that was going to take me to the airport... Daniel walked me over there, and well... it was a nice good bye.   The travel back home was good and without much hassle, enough time to transfer and all...  It was a great trip... so much in my mind... but all good.   I LOVED IT... (thanks Daniel!... thanks Sandra!).  Now let´s see what happens next.

      I can still remember...  Man, to be honest I feel tired just when thinking about the idea of writting everything down... but since this past wednesday so much has happened. I AM LOVING IT HERE!.  Ok well, probably one of the nicest thigs was my interview with Jason, he is the Senior Graphics Programmer and a VERY nice guy... we were supposed to meet on tuesday but he cancelled, and he was SO upset about it!. He he he... still, the interview did happen, and it happened in the "Knights of the Old Republic" room... yay!!... they have several meeting rooms, each one with a different theme, and they are like nice living rooms with great couches and all... anyway, we talked for about 45 minutes or so, and he was pretty pacient and answered all my questions. I get the picture now of what a graphics programmer does, and to be honest, it's quite interesting... it's a technical job, but still, it's based in creativity, and very visual too... you are always working with art, and artists... hmmm... it's hard to explain.  Anyway, so he told me what he looks for in a person, studies, knowledge, attitude, etc... in a way, I felt like cheating because he was giving me all this great insights before I would aske him for a job... he he he. But still is very cool, and even better was that, after the talk, that pretty much turned into a nice conversation by the end, he gave me his card and said that he would be willing to help me during my process... wheter it was a masters, or anything else... wow....  I still haven't gotten over that talk... and actually I've done nothing but thinking about a cool thesis to write during my masters!!... ha ha ha ha... funny how things work.  That same day I got to spent the whole time in BioWare, I stayed in the rec room, watched tv, played a little, read a lot, drew, had some soda... man, I wish I had gotten some ice cream... but that is sacred you know, and stealing their ice cream just didn't seem right. he he he... still, I really liked the "ambience" over there.  After that we went to the Taiko class, which was great because the next day a show was going to be presented so they rehearsed the whole thing and I got to listen and so some pretty nice things. It's so serious and martial... so nice.  Then we went to some club close to white Av. to a "good bye" party... it was SO MUCH FUN!!... Daniel and I did drank more beer than usual, he he he... so we had this great philosophical "merry" talk about life and all... and of course, we had to cheer for raistlin. At a moment we all went inside to the dance floor, and thus became the kings and queens of the night. We danced for about 3 or 4 hours non stop... and by the end several Canadians were just partying with us. When we were "kicked out" beucase they were closing, some girls approached and said to us all "yous guys rock, it was so much fun, I had the time of my life, thank you so much"... and on and on stuff like that... he he he... I liked it... there are several prictures from that night too. he he he.  After that we walked a lot on white avenue, then had some dinner, and at a point we just came back to sleep. The day after, when we woke up, it was at about 12, and it was a holiday... CANADA DAY!!!... a pretty fun day too. Daniel, Sandra and I spent the day together, and then at a point we joined the others and went downtown. Downtown Edmonton is very nice, it reminded me a little of chicago, just a smaller version of it. Anyway, we went by a bridge that had set up nice nice water fall, then there was music all over the place, people with Canada painted all over them, flags, stuff... There is some sort of court house with a huge fountain in front... well, tons of guys and girls were having fun IN the fountain... he he he. It was nice walking around there, and to see the Canadians get as crazy as they can get, yelling "HAPPY CANADA DAY" all over the place, and honking their cars. For a while we walked down white avenue again, and then at a point we came back to see the fire works. Those were, to me, honestly the best fireworks I've even seen... I just don't know how they make them do that... I just don't.  Hmm... what else?... after the fire works we went to have dinner with some guys to Boston Pizza (yummmy), and then to bed...  he he he.  On friday we woke up kind of early, and went downtown to pick up the car... after all we drove all the way to Calgary. The road was extremely nice, straight, and taken care of... thus it was terribly boring. It was so nice and well done, and so straight, that there is no way you won't fall asleep... I don't know how this guys stay awake... I guess that's why there are so many second cups and star bucks all over.  So we arrived to Calgary at a decent time, did some stuff, and head over to the circus... Calgary is an awesome city, much larger than Edmonton... I wonder why edmonton is the capital though... probably it was settled before... who knows. About the circus... what can I say?... nothing but magic... just like that... there were so many awesome numbers... I was of course breathless and in complete awe all the time.  Wow... a time of silence for that wonderful experience.  After the circus we went to Carlos' house, he lives with his girl Dee (who is a doctor), and they gave us housing during the weekend... we went to buy stuff for dinner, ate, had a pretty good talk, and pretty much feel asleep because the next day was going to be a tire some one!!!!...  And so it was, we went to Banff and Lake Louise!!!!... hmmm... I really can't say a lot about those places, is all about looking at them... maybe I should post pictures on this thing... Banff is a lovelly mountain town that has a great Arts centre... very very cool... it's like the "shangrilah" of arts... and lake louise wow... those views... hard to explain... What can I say though?... well, we walked a lot, had some good talks, but mostly, I was quiet and loving the views... thinking so much... I do that a lot don't I?.  When we came back to Calgary we just stayed in and have a nice time, watched a movie and what not... Sunday... what did we do?... Hmmm... yes!!... we had "brunch" in a Vietnamese place called Pho Kim (sounds like fuck him... he he he), and they had the bestest noodles... delicious... then we helped carlos and dee because they had a flat tire, and eventually we drove back to Edmonton. On the way back we talked a lot of course, trying to entertain Sandra and keep her awake. (she was driving).  Once we arrived, Daniel and I took the stuff to the apartment, and Sandra went to have dinner with her supervisor. Daniel and I had dinner in a very cool japanese place, and yet again, one of those great talks... it lasted till after 10pm, since after dinner we walked a lot around the avenue... When we came back we joined Sandra and watched some episodes from "dead like me"... then... went to bed...  He he he... this has sooo little detail!!!!... still, I don't have that much time... that's pretty much it though, so we will see...  CHEERS YOU ALL!... TAKE CARE!!...

      Love is a funny thing, one of those concepts and ideas that are hard to grasp, worthy of sonets and entire dramas, music has done it's share trying to portray it, as well as any other media in art... I guess it's art because love is anythign but mathematical, and cannot be really expressed in words... it's just a concept... and everyone portrays it as they have felt it in the guts.  Guts are fun... umpredictable... and sensible... guts hurt as much as they can be joyful...  Love is one of those "things" that can make you feel like floating, and then revolve in the ground as with the feeling that you get after a kick in the nuts... love is all this, and how is it that one single thing that cause such different emotions?... Entire wars have been fought in the name of love...   If love was a god, I bet it would be someone like Abraxas... he rejoices in chaos, and in anything that is far from stable... probably love was invented by him, and it's one of his tools to make this world still fun to watch sometimes. You know, one of those little devices placed in all our souls to entertain those "higher" guys...  Damn... that does sound like bastardizing such a nice feeling... because it is nice... but it's double edged, and the other side... oh man...  Anyway... there isn't really a point in me writting this... so I might as well stop... love is good, I want to love someone, be loved... even if it may hurt, and even if it's to amuze Abraxas... it's worth it...

      Now we are waiting for the  urlLink comicon ... we worked  urlLink VERY hard  this weekend, got everything ready... now let's see what happens... 72 hours almost non-stop is enough to turn everyone crazy, the good thing is that we already are... which makes things easier... still it was tiresome, but we loved it. Those are the moments that make me realize I could do that for the rest of my life, being part of a creative team, in a project bigger than my self, with a bunch of creative guys that share a vision, a passion, and the will to make things happen.  Right now I have a lot of "to-do's" and to be honest I don't know if I will make everything happen... one of the things is GAP, and well... that's getting tricky... this would be the last weekend, but as for now, I really don't know if I am going to be a part of it or not... I'd like to, just to close that circle, but I have so many other things, and right now, If I have to chose, I will certainly go for the kok stuff... that's my dream after all.  At the moment I am reading about videogame programming, comic book scripting, and playing NWN... and loving every minute of it... the idea of being able to devote a life to those areas is just way too appealing... as well I got an email from the supervisor at alberta saying that he is looking forward to my "candidacy"... which, for some reason, I think is a very good thing... he he he...   The table is served... I just have to settle things to be able to eat!!... yay!!... Six months, tops one year, I'll be living in edmonton... either working or studying... let's see what happens.  so... cheers... I gotta get more work done!.

      Picture a scene in your mind   Look at all the people and take note of the setting behind   Listen, watch, and wait   A plot beings to take shape   There's a story   And then characters will come to you   Relating events as they choose to   But all their words and actions come entirely from you   If you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility   And you can lead your characters anywhere you want   You have immunity      Have you considered the way   People might react to all the things that your characters say?   And are their actions hand in hand with what you want to portray?   Are you sick?   Arre you crippled? Insane?   Expressing the desires that daren't speak their name?   Are you the one to blamed?    Now you're a storyteller you might think you're without responsibility But in directions, actions and words Cause and effect You need consistency  How can you finish the tale? Lives which have played a part Are summarised from the very start And episodes left out to make it all go your way "It's a mighty big world Some of it I've seen But mostly I've only heard And stories are all fiction from their moment of birth"  You're just a storyteller You're not trying to escape responsibilty If we believe you then you're successful But you don't make claims of verity    by  urlLink Belle and Sebastian .

      And now a normal day again!!!...     Yesterday was almost terrible, just because I wasn't able to find the one comic that I wanted to buy as a "self gift"... and it sucks when you've been thinking all week about getting something and then, once you are about to grab it, it's not there. The guy from the store went looking for it, me, and some other dude, and it WASN'T IN THE STAND!!...  but for some magical reason my brother was able to summon it all of a sudden, and it was right there in front of my eyes... in a spot in whish I swear I looked for it!!!... why does that happens sometimes?. It's almost scary in a way.    Anyway, the day was nice, and at the end I did do something with some friends, and had good laughs with them all. Beers, good friends, and a good setting will always do that, I don't think I could ask for anything more on a bday. Though, there is deffinitelly a  lack of girls in my life , I have a couple of  female friends.  But because of what I do, and what not, I am pretty much either a loner, or just another freak among several other male freaks...  I have a blast with them, good laughs, good talks, and all that... but where are the girls?...     Some strategy is starting to be cooked on that matter...     **cheers.

      Bdays are funny, and I've never been a bday man... no, let me restate that, I have never been a "my bday" man, I love going to someone else's celebration, give a hug, and have a laugh, but when it comes to my self, well, I just see it as any other regular day.    There are people that MUST have some sort of celebration, other wise they will just feel devastated, me, on the other hand, I tend to be self conscious and in a  deep though  mood. Last year for example nothing really happened either, there was some good celebration but that was for graduation purposes.    It's deffinitelly not the fact that I am getting older, it's the fact that I am NOT getting younger and still have so much things do say and do in my life. A good mail that I received was from Jorge and it stated how the guys from "shooting stars comics" loved all out portfolio and they wanted us to do entirely a new comic. They don't pay as much as marvel, but we are getting there!. Yay!!...    Bdays for me are funny because I guess I live with the strong idea that every day is a "new day" and a "new game", and could well be the last. Some people wait till their bdays to realize that times is passing, me, on the other hand, live with that constant thought. I wonder that is better... if anything can be.    Will something  special  happen today?. I believe I'll give my self a gift, and then probably we will go hang out for a while in "the bananas" by chapalita... ok guys?. That could be fun... he he he.    ** Cheers to you all, and this day, cheers to my self too.

      We can be heeeeee-e-e-roes... for eee-ver and eee-ver....    One of the many silly things from my previous post made me wonder a lot of things. It's been about 7 months since I kind of closed the opportunity to a relationship in my life, mostly because I was (and still am), sure that I am going to move sometime soon away from this city... and I am one of those that tend to live a little too much in the future, or a little too much in the past. And because of all those things that happened, or could happen, I decided that, during the present, I didn't want to get into a relationship...     It wasn't really a subconscious decision, it's something that I knew... and that I just wanted to have fun while I was here... but still, it will probably be a year till I go and the odds are that some relationship will only last some months anyway... and I am closing my mind to that just because of something that may happen?....    I just don't get my self...     Still... I am so busy doing all this kinds of things!, I need a woman that is as crazy and busy as me... so that we could share sometimes, when possible, and those will be great, and those will be just fine...     But a lot of the times women seem to be time consuming machines, they just crave it and devour it, and when you don't feed them enough, they start "malfunctioning" and giving you all sorts of crap... hmmm... exageration?... maybe, but there is a spark of truth to that. They do want their space, but they do want you to be available whenever they feel like you should be available, no matter what.     Am I letting my previous experiences get in the way again?.    **cheers...

      It was obvious that blogger was about to release some sort of coments system soon, yet while that happened haloscan was a pretty neat choice... the thing that I don't like now, is that having the blogger system doing that now, I lost all the coments that were typed bia haloscan... now, I could have both things, but that'd be just messy... and unstylish... and we are all about style, right?.    Going into more interesting things, I got a very good mail from Alan about Abraxas and his ways, I do want to know more about him... and I am starting to develop a theory about this god of chaos. Hmmm... its not strong enough to write it down now though.    What I found amuzing today was an insight that was shared to me... how we always tend to live in a time which is not our own. We constantly go to our memories (living in the past), to search trough our experiences and see  what works and what doesn't,  so that we can apply them and this have a better outcome for the  future.  So, we keep looking to the past, a no longer existent time, to resolve a future that doesn't exists yet. And thus we forget that the only one time we have is the here and now. Is that what the buddhist unatachment is all about?, just not minding about anything but the present?.    So many questions...    And if any of you guys have a C++ book, a visual c++ book, if I could borrow it that would be awesome. I need to learn the stuff... I got a book about game programming, very good, yet once I started I saw that I needed more background, so I got this book about OpenGl and DirectX, yet once I started reading, I saw that I needed more on windows programming and visual c++, the MFC and stuff like that. The problem now is that I DO KNOW how to program, I just need to learn to move my self around this new paradigm, not wasting my time on reading about "for loops"... if you know what I mean.    Anyway... cheers. (what a messed up, inconsistent post this was... a reflection of the current status of my mind I believe).

      As for now, this site will no longer be known as  latide.  Thats the name of a project that never came to be, and there is no point in me clingling to it. "Queloco" is a much more descriptive adress for a site of mine, so now www.queloco.tk is the  good  one. Still, it latilde.tk works as usual.    On the other hand, I am trying to get aquainted with the new features of blogger, that, well, aren't that new to be honest, but I just didn't have the time up until now to play around with the new templates and options... this guys really are doing a good job with this stuff.

      A lot of weird stuff has been going on around the house for quite some time, not "nice" stuff to be honest, and every time it gets  creepier ... now we are all into reiki and the  "white light"  sort of thing, so we have felt protected and  over  darker stuff for quite a while, but this past couple of days... well... it's been too much.    It's known that hard reiki practicioners, or just people aligned with some "higher" level of understanding in dealing with energies and such, do get to experience  weird  things. Blanco, our friend, claims that in this house there are always weird noises and  beings.  It sounds almost unbelievable, yet it happens and it's very true. You learn to live with those, and to  expel  the ones that you definitelly don't want around.    Now, I don't want to freak people out, so that they don't come back to my house. But since this past week bad stuff has happened to us all in one way or the other, we have had terrible arguments between us, and the energy just doesn't feel right. Saturday night my parents say that, while hey were with another couple having a nice time in the living room, things started getting so bad that at a point they all light up all the candles around and started praying. You could feel it around, and worst of all, you could  hear  it too. Noises, things moving, a scared cat, and very scared visits. Now after that couple left, my mom and that tried to do some  cleaning  around the house. (as that cleaning is ought to happen). But they were so afraid that, to be honest, it didn't work.    Last night it happened again, now with victor and I in the house... it was scary!!. Really, it was... Kike was about to live the house, we all had a terrible argument, my dad was about to lose it, and I couldn't keep the calm attitude that I try to keep in every discussion. All of a sudden we all got goose bumps at the same time, (my vision got blurry too, which to me, has always being a sign... kind of a shift of planes sort of thing), noises were heard, and we could sense it.    Now my mom started freaking out, and my dad started saying how afraid he was.    THAT IS NOT THE WAY!.    Let me tell you, if you ever have to deal with something like that, YOU have to be the one in control, to be strong, and completelly sure that the precense is unwanted and you can just command it to go away. Just  be sure , those things feed on fear so to speak, fearing them is giving them the control. Now, don't get me wrong, I was trully scared, and that's why I think we didn't get rid of it just yet, still, Victor and I did quite good I think, and whatever it was we made it, at least, back off for a while... While I was in some other room doing some cleaning, victor said that he heard a guttural sound in the studio, which for some reason was the place that gave us all the worst vibes. (on the other hand, the room in which our cats sleeps was the cleanest one, cats do have something, and I almost bet we got this one to help us out with this one situation).    Anyway, right now the plan is to be protected, stay focus and grounded... and let's see what happens tonight. We might, as well, call upon our Reiki teacher, she's used to dealing with stuff like this all the time.    ** cheers

      They say every end marks a new begining, and so my "gap" process was over yesterday, but still, although the "official" thing is over, we have a long way to go as a team. The 3rd weekend was lovely, and I'll hold onto it dearly for all the years to come, it was filled with gifts, just a nice conclussion of quite a long process, a journey into my self so to speak... a journey into my self that actually led me to discover my self in others, and to understand the view of all other people as a reflection of my self.     The whole process was great, from the intro to the eip and then "gap"... as I was going through gap I didn't like it that much, because it's an exhausting process... but just as you cannot judge a movie until the end, I can now see why everything was the way it was, and how living that process will affect me for the rest of my life. It may sound cocky, yet it's true!.

      Yesterday I went to see  Stomp ...  ...  ...  ...  sorry, I've got no words... pure magic.  They made me remember something that neil gaiman says about the fact that his parents used to ask him to stop making things up, and that it's a good thing he didn't listen because now that pays his bills. The guys from Stomp could say the same, he he he he... I can listen to my own mom saying  hector stop making noise in the table ... it's a good thing some guys found out a way to make a living out of those  noises .  Yesterday was great... from breakfast in those tacos to going to bed reading a good tale... it was all good.

      There used to be a time in which I would claim that I am a  dog   person  and that's it... no cats please. That was motivated by several reasons: a) I am allergic to cats and b) dogs are much better pets... right?.  Now I am not so sure... I can see the good in each, but to be honest I am quite liking our cat a lot. Indeed, dogs are  better  in the sense that they do come when you call them, and stuff like that. But cats are there too, very independent, but with a lot of personality, they do take care of you, and love you. But they do it in a very undependant way. Besides I am doing some research on the topic and cats are rather magical creatures, extremelly bright, sometimes I even get the feeling that our cat is judging me through those eyes.  I like him, the way he walks, and the way he purrrs, the way he makes me feel, like he is in control and taking care of things around the house. It's an odd feeling, but I do get it...  On the other hand I forced my self to not be allergic anymore, and I was able to do it... he he he... which is amusing to be honest...  I used to like dogs more, but now I am not so sure. Dogs you can control, cats they are in control... they are cool. I like them.  ** cheers

      I realized something interesting a couple of days ago, it's something that I already knew somehow, but it really struck me as amazing... do you know why Japan is such a strong country nowadays?, why do they have such technology, culture and economy?.  Well, after WW2 they were torn appart, and they were FORCED to NOT do anything belic, so war stuff whatsoever, so, instead of doing military research and investment, they took all that money and time and built the Japan that we see today. See?, what you can accomplish devoting your energy to something other than war?. I find it funny when people say that all our technological advances have been because of war, so we should be thankful in a way...  thankful?!  I mean... it is a true statement, but damn, does that mean that we humans could not advance, or even go further, when motivated by something other than fear and hatred?. I  hope  that may happen someday.  (no pun intended).   That brings me to another topic,  faith . Is faith the strongest of forces?, the one that can accomplish everything?. Even above dreams, and imagination and hope?. I hate to be such a perfectionist, but I believe it comes down to a matter of deffinition. What is  urlLink faith ?. I'll have to admit though, that faith can be the strongest of them all, because after all, faith could be propelled by hope, dreams and imagination, and the strong belief that they will indeed happen no matter what. I think faith, if is was a function, would be in terms of imagination and will, or hope (the  good active hope ) and will, certainty and trust, strenght. So yes, faith is stronger... but it believe it is defined in terms of all the others.  By the way, wouldn't it be cool to have a female cat named  faith? ... or a daugther maybe?... he he he... could be a good name.

      Recently my  urlLink brother  posted something in his blog regarding  hope, imagination and dreams.   Hope was, according to me, the least important. The issue though is that it seems that both for memo and him, "Dream's" way to win the game by saying  I AM HOPE  was way too much, and of course there is no other way to view things, after all, what is the point of life without hope?... he he he...    Ok, I was a little bit sarcastic there, yet I want to state my point. Life as it is shows a lot of challenge for us, mostly because we tend to complicate things, and well, as  tools  we have several forces to aid us. Yet I believe that hope is one of the least important, hope is passive and a lot of the times leads to mediocricy.    But how?... hope is so important!!!... right?.    The problem now I believe pertains to language, since hope can be interpreted in several ways I believe. Hope is valuable as a  drive  tool, something to keep us going towards an end. Maybe ambition works too, or having just expectations out of life. And someone without  hope  or expectations is really an emty vessel taking up our air... I agree.    But still,  hope  leads a lot of the times to such a passice mediocre attitude!, "I  hope  things will get better... I  hope  this and that"... no, no, no. Why don't you stop  hoping  and start acting upon it?. Do you see my point?. It's like the difference between dreams and goals. We have such power, and our will can do wonders, yet a lot of the times  hoping  leads people to disassociate themselves from the problem and  wait for something  (rather external)  to happen, and make things right.     So probably I am not against hope... but against such use of the concept or deffinition. I am up for ambition and for having goals, and if we can fit that in  hope  then good, but the other connotations of the word are the ones I personally dislike. Please, not the word  personally.

       "That's your problem, Bruce. That's everybody's problem. You keep looking up." - God     I just saw  urlLink Bruce Almigthy,  now that is a good funny movie with quite a message... it could be the fact that I am all  damped  on the topic, or just that I am looking for signs all over the place that prove my theory right, (which sometimes happens, when you do want to see something, to start looking at it all over the place), but the fact is that this movie, is not only another Jim Carrey silly movie, it actually proposes something rather nice.     "People want me to do everything for them. What they don't realize is that they have the power. You want to see a miracle? Be the miracle".  - God, Bruce Almigthy... again.     It states the fact that miracles are in our hands, and they are up to us... and how the problem is that  we keep looking up  to have our lives fixed, waiting for a miracle, instead of getting our hands dirty and BECOME the miracle. Now we don't need Jim Carrey telling us that, a bunch of guys have done it all over history, with a casts that includes such guys as Jesus or Buddha, it's all within us, all that power to achieve change and do good. Why do we not believe it?... why don't I believe it?.    Anyway, it's a good laugh too...     ps.  "Behind every great man... is a woman rolling her eyes". Bruce - Bruce Almigthy         I just found this phrase hilarious.

      Well... it's not an anxiety attack as much as it is some weird  rather be doing something else  attack... quite weird actually, because no matter what I start doing, it feels like I should be doing something else... and although I feel bored, something inside of me is craving to do something... it beats me though, since nothing seems to satisfy that  something ... and just the fact that I have said  something  like a 100 times in this sentence already, is enough of a sign to prove my point... which is actually rather unknown to me... yet proven.... riiiiight.    It's one of those times in which, if I keep writting, I will rant a huge amount of nonsense that will, probably, amuse a few, but scare off and bore mostly everyone including my self. Somebody once told me it's a good excercice though, to just sit and write and let it all  flow out  despite the fact that it may not make sense. I guess I will open a blog to just do that, some mindflow sort of blog...     Yes... let's do that.    **cheers

      The other day I started thinking about coffee and how much I like it, for some reason I made a point of remembering all the places in which I have had good coffee, and the list is quite long and international... always a memory that isn't only formed of pictures, but of scents and tastes as well. Then I started thinking of toasted coffee beans, the great way they smell, and the nice taste it gives me to keep one around in my mouth for a while.    And then it struck me: I didn't know where coffee comes from!.    I mean, I know there is some plant... but are they really  bean-like  plants?, is it a bush?, a tree?, how does it look like?... Are the coffee beans the core of some fruit?, I mean... how come did I consider my self a coffee lover, and I didn't know any of this?!?!?!...    So, I did some research and coffee does come from some sort of bush, and the beans look like  urlLink this . Ok, that doesn't make me a huge  connoisseur on the matter, but it gives me enough info to be able to drink my coffee again and not feel guilty about the oblivion in which I used to live regarding this fine drink.    On the other hand, after all, this post has the word "magick" on it's title, so I might as well comment on that. It is not a secret that I am interested in magick and energies and such things, well, doing some research I bumped into a very interesting deffinition by a guy named Aleister Crowley. Now, we could talk for hours about this guy, what he did, and whether or not you should read his stuff... but we won't. What I have found though is that he manages some very cool concepts, and his deffinition is one that I like a lot:       Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will.

      This weekend was filled with movies and videos, which was very cool. I saw Shrek 2, Underworld, Lost in Translation, and several videos from the band  Lamb.  All those movies I loved, shrek 2 was hilarious, underworld was decent, and well... lost in translation... I believe I already have a huge post somewhere about that movie.    I wish I could see it over and over, to a point in which I know all the dialogs (that aren't that much). It's such a sweet movie, really, leaves me with the feeling of a sweet and tender kiss, but one that was too quick... the feeling of a laaaarge sigh... and with a small smile.     It was a good weekend, friday night I ended up in this "opium" bar which was actually fun (that was the name of the bar, there was no  opium  involved... I think), on saturday I got to have fun with the  urlLink kok's  , and saw the 1st copy of our printed stuff. It's bad that I say it, but I like it a lot!. he he he... sunday?... movies of course, and a pretty neat evening with Memo, Pollo and James... very interesting discussions, only obscured by the fact that I got a very bad stomach ache at some point, and it got the better of me for most of the time.     I like those talks, I like walking around a nice place and having a conversation with someone, or maybe just being quiet, but being "there". With this guys it's fun, most of the times is a  discussion based  conversation, in which you are hardly able to construct something with joint efforts, but then you are able to practice your logic and arguments.... and to laugh... it's always a good laugh.     What did I do once I got home?... of course!!... I finished reading the 3rd TPB of Promethea... wow...

      When I read something, and I get this feeling that I am terribly ignorant about the topic, and there is a huge universe behind every word, I feel excited, and I just want to learn more and more about it. That's what happening with  urlLink Promethea   every panel I read I want to learn more, and I get this idea that there is so much meaning behing all those words... and there is, of that I am sure.     There is one panel in which Hermes the tree times great looks right into your eyes - yes, the eyes of the comic book reader - and it's one of those "wow" moments in comics. Because of reading it I want to learn more about magic in general, about tarot and all those things. All the symbols that we have, etc. And yet again, I feel like life is too short to be able to do all that I want to during my life span. (which, as for now, is rather unknown to me).    I think the next issue of the TPB's will be out soon, or I may even go and get it on hardcover, I am just liking the series that much. Probably I am making too much of a deal because of it, but I am sure Alan Moore is giving us a lot of info in there, just waiting to be decripted by those willing and smart enough to do it. After all, as one of the characters say, "it's not rocket science".

      Most of the stuff that I've been getting on my email latelly is spam or something close to that...  my university keeps sending me this "job openings according to your profile" thing, it used to be amusing... I always get stuff like  accountant assistant, blah blah admin, production whatever, etc. .. now I just delete them right away... obviously they don't know my profile, if they knew, they would keep sending stuff related to make video games or a comic... why is it so hard?.  Still... my life since the begginig of the year has been quite messed up in terms of work and schedule, now I am officially working doing some stuff at the cite, which is quite cool actually, the work load is decent, it's a "people" enviroment (which is a huge change from the freelancing hermit), and gives me the time to work on my comics stuff... I still have that masters idea lingering in my mind, it would take me to Canada and teach me some new stuff... though I wonder, would that be just escaping?, or is that something I would do because I am afraid of not working things out in terms of comics?... for example.  Then again I think of those labs and Banff, and I know I would really enjoy that... two whole years devoted to some project of mine...  I want to write, I must write a comic story I have on my mind and work it out of my system... then I want to be social too... and get good at drawing, I need to do that for sure, even if I want to be an inker I have to be a kick ass penciler.... which I am not just yet. Of course work, and learn video games programming, and scripting to design a game and this have a demo... all this I want to do everyday... and to be honest, the time is not enough.  My multiple  likes  sometimes just confuse me way too much, sometimes I wish I could just be single minded and live my life doing whatever happily... or at least I wish I could keep things as a hobbie and focus on one thing at a time... then again, that seems like such a waste of time.  This body of mine though is starting to suffer my lifestyle, non sleeping and eating well is just not good...  and not only but, but having an ever changing schedule is even worse. Now I am starting to be up early everyday and have a  normal  day at the tec, and then arrive home, rest a couple of hours, and start with comics... slowly, but efficiently, my body is adjusting to this routine, and I am possitive than in a couple of weeks it will actually like it.  I want to make my web comic, put up my site... for how long will I keep  not doing  the stuff that I'd really like to do for my self?...  Argh... I am just in a weird mood.  **cheers... i guess

       How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.    The  urlLink eternal sunshine of the sportless mind   is a movie to see. I am really starting to see a pattern with this guys from FOCUS, and pretty much I am liking all their movies... they are deffinitelly not mainstream though, I could see that yesterday. Several persons walked out of the room, there were 3 girls next to me, and I could hear them comment  gosh I don't get it!... isn't this supposed to be funny?... let's get out...  and so they did. (another issue was that Jim Carrey acted on the movie, so a lot of people were expecting to laugh a lot... and well... it's just not that kind of movie. Although I like the way he handles drama too).  What is good about the movie?... the form and the content... talks a great deal about relationships and something that we all go through eventually when you are with someone... I think the movie can be enjoyed by everyone, but will trully give a lot of insight to someone who's been in a relationship, and out of it too. And the way the story is told, the photography, and all that  technical  stuff... it rocks. The acting is very very good...  Again, one of those movies that make you sigh a lot as you see it, and for quite a while once you've seen it.  My days have been rather cool, and yesterday I was told that deffinitelly I could work at the TEC taking Alex's place, which is tremendously great and will give me all the time I need to keep working on my art stuff, and regarding that... well... there are some pretty cool news. Last night when I got home after the movies, and dvd buying, and dinner... he he he, anyway, once I got there I called Eve and he had the best news ever... people from the US are calling us (by phone),  to start things up with them... comics wise... ahh!!!!... so f&amp;**îng cool!!!!.... anyway, more news on that once it's a deal, still, it's cool they are calling.  ** cheers!!

      I feel terribly tempted to make a post about  urlLink Fight Club , yet my brother was kind of enough to make fun of me... so, in a way, I feel like it doesn't make sense...  The thing though, is that the movie is quite good, and the last time I saw it was like... 4 years ago, so it was pretty much like watching it again, but with the knowledge about the  real  relationship between those guys, which, in my experience, makes you see the movie in a whole other way... so yes, it's a movie you've got to see at least twice.  Tyler Durder is like a  cool quotes  machine, and as crazy and messed up as the guy ends up being, his principles and ideas are quite interesting and good... you may question the means, but the end is rather noble I should say...  Check some of this quote for example:  Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives.   -- Tyler Durden       It's a very strong critique to the way we live now, or the way we  do not live...  in such a material world, a place were what we own  ends up owning us , following someone such as Tyler seems like the only logical thing to do... right?.  Anyway... as scared as I would be of the idea, (because I am a wuss when it comes to that), I think I'd like being part of some sort of fight club... not running around the city destroying things though, just he plain nice regular ass kicking would suffice.

      Yesterday I had a funny, yet frustrating, experience regarding my tasks as an inker in some current projects. It's always kind of hard to explain  urlLink what does an inter do   to someone that is completely unaware of the creative process of a comic... I was showing this guy the brochure that we were giving out at the  urlLink comicon  it has several samples of our work, several pages, and stuff like that... the  funny  part begun when he asked something like,  he: so... what is it that you did? me: I did the inking, it's done after the pencils and before the colors, I correct some stuff, and give a sense of dept and texture to the composition.  (I think I lost him here).   at this time he kept turning the pages around... and then again.  he: so... you didn't do anything here? me: well, I am the writer of one of the stories, and I do the inking... see here?, this is my work  (as I showed him a black a white page that has some of my inks). -now he was perplexed and confused... he couldn't make things work since those drawings weren't done by me, yet I was claiming that was my work.   After a long talk... and some trying from my part, we both gave up and at the end he just said  well, good luck to you!.   I think I should get used to this... right?

      There are  urlLink many deffinitions  about what a  black hole  is...   in a very rude way, we can say that those are objects of huge mass and energy, and that energy is not flowing out towards the universe, but inwards towards themselves... there is so much energy concentrated there that not only is their own energy absorved but also all the surrounding "astro-bodies" are pulled towards it. They are like a  negative sun ... in a way.  Anyway, this is not a treaty about phisics... the thing though is that there are sometimes people that are black holes themselves, but black holes of energy, of love, or passion. They have so much kept inside, so many things they have never being able to let out, to let go, to explore and explode, that at certain point in their life they become a black hole, and they start sucking all the energy around them and pulling it towards themselves.  Some people call them  energy vampires , and they may not know that they are doing it... but it happens a lot. It only takes one of those among a bunch of friends to turn the energy of the group upside down and make  bad vibes  flow around the room. And, on the other hand, those kind of people tend to, as I understand, develop cancer and other stuff like that, because they just cannot let things out.  I don't know why but as I was driving back from the bank I thought of this analogy... and I believe it works... it could be considered lame, but it makes the point. The  energy vampire  concept works, but I like the  black hole  idea because it talks about an excess of unreleased energy that causes that. And in most cases that's what happens, the person becomes a walking black hole because they don't deal with issues and don't let stuff out of themselves... without realizing that the light they need in their lives comes from within them, they start absorving it from everyone around... and at some point they can even make people feel uncomfortable without any real reason.  Now... what can we do?... if we bump into someone that makes us feel in such a way we realize they are a black hole, we could help them somehow by making them realize they need to let stuff out and find light within themselves... but mostly we should avoid becoming one, by living our lives and feelings in their fullest, and just allowing us to feel, to desire, to crave and love, and want, and hate, etc. To deny our feelings I believe is one of the worst things we could do.  To be honest this post is not making that much sense to me at the moment... but I believe it's a decent start for a better post later on, or just some idea to develop further... thus I will click "publish" so that it doesn't get lost. ( do coment please... maybe together we could develop a better idea ).

        Charlotte : I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.  Bob : You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.  - lost in translation      Sometimes I just feel plain confused, like some boat floating along the sea with no real direction... and that is scary... or actually, like a boat that is conscious of al the directions in may take, yet stalled because of it's indecision. Which I know, sucks...  I believe in magick, the power of will and how I am able to transform my circumstances in order to achieve whichever goal. Less that a year ago I decided that I wanted out of innox, and wanted to begin pursuing a life into a creative realm, I wanted to be part of that  fun  world of comics and games... Now, with the knowledge I've gained during this year, I do have an understanding of what comics are all about in terms or the artistic and the business process, and some good grasp of game development too... I love them both, and they are pretty much the  same world  to me... A world in which you work like crazy on something you feel passionate about, a fun world filled with art and creativity...  Yet they are so different in the way you approach them... which way to go?, what to do?... what should I pursue?...  Jorge is just back from the Con and he has great news, and inspiring words and experiences to keep us going... it seems that we made a decent impact with the guys in the comicon and now if we give good following to all that we can make things happen. But what about gaming then?. What about video-game designing and art?. I know I may sound like a spoiled confused little teenager that doesn't know what he wants to do with his life... I do know, I want to be a part of that world... work like crazy and do  something  creative... the problem is that whatever I try I love, and all those opportunities are challenging and great... they all seem like the coolest way to make a living...  But I do have to go for one... right?.  I know I do...  And just  picking bits and pieces  here and there seems like a waste of time sometimes... if I will end up writting and inking comics, maybe I should just devote all my time to become the best there... right?. But no, I take about 2 hours a day to learn about game development, and I find in terribly exciting too. Is there a way to make both things happen?, I think there is... to be honest I believe I could write and ink a comic monthly (just one though), and do gaming related stuff, no problem.  Once I make enough of a living in comics, or in gaming, I could devote the rest of the day to the  other  passion... and that would be great. The issue as for now is that I have to work about 8+ hours a day to make money... so that leaves me with just a few hours to make things happen regarding what I really want.  I guess that's why that quote from  lost in translation  impacted me so much... I wish I could see were will I end up in some years... just skip ahead all this... but it's exciting too, I love my karaokulta brothers and that is I project that I cherish and want to see evolve, and I want to be a part of it... study a masters then?. Who knows... of all, that is the one choice that isn't making that much sense to me at the moment. I love the idea of 2 years into a proyect of mine, going to banff and all though... so yes... I am a confused meat bag for the time being.  And I believe it shows... energy doesn't lie after all...  argh.... gotta go to the bank....  If I had all the money in the world, and that wouldn't be an issue, I guess I would love to work on a game, at least one or two during their whole development... and write comics too, having a couple of personal projects to draw or ink...  if and only if.

       The Wrong Girl  -belle and sebastian   I went looking for my darling, I went looking for a sign and I found her in the morning, somewhere in the back of my mind  I'm not what I could be, I need a true love I went looking and I found one  The wrong girl The wrong kind The wrong hand to be holding The wrong eyes to go searching behind The wrong dream to have on my mind   Yesterday was a neat day, we fixed some stuff around the house, and eventually went over Eve's house. There we saw a couple of movies while waiting for the crowd. I had some of the  bestest  laughs in a while, he he he he... the 3rd movie from Austin Powers is quite good if I may say so.  It was funny as well to listen to Estela's stories about Eve's sleeping  ways , and how freaky and spooky he can get sometimes... he he he... ( right eve? ) .   On the evening we went to Allan's department, there we were supposed to have some sort of orgy with tons of beautiful women, and things like that. At least that was the original plan ( fantasy? ). To be honest though, I didn't try that much to make that happen, and I guess that's why I am comfortable with taking the blame on the way things turned out at the end. Despite the fact that there were no girls whatsoever, I did have a good time... at least almost all of the time, I didn't enjoy that much the bit in which everybody was being bitter about no girls being there... he he he.  It's something that I have to fix... well, I don't have to, but I'd like to. I have a lot of friends, male friends. But where are the girls?. The girls I do get along with are so few... I'll have to start focusing my magick on that topic.  I am not a "do things" kind of guy, he he he... I am the idea guy, and the  make people excited  about it guy... but when it comes down to actually make things happen I have a long way to go. I guess that's one of the things that happened yesterday. I feel like I have a lot to say about it, but maybe in some other  deeper  post.  What I liked though is the way things turned out with Victor, that's pretty much what I wanted to be honest, for him to get drunk and release some of the stuff he is keeping inside because of his breakup with Ireri.  I shall not comment further on the matter, but it was good to see he was able to let a lot of things out. It's always hard to let go of someone that you loved, for a long time, and to realize that all of a sudden all those  forever love  promised where just... nothing.  On the karaokulta side of my world things are looking bright, the travel to the comicon seems to have been indeed very powerful for us as a comic studio. We will see how that goes.   Sometimes I am so confused...
