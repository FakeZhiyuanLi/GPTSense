       Awhile ago Katie and I promised to get our ears pierced together. I'd be getting my second piercing, while Katie would be getting her first. Well this Tuesday she walks into the classroom with her ears pierced! She broke her promise!  Then the stables called and said I couldn't work until my back was better. So, another thing wrong.

       I got to see Fire Lily today. Yay!!! She's out at Kittyhawk Kigers and she's in heat. She was teasing the stud, Hombre, so they had to move her to a different pasture. Anyway, she's fat. Well, not fat, she's actually in really good shape. She's out with two geldings who she gets to boss around. She loves it out there, which is good. She always hated being in a stall.  Oh yeah, my mom called on of the people at the stables a bad name yesterday. She never fails to make my life worse.

       Went in to feed Taffy today before school and there was only 1 flake of hay left! There should have been 2 flakes! Somebody stole some. I already asked 2 of the people who keep their horses there if they fed Taffy or borrowed some hay or something. No, they hadn't. I know for a fact they didn't. That only leaves one person. Deanna.  I hate to say that, cause she's my friend and all, but I think it's true. I really hope it isn't.  Another friend problem: Katie.  Yes, her name's the same as mine. Anyways, at the beginning of the year a new girl moved into town from Alaska. Her name's Heather. The three of us were all friends, but then I went to Arizona last February for a week and when I came back things were much different. Things had been changing before I left, but the changes had gotten worse. First, Katie went to the Valentine's Day Dance. She would never go to a dance, no matter how much I begged her, but Heather talked her into it. Second, she no longer ate lunch with Natalie and I, she ate with Heather's friends. I tried to eat with them for two or three days, but it was obvious that I was one person too many. Then Prom came. I was gonna go, but nobody seems to want to ask me out, so I didn't go. Katie went, though. Afterwards, she got drunk, stripped in front of 4 guys, and possibly had sex with one of them.   I have opinions on everything. Katie knows that, she also knows I don't like what she did. I know she's ashamed or embarrassed about what she did. I know because of the way she looks at me when Heather or somebody starts talking about their little "after prom party". It really pisses me off. Excuse my language. She needs to get her life figured out or she's gonna end up like her mom; pregnant in high school, low paying job, etc. I want our friendship to end. I don't want to watch her ruining her life anymore. I don't want to be the one who fixes everything and makes it better. Oh wait, she has Heather to do that, at least in the dating area. All Katie needs me for is to do her homework, which I refuse to help her with. You know, I'm tired of being her shadow. I'm tired of people asking who I am, and when I say "Katie.", they respond with "Katie Rose?". Guys seem to think she's beautiful, and she really is. As far as I know nobody thinks of me as beautiful. I've always been kinda pretty or just cute. Man, I sound like I'm jealous. I guess I am. My life seems to be crumbling. It's like a mid-life crises at 16.  Oh well. Such is life!

       Ouch! I've been achy all day. Hope I'm not getting the flu or something. I'm always getting sick it seems.  Mrs. Robbins gave me back my paper. I got 95%! Yay! Then she dropped another paper on us, The Great Gatsby Final.... Hmm, what should I write on? The signifigance of the green light? Gatsby's desire to relive his past? So many choices!  I also have Health and Economics homework.   Well, I'm trying to decide whether or not today was good. Gosh, I woke up to early, my cat threw-up, I couldn't find anything decent to wear, and the list goes on and on.   It seems like all I do is complain. Which is wierd because I don't complain very much, usually. Or at least I think I don't.   Oh, my parent's just got home. Got to go feed Taffy!

       I missed school today. Well, I didn't really miss it, but I sure wasn't there! Actually, I just kinda woke up and it was 10 and I was all alone, so I just hung out at home all day. Yay!   Last night I only got one thing done. Big surprise. Yah, I just cleaned stalls. Instead of bringing Taffy over to work with her, I brushed out Ben's mane. It took me an hour! He had some major dredlocks going! So now his mane's all nice and pretty and long! It's like over 2 feet! He's so gorgeous, he looks like an Andalusian, but he's pure Arabian.   Tomorrow I'm going to school. Then I'm coming home. Then I'm going to bed. Wow, big day tomorrow, huh?!  I do hope that Mrs. Robbins (my English teacher) gives back the paper she collected on Thursday. She made most of the class redo their papers because she didn't think that they were "A" material. I had to redo mine, although I thought it was wonderful and so did various other people. Oh well, the one I just did should knock her socks off. Yes, it was that good. I happen to be wonderful at BSing.

       Well, my first post! Yippee!    Anyways, I have so much stuff to do! Let's see here...  1.) Clean stalls and sweep an aisle at the stables. Oh joy! 2.) Worm Taffy. 3.) Take Taffy over to the stables and work on jumping.  4.) Do some Latin. Damno Latine! 5.) See if I can talk somebody into taking me to see Fire Lily!    Well it doesn't seem like much, but it really is. I mean I'll be working at the stables for like 3 1/2 hours! Then I have to walk over to the self-care building and worm Taffy. Then I need to walk her back to the main barn, groom her, and set up some cavelleti, and so on, and so forth. Then I need to submit my Chapter 8 Latin Exercises, which take forever to type out. By the time I'm done I won't have time to see Fire Lily.  *Sigh*  I really, really need to work with Taffy. I have to get her into shape. Right now she's, um... "pleasantly plump". I want to enter her in the Emerald Valley Something Or Other Miniature Horse Show which is on the 29th-31st. So I have a lot of work ahead of me.  Which reminds me of my job this summer. Construction! I'm gonna be helping to build the new self-care barn. As soon as I make $700, I'm buying a cart and harness for Taffy. Maybe I'll buy a new saddle for Fire Lily? Oh, and a 4 1/2" low port curb while I'm at it. Hmm, the Canby Tack Sale is coming up soon.............  I better go get ready for a day full of stall cleaning. :(
