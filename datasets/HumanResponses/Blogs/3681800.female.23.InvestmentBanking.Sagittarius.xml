       Ponder this:  Graduation music fills the air on a sunny day.  Proud students wearing graduation gowns prance daintily across a damp field to get to their assigned seats--while one graduate holds up the line because a parent wants a picture.  Speeches about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ensue. Excitement and boredom fill the graduates--excitement for finishing, and boredom from trite speeches (especially from those deemed to be better by mathematical calculation).  Proud parents cheer their child as he or she makes his or her way to the stage to accept the well earned "diploma" (which is not more than a piece of laser quality paper until they mail the real one to you in a few weeks).  Caps tossed in the air, while students scream to their best ability. Closing "arguments" proceed, and then: Graduation music lives on once again, this time to accompany the exit.  More flash photography. etc...etc.  This whole process, when graphically depicted, will look like a bell curve.  For those who don't recall what that is, it's what probably saved you from flunking Academia 101.   Congratulations! So now what?  So my dear proud post graduate, what now?  Have you got a job, er,  career  lined up?  You do? Good!  That's a hefty 20% or so of you that have the same answer.  A portion, let's say 30%, will go on to more schooling for the fear of the unknown or in the rarest case--they knew what they wanted from the get go, or uh, their parents knew what they wanted for them from the get go.  Rock on you future doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, etc!  The remainder are those that had no plans, and are now looking for jobs.  For the latter, the real question is--did you get what you want from your undergraduate college career?    I got the education I needed, but not the practical knowledge I craved--learning to interact with people.  That's just something that can't be taught because the competition for grades in schools is what causes people to become loners; the idea is that when you help someone out, that person will potentially crush you when it comes grading time. I wish my school taught People Skills 101.  An example: Theories and numerical plugging and chugging do nothing for you in terms of likeability, and shows employers NOTHING about how well you'll interact with the team.  Most of my classmates were super brainiacs who hated interacting with their fellow students and would prefer to work alone. I always thought I was the odd one out, until I set foot in the real world.  After having gone thru a set of interviews, I began to notice a trend among employers.  Ask them the question, "what were the best and worst qualities of the person who held this position in the past or of those that they have interviewed and not accepted in the past", and you'll get some interesting remarks.  First of all, that question tends to stand out of the norm, and also, that question aids you in your future interviews as to what these people look for.  The worst they can do is not answer you (or not hire you)--still a learning experience.  Anyway, i've heard countless complaints about people not being a team player, or that they were too "quiet", or too "shy", or not "personable".  In the end it's all common sense--we all want to work with someone pleasant.  In fact, companies already like you on paper, why else would they offer an interview?  The interview is merely a way for them to distinguish weirdos from ultra-cool people.
