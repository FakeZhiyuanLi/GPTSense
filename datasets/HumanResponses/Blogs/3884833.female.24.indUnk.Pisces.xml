      This blog has been created as an outlet to my domestic frustrations.  Not generally a negative person, I have been drawn to blogging as a healthy outlet to my life.  If I seem bitter, I'm generally not, but some people just know how to get under my skin.  So after 7 months of putting up with a roommate from hell, I'm getting payback.  This is my blog to chronicle just how much of an a** one man can be.  Meet my roommate Wanker Boy (aka WB).  33 years old.  No job.  2 kids he can't support.  He can't hold a job and sits on the couch smoking 420 and watching television all day long.  His car barely runs, registration is far overdue, no insurance.  I'm actually surprised he has a legitimate license.  He's living with my other roommate Angel Girl (aka AG) who is just that, a wonderful person.  He's so insecure she's going to leave him I don't think she's spent more than 1/2 a day away from him in 6 months.  Frankly, I wouldn't blame her.  She's disabled yet working because he doesn't and they wouldn't have enough money to survive otherwise.  Also living with us is his 3 year old son, occasionally his stepson from a previous relationship, and my daughter.  AG and myself keep the house clean, make dinner, and see after the kids.  WB sits on the couch, watches TV, yells at the kids, messes around on the computer, and occasionally cleans to floors.  This blog is going to include lots of past IM's and emails just so people can get an idea of who this man really is.

       My response:    Don't believe everything you hear or read on the news.... this has been on the web for a while and is just a way for spammers to get your email address.  Take care, Jen   His response to me:   i know this is the thrid time i have sent it out so dont assume I have know idea what this is or that I belive everything I read OK!!!!!! Im still waiting for my check which I know is not coming so fuck it I like to send shit like this out & again DO NOT ACT LIKE IM DUMB OK!!!!! later WB   My response back:   WHOA!!!   Didn't mean to offend, just wanted to let you know.     I've gotten it before and thought it was real.     As for you and some check, I don't know what you're talking about or why it means anything to me, but if life isn't going well at the moment I'm sorry to hear it.   I don't think, nor was I trying to imply that you are DUMB.     Take care, Jen   His final response, can we all say bipolar?   the check would be from bill gates. it does state that in there & yes the way you stated it to me was like this, dont belive everything you read or see on the news Hum sounds like your talking to a kid & not me. So thats what offended me the way you stated it.  Ok anyway enough of that how is everyone doin get back?  Bye for now  WB

      Today... it was that I suggested going to Trader Joe's as opposed to just giving him food money because he likes to shop at Safeway.   Last weekend.. it was the fact that he is borderline abusive towards his kids, yells all the time, and I just can't stand much more. I had an anxiety attack Sunday because of it. I can't stand yelling. My mother yelled at me all the time when I lived with her. SHE was verbally abusive.   The rest of the time... it's hit or miss as to whether he's going to be in a good mood. If he is, and more often than not he isn't, then things are fine. We can all hang out, and life is good. If he isn't.. forget it.. he's rude and grumpy and leaves the rest of the house walking on egg shells. I'm tired of it. I feel like if I stay there much longer, I'm going to really grow to hate him and I don't want that. He's been a friend of L's for a long time and I don't see him suddenly exiting my life anytime soon. Not that I have to be close friends with him, but I'd like to be able to tolerate him and right now that's getting more difficult. He's incredibly controlling towards his girlfriend (not my problem, but I feel sorry for her) and I guess I'm just at my wits end.   Sorry.. this is really frustrating me.

      Good is definitely not great.  Being home causes me angst and anxiety.  But for the most part recently all interactions with WB and AG have been good.  Today however, as they are feeling the crunch from WB not working  I  get IM'd about money.  You know what, when you make a contribution to the household.. come bitch at me.  Until then, shut up!  Here's the IM:   WB  (1:52:25 PM): just wondering if you were going to be helping out w/food or not  Me  (1:52:48 PM): I don't get paid again till next week  Me (1:52:52 PM): and then.. yes  WB  (1:53:08 PM): & AG said somethiong about helping out w/the PG&e  Me  (1:53:18 PM): Yeah, I was going to cover this month  Me  (1:53:25 PM): she said it was only about $50  WB  (1:53:36 PM): so  Me  (1:54:17 PM): so........  WB  (1:54:44 PM): oh & why do i owe the gas station for papers?  WB  (1:55:07 PM): you aske dme at that time if i needed anything & use said you would get the papers  Me  (1:55:44 PM): OH! because the other day when I went up to get them I didn't have enough money.. I came back, but ran into AG half way and she had the papers.. I thought she had bought them, and then found out yesterday that she hadn't.. I told D that one of the three of us would get the money to him  Me  (1:55:57 PM): it was a mixup.. that's all
