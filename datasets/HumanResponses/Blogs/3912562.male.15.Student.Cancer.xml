      My Buddy, Best Friend, (hopefully my best man), Dan Barber.  Dan was born on May 2, 1989 in Red Bank  I first met him in Lanes Mill School in 2nd grade. We later became better friends in 4th grade and pretty much became good friends in 5th grade. Six years after 5th grade were still friends.  He moved out of Brick into Howell during the summer after 5th grade. He started the drums in 6th grade and in my opinion is very good at it now.  Dan met Chris, Lou, and Ian in Howell and they formed a band called LMS (Last Men Standing). I created the site,  www.thelastmenstanding.tk  who knows if it even exsists anymore.  Dan loves music. I on the other hand couldn't care less if it ever exsisted. But he has got me into it nonetheless. hehe   I still dont understand him fully, but maybe in the near future we'll start asking and talking more about eachother so we can fully understand one another. I figured out Dan is a very smart dude in areas of interest, and he is starting to realize that it's not all about getting laid. He's probably the only friend I know that actually uses their head and thinks once and a while. People at this age get bored easily and quickly turn on the radio so they have something to do. Not once in their life will they use their brain. This falls towards girls especially. I only wish the girl I marry in the future wont be as annoying or stupid as most girls ive met.  Woops! Kinda strayed from talking about dan. I'm going to gradually compile this post until I die. In memory of my friend Dan...   (although he's hopefully not dead, since I made this whole thing to show him before !I! Die...)  -Paul

      The day I was born. The day when I start this journal. The day that I'm either dead or never going to see you again. :(  July 12, 1989, 15 years later after this date I recieved a Foozeball table and $30 from my Aunt and Uncle. It's now 1:19  in the morning on the next day. Dan just IM'd me, he typed...  Crazydrumer1: lol i was talking to her while she was blazing (getting high) and she started to talk like nonsence it was halarious id be like i like bob marley n she was like o shit me too i have his cd in my car ill pick u up n we can drive around n listen to him  Were talking about this girl he works with at Berry Fresh Farms. She's 19 and he thinks he might get some with her. I highly dought it since she's way to old for him and she would probably never do anything with him. She's just having fun with a younger dude :)  Crazydrumer1: shes cool as hell tho i just wish she can stop she know its bad for her but she cant stop shes addicted to it n she gets such a bad crave at night that if she cant fight it shed die i vfeel bad for her cuz shes hot n cool and hot but shes a pot head lol   Another thing, she smokes. Not good for her or Dan so that's another reason he shouldn't get involved. Oh well, whatever, It's his life. I just hope he doesn't die or do anything stupid.   Oh yeah! I still havent introduced my Best Friend Dan to you. Well, me and dan go way back till around 4th grade when we had the same teacher, Mrs. Delanoy. She was a pretty mean lady in general, at least in my perspective at the time as an 8 year old. Who knows. Maybe she was nice after all. Just that I couldn't handle her being 8 and all.   I remember cutting my leg one time when I kind of skippped school for the day. I had to come in with crutches since my leg was stitched up. She asked me what had happend and I told her that I was playing kickball with my sister the day before. Then she got upset and yelled at me since that was the day I called in sick. Being honest and ignorant at the time sucked.  I guess we all go throught that. Anyways, this is random but it popped into my head. I need to find a girl-friend. Either one really. Not a snobby little "blonde" that thinks they rule over you, but a nice intelligent girl that doesn't have to be the hottest chick in the block. I dont know why really. I guess I just feel the need to get in a relationship.   The opposite sex is so different! You never would have thought... Even after all the times and experience with them, you just never understand anything. But I think I understand one thing for sure, they are about the love, not the 8---D :) I plan on getting married one day to that one woman they always talk about. Thing is, I'm growing pretty damn impatient. Well, cant wait! :)    Anyways, Im Paul Sproge, I just turned 15, and I'm going to sleep or something. Talk to you tomorrow who ever is reading this. BTW, me and Dan hopefully hang out.  -Paul  P.S.(initials, hehe) Hobbies,  Computers, Games, Movies, People, Thinking, Creating, Flying, Aces High, Chatting, Photography, EVERYTHING! Life itself is a hobby. And it's a great one! I cant stand people who hate life and are always down. I mean sometimes im like that, not all the time  though. I'm also very patient, I can hold my anger if I want to. I can release my stress very easily and I'm quick to forgive. :) Hopefully, if at all, those few things stay like that for the rest of my life.
