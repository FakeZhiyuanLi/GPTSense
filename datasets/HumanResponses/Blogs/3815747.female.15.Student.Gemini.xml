       ahhhh i'm so tired... and they changed the blog updater. it's much cooler now, with varities on size an all...    &nbsp;  but back to the tired thing. i think i'm on a sugar crash, because i had this energy drink before and i was extremely hyper for a little while. that's the trouble with me and sugar... we don't mix very well.&nbsp;i become extremely hyperactive for a short period, then just... crash.    &nbsp;  so i posted that i was tired on the boards... and this person with the screen name teh Havoc 'insulted' me for not using the shift key. and i put insulted in quotes because it wasn't really an insult... just a comment that was a tad bit rude. but i don't care; hardly anything gets me  pissed  anymore, just angry. which are two entirely different levels of mad.    &nbsp;  so dots tried to help me out by telling him that i was tired... so thanks, dots, if you're reading this.    &nbsp;  umm... not much else to say, except my cat is making me mad. every morning she meows until i put my arm over the side of the bed so she can busy herself by rubbing it... OH CRAP SHE JUST JUMPED ON MY DESK! hold on.    &nbsp;  ok now that that's over, i meant to say that now she paws at my door and makes it slam against the frame a gazillion times until i get up and let her out and feed her. grr.    &nbsp;  love ya all, except for those that piss me off.    &nbsp;  -faithy poo

      This is the same thing I posted over at LiveJournal, but I figured I'd post it here, too.  I was in a really bad mood yesterday evening, which usually means I'm prone to arguing and/or debating, so one of my friends from a message board suggested we debate the topic of abortion. He hasn't responded yet, since I only just started the debate this morning, but here is what I've said on the subject:  "I'm slightly torn on the abortion topic. It really depends on the case, in my opinion. If you're an adult, have a stable job, and were just extremely moronic and went and had sex without protection, then you should have the child and deal with it. If you have to, put it up for adoption, but you shouldn't destroy a human life just because you were a moron.  "If a teenager was moronic and had sex without protection, then they deserve to have the child, too. Again, put it up for adoption if you can't handle it, but have the freaking child.  "The last scenario is the one I'm torn on. What if a girl is raped, and becomes pregnant? That's not exactly her fault, so she shouldn't have to birth a child she can't afford. Then again, I'm still against the taking of a to-be-child's life. My two views are: if you absolutely can't afford the child, then do the abortion. If you are able to afford it, have the kid, and then maybe put it up for adoption."  If anybody would like to submit their own views and opinions about abortion, please feel free to do so.

      Yep, I was grounded. Not today, and not yesterday, but the day before: Tuesday, June 29, 2004. It was the first time I'd ever been grounded, can you believe it?  Yeah yeah, you might be thinking I'm a goody-two-shoes, since that's the first time I've been grounded. I'm not, really, since I've been doing the thing that got me in trouble for a long time now - I've just never been caught.  It wasn't so bad, actually. I wasn't grounded fully - just in the sense that I couldn't use the internet, which was what got me in trouble in the first place. Not that I had anywhere to go, anyways.  I've got an girls' open gym for basketball today, but I don't want to go. First of all, out of a team of about 14, only five girls have shown up each day (including me), so we've had to play with the coaches. And yesterday, I was wearing sandles (I didn't feel like putting on my bball shoes just yet) and my brother started playing around with me, pretending to punch and kick me. He accidentally hit the tip of my toenail with his shoe, and ripped part of it off.  I went to basketball anyways, since my toe only stung a little bit. At first, it hurt like hell, but then it softened down to a little throbbing and a stinging like when you touch a cut with your finger and it's dirty. That kind of sting.  But then, when I was going up to rebound a ball, my coach jumped up to grab it from me, stomping on my toe and knocking me over in the process. I was okay for a bit, but then my toe started really throbbing and it was painful, so I sat out. I got back in the game, though, only to have my nose elbowed so it hurt a bit.  And  then , to make matters worse, my knee started hurting like crap so I couldn't run very well. I was hobbling >.  Anyways, back on my original point - I don't want to go to the open gym because of my toe. It's really sore now, and I don't think I can deal with another person stomping on my toe. Plus I'm not into the whole impacted knee thing.  I wouldn't be so whiny about my toe, but that was my  good  toe. My other one had an ingrown toenail that keeps coming and going - right now it's gone, but if somebody lands on it it'll start to bleed and be there again.  So basically, I have a sucky body.

      Yep. I just started this Blogger. I really wanted a Livejournal account, but you need a code from a friend to get a free account if you don't want to pay. But I have no friends using it, so yano.  If you have any questions or comments for me, please feel free to use the 'post a comment' link under my blogs.  An entry is coming soon.
