      remember me? we used to be good friends, you actually thought for yourself then, now you love one of my best friends, and molded youself into what you think that she wants. well listen up, whats the point in being something your not just to impress a girl? WHO are you? because your not the person i used to know. you used to want to hang out, we liked the same bands, and over all we had a lot in commen, but ever sense you started liking this girl we dont have anything in commen, you try to prove me wrong and we havent hung out just by ourselves sense... god only knows. ive had it. youreally hurt my feelings now, and the last time we hung out it hink you spoke about 3 sentences to me directly and thats because i asked you a question. Its to bad things had to be this way. your life is going to get pretty shitty pretty fast if you keep this up. BE YOURSELF not what you think others will like, and what others want you to be. im always here for you. its to bad your not there for me. if you ever figure it out im ready to be your friend again

      alright so as the days progress in my summer, this past thursday ash got her nose pierced and i had to get mine on friday, so now we are piercing sisters... i guess hahaha, yeah i really like it, its cute. i dont really have anything new to talk about. i just wish i was in canada right now, its the first summer that i am not going to be able to go. my dad and my brother both went, i just want to see all my friends that i only got to see for 2 months out of the year and now i dont get to see any of them its really sad... but its okay i guess. its&nbsp; a part of life. i am going to hawaii but i kind of wish i could just go to canada instead sometimes, its my comfert place you know. i always went there every summer and when i came back i was a lot stronger than before mentally, spiritually, physically and even socially sometimes. but i guess there comes a time where my summer vacations come to an end... 17 years was pretty good. this one has been good... not as good as some others, but its been okay. i usually have a little bit of a fling, but that dosent happen in washington haha. there are a few select guys who i would consider, but they are all either moving, taken... or i dunno something. it dosent reallty matter though, to much work. anywho until next time

      sometimes i wonder why i even try, im sitting here all by myself thinking about someone who i had... but is gone now. every person i try to impress dosent impress me, they just dont compare. Why do i get up every morning and put my makeup on, and do my hair, what is it for? no one. no one here is what i like, or maybe its becasue my perception has been altered so much into what i want i cant even look at a guy with out pointing otu his bad qualities. everytime i try to explain this to one of my friends they either dont get it, or they jsut dont care that much, usually i dont even care that much. its just times like these when im sitting all by myslef next to the internet that can take me all over the world but its still lonely. what the hell am i talking about? im jsut babbling on, but i guess it makes me feel better. i want to get out of here and see that person one more time... closure, thats the key, but like a lot of things in my life things are left unsaid and everyone, especially me are either to proud, or scared to say what they really feel. im sick of giving other people advice and helping them get there lifes, especially love lifes together and mine is just... non existant at this point. i think i just need to bitcha little bit. i think every guy that i have ever dated, or has at least liked me back has taken some piece of my heart, saying that i miss every single one of them sometimes, well except one.. haha stupid idiot, but i can even laugh about it, i got used and i dont care anymore, its funny now. all i know is that there is someone and a life out there for me, i just hope it gets here or i get there soon.

      ok so i think its the 14th, im really tired, and im really bitchy today i feel bad for my friends because i was being really mean but i think they got a good laugh out of it, because my mood swings are kind of funny, not really funny but kind of. i had a pretty fun day. amber and drew are back together despite the drama, thats good though even though i told amber not to, i love drew, and i think everything willb e okay this time... hopefully. So when amber was telling me about her and drew and how she was feeling about it, it just really reminded me of shane and how it feels to have your heart ripped out... haha not really but it sucks, and i miss him so much, he made me laugh all the time, and was the best for cuddling, but i dont miss somethings, it was fun while it lasted, but its soooo overdone, i cant wait to meet someone new. seriously. anyway, tomorw i babysit, then friday its family dinner with ambers fam, then that night im hanging with bill and abs, then sat im going to see trina and erika so im excited for all of the above, and i have a job lined up for me... and i get a lot of money. well im going off to chill for the rest of the night and maybe work on a song im writing. peace

      Here is my question to everyone why is it when you are in a relationship even the most rational person who always keeos there cool and looks at everyones perspective, so basically a very logical person looses it. i swear to god everyone turns psycho, including myself. seriously what the hell. even the most simple of situations can be turned into  a comlicated mess. i know everyone has had to deal with it, its called emotions... aka emo.
     ok so, a lot has happened in the past two days. my friend ashley is moving to ellensburg to escape her mom, drew and i were making a pillow for ambers mom... haha i know its rediculous, but then drew brakes up with amber that same night. what the hell? they were just fine, drew didnt say they were having problems, in fact he said he couldnt of been more happier, then he brakes up with the girl, so i got a call at 1 in the morning of amber crying and i was like jesus, what is this all about. so know i got some drama to deal with but thats okay. i also had my mmeeting for my job today wich will start in august. Any who im just hanging out at my house because my mom came home today leaving me home for a week... haha. ill write soon.

      Odviously i have decided to start my very own blog, its cute i know. im not quite sure why i wanted to start this but i think i kind of just want to bitch about my life a little bit. SO ill give you a little backround information, My name is Renee and i just graduated highschool. i quit my job as a bagger at a grocery store because i wanted to be a lazy ass this summer, but dont worry i have another one lined up for september, im taking a year off before i go to college, and despite everyeon telling me im not going to go back i know i am. i want to be a photographer. I live in washington state and i was and still am in love with a guy, we will call him shane for kicks. Basically it was a long distance thing and it was going on for 2 years, we decided it was rediculous to keep it up so we broke it off and now we are just friends. it was kind of cheesy, we planned on moving to the beach in california and playhing our guitars on the beach being bums and getting a dalmation, haha sounds absolutly disgusting eh? yeah well whatever, its done now, i just have to get over it first. Any way im going to keep writing as the days go bye and if anyone wants to give advice, comment, or even criticize be my guest, id love to read the feed back.
