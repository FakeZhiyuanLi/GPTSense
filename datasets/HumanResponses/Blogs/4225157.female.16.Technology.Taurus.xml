          Today I worked on packing, and I helped with laundry. I also worked on butesa.org. I worked on the projects page. It was kinda cloudy today.....but the high was 90. Aubrey and I set up the large 5 man tent tonight to see if we had everything to put it up for camp. He and Ryan are going to use it. Kelsey and I are going to use their tent. We decided to sleep in it tonight so we don't get bothered with the mosquitoes! They get in the house and bug you all night long! Anyway I hope we sleep good out there. Yesterday we had a thunder and lightening storm, it started to fires on the black hills. They are out now.                   We want to get out of here by 6:00 am Tuesday morning.  I hope we do ;) I want to get there early :D I probably won't get to type in here till I get back unless I get to use Kelsey's Lap-top ;) We also worked on the dog's kennel and the rabbit hutch. Fixed the doors on both. I let Kendra out for a while, boy is she getting big! :D She will be really big when I get back!           Well I'll try to type again before I leave, but we shall see.....ya never know what will happen! Good night all! Type at you later!          Kelsey j

        Today was busy as normal. I worked on getting the email accounts set up for the site. Finaly got them figured out! Then I changed all the addresses on the site where we had put them. Then I "put" all four pages up. Then we all worked on the cleaning. The Booth's arived safely at The Sims' house, and the Cliffords did too. We are going to just stay home tomorrow. Sunday we are going to fix the dog's kennel gate so it works again. After Trevor broke it a few months ago. I packed most my clothes for camp this afternoon.  I didn't want to be packing at the last min, and then forget something! Wow, camp is getting close! Only two days till we drive down!  Chantel will be there about the time we get there I think.....I can't wait to meet everybody! I finished the talk for camp a few min ago. I hope that goes smoothly!
