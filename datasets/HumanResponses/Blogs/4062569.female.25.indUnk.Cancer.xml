         April 22, 2004 At a Houston “Earth Day” rally, John Kerry told his supporters that he truly dislikes gas-guzzling SUVs because they are poor for the environment. Because of this, he once proposed a 50-cent gas tax increase. Kerry said that he supports increasing fuel economy standards to 36 miles per gallon by 2015 in order to reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil. He also said that he has talked to Ford about making a hybrid car his new “campaign car.”           Meanwhile Kerry Flies around in his private jet campaigning across the country that probably takes on about 5,000 gallons of fuel to get from one side of the country to the other...yea real freaking great for the environment..dumbass and your stupid hybrid car...why dont you travel the air in a hybrid plane or something...oh wait those dont exist...fucker...I hate when people make statements like that and they have like 5 private jets...private jets are the biggest gas guzzlers of all...especially when you fly in them 10 times a week....GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

        Am I unpatriotic because I didn't watch Kerry's speech last night??? I mean maybe I should have.  I don't know I guess I just had other priorities.  I decided that going shopping and buying skirts would be more fun than watching a boring old politician declare why he should be president. Oh I know I have had the utmost interest in this campaign...but it's always the same thing from both the dems and the reps....so I don't think that I really missed anything by not seeing the speech. I most definitely had a better time  hanging out with Katie...nah...no regrets on my part. Besides I look at is as I was putting money back into our economy...could I be more patriotic?!

         Dear Homebuilders,       I just can't take it anymore....I can't stand it that you all won't update with me on time. My percentage is so low and I can't possibly keep up with your lack of responsiblity when it comes to selling your inventory. I have pretty much had about all I can take of your whining and moaning. So be that as it is, I am resigning as your Data rep and I am going to enter the lucrative world of phone acting. I think my services and talents will be better utilized there. Should you be interested in contacting me you can reach me at 1-888-jannicamp. For your future builder updates you can contact Jen Carl...well at least for the next two months until she bolts CA for the big steers in TX.&nbsp;&nbsp;       Yours truly,       Jannica Phillips       Data Rep Extrodanaire

        I just read on the Yahoo! News line that Warren Buffet's wife just died of a stroke. It's so odd how things like this happen. Just the other day I was listening to NPR and they were talking about how Susan Buffet was donating 6 million dollars to the medical center&nbsp;that treated her throat cancer and saved her life. I thought to myself about all the times that the Buffet family came into Signature and how easygoing they were and so low maintenance. They weren't like some of the pushy rich people that we would see sometimes. So today, when I read about Susan Buffet's death it just kind of hit me as ironic. I mean here is a person who I never read or hear about in the news and in one week I hear about her twice.&nbsp; I guess she made more of an impression on  me  because I personally helped her when she came into Signature and she complemented my hair when she came in, noting the pretty color of it. But who can blame her?? I mean my hair  is  beautiful!     &nbsp;

          That was my buzz phrase of the day yesterday that I decided to use once we found out our entire department was being relocated back to Phoenix.&nbsp; After making the fated migration to California one year ago and hiring 17 people the higher ups in our&nbsp;company(  urlLink  http://www.homestore.com    )found it in themselves reverse any work or progress that has been made out here and shift things back to where they were a year ago.             In essence this doesn't effect me whatsoever...due to the fact that I gave my notice a few weeks ago...so I am outta here and heading east to Atlanta.&nbsp;The actions of this company&nbsp;make me wonder though what the last year was all about. Was their purpose to any of this? I just wonder what direction my life was meant to head a year ago when I moved north to Thousand Oaks. I haven't felt any huge impact on my life from this whole experience...I mean I have always believed that everything happens for a reason. I just struggle to find the reason in all of this. Oh I am sure that down the road I will see where this all was meant to lead...but for now in the short term I have blinders on...and all I can see is&nbsp;that I spent the last year of my life wandering around and working for a company that doesn't really care for people and where I wasn't fulfilled as an individual. I will say this much...I made two very good friends while I was here and that in itself was worth the&nbsp;last year.
