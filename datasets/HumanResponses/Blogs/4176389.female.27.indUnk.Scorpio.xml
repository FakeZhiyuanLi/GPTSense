       urlLink Starware Toolbar   What a day.  Work has been unbeleivably busy, as we have been short a person for almost 2 months now.  That means I bust my butt more than usual everyday for now.  I am POOPED.  Had my JC weigh in today...only down .4 pounds.  WTF!?  I follow the plan better than I have since the beginning, actually get in a relative amount of exercise and that is all I get!?  Whatever.  SO....unfortunately I caved and had Dominos pizza for supper.  Only a few peices but still....I really should get off my rear and go exercise, but I would rather go to bed as I have to work another long day tomorrow.  It seems that I did better when I did not try so hard to be perfect, so perhaps I will go back to that and see what happens.  Worse yet, the only thing I feel guilty over, as how unguilty I feel over my choices for the day.  Pizza nad a cookie...isn't that what got me in this mess to start with?  I should have gone to TKD tonite, but opted to park my butt and watch Last Comic Standing.  I hope by tomorrow I get my head back on straight, and get back on track.  I MUST...crap.  I can't go on Thursday either, as Mom and I have tickets to a concert.  OUCH.  I feel really bad now.  At least the concert will be fun.  I havre not seen Mom for several days now, and that makes me feel bad- I LIKE hanging out with her.  Better make it a point to stop over there tomorrow.  Bet I can get her to go for a walk with me.  I did not feel well yesterday.  Every few days I wake up with an upset tummy and a headache.  Makes the whole day suck, saps my strength, and makes me grouchy.  Hope it is nothing that is here to stay.  Off to bed I go (I am so old!  In bed before 10?)...Here is to hoping that tomorrow is a better day.

      Okay I won't really go back that far. For this journal, I will only give a rundown on the important things....like I am married, have 2 wonderful feline children and that I finally made it through school, and now work as a chef in a hospital (weird I know). The last year had really been a rough one on our little fam....me commuting an hour each way to school, working 2 part time jobs, then hubby getting laid off right after Christmas, and me trying to py all the bills while still going to school. That semester was hell! But I made it, and only one "B" the whole year....wow- didn't even know that that was possible!  I plan to use this as my journal space for Jenny Craig, and hopefully at some point, to provide any person that reads it some insight and encouragement. I originally started JC about 4 years ago, after an argument that made me really look at myself, and try to decide if I needed to change. At the same time, I decided to quit smoking (under penalty of divorce!). It was a rough get go. Weighing in at close to 200 pounds really hurt....how the heck did that happen? I was only a little over a hundred when I graduated in '95. OUCH. Many consultants and years later, I managed to make my way down to 147 (lowest point yet-almost back to it!) After that, I let it fall on the wayside, until this year after I graduated and realized all the jeans I own were getting tighter, and tighter....  Back I went! Weighed in at 161, and have been on program for about 2 months now....down 12 pounds and 9.75 inches so far. This time, not only do I have a little different perspective, but I must be more serious about making a change, since I have been sticking with it better....  Enough for background.   Today I spent most of my day off at my mother-in-law's house with 2 sister- in-laws, and a family friend scrapbooking. I love to do this, but man! I can turn it into an expensive hobby easy! My one sister-in-law, April had her 1 month old baby Niam over too. He is getting big so quick. We picked up where we left off last nite, and kept at it. Now, this in itself is a huge challenge for me, because his family eats out a  LOT.  Last nite, they got pizza from Papa Murphy's, and I had 2 small slices, as I had not had lunch. Then I had a little piece of cake.....I did not eat my JC food or snack last nite, so I am hoping that it evens out. Today, for lunch they got Arby's...I ordered a side salad and had my JC tuna on it, but I REALLY wanted a roast beef. Mmmmm...  Tonight I am actually cooking for Jeremy before he has to work. He is getting turkey, and so am I! I really try to do it that way if I can, but at least he is a good sport about having a chef for a wife...that never cooks at home anymore! I just never have the ambition by the time I work 55 hours a week...and he works nites, so rarely are we home together for more than a few hours.   Speaking of, I should go check on his dinner. More Soon!
