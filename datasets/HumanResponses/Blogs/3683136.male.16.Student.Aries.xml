      Woke up very early on Saturday.  Got here around 3:30.  But it wasn't until after dinner that things got interesting.  A family friend (Jill) introduced me to this fellow (Ryan) who works here.  Ryan looks very much like Jude Law, and is quite darkly funny.  I took a fancy to him rather quickly.  Sunday was boring.  Managed to embarass myself in front of Ryan for the first time.  Again on Monday.  Tuesday got more interesting.  I was wandering around, and heard people shouting at me.  So I found them.  Now this was an interesting evening.  There were 4 of us.  Chris, Marshall, Ryan and I.  Now the ages were interesting.  Ryan, 19, me, 16, Marshall, 39, Chris, 28.  The group spanned 4 decades.  I spent the evening with 3 very drunk gay men.  The conversations were amusing, and I found out a lot of interesting shit, that's irrelevant to anyone that reads this.  I also had one of those weird "mentoresque" moments with them.  It was like: this is my life in 5, 10, 20 years.  I wonder where I'll actually be then?  -Mike  "Everyone's a little bit racist, sometimes, doesn't mean we go around commiting hate crimes.

      Today was interesting.  Not interesting in that "I hate everything and everyone way."  More interesting in a "pretty good" sorta way.  Woke up this morning.  Spent the night on my floor.  Very comfortable, surprisingly.  I'll probably do it again.  I think Louis has the right idea there.  Thanks kid.  Lunch with Gareth, home.  Left at 4 for the Center.  Got there around 5:10.  I was dissapointed.  I knew no one, and I felt really out of place there.  I enjoyed the discussion later, but for the most part I just felt awkward for a while.  I wanted to see Alex, but he didn't show.  Damn.  Got back to Linden, called sarah, and we drove around and ended up at the beach, which is always nice.  I'm glad we "made up" or whatever.  And we talked about a lot of shit, so I think we're fine.  This is good.  I worry about Sarah a lot.  She's my best friend, but I feel like I'm so helpless when she tells me shit.  I find it so hard to empathize.  And that just sucks.  The only thing worse than feeling really shitty is feeling really shitty and not being able to do anything about it.  My parents are acting eerily normal.  Is reconciliation in the cards?  I doubt it.  I hope it is.  But I doubt it.  -Mike  "I've got to admit it's getting better, it's getting better, all the time."

      Every once in a while I get in a fight with Sarah.  It happened again.  It kind of sucks.  Her timing could not have been worse.  Yea, I fucked up.  But it's forgiveable.  She doesn't see that now, maybe she will.  Who knows.  It's almost as if I don't care anymore.  Sarah's right.  We're both different people.  If she wants to bitch about Sean, it's her perogative.  If she wants to hook up with random guys, I can't judge.    Whatever, fuck it.  I'll talk later.  -Mike "They were to weak, to prone to break. their needs to deep, their skin to thick by now you took what was to take, tear it apart and start again."

      I just found an envelope that said "Frank- Read every page and enjoy."  They were a collection of e-mail exchanges between my dad and his misstress.  My mom printed them out and annotated them.  Wow.  My dad is a bastard.  He lied all the time.  He denied things that were true.  The man is a bastard.  I fucking hate him.  I will never forgive the bastard for what he did.  But now he's out of the house.  I don't know where he is.  I'd ask my mom, but she's too upset right now.  I hope he fucking goes to hell.  He's a despicable person.  I want him to fucking die.  This sounds overblown.  It sounds like I'm being that bitchy attention whore that I complain about so often.  But seriously.  The man ruined my life, he ruined my mother's life.  Just because he had sex with my mom roughly 17 years ago doesn't mean I have to love, like, or respect him.  I'm afraid of what this will do to my life though.  I wish I knew more about divorce law.  My mom doesn't have a job.  Will she have to get one?  Will my dad be a bastard and withhold money?  Will the divorce precedings be bloody and drive them even farther apart?  At least I have one less worry now though.  I mean, my parents suck.  I'm pissed at both of them.  I feel sorry for my mom.  But I love Center on Halsted.  I had so much fun last time.  Hopefully tomorrow night will be the same.  I feel so comfortable with those people.  I feel... normal.  Everything I think becomes the norm.  And that's cool.  Acceptance is fun.  But not only that, I've gained so much confidence.  I see guys, and I'm willing to think of them in that way.  I had a conversation with my brother about my sexuality.  I just feel so much more comfortable in my own skin now.  "It's a good thing."  -Mike  "Today seems like a good day, to burn a bridge or two.

      I was thinking today, and I think cartilage piercing are really cool.  So the question is:  Should I get my cartilage pierced?  Yes or no, preferably with reasons (not that I know who reads this... Please leave names).  Thanks -Mike

      Looks like the Darkness/OK Go trip with Chip (hehe... I rhymed) is cancelled.  He's going to a charity screening of Fahrenheit 9/11 or some such nonsense.  Which isn't entirely bad.  Means I'll probably end up back at Center on Halsted.  I want to see Alex again before I leave, and get some way of contacting him.  Back to the present.  Saw dodgeball today.  Excellent movie.  I'd higly reccomend seeing it.  It's self-conciously stupid funny.  Time for tonights emo portion: My house sucks right now.  Looks my parents relationship is at the breaking point.  I talked to them last night.  Told them that I couldn't take the fighting, the house shaking, the screaming, the door slamming, etc. anymore.  So they had to do something or get over it.  Looks like they're doing something.  So in a roundabout way, I may have inadvertently kicked my dad out of my house.  He deserves it.  Cheating bastard.  There is nothing unclear about his situation.  Everything that's happened is his fault.  If he can't respect 30 something years of marriage, he doesn't deserve to be here.  He's a fucking bastard.  No wonder my mom is unable to forgive him.  In addition to all of that, I'm starting to feel like a pariah whenever I'm with my friends.  I get this vibe that nobody likes me.  It's really irritating, and this sounds like I'm fishing for compliments.  It's a shitty feeling.  I feel like I'm being put up with out of necessity.  I think that's why I enjoyed last night so much.  It made me feel like people were being genuinely nice.  I felt like I finally fit in.  Everything felt normal.  I can't wait to go back.  -Mike  "I can't get to sleep, think about the implications. of diving in too deep. and possibly the complications. especially at night, I worry over situations.

      The verdict: I'm happy.  I'm very happy.  And my hair is yellow.  Huzzah.  So apparently the meeting on mondays at COH is at 5:00.  I should remember that.  Anyway, what ended up happening was that I hung out with a bunch of cool people around the belmont/halsted area.  Lots of fun.  Much cool stuff and cool people.  Particularly cool was this guy named Alex.  Really nice guy, funny.  Flamboyant, but not ridiculously so.  Talked a lot.  Vaguely cute.  Cool accent.  (He has a boyfriend.)  Anyway, that was fun.  Definitely going back.  Chip should be home within a couple hours.  -Mike  "Leave it on the back burner, take it to the drytown, yea, here we go."

      Anxiousness has swept over me like a tornado of arms and teeth and fingernails.  I'm so worried about tomorrow.  "What if they don't like me?  What if I don't talk for 3 hours?" all of that stuff.  It's crazy.  I'm not sure I want to do this anymore.  In other news, hung out with Katie and Sarah this afternoon.  SNM has a boyfriend.  Interesting development.  Crazy development.  I'm always unhappy when other people are happy.  That's really not a good sign.  It probably means I really am cynical.  Which pisses me off.  Just like everything else.  I think I'm trapped in a "shame spiral."  Teehee.  I think I'll rent the first few episodes of Nip Tuck tonight.  I hope it's good.  Three cheers for escapism.  -Mike  "I thought I'd write, I thought I'd let you know. That the years since you've been gone I've finally let you go."

      Morning post.  Last night was interesting.  Yesterday was a few hours of boredom, followed by about 4 hours of poker.  Got knocked out before money was distributed.  Damn.  Went to Louis's house, and that's when things started to get interesting.  Upon arrival, Louis said something about ice cream.  mMm... ice cream.  Ate some of that.  And then, I engaged in a wonderful 5th grade, Tim Smithe-esque activity.  I played pokemon cards.  If this is something you haven't done, I'd highly reccomend it.  Very little skill required.  Basically none at all.  just luck of the draw and luck of the coin.  After several hours of that, James and Louis went to sleep.  And Julian and I went to work.  We took a wonderful little felt tipped marker, and wrote all over Louis's bathroom (don't worry, it came off.)  It was crazy fun.  Woke up this morning.  Tired as shit, but happy.  It's a start.  -Mike  "Drivin' on the lawn, sleeping on the roof, drinkin' all the alcohol. All the kids from school, will be naked in the pool, while our parents are on, Fire Island."

      I finally replaced ye olde Ipod.  That makes me happy.  Yep, material goods make me happy.  Whatcha gonna fuckin' do about it, punk?  I find it kind of amusing.  I've been bitching lately that I feel empty.  But I've found that material goods can often serve as a good way to substitute friends ;)  That was a retarded smiley.  -Mike  "She dreams a champagne dream strawberry surprise, pink lenin on white paper."

      Today is a day for something other than this.  I don't know what I'm going to do today, but goddamnit it's going to be something worthwhile.  $10 says Gareth is hanging out with Ja today.  No takers?  I wonder why...  So last night after my Blitz of posts, I began reading "Ecstasy Club," a novel by a fellow named Doug Rushkoff.  It's about a bunch of club kids and raves and such.  Seems like an interesting book.  I guess I'll wait and see.  I suddenly have the urge to gamble.  I wonder if there is poker to be had anywhere in the area.  -Mike  "Something in the way she explains to me,"Please be careful, I exist in someone else's head," oh no.

      This country needs more protests.  That was a defining aspect of the 60s... there were protests everywhere.  Our country is still locked in political debates of controversial nature and even more controversial subject matter.  But still nobody is able to effectively utilize a good protest.  Why is that?  It seems we have a lot of things to blame.  First of all, there are no rallying point causes anymore.  The only thing anybody cared about was the war.  But that's essentially over.  what we need is bra-burning, social issue protests.  But unfortunately, nobody seems to give a shit about gay marriage, which seems to be quickly becoming the social issue of the current generation.  Our politicians avoid it.  Christians abhor it.  It's just that sort of issue that everyone either is apathetic about, or against.    Not me though.  I e-mailed the white house about it.  They responded somewhere along these lines:  "Thank you for your interest in white house policy.  We read each letter carefully, and take it into account."  Bullshit.  You know That they have a special e-mail address for important people.  Important people like Jerry Falwell, that is.  - Mike "Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam" dickerson.

      My day was interesting.  I rolled out of bed, I finished   Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs,   By the illustrious Chuck Klosterman.  It's a fascinating book for the VH1 Junkie.  If you know your pop culture shit, you will enjoy this.  If you don't, you will think it is utter and complete garbage.  Later on, after a shower, I did nothing.  Well, not entirely.  I played bass and listened to Franz Ferdinand (who are awesome... by there album.)  I watched Jeopardy, on which this guy has now won over $440,000.  He is unstoppable.  Anyway, later Sarah called.  "It gon rain." she said.  and thus, my search for a new recipient of a ravinia ticket began.  After a few failed attempts, I called James Noyes.  And wound up with a bit of an upgrade.  I ended up inside the pavilion.  Ben folds was awesome.  James's family were nice people.  although his brother was really annoying.  He asked a lot of irritating questions.  Not that I'm bitching about free tickets and dinner.  His parents tried to get me to come to an Obama fundraiser.  It was quite amusing.  After the show, we swapped some musical interests, and I went home.  Forgot to watch new Degrassi (grr... tomorrow I suppose).  and since then I've done nothing.  And that's my life as of now.  -Mike  "I pushed you 'cuz I loved you guys, I didn't realize, you weren't having fun."

      In honor of the upcoming google IPO, I've decided to go public with some pieces of information that others might find interesting.  And all of this occurs as the background to something that I decided on today.  You know those whiny teen support groups for various causes?  Well I've decided to join one.  Well, tentatively decided to tentatively join one.  Now what cause could Mike possibly have to join a whiny support group, you say?  Mike likes guys.  Mike is uncertain whether he likes girls.  He probably does.  But that could change in the future.  Consider this my metaphorical "Initial public offering."  Anyway, so I've been doing some research, and monday I'll probably go down to the "center on Halsted," which is apparently number one GLBT community center in Chicago.  Maybe it will have to wait.  We shall see.  Wednesday that pride group meets at Links.  I might go to that.  We'll see how things work out.  Then there's the issue of my parents.  Hmm, so complicated.  Cheers, -Mike  "Rockin' the suburbs, just like Rufus Wainwright does..."

      I am Mike's asshole friend.  &nbsp;  In my mind right now, my friends are having the times of their life.&nbsp; Sarah is drunk and making out with Simon.&nbsp; Katie is laughing hysterically at the events unfolding.  &nbsp;  This is the party in Sarah's basement.&nbsp; This is the party that's occuring in my mind.  &nbsp;  Another screwdriver down the hatch.&nbsp; Another chuckle at the happiness that Mike couldn't join them.  &nbsp;  I am Mike's Pariah.  &nbsp;  I sit at home, by myself watching crappy television.&nbsp; This is my life.&nbsp; I type on my laptop.&nbsp; I self-indulgently think about the people who read this.&nbsp; I wish I were famous.&nbsp; I wish I had lots of money.&nbsp; I want to be a hollywood celebrity.&nbsp; I want to be worshipped.  &nbsp;  I pat myself on the back for immitating chuck palahniuk.  &nbsp;  I am Jack's stolen mind.  _____________________________________________________ &nbsp;  For the record, most of what I just wrote is entirely sarcastic.&nbsp; I just had that thought in the car today, "My friends are having the time of their life.&nbsp; This is all occuring in my head."&nbsp; Or some such nonsense... decided to write.  &nbsp;  I am Mike's failed attempt at writing something meaningful.  &nbsp;  -Mike  &nbsp;  The time is right,  but I feel all wrong.

      This is not a diary.  A diary is my innermost thoughts.  A diary is a daily routine.  This is something entirely different.  Why would anyone want to have a fucking online journal?  I've come up with a lot of reasons since becoming a dedicated blogger.  A blog serves as a method of organization.  I can read through old posts and figure out what I've been feeling.  Not only that, it's a way to tell people who you are and how you're feeling without a lot of unnecesarily awkward conversations.  Not only that, but I feel a lot more comfortable talking about myself and who I am now.  My blog allowed me to come out publicly.  I like that.  My blog has allowed me to bitch without getting on the nerves of my friends.  But what I've learned from this is an entirely different question.  I think that I've realized how fucked up my life, and everyone else's really are.  We really are unique.  We all have fucked up problems.  I've also realized that I am a troubled person, as much as I'd like to think that I am satisfied.  There is so much shit I want to accomplish.  This is kind of a log of that, but also a mark of my failures.  I want to amount to something.  I don't want to just make money.  I want to give something back.  I think this post exemplifies my blog.  insightful (I hope,) but most of all rambling and incoherent.  -Mike

      I'm about to get preachy.  But don't worry, it's not directed at you, loyal reader and hopefully fan.  No, this is directed at me.  After long talks with Simon and Sarah on Tuesday night, I think I'm ready for a little publicly posted self-analysis.  So prepare for a self-esteem lowering fest.  There are a lot of things I really don't like about myself.  I think that most of the things Sarah said were at least to some extent true.  I am controlling.  I constantly think I know what's best for people.  And often, I'll do things that are horribly stupid and mean for the purposes of getting my way.  And it sucks about me.  My opinion is not worth more than everyone else's.  I don't have life experiences that make me better or wiser than others.  No matter what I'd like to think.  I'm also excessively dismissive.  I often don't listen to what other people have to say.  While I don't think sarah was right about our evening chats though... I think I did learn a lot about her.  But I think she is right about some of the times that I hang out with others.  I noticed it tonight even... I'm constantly mocking people because of what they do.  It's really shitty of me.  I need to work on that.  I need to work on not being such a bitch all the time.  It's definitely one of my worst qualities.  I'm sooooo critical.  I think I put my foot in my mouth a lot, and to compensate for it I try to bring down others.  It sucks, it makes me feel bad, it makes others feel bad.  I've always been kind of aware of this stuff.  I think that's why I feel like a pariah sometimes.  I definitely can sense when people are not liking me.  And it sucks because it makes me react by becoming more of an ass.  This is why I hate myself.  But at least I can recognize it.  (Note: Addendum, added several hours later)  Admission and acceptance are the first steps to change, or so they say.  I'm kind of glad I got this all out of my system, for a lot of reasons.  I was really offended when sarah told me all of this.  The fact that I heard it from someone else helped me to accept it in a lot of ways.  I've always known that I'm a pushy asshole type, but maybe I can change that.  Like Simon said, maybe this is the kind of learning experience he had.  I mean, I guess I've always been an advocate of the sort of "tough love" approach.  I think this may have been the wake up call that I needed.  I guess we'll have to see.  -Mike  You float like a feather, in a beautiful world, I wish I was special, you're so fuckin special.  but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here.

      I had GOOD times this weekend, especially on Sunday night.  After a trip out late at night, Sarah and I were walking and talking.  And then the popo showed up.  Fuck the police (fuck. fuck. fuck...).  We got busted for violating curfew.  Soooo much fun.  My parents aren't too pissed though.  And they're not blaming her as much as I thought they would.  I found out some information that kind of hurt me.  I don't really want to go into it in public, but wow... not cool.  Not cool at all.  __________________________________________________________ (Note: If you're not interested in another "gay entry," stop reading now)  Mike's Confusion.  I've been thinking more and more lately about whether I like girls.  And the more I think about it, the more I think it just isn't true.  I'm still confused, I guess.  But it's getting less confusing as time goes on.  I've realized that the more time goes by, the less I'm interested in girls.  But I almost feel like sexual frustration is leaving me confused.  I really want a boy to date.  The lack of real candidates pisses me off.  I dunno, as desperate as this is I just want someone to like.  But I've got no one really.  It's just frustrating.  I can't wait until I get out of high school.  I want to meet people.  I want to have a relationship.  Maybe I should start going to CTA meetings and stuff.  Or Links things.  I wish I had been here for the pride parade and stuff.  Damn.  I wish I weren't leaving on sunday.  I really want to go to this Synergy dance thing on Saturday night.  Hmm... maybe I could.  I think I'd have to come out to my mom.  That'd be awkward.  Train making would be hard.  I'd also leave the day after.  I guess it can wait.  I think I am going to come out to my mom.  Stuff just keeps getting in the way.  Getting in trouble, my parents fighting.  Maybe I'll just do it tomorrow.  That'd be good.  I want to do it.  It'll make my life easier.  I hate being a political issue.  It's so dehumanizing to read articles about gay contituencies, and gay issues, and blah blah blah.  I don't want to be a statistic or a "wedge social issue."  I don't want something that directly affects my future to be decided for political gain.  I hate the GoP.  I hate the dems refusal to support me.  I hate that our country is full of christian moralists who think that I'm going to hell.  Whatever.  I'll deal. -Mike  backed my car into a cop car the other day  Well he just drove off, sometimes life's OK  I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh what did I say?  Well you just laughed it off, it was all OK   And we'll all float on OK

      I left you in the morning, still drunk on melodrama, you're so pretty so, natural but I had to salvage honor.  down the spiral staircase, the television I bought you, took a deep breath, of your endless love perfume.  The carnage that the storm left 6 inches on the ground. the south side of chicago, stands eerily so sound.  I looked up at your window, hand out as if to touch you, you used to be so perfect, how did I ever need you?

      I was driving home from the dentist a few minutes ago.  And I got to thinking, someday I want to have children.  Not soon.  But like, maybe 15-20 years from now.  But then I got scared.  What if I end up with a guy?  I guess I'm selfish, but I want my genetic material to be part of the child I raise.  And even then, what if I can't adopt because of fucked up discriminatory laws?  Fuck this.  Sometimes I just think I should ignore all this.  I don't need to question my sexuality.  I could just act like a regular heterosexual teenager.  It's not like I'm flamboyant or even effeminite.  God damnit.  This is why I don't believe in god.  If god made us, he'd want us to be happy.  But why the fuck did he make things so difficult for so many people?  Fuck god.  God let columbine happen.  God let world war 2 happen.  (s)he let's people take their own lives.  (S)he literally kills people.  How can anyone have faith in some sort of all powerful being?  Every time I question my own atheism, I eventually come to that same conclusion.  Why the fuck would god put us here and then leave us?  Why is Jesus so well loved when Sun-Yun Moon (sp?) is mocked by everyone.  For all we know, Charles Manson could be the second coming of christ.  God kills people, so why not his son?  Nah, parents are too hypocritical.  God would definitely tell jesus that he couldn't kill people, even though god did it during the 60s.  Or maybe god would just do something so fucked up that Jesus would lose all respect for him.  Fuck, it must really suck to be Jesus.  That was incoherent.  I apologize. -Mike  Walked around my good intentions, and found that there were none. I blame my father for the wasted years, we hardly talked. I never thought I would forget this pain, then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong.  And if I don't make it known that, I loved you all along. Just like sunny days that, we didn't know because. we're all dumb and jaded, and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.  Walked around my room not thinking, sinking in this box. I blame myself for being  too much like somebody else I never thought I would just bend this way then a phone call made me realize I'm wrong.  And if I don't make it known that, I loved you all along. Just like sunny days that, we didn't know because. we're all dumb and jaded, and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.  and I hope to god I figure out what's wrong.

      I've been feeling a lack of inspiration everytime I've tried to update lately.  I guess I just don't feel the need.  I've spent a ridiculous amount of time with sarah over the last couple days, and our conversations are better than a non-responsive journal, frankly.  I'm so glad that we still have that bond where we can (and do) talk about everything that's going on.    The last couple nights (mornings?) we've been meeting on the bike trail and hanging out really late at night (early in the morning?).  We just wander and talk about stuff.  It's interesting.  I feel more honest late at night.  and our silences are never awkward.  it's odd.  Lexi (my brother's friend) is really cool.  I got some advice from her tonight, and I think she's right.  I should follow it.  anyway, I'm not really stressed, so I feel little need to say much else. -Mike  "Don't don't don't let's start, This is the worst part, to believe for all the world, that you are my precious little girl"

      I'm having a normal teenage urge.  I want to kill some brain cells.  Perhaps it will happen tonight.

      Where do I begin to describe what happened to me between 3 and 4 am?  Gareth and Ja decided to amicably separate.  I think it's probably the right decision.  With Ja going to college and Gareth being a junior and all, both of them are going to be having very fully years.  I hope things work out for them.  Gareth started reading this thing, and now knows a lot more about my life than he did at this time yesterday.  Which is good.  I'd wanted to tell him so much of this stuff, but I just couldn't.  Sarah caved.  I'm happy because of it.  I'm really glad that she chose to start bitching to me again.  I think it was a bad idea to not tell anyone anything.  It could only lead to badness.  Also, Sarah revealed some shit in her journal last night that's pretty shocktastic.  I'm oh so happy for her though, because she finally declared her public joining of the vast conspiracy.  Well, after finally going to sleep around 4, I sat in bed for several hours.  Around 5, the damn birds started chirping, and around 5:30 it was fully light outside.  That fucking sucked.  So I wound up with maybe 4 hours of sleep tonight.  I guess I'll just drink lots of Caffiene.  But I'm going to try to go back to sleep.  Wish me luck. -Mike  Shalala, shalala, shalala, the end is growing near

      After the terrible traveling yesterday, I had an excellent day today.  I spent a bunch of time with Gareth, we went to the beach which was lots of fun and played on the awesome (and dangerous) new playground at Tower.  Then we headed over to the Fireworks.  They were a lot of fun.  We met up with Katie and Sarah, and we all went to the beach.  Sarah and I walked aways down the beach, and had interesting conversations.  I love the beach, it's the only place where I have really good conversations.  It's kind of odd.  I guess it's a nature thing.  I'm happy because despite my disagreement with Sarah's whole not telling shit bit, we still have good conversations about everything.  We talked a lot about simon and Sam, and about my ridiculous crush, and whether or not bisexuality exists and all that.  I should spend more time at the beach.  -Mike  "Make a whole with a gun perpendicular, to the name of this town in a desktop globe, exit wound in a foreign nation, marking the home of the one this was written for."

      I have this weird habit.  I don't think I've ever talked about it before.  I guess I always assumed it was somewhat normal.  I have these extremely detailed scenarios... like, real scenarios that are going to happen.  But I plan them out meticulously in my head.  I think about what I'm going to say when whatever I decide happens happens.  I'll often talk to myself during the course of all of this planning and such.  That's what happened tonight.  Plans fall through.  Events get moved.  Anyway, I was supposed to watch The Big Lebowski with a bunch of chill people.  I'm angry because it fell through.  It makes me more angry because it means I don't get to see Ryan.  This stupid obsessive crush is killing me, I swear.  But the worst part is I had this whole evening planned and it wound up (in my head) that I was talking alone with Ryan and ugh... damn him and his fucking charm.  This is ridiculous.  My school girl crush has turned into a creepy, almost stalker-like obsession.  But hey, I'll probably never see him again after tomorrow, so whatever.  And while I take some solace in this, it also makes me very sad.  Maybe he'll be here next year.  Probably not.  but who knows.  Abrupt change of subject: My dad gave me the infamous "no matter what happens between your mother and I, we'll always love you" speech.  I hate this therapist social worker bullshit.  It's the only thing worse than the two of them fighting.  I talked to my brother about it.  He thinks I should stop giving my dad a hard time about all of this, because he doesn't need that.  But frankly, I think he deserves the hard time that I've been giving him.  My brother didn't have to live through my parents fighting on a pretty much nightly basis.  He didn't have to stay awake because there was no silence.  He didn't have to hear the shrieking and the crying.  None of it.  Here's the fully story on my father.  Apparently, some time ago (pretty long, as in a couple years maybe?) he began an affair with one of the women that worked at his company's travel agency.  They had a long affair.  I read a bunch of their e-mail correspondences and frankly, they disgust me.  He acts like he just doesn't have a wife and kids.  Moreover, he lied about everything to my mother repeatedly, and took a long time to reveal what actually happened.  That is what transpired to the best of my knowledge.  I apologize for any errors.  I've never gotten a straight story from either of my parents.  Back to present tense. Ryan.  Ugh.  My heart is crazy just thinking about him.  Honestly, he's all I've thought about for the last 4 days.  It's really fucking crazy.  I feel psycho.  This is actually somewhat embarassing to write.    But hey, I'll get over it.  -Mike (Who apologizes profusely for the excessive length of this entry)  There's a fine fine line, between a lover, and a friend. and there's a fine fine line. between reality, and pretend.

      I LOVE DEBATE! I LOVE DEBATE CAMP!  my time here has been interesting.  My emotions have been all over the place, but for the past couple days I've settled at content (with some time/work related stress).  Events of the past 3 weeks:  My first (personal) encounter with Homophobia: Seungwon Chung is a fucking asshat.  Around the beginning of week 2, I was in the library, and this kid behind me (Seungwon) was talking about some shit, and said some really homophobic shit.  It really upset me, I confronted him about it, he asked if I was gay, I said yes, and then he told me that he was uncomfortable around gay people.  That bothered me... I was really upset for a couple days.  But things are ok, I suppose... this is something I have to learn to deal with.  there's so little significance to everything.  MY HAIR IS FUSCHIA.  IT'S FUCKING PINK. AND I GOT TWO SHIRTS AT GAP THAT ROCK.  YAY.  -Mike  Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know, that something wasn't right here.
