      I think that this blog has gone to Avram's head.  Since  have started this fansite, he has burst into flames.  It seems that Sara and Avram have been disagreeing on the events of the weekend.  For the record, Avram was drunk.   end of story on all accounts.

      So, Avram has resurfaced.  I do not know if this is due to the inspiration that this fansite has brought him or because he was just ready to blog again.  But I do know one thing and that is that we love his blogs.  Now, don't worry I am not going to just retire this blog the same day that I started it.  That is not going to happen.  We are going to continue to bring the life of Avram to all the little people.    Now that we have established all that I would like to put out a big reminder that June 14 (Flag Day) is Avram's Birthday.  That is on Monday, so we better start partying this weekend.  Do we get off for Flag Day?

      So, av likes to paint this picture that he is no good with ladies... but I beg to differ.  Even back in the highschool days he was a souper-pimp and didn't even realize it.  Here an IM conversation I recently had with a mutual friend of ours from highschool which illustrates my point (some IM names have been changed to protect the innocent and this is NOT Rachel Cohen):   trev555555:  me and avram are still good friends   trev555555:  I see him once or twice a week   rachel:  really?   trev555555:  yep   rachel:  what is he up to?   trev555555:  hes temping at this one place and being a substitute teacher   rachel:  remember when i was in love him?     rachel:  those were the days   trev555555:  no.. man... thats crazy   trev555555:  you were in love with av?   rachel:  shayna liked him too   trev555555:  shayna did!!!???  See... right under our noses, women the world around have a passion for avram.  And for that, I must tip my hat.

      avram works in very mysterious ways.  when we first met avram it was through the cryptic messages he left on our dorm dry-erase message boards.  they said something like "avram says 'hi' 3:40am".  or something.  this weird approach to communicating with the opposite sex is still a big part of being avram.  recently he's been canvasing for people who want to add a little "av diggity to the rotation".  and by that i believe he's referring to the rotation that pot makes when you smoke it and pass it.  but av - what about the rotation that i make every work day when i check out people's blogs on the internet?  that is where i've been missing the av diggity.  however maybe this is something more celestial.  i've noticed i've also not been blogging regularly.  and this morning i woke up with a sore throat for some reason.  am i getting sick?  ya - sick of avram not blogging anymore!!

      It seems that Avram has fallen off the face of the internet.  I know that he has stuff to blog about.  He only calls me at least 3 times a day while I am at my desk.  For example, I know that Avram recently visited Atlantic City and attended a wedding.  These are things worth mentioning, however, Avram has not blogged since  urlLink  May 19  and that did not tell us anything about his life.    So, I have started this blog to fill in for what Avram is not telling us.  I will not spill Avram's deep dark secrets, but only maintain his internet existance that we have all grown to love.    If you have stories to tell about Avram please feel free to email me at sara.kaplan@gmail.com and I will send you the login info so that you can add your own Avram posts.
