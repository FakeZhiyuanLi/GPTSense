      I love you but why D heck are you alwyz giving me cry-headache...  Silver gray hair neatly combed in place.  There were four generations of love on her face.  She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes,  She'd seen it all.   I was a child, oh, about three or four.  All day I'd ask questions.  At night I'd ask more.  But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.   I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong ?  And why does what I want always take so long ?  Please tell me where does God live  And why won't He talk to me ?   I'd say, Grandma what is love ?  Will I ever find out ?  Why are we so poor, what is life about ?  I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep.   She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.  Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.  But tonight she was slightly, remarkably  Different somehow   Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.  Grandma yawned as she stretched.  Then she started to speak.  What she told me, would mold me, and hold me  Together inside.   She said all the things you ask  You will know someday.  But you have got to live in a patient way.  God put us here by fate  And by fate that means better days.   She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.  Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right.  Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.  You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.   You can't get to no better days  Unless you make it through the night.  Oh, you will see those better days  But you gotta be patient.  (Be patient) oh baby, be patient.   Later that year, at the turn of spring,  Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.  Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding  In better days   And although I'm all grown up  I still get confused.  I stumble through the dark  Getting bumped and bruised.  When night gets in my way  I could still hear my Grandma say  I can hear her say,  I can hear her say.   (Be patient) You can't get to no better days  Unless you make it through the night baby.  (Be patient) Oh, you will see those better days  But you gotta be patient.  Child, do you hear me, yeah.   (Be patient) You can't get to no better days  Unless you make it, you got to make it  you got to make it  You got to make it through the night   (Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma  Do you see me now, lady  Oh oh oh oh oh...   (Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee  She used to comb my hair  She used to tell me stories..  My Grandma took me everywhere

      Fallin out, fallin in  Nothin's sure in this world, no no  Breakin out, breakin in  Never knowin what lies ahead  We can really never tell it all   Say goodbye, say hello  To a lover or friend  Sometimes we couldn't just understand  Why good things begin then just end  We can really never have it all   But/coz oh, can't you see  That no matter what happens  Life goes on and on  So baby just/please SMILE  Coz i'm always around you  And i'll make you see  How beautiful life is for you and me    Take a little time baby  See the butterflies colors  Listen to the birds that were sent  To sing for me and you  Can you feel me  This is such a wonderful place to be   Even if there is pain now  Everything will be alright  For as long as the world still turns  There will be night and day  Can you hear me  There's a rainbow always after the rain   Hittin high, hittin low  Win or lose you should go  Getting warm, getting cold  Weather could be so good or bad  But baby this is life  Now don't get mad   Life's full of challenges  Not all the time we get what we want  But don't despair my dear  (And i know that) You'll take each trial  And you'll make it through the storm coz you're strong  My faith in you is clear  So i'll say once again this world is wonderful  And let us celebr
