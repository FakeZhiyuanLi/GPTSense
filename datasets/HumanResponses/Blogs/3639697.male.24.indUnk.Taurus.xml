       It has been really busy at work, so I haven't had the chance to write anything recently.  We had an article in the  New Idea  about one of our Newmarket clients and the response from that has been enormous!  So much in fact that we have been struggling to keep up with our daily duties!  I have even being logging in remotely from home and clearing some of the emails from Outlook to make it easier the next day.  But apart from that, it is good that we are getting a good response especially at this time of the year.  Adios for now, I will keep you updated.

          This is the view from Mount Eden.  I think it is the best view to see the Sky Tower.  The lights at night are stunning, but it is very windy on top of the mount.

       Today was one of those days where we didn't know what to do with ourselves.  We didn't know what we wanted for dinner, didn't know what to do for the night.  We even went to the video store too see what was there but we were too late, all the good stuff had already gone out.  So we decided to partake in a little game we call  Random Roads.    Random Roads  is where you just drive, and turn at roads or intersections where you haven't been before and see where it takes you.  Rebecca and I have found many restaurants, sights and lovely houses by doing this, and is the best way to learn your way around a city.  I have been here for about 11 months now and there are still areas in Auckland that I haven't even been near.  After going this for about 30 minutes we went for a drive to Mt Eden, one of Auckland's largest mounts.  This spot gives you the best view of the city and the skytower.  I even took some photo's, which once I have made them small enough, i will place them here so you can see them.  If any of you follow the rugby, the All Blacks played the Argentinian Pumas and it was a lack luster effort if that.  The All Blacks had made 10 changes to the team to give the substitutes some game time.  Even though we one 41-7, the Pumas were even worse!  Melissa and Geoff (Auntie & Uncle) have found a new house to live in!  I haven't had the chance to see it yet but it sounds 100% better than what they are currently living in.  They move in on the 17th of July, only 5 days before I leave, so i will be helping them move.  I can't wait to see the house, and it even has a very large  SPA BATH!.   Tomorrow we are going to the Titirangi Markets (I think that is how it is spelt), so tomorrow I will let you know how it goes and what it is like, maybe even post some photo's as well!

       I am going to give you a run down on Kiwi television. We have 4 major free to air television stations:  TV1 This channel is like the ABC in Australia. It contains lots of content from the BBC, and D.I.Y shows. Can contain a bit of crap, but can come up with the occasional good show.  TV2 This is the mainstream channel, a lot like channel 9 or 7. This channels shows the higher rating sitcoms and the home of the famous SHORTLAND STREET. I tend to watch this channel more than everything else.  TV3 Channel 3 is like TV2, but not so highly rated. Showing more older, but still quite funny shows, and a lot more local content than TV1.  C4 This is NZ's newest music station and also features a large amount of kiwi music. Late night C4 shows Jackass and also South Park, and a little known show called the Jamie Kennedy Experiment.  There is also Maori TV, some World TV channel, and PRIME TV, which is a sister company to Channel 9, so there is a lot of Australian content on this channel (the block, etc).  Over here Friends has just finished, and Third Watch is coming to an end. I didn't think too much about the ending of Friends, but the rest of the show was funny. Also Third Watch is going to be a thriller, I wonder if Cruize will be bumped off the show?!  Enough about that, and onto the crappy weather we have been having recently! Auckland suffered gale force winds, rain and the occasion hail as well. It is also very very cold tonight...i don't think it has been this cold for a long time. Can't wait to get to Roxby Downs next month and get away from the cold weather....and to see my family of  course!  Well, that's it for another day. Have a good one.  BTW, I LOVE YOU REBECCA!

       Would like everyone to know that we have finally confirmed the details for our Australian trip!!  We fly into Sydney is on the 22nd July @ 8:00am, then hop onto Virgin Blue to arrive in Adelaide at 11.30am. We then return on the 28th @ 3:40pm to arrive in Sydney @6pm.  We are staying with Rebecca's auntie in the city.  We fly out the next morning @ 9:00am to return back to Auckland.  I have also just returned from watching Shrek 2 on the Mega Screen at Village@Queen Street, and I have to tell you, it amazing!  Not only have they added more detail with the graphics, but the story line is extremely funny.  I am not going to give away the story, but tell you to go and see it.  Also wait for the credits cause their is a small bit during them that is funny and disturbing at the same time......I'll let you think about that one!  I will be adding some photo links to this site of Rebecca and I, so you can see what she looks like!  She is really keen to see everyone, and I am keen to catch up with everyone as well!

       It is now very early thursday morning and I can't seem to sleep!  Thought I might jump online and check out some of my sites that I haven't been to for a while.  I think it is because I have way too things in my mind right now, like my trip to australia, our programming department for work, engagement to plan for....enough to make anyone worry a little, especially the last thing!  We are receiving delivery of some of the equipment for our programming department tomorrow...can't wait to get my hands on it.  Not sure how long I will be spending on setting it up, but we have someone coming in for the day to cover for me just in case.  I have al lot to plan for and get working properly before I leave on the 22nd.  If anybody wants to get hold of me, and doesn't have my email address, it is  kurt_haines@clear.net.nz   This is going to change in the next few weeks but it will still be working up until the end of christmas.  I want to catch up with everybody and what they are up to.  It has been a long time since I have had any contact with people from Australia (except you Mark).  Well, i think this has made me a little tired now so I think I will hit the sack and try and get to sleep before it get's too early.  Speak to you soon.

       Rebecca has managed to strain both her calf muscles at a recent visis to the gym.  But itisn't entirely her fault!  It was her first visit in a very very long time (2-3 years).  The guy showing her the equipment increased the resistance on the calf raise machine to a level that was way too high for both her body and a first timer.  She didn't feel it till the next day, when it started to hurt, then Thursday morning found that she couldn't stand straight!  I took her to the physiotherapist yesterday afternoon and he confirmed what I thought.  So I have stayed at her house since Wednesday night and will be there all weekend as my house has stairs which isn't good for her.  It has been extremely painful for her, and finds it very difficult to sleep at night, which has kept me from sleeping well myself.  Hopefully by monday she should be able to walk, or limp quickly...either way!  Gotta get back to work! Chikka chow
