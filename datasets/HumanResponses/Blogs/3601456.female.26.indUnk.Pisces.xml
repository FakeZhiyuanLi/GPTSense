      My lovely and fabulous Tivo recorded the E! True Hollywood Story of Diff'rent Strokes.  I love my Tivo because I didn't ask it to record it, it just did (not that I wouldn't have told it to if I had known it was coming on).  This was quality programming because the kids of the show were very screwed- but we loved them!  Which prompts me to say: Everybody's got a different kind of story Everybody finds a way to shine But no matter what you got Not alot So what They have theirs and you have yours and I have mine And together we'll be fine We got Diff'rent Strokes to rule the world yes we do we got Diff'rent Strokes to rule the world! ...mmmmm....

      I love the summer before the Olympics because all of the fun sports events are on!  Screw football and basketball!!!  Baseball is a fun event to attend during the summer- but I am talking about Wimbledon every summer and lovely gymnastics, swimming and diving trials up until the August wonderfulness that is the Olympics.  This may be sexist but I feel like so many women who wouldn't be caught dead watching football, baseball or basketball are VERY into the Olympics.  I don't know what that is all about, but it definitely describes me.  But, let's back up to Wimbledon as I pay homage to all of the hot men that I have watched over the years.  None of them play anymore, sadly, but they still live on in my heart!  First and foremost, Mr. Pete Sampras.  I was OBSESSED for years!  Just ask my parents who were forced to listen to me freak out everytime Pete missed a hit or got a double fault.  This year, my second favorite tennis man retired- Goran Ivanisevic, hot Croatian man who finally won Wimbledon in 2001 after getting beat by many including Pete Sampras (a painful match for me to watch!).  Runners up are Ivan Lendl (old school!) and Patrick Rafter (yum!).  I love them all and will remember them fondly...until some new hot young thing begins to play...hehehe!  Back to the Olympics, I am very excited about them.  I have been watching the Olympic trials for women's gymnastics and I think we are going to take control and be awesome ala 1996 (in Hotlanta!).  Go women's gymnastics and all the hot men on the USA team, I will be all about it in August!

      I know it is Tuesday, but I am finally telling about my weekend.  Friday:  This night consisted of drinking a lot and bar hopping in the hot town of Sherman Oaks with my friend!!!  The Mexican food was yum but the bars were so-so.  But that is okay, because there was drinking involved!!!  We went to dinner, four bars, managed to confuse the valet by taking the keys to the car with us instead of leaving them (haha!)- and all this before passing out around midnight!  woo hoo!  Saturday:  The fun didn't stop woo!- I attended the Playboy Jazz Festival with friends of the family every year.  Actually, this is my second year attending, and I decided to bring my friend who with me to enjoy the festivities.  Despite it being the Playboy Jazz Festival- it is an affair at the Hollywood Bowl (sadly, not the mansion) and it is hosted by Bill Cosby.  It involves listening to jazz and eating and drinking all day long.  I love it!!!  If you have binoculars or are in really good seats then you can see Hugh and his lovely(?)ladies enjoying the festivities.  My friend and I started the margaritas around 12.30 and we met a bunch of people who are older than us and nice little married couples (bleh!) but they were quite entertaining when they started the drinking.  And they had food...which always wins in my book!  We left the Jazz festival early to hang out with another friend and go to a party at the Crescent Hotel (again!).  This is where, as I mentioned in an earlier post, the hot manager guy is.  I learned that his name is David and that he is willing to have babies with me!  Or at least that he is willing to make a drink for me and to tell me to come inside because of an LA county ordinance.  LOVE!  I know it!  The night ended with my friends and I scarfing down food (mmm potato skins!) at the formerly ghetto Jerry's on Beverly.   Jerry's used to be very ghetto on late weekend nights- I once went there with friends, one of which was a small drunk Asian British girl who liked yelling that she was 'ghetto fabulous' to all of the people around.  I think they just didn't understand her, therefore we didn't die!  But a fight ensued behind her so we came close...later in the year we learned that Jerry's got the smackdown because someone got shot there.  But it is all good now!  yum!

      So, I thought I would be good at the blog stuff because I love telling lots of random stories.  But, now I realize that my stories are much funnier (at least to myself) when I tell them out loud and with the random jumping around and silly faces I like to make.  I wish I could make random faces on this thing, but I can't- damn technology!  Karen!  You should get a blog because you have a million stories!!!

      So, I am totally freaked out by this whole blogging thing- I don't know what to say!!!  Zuhair helped nothing by being completely obnoxious about what I had already written!  Thanks a lot Zuhair!!!  I am using this opportunity to tell you to go back to where you came from!!! (This is a joke other readers, if there are any!  Minorities can bond like this, and no one likes his kind anyway anymore, they are so last decade!).  I don't plan to be political or to have fabulous things to say, just my observations on my own life and the general world around me!!!  I will keep friends out of it unless they do something very funny!!! wheee!!  On the hot men front: For any LA people who are reading this- go to the Crescent Hotel and check out the hottie manager there, yum!!! but he is mine!  you can drool but don't touch!  On the relationship front:  I have now realized, through mine and my friends' recent experiences, that women 25 and up have hit that time where they switch from dumping boys to being dumped.  What is up with that!! I dumped many a boy in my time with no second thoughts, and now I am getting the royal workover, who do these guys think they are?? I went to Wellesley dammit, I will own all of you measly boys one day!!  Thank you and good day!

      If you are reading this, you might wonder why part of the title is 'the misadventures' (I take it, if you know me, you know why it is called Action Jackson!!!).  Well, in order to thwart the impending quarter life crisis that I and most of my friends could embark on in the next months or years- I am starting this blog to make fun of my future activities.  As of now, I am looking for a new job and a new man- the latter activity alone could provide hilarity!!!!  Success of either could help with the mountain of college and grad school debt that is hovering over me like a mosquito in an Atlantan summer.  SO- the misadventures begin!  If you can help out with any of my activities- let me know, save me from the embarrassment of it all!!!   To get things going, my all knowing mother decided that she would make some demands of me today that involve my goals (paying debt, finding man, finding job!).  The demand: Join the Alumnae Associations of your schools.  Not a bad idea I thought- I paid lots of money and studied sort of hard for these diplomas and now I must bleed the alumnae associations for all they are worth.  So, as of tonight, I have sent out multiple emails to Wellesley and LSE and I have even joined the Ivy/Seven Sisters Singles group.  Yeah, fun with Ivy leaguers...let the games begin...

      This new show, Amish in the City, is my new favorite reality show!!!  I am officially addicted.  It is about 5 Amish kids during the time that all Amish teenagers have to decide if they want to be Amish for the rest of their lives (rumspringa).  And they live with 6 'city' kids.  The city kids were so rude at first because they thought it would be hook up and party central until they met the Amish kids.  So embarrassing for all us city kids to see.  But they all, for the most part, get along now- I am sure normal Real World type drama will come soon enough!    But, for any of you who may have watched the show, I have to say that the guy, Randy I think, is the biggest waste of a hot body I have ever seen. When he doesn't talk or anything, he is SO hot.  Then he opens his mouth and his grill is JACKED and then he talks, seriously, like a high pitched girl.  WHYYYYYYY!!!!! So sad!  Check it out!

      Okay y'all- my project for the last few weeks was to figure out my finances.  I have learned a bit, many of you might already know a lot, but if you don't- I suggest you figure out you bizness now!  I am poor now and don't want to be poor later!!!    What I learned:  1. Save the first hour of your salary every day and put it into a mutual fund.  2. Open up a Roth IRA for retirement purposes.  3. Be involved in investing said mutual fund and make it grow!!  This is a public service announcement brought to you by the letters- A and J and by the company "Make lot of money so I can visit your ass in exotic places, Inc."  No seriously, I don't want any of us to be broke and old- that would be horrible- and on another related note- during this election year we should get more involved in what is going on with our generation because the incumbent and candidate won't really care about us unless we make our voices heard.  We are too young to be apathetic!   Plus we are getting royally screwed as of now!  No social security for us, a huge national debt and having to deal with the old baby boomers!  Take it to the head!  Get involved but at the very least, we must all vote.  Except for you, Mambo, you don't get to play- you're Canadian!

      I felt the need to have a hit counter on my blog because I can kind of tell if people are checking it out or if I am just talking to myself.  I often talk to myself so it wouldn't be a horrible thing.  But what seems to be the worst is a few hits as opposed to none at all.  Is everyone reading once and then saying 'this shit is lame' and then moves on to the tried and true blogs of Wonkette and Gawker???  It make me sad...so I need some help from the few who read.  Pad my hit counter kids, stuff my ballot so to speak!  I need to live in a bubble in which people check my blog a lot so I don't feel unloved!  You  may call it low self-esteem, I call it continuing my dream world...refresh people refresh my blog again and again!  ...or maybe I should just take it off...thoughts???

      I have decided to start a new reason for posting on my blog- my mom and her random thoughts.  This will be an every once in awhile addition to the fun- enjoy!  This time, I am going to start with an oldie but goodie.  It makes me laugh everytime I think about it.  Imagine it with a little southern twang.  (warning: this may only be funny to me, I will provide funnier ones as time goes on!)  Me: Oh sad, I heard on the radio that a coyote ate a daschund!!!  Mom:  It must of thought it was a hot dawg!  ha!

      So, one of my good friends has left the lovely environs of LA.  That leaves me with about 2 close friends left in LA.  Down from 20 or so friends that I had from my grad school program and from back in the day.  This is a very sad state of events!!!  One of my two friends says that LA is very transient and that people come and go often here.  I agree...So I will probably be leaving town as well.  We shall see...  But why do I only have two friends left in LA you may ask!!?!?!  Both of which I knew before I got here???  I am not THAT weird, I know how to make friends...I promise...but I have decided that west coast people and east coast/southern people are very different.  To the point that I can actually lump east coast and southern people together because these usually different groups are one and the same when comparing to the west coast.  They ask the same questions...Why do these west coast people stay on the west coast and never leave?  Why are everyone's boobs also used for flotation devices?  Why are Uggs at all stylish when the weather doesn't drop below 70?  Why is the weather so eerily nice but the people aren't?  Why do people surf in the cold ass Pacific to almost get eaten by sharks?  okay, enough with the questions.  But seriously, I cannot seem to get on the same wavelength as the folks here- even at the most fun world of where I work.  Lest you think I am crazy, many of my friends who have left town and the ones (2) that are still here feel the same way.  It is an odd odd land of the west.  So, I figure I will go to NYC where they may be odd as well, but at least they are the east coast kind of odd.  That I can deal with.

      Did anyone see the Wedding show yesterday on ABC, I think???  For all my Wellesley friends, do y'all remember Christine(a?) Hrul???  I remember chrul from the message boards- anyway she was on this show because she randomly decided to marry her HLS boy in Prague in a castle.  And she showed some Bridezilla style that I am sure other Wellesley women will show in the future.  But I was very annoyed because they said she was from Wesleyan- but I think she went to grad school there or something...but you never know.  The Wellesley/Wesleyan mix-up may have lived on in tv land!   My past weekend was marred by a SERIOUS hang over from Friday's activities (the drinking tales continue!)-  I couldn't eat or drink until 9pm on Saturday.  That ain't right.  The night included almost getting thrown out of a bar, someone falling, and someone waking up with vomit on one side of the bed and themselves on the other side of the bed.  I won't tell who did what- but it was a rough night had by all!!!

      Well, the weekend held quite a few surprises for my friend, shermain from the sherm, and I. On Friday we went to see The Manchurian Candidate, a lovely little movie with Denzel in it. It was a good movie but there were some random/disturbing parts that came up throughout the film. One of which involves Denzel biting the crap out of someone, ala Mike Tyson. Despite that, and a few other crazy actions, Manchurian was pretty good!  Saturday night, after some vegetarian grub and a failed attempt at getting our palms read, we went to check out a party posted on a Yahoo online group called 'LA Fun'. Joining this online group was our attempt to connect with our west coast peeps. And connect we did....with one person...who has the same name as my ex which I promptly pushed out of my head to give him a fair chance. This party was supposed to be pretty big, but we only met this one guy- but he was a bit of a party himself- he ran around the bar trying to find other 'LA Fun Clubbers' and when he determined there were no more, he told us many, many stories. Stories that involved his friend punching his wife in the stomach and about his job as a satellite technician for the air force with an incomprehensible work schedule that boggled the mind...he entertained us for an hour and then we got free...only to have my ass grabbed while trying to get into shermain's car!!! Ahh Venice...what fun!!!  So, while we didn't get attacked by a serial killer or get punched in the stomach, it puts into question these online activities. Do you really find normal people through them??? The guy we met, I will call him by his Indonesian name, budi, was okay but odd. And what about online dating??? I have friends who have done this, but it hasn't turned out so well...short guys and uggers galore! Any online success stories?? Whether it be friends you meet or dates??

I haven't seen it and I really wanted to, but I am hearing bad things...tell me!!!  I am very upset with M. Night because he has yet to live up to the Sixth Sense...I need a quality scary movie!...anyone up for Alien vs. Predator??? hehe....

      I was driving around running some errands and a Creed song came on, I think it is called 'Higher' - I know, I know, insert collective groan here...at first I was laughing and joking around that Creed was over- they are kinda freaks, at least Scott Stapp- but hey, if someone with a ridiculous Jesus-complex wants to take me higher, where blind men see...then hey, why not!
