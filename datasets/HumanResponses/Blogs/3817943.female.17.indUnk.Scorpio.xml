       DaY 1  . . .  &nbsp; Jess and I desided that we would make pancakes for breakfast at Jess's house before camp and then I would drive to camp. When we got there we were suprised that more girls didn't show up.&nbsp; It was really funny when the first game we played was the one that is like that buddy tag kinda . . . you stand still with a buddy but if someone comes and latches on to the other side of your buddy then you have to take off runnin . . . anyway, no one could get the concept!! It was kinda frustrating. Learned alot today and Im excited to go back . . .    DaY 2  . . .  &nbsp; This mornin Jess came to my house and I had blueberry muffins waitin for. I already had a pain in my inerthighs before I went to camp but damn . . . did they hurt after but Im gonna be a beast if I keep up with these damn push ups I keep havin to do.&nbsp; We did alot more runnin today and I have now realized how out of shape I am.&nbsp; Anyway . . . I learned even more today and I really think my game is getting alot stronger.&nbsp; I just have really got to start pushin myself more. Anyway . . . Jess, Finney, Nick, and I all went to&nbsp;lunner together at Panara breads and it was real good. After that even though I was real sore . . . . I went and played trash lax with Finney and alot of coaches.&nbsp; It was real fun cuz there were no rules and I got to play on both teams. Anywho I really got to soak my body in a hott bath . . .Peace!   DaY 3  . . . &nbsp; Today was the most fun! We got to do this real cool drill . . . basically we had no sticks and we ran and tryed to get away from two defenders that were practicing double teaming. We were aloud to do anything we wanted to keep the ofence from getting past but hit them in the face.&nbsp; At one point Dannelle got carried away and didn't want Jess to get by so she tackled her to the ground! It was soOo funny! After that, the coaches started watching us cuz we got more and more fisical with each other! It was real fun. I gots me some minore bruses. Oh well . . . i have to take another hot bath and rest up for tomorrows scrimages!    DaY 4  . . .  &nbsp;&nbsp; Today was all about the scrimaging. We warmed up of course and we played buddy tag agian but this time we had to lay on the ground. Jess and I picked a stritigic location so we wouldn't get picked but of course that didn't last but 2 seconds. I was off and runnin and I desided to get creative by sliding, rollin, and stumbling into saftey on the ground. Lol! It was fun. Then when the fastest shot contest came around Julie (from Centenial) won with a shot of 59 miles per hour! Thats real fast for a girl fyi! Anyway, we also had a drawing for a free harrow shaft(which is $85) and I won! I already have one too so if it breaks&nbsp; . . . i have a back up! My team did real good on the scrimages. We won the first two games but lost the last. Over all I really liked that camp. I also need to work my way to a 6 min. mile!! Now that is gonna take workin on! Peace out!

      Ok . . . everything started out normal . . . I met Bri and Finney at Sonic. Did ya know that you could get free refills at sonic?!? Well ya can! Anywho, we started readin my cup and they have strange drinks like . . . orange rootbeer and chocolate cherry coke . . . . lets just say EWWWW!! Jess met us there like and hour later and she ordered a corndog, who the fuck orders a corndog at sonic?!? Anyway . . . we sat there for like another hour until Jess whips out her Brusters cards and we go there. While were eatin we see this lingerie mart, we were like hell why not!. So we all go over there and walk in the door and it was like a fuckin warehouse for strippers!! We kept gettin real nasty looks from this dude that worked there but hell . . we were entertained! Then Jess desides that she wanted to buy dan the perfect gift . . . . a man thong! Then she was wanting to know how much bulk cuz it was 2 bucks cheeper . . . damn that lady was mean when Jess asked . ."You dont qualify, its 150 pairs!". . .&nbsp; i think we really pissed off the workers cuz we kept laughin at alot of the shit they were carring. When Jess went to buy the thong 4 dan the lady was like "do you know this is a man's thong" . . .lol . . . Then we get back to all our cars and then jess desides to try on the man thong!! She started shovin objects into the pouch! Then they found my window pen&nbsp; . . . then more crazyness begins with Finney, Bri, and Jess writin all over Finney's and Jess's car! Stuff like "Jess wears man thongs" and " I have small ta-tas" real random shit. Then we deside to go chill at Jess's house for a bit while she got ready. Then off to Finney's house I went & I just chilled some more. When i got back home . . . something just came over me and I had to wash my car, at 10:30pm I was outside washin my car &amp; talkin to Finney on the phone. Multi-taskin!! Just another random ass day for da Finney Car Crew!! PeAcE oUt!!

First day I was there, me and my uncle ran around the golf course in a cart goin group to group just makin fun of how they played. My mom and my aunt ran the beer cart . . . now this was funny. . . they were so fuckin slow that me and my uncle had to find them and deliver beers to groups cuz they were needin "rehydration" . . .&nbsp; anyway, my cuz , Jeff, started buyin beer for me, so of course we are not gonna let that go to waste. By the time we were done I had about 6 beers in me and we were goin back to the family farm house.&nbsp; When we got back Jeff and I desided that we were goin explorin on the 4 weelers . . .&nbsp; then i got to my bed and passed out!   Second day . . .&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The was the big day . . . everyone was comin to the farm for the family reuion.&nbsp; I have 4 cuz's that im real tight to . . . Jeff, Ryan, and the twins Matt&nbsp;& Greg. . .&nbsp;these are my alchole suppliers. First Jeff, it starts me at like noon with a margarita and I had to keep havin Ryan holdin on to it for me, the fucker drank half of it but I was soon givin another drink of Mountain Dew and vodka . . . this was less noticeable cuz it looked like dew and my inicent cuz matt gave it to me. My mom started catchin on when i started showin alittle after like my 5th drink they gave me but she couldn't point out witch of my 17364849463 million cuz's gave it to me so she just blew it off. Then me madree got alot drunker before me so after that was all said and done i didn't have to hide it anymore cuz my pops was completly fine with it.&nbsp; I cant remember all the details but i think my camra and my cuz's filled me in quite alot. . . .im out . .

      Last night was so much fun! First the rents were out of town for the night so I decided to invite Jess and Finney over to spend the night. Finney got to my house arond like 8:30 and we desided to visit Jess at work since she wasn't pickin up her phone. We ended up stayin until like 9:45 but it was fun talkin to Page. I desided I would be Santa Clause that night for Jess and bring her an asortment of goodies! The we all went to Jess's house to meet up with da boys and go swimming . . . that lasted all but 30 min. Then the girls headed to my house. We were just chillin, takin showers, and eating. Then Grant & Sean show up . . . this is when the madness begins! First I deside that Im gonna wip out the Triple Sec from my dad's liqure cabnet. We start to drink and&nbsp;then all types of confusion started happening....i dont even know what went on but grant and sean were hiding from Dan and Kevin cuz they wanted to party and Dan and Kevin didnt or something like that...it turned into people running around Nikkii's house, Jess disappearing half the time and me and Nikkii just REALLY confused... it turned out that Jess was actually playing a lil game and she was "lying" to Nikkii and I and Dan and her had this whole thing planned..anyways ALOT of confusion belive me.&nbsp; Grant and Sean ended up sleepin at my house and we watched Forest Gump, well kinda, we all passed out like 15min into the movie, probly cuz it was 5am.&nbsp; Any way I wake up at like 8 to wake up Sean to go to church and he was already gone.&nbsp; I wake up again at like 10 to wake up Grant and he is already awake and waitin for me to move my car. I went back to sleep and woke up with da girls and we went Parson's for Jess and Finn to get something but they we're closed, so we went to Fudruckers and won us a t-shirt by winnin the trivia question . . .&nbsp; with the help of da boys.  Bri, Finney, and I got our supplies for the cookout at summer league. . . . it was real organized! We had fun playin and then ate some good food . . . mind the first couple burgers that Hart and Bri cooked. It was a real interestin weekend . . . Peace out!

      Today was one of those random days. First I get woken up by Jess at about 9 this mornin just to hear her idea of getin a truck and hallin a lacrosse goal up to South to play lacrosse . . . random! Later my mom and I desided that we wanted to see the movie Sleepover. It was real cheesey. After that I talked to the Finnster and she invited me to eat dinner with Bri, Woodis, and her but I had to wear jeans and a polo shirt. That kinda freaked me out cuz that ment we were eatin somewhere nice. Well, Finney and I get to Woodis's house and it turns out they matched! It was funny. But to top that off . . . Bri and I matched as well. It was even funnier when we all ordered the same thing from Dennis our crazy waiter. Then we all gots us sum Brusters . . . um um good . . . and chilled at Finney's for a bit until I took Bri home. I desided to be creative and take a new way home but being that it was me, it wasn't that simple. I get fuckin lost!! Well I finally found my way home after 15min of detours and Im goin to bed! PEACE!

          The past two days have been real cool. First, yesterday . . .         I told Bri that I would pick her up around 11 so of course i dont get there until like 11:30. So I get Bri, but nothing is that simple for us.  Bri gets into the car and Im like "You hungry?" and she was like "Im starving!" So I was like "Sonic is a must then!" So we start driving toward Sonic and it was like 9 zillion miles away but when we got there we thought the damn speaker was broken cuz I kept pushin and pushin it and no one came on it. Then I go to move the Jeep to another spot and the mother fucker starts talkin to me. So we get everyone drinks and us food and start going toward Finneys house . . . but once again, not that simple. We get majorly lost and I deside to take a turn and we find where we are and get ourselves onto Holcome Bridge road (the road Finneys house is on) but of course we turn on to 400 South thinkin we needed to go one more exit and by the time we figured that it was what we wanted it was too late. Eventually we did get to Finneys pool, just to find out everyone had letter stickers on them selves tanin words onto 'em. Finney had her number (7) on her lower back along with Finney spelt out on her butt . . Catherine had kitty spelt out on her lower back . . . Hart had Hanson spelt out on her lower back . . . Woodis had Woody on her butt and her number (18) on her lower back. Anyway, we stay at the pool for awhile until everyone was hungery . . . so we went to Moe's! (We're Closed!! stupid asses) We all had a nice calm lunch with food throwing, chips down shirts, salt in drinks, and welcoming customers. It was at lunch that we came up with the brilliant idea of the "7th of July Party" It consisted of 7 people, gatering on the 7th day of the 7th month.But on the way home Bri desides that she is gonna throw her gum at Harts car . . . it lands smack dab in the middle of the windsheild, so now it turns into a game. The 7th was fun . . . and organized! We had a cook out(jess almost burnt her eyebrows off tryin to light the grill), found out Jess had a hidden talent (Bri was spitting skittles out of her mouth and Jess was catching them with her boobs) but then Woodis had to leave. . . so we all pilled into Finneys car to take her home and we were singing backstreet boys, N'sync, aqua you know old school shit. When we got back we had fun with fireworks . . . we had sprinkler fights and lit these thinks called strobe light fireworks and those were the best. Then we went inside and made a bed in the middle of the living room (even though all beds were open) and watched Forest . . Forest Gump.              Now for the Six Flags adventure . . . .          I wake up around like 4 to Sadie(Jess's puppy) trying to burry under my arms but go back to sleep with her around my head. 8:30 rolls around and everyone is up. We sit talkin for awhile and then deside that we need to go get our Six Flags tickets . . along with some Red Bull and food. On our way to Six Flags we find out someone's lost their fuckin house . . . where do you live? oh on 141 - you cant miss it!--  it had fallen of the back of a damn truck!! (picturing someone standing in a driveway) where the hell is my house?? it was supposed to be here hours ago!We get to Six Flags and have a 1/2 mile hike to the gates (but parking was only $3). On all the rides we had perfect timing . . . on Superman we had to wait like 45 min but that was cuz it was having "technical difficulties" but we made sure our wait counted as two rides back to back. Six Flags was real fun though. We were real smart about leavin the park to eat. We took like a 2 hour lunch brake with only 10sec of eating and the rest playin some trivia game. Then we get to see this lame diving show and Bri, Finney, and I all get soaked . . . but Bri got it twice as bad cuz she got the spit water also (umm umm umm) Then we get back to Jess's house and we all have to pee . . . but Bri has used all the toliet paper in 2 bathrooms! Dan calls and is like " We (meanin the boys that ditched us for White Water) are eating dinner" then Jess is like we should all go eat . . . so by golly we went and ate at JR's. After that we all knew we were tired cuz everything was funny now and Jess had to throw up. That was the whole day in a nutshell believe it . . or not!  QuOtEs/random actions:  *That damn Bug full of little princesses! Dont let them pass!! *BRI RUN!!! IF THERES ONE THING I HATE IN MY LIFE ITS CUTTERS!!!  *olympic trivia game! *the color game - im just gonna make a color and call it fuck, see the color of that chair thats called fuck *hey do you want your ticket stub? *how do you spell real? *COcumber salad, what the hell is a cocumber anyway? *I WISH I COULD PUT THIS DAY IN A BOX AND LIVE IT OVER AND OVER!

      The fourth of July was crazy! First I had to fuckin work again but it was only until 7 this time. But once again I took a shower and then went to get Bri.  We went over to Jess's house about 8:45 or 9 and when we pulled up we heard firecrackers already goin of in the back. Jess made Dan wait for the sun to go down before he could have fun shooting off more fireworks. We got to climb up to the top of the roof on Jess's house to watch the fireworks! Watching people try to get down was the funniest thing ever. Nicki in a skirt, Grant being a big baby, and Jess just runnin down the thing. After that we waited about 2 hours to start drinkin cuz Grants girlfriend was suppose to be comin but her mom was drivin so we thought we should wait until she got to Jess's. Then finally she calls grant and she aint comin . . . . so let the party begin! Kevin made some drink that is like 1 can of lemonade, 2 beers, and 8 shots of rum/vodka . . . at least I think that is the recipe. Oh well, after the drink was made things got a little crazy.  People started dancin, playin capture the flag with charlie. . . . who the fuck is charlie?!?!, jess's nose got drunk, and ricky getin a little over his head. Then around three we went upstairs to watch some Tv. It took us about an hour just to figure out the romote but we finnaly did and watched some crazy shit on MTV. After like 2 min of that shit Dan and Jess went to bed. Then Grant wanted to go to bed so I showed him where ansley's room was, and in like 40 sec everyone else was up in Ansley's room. We had 3 people in the bed and 2 on the ground. Kelly and Grant slept on the ground but soon retreated to the basement when me, chris, and bri wouldn't shut up. I got a total of about 1 hour maybe of sleep until i had to wake up and go to work. Fun shit that was! Well i worked til 2 and then went home to sleep. Fell asleep at about 3 and was wokin up at like 7 by me madre cuz she said i needed to stay awake for a while before i went back to sleep. Well i watched CSI:Miami and then went to bed until 11 this mornin. Damn I feel good!

      I worked all day today! 6:45 - 4!! Anyway . . . i got home showered and went to pick up Bri, this is when the madness begins.  First I was wearing jeans and a Holister shirt, then when we got back to my house I was like " Its too fuckin hot outside to be wearin jeans!" So I changed into my navy boyshorts (litterally boy's shorts) but I couldn't find a shirt to go with it, so i consulted my fashion cordinater . . . My Sister! She came up with like 5 shirts to choose from and I had a little fashion show for about 30 min. until I desided to just go with Lacrosse shorts and a t-shirt. Then Bri and I watched some of a movie on Tv until we met up with Hart, Courtney, & some other people from Hart's church to see Spiderman II but we couldn't find a damn parkin spot anywhere near the theature so we parked 3 from the back.  When we went into the theature some guy came out of fuckin no where and scared Bri & I. But we all got the best seats in the house . . . front row, well almost front row. After we sat down Bri & I desided we wanted some candy. So when we got to the counter we saw this sign that if you get a large popcorn and 2 large drinks you get a free candy. We end up gettin this big ass bowl of popcorn! You should have seen it . . . it had to be the size of a toilet bowl! Have no fear, Bri & I were able to concer the entire bowl with the help of Courney snaggin a few handfuls that is. The movie was quite entertaining to Bri & I though, think of the following phrases and think of what first comes to your mind: " You cant get of if your never on" "Mary Jane"  Well anyway, Bri & I have demed ourselves the 2 stooges, we just need to find a third. Oh well, hey Bri . . . Go Get 'em Tiger!!
