      Well my first week or half a week of school is over.  Yay!  It has been fun, today there was a GC in the senior lounge and I played SSB like all day long.  The homework load is light, but it will get bigger.  And my classes are nice, so for now I have nothing to complain about.  Picked up the Kill Bill 2 DVD and there is this deleted scene, from which like 1 second of it was shown in the trailer and it is sooo awesome.  Bill kills these five guys with relative ease.  The due date for all films wanting to be in Indie Memphis is in like 4 weeks from now.  Time to get working!! Well, I dont really have all that much to post about. Oh! I am taking my driver's test again this Tuesday, and guess what I'm studying for it. Until next time.

      Okay,okay so the first day of my senior year was pretty cool and all, but when I got home from school I still had a paper and two essays to write.  Man did I write my ass off.  I guess its something about knowing you're gonna get killed if the essays dont get finished by tomorrow that helps you shit papers out faster.  Well, I gotta go to school now.  But I was so happy that i finished writing last nite (this morning) that I could have sworn the Super Smash Bros. guy came out of no where and said "congradulations!" Until next time

      I am writing this from the parking lot of the school uniform place, my mom is inside getting uniforms for my sister.  So today I went to the DMV, y’know I still need to get my permit.  I bet you can guess how this turned out, thanks to my convenient title.  Yeah, for the second time I failed my driver’s test.  What a boost in self-confidence when you can’t pass a test that Billy-Bob, who is picking his ass in between questions, aces.  God, it sucks.  I mean, I wasn’t up for the whole wait three hours in line thing, I even knew I wasn’t going to pass, so what ends up happening?  I don’t pass.  Boy is my mom pissed.  She can’t stop mumbling under her breath about it, “my son has a genius IQ, made a 30 on his ACT, AND CAN’T PASS THE FUCKING DRIVER’S TEST”.   Sorry for the language, but this day has sucked total balls.  When my mom gets back to the car, we still have to go to the Apple store, iPod is broken, then to Office Max for school supplies.  There’s another thing that sucks, school starts tomorrow.  Okay, I’ve taken my six quizzes, written my two poems….and haven’t even started my two essays and two papers.  I’m really not linking myself today.  Sure some can say its my fault for not passing the test.  “Philip, the only time you studied was today!”  While that may be true, it doesn’t matter.  I’m taking the test next week and the week after and after.  Im going to pass that test UNDER ten tries.   A soulution:  well, my mom has said that she is sending me to driver’s ed.  I may be wrong, but don’t you need at least a permit for driver’s ed.  All the people who I know that took the course all had their permits.  Now for this to work, it would mean no TKDo, like ever, b/c my mom would have to drive me to driver’s ed.  This is simply unacceptable.  TKDo is the only thing that keeps me alive, that keeps me going, if I didn’t have it then I could stop my existence or move to Nashville, both of which I don’t want to do.  See?  I told you things would get interesting, even if you may think I am a pathetic being.  Well, I got a lot of things to think about and even more papers than that to write, so I shall take my leave. Until next time.

      Okay, so after this post you may hate me and think I am a terrible person, but oh well, I need to vent. Alright so about 10 minutes ago I walk downstairs. I'm kinda hungry, haven't eaten much all day besides a hamburger and have been writing essays for the better half of the day.  I walk downstairs and my little sister is watching TV while doing her homework, there is a rule at my house that says "no TV while doing homework." I polietly ask her to turn the television off; she refuses.  I turn it off and tell her she needs to concentrate on her homework.  She then yells at the top of her lungs, "BUT I HAVE TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS FOR SCHOOL!!!" Okay, she was watching cartoons on Disney, she didn't even know what channel the Olympics were on anyway. I tell her that she can sit at the table (she was on a chair/couch watching TV), do her homework, stop throwing all the candy wrapper from whence she was eating candy in the chair and that she can turn on the TV when she is supposed to watch the Olympics.  Here's where it gets crazy.  She gets up and screams.  Followed by tears, running around and complaints that I don't understand her.  After about 3 minutes of me talking to her screaming I get fed up and yell at her.  I say that while mom is at work I am left in charge and that she should know better than to disobey mom's rules when she is not home.  After I say that I move my sister's homework and books to the table where she can get to work.  Wow, does she hate this.  Once more she screams and declares that she hates me and wants to kick me in the balls.  I say "fine, go ahead, if you can."  She gets up off the floor and charges me.  When she gets close enough I sidestep and grab her from behind when she passes me.  She screams and I ask her to calm down.  Her breathing slows, she quiets down, things start to go in my favor.  THEN SHE DECIDES SHE WANTS TO BACK KICK ME IN THE NUTS. Great move sis.  When her foot moves I catch it inbetween my legs, just below my manhood.  Her ankle is trapped, that must have hurt.  Now I am seriously fed up with this little girl and her psycho problems.  I turn her around and lower my voice, calmly I tell her to get back to work and stop complaining.  When I let go of her she takes a few steps and slips on her socks, great she hit her head.  Don't worry, she was fine.  But she didn't think so.  Now I have a crazy girl running around complaining that my brother and I are yelling at her when we are barely speaking over a whisper.  God, I am so sick of her.  I call my mom, she tells me that she has ordered pizza for us and asks how everyone is doing, I explain the situation.  I get my sister to pick up another phone and mom tells her no TV is allowed while she does her homework, my sister says "okay" and everything is fine.  WTF??? So now I have a mom that thinks I did the right thing, but yelled at my sister too much, I yelled like once compaired to my sister's million yells.  A brother that thinks I'm a meanie head because I didn't want to look at some internet cartoon while I was writing this post and a sister that hates my guts and wants me dead.  Anyone else have problems like this?

      Well, school starts in two days and besides Friday this weekended couldn't have been more boring.  I will start off by saying I did almost absolutley(sp?) nothing.  Seem interesting? Too bad, I won't elaborate.  Right now I'm waiting for Spiku to pick me up for some school service hours.  While at school I'll probably to something, I mean they are not going to give me service hours for nothing.  Oh, and I have to pick up my school laptop.  I get to use Windows again, yay! ¬.¬   Well I best be ending this short blog post about nothing in particular.  Until next time.

      Alright so today I wake up to take a shower and already have Leethar in my neighborhood.  We then rush to school for this "new student greeting" thing, kinda pointless for me but it was fun.  I met up with a dude I shall call Shaggy and after the school thing the three of us ran by my house to pick up Alien and then went to Leethar's.  For the better part of the day we had an AvP2 LAN Party...among three people.  We each took turned owning each other and has a lot of fun.  We took two breaks, one to watch Predator and the other to watch Alien, duh.  Then around 7PM we three headed to the Paradiso, they went to hold seats and I went to play DDR.  Umm, Blackdog, you never told us what movie you went to go see.  Jeez, I thought you knew, we wnt to go see AvP.  Also Alakai, Wayland and El Taco were there.  Just to tell you all, the movie roxored!!!1one  After the movie I met up with my brother and his girlfriend who weren't allowed in the movie because it was sold out. So sad for them.  After the movie more AvP2 ownage continued until Shaggy left and the games slowed down.  Then  the History Channel was turned on and a program on sniping was on. Then I decided to blog.  So I did.  I'm really tired and should probably stop now.  Okay, okay I'm stopping. Until next time.

      Alright, the forum is STILL down.  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  In other news I went to school for a couple hours today. Attended a laptop training program, me in a laptop training program, yeah I know.  It was sooo boring, sitting there with like 50 some odd 7th graders watching them trying to get their IBMs working.  Afterwards my mom was convinced I needed some nice clothes for school and went on a shopping spree at Dillard's.  I, on the other hand, was convinced I needed Alien vs. Predator 2 for Mac, so I stopped by the Apple store and picked it up.  I also learned that instead of wasting time shipping off my messed up iPod to California, I can just bring it to the store and they will fix it.  Cool, huh?  After setting up the game I had to go to Taekwondo.  It was fun, the kickboxing was normal, then I tought some n00bs who showed up that day, then my mom handed be control of the color belts (and one black belt).  Hehehehe, this was fun.  I started by showing them a neat kick combo, then did speed kick drills.  Push-ups inbetween the kick rotations, of course.  Then RIGHT before class ended, when everyone was complaining that they were tired I had them do machine gun kicks up and down the floor. I have so much fun when I teach. On a serious note, I should have given Brittany, Walker and Ricky more push-ups to do, they always act up in class. I made a mental note to not let it happen again.  Thats the problem with working out at the YMCA, people forget that we are in class b/c we're not in a dojhang. Friday is gonna be awesome though.  I have to wake up early, Leethar is picking me up and brining me to a school thing, then we head to his house for an AvP2 LAN party, then to top it all off, we have tickets for Alien vs. Predator at the Paradiso, on the really BIG screen.  Hopefully some people from the forum will show up.  Well, I actually got to go get some sleep now, got to wake up WAY too early. Until next time.  PS- I picked up the awesome manga called Sgt. Frog, everyone should go buy a copy!

      Okay, so today starts like anyother normal day. I get up around noon, take a piss, take my "sleep" away message off and, whats this? Semisomnus.com is down??  This can't be right.  I refresh about eighty million times, but to no avail the site is down.  Today has been one of the weirdest days of the summer.  I am addicting to the forum and I couldn't believe that I wasn't on it. Some how I've managed. Dinner last night was fun.  Me, my sister, my mom, Master Yasay and his two daughters all went to eat at Houston's.  My brother didn't make it.  Holy crap did he get his ass chewed by mom. The rest of the night was uneventful, I played some COD and modded on the forum.  Today was interesting alright.  After giving up on Semisomnus.com, I donned my Taekwondo pants, grabbed a t-shirt and went to go work out in the garage.  After about 45min of punching bags and such I get a call from Taylor.  It seems him and Mikey are at Border's, I tell them to pick up Initial D 13 then come over to my house so we can duel.  No not sword fighting, they are not martial artists.  We played Yu-Gi-Oh.  Thats right a bunch of high school seniors played Yu-Gi-Oh.  I don't see the big deal, Yugi is in 10th grade after all. Great, now you're all thinking, "God, Blackdog is such a dork". Oh, well.  After they left my Tanchan went to football practice, he's the manager, and Leethar informed me he bought the tix for AvP. Yay!! Tomorrow I have to go to school and take a laptop training for my school IBM, ewww! Im sure you all are tired of reading my long ass posts by now, but I promise when school starts these post will be interesting. Until next time (tomorrow).

      Ok, first off I want to say that this version may differ from the original post.  You see, like a dumbass I closed my browser window mid post. Where to begin?  Okay, instead of flippn back and forth between time Tarantino style, like the first draft I shall try to go in order.  Spiku came over after Alakai left.  Ahh crap, out of order.  Aliright, imagine I told you I got my hair cut short before i told you about the Spiku thing.  Yeah my hair is short now,  kinda creepy.  Anyway Spiku was over and we watched Pride and Predjudice cuz the book was soooo boring.  Then we sparred.  I tried out Olympic Taekwondo moves against his trying to remember what he read about different Kung Fu styles.  It was fun, a good workout.  There were people over for dinner, some family friends and a new guy my mom brought home.  He is nice, old, but nice.  The evening was uneventful, but then the clock stuck midnight. At that moment creativity hit Spiku and I like a bokken in the hands of Musashi.  We started spitting out ideas for a new script left and right, it was really cool.  Then my crimestopper friend had some problems with her blog so I helped out there.  I will put up a link when I can.  Anyways, after that all hell broke loose.  Crimestopper and I were bombarded with angry people IMing us, and then it kinda died down.  It was weird.  But I have recieved a death match Marvel vs. Capcom 2 from a Canadian.  Sounds interesting, no?  So thats all that happened in the AM of today.  For the rest of the day, after my five hours of sleep I plan to do nothing.  Cool, huh? No, I might play that Canadian and I have to go out for dinner tonite with my Taekwondo master and his family. Talk to everyone later.

      Wow, This is an accomplishment in its own, I have been up a day online.  Not to mention the fact that I have not slept since the last post, which I believe was some 12 hrs ago.  Whee!  Time just flies when you happen to be doing mindless crap on the internet.  My mood right now is kinda at a state where I feel great, but will crash after I type this.  So I got this blog linked on Semisomnus, if you haven't been there... WWW.SEMISOMNUS.COM There ya go ^_^  4|\|1m3 F4c3!!! So here I am, with my trusty Alakai by my side, surfing the net from like 9pm-6am.  Here is what went down: -Voicechatted with Crimestopper #3981 for many hours -Browse Jlist.com, this place has kick ass stuff spent a good time there wishing I had a credit card        Hello Kitty "shoulder massager", anyone??? -Edit Spiku's gay flames on WWW.SEMISOMNUS.COM -Ramen and Waffles. -Had breakfast (see previous) -Wow, it seems like more happened last night, but y'know, I can't seem to remember.
