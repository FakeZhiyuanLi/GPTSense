      What, did AJ tell you about it or something? Just a thought... BTW, did you meet anybody over the summer that you liked? Or possibly even "liked"? I'm just full of thoughts today! Fuck! ......I just stubbed my toe when I tried to stretch out while sitting at the computer. Damn that hurts!!! Anyway, I am not quite back into Oregon yet, but late tomorrow night I will be. I will be free to do anything that I want on the 23rd probably... However, I probably already have plans then so more like the 25th-26th. T2UL8R! (Talk to you later!)  Josh  P.S. the time the message was posted is in Dallas time, so take away two hours to find out when I posted it Oregon time.
