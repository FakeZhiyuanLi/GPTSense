      As you can see...it's pretty late and i am pretty tired. but i just have to get something off my chest before i can rest easy. everyone who went to the show last night...has never seen the strawberries before....well atleast all the south and crossler students.  and ive been telling a few people that they should see the strawberries for a long time and they just skip out on the show. and finally when all the queers get together to see the show its with different band members. it makes me mad because they didnt get to see the original.  but it doesnt matter cuz  you're all cunts.

      Yesterday...it was my dismay to attend probably the most disappointing Strawberries show that I've ever seen. It was at South High School. a bunch of people were there...a bunch of fucking losers. except for chris and brian and tiana of course.  It was so different. Their two new members played really well and were very good...but they just did things...differently.  Like White Limousine. During that song i was expecting one of those crazy solos....but instead i got this....weird complicated solo that doesnt match. and the songs just didnt feel the same. the two new band members really can achieve the sound if they practice...but they dont really have that look. they dont really look like theyre in the strawberries. it saddened me. so i left.  Other bands that also played were The Sultan of Sound, The Falcon, and the Mopps.  The Mopps played last but i didnt stay for them.  The Falcon on the other hand was amazing. As usual.

      I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland.  The night before we played at the Long Goodbye.  I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night.  A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night.  And well...I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this  bright blue pickup drove up.  It had KC lights, tractor tires,everything but the CB.  It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid,...right.  Well...they drove up to me and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell,  "HEY FAGGOT!"  and showered me with some water.  So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock.  Now, I waited, walked down about a block to  ..where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside,  and sure enough they drove around again.  They said, "Hey, faggot! where's the nearest McDonald's?"  I said,"I don't know"  and they squirted me again.  So I threw the rock!  and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car.  They screached to a halt in the parking lot of some department store,  who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer,  and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling,  "We're gonna kill you!, you god damn faggot!, we're gonna kill you!,  you motherfucker!"  So I got in a phonebooth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside,  held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door  to the phonebooth.  So they began charging the phonebooth,  beating on it with their club, yelling,  "We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you,  you god damn faggot."  I just looked at them.  So, there was a crowd gathering by this time  and these kids were standing nearby and they said,  "Oh, look at him, he's insane."  I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out.  I yelled at them, "Take me to a mental hospital right away.  I wanna be be put away.  Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away.  Please put me away now."  They said,  "Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."  So they called the police.  The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks.  He opens up the door, "Get out of there, you!"  throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back.  Then he goes over to the jocks,  "Now what happened here? It looks like we're going have to take him to jail  but we got to have the full story first"  So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole  Yeah, ace in the hole, and they go,  "Well, goddammit,  the motherfucker put a dent in my truck! a $5,000 truck! right,  so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him!  I want to kill him! Let me kill him, goddammit!  Let me kill him!"  So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home,  and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence.  And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerent Oregon?

Oh. and   The Pixies   Concert is soon to come.               Kurt Cobain, who identified "Surfer Rosa" as his favorite album of that entire decade, confessed, when writing "Smells Like Teen Spirit," that, "Basically, I was ripping off The Pixies."               David Bowie called their work "just about the most compelling music of the entire '80s"    Saturday, September 4th 2004 Eugene, Oregon on 6:30PM at the Les Schwab Amphitheater The Pixies will play.   I'm there assholes!

      God..this movie has shown me the light. Bush really is as crooked as everyone say he is. When September 11th happened George Bush sat in a classroom full of kids...not knowing what to do...not being told what to do or where to go...George W. Bush read about goats with children for 7 minutes while our country was being attacked...in the most worst attack to ever happen on American soil....even worse than Pearl Harbor. And who's fault is it? Bush's fault. I STRONGLY recommend seeing this movie.  and once you see this movie you may want to do something about it.

      I am just confused. Women are difficult. If you're in love with them they're difficult to understand. Which means, you really can't tell if they like you, because they do things that you just wouldn't expect. Which also could lead to two things: They like fucking with your mind or They really do like you. But if they did like you they probably wouldn't tell you. Girls do this hinting but not saying thing. You all know what I'm talking about. And it's so frustrating being infatuated with someone and not being able to figure anything out because everytime you communicate with them it's all small talk. You don't really learn anything about each other because you proabably talk about world events or your parents. Sharing your horrible childhood doesn't really turn anyone on either. Making people trying to feel sorry for you won't help anything. IT will just make them look down at you.   Don't fuck around with your feelings. Don't spill them to anyone. NO. Your online journal isn't the place. You want privacy.  Privacy? Privacy is hard to find. I don't keep a private journal...because I know its not really private. I know my mom goes through my room.  But anyways yeah...life is horrible. Fuck you ladies. I am so sick and tired of chasing after you. What's the point? You women just tie me down. I want to be free. So suck my balls ladies. Suck my balls.   and get out of my life.  Diversity...people say everyone is the same...and equal. Equal in what sense? Nobody is the same. If we were we'd all have the same finger prints, the KKK would be the Kool Kids Klub, and Hitler would have been a successful painter. I am not a minority. Fuck you.   I would normally say goodnight but theres nothing good about it.  I have more to talk about but I will continue in the morning.  Until then, au resevoir.....cunts.

      This band is good. With Ryan Neighbors (Formerly of The Vidiots), Matt Moore(Formerly of The Vidiots and The Strawberries), and Kirk Ohnstad(Prophessor Phusion), you can't really go wrong. These guys are definitely talented musicians.    I can't really put my finger on who plays what...because they all switch instruments for each song. But if I had to, it would be like this:  Ryan Neighbors: Lead Vocals/Guitar/Drums/Keyboards Matthew Moore: Guitar/Bass Kirk Ohnstad: Guitar/Drums/Cow Bell  This band is definitely a band to look out for.   I saw their first show? I think? Last night with good pals Chris Higgins and Ryan Moore. It was awesome.

      I have some Bad news...  Ramones Guitarist Losing Fight with Cancer -Report  Tue Jun 15, 8:50 PM ET      LOS ANGELES - The guitarist with pioneering punk rock band the Ramones is fighting a losing a battle with cancer in a Los Angeles hospital, Rolling Stone magazine reported on its Web site on Tuesday.            Johnny Ramone, 55, whose real name is John Cummings, was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago, and it has now spread throughout his body, Rollingstone.com quoted the band's drummer, Marky Ramone, as saying.    "Johnny's been a champ in confronting this, but at this point I think the chances are slim," Marky Ramone said in the report. "John never smoked cigarettes, he wasn't a heavy drinker and he was always into his health. It just proves when cancer seeks a body to penetrate, it doesn't matter how healthy you are or how unhealthy you are. It just seeps in and there's nothing you can do."    The Ramones, famed for playing their high-energy, unpolished songs at breakneck speed, rose to fame in New York City in 1974, paving the way for such British punk rock icons as the Sex Pistols and the Clash.    The band made its mark with such tunes as "Blitzkrieg Bop," "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue" and "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker," but it never achieved the same commercial success as acts that followed in its path. The Ramones officially retired in 1996.    The band's singer, Joey Ramone (ne Jeff Hyman), died in 2001 of lymphatic cancer, while bassist Dee Dee Ramone (Douglas Colvin) died from a drug overdose the following year.

"hey! wait!" he says.  "ive got a new complaint."  "forever in debt to your priceless advice."  who's kurt talking to? will we ever know? probably not.   what a nice guitar solo.  ever play enter the matrix? i like enter the matrix. why? because i can slow down time and dodge bullets and fly.   i think this journal is the best place to keep a list of cds that i need to buy:  Sonic Youth - Sonic Nurse (Is it any good?) and Daydream Nation  Pink Floyd - The Wall, Animals, Wish You Were Here  The Pixies - Doolittle (I need the real thing), Death to the Pixies, Wave of Mutilation - The Best of the Pixies  The Shins - Chutes Too Narrow  Jimi Hendrix - Are you Experienced?

      OH man you guys. Vodka Explosion II is up at  urlLink brandonmitchell.org .  Vodka Explosion II is the long awaited sequel to Vodka Explosion. It is about four teenagers who get mixed up in a whole bunch of trouble when buying Vodka from a meth dealer.   The Movie is very good...the best movie Brandon has ever produced. It's filled with fun and excitement but if you havent seen Vodka Explosion I i strongly recommend you do watch it before viewing Vodka Explosion II so it will make sense.       WATCH IT NOW.

      OK. So...if you're alive right now, and old enough (or atleast smart enough) to understand how totally shitty the new millenium is...you would probably wish..like i do, that you lived in the past. Here's what im getting at..  The past 100 years were fucking awesome.  If you think about it the past 100 years had lots of history, tragedy, and entertainment...it's true. Every decade before the new millenium kicked a lot of ass.  Let's look at a timeline of the past 10 decades.  1900's - The Begining  1900  - Booker T.

It was considered unsinkable until then.     1914  - The United States declares itself officially neutral in World War I..which lasts until 1917.     1920 "The Roaring Twenties"    1920  - Jazz becomes wildly popular around America.  -Two gunmen robbed and killed the guard and paymaster of a South Braintree, Massachusetts shoe factory.  Two Italian immigrants were convicted of the murder which created a national public outcry of innocence and an unfair trial.    -League of Nations is established in Geneva by Woodrow Wilson and other world leaders.    -Adolf Hitler helps organize the Nazi party in Germany with his radical views and new ideas.

      OK. I don't know about you but i am sick and tired of a few people. People who just...rack my nerves....who are annoying beyond the point of no return. People who just...don't deserve what they have.   And this person...is considered a role model for millions of American girls, she's beautiful, she's charming, she's perfect.   YEAH RIGHT.   Who am i talking about?  None other than:     BRITNEY FUCKING SPEARS  Ever since she appeared on the scene back in 1999 i have disliked her. Why you may ask?  A few reasons:  1.   SHE CAN'T SING:   If you've ever taken the time to notice...what she sings about is total nonsense and utter  bullshit.  I mean her songs really aren't about anything else besides having sex with random men, not being too young, not being too old, not being a girl, not being a woman, doing it again, and having lips that are capable of injuring or killing by poison....or being TOXIC.  2.   Can she keep her breasts under control?:   If you haven't noticed, the size of Britney's breats change dramatically. Need proof?     Britney before the dramatic change.     New and improved.  3.   Can she make up her fucking mind?:   Britney seems to be confused..about a lot of things...her lyrics seem to have changed along with her body.  Examples:     "Hit Me Baby One More Time"  -  from the album "Baby One More Time"     Lyrics:  Oh baby, baby Oh baby, baby Oh baby, baby How was I supposed to know That something wasn't right here Oh baby baby I shouldn't have let you go And now you're out of sight, yeah Show me, how you want it to be Tell me baby 'Cause I need to know now what we've got  ( How was i supposed to know? this must mean how was she supposed to know how her man was feeling when she slept with the guy next store. )  [CHORUS:] My loneliness is killing me I must confess, I still believe When I'm not with you I lose my mind Give me a sign Hit me baby one more time    ( This is basically saying she is lonley and she wants to get humped one more time. )   Slutty? I think so.  Let us also analyze lyrics to  "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"     "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman"   -  from the album "Britney"   Lyrics:   I used to think  (....really?)  I had the answers to everything  (If you do why dont you answer this: Are you an attention whore?   Or just a whore? )        But now I know   That life doesn't always go my way , yeah (When life doesnt go your way....where does it go?)   Feels like I'm caught in the middle  (No...but something else is...) That's when I realize   I'm not a girl, not yet a woman  (If you're not a girl and you're not a woman...then you've gotta be that other thing....)  All I need is time A moment that is mine While I'm in between  I'm not a girl (....she admits it)   There is no need to protect me (...from sexually transmitted diseases.. ) It's time that I Learn to face up to this on my own, oh  I've seen so much more ( penis ) than you know now   So don't tell me to shut my eyes  (well....think about it...)  I'm not a girl, not yet a woman  All I need is time ( ...to hide the damaging effects of herpes..)  A moment that is mine  While I'm in between (...his legs ) I'm not a girl     You will see it in my eyes But if you look at me closely This girl will always find her way (into your pants!)    Basically what Britney is saying is that she is horny and can't wait to have sex and she just wants it over and over every single day.    And she goes on to other singles such as "I'm a Slave for You" and "Oops! I Did it Again." to say things such as "I'm not that innocent."  ...which leaves me to do nothing but agree.  YOU ARE  NOT  INNOCENT.  ...AT ALL.   4.   Can she get any sluttier?:   If you own a television set and have atleast basic cable...or atlest free cable, you probably have noticed how scandalous and how....skanky she looks.      "Oops..my shirt fell off!"      Skank ho.      Fat ass.         ATTENTION    WHORE!    I think i rightfully proved my point. Britney Spears is not a good example for little girls nor is she someone to turn to for advice..seeing that her own life is very fucked up as she keeps getting "screwed." Someone stuff a fucking sock in her throat. For all our sakes.     Also...     MADDOX RULES      I was reading things on Maddox's site and i thought "wow i want to be as smart as this guy..this guy...he is the man." >Which he is.  And what i just pulled a few lines up^ Yeah well that was influenced by Maddox...i have something on my mind...and that is:  Britney Spears sucks ass.    urlLink Go to Maddox

      OHHH!!!! MY SPIDER SENSE IS TINGLING!  and do you know what it's telling me?  My spider sense says Spiderman 2 was the perfect sequel to the best superhero movie ever. Spiderman has to be the best superhero movie and movies ever. Better than Batman, better than Meteorman, better than The Increidble Hulk, X-Men, ANYTHING, SPIDERMAN BEATS THEM ALL OUT. Everything was so well put together, so well thought and planned out.    The relationships between characters left me guessing about the next "situation." The tension between Peter and Mary Jane left me asking questions till the end. The characters were so real, it was as if they weren't acting at all. Especially Doctor Octopus, he did so well of a job at acting that it was like he wasn't acting at all...like that's who he really is. AND THE ACTION, the action was so well animated and even though we all know it was all computer generated it still was a great use of computer animation..they did a VERY good job at mixing real fighting scenes with animated ones. The action was so real, I felt like I was flying around with Spiderman, and at some scenes they would have first person views of the action and it made me feel like I was there. The movie gave "me wrinkles and it makes my rump shake" to quote Eagles of Death Metal. But overall, if you were to see any action movie this year, Spiderman 2 IS that movie.   Like the first Spiderman, Spiderman 2 leaves a large hole in the plot....that will be filled in Spiderman 3. Like other movies, the Spiderman movies leave great start ups for the next movie.  Thank god for Spiderman, a sure save from movies like "White Chicks."   urlLink     I love these movies.

      This is an interview with Michael Moore, conducted by Bill O'Reilly....and may i say Bill is just an asshole to everyone who doesnt agree with him. Nobody should ever watch this show.   urlLink Michael Moore VS Bill O'Reilly Part 1    urlLink Michael Moore VS Bill O'Reilly Part 2   I personally think Moore won in the end, and O'Reilly just wouldn't say that he would send his child to war to secure Fallujah. O'Reilly afterwords then goes on to talk shit about Michael, when he's not around to defend himself, god Bill O'Reilly is a fucking coward, and I don't know about him, but i would definitely not send my child to war to secure fallujah. I hate you Bill, Michael may want you to live, but I dont care if you do or dont. You stupid motherfucking, piece of shit, asshole, bitch, jerk, dick, republican cock sucker.

      This movie, was a good sequel, but had some flaws. Like during the action, the camera keeps shaking and moving, and it just won't focus on the action, which pissed me the hell off. But otherwise, it was just like the first movie. This isn't the best sequal in the world, but if Spiderman 2 hadn't been released, i would say it was the best sequal this year, so don't let my stupid opinion stop you from seeing this movie because it was actually quite good.   urlLink       urlLink The Bourne Supremacy: The Chase   Watch this scene from the movie.
