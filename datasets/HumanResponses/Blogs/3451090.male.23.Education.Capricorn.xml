      From  The Sun 's Health Q&A section:  Several years ago I noticed a slight tickling feeling on my tongue.  I brushed and gargled to no avail.  Then I noticed that my tongue had started to turn black.  I had just had a gold crown put on a top molar.  There was a silver filling directly below it on the bottom tooth.  My dentist figured out that the tickling feeling was actually an electrical current produced when the two metals touched.   This was [electrocuting] my tongue and destroying the tissue.  ... [In essence,  I] had a battery in my mouth .  I hate  Parade Magazine  (almost as much as  USAT ), but this is great advice:   Q.  My wife and I have a bet.  I say that a ceiling fan is useless if no one is present to benefit from the breeze.  She says it still is cooling the room.   A:  The ceiling fan actually is  warming  the air.  That's because its motor is connected to the electricity and drawing energy into the room.  When people are present, they may feel cooler due to the breeze, but the air itself is a bit warmer.  And when no one is around, the fan is worse than nothing: It's a heater.

      I wrote a letter on the train this morning.   Dear Obnoxious Subway Riders:   Turn off your cell phones and Gameboys!   I don't mind their use at home, or while walking down the street, or even at the store, but for the love of all that is good and right, there is NO REASON to play anything that chirps, or answer anything that rings "Beethoven's Fifth," at 5-F-ing-30 in the morning!  I ask for this courtesy because recently you've kept me up during my 20-minute naptime into work.  I don't want to listen to your game of Tetris, or your side of the conversation with some other freak who's also up before sunrise -- and no one else wants to hear you either.  So do me and everyone else a favor: SLEEP! Just like every other half-conscious sap on the Johns Hopkins line.  You especially, Mr. Bed Head; you're not getting the superlative for Best Multitasker on a Subway.  If you need to be productive, read the newspaper or get a vasectomy so you don't contribute to the gene pool.  So help me Jebus, if I have to listen to Super Mario jump around that screen of yours for another 20 minutes, you  will  be riding  underneath  the subway.  Thanks for reading.  Lots of love, Jay In other news...   The beard is gone.   During this extremely long workday, I kept touching my face (I wanted to make sure it was still there) and consequently itched my cheeks.  It wasn't painful so much as annoying, and I finally resolved to either shorten the facial scrub or just take it off entirely.  Well, my hand got a little ahead of itself, and before I knew it my sideburns were distinguishable and only a scruff of puff was left on my chin.  I'm digging the goatee-    Stop!   Etymology time.  Not entomology, that's the study of bugs (I always confused them, too!).  Etymology, the study of word origins, has been a minor interest of mine since college and  goatee  is a fascinating example of Americans' evolution of the English language.  From  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition :  Although the goatee raises few eyebrows now, the early comments were not favorable: "One chap's...rigged out like a show monkey, with a little tag of hair hangin down under his chin jest like our old billy goat, that's a leetle too smart for this latitude, I think." This 1842 description, found in William Tappan Thompson's Major Jones's Courtship, also reveals the etymology of the word. The first recorded occurrence of the word itself, found in Daniel Lee and Joseph H. Frost's Ten Years in Oregon (1844), also sounds disapproving: "A few individuals...leave what is called, by some of their politer neighbors, a 'goaty' under the chin." So neat.  And remind me to relate the derivation of  lukewarm  in a future entry.  That one takes the cake! :)  (Cont'd from A1) -- and I think I'll keep it through the weekend.  And what am I doing this weekend? Just visiting my favorite city (Washington, DC) to attend the World War II Memorial dedication ceremony, as well as catch a concert by the Gin Blossoms and LIVE in  urlLink Rockville .  Awesome locale. Awesome commemorative event. Awesome music.  Plus, I'm going with Christina, the sweetest lady  EVER  and Brad, undoubtedly the most devout LIVE fan  EVER .  I'm super-psyched, especially because I'm finally going to see Shawn the Roadie! ("SHAWN SAYS ROCK ON!")  I'm sure I did more today, but my fingers are demanding sleep, so I'll cut this short and pick it up again tomorrow.  'Til then,  "Seeya!"

      For my friends seriously in need of a "Survivor"-fix, I offer  urlLink this  six-week supplement.  Granted, there's no Johnny Fair Play, but Tom DeLay is just as slimy.  And you've gotta admit, Dick Cheney's  au natural  look is a bit more flattering than Richard Hatch's.  My favorite is the vitriol-spewing vixen, Ann Coulter; sure, she may be a jingoistic whack job in real life  and  a pixilated cartoon character in this series, but she's still hotter than Amber.

      To keep readers posted on the impending Apocalypse, I present this  urlLink article .    Camryn Manheim's Sitcom Scoop!   by Daniel R. Coleridge of "TV Guide"   Life after The Practice will be all laughs for Camryn Manheim. At least, it could be, if ABC greenlights the spinoff sitcom David E. Kelley has pitched for her attorney character. "I'm hoping Ellenor Frutt isn't relegated to late-night reruns," Manheim tells TV Guide Online. "I adore her so much and I hope we can see her some more. I'm certainly not tired of her."   Created by Dan O'Shannon — who's written for Frasier and Cheers — the half-hour comedy would be a first. "Dan came to David and me with a really interesting idea to transfer a dramatic character to a comedy," Manheim enthuses. "It's really never been done. It's been done the other way — with [The Mary Tyler Moore Show's] Lou Grant, when he went from a comedy to a drama."  Here's the premise: "Basically, Ellenor decides to go back to her hometown, where she interacts with her mother and two sisters," the actress explains. "I think she'll teach at the local college, so she'll be able to spout her legalese and all of her righteousness, but then have to deal with people who know her the best." The series will likely be set in upstate New York, though that isn't set in stone. (And no word on who'll play Ellenor's sibs yet, but Lara Flynn Boyle's looking for work... Just kidding!)  Anyway, the show sounds like an intriguing experiment. We hear there'll be no laugh track or live audience — but also no serial murderers dressed in nun costumes. "This will be a comedy," says Kelley, "whereas The Practice was a drama, and a gritty drama at that. We didn't have many occasions to be funny over the years. When clients are on trial for murder, it's tough to get the giggles."  Kelley's gang hopes to shoot the Ellenor spinoff in the fall and have it on ABC's midseason roster. Of course, Manheim pragmatically notes, "the [executive] hierarchy of ABC has changed, so you never know."     Revelations 23:19 "Then I saw the beast gathering the corporations of the earth and their advertising armies in order to boost ABC's poor Nielsen ratings.  And the beast captured a sodomite advocate, and created for her a sitcom."

      I'm a bit nervo.  I start my work in SU's Dean of Students Office on July 6.  One of my responsibilites is redesigning the Perc Place (Ithacan equivalent: IC After Dark) net site ( urlLink check it out ).  Clearly this shouldn't be tough to improve upon, but I'm a little more than a year out of any regular Web design  (and even at my best, I still only had the fundamentals of HTML coding; I'm a Dream Weaver neophyte!).   That's why I'm devoting the remainder of May and all of June to brushing up my net skills.  I can't promise that I'll be a hacker by the time I finish this crash course, but I hope to have my graphic design and page layout abilities back.  Look for fun and exciting additions to  Your Daily Badingkaba , as well as a companion net page soon.  In the meantime, you should appreciate how awesome I am for including this hot picture of Anne B. Davis and the  urlLink true story  of what  really  happened to Tiger.

       "24" has lost its edge.  It's first season was brilliant, despite Kim's multiple abductions, Teri's amnesia, and Nina's inability to go evil until the final episode.  A fresh concept, gritty characters, and unrelenting tension made the show a serious compulsion during my Season One DVD Marathon.  How could I  not  watch four or five episodes in a row when so much was left unresolved after each show?  But the glory days of "24" have passed, as has the program's focus.  The stories remain imaginative, but the imminent doom of seasons one and two is absent.  This year featured a biological weapon, but no one seemed to give a damn about it.  Consider:     President Palmer was so wrapped up in dumping his girlfriend (what was  that  all about?) and running for re-election, how could he worry about Homeland Security?   Wayne and Sherry were too busy playing politics to notice that the Terror Color Chart had been upped to red.  (Palmer and Co. felt like one huge, irrelevant B story.)   That bonehead Chase got shot in the hand and then winced his way through the rest of the season, as much from the wound as his pointless "Surprise! I have a baby I haven't told anyone about!"-story arc.  (Besides giving Chloe   (DIE CHLOE!)   another reason to be obnoxious, what did that story element add to the show?) If he hadn't expended his three braincells worrying about Kim and his surprise daughter, maybe he could've devoted himself to finding the virus?   Tony and Michelle at least  tried  to focus on the weapon.  Sure, the writers explored their relationship, but even when they were having marital problems (because clearly rocky relationships can't be put on hold during a national crisis) they never strayed too far from the enemy of the hour.  Still, did anyone else find it odd that Tony -- after undergoing surgery at 3p  to remove a bullet from his neck  -- was back on the job by 6p?   Only Jack stayed fixed on the virus all season long.  Between sorting out everyone else's problems, battling his heroin addiction (nice touch, writers), and supplicating the virus holders, poor Jack could've used some support.   But at least Kim wasn't kidnapped.     It's a cliché, but too many CTU agents spoil the plot.  The abundance of story lines and writers' unwillingness to focus everyone on the same national emergency gave the season an entirely sloppy, poorly planned feel.  Consequently, last night's conclusion felt weak.  Tying up these silly side stories detracted from the show's ability to deliver its usual finale's worth of blowout action and complex resolutions.  I understand the writers' intent to cleanly wrap up this season after the still-unresolved cliffhanger from season two, but c'mon, Joel Surnow, if the greatest thrill you can generate is chopping off a character's hand (especially a character I hate), then your initial story arc progressions and breakdowns need to be better vetted.  Granted, last week's episode boiled with tension (especially Saunder's hostage exchange and Sherry and Wayne's confrontation) and if the series had ended then, I think I could've forgiven some of the more derivative stories.  I definitely would've gotten my Depends-worth in action!  But as  urlLink USAT  notes, there's change in the works.  With a pared down cast and a retooling of the show, surely the storytelling will be sharper and the plot far more national crisis-driven when it returns in January.  Like a Cubs' fan, I place my hopes in next season.     After Thought:  I'm going to miss Super Villainess Sherry Palmer.  I loved her final demand that she and David remarry, that would've uncomfortably put both characters together next season, and also ratcheted up the tension between them.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be, and I'll have to get my fill of Penny Johnson-Jerald in reruns from now on.  :(

      This beard is getting out of control.  Whenever I perspire my face feels like it's covered in wool.  Not the most comfortable itchy sensation.  During lunch today, I had another octogenarian moment: Eating some yogurt, I completely missed my mouth (c'mon...it's not like I've been feeding myself for almost 23 years now...) and instead spread a nice trail of key lime yogurt (in its Ecto Cooler green glory) all across my chin, and consequently my beard.  Not only did I have to wash my face and beard, but afterward I had to dry both by paper towel, and then  brush  my facial hair.  News flash, clean shaven folks: Beards get unruly if you don't daily shampoo and comb them.  But enough...if I keep this up, I'm going to end up shaving the beard off, and then the middle aged ladies at work won't compliment me anymore.  And as everyone knows, I love the ego boosts.  :)  The apartment hunt continues.  I think I've got a v. good lead in Dewitt, a 'burb of Syracuse.  Mark, a law student from Bath, NY, advertised his apartment on OrangeHousing.com, and both the place and potential roommate seem great.  Plus, rent is  half  of what I'm paying here in Bmore,  and  it includes heat (something oh-so essential during the nine months of winter in Upstate New York).  This story is still developing.  Hah! I'm starting to write  urlLink Matt Drudge  headlines.  You can write the guy off as a yellow journalist with no regard for story credulity, but when it comes to breaking tomorrow's news before papers go to press, I haven't found anyone better.  And his teaser headlines are pretty sweet, too.  Badingkaba.

       I just clicked on Tori Amos.  I'm in a foul mood and "From The Choirgirl Hotel" definitely suits me now.  I've been bummed since I woke up.  It's a restlessness borne more of idleness than any great discontent.  My Friday off allowed me to run all of my usual weekend errands, as well as get caught up on bills, balancing my checkbook, and making appointments.  By yesterday evening I'd taken care of all my busy work!  ::sigh::  I slept almost eight hours last night (who  does  that?!), and after a quick breakfast, I crashed on the couch for the next two and a half hours.  I know I'm bored when I can't even rouse myself to stay conscious for "Wait, Wait!"  I'd go to the pool and tan/swim, but it's raining.  And it has been since I awoke.  And it's expected to last into the night.  Scroll bar gray sky, drizzle, cool, bleh.  How's a boy to worship the sun if his deity stays hidden?  At least the cicadas have shut up.  Six-weeks of sex and the only time they rest is when it rains.  Maybe it's like a cold shower? Or maybe all the lady cicadas have headaches? (After listening to the males' incessant screeching, they probably don't even need to pretend to have migraines.  Were I a lady cicada, I'd only mate with a deaf cicada and hope that my offspring were mutes, too.)  I know this restlessness won't last.  I've got some great entertainment planned this week: A visit from Sheilakatzowitz on Sunday afternoon, and a $3 Vertical Horizon concert on Thursday night.  I haven't seen Skatz since I graduated (even though she interned in DC over the spring), and I haven't seen VH since the Utica roadtrip sophomore year (when Allie Peck drove off the Thruway ramp because the roads were so slick!).  I'm sure both events will improve my disposition.  Compound that with SSA classroom training (read: goof off day) on Tuesday (I get to drive to work  and  I don't have to show up until 7:45a! WOOHOO!) and a day off on Wednesday for a day-long dentist appointment (it's only an hour and a half to fill out paperwork and get a checkup, but I'm taking the whole day off to burn more sick leave) and before I know it, Friday will be back again.    News flash:  Ronald Reagan passed away at 1p.  I may not have work on Monday now.  The federal government closes for a president's passing, so this week could be exceptionally short.  [Story still developing.]  Kris and I had our usual Saturday afternoon talk, which improved my spirits.  She's such a good conversationalist.  If I could live next door to any of my friends, I'd definitely border her backyard so she could lean over the fence and talk to me all the time.  Kinda like Wilson and Tim, only I'd be able to see her face.  And she'd also be a girl.  I scarfed a veggie burger for lunch.  I started eating these meatless products last year for Lent, and though I haven't fasted since, I've still enjoyed Boca and Morningstar foodstuffs.  I'm not a full veterinarian, but I'm taking baby steps to get there.  My main problem is that there just aren't many meat substitutes at my grocery store.  I need Weggies for that.  After months of gym-less-ness, I'm rededicating myself to (as Will calls it) "Gay Church." I hate going, but if I can stick with it for the rest of the month, GJ will keep me motivated once I'm in Syracuse-  (P.S.: Greg, you need to visit my office every day and make sure I've gone or am going to the gym.  Thanks.)  -plus, Mark says he wants to get back "into the gym of things," so I hope to have several gym buddies this summer.   I've already added more fruits and veggies to my daily intake (I eat spinach like I own stock in it), plus I've switched from white to wheat bread (major change after 22 years!), and I'm eating low- or no-fat dairy products (except for sliced cheese, since I froze a bunch before I started buying healthier stuff).  My major problem is cutting out the snack foods.  I know that if I could lose the chips, I'd be back to wearing 32-waist pants.  But dropping two inches is a challenge, so I'm trying to get an appointment with a nutritionist.  I'm watching my caloric intake, but I'd also like some professional guidance.  And since my insurance covers a specialist's assistance, I may as well get the help while I can.  Being healthy is a lot of work, as Ian reminds me regularly, but I figure it's like any other habit: Once I'm used to regular exercise again, I'll feel crappy when I don't do it.  Kinda like brushing my teeth.  Or changing my underwear.  And with those mental images, I'm off to fix a huge spinach salad.  That always improves my mood.

      The email came in just after lunch.   Do you like mice? Can you come back and get rid of one for us?  I hadn't planned to do much during my final hour of work, maybe catch up with the  New York Times  or listen to another interview on "Fresh Air." If I were really feeling ambitious, I might even work a new case.  I hadn't expected to start SSA's rodent catch and release program.  Before I'd even fully removed my headphones, I heard her scream.  Iris, a middle-aged coworker (who found my beard sexy), trembled and shouted from atop her desk, pointing at the scurrying mouse as he scrambled away from the terrified humans.   This scrawny fuzzball wasn't more than an inch long, yet for all the shrieking from my officemates, one would think a rotweiler ran wild in the training module.  Maybe if a tarantula were loose I'd react similarly, but something half the size of Stuart Little (and equally as cute) hardly seemed worth getting worked up over.  To her credit, Catie continued coding cases with her feet elevated off the ground.  Marchette and Tosha didn't appreciate Mickey's company, but they weren't hysterical over him either.  That was left to Fanta (and to a lesser extent Iris), who stood on her chair  screaming  for a leave slip, insisting that she couldn't work like this.  If she hadn't seriously seemed terrified, I probably would've laughed.  My manager was also present for all of this.  After a quick minute of searching, Brad, Ron, and I found our favorite rodent scrambling for the safety of Cynthia's desk.  In one quick swoop, I dropped an empty waste bin over the little guy.  Fanta and some of the others audibly sighed.  I slid a stiff piece of cardboard underneath the overturned trashcan and with Ron's help escourted Mighty Mouse out of The Big House and into some neighboring mulch.  Strangely, the security guards seemed nonpulsed by a mouse being walked out of the building...does it happen regularly or were they just  that  bored?  I came back to some limited applause and thank yous from my officemates, but unfortunately my manager didn't offer me a promotion for my pest-control prowess (I expect to bring it up at my monthly performance evaluation).  Meanwhile, Fanta still wouldn't sit at her desk.   On  her desk, yes.   At  her desk, no.  Her worried posture made me laugh: her butt on the desktop, keyboard on her lap, feet on the seat of her chair, her body angled toward the computer monitor.  Quite an overreactor, I thought as I sat back at my desk.  That's about the time I heard the next round of screams and direct calls for my mouse-catching assistance.  I gave the room a once over, but Minnie was far better at concealement than her snagged friend and I wasn't willing to work credit time to play animal control officer.  At 2:30p I left with both Fanta and the mouse in hiding.  I hope they both made it out safely.

      George Tenet, Director Central Intelligence Agency Washington, DC 20505  June 3, 2004  Jason Michael Tifone 1500 Woodlawn Drive Baltimore, MD 21230 Dear Director Tenet:   I'm deeply saddened over your resignation as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.  Though I understand your desire for more time with your family, the nation and I mourn your loss of leadership and effective information management.  Undoubtedly, history will smile on your integral involvement in the War on Terror.  Perhaps more disheartening than your forthcoming departure are liberals' cynical and contemptuous commenting.  All day the yellow  New York Times  has speculated over the "real reason" you're leaving (or as the Intelligista suggests, why you've been "forced out").  Democratic rumor mongers question your resignation's timing, noting how close it comes to President Bush's European tour of World War II battlefields.  Some Kerry supporters even have the gall to suggest your "dismissal" was  orchestrated  to cause minimal damage to the president's re-election campaign.  As usual, the evening news programs went out of their way to highlight the "missteps" of your directorship, as if Tom Brokaw or Peter Jennings never made a mistake or two.  With their usual left-wing smirks of superiority, reporters chronicled your faults, noting the CIA's:    Abysmal showing before the  urlLink 9-11 Commission ,  Faulty intelligence over  urlLink supposed-African uranium  sold to Iraq for WMDs,  Faulty intelligence over Iraq's  urlLink "clear and present danger"  to America,  Faulty intelligence  urlLink linking  the War on Terror with the liberation of Iraq,   urlLink Slam-dunk-able  - yet somehow still missing - stockpiles of Iraqi chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons,   urlLink Leaked name  of an undercover agent to Robert Novak of the  Washington Times   Failure to  urlLink coordinate intelligence  with the FBI,  Inability to  urlLink structurally change   over the next five years  (in addition to the almost three years since 9-11) to handle a terrorist threat,  Failure  urlLink prior to 9-11  to communicate the threat terrorists posed to America, despite a presidential daily briefing from August 6, 2001 titled  urlLink "Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US,"  and  Supposed-failure to communicate to President Bush that your own  urlLink intelligence was bad.     I understand it's typical anti-administration slander, but nevertheless it's dispiriting.  I can only hope that such maliciousness slips from the news cycle shortly, supplanted by the president's addresses to the Italians and French this weekend, drawing parallels between the Coalition of the Willing's liberation of Iraq and the Allies' liberation of Europe.  Though the world's forgotten, both you and President Bush have continually reminded our international brothers that might  does  make right.  We are a stronger nation for your commitment to such courage.  As a man proud of his Hellenic roots, your example proves to GOYAns everywhere that no door is barred to Greek-Americans.  I commend your great service to this nation and the integrity and strength you've restored to our national character.  Thank you.  - Jason Michael Tifone

      Apparently the Mediterranean ancestry, olive-colored skin, and short time tanning weren't enough to ward off my first sunburn of the year.  Yes...even Tifones glow like WASPs when we get our first blast of summer sun.  I skipped out on the World War II Memorial dedication ceremony on Saturday in favor of a quick swim before the LIVE concert (c'mon...it's not like the vets knew I was missing... most of them don't even remember they were there... ).  Unfortunately the pool people were cleaning the water, so I was relegated to a lawn chair where I chatted with Kris for 45 minutes (one of our shorter Saturday chats).  By the time I got to the concert in Rockville several hours later, I was itching up a storm, and it wasn't just because the cicadas were crawling all over me.  A glance at my thighs revealed a shade of fluorescent pink I haven't seen since 1992.  My chest, I later found, had ripened to a similar color.  Fortunately I lathered myself up in aloe (ahhhhhh aloe!) and functioned well that evening and all day Sunday (and by "functioned" I mean "slept").  On Monday the pain wasn't as intense, but the itching grew worse.  Again, I applied more aloe, but by this morning (Tuesday) I think my chest and legs had grown immune to the soothing balm.  My burned skin felt relieved for all of 2.5 seconds after the aloe application...and then the itching resumed.  I tried to keep myself occupied with casework, but the more I fought the irritation, the more I remembered my bout with shingles.  Finally I broke down and just let myself itch, which I'm sure my coworkers found quite entertaining:  Random Coworker 1: "Looks like Jay's got fleas again!" Random Coworker 2: "I told him to wear his collar..." By midday I went to the nurse's office.  I'd left my aloe at home (another brilliant move by yours truly), so I figured I'd just borrow some.  What I forgot is that I work for the federal government.  Why would the nurse's office have anything to treat a burn?  The best Nurse Frogenson could provide was hydrocortisone, and she thought steroids weren't the answer to my discomfort (damn!).  As she rummaged through her drawers of meds, I slowly tried to backpedal my way out of the office.  Clearly I was wasting my time if she didn't have aloe and she refused to shoot me up with 'roids.  But then Nurse Frogalot found a topical cream.  Salvation!  Unfortunately, it was hemorrhoid cream.  Suction!  Yes, the label read  (in very tiny lettering)  that it also relieved sunburn irritation,  but its primary use was the treatment of rectal flare-ups .  But as my itching intensified, that concern quickly dissipated.  (She could've said eating bat guano would make me feel better and I'd have done it.)  Instead of giving  me  the tube and sending me into a sideroom to apply the cream, Nurse Frogger slapped on her rubber gloves, ordered my shirt off, and proceeded to lather me up herself.  I'm still not sure why -- maybe she was afraid I'd use the hemorrhoid cream on my secret hemorrhoids? -- but I sure felt uncomfortable.  As her gloved fingers probed me, oblivious to my extreme awkwardness, she happily discussed breeding her amphibians (further sexual innuendo?).  I could only squawk out replies.  A few minutes later, I left less itchy, but also slightly taken advantage of.  I'm told I shouldn't blister, but I'm supposed to stay superhydrated and take aspirin for the pain.  Nurse Frogenstein explained why, too, but I was too busy being felt up to pay much attention.

      I'm assuming it's a freak -- like the little blonde ones that occasionally creep into my beard -- but I just found a single strand of white hair above my temple.  Does this mean I'm going gray? Will I soon be surrepticiously picking up Just for Men at CVS? Will my true hair color be a secret only my hair dresser knows?  If it's real and I'm starting to go gray, I know I could have it a lot worse.  I'm blessed with remarkably good health and a pretty high pain threshold.  Chronic disease is basically absent in my family (save for glaucoma, and if I get that, there's always medicinal SMI for salvation...).  Besides this and a fear of an eventual receding hairline, I suppose I'm okay.  I always said (back in my teens) that I'd grow old gracefully.  However, I figured I'd be youthful and vibrant well into my 80s, so by the time I sprouted my first white hair, I'd be ready to relinquish my youth and settle into elderly wisdomhood as a sort of modern day Gandalf, only without the accent and magical powers (...well, without  most  of the magical powers...).  I know what you're thinking, Gentle Reader: I have no right to bemoan the crappines of growing old at 23.  I'm still young by all accounts, and the  true  crappiness doesn't really begin until 24...or maybe 40.  Of course, you're right.  But for the past year I've been far more cognizant of my own mortality.  I've had plenty of near-death experiences in my near-quarter-of-a-century of life, but not even my worst driving blunder forced such thoughts.  I think my new perception of time comes from the way it's recently affected those around me.  Grandma Tifone went through rehab on a cracked sternum this winter and for the first time in her long life, she's finally started to slow down.  I wasn't ready for that.  This is the lady who, while parking in her garage a few years ago,  drove through the back wall  when she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake pedal.  And walked away completely unscathed.  This is the same spitfire whose ferocious conservative politics scared everyone but my brother and me from debating her over the dinner table, the same matriarch who taught me the joy of immersing myself in gardening and tending delicate Christmas cacti, the kindred spirit who shared her love for talk radio, card games, and penny gambling.  She was already 76 when I was born, but her high energy never flagged.  Today, at near-90 she's frailer, perhaps a bit more reluctant to careen through the back of a building.  It takes her longer to do her chores, and she relies on her children for help with groceries and maintaining the yard.  She's still cooking, but our afternoon dinners -- whenever I'm home for them -- seem pared down from their former Italian extravagance.    And I know I shouldn't be surprised.  After nine decades, it'd be unnatural if she  hadn't  slowed down.  But it's tough to synch my lifelong perception of her with this current reality, especially when the grandmother I knew -- a stubborn, self-reliant, spunky lady -- has lost some of her spark.  Her change has been a regular reminder that my life isn't static, either.  Whether 23 or 89, I'm still susceptible to time; my own youth is fleeting, even if I do live long enough to drive through a wall.  Knowing that, my task is simple: enjoy life, relish young adulthood, and appreciate these boyish good looks and full head of dark hair as long as they last.  Because I plucked that white sucker as soon as I saw it.  I'm more than aware of life's ephemeralness, I don't need the additional reminder.

      My ears are  still  ringing.  Almost half a day since the Gin Blossoms and LIVE left the stage, I'm deafer than usual and my voice is barely audible.   But the concert was m'kaying amazing!   Getting there is another story: I wound up getting lost.  As most will attest, that's typical when I'm driving.  But I've been living in/driving around DC for a couple years now, and I  know  how the District's laid out.  Or I thought I did.  Brad and Co. parked all the way on the east side at   Greenbelt  .  See  urlLink map .  That didn't make sense to me.  Why spend an additional 50 minutes on the subway (even though I would marry the Metro if public transportation weddings were legal) when I could drive to the west side, park at one of the closer Metro stations like   Grosvenor   or   Medical Center  , and metro the rest of the way? (There was  no way  I would drive into Rockville with the thousands of festival goers also scavenging for parking spots!) For some reason, I thought that both Metro stations were off of Connecticut Ave. (I'd just been sunburned, so maybe my brain was fried?) and I wound up driving well into the city until I realized I'd just passed   VanNess/UDC  .  I was TWO STATIONS from my old home of   Woodley Park  ...and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay past any place to park and ride.  I also had less than an 1/8 of a tank of gas.  I pulled off of Connecticut, grabbed $4.00 worth of $2.23/gallon gas (that was the only cash in my wallet since the frickin' gas station's ATM didn't work and credit wasn't accepted).  Grrr.  I got my bearings, finally remembered that the stations I needed were back on Wisconsin Ave. (duh, Jay, you only worked there!), and hopped on Abermale (yay Abermale!) until I cruised past   Tenleytown-AU  .  By the time I saw   Bethesda   I pulled the car off the road and said, "Bunk it! I'll metro in the rest of the way."  It was only an additional five stops, and the entire train ride took less than 10 minutes, but my supposedly shorter route ended up longer than Brad and Co.'s sojourn from far across the city in   Greenbelt  .  Oh, well...if I didn't have crazy driving adventures, what would you read about?  I found Brad, Christina, and Greg leaning against the stage fence, holding their spots in the first row: slightly right of center and directly in front of several human-sized amps.  LIVE didn't perform until 8:30p.  They'd shown up around 1:30p.  With the sun's merciless beating and kamikazeeing cicadas, I was glad I'd come at 4p.   By the time 6:30p struck, the Gin Blossoms started their set.  The first half hour seemed weak -- I didn't recognize many of their songs, and the audience didn't seem to either -- but they did play an occasional goodie like "Allison Road." It wasn't until the second half that they finally dipped into their '90s classics: "Hey Jealousy," "Til I Hear it from You," "Until I Fall Away," "Found Out About You," and "Follow You Down." (I didn't realize they'd put out so many hits, either!)  Robin Wilson, the lead singer, came alive during the hits and his distinct voice echoed just as it did on the radio almost a decade ago.  During "Hey Jealousy" he had the audience singing, and toward the end, he actually left the stage and got  on top of the fence  to sing to the crowd.  Everyone went nuts.  Holding the hand of a guy standing below him for support, he towered above the first row, belted the lyrics, and held the mic up for the crowd to sing the chorus with him.   And then, he started walking across the fence toward us!  It was an impressive example of balancing and well-placed supporting hands.  Robin stopped in front of Brad, and my boy got to support him (until Robin lost his balance and fell backward, unharmed and still singing).  I stood next to a cute girl (even if she was 16) and she held out her cell phone so Person on the Other End could hear the Gin Blossoms.  During "Til I Hear it from You" Robin came back to the audience and took her cell phone and sang into both his mic and her phone's mouth piece.    Again, we flipped out.  I high-fived Robin after that, which seemed like icing on an already awesome set.  Greg took some great photos and a few 15-second videos, so when I get those, I'll figure out a way to post them here.  LIVE took the stage about an hour later, and they were well worth the wait.  Brad's been a LIVE fan since "Throwing Copper," and last night was his 18th time catching them in concert (his 17th occurred the evening before at an exclusive concert in York -- city motto: "Capital of the KKK in PA!").  To call Brad a LIVE fanatic doesn't even come close to his level of dedication.  The boy religiously follows their net site, plus several other fan boards, tattooed his forearm with the "Birds of Pray" logo, and framed a drumhead from one of their music videos.  Full Pop (Brad's SSA name) is clearly obsessed.   LIVE started their show with three of their new songs, and they definitely pleased the crowd.  From there, the band dipped back into their repertoire and then ended the show (like GB) with hit after hit after hit.  Chad Taylor, LIVE's lead guitarist, tore up the stage during an especially frenetic version of an oldie (name escapes me) and had the audience screaming for more.  I've never seen a guitarist jump and jam at the same time quite like that.   Very  entertaining.  Ed Kowalczyk, LIVE's bald-pated lead singer, beamed with a 100-Watt smile the entire evening.  Between taking off his shirt, suggestively touching his stomach, and winking at just about every woman in the audience, he early-on stirred the crowd into a tizzy.  I enjoyed "I Alone" the most, although I thought "Beauty of Gray" and "Heaven" were also awesome.  The entire show was great fun, and very family friendly (despite Ed's slight exhibitionism/ego tripping).  I really appreciated that both the GB and LIVE kept their sets clean and family friendly, considering what a mixed crowd they were playing to.   Side Note:  You know you're getting old when your buddy whips out his lighter during a slow song and the teeny boppers around you are waving their lit up cell phones in the air.  I had a wonderful time, even if I could barely hear after the encore and fireworks.  And even though I had to walk across a cicada-strewn bridge on the way to my car (I recited the 23rd Psalm for comfort), I wouldn't trade the experience.  I'm definitely a LIVE convert, and I look forward to catching them this summer should they come to New York (no tour date yet).  You'll be happy to know I made it out of DC  without  getting lost, though I did stop and pay $2.13/gallon in gas at a Chevy Chase BP.  Since I had no voice to protest the outrageous prices, I took my rage out on the cicadas by running into them on the Beltway at 70 mph.  It seemed an appropriate way to end the day.

       urlLink   I just had a wonderful afternoon and night with my favorite sockle, Catie.  We caught "Shrek 2" together, which we enjoyed.  We both agreed that Puss in Boots reminds us of Airick, especially when doing his huge kitten eyes followed by his ferocious attacks.  They even look alike, although Airick doesn't often carry an epee or wear a wide-brimmed hat.  After the movie, we visited the mall for some window shopping.  While there I found some great stuff, including an awesome kitchen table with a reversible top for card playing and a bumper pool table BUILT IN! How amazingly awesome is that?! True, it's not like a foosball table, but um...you can't play Euchre on a foosball table! The whole deal cost $600, but that included 4 rolly chairs and the table, plus the cues and pool balls.  I just priced it out online, and no one seems to come close to that price.  So...I may go to SticksNStuff tomorrow and buy it.   urlLink   Zoinks!  Somebody stop me.  I'm OOC with my money this weekend.  I also bought a cool zip-up sweater from H&M.  It's red, white, and blue and it only cost me $13 (originally $26), so I'm already starting to buy for New York's autumn.  This goes along with the great deals I got on Wednesday -- slate gray corduroy pants ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), a knit green polo ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), an awesome Havana shirt (long sleeve, navy blue, very thin cotton, and open at the neck -- $36.00 discounted to $11.99), and a very cool 1950's style button-down short-sleeve shirt in red with two thick white stripes running along the buttons ($40.00 discounted to $9.77).  What can I say, I'm a shopping whizz! (Thank you Kris, my shopaholic girlfriend, for your excellent tips...though I was  not  impressed by the clearance stuff at Aeropostale...or Aeropostatle, as my mom refers to it.)  I attempted to get my cartilage pierced tonight, but no one at the mall can pierce a hoop.  Apparently I've gotta keep a stud in for 8 weeks before I can move to a ring.  Grrr.  I've gotta tell Brad, "We are readeeeeeeeehhhhh to get tattooooooooed." Catie thinks his tattoo guy can help me out with my piercing. [Story still developing.]  Yeah, I'm getting pierced again.  Deal.  I'm a student -- I should be an even greater exemplification of free expression and nonconformity.  Plus, I look hot with an earring.  And I've already got a soul patch, so I may as well complete the slacker look.  My recent Amazon order came.  I got the Crows' "This Desert Life" and I'm pretty impressed.  Favorite song: "Amy Hit the Atmosphere." Probably an odd pick, but there's something sorta haunting and sad about it.  Okay...that description fits just about  every  song sung by Adam Duritz, but it's especially true for this one.  I like the repetition of "And that's all that really matters to me." Such a great effect.  I'm slightly bummed that I'm missing the Crows concert this July.  They're playing in Columbia, MD (about 20 minutes away) and Brad and I planned on going.  The tickets were a bit steep ($30), but I'd be willing to fork it over to see my band.  Oh, well...the assistantship couldn't be passed up, even if I could've seen my band.  :(  Still no tour dates for NY or PA, so who knows if I'll catch them this summer? I may have to resign myself to CDs.  Speaking of concerts, the Vertical Horizon one utterly suctioned.  Not only did I wait in the rain for over an hour, but I did so after taking money out of a non-M&T ATM (thanks for the $2.75 service fee, plus M&T's $1.25 charge).  Oh, wait...but they didn't start their set at 7p.  They didn't go on until 10p-ish.  The opening band started sometime after 8p.  I gave up by 7:30p and walked around the Harbor talking to Chris for the next hour-plus.  I'd just come off a 10.5 hour shift at work, all I wanted to see was Vertical, but that definitely didn't happen at the scheduled start time (and I was told by the concert promoters they were playing at 7p).  To top off the perfect night, Tomm and I got into a stupid fight about whether journalism is analytical (I argued for the defense).  Somehow that spun into a huge yell fest complete with the F-bomb.  You know you're a dork who lives with a geek when you fight over the scholarliness of reporters (Like Fox News, we journalists report  and  decide.)  What else? I received my "Wait, Wait" tickets yesterday.  I'm so excited to see the show again...twice in three months.  How many dorks can claim that?  My room is currently a disaster.  My floor is covered in papers, envelopes, receipts, and things desperately in need of storage.  Somehow I've acquired more than I ever thought possible during my short ten months in Maryland.  I'm still re-reading "Otherland" (I'm on page 2000), but I've got a new bathroom read, Lynn Truss' "Eats, Shoots & Leaves." It's a book all about proper punctuation and the sticklers who enforce those rules.  I wouldn't think the audience was huge for such a subject, but I resolved to buy it once I heard Truss interviewed on an excellent edition of  urlLink "Fresh Air" . (I sure reference that show a lot! If you don't listen to it by now, you really don't know what you're missing.  Terry Gross sometimes isn't the best interviewer, but she always scores interesting subjects.) Well, turns out I'm not the only person who thinks this book is amazing...it's No. 1 on the NYT Best-sellers List.  I fell asleep on the couch this afternoon while watching President Reagan's funeral procession.  During my nap, I dreamt I was an only child living in a ranch in DC.  Only DC looked like Kansas.  And my dad was this skinny guy in a sailor's dress uniform who tried to impress me by telling jokes and dancing  a la  Fred Astaire.  Once he was through, I opened the front door and looked up at the sun ("as memories of Venus' transit danced through his head") to see mountains of fire hurling down on the horizon.  It was like that dream where I'm running to get out of the way of the falling helicopter, but even though it crashes far away, it still rolls toward me and almost chops me up, except that I wake up.  Anyway, I knew that the fire bombs were coming for me, and sure enough -- though they blasted a mountain on the horizon (apparently DC-Kansas isn't entirely flat) -- a huge wall of fire raced toward my home.  My mom (who looked like Auntie Em from "The Wizard of Oz") rushed me into the cellar and we hid under the stairs.  I kept trying to coax Airick to hide under the stairs with us, but he stubbornly sat just out of reach, and I thought for sure he'd get toasted.  That's when I awoke.    urlLink   I'm still waiting for my new checks.  I ordered a Muppet set, complete with Kermit, Piggy, Animal, and Fozzie.  When I received them, they contained Raggedy Anne and Andy.  I called my sister and asked her if a bunch of dolls on my checks didn't make her wonder if they'd gotten the order wrong.  She thought it seemed strange, but apparently it was within the realm of possibility of something Jay might adorn his checks with. urlLink     Well, let me set the record straight: While I may occasionally stray to some more effeminate interests, I guarantee that I will never in a million years put two stupid, and quite scary, dolls on my checks.  Even in my most ironic moment, I still wouldn't stoop  that  low.  I'm sure I could write more, but I'm getting a bit sleepy, so I suppose that's enough for now.  One more quick plug: Big Hits of the 90s on Yahoo's  urlLink Launchcast  is amazing.  This is the radio station that I hope someday to put on the XM.  Almost every song is a favorite of mine -- Toad the Wet Sprocket's "Walk on the Ocean" just started playing.  Score.  :)

       Feel like you're being stalked?  from  The Baltimore Sun  If you live or work in the city of Baltimore, Big Brother will soon be watching.  Check out the story in today's   urlLink Sun  .  Scary stuff, folks.   Reagan wasn't perfect?  from  Democracy Now  For those of you looking for something other than reverential fawning over  urlLink President Reagan  -- you know,  critical  reporting -- you might want to read over Amy Goodman and Co.'s analysis of the American presidency from 1981-1989.   urlLink    Bingo's Lingo  from  The Associated Press  For those of us who reguarly talk to our dogs, here's  urlLink evidence  that we may actually be getting through.   So long, Mr. Charles  from  CNN   urlLink Ray Charles  passed away late this morning.  He was 73.   But who mentioned this first?  from  CNN  Yup...that's  urlLink Republican "Survivor"  they're talking about.  Too bad I covered it a week ago! Sorry Ted Turner:  SIT DOWN!

       urlLink   I hear slurping.  He's perched atop the bookshelf, comfortably seated between two African violets.  Only his tail is visible from under the foliage.  He's noisily licking and chewing on the pollen-rich purple blooms.  Today Airick thinks he's a bee.  Unfortunately, this isn't new for my cat.  If he can do something quirky to make me shake my head in disbelief, he does.  Hence his regular:    overturning of large glasses of water on computer keyboards,   playing in, and licking of, the bathtub, and  jamming printers with his milk jug tabs.    When we first met last November, he was the noblest cat I'd ever seen.  As King of the Rescue Center he sat defiantly on an overturned garbage bin and monitored his pride, the other 20 cats in the holding pen.  He let me pet him for about 2.5 seconds before tiring and coolly walking away.  He was too aloof to tolerate being picked up (I got my first claw in the nipple for that), but for some reason (probably because I'm a sucker for hard cases) I decided that we were perfect for one another, I just had to make him a little friendlier.  Hah.  He's still standoffish and non-demonstrative when he doesn't want something.  When he craves attention or treats he miraculously transforms into one of the most in-your-face, smother-you-with-my-tail affectionate tabbies in felinedom.  Airick refused to lie on the couch last Sunday morning and watch "Face the Nation" with me.  But as soon as I grabbed a glass of milk, he wanted nothing more than to spend quality time together.  He ratcheted up his purring, crawled up and down my legs, and occasionally brushed an ear against the glass of milk.  When I stupidly put the cup down to pet him with both hands he wasted no time ditching me to plunge his face into the remaining milk (despite the fact that he's mildly lactose intolerant...).  But while he manipulates like any cat, he's also oddly canine.  Like a Retriever, Airick sleeps on his back with all four paws held close to his body.  And what's worse: He snores like a dog.  For a nine pound fuzzball, his wheeze sounds remarkably like a creaky old heating duct.  Of course, he's not  all  trouble and dysfunction.  Most of the time I find his cicada stalking amusing, and his willingness to watch "24" is always appreciated.  I also enjoy his habitualness.  As soon as I'm in bed each evening, Airick bounds out of his basket (yeah...he sleeps in a wicker basket) and prances up my chest.  He waits to get his ears scratched, then moseys down to my stomach, turns 180 degrees, and plops down on his side, purring as I stroke his forehead.  If I go to bed later than usual, he hunts me down and meows as if annoyed that I've disrupted our routine.  I'm always the first one up, and by the time I turn off the shower I can hear plaintive meowing from the other side of the bathroom door.  And like a well-trained heel, I run to the door, crack it, then hop back into the shower to dry off.  This quiets Airick, who then gets on the toilet and investigates the still-wet tub.  Once I've left the room, he props himself up against the shower's soap dish where he drinks the collected water (I don't keep any soap there, so the water's clean).  When I return to brush my teeth -- and I'm laughing as I write this, because the same thing happens every weekday morning -- I find him standing on his hind legs slurping away.  As soon as he notices me, he freezes up, panics, then tears out of the bathroom.  (Of course, when I yell at him for walking on the countertops, he doesn't bat an eye...)  There's definitely something wrong with this cat.  Generally he stays awake long enough to see me off around 5:20a, and whenever I return that afternoon, he rouses himself from his nap on one of the dining room chairs.  I open the door, announce my arrival with a loud "Honey, I'm home," he trots to the door, bows (okay,  stretches ) before me, meows very loudly, then follows me around the apartment until I sit down and scratch his ears.  Usually we listen to "Fresh Air with Teri Gross" on the couch together.  But lately Airick's been especially weird.  And not just because he's eating more flowers.  Whenever he sees a bird on the balcony he maniacally hisses, a sound not unlike a Fischer Price lawnmower with a backed-up muffler.  Coupled with his quivering body and bared tiny-tot teeth, I often wonder if my scrawny cat is epileptic.  Or mentally ill.  Of course, he doesn't help his case when he attacks the screen door as a proxy for the birds outside.  Though he's fun to watch, there's something pathetic about his tireless swats at the wire mesh.  Oy...he just upchucked purple petals all over the carpet.  Maybe that'll teach him to leave the pollen gathering to  real  bees?  Though knowing Airick, I doubt it.    urlLink

      I'm not really obsessed with German pop star David Hasselhoff, I promise.  I think Venus' transit across the sun precipitated  urlLink this story's  timely appearance.   urlLink     Ex-'Baywatch' Star Hasselhoff Arrested     LOS ANGELES - David Hasselhoff was arrested over the weekend on suspicion on driving while intoxicated, police said Monday.   The former "Baywatch" star was arrested late Saturday night on Ventura Boulevard in the Encino section of the San Fernando Valley, said Officer Sara Faden, a police spokeswoman. He was released the next morning.   No further details were immediately available.   In 2002, Hasselhoff checked himself into the Betty Ford Center for treatment of alcoholism.   The 51-year-old actor is best known for portraying lifeguard Mitch Buchannon in the long-running "Baywatch" TV series. He also starred in the 1980s television show "Knight Rider."

      Dear NPR Ombudsman:  Shame on NPR for live broadcasting  two hours  of Ray Charles' memorial service.   Last week's death of President Reagan and consequent simulcast of his memorial services were quite newsworthy events.  The death of a president and the state pageantry that surround such a funeral are historic national moments.   While I appreciate Ray Charles' contributions to music, what did NPR find newsworthy about his funeral? When the next celebrity passes, will listeners be treated to two hours of Gary Coleman's memorial service?   Please, I tune to NPR for news coverage.  If I want entertainment, I'll watch CNN or E!  Thank you.  - Jay Tifone

      I'm not a big poetry fan, but I find this one by e.e. cummings fascinating.  I remember reading it in Mr. Metherell's AP English class and completely missing the double entendre.    she being Brand  -new;and you know consequently a little stiff i was careful of her and(having  thoroughly oiled the universal joint tested my gas felt of her radiator made sure her springs were O.

      I only have nine days left at SSA, so apparently the knowledge I acquired over the past nine months of training evaporated when I put in my resignation letter.  How else to explain my new position as Professional Filer and Alphabetizer?  I've been sent up to the court claims division where I'll draw on my four years of undergraduate study, high academic achievement, and strong experiential learning to sort papers.  Yes, folks...I'm about to become Bartleby the Scrivner.  Furthermore, my boss ordered me to clear my desk out immediately.  Unfortunately, I had soooooooooooooooo much stuff (knickknacks, paddywhacks) to carefully sort through and then put away that I was completely overwhelmed and totally unable to get all of it boxed up before the end of the day.  ::dramatic sigh::  Screw you, Powers That Be! I spent today with my friends.  And typing emails.  Because once I’m moved I'll no longer have computer access, which makes me want to cry.  Word from a friend on the inside: The big boss is pissed and this demotion, and loss of a computer, is my punishment.  Chip-N-Dale (the sexual harasser big boss) invested almost $70,000 in me, both in training and salary, and he's angry that I've ditched his job to get more edjumacation.  But I get the last laugh.  I’m now burning all of my leave.  I have three day-long "doctor's appointments" in the next two weeks, plus one personal day.  So I’m only reporting to work tomorrow, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week, then Monday of the following week.  I'm angry over such shoddy treatment, but the whole situation also makes me sad.  I imagined these last two weeks would be peaceful and productive, as I worked through the remainder of my cases and also licked a few short new ones.  But Management chose to m'kay me over, so I'm reciprocating.    And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse...  As I left the building, a security guard asked to see the contents of my boxed-up personal effects.  I knew this meant trouble, but I played dumb.  Though I'd packed my "Get Fuzzy" peel away calendar, a pair of socks, and a few photos of Airick, the rest of the box contained:  ...a couple boxes of government-issued pens and pencils ...a government-issued three-hole puncher ...a government-issued two-hole puncher ...a government-issued desk calendar ...two government-issued super-sharp scissors ...a government-issued whiteout pen ...some government-issued paper clips ...a government-issued tape dispenser ...a few government-issued boxes of tape ...a government-issued stapler ...a government-issued box of staples ...a government-issued staple remover ...far too many government-issued Post-It Notes ...a government-issued index card holder.  But that's it!  The Kleenex and travel toothbrush were bought by me!  I flashed the stuff for Mr. Security, who took a quick look and then asked if I had authorization to transport all of it out of the building.  "Well, of course, I don't, doof!" I wanted to scream, while slapping the back of his head.  "If I did, it wouldn't really be screwing over my employer!"  Instead, I innocently told him I didn't know I needed authorization.  I honestly didn't.  Mr. Federal Cop sent me away, saying I couldn't leave the building until my manager filled out a Property Permission Slip.  I wish I were making this up.  I knew this was going to be problematic, so I removed the blatantly "borrowed" office supplies (hole punchers, scissors) and asked my boss for the paperwork to take home the rest.  In typical federal fashion, Richard said he'd need permission from  his  supervisor (I wish working for the government wasn't like one continuous "Dilbert" strip).  He told me to wait while he sought approval.  I'd already been demoted, forced to clean out my desk, and clocked out 15 minutes ago.  He was now wasting  my  time.  I silently fumed for the next quarter of an hour.  Richard returned with a list of excuses (my boss isn't here, no one else has authorization, I had a frontal lobotomy, etc), all of which made me want to scream.  I left the box at his desk, told him I'd get the Hall Pass (or whatever) tomorrow, and headed home.  Of course no one asked to see the contents of my lunchbag, even though I'd stuffed it with the scissors, tape, and other small office supplies.  So tomorrow I'm bringing another bag and I'm loading everything into that.  Screw this stupid redtape.  I'm tired of playing games -- I'll do that enough when I'm in Higher Ed.    Editor's Note:  Thanks to Mr. Cayle for the correct spelling of alphabetizer.  If you see him online, be sure to ask him about his vulva.

      Today I look like a 1950’s gang member.  I’ve got the styled shirt, close-cropped gelled hair, and soul patch.  Any second now I’m going to start striding down the hallway while curling my arms and snapping both hands.   urlLink     In other news, some religious nuts have been forwarding this agency-wide chain letter:       G  o  d   B  l  e  s  s   A  m  e  r  i  c  a      Subject:  Letter to President Bush   I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, for which it stands; one nation, UNDER God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Please Sign This Letter To President Bush....and Forward... Please do NOT let this petition stop and lose all these names. If you do not want to sign it, please forward it to everyone you know.  Thank you !!!   ONCE YOU HAVE CLICKED FORWARD , GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE AND PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION TO PRESIDENT BUSH THEN SEND THIS ON UNTIL THERE ARE 1000 NAMES.   THE 1000TH PERSON CAN SEND IT ON TO THE E-MAIL BELOW:   President@WhiteHouse.gov  ...............................................................   Dear President Bush, Many of us were deeply touched to hear you recite a portion of Psalm 23 in your address to this great nation in the dark hours following the terrorists attacks. We were encouraged and comforted to know that we truly had a believer working with us and for us in our nation's highest office. We, the people of America, are requesting that you lift the prohibition of prayer in schools.  As the pledge of our great country states, we are to be One nation, under God."  Please allow the prayers  and petitions of our children in schools without the threat of punishment. Currently, adults and children in the school are prohibited from mentioning God unless of course His name is uttered as part of a curse or profanity.   Madeline Murray O'Hare is dead.  Let her legacy of atheism in our schools die with her !   Sincerely, The People of America   Mark 10:13-14 "And they were bringing little children to Jesus to have Him touch them."  Jesus said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for such is the kingdom of God."      These Bible-toters are actively seeking state-sponsored religion! Of course I'm pissed off! But I tried not to let my Born Again Bashing show when I wrote this message to everyone in Social Security:     Please stop sending this.   Not only are you clogging our inboxes, you also assume that your recipients agree with your message.   I do not.   Please exercise some discretion when forwarding chain letters.     Many people wrote me expressing their appreciation.  One lady said she is praying for me.  I assume because I don't want to live in a theocracy, I'm destined for the hellfires of damnation...  Many others said I was just as guilty as the spammers because I also sent out a mass email.  That’s true, but only because someone (namely me) had to stop the stupid chain.  I’ve already been talked to by my boss, but at this point, I’m not too worried.  I’m just tired of ignorant people.  I wish I really were part of a 1950’s gang...I’d go around slashing stupid people's tires.  That’d make me feel better.

      I went back to SticksNStuff...the 3-in-1 table is actually $700 (I saw the "6" in $699 and rounded down $99...).  I also saw a simple wooden table with four chairs for $150.  Unfortunately I think I'm going to end up buying the conventional table.  But how much does that absolutely blow?! Mark said he doesn't know how to play Euchre, but I'll try and change that.  Even if we have to play on a stupid 1-in-1 table.    urlLink    Duncan Sheik is playing on Launchcast now.  In 9th grade, I wanted to  be  him.  His video for "Barely Breathing" was so cool, and I actually grew my sideburns to emulate him.  I haven't lost them yet -- does that make me an obsessive idolizer?

        urlLink    This is an honest-to-goodness pop-up advertisement I saw on Yahoo.  I don't care what your political affiliation may be...from a purely fashion perspective, wearing a hat like that is akin to black socks and sandals, or Minnie Mouse Tshirts with stretch pants.  Those combinations, like this cap, just shouldn't be done.

      Fortunately, Greg pulled me out of the apartment and took me downtown for happy hour.  We frequented a great, trendy bar in Hanover Square called World.  We met his best friend, Michael, from New York City, his partner, David, and their friends Rich and Jamie.  I felt like we were on a male Sex and the City as we sat around the street table and dished over martinis.  As soon as I got there they made me feel like one of the girls, and we had a great time.  Greg and David know everyone, and Michael is perhaps the most gregarious person I’ve ever met.  He made conversation with every person who sat on the street with us.  It didn’t take long for us to pull over a 40-something couple sitting next to us, Victoria and Fernando.  They regaled us with some hilarious stories, but perhaps the funniest thing happened when Michael spilled his drink all over his hand.  Rather than let it go to waste, Fernando grabbed Michael’s hand and began licking his fingers!  Michael is as gay as you get, a perfect fusion of Jack and Karen from Will and Grace, but to watch his look of complete shock as this straight, married guy sucked off the spilled alcohol…well, it was pretty priceless.  Or so I’m told.  David and Greg keep reminding me that all I did the entire night was giggle and smile.  And you would too if you drank seven martinis in three hours.  I’m pretty sure I now know what it feels like to be drunk.  I don’t know what it is to be buzzed – it’s not like I feel any differently – but when I stood up I felt very dizzy, and I laugh so much when I have alcohol in me.  Anyway, Frederico’s cigarette also burned me.  The guys say he was just trying to feel me up, but honestly all I felt was a short sear against my thigh, noted his cigarette, and then told him to keep his stuff away from me.  Again, I’m told I giggled over this.  Yes, friends, I paid for my over-indulgence.  At 3a, I woke up with a scanbark headache and the worst case of dry mouth ever.  It’s strange, but the words of my Alcoholic Mentor came back to me, and I heeded Kris’ advice of drinking a lot of water to rehydrate and also taking some Advil.  I did, went back to bed, and felt fine the next morning.  My first hangover, and it wakes me up.  How scanny am I?  But it was worth it.  Between watching the lesbian in pigtails shake her groove-thang, and Michael swing dance with the wig-wearing 70-year-old lady, well, I haven’t had so much fun in a long time.  It was a perfect way to start my stay in Syracuse.  And I’ll drink to that.  Or rather, I did.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while, folks.  I've been a bit busy packing for the move to Syracuse.  Though I haven't published lately, I have been writing -- I currently have four drafts in production for some pretty (I'd like to think) decent pieces.  As soon as they're polished, I'll put them up and send out the links.  In the meantime, I offer some great sites I've found while trolling the net.  Enjoy.  :)  The new  urlLink "Phantom"  trailer.  I listened to this music growing up, now I'm psyched to see the movie.  The new "Harry Potter" title is revealed  urlLink here .  According to CNN, the prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort.  It looks like  urlLink William Shatner  may do a guest spot on "Star Trek Enterprise." I wonder how the writers will pull that one off...?   Jon and I can't get enough of the two  urlLink Cheat   urlLink Commandos  cartoons.  Blue Laser cracks me up!   urlLink     "What the crap?!"

      Today I’ve felt very disconnected.  From everyone.  No net. No telephone. No email. No instant messaging. No roommate. No friends.  But especially no sense of direction.  I got lost again returning from Kmart.  I can get there just fine, however that knowledge breeds confidence in my sense of direction and knowledge of area streets.  That inevitably leads to cockiness that pushes me to explore and find a new route home.  Which is why I end up driving in circles.  I know this because I bought a $20.00 Syracuse road atlas last night at Wegmans.  So today as I wandered down Sulphur Springs Road (charming name, isn’t it?) and darted around _____ and Lime Street, I noted that while I was getting a nice tour of Lemoyne College, I was doubling back on myself.  As I’ve said many times before, there’s a fine line between curiosity and stupidity, and more often than not, I’m in the latter camp.  I guess that Magellan and Cook were intrepidly dumb, too…why else would they traverse the sea and end up wandering down Sulphur Spring Road staring blankly at their atlases?  For me, the simplest drive – perhaps 10 minutes from door to door going there – now takes around 45 minutes driving home with my “new” courage.  Which would be acceptable if I only practiced this during the day.  But of course I suffer wanderlust at all hours, including 11:30 on a Saturday night.  Heading home from Greg’s party with directions to get to his house, I figured I’d reverse the instructions and end up back at my apartment.  A right on Thompson Road getting there would be a left on Thompson Road to come home, right? Well…not quite, since I turned out of his driveway in the wrong direction.  After about 20 minutes of fudging this new course, I rang Greg.  He and the rest of the party had moved to the bar, but he wasn’t picking up his cell.  Though I felt like crap physically and mentally, and I began to panic as I drove through increasingly seedier neighborhoods, I calmly left this message:  “Hey, GJ, it’s Jay.  If you get a chance, give me a call.  Thanks.”  I willed myself to keep the fear out of my voice, like someone would do when confronting an aggressive dog.  And I thought I’d succeeded until I heard Greg’s voicemail the next day:  “Hey, Jay.  I’m sorry I missed your call.  It’s 12:30a.  I hope you’re okay; you sounded like you were lost.  Call me back.”  Way to go Jay! That pit bull would’ve mauled me.  Apparently, when my feelings are running strong, I’m pretty terrible at masking them.  This is probably why I don’t play cards for money.  Another observation I’ve made, like many others in the male species I resist asking for directions until I’m completely, hopelessly lost.  And then I’ll only ask if I’ve been driving blind for 15 minutes and I’m near-panicked.  I finally pulled into a restaurant and asked the bartender, a spunky 40-ish brunette who chomped on her gum, how to get home.  She sent me on my way with perfect directions that I never would’ve determined on my own.  In my earlier frenzied state, I’d decided that if I couldn’t find my apartment, nor make my way back to Greg’s, I’d head for Aunt Virginia’s house across town.  I’d passed 690 at least five times, and I know that takes me to her home in Camillus.  I know I need to have a better attitude about getting around, but I’m discouraged when I can’t go out for groceries without heading over the river and through the woods.  If I wanted to live in Labyrinth, I’d have moved in with David Bowie and the Muppets.  Instead I live on Waldorf Parkway, a segment of the most poorly designed byway system since Venice.  Learning the roads will come with time, I just wish I were making progress.  After four days of driving, I’m no surer of where I am then when I began.  Except when I’m driving in circles.

      I just got my Dave Fix.  The first song on Launch this afternoon was "The Song That Jane Likes." How amazing is that? I still remember cleaning construction lots for my dad during late November of 1996 and listening to "Remember Two Things" until I wore out the casette on my Walkman.  Old school DMB is still the best.  Also...what was Beezus' (from the Beverly Cleary books) real name?
