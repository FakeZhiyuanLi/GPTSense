        I'm so tired of this shit.     I thought you were different,     thought you were it.     I didnt realize you didnt 'get' me too.     Just like everyone else,     You're making me puke     up my insides all over the floor.     I'm saying it right now.     I want you no more.

          I dropped to my knees silently alone in the dark room, no one there to face except myself and.....him... Although my mind was scatter-brained my concentration remained. Slowly as I stared blankly into the reflection in the water.. I reached out to touch the image that I had built with my mind. That I had worked so hard for, Something I knew I could find. An image in the water that I knew I would not see again until my 18th year. Although I had been here for 16 years already, I had only been born at fifteen. My teeth pressed down against the corner of my bottom lip softly. I had been concentrating so hard that the blood that dripped from my lip went unnoticed into the black sea that lay before me. Straight onto the image of his nose, my favorite feature. The ripples were his demise. I felt my heart jump into my throat, as I was crouching over the pool of black water, gazing into his eyes.. I hadn't noticed that I was gone, lost somewhere. My rude awakening had come abruptly. Just like the last time we had to part. Rude and abrupt. I felt the same pain in my stomach that I had before.. As if the whole downward spiral of our tragic love had been played out again. I gasped as his image faded from the water. Gasping for air. I could not breathe again, just like before. My knees weakened and I could no longer sit on them. So I slid onto my butt slowly, reaching out to touch the cold darkness inside the water, maybe hoping that his hand would come out and touch mine. I gripped at nothing, cold wetness. I had to feel again.. I stumbled to my altar, picking up an old friend. I knew it as I sliced the wrong vein. This was the end.

      Dear you know who-  Today is your birthday.. I wish that I could call and say. How much you mean to me. I wish that I could put into words how just your voice alone weakens my knees. But I am limited to this note, and a five minute call. Im yearning to hear those Three Dots. I'm begging you mentally not to stall. I want to reach through the line and touch you. Caress your whiskered face. But the phone is the only thing there that i have left to graze. Oh and I forgot to tell you. There are some things you left behind.. The scent of your cologne on your pillowcase The memories in my head Little fragments of your heart and that lingering thought of the way you used to look right through me when you said ...dot dot dot...

            Hateful.      Why are you so FUCKING hateful?     Because I Hate you.     I hate what you've done.     I hate what you've abused.     I hate your coping skill.     I hate your substance of choice.     I hate the way you guzzle it down     Just to drown out my screaming voice.     Do you know what its like to have every tavern's phone number memorized when your five years old?      Its just another story that shouldn't have to be told.     I didn't ask to be born.     I wish they would've given me that choice.     Instead of having to sit here crying tears of scorn.     Listening to your slurring voice.     You disgust me.     Just like Scarlett.     So leave me be.     And take with you your precious Harlett.     I never needed either of you.     You never taught me shit.     I wish you would both get a clue.     Instead of sitting here, making me watch over you.     Just so that you dont pass out and die.     But never did you appreciate     The fact that 80% of the tears I cry.     Are from worry.     The anxiety that troubles me so.     Is actually from the thought of watching you both go.     I am a walking contradiction.     When in fact I am pure human.     Always wanting you to quit your addiction.     The only thing that you love.     So cling to that bottle.      And wonder why...     You have no friends.     Or true love in which to confide.     But I will always be here, codependant little me.      Always here, to take away your keys.

        You Have no Idea     How much I Yearn     to watch you Die.          You make my insides turn.     Like a bad taste in my mouth     that refuses to subside.          But why is it..     that everytime I try to hide     You come seek me out     and apologize.          But everytime im crying     You're too busy to care.     Lost in your precious television     and how could I dare     inturrupt as my spirit is dying.          And everytime I fall for your act     Your so great at making me believe     You mean it this time.          But I hate your inner soul     And I will dance on your grave.     And everytime, I think you've changed.     But tragically still your hostility remains.

            It's Like Air.     I dont want him, I need him.     It's like air.     And it's like I'm watching a movie of me drowning..     But I'm helpless to do anything about it.     It's like air.     What do you do without oxygen?     You suffocate.     That is the worst way to die..     By heartbreak.     I'm falling, But, God, I just want to hit..     The bottom of this never-ending pit.     I'm reaching out for something to grab onto.     But all that is there     is this cold wall of authority     that seperates.     and kills.     and suffocates me.

           Blue Red and Yellow Pills drop With each one my heart flips And my stomach flops I love you Doctor Forever and Always You are the perfect man You leave me staring at the screen in a daze. With your cute little green hat And the way You look at me and say.. Your lips parting ever so gently, as your voice gets deeper, so much lower. Whispering into my ear Game Over.

       Is that all I am?   A fucking number on your phone?   Push a button and forget me.      You said you were going to be the one who cared.   You always said you'd be there.      Hang me up and tell me my feelings matter.      Then tear me down passively, never to my face.      You never COULD stand to see me frown.      But that frown is the only friend I have left to chase..      -All the rest of the people in this world away like you.      I dont want to attract any more of them just so that they can pull me down      Just like you.      So as I frown...      Go on and push that button on your phone.      While I sit here,   Clutching my blade and my sanity.   Left all alone.

        Hate to Interrupt your perfect life.     Just so you can listen to me cry     -a few times     while you roll your eyes.          I know thats what your doing     locked yourself into Euphoria     what a horrid place to be     Let's all feel pity on you     But, God, Never me.          I want to slam your face into the cement          But, fuck, its not fair     that i get accused and you get consequences.          Yeah, I slit my wrists for you.     bled for you     cried for you     died inside for you          You leave me with a movie,     But i'll leave you with something you'll never forget.     A broken heart and a burnt out cigarette.

        I've been holding my breath for too long.     Drowning in this bittersweet nightmare that is you.     Everyday I wake reluctantly     Just to be forced to look through these eyes.          Once again, like everyday     Forced to hear their lies.     "Everything will be okay"     one day...     they say.     But I dont want it to be okay.     Unless it means having him back.     right now.     today.          Nothing will ever mend, truthfully.     Time does not heal, only allows you to make it part of your tedious routines.          So here I go,     turning blue.     You know I would only do this for you...

       I'll be your Catalyst.   I'll be the trigger on your gun   that makes you fly   like a bullet   into all of their eyes.   to make them see what they want to block out   They cant have me.   They wont take me without a fight.   So keep my heart.   Hold it tight.   Or just throw me away.   whatever you like.    In a world of Prevention...    I'll be your catalyst   I'll make things happen   things that they dont want.   things that you dont have the guts to say.    But I'll step up   and I'll play.   I'll be your linebacker in this risky game.   The only thing that matters now is that you're okay.   But i swear on everything that I have.   I'll be with you someday.

        Falling Deeper Into this Act     Hiding behind my Beautiful Mask     I'm Beginning to Think that This Monster I've Created is now me.     I've barricaded myself in so tightly.     No one will ever get in,     But that is how I want it.     Not because I'm afraid of you.     But, because im afraid of the things that I might do.     I would kill myself if I ruined it now.     So that's why I'm posting my sign:     No Boys Allowed     Because what I gave to you,     will never again be mine.
