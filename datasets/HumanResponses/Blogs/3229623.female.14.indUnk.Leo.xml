      Hi! its Friday thank god. I can get some much needed rest. Right now Im listening to Ozzfest Radio( go to you windows media player and click the radio tuner and search for cool radio stations and listen to them. DO IT! lol ooo! Static-X!) and sort of kind of getting ready to go and see this play at the high school. Im also trying to stretch one of my ear holes out so I can put a smaller gage of an earing in it. Anyway. Today was ok I guess. I was tired the whole damn day but whatever. Although, I did get to insult this little shit head Kevin till he didnt know what to say. That was fun. Everyone was laughing and clapping by the time I was done with him. It was great. Well Ill check back later. I have nothing better to do with my life so whatever.

      So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell Blue skys from pain Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail A smile from a veil Do you think you can tell  And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts Hot ashes for trees Hot air for a cool breeze Cold comfort for change And did you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage  How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found The same old fears Wish you were here- Pink Floyd

Im 14, my bday is august 19, 1989.Im a leo/virgo(i was born on a cusp) Umm... gezz this is hard. lol. well i was born here and have lived here all my live. i have moved once. i used to live on knob hill. now i live up in the hills by deerwood and such. not in deerwood but in that area. umm.. i play guitar and piano. though i stopped playing piano cuz our piano sux sooo much ass and i stopped taking lessons cuz my teacher scared the shit out of me. ummm... im a friendly person, maybe a little to nice sometimes. though sometimes im a little to hard on myself. i think i blame myself to much too. but yeah. umm... i love music. its a huge part of my life. rock, metal, punk, the oldies, yeah. uh.. my dad just turned 50, hes on a business trip on the east coast right now. hes a winemaker. my mom just turned 45. i love them sooo much. i couldnt ask for better parents. umm... i dont get poison oak thank god considering i live on land thats got lots of it. the only "bad" things ive really done are drink, and drink at school(ive only done it a few times) and did things mom and dad said i cant to as in ride in cars with boys, hang around town a lot, date.. etc. but my dad a wine maker so its expected(the drinking). and he give me wine and liquere(spelling?) im a pagan. i do believe in things like that actually. i have 3 cats. i love photography. i write songs when i need to get something out. i dont like sleeping alone. a cat is fine but i prefer a actual person. kinda weird huh? it just makes me feel better, not as alone. though a lot of times i just fall asleep clinging to a pillow. i usued to skateboard too, but i had to give it up. i have to many things to do. food is another passion of mine. lol im 25% italian, so its in my blood. mom had me make dinner for company one night so i must be ok at it. im better at desserts though. i can make a bad ass cheesecake, fudge, peanut brittle, toffie, creme brulette(however you say it, but its really good, but it a bitch to make) im a night person. night owl, whatever. i love the night. i get crazy at night. just ask my close friends. and lucas.... im a random person. lol i you havent seen that side of me just wait. youll see. i like to read. i wish i had more time to read though... i believe in karma.i get good grades.in clean in the drug department. or as of right now.i get my braces off thursday. well... this section is to be continued. in my future entries i will add more when things come to mind. heres another piece of my creative writing....  today i was thinking about a past summer day. one of those lazy, lay in the sun by the pool days. it was a saturday if i can remember correctly. i was laying in a lounge chair under an old, worn tree. which kind of tree, i cannot place. there was a slight warm breeze whistling though the trees, slightly shifting the leaves and blowing my hair around and onto my face and wet body where it lay, stuck. in my hand my mp3 player, which was playing the goo goo dolls Black balloon. the lyrics were swimming though my head. a song that would surly be placed on the soundtrack of my life. i stared though the the leaves of the tree over head peering into the cloudless sky, the sun blocked by one of those neatly placed leaves. for an instant time stood still. things froze in place. i blinked, and in an instant, time seemed to start again. the wind was weaving thought the leaves again,making an ineresting sound i cannot place into words. i stared into the sky, as f i was trying to look beyond it, see something that no one else had noticed before, or had even tried to notice. i looked for something deeper than just sky,an open, blue plain, of space.i didnt find anything in particular, except the sence of what heaven is protrayed to be. the calm, serene place where everyone rests in, well, peace. i blinked, and slowly, a calm smile arose on my face. i slowly lifted myself up, walked almost drunkly to the pool and slipped back into the pool slowly,step by step, feeling the water consume me slowly. i was happy, rested... no worries as they say. it was just in fact, another, calm, summer day Black Balloon Baby's black balloon makes her fly I almost fell into that hole in your life And you're not thinking about tomorrow 'Cause you were the same as me But on your knees  A thousand other boys could never reach you How could I have been the one I saw the world spin beneath you And scatter like ice from the spoon That was your womb  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder Or are you someone's prayer  You know the lies they always told you And the love you never knew What's the things they never showed you That swallowed the light from the sun Inside your room, yeah  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder Always someone  And there's no time left for losin' When you stand they fall, yeah  Comin' down the world turned over And angels fall without you there And I go on as you get colder  All because I'm Comin' down the years turn over And angels fall without you there And I'll go on and i'll lead you home and All because I'm All because I'm And I'll become What you became to me

      i just got finished burning my past life to ashes. Let me explain. today i found a bunch of my old notes that i had kept all these years.notes full of past dreams, feelings, hate, lust, sadness, happiness, events, you name it. I went out with a candle, a box over flowing with notes, (and i mean 100s of notes), and some matches. I dumped the box of notes into the fire pit, lit a few notes with the matches and watched them all burn to ashes. all the things i felt and believed in were going up in flames. i watched the smoke billow out into the night and felt, out of all things, sadness, relief  and  happiness. i wathed past events unfold in the smoke, twisting, replaying things i have forgotten. why dwell on the past? why keep all the sorrow, pain, even past happiness in mind forever? let alone, keep it till i stumble on them again and re-live those events? i was letting go. i can now say i  have  let go. i am relaxed and refreshed. i also slowly burned the pictures of those people out there i never want to see again, let alone think about again. i watched the stars and the moon, and i held my cat in my arms and kissed its head. I am content. I am at peace. blessed be, all of you.

      hello. im bored so im just gonna talk about my fave anime show,yes, Cowboy Bebop. Its so sad, but its such a great show. All the people have such sad, yet interesting lives. Its set in outer space in like, way future time.Spike Spiegel is a guy who,In his youth,was heavily involved with the Red Dragon crime syndicate.(its like a mob in a weird way), well he left the syndicate which you cant do, so he had people chasing after him to kill him. We was with the woman he truly loved,(Julia) and they were to run away together. But a guy named Vicious, who was Spikes friend was sent after Spike to kill him. Well Vicious went to Julia and told her she had to kill him or he would kill her and Spike. Well she never met up with Spike etc, and stayed on the run from Vicious(by the way Vicious is a made-man). Well years later(the 25th session) Spike and Julia met up once again and were going to run away once again. But Juila gets killed on their escape from Vicious. So now Spike has nothing to live for. So then he meets up with Vicious and he kills Vicious and Vicious kills Spike. Spikes 2nd life is now over, which is the way he wanted it.(he had "died" once before{thats when Julia left him the first time}) Well then theres Jet Black, he had his girlfriend,Alisa,and he was a cop, and one day she left him.But she was all he ever needed. wll all she left was a pocket watch. And jet promised him self, that when the watch stopped ticking, and if alisa didnt return, he would start a new life. So the watch stopped.. blah blah blah. And he bacame a bounty hunter.Faye was hyper frozen when she was about 14, and now shes about a few 100 years old and cant remember a thing about her past, and she has a huge debt to pay off from being hyper frozen. those are the sad stories.... watch the show. its on the toon network at like 12 pm or something. or ask me if you want to borrow the dvd set. lol i have them all. well bye bye all!

      yeah. hi all. i havent written in awhile, or at least it feels like it. hmm im thinking about something amanda brought to my attention. Sleeping alone. yeah, i guess sleeping alone sometimes is good. but i dont think i ever really liked it. i mean, i guess i just feel lonely. maybe i just like someone to cling to. i donno. before i met chris i didnt mind sleeping alone that much. but now... evey night i feel alone and want him next to me. i remember when we both almost feel asleep on my bed once. i was leaning against the wall, on my bed, and chris just laid down and put his head on my chest. i took off his hat and ran my fingers through his hair and closed my eyes. then we both jumped awake cuz we knew we were both drifting off. we just looked at eachother and smiled and he kissed me on the forehead if i can remember right. ooo i miss him sooo much. argh! i gotta go! bye bye

      wholy shit its a New Moon! I have shit to do! but only a few of you might have a clue what i talking about! (*cough* amanda...) anyway! i heard this song on the radio today on my way home and its one of those happy good day songs you listen too. ive heard it before and have it downloaded somewhere but yeah here it is.  Leaving Town  by Dexter Freebish    Oh, your reputations so golden You're never lonely and you're never home I know you've been talking 'bout leaving You've lost all your feelings for this town Paint your nails and put on your lipstick You don't want to miss your ticket out Just because you graduate From school so high in the Gene pool, thats your point of view  But when you're broken down And no one else is around You'll come running back to this town, And I'll be there, yeah I'll be there  'Cause I remember how we drank time together And how you used to say that the stars are forever And day dreamed about how to make your life better By leaving town, leaving town  Pack your bags, your smokes in your pocket You're wearing my locket around your neck Take a drag and wait for the Greyhound The world is your playground, and you oughta win But when you're broken down, and no one Else is around, you'll come running back to this Town, and I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there  Cause I remember how we drank time together, And how you used to say that the stars are forever And day dreamed about how to make your life better By leaving town, leaving town  Nothing in life will ever come that easy Doesn't mean it has to be that hard I know you will find out who you are..... But when you're broken down, and no one else Is around, you'll come running back to this town And I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there  'Cause I remember how we drank time together, And how you used to say that the stars are forever, And day dreamed about how to make your Life better, by leaving town, leaving town repeat 2x  My love, you're leaving town, yeah

      hey all. i hope your doing well. im not to hot. i feel like, well not myself. my body is like in crazy mode right now. i ache all over, i have bruises all over my body and i dont know where they all came from. if i twist my neck i get this weird feeling in my neck, like the bones have sand in between them and the sand is like grinding away at them. mentally im shit out of luck too. i cant think or consentrate. i feel hung over, but i havent been drinking lately, and why would i feel hung over in the middle of the day? i felt fine at school but now im just exasuted... i want to colaps. i have before. it wouldnt be the first or last time. anyway.. today i...went to the orthodontist and found out im getting my braces off in a week from tomorrow.(YES!)its about time too. thank god. now i can kiss right! *wink* uhhh... anyway... i wanted to give grant and mark rides home or wherever today, but we wernt going there way i think and i had already overflowed mom with wanted favors today. i cant wait till i can drive. i could drive people places. but theres one problem. im STILL (yes i said still) 14 damnit! so people will be giving me rides. stupid age thing. anyway. after school i found my "got skill" shirt i got for free and went outside and chilled and talked on the phone with matt. then i did my homewok(slowly if i may add) i had hardly any consentration. i think i might be getting sick. DAMNIT. will someone out there feed me chicken soup? that reminds me of when me and nate(b) were going out, i was really sick and he told me he wanted to come over and make and feed me chicken soup. lol. we was my second boyfriend, although i dont think the first one really counted. we were like, 8..lol. oh well. i think a small amount of really good boyfriends is sooo much better than lots of shitty or have ass/ ok boyfriends is a lot better. wow this is a really big entry. though nothing compared to amanda... lol. anyway about 5pm i got my guitars out and started practing the songs my band and i are going to cover. then i played stairway to heaven for anyone to sat to listen. which was, sadly, only my cat, Tigger aka badd kitty mean kitty, cutest boy in the world. lol arnt pet names just great? well im gonna go now... im sure all of you out there are sick of reading my bullshit anyway so.. take care all of you. im gonna have dinner and start a fire out in our fire pit outside and enjoy the night while its young, and look over the town right before me... bye bye all. my love to you.

Today was a pretty good day. I went swimming for 2 hours. It was fun but it got boring after awhile. I was supposed to get my picture taken for the ukiah daily journal but I was swimming.lol. So tomorrw I have to do that. Im getting a poem published. Id put it on here if I could find it. Maybe later. Yeah. I should get going. Its 5:53 and I just got home.

      Hi. Today was actually a good day. Swimming was good. It made me feel like, funny. In a good way though. It really relaxed me. I talked to a few people I usually wouldnt just cuz I was so relaxed I didnt care. It was nice. Anyway. I went to my friend Amandas sight and read her entrys, its so sad. Im sorry Amanda. She lost her dad about a year ago I think. Her entrys really made me think. Im so lucky to be  normal . To just be so lucky. Ive really been trying to not take things for granted. *sigh* Ive been really trying to be thankful for everything and its rounded me out  a   lot .Anyway. I went to guitar today. Alisa, Alison and I have started a band. Alisa and I play guitar, and Ally plays bass. My teacher, Matt, it helping us, and he just found a chick drummer for us! Shes in 7th grade! Oo! Thats so cute. I think Ill like her. I hear shes very open with music. Thats good. But yeah. The band is going slow at the moment only cuz we dont have the place to practice. But once the School Of Music moves into a bigger place(in June they will) we will have the space and time. Its sooo cool. I cant wait to get really started. The only thing thats bothered me today is that I dont know how chris is doining. I think Ill call when Im done here. Im worried. But I cant help it. I just care  so  much.... when you love someone to my extent of loving him, you get worried really easily. But its in my nature to worry. I cant help it. Well Im going to go call him and watch cowboy bebop. see ya

      I wanted to add just one more song for today. I love this song and I love bob dylan. Hes one of the greatest song writers of ALL time. *sigh*  Not Dark Yet Shadows are falling and I've been here all day It's too hot to sleep time is running away Feel like my soul has turned into steel I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal There's not even room enough to be anywhere It's not dark yet, but it's getting there  Well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain Behind every beautiful thing there's been some kind of pain She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind She put down in writing what was in her mind I just don't see why I should even care It's not dark yet, but it's getting there  Well, I've been to London and I've been to gay Paris I've followed the river and I got to the sea I've been down on the bottom of a world full of lies I ain't looking for nothing in anyone's eyes Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear It's not dark yet, but it's getting there  I was born here and I'll die here against my will I know it looks like I'm moving, but I'm standing still Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer It's not dark yet, but it's getting there.

      Hello. It was an ok day today. unlike yesterday. Chris, I hope things get better for you. You  dont  deserve to be down. I miss you. Love you all.   I Miss You  Hello there, the angel from my nightmare the shadow in the background of the morgue the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if we want where you can always find me we'll have Halloween on Christmas and in the night we'll wish this never ends we'll wish this never ends  I miss you, miss you I miss you, miss you  Where are you and I'm so sorry I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight I need somebody and always this sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time and as I stared I counted webs from all the spiders catching things and eating their insides like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason will you come home and stop this pain tonight stop this pain tonight  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you) don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  I miss you, miss you I miss you, miss you I miss you, miss you I miss you, miss you-  Blink 182

      I watch the western sky The sun is sinking The geese are flying south It sets me thinking  I did not miss you much I did not suffer What did not kill me Just made me tougher  I feel the winter come His icy sinews, Now in the firelight The case continues  Another night in court The same old trial The same old questions asked The same denial  The shadows closing round Like jury members I look for answers in The fire’s embers  Why was I missing then That whole December? I give my usual line, I don’t remember  Another winter comes His icy fingers creep Into these bones of mine These memories never sleep And all these differences A cloak I borrow We kept our distances Why should it follow that I must have loved you?  What is a force that binds the stars? I wore this mask to hide my scars What is the power that moves the tide? Never could find a place to hide  What moves the earth around the sun? What could I do but run and run and run? Afraid to love, afraid to fail A mast without a sail  The moon's a fingernail And slowly sinking Another day begins And now I'm thinking  That this is indifference Was my invention When everything I did Sought your attention  You were my compass star You were my measure You were a pirate's map Of buried treasure  If this was all correct The last thing I'd expect The prosecution rests It's time that I confessed I must have loved you I must have loved you-Sting

      I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      Its Sunday. Tomorrows Monday. Testing starts then. Goodie. Life isnt really exciting for me anymore. Its really sad. Theres nothing for me to look forward to. I mean, besides summer, something close. Like when I plan to go somewhere with one of my friends over the weekend, or when Chris comes up, or even guesses when he can come up, or something like shopping or a play...the movies... I need shit to do. Something exciting and new. Oh god that rhymed... *sigh* what to do, what to do... I COULD clean my room, but I dont really feel like it. Im so lazy sometimes. I want to call someone. I dont know who though. Someone I havent talk to in awhile. Ah who cares anymore. Well Im gonna stop bitching and go. Bye bye.

      *sigh* I love you Chris. Please visit me soon.  Thank You *if the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you. When mountains crumble to the sea, There will still be you and me.  Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more. Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, Tears of loves lost in the days gone by. My love is strong, with you there is no wrong, Together we shall go until we die. My, my, my, an inspiration is what you are to me, Inspiration, look see. And so today, my world it smiles, Your hand in mine, we walk the miles, Thanks to you it will be done, For you to me are the only one. Happiness, no more be sad, Happiness....I’m glad.-Led Zeppelin

           well i just got done having an emotional breakdown. fun huh? i mean, just to much is going on for me to handle and i cant remember anything at all. im just soo stressed out. im loosing my hair from the stress and part mal-nutrition. i take vitamins but i guess its not enough. isabella has  her  music blasting thought the house and its driving me crazy and insain.britney spears and rap. mom wont tell her to turn it down, and my say doesnt matter in this house anyway so its not like i can really do anything.      i got home, and things just... well.. fell apart. i walked down to my favorite tree and just flat out cried. then one of our cats, my cat, my little boy, tigger followed me all the way to my spot to rub against me. that made me cry even harder. i just picked him up, put him in my lap and buried my face in his fur. i try to be this happy go lucky girl all the time but sometimes i just break down... i mean, i come off as this happy go lucky girl all the time, or most of the time, or so im told, and its quite a mask i wear. i mean, yeah i am happy a lot of the time, but sometime i dont feel like being happy but i dont think its fair to others to be all sad and bring them down with my sad attitude. well anyway back to my story i was sitting with tigger, my tears dampining his fur, then i looked up and a tear ran down my cheek onto my lips. i licked my lips and tasted that salty taste of tears once again. then mom yelled at me to get up and said she wanted to talk to me. all she really did was bitch at me. it made me cry even harder but i sucked up my tears and did what she told me to do. she told me i cant run away from everything and i said yes i can and walked onto the porch and just let it all out. i sat on the steps, wrapped my arms around and under my thighs, and put my head on my lap. sure my pants had numerous tear stains, but who the fuck really cares? after i let it all out i calmed down and just sucked it all up. i cant wait for tomorrow. friday. TGIF. what i would give to just relax and not worry about anything. i want it to be friday so i can be happy and not worry about my future and everthing i have to get accomplished. i want it to be tomorrow so i can have dinner with grant, eat good food and be happy and relax! i want it to be tomorrow so i dont have to feel like im in a fucking hurry all the time. those of you out there who do nothing have it nice. to relax is a gift. did i mention that compputer careers suck? and that the only reason we have to take that class is to scare the FUCKING SHIT OUT OF YOU so you do better in high school to think to yourself if i get good grades i can go to college and get a good job and make enough money to live. thats what that class is for. to  SCARE  you out of your fucking mind. arnt i right? but thats only one of my problems. sorry about all this... i needed to vent..  why is there pain in the world? why to make the good times seem all the more golden.  why is there so much noise? why to make the silence more apriciatable.  whats the meaning of life? why no one knows untill they die, but whats the fun of knowing the point at the very beginning?  is death really all that bad? there are worse things to do to someone you love than kill them.  why cant we all be perfect? we would have nothing to complain about with ourselves or anything to shoot for.  why is it that people believe in a god and or a goddess? why some people need something to believe in this world since there is hardly anything to believe in.  is there really such a thing as a sure thing or a promise? of course not. never. everything is subject to change.  why do we have two ears but only one mouth? someone out there want us to listen twice as much as we speak.  but remember... dont believe everything you read....

      look at the EFFECTS at the bottem to find out why!  Grind 6 nutmeg nuts (approx 30g or 1 ounce) into a powder. I use a coffee grinder. If you don't have strainer just break the nuts into large chunks using a mortal & pestle. I reccommend grinding.  Now chuck this into 750 ml of water (3 cups) and simmer without boiling over a stove for 1 hour. The water will be reduced by about 30% so your end result will be approx 500 ml of tea.  After the one hour strain the nutmeg out and let the tea cool. Then sweeten w/ honey (play around with this to see what you like best) and drink.   Note: **IMPORTANT** Do not cool the tea down to where it is noticably cold (test it with your finger). If it is noticably cold, and there is a white precipitate on the sides of your cup re-heat the tea and re-dissolve the white precipitate. You will only get minimal effects if you don't pay attention to this.  Sources: Getting nutmeg is very easy, but getting it cost effectively might be a bit trickier. Get only whole nutmeg, don't waste your time with the pre-ground stuff. If you get your nutmeg at the supermarket it will probably be about $5 / 1.5 oz. This is ok I guess, but if you search out your local herb stores you can find prices (at least in my area) that are about $1/ oz.   Effects: They begin within 15 minutes and last (estimated) 3 or 4 hours.  It is very similiar to cannabis ... its even legal!!! so make some tea today!!

      hey. i hope you all are well out there. im ok. today has been one of those very calm relaxing days. at least for the most part. i cooked quite a bit today. for the tast of redwood valley thing. yeah. it sux cuz mom and dad are out for dinner and i am starving, cuz all the food in the house i cant eat. its for the tasting. well i could make something, i can cook. better than the 90% of the teenage population, or so im told. right now i want to cook a steak, but the grill has no gas... damnit. ahhh.. oh well. lol. right now im listening to incubus if you couldnt tell. they are awesome. but yea. i dont really have anything to do either, not that i know of. but i rented kill bill today. chris said that i would probally like it so yeah. its intreagued me forever so hell... i had an interesting talk with mark on the phone today/ tonight. we talk about anything and everything. yeah, but i wont get into it. this has been a busy week. just with school and all. it takes all the energy out of me. when i get home im soo tired. its crazy. if i dont have a cold coffie or something i fall asleep. when i tug along with mom and bella to walmart i almost fell asleep standing up when they were looking at clothes!! lol. righr now im really tired and want to sleep. but i cant. its friday. it against my rules to go to bed early on fridays. well anyway i went swimming again today, but mom said we could pick any of my friend up cuz we were only staying a short while. so i was like, noooooo! but whatever. i just sat in the pool and watched bella swim. lol the lifeguard thought i was 18 or 16. lol. when she said 18 im like umm... try subtracting four years! lol she laughed and said well you look a lot older! i said thankx, but then thought, is looking older a good thing? lol. today i also got to play guitar a lot. it was great. i took my shirt off and went outside in the yard and played. then tigger(one of our cats..(my cat) ) came up and rubbed his head against the small of my back. and it made me happy to know one of the animals in our house likes me. lol. ahh well im gonna go. take care. i love you guys. and here is another song to read to keep you busy. its one of my favorite songs from incubus. in the very biginning you hear wales... it sooo cool... its got this flowing cool softer sound... The Warmth  by Incubus  I'd like to close my eyes and go numb, But there's a cold wind coming from, The top of the highest high rise today. Its not a breeze 'cuz it blows hard, Yes and it wants me to discard, The humanity I know, watch the warmth blow away...  CHORUS So don't let the world bring you down, Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold. Remember why you came and while you're alive, Experience the warmth before you grow old.  So do you think I should adhere, To that pressing new frontier, And leave in my wake, a trail of fear, Or should I hold my head up high, And throw a wrench in spokes by, Leaving the air behind me clear?  CHORUS So don't let the world bring you down, Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold. Remember why you came and while you're alive, Experience the warmth before you grow old. (x2)  Before you grow old... Where did it go ? (x4)

      To see you when I wake up Is a gift I didn't think could be real. To know that you feel the same as I do Is a three-fold, utopian dream.  You do something to me that I can´t explain. So would I be out of line if i said I miss you.  I see your picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow, next to mine. You have only been gone ten days But already I´m wasting away.  I know I´ll see you again Whether far or soon. But I need you to know that I care And, I miss You. (i miss you) ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

      hello. im back again. my morining is starting to get better, though im not all the way there yet. i feel so angry at myself for soing certian things. like the cecil thing... while we talked, while he said he really liked me, he was just out with him girlfriend who he never really broke up with(which i later found out), screwing her and telling her he loves her, yet telling me he likes me a lot and planning a day out for the two of us. meanwhile the person who i truely love is chushed and upet miles away. "there are worse things you can do to a person you love than kill them."-lullaby. but let me tell you all the whole story.. it was homecoming. i was happy and just got off the freshman float. mom picks me up and drives me home for some food and pictures. those pictures are my favorite pictures i have of myself. right before i fuck up big time. HUGE. i got to the football game which i didnt even bother watching. i met kyles friend cecil there. and right now kyle is in tha same roomwith me. i thought cecil was cute and there was just something about him, i just could tell what it was though. but we hit it off. we walked to the park with maya, rachel, adam, and kyle. we sat on a bench together and talked. i was cold. he told me to use his pockets to keep my hands warm, so i did. well, we looked at eachother they way people do in movies when they kiss, but i turn away. he asked whats the matter? i said i was nervous. i usually arnt around guys i like, but with you its different. he said oh...and stared ahead like i was. he said sorry about that. i want to kiss you but i cant. i just got my lip pirced. he did. so then pur friends started leaving the park so we left too. we walked to the tri ans then walked down in it. he sat on the high ledge abd pulled me forward into his legs and hugged me. we had told me a lot about him and he was happy for that. both his parents are disabled now from a car wreck, hes dislexic(spelling) and they are on welfare, and much more. he looked at me again and then kissed me. it wsa very messy i must admit that. but with a new lip right i think it probally shoulf be. we walked around more blah blah blah. then we had to leave cuz the dance was over. (yeah it was a dance too) but when i got home i laid on the couch and felt sick to my stomach. i wanted to puke.i had forgotten about chris and the fact that we were kinda sorta bf and gf. we werent going out at the time, but even if we were i would have still felt just as bad. who needs technecalities? well the next night i confessed and he was crushed. but he said he had no right to be mad cuz we werent really together. i said no he should be. and thats when i left and didnt talk to him. in that time where i didint talk to chris, cecil told me he liked me blah blah blah, he told me he cut himself a year ago and almost died. then later he said he and his gf were back together and i probally think hes a douche bag. i said no, he has every right to do so and im not mad. then he said not to tell her about him cutting himself. she didnt know. A GIRLFRIEND OF A YEAR, A YEAR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! DIDNT KNOW SOMETHING THAT TOOK ME 6 DAYS TO FIND OUT???? thats what confused me, but wait. his gf calls me, tells me off, etc. i hang up and never hear from her again. THEY NEVER BROKE UP IN THE FIRST PLACE! i was lost confused everything. i was then talking to chris again building our realtionship back up. i didnt dare talk about cecil with him but damn, was i lost. chris even took me back. he said something like, i love you to much to let you go.  boy did that kill me from the inside out. boy, did i regret everything. i still regard chris as a saint. cecil ive always wondered if he ever really cares. but it doesnt matter anymore. i want to meet him one last time. the 2nd time. just so i can end things on an even level. stop my wondering. ask him some questions. tie up loose ends. thats it. i havnt talked to cecil in... 7 months i think. thank god. i still get news on him though. friends of mine know him, his friends etc. thats the story. FUCKED UP AY? yeah.. anyway. i should post this post. its getting long. and to think, this was all brought on by a cd.  taking back sunday  "the blue channel" and i'm not so sure if i'm sure of anything, anymore so this is the last night that you'll be keeping secrets from me  hit the lights before you leave, you know of the million things you had to say sorry just just might have found its way in there somehow, someway but dont worry sweetie cause i already know  and im not so sure if i'm sure of anything, anymore and this is the last night (this is the last night) that you'll be keeping secrets from me  you're so guilty it's desgusting he's been sneaking underneath your sheets your hands in places that they probably shouldnt go but dont worry sweetie, cause i already know  regardless, my pictures well they dont line your mirror regardless you know that (i'll still wait for your call) regardless, my pictures well they dont line your mirror regardless you know that (i'll still wait for your call)  honestly, this is the last time that i'll see you (i'll still wait for your call) do you know what your girl's been up to?

      ... i woke up to the radio. the bad dreams still flooding though my head. im tired, though  i got 7 1/2 hours of sleep. ever wonder why your tired after dreams? this morning bites so hard. im tired. i accudently got in the shower. i wasnt thinking obviously. got out and was like fuck. i took a shower last night... and i dont even have time to take one. so then im getting dressed, and i put a cd in my sterio, i like music in the morning, it wakes me up. well the only thing close is taking back sunday. i dont listen to them anymore cuz whenever i listen to them i get depressed because thats the cd that helped me though the time of chris and cecil. all of the songs i can pull put out a moment of something that happened at that time. it was the soundtrack of my life at that time. this morning bites hard. i want out. summer school is ok. i need to talk to someone. erek is probally one of the only ones who will truely listen to me there. i finished lullaby. im reading it twice, you have to to get the book totally. well i have to go. school calls. ill be back in about 2 1/2 hours. bye

      hello. i really dont know what to say but i think i will just ramble about stuff that just comes to mind. plus i need to practice my free hand typing. so yeah. i hope all of you out there are ok. im hungery if anything. oh well thats what i get for not eating this morning. but yeah.what sounds good to eat.... i have no clue. but i will probally go home and eat cereal out of the box like i always do...heres a song by NIN! i love these guys... even if your not to fond of them you have to give them credit for the, well, the way they put everything together is genious. did i spell that right? lol well im not one sooo yeah. here is "THE FRAGILE"She shines In a world full of ugliness She matters When everything is meaningless  Fragile She doesn't see her beauty She tries to get away Sometimes It's just that nothing seems worth saving I can't watch her slip away  I won't let you fall apart (x4)  She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by Hoping someone can see If I could fix myself i'd - but it's too late for me  I won't let you fall apart (x4)  We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side ...but they keep waiting ...and picking and picking and picking and picking...  It's something I have to do I won't let you fall apart I was there, too I won't let you fall apart Before everything else I won't let you fall apart I was like you I won't let you fall apart-NIN  yep there is one of my favorite songs by NIN. so anyway. more mindless typing is on its way. no one has to read this post its just so i can type and get better at tying free hand and to take up time etc. i hope i get paid for working this weekend. that would be great. and hopefully i can get someone to take me to redwood valley cellers so i can visit grant and "boss" him around. lol hey! talking about grant.. if your out there.. are you gonna be in town thursday??(tomorrow?) cuz if you are do you want to catch dinner as "they" say? oco time! did i spell that right? i think so.. and so does maya... but i guess ill just call you about it. lol mmmm... an oco sounds sooo good! and a japanese soda! grant your trying one when we go. whether it be tomorrow or whenever...lol. hmm you know im in computers right now, and im not doing my work cuz im already like 3 days ahead and i dont feel like doing more work. though maya is like done with everything! i have about 23 more lessons... thats about... 3 to 4 lessons a day.. hell i cando it. thats easy. or so i think.  hey grant.. one more thing... i got 4 more people into blogger..lol isnt it crazy how one person can now something, then by spreading the word about that one thing.. people tell other people.. blah blah blah blah.... you know this world is a funny thing if you ask me.you know in 100 years or so our lives are going to mean nothing. no one is probally going to remember us and what we learned and acomplished in our life.i remember asking my boyfriend, chris, once, what do you think the meaning of life is? he said he had no clue i think, but told me that when we die we find out. maybe it is pointless. maybe the meaning is just to live. who knows. maybe its stupid. maybe thats why we find out when we die. maybe if we knew what the meaning of life was some people out there wouldnt want to live. but then again, if the reason was a good one, it might compell others to live instead of killing themselves. but i dont know. it al a mystery to me. but its supposed to be. to everyone. there are more questions than answers by far. why was/were "god/gods" created? why am i here? am i here just because im here? is everything in our lives planed out like a book? unfolding as we go on living out our daily lives? what would not have been if i hadnt been born? if someone did create the human race(creationism) why? wouldnt it be easer to just not have made anything at all? boy... my brain hurts. well... why do we as humans strive to make money and become rich and famous? what compells us to do so? what makes us want to be "beautiful" "handson" etc.? how do we feel things emotionally? when some we love doesnt love you back, what makes us feel that certain pircing pain in our hearts? i donno. my mother told me that i see things different than any other person she knows. that my mind is made up more complex than tones of others. she told me i should be an artist or some sort. photography would be good she said. but i have to go. bye bye.

      you know ive always wondered why us human beings would rather expirence physical harm in the place if emotional heartbreak etc.any day of the week. but i think today i figured it out... when we get hurt, we know we are goning to heal. we get scar tissue which makes that area stronger. mentally its different. we dont know when or how long its going to take to heal. we have Dr.s for those things but those Dr.s suck major ass. we dont really have any reassurance that we are going to get totally better unlike getting hurt physicly. when we get hurt that way we are assured we will get better in no time. or some time at least. think about it. oh yeah go out and buy Lullaby by chuck palahniuk. (he wrote fight clue) its an awesome book. i got it today.. well goodnight

AHHHH!!! i couldnt feel my wrists after that class. but anyway i came home tired for some reason and chilled on the couch till i fell asleep. i fell asleep  for about 2 hours. probally more. when i woke up i was sooo fucking hot.mom and bella were gone and i like couldnt breathe and  my stomach was like caving in and when i got up i blacked out and fell back over onto the couch.  so i got up again, slowly this time, and got some water to drink. it was crazy. still i dont feel well. i want to curl up in some cold corner somewhere and die. i feel lite headed and such. i cant really feel myself walking either...lol. im a wreck. i should go take a cold bath and watch another movie. theres nothing better for me to do around this damn house. i hope tomorrow goes better than today. which sux ass is that every day its getting hotter and hotter. summers a bitch sometimes. ooo well. take care all. wish me no typing dreams.(my teacher said yes we will have dreams about typing and the computer eating your face. dont worry. theres only 2 weeks of typing....)....... bastard

      WARNING~content maybe depressing~ im back! oooo gezz where to start. well ill make some things simple. well first off the concert was so fun. the bands were good. i mean just being there was fun. (all the drugs, alcohol, food, sex and rock and roll you want) lol. davey from afi DJ'd. it was cool. we hung in SF today. that was fun too. but hmm... what else to talk about... well on the way there i was unusually depressed at random parts on the drive there. i was listening to my music on my mp3 and i would cry at random times. but no one could tell cuz i would face my window in the very back seat. i cried about 5 times there and once on the way back home. one time... we were driving past the SF airport... i was listening to... some sad song and i wasnt happy already... the planes looked so inviting. i wanted to jump out the car door, run across the freeway, jump all the fences, and somehow get myself onto a flight somewhere, anywhere... i bent forward, wrapped my arms around my legs, looked out the window and cried siently. sure my jeans had tear spots but i made sure to cover those up. in that moment, nothing sounded better then leaving this side of the world and not coming back for awhile. thats what i love about traveling. you just get away for awile and escape YOUR world for awhile. i think i have an idea why i was so sad though on the trip. actually about the whole trip i was depressed in a happy kind of mood(is that possible?) i remember ira said to me,"it looks like you could just die" but i think the thing was ira and alisa all over eachother... i mean, it bugs me that they just make out anywhere, anytime. i mean, it will be the 3 of us in alisas room and they will just decide to make out right there. i mean they do that a lot when im with them. i love them both so much but that just makes me want to die. alisa, when she does that, makes me feel like im invisible...or like i have no importance. i mean, kyle was with me to keep me company sometimes... but im sure hes not to happy about those times either.i mean, i can handle people making out on movies and people making out in public places... put when its like 3 people in a room and two of them are making out? that makes you want to die. or when i went to the movies with them friday night... it was just the 3 of us... again... i think the one thing that really gets me is that i have someone who loves me, someone who i love, who i can never see, who i cannot express my love to without words, is there in my life. to know that your loved, and that you love them back, but are never able to see them, or show your love physicly, is to me, harder than not having someone at all. i have so much love to give, but no one to give it to without being disloyal. im so full of love that i dont know what to do it just passes though me... and to see who happy i  could  be, and how happy i  could  make someone, etc right in front of me just kills me deep down inside. like... imagine an apple and a thin, but good sized knife...apple representing my heart... and every time the whole making out in front of you thing happens or something that bothers you, you slide the knife into the apple a centameter... you know what ive done with that apple? ive stabbed the whole fucking knife though the apple and stuck the knife into a wooden table all in one fluid motion. to just sit there till the apple rots off the knife and decinagrates! mr bown kind of joked around that inside im an angry person. maybe i am. im not to that point yet where i snap and go crazy though... yet... i donno. ive stopped hanging around lisa and ira for that reason. they still havent figured out why i left them. still... of course i still love them. its a painful love. i left kissing them both on the cheek and walking right though the door with a frown on my face. maybe one day they will figure it out. or maybe i will just have to yell at them. ahh i dont want to talk anymore... bah... i want my stuffed tiger... bye

      ~stuck in the rain~ i just got back from outside. outisde it happened to be raining. i love the rain. although at times it gets depressing, i think rain is a beautiful thing. to me rain is one natural thing that cleans the area in more way than one. like a fresh start. i puton my cloak and then i sat out on a stone a little away from the top of our hill. it was nice to feel the rain hit my face and fall on my lips. im a very sensual type of person so things like that i enjoy.i looked over the calm valley and smiled. im on top of the world. today has had an interesting aura. no doubt about that. i think i just figured out what it was though. this type of day reminds me of when me and nate b. were going out. interesting huh? i dont really want to do anything. but i have to. study and clean. whoop de do.(i throw my hands in the air) argh. well i shoud be going. bye bye all.

      ~Timing Is Everything~  just a few minutes ago i walked in to the office to shut off my yahoo radio. (its bad ass. its free and you edit who you want to listen to and who you dont. its soo cool) but i walked in to turn it off and who was playing but blink 182s I Miss You playing. my mouth dropped, my eyes widened, and shivers ran up my spine, down my legs and up my arms. i felt like i wanted to cry. but i wouldnt let myself considering mom and dad already think theres something wrong with me. that song has affected me in such a way there are no words that describe it. to me its such a beautiful song, though it gives me that insecure feeling i havent felt since childhood. anyway... ~To the lake and back~  another thing that happened... today me and my little sis walked to the lake... it was nice to get out of the house and walk.(not to mention think) it was nice to lean my head back, close my eyes, walk, and let the sun kiss my face. in the direction we were heading there were no clouds, just blue skys ahead. looking at the mountains gave me a thought. wouldnt it be quite something to just walk across the country with one of your friends? just walk and walk untill you reached the other side of the country... how long would it take? how much money would it take?(not that it matters that much) think of the time you would spend with that person. imagine how well you would know them at the end of the journey. imagine the stories you would be able to tell after you made it back home. wouldnt that be something?

      DREAMS(BUT BY THAT I MEAN NIGHTMARES) This morning I woke up with a jolt, like I do with every bad dream. Except this morning was a little different... I woke up not knowing who I was, why I had woken up, why I was here, why music was playing, or where I was... It was so  weird .(if you could even use that) Maybe it was the mexican food I had for dinner... maybe it was the movie I was watching till I fell asleep... maybe it was the alcohol I had at dinner. I have no idea. But in that one moment I knew what it really was to feel lost and confused. Not only lost and confused, but  scared . I got the feeling I get when I listen to the Mars Volta. That weird, entrancing feeling that draws you in. That feeling-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach feelings. The sick tension that makes you feel sick inside. The feeling that your heart knows something your brain doesnt know, let alone, has a clue about. Well about a minute of being  lost , I realized where I was and what i was doing. But i know I will never forget this morning. It was just... to mind blowing...

      hello! i hope your all doing well! im pretty good. though im lonely at the moment. today was an interesting day. as usual. but today was different. i was so much happier and laid back. i wasnt stressed out like yesterday, i had an emotional break down then... but yeah. today was a lot better. and i learned a lot about a person that i really care about today too. things i would have never known unless they had told me. i dont know if they want their name here so ill keep it hidden. there was definatly more to that person than meets thee eye as they say. i knew that the moment i started to get to know them better. its amazing what people go though. people i say i have gone though a lot. but i dont think thats quite so anymore. heres something about my past, some more about me... i had a shitty childhood as some of you know. heres some more things on it in depth... my neighbors killed me from the inside out. they destroyed my ego and liking of myself like the ocean destroying a little sand castle. they teased me, called me awful names i dont even want to think about, they imbarsed me in anyway possible, the hurt me physicly and mentally, they were rude and had no values what so ever. they day i finally became happy again slightly was the day they moved away. that SAVED me. it really did. what else about my childhood... i had guy problems when i was little. yeah.. sad huh? that hurt me a lot also. i was a shy little girl. hardly any friends. but i was pretty happy and thats all that mattered. though famliy was dying off, and i was still unstable. though i was blessed in the fact that i had a good family, and good friends( the ones that i had) i was stupid. yeah. well, 7th grade was kind of shity to. i didnt know who i was for the longest time, most of the year was just one big blur. i blocked it out. i cant remember anything. except mayra and jenny. they are the ones responsable for my pieces being put together. like humpty dumpty! but, uh.. a better turn out! 8th grade was one of my better years but i had my fuck ups as well!  put im not gonna go there right now. but for me, this year has been the best, i have learned a lot about who i am, and about what things really matter, and what things dont. i leaned a lot of important things from my god sis as well. she almost died this year, a bike accident in which her head was split open etc. she and i talked about it and life and she said, it doesnt matter what you wear, it doesnt matter what people think about you, as long as you have good friends, good family, and get ok grades, your doing fine. if not great. she said, when you almost die, realization of life kicks in. and im sure its true. ive almost died a few times myself. and the weird thing was it was all in the water. there have been numerous times in the ocean where i was body serfing and i got swept under for a long period of time where i think im about to drown. but eventually i end up getting to the serface or end up getting swep onto the shore.oo and it was always in hawaii too! gezz... im going there this summer... maybe i shouldnt body serf this time. i dont want to die. my great uncle lives there, so we visit them, and dad does work. so its a working vacation. oh heres something i didnt tell that person today, about this year. well i had a one night stand with a guy i really cared about, but he didnt live here, and he had a girlfriend which i later found out so that didnt work. he really liked me to, but hell, he liked her more. he didnt have a so great life himself but she didnt care... yeah, also, i got, well, i guess you could call it molested(not raped) on new years eve. what a great night for that huh? well by that time i was going out with chris and i spent the next morning on the phone balling and telling him what happened. that made me feel a little better, but the wound hasnt totally healed yet. he used to go to UHS but hes down in the la area now so hopefull i wont see him anytime too. i hope chris doesnt see him ever cuz he will kill him or get himself in trouble. yeah hes a trouble maker. lol. hes a bad ass. but hes a really very sweet guy for being a bad ass. i still have all these cards and emails etc. from him. i havent seen him in about, oh, 107 days i think. weve been so busy with our own lives... not to mention we have our parents who dont know about "us" and who wont drive up to eachothers towns to see eachother. but soon im sure. we have kept our relationship uo for alomost a year now, so, i find great accomplishment in that considering most people couldnt stand it. wow im really spilling my guts here... heres more random stuff about me.. ~ Im 5'5" about... ~im 25% italian, and parts of dutch, swedish, irish, german, and others ~im a pagan. my grandma was a jew, and my grandpa was italian christian, so they just decided to raise their kids to be good people etc. ~i have 3 cats ~i cant fall asleep without clutching someone or something, my pillow, a stuffed animal, a blanket, etc. its just.. i donno. a lonelyness thing. ~i play guitar and piano(kinda)

      I have been listening to Something Corporate lately. Its been awhile since Ive listened to them. But some of their songs have saved me that thats for sure. Everything I put in bold has some meaning to me, just to let you know.   Hurricane by Something Corporate  Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake I think I'm on the edge of something new with you Shout out, don't drown the sound I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud As I want to scream with you  Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing my face as I'm dying to figure out a girl  But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast So maybe I should stay and map around your world So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me And you can't explain How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane Into your hurricane Stand up don't make a sound, your ears might bleed There's sweet fluorescent enemies that live inside of me  The world moves faster than I knew, not fast enough To not creep up on you and the space we put between  So pull me under your weather patterns Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter Because a sun burns what I needed So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me And you can't explain How the wind went and pulled you into the hurricane Into the hurricane  You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake  Now I count the hours until you wake With your babies breath Breathe symphonies  Come on sweet catastrophe   Well maybe this time I can follow through I can feel complete, stop paying dues Stop the rain from falling keep my ocean calm This time I know nothings wrong  So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me And you can't explain How the wind went and pulled me in and no You Don't Say, These currents are still killing me And you can't explain How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane Into your hurricane, into your hurricane   Cavanaugh Park by Something Corporate  At Cavanaugh Park Where I used to sit All alone in the dark And dream about things That I cannot say  You always said destiny Would blow me away And nothings gonna blow me away  At Cavanaugh Park Where you used to take me To play in the sand And said to me son One day you'll be a man And men can do terrible things Yes they can  There was never any place For someone like me To be totally happy  I'm running out of clock And that ain't a shock Some things never do change Never do change At Cavanaugh Park We used to get high Watchin teams as they fought They loved my friend Adam But he always got caught Man that kid made fucking up look cool Aren't we all so cool now, No  There was never any place For someone like me To be totally happy  I'm running out of clock And that ain't a shock Some things never do change Never do change Never do change Never do change Never do change At Cavanaugh Park Where I used to think That this life would be good And I would do things That I thought that I should And no ones going to tear me down  There was never any place For someone like me To be totally happy  I'm running out of clock And that ain't a shock Some things never do change  There was never any place For someone like me To be totally happy  I'm running out of clock And that ain't a shock Some things never do change Never do change Never do change Never do change Never do change   Fall by Something Corporate   I close my eyes Thought I was lost but I was stranded  I go outside To my surprise the sky had landed  I thought it made more sense If I could only keep you guessing I was a fool to think That I should stop you from undressing Now I'm believing all the words you say That I can't say back to you  To you  So I fall  I don't want to feel this small  You know I just can't handle this Handle this at all And I'll just fall I let my heartbeat drop I faulter as the music stops And you watch me as I stall  And wonder when I fall    I kiss your neck I feel you breathing on my shoulder Still I'm perfect It must be you cause now it's over    I was so close  That was the most that I have ever been through  Now old cassettes and cigarettes Will be the ones to save you    How can you ask for me to stay When all you ever do is go? Just go    So I fall I don't wanna feel this small  You know I just can't handle this Handle this at all So I fall  I let my heartbeat drop I faulter as the music stops And you watch me as I stall wonder when I  Go on You've kept me waiting Go on  And watch me as I fall I don't want to feel this small  You know I just can't handle this Handle this at all And so I fall  I let my heartbeat drop I faulter as the music stops And you watch me as I stall And wonder when I   Good News by Something Corporate   She's trapped inside her room With reruns on the screen  Old books and movies  But she can't stop thinking I'm torn between myself My radio my friends I want to write this one off over and over and over again  And then she looked at me to scream My castles are falling But I can't look into the street Without everything changing I want to read good news, good news  I want to be innocent again  I want to read good news, good news But nothing good is happening  She waits all day She stands a stranger in her skin  She moves the science with her hands She lines the walls With every paper she can see  These words consume her But they never set her free  And then she looked at me to scream My castles are falling But I can't look into the street Without everything changing I want to read good news, good news  I want to be innocent again  I want to read good news, good news But nothing good is happening But nothing good is happening But nothing good is happening I want to read good news, good news  I want to be a little kid again  I want to read good news, good news But nothing good is happening I want to read good news  I want to go to sleep at night again  I want to read good news, good news But nothing good is happening But nothing good is happening But nothing good is happening   You're Gone by Something Corporate   Taking steps back through the words I should've said to you They all got lost, you went away Well I feel sick, and you just don't care anymore, anymore  Hours to be with you Minutes of me in you  And I cant feel this happening So tie my hands back, and make me feel you coming down  I'm coming down And you don't care Your face is on a billboard And you're everywhere You don't care much for interviews  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you've gone, away If you don't like being hurt then please don't stay It's hard to wave goodbye From airplanes when I Just don't think that you can see I taper off and say it's never worth the pain Sometimes it is And you don't care  Your face is on a billboard And you're everywhere You don't care much for interviews  You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you've gone, away  If you don't like being hurt then please don't stay If you don't like being hurt then please don't stay    God I wish that I could make this right     I wish that there was something worth the time   For her to give to me  A phone call from L.A. is my present  There's nothing left for me to give  I wish I could And I know that I should But you know I know, I won't And you don't care Your face is on a billboard And you're everywhere You don't care much for interviews You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you're gone You're gone, you're gone, you're gone, you've gone, away  If you don't like being hurt then please don't stay If you don't like being hurt then get away If you don't like being hurt then please don't stay      Globes And Maps by Something Corporate  Light breaks underneath A heavy door And I try to keep myself awake Fall all around us on a hotel floor  And you think that you've made a mistake And theres a pain in my stomach From another sleepless binge And I struggle to get myself up again      I want to hang onto something That wont break away or fall apart Like the pieces of my heart    And globes and maps are all around me now I want to feel you breathe me Globes and maps I see surround you here Why wont you believe me?  Globes and maps they chartered your way back home Do you want to leave or something? Dreams came around you In a hazy rain You open your mouth wide to feel them fall And I write a letter from a one-way train But I dont think you'll read it at all  And globes and maps are all around me now I want to feel you breathe me Why won't you believe me And globes and maps I see surround you here Why won't you believe me? Globes and maps they charter your way back home Do you want to leave or something?    I can't take this anymore I know that I can't take this anymore I can't take this anymore Cause I know someday I'll see you walk out that door    Globes and Maps are all around me now I want to feel you breathe me Globes and maps I see surround you here Why won't you believe me? Globes and maps they charter your way back home Do you want to leave? Do you want to leave? Globes and maps they charter your way back home Do you want to leave or something?

      I had a really weird dream last night, so I thought id post one last time... I was visiting Chris, but it was like a weird world(I watched the matrix before I went to bed maybe that had something to do with it) but, lots of the world wad underwater. like, there was two paths you could walk on, like one that had some water and one that was dry. well I found chris's house and it was like this underground house thing, it was really cool. well there were all these reporters there and they wanted to know who I was and we just like hid/ran from them. then he showed me inside and then around the town thing. we went on this thing like the scuddy dutty(its a thing me and chris did in4H camp where you walk down the river) but instead it was like, a river going into the ocean and yeah. well I was with katelyn and chris, and then somehow chris got separated from us but we knew we would meet him at the end. well then me and katelyn were just talking and sam and erek swam over to us. well i was getting pissed cuz like, erek was trying to feel me up or fuck me so i threatened him that chris would kick his ass( he would too) so then after that they just left and then we got to the end of the ocean thing and we found chris, and then i met jason, chris's friend(who i have never seen in real life) and then katelyn had to leave and then chris and i were deciding what kind of soda to get(random?) and then chris put one arm around jason and one around me and started saying something but i started to kiss his arm...lol then i woke up. then i fell asleep again, and i was with chris and something happened and i fell off his roof, or something and then the doctor said i had to stay put for 5 weeks. well i remember hallucinating and seeing grant in the room and i was like calling his name, and he came over to me and then chris like came over and leaned over me kissed my forehead and said grants not here... you were hallucinating. then he ran his hand around my face. but i could have swore that grant was in the room i thought. and i started to get a little mad cuz chris and i were going to have sex but then i got hurt so it like ruined it... but he said when i get better him and i would watch the nightmare before christmas and have sex on his couch.(whats with the random movie?) and then i remember like, falling asleep and then waking up, and then chris was by my side and he said that i was better so he picked me up, put me on the couch and well we had sex on his couch and nightmare before christmas was on the tv...lol then like 30 seconds into that i woke up cuz the sun was in my eyes. i started cursing and then rolled over.  lots of people think im weird

      well you know, the last week has been totaly great. wow. did i just say totaly great? wow. that was really girly. but anyway, yesterday/last night was really fun. Alison and Grant came over for a swim and to hang at my house till 10 pm. i almost got mom to let grant stay the night but i she changed her mind. damn her. im going to be in San Jose and San Francisco for about a week. Ill be back on the 8th of August. but im fucking pissed right now but im not going to get into it but yeah. well, maybe i will. ive got freaking guys asking me for butt sex and to talk dirty to them and well sex in general... and its really pissing me off. i mean, like like HELLO! NO! also erek mooned me on the web cam. nice. real nice. ahhh god. anyway. i baked a pie today! a blackberry one! lol i made it for a celtic holiday that i cant remember the strange name of, but yeah. also just to eat but you know. it had a purpose. i cant wait to leave for a week. but then again i dont, but then again, yeah. i want to leave. lol. well anyway. i miss people dearly right now. chris most of all. and of course there are my friends who fall behind him. but when you go without seeing someone for half a year you really start to remembre what you miss most. and its all coming back to me now. im confused at the moment about something,  but i think it will all work its self out in time.  yeah Grant, i lied. there is something wrong. but theres no way in hell im telling anyone. maybe when everything is said and done in the future, but not now. it would ruin some things, but possibly make some things better. but right now i dont feel like risking anything. i think ive found my safe zone and want to stay here for a short amout of time. well, oh yes, grant, about the nutmeg thing, mom is all iffy about it now, but i think that the next time im hanging in town with someone i could pick some up, grind it up at home, and then do the cooking at your house? cuz yeah... well whatever. umm... well i should go, its getting late. well i shall miss you all. i love you all with all my heart. and take care.

      im sitting in computer careers and the song i miss you from blink 182 came on. i love this song. im just singing along and everything. well i want to take a shower for some reason now... ive had the best showers this year. 3 of them. in different catagories. 1. Cold shower- Grants house. that was the best cold shower i have EVER taken. or, at least, to my knowledge. i remember laughing when i was in his shower too because i never thought id be taking a shower in grants shower...lol. but yeah. i also started laughing because there was a rubber ducky in there and for some reason i thought it was the funniest thing ever. i wonder if grant heard me laughing.  2. Hot shower- At the oak hill pool club. it was 9 at night or something and i had just gotten out of the cold, freezing, non heated pool. so i jumped into the sort of gross shower and turned the hot water on. that was the best hot shower ive had in awhile.  3. To Shower for some reason.- At allys house. it was right after we had dug a big mud hole and sat in it and threw mudd at each other, etc. boy, ive never felt so clean.lol! well thats it.    I Miss You  by Blink 182  (I miss you, miss you)   Hello there, the angel from my nightmare,  the shadow in the background of the morge,  the unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley  we can live like Jack and Sally if we want  where you can always find me  and we'll have Halloween on Christmas   and in the night we'll wish this never ends    we'll wish this never ends    (I miss you, miss you) (I miss you, miss you)   Where are you and I'm so sorry  I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight   I need somebody and always   this sick strange darkness  comes creeping on so haunting every time  and as I stared I counted  the webs from all the spiders  catching things and eating their insides  like indecision to call you  and hear your voice of treason   will you come home and stop this pain tonight    stop this pain tonight    Don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)    Don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)    Don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)  don't waste your time on me you're already  the voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)    (I miss you, miss you)  (I miss you, miss you)  (I miss you, miss you)  (I miss you, miss you)

      Name by Goo Goo Dolls And even though the moment passed me by  I still can't turn away  'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose  Got tossed along the way  And letters that you never meant to send  Get lost or thrown away  And now we're grown up orphans  That never knew their names  We don't belong to no one  That's a shame  But if you could hide beside me  Maybe for a while  And I won't tell no one your name  And I won't tell 'em your name  Scars are souvenirs you never lose The past is never far  Did you lose yourself somewhere out there Did you get to be a star  And don't it make you sad to know that life Is more than who we are  You grew up way too fast  And now there's nothing to believe And reruns all become our history  A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio And I won't tell no one your name  And I won't tell 'em your name  I won't tell 'em your name  Mmm, mmm, mmm  I won't tell 'em your name...   Mmmmmm  I think about you all the time  But I don't need the same  It's lonely where you are come back down And I won't tell 'em your name

Damn the government Damn their killing Damn their lies  Hush It's okay Dry your eyes Dry your eyes Soulmate dry your eyes Dry your eyes Soulmate dry your eyes Soulmates never die Soulmates never die Never die Soulmates never die Never die  Soulmates never die  Soulmates never die  Soulmates never die  Soulmates never die

      Its only been a few days since i have written, but i think i need to vent or something because suddently the pressure is on me again. boy, i need to get away. im camping next weekend so that will give me a chance to think. maybe. its all depending on the situation which i know hardly anything about. right now im cold and tired, and i am shivering like crazy. i want a hug. i want to lay down and sleep. i want to get away from this life for only a day. if only that was possible. i feel so tied down by by parents its not funny. my dad said its no ones fault but my own that im an independant person. but its hard for me to have some breathing room when they wont let me be independant. i donno. i feel like giving up a lot of things i usued to love doing. i want to have nothing that has any material value. except for a pen and paper. im scared. im scared at the fact that being alone feels right for me. it does. and it truely scares me. ive said that one of my greatest fears is being alone. maybe thats how its supposed to be. but then again, sometimes when im with certain people i feel like i can never be truely alone. this all means that i dont know shit. we all dont know shit. boy i feel sober as hell and need a drink. im thinking to much. usualy i speak like most guys in the fact that i say stuff straight up, when most girls put hidden meanings in things. i dont say things that have hidden meaning, but i think that things do. a happit that i have to break somehow. i over think things and i totaly freak out. lately ive had time to over think things, and its driven me out of my mind. that pool of sanity in my head is getting soaked up. pretty soon youll be able to visit me in a crazy house somewhere. or locked in my room.  IM SCARED.

      i got home last night from.. well if i said you all would figure me out now wouldnt you? and we cant have that now can we? well last night, when i got home, i drug myself into the house and into the kitchen. i didnt feel like sleeping just yet, and it was only 10 on a school night. mom offered me a little bit of her pasta and i excepted. i was still a little hungry for some reason. so i sat in the recliner and ate while bella and mom argured. so i kissed them goodnight and they asked where i was going and i whispered to bed to get away from you and walked to the computer room to cross off the day. it was the 7th. 7 has always been my favorite number... i went into my room, stripped down fully this time, and laid down in bed with the single cotten blanket i had. i stared at the celing for a bit. my big white empty celing. i thought about things as usual. though something bothered me. the bed i was sleeping in didnt feel right to me. like i should be somewhere else, like i didnt belong in that bed... something i havent felt in a long time. i turned from the celing like you would when your parents found out something bad youve done and look away in shame. i then just rolled over on to my stomach and hung my arm off the side of the bed and ran my finger across my laptop. i wanted to write my book right then and there, but i knew that i was way to tired. well i tosed and turned all night long, or it felt like it. when i woke up, i had a sore troat,and i couldnt open my eyes very wide,but i guess it didnt matter, everthing was a blur already. i got dressed and ready, i put my broken-sewn-back-together heart pendent on, then sat on my bed and typed away at my laptop. have you ever wished that you had more control over things, but once you have that you didnt like it? and you wish you had less control over things again? no? well i have. your quite lucky. this is gonna be my last post for awhile. i dont quite feel like writing for awhile.   today, july 8th, i found that daniel holly comited suicide. as i watched my cursor blink on this computer as i heard the news i thought... well... that dan would never do something like that. i didnt know him well, but i knew who he was enough to care. i usued to  like  the guy. he sat across from me in the 7th grade i think.we usued to talk a lot. though after that class was over we never really talked again. i would say that i wish i had, but then again i would be in more pain. they say they dont know the details of daniels death, but it so scary to see him hanging in his room by a rope. though im sure he didnt go that way, the thought is still scary. this paragraph is for you daniel holly. you will be remembered.  maybe i have powers. or maybe is the animal in me that senced the trouble of this morning. i new somthing was wrong. i could taste the metalicness in the air. as if i wasnt already doing not-to-well this morning something had to come up. though i expected it. my body is weak. i cant move very well at the moment. my body is also sore from god-knows-what too. im shivering and shaking, and quite frankly, i dont want to be here anymore. why is it that they always give you the news of someones death at the beginning of the day? now thats a day ruiner if i ever herd/had one.  this may not be my last post, maybe i will add a quote here and there. but i will  not  write anything of this sort for awhile. im just not up to it. but who knows, things change....  A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.-albert e.   I hold it true, whate'er befall;  I feel it, when I sorrow most;  'Tis better to have loved and lost  Than never to have loved at all.-alfred t.  The sage said, "The best thing is not to hate anyone, only to love. That is the only way out of it. As soon as you have forgiven those whom you hate, you have gotten rid of them. Then you have no reason to hate them; you just forget. -hazrat i. k.  You know quite well, deep within you, that there is only a single magic, a single power, a single salvation...and that is called loving. Well, then, love your suffering. Do not resist it, do not flee from it. It is your aversion that hurts, nothing else.-hermann h.  A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.-ingrid b.  Absence is to love as wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small and kindles the great-roger r.  This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time. -Chuck Palahniuk   You buy furniture.  You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life.  Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled.  Then the right set of dishes.  Then the perfect bed.  The drapes.  The rug.  Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.-Chuck Palahniuk  "It's only after you've lost everything," Tyler says, "that you're free to do anything."-Chuck Palahniuk   "People don’t want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. Their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messes cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown"-Chuck Palahniuk   "No matter how much you think you love somebody, you’ll step back when the pool of their blood edges up too close"-Chuck Palahniuk   "Look. The people you are after are the people you depend on. We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls, we drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not fuck with us." -Chuck Palahniuk   "The magic of sex is that it's acquisition without the burden of possessions. No matter how many women you take home, there's never a storage problem."-Chuck Palahniuk   “All god does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be  boring.”-Chuck Palahniuk   “Big Brother isn’t watching. He’s singing and dancing. He’s pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother’s busy holding your attention every moment you’re awake. He’s making sure you’re always distracted. He’s making sure you’re fully absorbed.”-Chuck Palahniuk   “The trick to forgetting the big picture is to look at everything close-up.”-Chuck Palahniuk

      ahhh crap! im sooo tired. i didnt get much sleep last night. but whatever. but right now im kinda pissed at the chair im sitting in. my back ribs hurt because of the chair. ahh oh well. the fourth of july was pretty fun. i could have been better. chuck pissed me off soo much though. by the end of the night i was almost in tears cuz he kept disconnecting me from the internet/ the power on my laptop so i couldnt talk to chris. so by the time i got back on (for about the 4th time)chris was gone but he sent me an email saying he had to get to bed and that hes sorry about chuck etc. so yeah. well before that i was handcuffed to the bed for about an hour or so. or it felt like it. chuck has those police handcuffs that you have to have a key for so yeah i was handcuffed to the foot of my bed. then chuck kept trying to mark me with a marker. oo boy it annoyed me. its like go annoy your girlfriend! shes laying on the bed right next to me! but yeah. there was a cool guy at our house named Richard. he was about 17. he would sneak beers and hide the bottles behind my round chair. meanwhile i was on my second glass of margarita. one of our big crystal classes too. so i had about 4 maybe 5 cups of margarita. considering the glasses hold a little more than 2 cups a piece. my good old uncle would bring over the pitcher for me and pour me another glass after awhile. it felt nice to not be able to walk right. alisas dad brought really good fireworks, but we got about 3/4s through them and the firs department came. so that sucked. and the fireworks this year for the town sucked more than they did last year so.. yeah. but otherwise. the 4th was ok. it could have been better. oh yeah, grant, if your out there, and i forget to tell you. my uncle saw you propose to me! lol haha... but ill tell you more about that later if you remind me. well i love you all! bye bye!

      yes, thisis my 100th post. not that it matters or anything... but i need to take down my dream from last night and tell you about my trip down here. well first off here is my trip down... on my way out i kissed everyone goodbye, but on my backpack and grabbed out my suitcasae and walked out the door. i was finally leaving. i put my suitcase in the back seat next to me and my backpack as well. when we pulled out of the driveway the song way away was playing. " way away away from here I'll be." etc. then we soon got to santa rosa and we put the top down on the convertable and put my hair back and under a viser. uncle put in the goo goo dolls for me and we turned it really loud! i was free!!!!! soon we got to the san francisco bridge and it was really cold. but i put my hands in the air and screamed YES! IM FREE! and then contained myself.  my dream.... well i was in school i think and i was with someone and i saw kenny t.(who i havent seen in months) and i ran up to him and jumped on him and he caught me. (so like my legs were wrapped around him.) so i was like omg! kenny how are you? and he was like great! and he kissed me on the mouth fast and was like i cant believe we never talked! i said me to! and he kissed me a few times on the mouth really fast and then said well umm, what are you up to? i said just hanging out here. he said me too. and then erek came up and jumped on kennys shoudlers and mooned everyone! then after a minute of getting erek off kennys back i jumped off kenny. then i said bye and walked away and then everyone was giving me dirty looks!! then i saw grant and i was like hi grant! and he said " your a whore" and walked away pissed! i chased after him and i was like what did i do wrong??? i didnt do anything wrong! grant? come back! PLEASE! i pleaded with him for another minute then he set his green cd played on the ledge and then jumped off and totally forgot it. then i grabbed it, then put it down cuz i thought he would come back and get it. well i looked up and grant was gone so i ran forward and was yelling grant! Please! Grant come back! everyone was looking at me but i didnt care. class was about to start so i slowly walked to class and sat down in tears. well i sat up really fast (in bed) cuz racheals bunny was chewing on the bars of her cage and it scared me. not to mention the dream made me sad and panicky too. damn that was an aweful dream. well take care all.
