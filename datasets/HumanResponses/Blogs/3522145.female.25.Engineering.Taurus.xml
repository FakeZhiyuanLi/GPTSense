       I got a parking ticket yesterday.. my first.  I got it parking in downtown Palo Alto.  I was there for a 7 hr training but all the parking in the area was only for 2 hrs.  Since the lot I was in was not color zoned, that meant I just had to move my car to a different space every two hours.  In Palo Alto, if you park your car in a color zone, you have to move it to a completely different color zone after two hours and cannot return to the first zone for the rest of the day.  Well I was happy I was in a no color zone..so when I went to move my car -- I saw the space right behind me was empty.  Wow, that was easy I thought, so I backed my car into that space and walked back to my training.  Well 2 hrs later, I return to move my car again and find myself with a parking ticket.  Apparently, backing my car up into the next space is not enough to remove the chalk they marked on my tires and therefore I was faulted for staying in the same space too long even though I didn't.  The ticket is for a little over $27.  That is not a whole lot, but you know it just seems unfair.  Yes, I know you can argue about how I didn't think that there would be no way for the cop to know I actually  moved my car when I didn't remove the chalk marking.  But this was also my first time dealing with time limit parking in a situation like this so I didn't even think about how they were going to determine if my car moved or not.  Now, I know better.. but I still refuse to think I deserve a ticket.  I'm going to try argue it.. hopefully I will win but I'm guessing not :-(

       Faith loves to go outside of our house to play. She's gotten used to understanding that she needs shoes first before going outside, so when we show any indication that we may be heading out the front door, she runs for the door and then picks up her shoes ready for action.  It is adorable to watch.  Faith gets excited whenever Katie, our dog, gets a walk.    Since our neighborhood is pretty safe (we are at the end of a dead end street), I let her roam free around our association grounds sometimes and stands back to see what she wants to do.  It almost reminds me of walking our dog because she is so curious about everything around her.. there is no such thing as a quick walk.. there is only walk a few steps and smell the flowers.. then when she's had enough of touching the flowers, walk another few steps and notice something that stands out on the ground like a little piece of blue paper.  She just loves exploring the world around her -- and of course getting lots of space to walk, walk, and walk some more.  The wonderful world of being upright and moving!  I probably would have never noticed the single step of purple flowers amongst white flowers which grow 2 inches from the ground outside our door if it were not for Faith.  On another note.. I'm so tired.. I went to bed at 2am and she woke up at 6am.. but only one of us didn't ger her goodnight's sleep.   But you know.. it is that time of year when a Buffy season is released...and how can you help but to watch just a "little" bit more? ;-)  Which explains my incoherent thoughts on this post.

       I hated applying to college when I was in high school.  All the essays were annoying.  Not that I hate writing, but all the writing they expected me to do always seemed like they want me to brag about myself somehow.  I'm just not that into doing that.  I still don't know how to write about all my accomplishments without seeming all arrogant.  Anyway, that's what I thought back then.. thinking back, they probably just wanted me to write something so they can understand how I think (that is, if they read the essays at all -- I hear that essays are usually disregarded unless you're on the borderline).  Anyway, I thought it was just extremely time consuming if not anything else.    So why am I doing it again?  I want to go to graduate school.. darn that need to learn more! :-)  It should be much easier this time around though, I'm applying to only 1 school and not 6.  I also am not really going to try to deal with getting scholarships since I highly doubt I qualify for much if any.  So the process should be quite quick and painless.  I finished studying for and taking the GRE.  I even started my online application for the school (San Jose State Univ)... just one thing left.  The Statement of Purpose.  I like that it is a statement of purpose and not a "tell us about yourself" type of essay.  But still similar in nature I suppose.  I mean I have to reveal parts of myself to explain my "purpose".  So wish me luck in finishing that last step.... I don't think I should put on the essay that I'm a procrastinator.

       Our little girl turned 1 year old today!  I can't believe the whole giving birth thing happened a year ago.. the time just flew right by.  I remember when we first joined a moms club when she was 4 months old.  A woman told me to treasure every moment cause the first year will just fly right by.  Well at that time, I just wondered why I was feeling the first 4 months went by so slowly.   I was so absolutely tired and did not know how much development and wonderful interaction was ahead for us.  Now she's sleeping through the night and such a joy during the day.. it's a miracle how much the disappearance of sleep deprevation can improve one's outlook on life!    Anyway.. it is 11:58 pm and I'm exhausted which means I don't want to say much more other than that I want to close my eyes and lie down for a good night's rest.  Faith had a great day today by being a good little girl -- I guess that actually means *I* had a great day today.  She napped and ate well and played a lot.  What more can I ask for?  We gave her all the food she loves of course .. no forcing junky peas to her as lunch.  Yup.. it is a sweet potatoes kind of day.   We are throwing her her b-day party on Sunday....I hope she enjoys having her friends and their mommies and daddies over!

       Buffy fans should recognize that title easily.. the much anticipated (by the Buffy addicts) Buffy Season 6 came out about a week ago and we finally got the time to open it up and stare at our TV.  We finished the first two part episode.. and couldn't help ourselves but to skip ahead and watch that musical episode.  Our practical belief of going in order just was overridden by our love of those musical numbers and plot advancements.  The first time I got seriously into Buffy was season 6 -- and probably mostly in part due to this episode.  See, I was enticed to see it after seeing how much my hubby was anticipating it.  Now, I think I'm the bigger addict.  Why was the muscial episode so wonderful?  Josh Whedon is so talented that he wrote the music and lyrics to the entire episode.. and not only did he make it entertaining.. it advances the story for just about all the characters in the show.   We watched it with subtitles on.. that make the lyrics that much more meaningful.  Why did I decide to write about that today?  Well.. there is this part in the show that talks about how, by making everyone sing in the episode, a lot of personal feelings and thoughts come out in word for others to hear.  Thoughts that were meant to be secret, became forced out of the characters.  That was a neat thought... I mean there is truth to that.  Why do we love so much of the music we hear?  or dedicate songs to people?   Sometimes I guess, it seems less odd or awkward if you're expressing some emotions or words through song or poetry instead of regular conversation.  Imagine.. what would happen to our world and many of our relationships if someone placed a spell on all of us to sing our feelings for a few days..

       Faith is at that point now that she can do more than is safe for her to understand.   She knows how to move step stools (or anything really that can be used as a step stool) to places so that she can climb to where she wants to go.  Which means, the baby proofing can get pretty useless if she can figure out how to get over them!  We put things on tables too high for her to reach, but now with the help of a step stool, and another chair that is even higher -- things on the table are no longer out reach.  As mentioned in an earlier entry, she knows how to go down the stairs now.   But that is dangerous too, because sometimes she can try to be too fast or she gets distracted -- and there we go.. a possible accident waiting to happen.  She loves being outdoors and exploring different things.  She still explores by sticking stuff in her mouth...how do you teach her that it is dangerous to stick some unknown object in your mouth?  You know.. back in the first few months after Faith was born -- I experienced post-partum baby blues.  Now that I have read more about that (after the fact of course), I realized there were lots of signs I should have expected it to happen.  Anyway, one of the reasons I felt all depressed was that I had always wanted to have a baby.  For many years, I felt destined to be a mother.. and determined to be a good mother when given the chance.  I loved watching other people with their children and playing with friend's children and so forth.  My mind was filled with the romanticized ideas of taking leisurely strolls hand in hand with my baby and teaching her things -- you know right from wrong, how things work, etc.  -- Bear with me here, I know it may seem like I am off course from my first paragraph, but I'll get back to it --  So romaticized notions ... then Faith was born.  She was a very physically strong baby at birth kicking me harder than I could imagine a newborn could -- but still she was a "lump".  She couldn't do a whole lot.  I didn't feel she could even recognize the difference between me and a perfect stranger.  All my hardwork to take care of her during all her waking *and* sleeping moments, seem unappreciated.  I didn't feel a need to talk with her -- why when she didn't understand me anyway?  I remember thinking at that time that this is what I sort of knew it would be like in the back of my head -- but refused to fully accept because I was so filled with those romanticized notions for so long.  Like I said, I was depressed.  I wanted to teach her so much, and I wanted do so much with her but realized it would be a long while before any of that could happen.  I thought, "oh... it will be so much easier once she can interact with me..."  Why easier?  Well, so that my talking to her would not be pointless, because she'd understand me.  So I kept waiting for her become interactive.     Well needless to say really, I got over the baby blues .. and she became VERY interactive.  So interactive now that I realized how naive I was to think it would be "easier!"   Things are certainly more like I fantasized about before having a baby...and everything has felt so rewarding.  I know she understands a lot that is going around her.. how else would she catch on to doing so many things without true (step by step) instruction?  She is very observant.  But does she understand all the things I say to her?  I doubt it (please, correct me if you know I'm wrong!).  So when she goes and gets herself in a dangerours position...how do I tell her "don't do it because it is dangerous" and have her understand the concept of danger?  I really don't want to just say "no" all the time, I want to say "no" with a reason to support it.  But at this point of her development, should I just expect "no" to suffice?  I've read that at this age, it would be good to just prevent her from getting into danger instead of saying "no" a lot -- but how much prevention can you do when she is determined to get her way with her newly learned techniques?!

       If you haven't noticed already...almost all I talk about is my little girl.  What can I say, my life revolves around her.  Well of course my life also involves my wonderful and loving hubby, doggy and our lives in our little home.. and you'll be sure to hear about all of that too if you read my ramblings consistently.. but every since Faith was born our lives (my hubby, me, and doggy) all had to adjust for her and no one is changing as quickly as her. Forgive me for mentioning a lot of things from the past too (from the first year of her life) because this is my tool to jot down stuff I want to be able to look back on many years later.  I am absolutely horrible with keeping a journal... never have been successful with that. I thought having a baby and my desire to remember stuff on her development would change that but I was wrong.. there were other issues I had to deal with earlier in her life than remember to make journal entries!  Anyway, this blog is my solution.  For some reason, I feel a need to post on the blog.  Most likely it is because I feel the obligation since I know at least one or two people are reading it.  It's like everything I did as a child right?  I did lots of stuff as a child cause I felt my parents would check on me and feel disappointed if I didn't do it.  It is this weird thing in me...the need to please others.  Which would bring me to tell you that I would be great at customer service!  But now I'm off course...  So then, this blog.  Since I only started it when Faith turned 1, I want to also include stuff from the first year.  Stuff I still remember ... things I may forget later.  So now you'll understand why I seem to reminisce over the past so much.. but then I've always been that way too :-)

       We were at a friend's house for a playdate today.. they live on the 3rd floor of an apartment complex.  For the first time, I let Faith walk from the elevator to the apartment because I thought she would enjoy the trip (as opposed to me carrying her the whole way).  I knew this meant the walk would take much longer but the weather was beautiful and it was such a pleasant and fairly short stroll.  She had a blast looking at everything around her.  She loved leaning over the railing to look below her.  Her favorite view must have been the huge water fountain in the middle of the stroll.  She wouldn't budge even after several minutes of staring over the railing at the water fountain.  At that time, I thought of two things.. "I wish she would move so we can get started on our playdate!" and "I wonder what she's thinking about the water fountain."  I know I tend to get stuck staring at things for a long time too...there is just something about water that attracts me to stare...it is mesmerizing.  But for all I know, she could have been staring at something other than the water fountain.  In any case, I ended up having to pick her up and move her quite a few steps away in order to get her heading toward our destination.  After the playdate, which she had a great time tiring out herself, we went through the same route backwards.  She stopped again at the waterfall, but this time she was exhausted and was easier to pull away from the waterfall.   In other Faith news, she's figured out how to climb down the stairs.  She was able to climb up the stairs around 8 months of age, and we've never really encouraged climbing down the stairs.  She has also been very careful in general with climbing because she'd always wait for us to follow her and she never really attempted to go down the stairs.  But today, she felt like being adventurous, and she also knew we were right next to her-- which encouraged her.  She has 3 ways of going down -- she used all 3 methods in one trip down the steps.  The 3 methods are backwards, walking down by holding the railing, and also sliding down in a sitting position (one step at a time).  She was ecstatic when she realized she finished at was at the bottom of the stairway.  She didn't get a chance for the rest of the day to do it again, so we have yet to see if it will be a constant problem of watching her go down.  I'll be surprised if it doesn't.

          I finally put up Faith's 1 year photos to complete "Faith's First Year" webpage.  The page is located in  urlLink our homepage .    So much has happened in this first year!  Faith has developed from a strong little lump kicking me from inside my tummy to a fully mobile, active, and happy child.  She's done more in her first year than many older than her too.  She has gone on road trips to Reno (1.5 mo), Seattle (3 mo), Los Angeles (6 mo), and Las Vegas (7 mo).  She has also flown to Hawaii and Japan (10 mo-1 yr) and taken a cruise to Alaska (3 mo).  This is a baby that loves to travel.  Not that she had the choice, but she loves when we take her to see new places.  But the front yard is plenty fun too... last night she dragged me to the front door and sat down on the floor with her feet out at me.  As if she wasn't making herself clear enough, she picked up her shoes to hand to me too.  But the poor girl had to be explained that it was too dark to play outside and that she had to wait until morning.  Well, she did the same thing again this morning and out we went for a little stroll in our neighborhood at 7 in the morning!

       It is just so much fun how Faith loves silly games.  Aside from the common peek-a-boo games, she loves when we imitate her like when she flings her head back to look up at the ceiling.  If we do the same thing, she just giggles like it's the funniest thing in the world.  She also thinks it is funny to shake her head and to make you shake your head with her too.  Last night, she had a fun time just lifting up my shirt to look at my tummy, then she lightly tries to pinch my flab.  Now, if anyone else did that, would I find it amusing?  Of course not, but my own daughter doing it to explore and learn about things and people around her... I was just drowned in adoration for her.    Her mommy time is much less "active" than daddy time.  Daddy twirls her in circles on his head and chases her around the house.  She also loves to watch daddy play with her doggie Katie.  There are so many things that make Faith laugh uncontrollably now... that laughter is only one of the many things I love about being a mom.  One of the most exciting moments of her growth was the first time we heard her laugh.  Her first laugh was on August 31 of last year.  She was about to turn 3 months old, and we had just finished a 7 day cruise to Alaska.  We were heading up the elevator into our hotel room before we start the drive home the next day.  She just started bursting out in laughter on the elevator -- for whatever reason, her daddy and I couldn't figure out, but it was the most joyous sound to my ears.   And for the rest of the day, we kept trying to get her to laugh again.  I can't imagine ever tiring of hearing her laugh .. and would never want to :-)

       I finally figured out how to change the comment system so that anyone can post comments without having to register with Blogger first, or having to be "anonymous" :-)  Yay!  Now, I just have to get around to adding links to other sites.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can further improve this blog?  Thanks for reading!

       There is nothing like having guests over to make you clean your home.. if you're me anyway :-) And there is nothing like having lots of babies over to mega-babyproof your home.  So my hubby and I worked hard on that before people started streaming into our home.  Well we found out all that babyproofing was not all that necessary since there was at least one parent, almost two, for every baby at the party.  With so many eyes to catch things.. no kid can get away with anything!  We all had lots of fun at her party -- we had 6 other babies, some a little bit older than Faith and some a little younger.  Everyone enjoyed some cake, homemade ice cream, wafers, shu mai, chocolate candy, animal crackers, and a variety of Gerber finger foods.  The theme for the party was Winnie-the-pooh.  I picked the theme but Faith seems to really like pooh.. that must be her favorite stuff animal to carry around!  Faith has learned that she loves balloons.  After daddy blew up one balloon, she begged to play with it-- but that wasn't enough!  She wanted the second one too so that she can have one in each hand.  Poor girl had to find out that balloons are too hard to carry one in each hand if there is no string attached!  It was so much fun to see her with all her friends -- some she hadn't seen for a long time! And unlike a typical playdate, we got to see the daddies with the babies too!  All her friends left with a little goodie bag that included a t-shirt from Hawaii :-)  Our home was noticeably much quieter after everyone left.

       Highlight of my day.  I asked for a kiss from Faith while she was walking to another end of the living room.  When she heard me ask for the kiss, she turned around, dropped her pacifier and came right up and kissed me!  And kissed me a second time after that.. then she went and kissed her daddy too :-)  No, this is not a common occurence, though I wish it was.  She does not give kisses 100% of the time when requested, but it is such a joy whenever she does give a kiss :-) Most of the time, when she doesn't give a kiss, it is usually because she is too preoccupied looking for what else to get her hands into.  This girl seems to have too many things on her daily agenda to give kisses whenever its requested!

       Tuesday night was a night of little sleep, as I complained about... then Wednesday night, last night, I guess she felt she really needed to catch up?  She went to bed at 9pm.  I was still trying to catch up on sleep, so I went to bed around 10:30pm.  Notice how it is even earlier than the previous night to try to ensure myself a little more sleep :-)  She wanted to be up and playing at midnight but her daddy took care of her so I got to stay in bed.  Her daddy put her back in bed soon after 1 am.  Then she slept until 8:50 am this morning!  So I got to sleep from 10:30pm last night until essentially 8:50 this morning.. with only some small wakeups during the night!  What a change huh?  I feel much more rested today than I have felt for a long time!  And despite her midnight wake up, that was still a much longer nights sleep than usual for her.  So she had a good nights sleep too :-)  Even her daddy got to sleep a little more than normal.  We were a happily awake family this morning :-)

       Regarding motherhood --  "you've got to be a saint to not long for some time alone from the baby".   I heard or read that somewhere, but I can't remember who said it.   But I can tell you I'm not a saint.  I purposly went to bed earlier than usual last night at 11:30pm because I have been feeling so exhausted.  So I thought, I'd get a longer nights rest if I went to bed earlier.  Faith had other plans.  She wanted to be up and playing from 2:20 am to 5:10 am this morning.  I really have no complaints about her sleeping through the night for the last few months, she's been doing very well.  But once in a long while, caused by something I can't figure out, she decides to be up for several hours in the middle of the night.  She woke up for the day a little later than usual, but still not to my liking -- luckily her daddy was able to take over and watch her so that I could sleep in.  She's been especially tired during the day of course, which I'm thankful for so that I can catch up on more sleep.  While I napped parts of today, her daddy took care of her and took her out of the house for a walk.  Yes, that alone time is much appreciated... and what do I do with it?  Nap of course :-)  It's just that I've been soooo tired, which made last night more difficult than it normally would have been.  But we think we may know why I've been so tired...  In other news, Faith got her first professional haircut today.  They trimmed her bangs and evened out her hair.  She was miserable, cried the whole way through.  Can't say we, as in her parents, are all that satisfied with how things turned out.  We're going to attempt her next cut ourselves.  What I am glad about is that they have shaped her hair to determine which would be the bangs, so that gives me something to work from next time.  We hope her next haircut won't be as traumatic.  The good news is that they gave us a little envelope filled with the hair they cut out marked  "baby's first haircut" .. so we have that to put in her memory box.

       Woohoo!  I finally completed my Statement of Purpose for San Jose State.  So now my application is submitted and so are my transcripts from UT.  I don't think the department I'm applying to requires recommendation letters, I didn't see it listed as a requirement anyhow.. so if that is the case, all I have left is to wait for their response!

            Yesterday was the first day Faith was allowed to hold the leash while we walk Katie.  This picture was taken today.    She loves to hold the leash, and begs for it as soon as she sees her daddy take it out.  She also knows the leash is a sign that Katie gets to go outside, which means, she gets to go outside.  Faith did a great job holding the leash and keeping up with Katie.  She held the leash for the *entire* walk both yesterday and today -- which is over 20 mintues.  Katie also does a great job with letting Faith hold her leash.  Faith loves to go outside, Faith loves to spend time with her doggy, and her doggy loves to go outside. Faith also loves to be independent and do the things her daddy and mommy does...so what else could be more perfect than having Faith take her doggy outside?  It seems we have found the perfect dog walker for Katie!

       We went to the Cupertino Art, Wine, and Cultural festival today.  Art and Wine festivals are usually fun just to walk around and since it was at the Memorial Park which is so close to us, we wanted to go again this year.  Our local newspaper said that this year there would be more kiddie activities including a train the whole family could ride on.  We were excited because we figured Faith would love this.  Well, as it turned out, all the kiddie activities were for older kids, but the biggest bummer was that there was no train ride.  We're not sure why, but we were there for the first two hours of the event and the train was nowhere to be seen.    We still had fun at the festival though.  There was an International food court with lots of different foods to pick from, free live music all day, and free giveaways by some local vendors.  Faith got a free balloon from a credit union!  She loved walking around all day with the helium balloon tied to her wrist.  The last time she was given a helium balloon was when she was 5 months old (when she couldn't care less about it).  But this time, she had a great time playing with it.  We plan on dropping by again tomorrow just to pick up lunch so we can try out a different meal.. we had a hard time deciding between some dishes today so we figured we'll just eat there twice :-)  Even Faith enjoyed some of her daddy's BBQ chicken with fried rice :-)

         For the past 4 days now, ever since our  urlLink dinner at Chilli's  on Monday, Faith has been feeding herself her entire dinner.  She's doing a great job not needing baby food during her dinner and eating what we eat for dinner.  I put a Faithie size portion of our dinner on a little plate with a suction cup so that she can't toss the plate over the table.  And we sit her down on her feeding table and let her feed herself.  For about 25% of the meal, she'll actually try to feed herself with her fork, but then she gets tired of that and decides it is just so much easier and faster with her hands.  She's able to feed herself enough so that we don't need to supplement with a jar afterwards.  She also gets to finish off with some snacks afterward :-)    It really makes for some easier meal times in that my hubby and I can eat at the same time she eats.  Also she's happy to be independent.  Several times I thought I'd help her use her fork but she just took it back from me because she wanted to be independent.  It makes for a big clean up job after each meal, but so much fun to watch her learn and see what she picks to eat.  Faith also enjoyed some Jamba juice today.. since there is an Art, Wine, and Cultural festival tomorrow at the park, we're planning to share more of our Jamba juice with her :-)  On some not so positive news, she was quite difficult to put down to bed tonight.  It took over an hour with efforts from both her daddy and me.  It seems the hot weather is making her quite uncomfortable.

       This morning I asked Faith to look for her Pooh stuffed animal and bring it to me.  She did it immediately:  she turned to find Pooh behind her and retrieved it, then carried it over to me :-) I am so proud of her.  I suspected she knows what I'm talking about but I never really asked her to do something for me other than kisses, so this was a first moment.  She loves to pick things up and give them to people, so all the other requests to bring stuff might have been accidental.  I didn't really know if she really understood the previous requests or just did it because she enjoys giving away what's in her hand. Today, she didn't already see or play with Pooh yet, which is why I'm proud that she was able to find it, retrieve it, and carry it to me when I simply asked her without any hand motions.   Now I'm more encouraged than ever to teach her names to more things around her :-)  In other news, we had a park playdate today with Las Madres and Faith and I had plenty of fun.  I was hoping it would tire her out for a long nap, but she's only napped at most 40 minutes since then!  Also, I contested my  urlLink parking violation .  I'm told I'll get my results within 4 weeks.  Wish me luck!

         No.. it hasn't been a jam packed weekend .. I don't have a great excuse for not writing for a couple of days.  What's my excuse then?  Only that I've been tired and slept early and napped a lot ... meaning that all the quite time when Faith is napping, I've been using to get some zzzs myself.. so no writing.  Yesterday, on Father's day she napped for 3 hours in the afternoon after having a 1.5 hr morning nap!  The 3 hrs is a record.. the only time she's napped longer than that was back in the first week of her life when she had jaundice (in which case we didn't like the long naps!)  Anyhow, so that was a nice thing she did for her parents... the 3 hr nap :-)    What else did we do during the weekend... well we went to a Father's day picnic on Saturday with our Las Madres playgroup.  And true, it is more for the mommies since the daddies didn't all know each other.  It was just really a big family playdate/picnic.  Faith had lots of fun playing on big slides and spring seesaws and hanging out on the swing when she got tired.   We did a ton of grocery shopping at Marina because it was double coupon day (Buy $80 of stuff and get $16 back as discount at their deli) in honor of Father's day, and because we hadn't shopped there for months.       We tried to eat out on Father's day but the restaurant we wanted to try had not opened yet.. though the scheduled grand opening was June 10!  So we had Father's day eating out today instead at Chilli's.  By doctor's suggestion, we've been trying to get Faith more on table food and less on baby food and today was our most successful day at Chilli's.  She loved their spanish rice and saltine crackers.  She also had some taste of spinach from my quesadilla and mash potatoes from daddy's meal.  In addition, she had two large pork chop samples from our Costco shopping trip after the dinner.  It's her first dinner that was all table food, and no baby food.  She was a happy girl with all the yummy food.  I'm ecstatic she enjoyed all that pork chop because the past week or so she's been going through a phase of not liking table food she has to chew (other than rice).  I guess the pork chops were too tasty to pass up!  We just bought lots of pork chop from Costco too since it was on sale this week, so hopefully she'll be enjoying more pork chop later this week!

       I proctored an exam for Princeton Review today which is a nice way for me to bring in a little money without being out of the house too much.  So Faith had a lot of time with her daddy today.  She's getting increasingly difficult to feed because she's trying to be more independent, so it was difficult for her daddy to feed her lunch.  Lately, practically all her meals where we feed her instead of her feeding herself have been joint efforts from both of us.  She wants to feed herself, but we haven't given her the freedom for all her meals yet (only dinner) because she is pretty picky about what she feeds herself.  She doesn't want to feed herself vegetable or fruit pieces and sometimes meat pieces.  Mostly she just wants to feed herself rice.  We don't want her diet to be composed of only rice, so we try our best to get other variety into her tummy during her breakfast, lunch, and meal before bedtime.  Her daddy got spinach into her tummy for lunch today along with some yogurt, so that was good for Faith.    So as I said, I was out of the house to proctor an exam. I actually proctored the new SAT format that students will have to take to get to college soon.  It is quite different from the old SAT in that it has an essay section and there are no analogies anymore.  Verbal is slightly modified and tests some new skills.  But the poor kids, it is now *10* sections in each test, instead of the previous 7!  It is significantly longer for them to sit through, over 4 hours of testing.  I wonder how it will be when Faith has to take the SAT someday... that will be many years down the road.  What I like about going away for a few hours to work is that when I get back home, I always feel refreshed to take on the mommy role again.  I know proctoring is pretty relaxing and definitely not your most tiring job in the world, but I have been away for more tiring work and it is still always a nice feeling to come home.  I think that is one of the nicest things about marriage and family... being able to come home to them and know they're there for you and you get to spend time together to relax and play.  We also went to an Indian dinner tonight at one of our favorite restaurants, Bombay Oven.  Faith enjoyed the rice there and few pieces of lamb, but it was harder for her to feed herself the rice because it was so loose instead of sticking to her fingers like our regular white rice.  Nonetheless, she still had a full meal and we enjoyed a nice meal out together.   Have a Happy Fourth of July!

       I know, it's hard to believe... she's only just turned 1 and I already signed her up for preschool.  I heard about this from my Las Madres playgroup and it sounded interesting.  This one is unique (in my opinion anyway, which is not much since I don't know much about preschools) because you can be as young as 13 months to sign up.  It is Bright Beginnings Preschool.  It goes all the way up to 4 years old, until they go on to kindergarten.  Faith is signed up with the level 3 class which means she'll be in the youngest group of kids (13 mo -16 mo).  It is for 2 hrs a day, 1 day a week, for 8 weeks.   And a parent attends the class with the child each week so I get to be with Faith, not only to watch over her, but also to learn how I can be most helpful in continuing the education at home and so forth.  As the child gets older, the classes get longer and more frequent and the parent attends less and less classes so that the child learns to be more independent to be ready for kindergarten.  School starts in the fall for Faith on Aug 30th.  They have a  urlLink handbook online  that gives all the details on what goes on during classes.  But in summary, the curriculum covers:  -Free Play / Exploration Time -Circle Time (Music, Movement, Stories, Games, etc.) -Art Exploration -Motor Development -Adult Observation and Discussion Period -Field Trip  Here's a little excerpt from their handout:  Bright Beginnings is a parent participation preschool and parent education program. A developmental approach to learning is emphasized. A variety of age appropriate activities are presented for exploration and observation. This approach allows for development of the whole child: emotional, physical, intellectual, and social.  Parent Program: Parents interact with and observe children in the preschool setting. They function as Teacher Aides in the classroom and on the playground. They assist the teacher, facilitate the learning process, and supervise for safety. A parent education discussion is included. Adult students meet with their teacher to learn developmentally appropriate practices and discuss different aspects of raising a young child including: cognitive development, social development, speech and language development, discipline techniques, and available community resources.   The whole quarter (8 weeks) costs $90, and if we like the program, we are guaranteed a seat for all future quarters.  We figured for $90, it was worth a try to see how Faith likes it and how beneficial the program is.  Hopefully she likes it, I know I'm excited to check it out!

          Well, remember when I said I've been  urlLink feeling really tired  lately... here's the reason why!  We have another little one on the way.  According to this ultrasound taken today, our second one is 7 weeks and 0 days on the way :-)  The expected due date is Feb. 17, 2005.  We are very excited!  The most exciting part was seeing the baby's heartbeat on the ultrasound machine!  If you look very closely at the ultrasound, you'll see two "+" marking the ends of the baby.  According to the technician, our "little" baby is only about 1 cm long!  Daddy and Faith were both at the office visit with me today to see and experience everything.  I have switched to a new OB/GYN since my last pregnancy and I like this office much better.  The office is called  urlLink "Women's Care for Life" .  I have yet to meet my OB, but the nurse midwife was wonderful along with the ultrasound technician there.  With my last OB office, we often felt rushed to get out and the nurse midwife was rude, but with this office everyone was very friendly and more than happy to answer all questions.  The nurse midwife even went into detail about how I should be taking care of myself now instead of just handing off books for us to read.  I'm happy she didn't just assume I should know everything because I had one baby already.  Faith was good at the office, but very active.  This meant daddy had to chase after her quite a bit!  That must have been very tiring since we were there for nearly 2 hrs for both the ultrasound and checkup.

         Our wonderful and loving doggie,  urlLink Katie , has been diagnosed with tartar buildup on her teeth.  I've heard time and time again from vets that poor dental health is one of the biggest problems faced by dogs.  Poor teeth leads to poor health and our vet provides more  urlLink  detail  on this.  We love our doggie.  She's barely 6 years old, and couldn't be a better family dog for us.  She is loving, patient with Faith, and well mannered, and we certainly don't want her life limited by dental issues.  So we decided to follow our vet's advice and give her a much needed tartar cleaning.   The surprising thing is how much tartar cleaning costs for a dog.  I know we don't have dog insurance, but gosh the whole procedure costs over $300!  I know for a fact that my own dental cleanings cost $80 each without insurance.  But for a dog, apparently there is more than the cleaning procedure you have to pay for.  First, you need to pay for a blood test ($105) to make sure that anasthesia can be used, then there is anasthesia to administer, and then finally the cleaning.  So then that makes sense why it would cost so much, but still ... I would have never guessed a simple dental cleaning would cost so much for a dog!  The good thing is that if we make sure to maintain her teeth after the procedure, then we hopefully won't have to do this again.  I can't imagine how much a bigger procedure would cost!  I know Katie had cancer removed from her right before we adopted her.  The rescue foundation,  urlLink NARF , must have saved us a huge bundle!

       Is it possible to figure out what's going on in her mind?  Remember when I talked about how she learned to give  urlLink kisses ?  Well, once we figured out she knows to give kisses on command, of course we ask her every day for kisses.  But Faith gets to decide which days she wants to kiss.  In fact for several days, she wouldn't give any kisses no matter who asked, but today was a kissy day for her.  So that was nice.  I guess she decides day to day what kind of day it will be for her.  It'd be nice to know if something triggered her decision to kiss today that didn't happen on the other days!  She saw me cutting up a hot dog today and she was begging to get some pieces to eat.  So I fed her a couple pieces by hand.  The rest I put into her plate for her dinner for tonight.  Her daddy and I wanted to eat taco salad tonight which we found out she hates, so we had to give her a different dinner.  I figured a hot dog would suffice.  She's never had a hot dog, but she apparently enjoyed the couple pieces I fed her while I was cutting it up.  Well, when it was on her plate, she didn't want much of it.  She picked out her rice to eat, and had a few pieces of the hot dog as an after-thought or mistake.  I'm not sure.  One thing we are sure of is that she LOVES rice, just plain white rice.  I'm thinking of giving her rice at the end of a meal instead to entice her to eat more variety. How would I have guessed that food with flavor is not as yummy as plain white rice to this girl?  I mean, she likes spiced pork chops, but even that doesn't match up to rice.    It is amazing how quickly she learns though.  She found out today where I store her animal crackers, and she was quick to drag me (by pulling my finger) back to the cabinet when she wanted another one.  She's learned quickly that pulling my finger will get me to go places with her.  So far her list of places to take me have been: cabinet with animal crackers, gate to go up the stairs, kitchen to get to the refrigerator, swing to play in, and front door to put on her shoes and go outside.

       We had fun at the Obon festival in Japan Town today.  They had lots of games for prizes including Bingo, a Japanese bookstore, and lots of Japanese food.  My hubby and I love Bingo, but we weren't sure if Faith would let us play.  We were able to play 3 quick games of Bingo (That cost us only $1 per person) before Faith got bored and we went to walk around some more.  I played a game called "HI LO" and my hubby played "Tic Tac Toe".  We both got really close to winning but... Well you know what the ultimate result is when I said "close" :-)  We all ate dinner there.  I had California sushi and udon.  My hubby had beef teriyaki and samples of malasadas and ahi poke.  Faith absolutely loved the beef teriyaki and had loads of it and she also had some udon noodles.  The malasadas and poke samples were actually not part of the festival but were being handed out by a restaurant nearby.  That was the most exciting part of the excursion for me... discovering that there was a restaurant ( urlLink Hukilau ) nearby that sold local Hawaiian food ... and not only that but local Hawaiian food made well!  As least I'm told by my hubby.  He loves poke and had both his and my share of the sample poke.  What women give up for having a baby huh?  Well it won't be many more years before I can have all the poke I want.  Their  urlLink menu  looks yummy though and we definitely plan on going in the restaurant sometime for a meal.    Other more Faith related news... the past week or so, Faith has discovered the game of "horsie" with her daddy.  She knows how to get on once her daddy is on the ground.  In fact, now her daddy can no longer just lay on the carpet to nap...Faith just attempts to get horsie time every time he's there!  Once, her daddy was kneeling on the ground and hugging me.  Faith saw that (her daddy kneeling) as a chance to get horsie, and she quickly ran to him and climbed on his back waiting for him to move!  It was adorable, and impressive that she climbed on him.  Well not so impressive I guess when you consider that climbing is a daily (actually when she's not sleeping, it is at least an hourly) activity for her.  She holds on pretty well and can even sit up, but she also really enjoys the act of getting on and falling off her daddy once she's on top, then getting back on.  Here I have a picture of her just relaxing on her daddy's back.

       We had a lot of activity going on today in our household.  It started with my hubby taking Katie to her vet for her  urlLink dental cleaning .  Poor doggie had to fast since last night after her dinner.  No food at all for nearly 24 hours!  That's tough for our little doggie who always has food on the mind.  She got to drink water until she left for the vet, but they probably didn't give her much, if any, water there because they were worried about her having an upset stomach after the anesthesia wears off.  We were instructed to not give her any food or water until after 6pm today to avoid upset stomach issues too.  Not only that, we have been recommended to only giver her wet food as a treat since wet food is not good for her teeth.  We were also recommended to brush her teeth once a week.  We're not sure how to do this since Katie doesn't even like to let us look at her teeth, but we will look into the possibility next time we're at the pet store.  Poor doggie, today was just not a fun day for her.  We also had a pest control guy come in today to help us take care of a termite issue.  We scheduled it for today since we knew Katie would have a place outside of the house for several hours.  This also meant the rest of us had to be out of the house.  The termite guy came a little before lunch, then we went to my OBGYN office for an appointment.  We ate out for lunch, then my hubby had to go into this office to get a ton of work done while Faith and I went to one of her weekly playdates.  I guess Faith and I got the good end of the deal today :-)  Faith had a lot of fun at the playdate, but she got extremely tired by the end since she couldn't get a decent nap from all the errands after we left our home before lunch.  She usually has a long nap shortly before the playdate, but didn't have much opportunity for it today.  She did make up for it by taking a long nap after the playdate.  She took most of her nap in the car in her daddy's work parking garage since we were still waiting for him to finish up work there.  I had a nice nap in the car too... again we got the good deal of the bargain compared to her daddy.  Poor guy, he's pretty tired out today from an early wake up, all the work, and no time for nap.  After daddy was done at his office, we picked up Katie from the vet and then went home to quickly make dinner because Faith was VERY hungry for dinner by then.  Long day, but now Katie has VERY clean teeth and we (hopefully) no longer have a termite issue in our home.

        Faith has been doing more and more silly things lately which is just so much fun to watch.  Some examples include her learning to walk backwards, sideways, crawling on all fours (feet and hands, not knees and hands), turning her head upside down to look at us upside down, and spinning herself on the ground (turning in circles with her feet).  Here is a picture of another funny thing she experimented with today...maybe she got tired of feeding herself with a fork and her hands or maybe she just wanted to try something new.  We'll never know, but it was hilarious watching her bob her head several times into her bowl to retrieve food with her mouth.    Other news today.. she did a weird sleep thing where she woke up at 6:30am all awake and ready to play.  However, by 7:10 or so she started looking sleepy and she went down for a nap around 7:40am.  Woke up two and half hours later!  So would you call that a nap or just an interruption to her night's sleep?  I'm just happy I got to sleep that much longer too when she napped :-)  We napped on our guest bed which is a normal queen size bed and is about 2.5 feet high.  I didn't want to walk back up stairs to her crib.  I woke up a few minutes before she did so that I could make her breakfast.  So when she woke up, she was alone on the bed in the room.  She didn't make any noise when she woke up, she just got herself off the bed, pulled open the door (I left a slit so it wasn't closed), and ran to the living room to find us.  I was surprised, well maybe not very surprised, but surprised she didn't cry at all for us to get her when she woke up.  I guess she was very comfortable in the guest room since that is where her  urlLink Kangaroo Climber  is.  She didn't nap much during the day, just one 40 minute nap.. but I guess we couldn't have hoped for much since she slept in so long in the morning.  She went to bed at her normal time.

        Faith loves playing with Katie's cans of dog food in our kitchen.  Lately she has tried stacking them, which is an activity we encouraged --- I mean she could be doing a LOT worse things in the kitchen!  Well today, she decided to really go far with her stacking ambitions.  Her best is 8 cans... her only fault is being short (I guess that's not so much her fault as her parents' genes!)... if only she could reach higher, she could make a taller tower!  She stacks with her  urlLink stacking cups  too, but that is harder for her than the cans of dog food because her cups are various sizes whereas the cans are all the same size.  It seems the cans are a good stepping stone to more complex stacking :-)

       Faith did a lot more on her second 4th of July celebration than her first one a year ago :-)  We had intended to take her to the festival in downtown San Jose called the " urlLink San Jose America Festival " but on the way there she fell asleep in the car, so we figured we'll turn around and go home instead of disrupting her nap.  It turned out to be a short nap, and we figured a longer nap was still in store for her, so we waited for her to have lunch, and have a longer nap before heading out the festival again.  The festival was lots of fun...we bought an early dinner there walked around the different shops.  We also rode the train together in their Kidland.  The best part was taking Faith on the ferris wheel.  It was a ferris wheel meant for the kiddies, so only I went on with Faith while her daddy watched from below.  Faith loved the ferris wheel...she was scared in the beginning when the seat we were in wobbled as it started turning, but she quickly adjusted and loved staring out the window to look at everything around her and to look at her daddy.  After that, we felt she had a full experience for a 1 year old and went home.    She finished her dinner after we got home, and looked so tired ... and took another nap for the day.  It was under an hour for her nap, but that meant she wouldn't go to sleep at her normal time around 9:30pm.  We figured that was fine since it meant we get to take her to see the city fireworks show!  Can't say she loved the show, but she did enjoy it.  She stared it most of the time, but got distracted once in awhile by people talking around her, cars moving on the street, and a doggie that was on it's walk.    All in all, she had a full Fourth of July day and we all had a nice weekend.  I hope you had a great weekend too!

       I don't have any big theme for today's entry... just random thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you know, when I say that it means I'm most likely not going to make a whole lot of sense... so here goes.  &nbsp;  I proctored a test for Princeton Review again today...a proctor cancelled on them last minute and I was more than happy to get paid for sitting around for under 4 hours and getting some reading done while saying "put your pencils down" and "you may begin the section now" every so often.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, proctoring is when I get the most reading done.. it is when Faith does not come trying to take my reading material away :-)&nbsp; I am so proud I have caught up with all my magazines finally after proctoring 3 times this month and I even started on the book " What to expect, the toddler years ".&nbsp; I really liked the " What to Expect"  series from reading the  "... when you're expecting"  and  "... the first year"  so I figured  "... the toddler years"  one will also be helpful.  &nbsp;  I learned quite a bit just reading the 13th and 14th month chapters of the book including how to introduce Faith to crayons and play clay.&nbsp; I always thought these creative toys would have to wait till she's older because she likes to put everything in her mouth, but the book gave ideas on how to teach her it is not for eating :-)&nbsp; So I'm thinking of trying that as soon as we buy some non-toxic crayons.&nbsp; Incredible that they make those things so kid friendly huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember using crayons and seeing the words "non-toxic" on them before and not really understanding why that was such a big deal.&nbsp; Now it makes complete sense :-)&nbsp; And is Elmer's glue non-toxic too?&nbsp; I still can't get over hearing some of my friends in school tell me they used to eat glue when they were in second grade.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was told&nbsp;this&nbsp;back when I was in 7th or 8th grade I think!&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those gross thoughts that just hung around in my mind...gosh...I have no idea how I will react if Faith ever decided to eat glue!&nbsp; She did try dirt the other day we were outside.&nbsp; I couldn't get it off her hands fast enough before she got it in her mouth.&nbsp; Luckily, she didn't think it tasted very good, and I was able to dig almost all of it out of her mouth.&nbsp; Maybe I got it all...I don't remember seeing her swallow or chew :-)  &nbsp;  Oh, back on to the book...I also like it because it sort of helps me settle some questions in my mind like "is what she is doing normal" (such as motor and language development)&nbsp;.. and also comforted me to know that I am feeding her a good amount and that I am being pretty good on nutrition.&nbsp; I mean this is stuff I figured I was doing right, and am told by others I'm doing it right, and even similar to how I know lots of mothers do it but it is always nice when a respected advice book also tells me that I'm doing okay.&nbsp; I'm just one of those people that needs lots of reassurance I'm doing things okay...It's a horrible thing about me, this insecurity.&nbsp; But you know, I have this whole life that is dependent on decisions my husband and I make for her!&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a lot of responsibility for someone who picked her career partly based on the amount of lives it can&nbsp;destroy (near zero).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a person that could never live a sane life working in the medical field!  &nbsp;  Okay.. on to more interesting matter.&nbsp; My little girl.&nbsp; To add to my last entry... she also likes lau lau, another Hawaiian dish!&nbsp; I mixed in lau lau leaves and meat with her rice for dinner today and she nearly finished everything in her bowl :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; It's been a&nbsp;easy day for me... my hubby took&nbsp;care of&nbsp;her all morning while I was proctoring and she was napping after I got home so that is even more quiet time.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;we went out&nbsp;for a family walk while Faith held Katie's leash.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she had a good dinner and we had a small family outing to&nbsp;Costco and Jamba Juice.&nbsp; Now she's in bed... all in all a very&nbsp;easy and relaxing day.  &nbsp;  I'm writing too much.. so that's it for my random thoughts for the day :-) Hope you had a nice day too!

       Faith is a little local Hawaiian girl at heart :-)  For food anyway, she seems to like the "local" food :-)  She loves rice (okay, that's also an Asian thing), noodles (of all kinds that we've tried), kalua pig, mango, papaya, teriyaki nori (seaweed), teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, and the latest addition to her dinner variety we found out she loves is SPAM musubi!  Since we've found out she likes nori and rice, we've been wanting to try her with SPAM musubi.     Well, we decided tonight is as good as any and so when I made SPAM musubi for my hubby and I, I also made miniature musubis for Faith.  Her musubis were rolled (like sushi) and the same thickness as your normal pointer finger.  Then I cut it into little slices so that it would be bite size for  her.  She loved it!  She had over half her meal just begging me while I was still slicing!    Yay!  She loves another meal that my hubby and I love :-)

       So I skipped two days of writing on this blog... now that I've said that it doesn't seem like such a long time but I've been feeling guilty as if this is a sign that things will now go downhill and this will turn into yet another journal that ends up in a lost journal land.  That guilty feeling is what I depend on to keep myself writing...so please make sure to make me feel guilty if you want me to write more often.  Otherwise, I may forget I ever had a blog!  Anyway, the past few days have brought mostly good news.  So I'll start with that.  Faith came down with a 102 F temperature and we figured she has an ear infection.  Last two times she had a temperature that high, it was an ear infection.   Her temperature was also 1 degree higher in one year than the other, which was another clue.  So I brought her in to her doctor expecting to put her on another 10 days of antibiotics, and getting another round of diarrhea as a side effect of the antibiotic.  The good news ... here it comes...is that her ear infection this time compared to previously was only considered to be in medium condition (not severe like before) and her doctor thought she could fight back without the antibiotics.  So no antibiotics and she is all better now!  So we're very happy that our little girl's immune system was able to fight off the ear infection on its own!  Another bit of good news.. I had gotten a call from my OB/GYN office last Thursday informing me that my initial pregnancy blood tests showed I have gonorrhea.  Oh you know it, it will all be okay later in the paragraph because I said "good news" :-)  So anyway, of course that bit of news came as a complete shock not only to me and my hubby, but also my nurse midwife... afterall, gonorrhea is ONLY known to be sexually transmitted.  And the last time I had this same test was for my last pregnancy (which came out negative!)... so the results were a bit unbelievable to say the least.  The nurse midwife felt I should get re-tested so I had to go in for another pap (that was the junk part).  Anyhow, she had the original lab re-run their test and also had sent my new sample to another lab.   As it turns out the re-test at the original lab showed their original results were wrong.  My OB office apologized for the mistake and told me that original lab is a new lab they have been working with... and now they're on bad terms ... for obvious reasons!  "So what's the bad news then?", you must be thinking, since I said "mostly good news".  Well, if you have been reading my blog since when I first started posting, you'll know I contested a  urlLink parking ticket  I got.  Yup, I was rejected and will have to pay $27.  I could request an "Administrative Review"...I'm not sure what that means.  What I had was an "Initial review."  I figured it wasn't worth much more argument for $27, so I'll just pay for that darn ticket.  The rejection basically said "chalk marking visible, no exceptions".  Oh well... at least I tried.

       I had started a post earlier that is not being published because I felt I was complaining for way too long for anyone to want to hear.. so here's a shortened version for viewing.  It started with Faith waking up over 2 hours earlier than she had been waking up lately.  I brought her to bed with me hoping she'd fall back asleep but it was hopeless.  So I brought her to the living room, gave her milk, and let her play for awhile.  And boy did she play.  I was exhausted of course, not expecting the early wake up (having gone to bed later than usual, I slept under 4 hours), but what else could I do but let her pull me around to every place she wanted to play in the house?  She was not an unhappy kid, actually she was quite happy ... just more energy than I would have liked at that time of the day :-)  She finally got tired two hours after she woke up and we took a nap together in the guest bedroom.  We slept for about an hour and 40 min.   We went to a birthday party/playdate today.  She was an endless little ball of energy at the party.  If she wasn't bullying other kids out of their toys, or taking it off their hands, she was dragging me around various parts of the house.  She's normally a very happy kid that likes to give things to others.. I don't really mean share, but she likes to pick things whether it be a toy or other household object and hand it to other people.  But lately she's develop a little bully attitude and pushing other kids away from toys or taking the toys right out of their hands.  It was not very common until today's party.  She's also developed a jealousy streak where she tries to push the other kid away if I'm holding another kid, then claims me for herself.  Okay, that does make me feel a little loved :-) but not really something I want to encourage in her.  So I got a bit tired out by constantly trying to give back toys she took and attempting to teach her she has to share.  She also got hungry during the playdate since she didn't have her full lunch.  Now, you would think if she's hungry, it would be easy to feed her the yogurt cup.  Not so.  She wanted to eat snacks that belonged to another kid instead.  So it was a little struggle, but I got the yogurt in her.  I offered her some cake from the party, but she wasn't interested (the kitchen cabinets were more interesting!)  Quite a bit happened after the playdate while we were at home that involved me accidentally suffocating my husband in dog shampoo fumes (he's alive, a bit light headed I'm sure, but he's doing okay.. so I'm not a murderer) and Faith wanting to watch me cook but me not having a free hand to hold her while I'm cooking made for a very unhappy and sad baby (she was hugging my legs and screaming while looking at me with the most accusing "how can you not pick me up" face).  Things got way better when dinner started and she had a good dinner (spam musubi and bean sprouts).   Then our friend Eric came over and she had a great time playing with him.  And while we were having an improving day as the night grew with Faith being a happy girl, we received good news on very important progress with my husband's work and she was easy to put down for bedtime.     So not the best day, but it ended well and really ... how much can you hope for from life but a happy ending?  I'm a happy mom and wife.

       Okay, I've figured it out.&nbsp; My outlet is NOT broken, the problem is back with my rice cooker.&nbsp; Apparently the rice cooker caused a short on the outlet, which then shut itself down, explaining why my blender didn't work while connected to it.&nbsp; I figured this out when I decided to test my rice cooker with another outlet and it caused a huge spark and&nbsp;that outlet to shut itself down too.&nbsp; For a second I hated myself for breaking an extra outlet...then the bright light turned on in my head --- " Hey, why don't I reset these outlets by power cycling from the circuit box?"&nbsp;  I figured it was worth a try, I mean all I had to do was flip two switches (one for the first outlet, and one for the second).&nbsp; And boy was I happy when I came back in the kitchen to find both outlets in perfect working condition again.&nbsp; So, there I was, back to needing a new rice cooker.  &nbsp;  So when my hubby came home from work this evening, we went out to do a bit of price shopping for different rice cookers and right now we're planning on getting the  urlLink Tiger JAE-A18U Microcomputer-Controlled Rice Cooker (10 Cups) .&nbsp; It is $119 at Fry's and I'll be going back to buy it tomorrow.&nbsp; We were hoping to get it cheaper at a local Chinese market but it turns out that all the rice cookers are more expensive there.&nbsp; We decided to get this high end rice cooker in hopes that we won't have to buy another one in a long, long time.&nbsp; It does have the warmer feature which we enjoy especially when I make soup and want to keep it warm in the cooker.  &nbsp;  Since we had to go out to shop for the rice cooker, we also ate out today.&nbsp; We had Vietnamese noodles, Pho.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was Faith's second time eating pho and she loved it even more this time than last time.&nbsp; Plus, this time, she also enjoyed lots of noodles, some of the meat, broth, and raw beansprouts.&nbsp;&nbsp; My hubby and I were surprised how she kept on eating and eating without trying to toss food over the side.&nbsp; She rarely eats any vegetable that is not pureed, so the biggest surprise today was probably how much she enjoyed the beansprouts. &nbsp;It was a very nice, peaceful, and clean eating out experience today :-)

       I need to apologize to my rice cooker.. it looks like it did not quit at all.&nbsp; It turns out it was my outlet that quit on me instead of the rice cooker.&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered my mistake this morning when I attempted to use the blender with the same outlet.&nbsp; So now I have a different problem...The best outlet for two of my most used counter appliances (rice cooker and blender) no longer works so, at least temporarily, I need to move them to a different counter! &nbsp; My mind, thanks to Eric's comment,&nbsp;is now&nbsp;wondering if I should attempt to fix the outlet problem on my own... we do have two electrical engineering degreed folks inside this household...and if Eric wants to offer his help.. that makes three electrical engineers :-)&nbsp;

       Our rice cooker broke today!&nbsp; Now if you know my household, you know this is a major deal because we use this appliance just about every single day.&nbsp; I'd say about the only days we don't use this is when we eat out for dinner.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I use my rice cooker for the obvious use of cooking rice, which by the way is a favorite dinner item for Faith.&nbsp; I also use the rice cooker to steam a variety of foods to eat with rice and also make chicken soup.&nbsp; I haven't made chicken soup for a long time and decided to make it tonight.&nbsp; It is really convenient to use the rice cooker because I can just toss in the chicken, mushrooms, peanuts, carrots, and water, and viola... 2 hours later I have yummy chicken soup.&nbsp; Well, you may have guessed it by now, the rice cooker died about midway through making my soup today.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, it decided it doesn't want to cook anymore.&nbsp; Maybe it felt a year and half of work deemed it worthy of retirement?&nbsp; I think  not! &nbsp; I know other rice cookers have worked a lot longer and still did not just quit.&nbsp; So I apparently have "hired" a bad cooker.&nbsp; And I really have myself to blame.&nbsp; This is the second one of its exact kind I bought about 3 years ago.&nbsp; Except when that one died, I blamed myself for breaking it.&nbsp; I refuse to take the blame this time.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm sure I will want to cook rice tomorrow, so that's my only plan for tomorrow.&nbsp; I intend to buy a good one this time.&nbsp; My mom suggested the Tiger brand which I've checked out but it costs a whole lot more than your average rice cooker.. like at least twice as much (and about&nbsp;4 times as much as my current broken one when it was new!)!&nbsp; But I will look into it more seriously now since it appears it will save me money in the long run.&nbsp; I'm also considering buying a small rice cooker and a separate slow cooker or crock pot.&nbsp; I have never used a slow cooker or crock pot before so I'm not sure if it is worth buying.&nbsp; What do you think?

       We recently drove from our home to Las Vegas to meet up with my in-laws for 4 days.  This is not the first trip of this kind, we drove to Vegas back in January to do the same thing.  Of course, back then Faith was only 7 months old and she is now nearly 14 months old, so we weren't sure how the drive would go.  Both times we decided to drive during her bedtime ... basically driving all 8-9 hours during the night and showing up in the morning at Vegas.  We are lucky that Faith sleeps very well in her car seat and both trips she did wonderfully.   So that's the trick for us, make sure she's ready to sleep for a long time before starting on a long road trip!  Another uncertainty with this trip was how Faith would react to being alone with her grandparents.  Last time we tried to leave her alone with them while we were in Vegas, she was a very unhappy baby.  7 Months old was right about when she developed separation anxiety and did not like us leaving her at all.  And as far as we know, she still does not like being left by us.  The major difference this time though, is that she has spent two good months bonding with her grandparents while we were in Hawaii.  And we were a bunch of happy parents and grandparents when she gave them a huge smile when she first saw them in Vegas.  She hugged her grandpa almost immediately during breakfast and just had a great time playing with them.  And, here's the most wonderful part for us, she was willing to be alone with them while my hubby and I had alone time to gamble!  With the exception of our Alaskan cruise back when she was almost 3 months old (where she was young enough to be happy with her grandparents babysitting her for parts of the cruise), my hubby and I have not really had the opportunity to just leave her with someone else while we went off on our own.  So we were very grateful and thankful for Faith having grandparent time every single day we were in Vegas!  She enjoyed spending time with her grandparents so much, she would sometimes protest when she saw *they* were leaving her!    Everyday all of us would do a little touristy thing to check out something on the strip together and Faith enjoyed all of these excursions.  Then later in the day she would get a stroller walk with grandpa and/or grandma.  The long road trip was tiring, but my hubby and I caught up on sleep whenever Faith napped.  It ended up being a wonderful trip in all aspects... Faith had a great time with her grandparents, we had a great time just being with family and also being alone to enjoy some non-baby time, and her grandparents had a great time being with their grand-daughter and also winning at Vegas!

       My hubby, Faith, and I went on a road trip from our home to the final destination of Austin, TX and back from July 22 - Aug 5.  Seems like a silly decision to make considering it is during some of the hottest days of the year and we were heading through southern states known to be very hot ... greater than 100 F.  But we wanted to make several stops along the way so it seemed better than flying to several places, and it was the only time of the year that all of us could make time for the trip.  So on with the trip it was and we completed it!  We are thankful we have a very flexible and a good little girl who was patient enough with us to go through with it.   Faith's Travel Experience  Faith has traveled a lot for a 14 month old.  For this trip, our stops between home and Austin, TX were Las Vegas, NV - Tucson, AZ, and El Paso, TX.  On the way back, we went through El Paso, TX - Tucson, AZ, and Big Bear, CA.  So I'll add that to her list of travel experiences:  6 weeks old - Reno, NV (by car) 3 months old - Portland, OR (by car) - Seattle, WA (by car) - Various cities in Alaska (by cruise ship) - Victoria, Canada (by cruise ship) 6 months old - Los Angeles, CA (by car) -- included Disneyland! 7 months old - Las Vegas, CA (by car) 10 mo - 11.5 months - Various cities in Japan (by air to Japan, then by tour bus) - Oahu, HI (by air) 14 months old - Road trip with stops in Las Vegas, NV - Tucson, AZ - El Paso, TX - Austin, TX - and Big Bear, CA  Upcoming trips - Southern CA in Disneyland, San Diego Zoo, and Wild Animal Park - Princeton, NJ and Philadelphia, PA  That's lots of travel even if you're not an One year old!  Some people may think we're crazy but it made a lot of sense to travel when she was younger because she slept a lot in the car back then, and now is the time when I don't have a strict work schedule with limited vacation time, and my hubby had more flexible travel time also due to family leave.  The road trip was harder than all the other trips, but as I mentioned earlier, Faith was better than we expected during the trip.   We made sure to drive mostly during either her bedtime or naps.  It was easier for us and better for her to just drive when she was sleeping.  When she was awake during the car ride, she'd either just sit and wait patiently, or play with her toys we had in the car, or complain for us to let her out.   This trip, she had two friend with her on the road, Philly and Bevo.  They have become her favorite toys at home to hug and carry around so we thought we'd bring it on the road.  Philly is her bedtime buddy, and Bevo is her daytime buddy.  She found both to be great comfort especially during the car trips.    Las Vegas, NV    As mentioned in a previous post, we stopped in Vegas to meet up with Faith's grandma and grandpa.  She had a wonderful time with them and we went sightseeing on the strip everyday.  We visited Mandalay Bay, MGM, Circus Circus, Coca-Cola store, and M&M store.  Faith enjoyed seeing lions close up in MGM and playing in the midway game area in Circus Circus.  She played a game where you roll 6 balls into lanes marked with numbers 1-6. You win if you totaled under 11 or over 29.  She came real close to winning by getting 28 one time!  I think she came closer than I ever did on that game! Imagine how well she'll do when she knows what's she's actually doing :-)    I got lucky in Circus Circus and actually hit the right place in a dart game with my one attempt and won a huge and huggable floppy ear dog!     Tucson, AZ  We stayed at a timeshare resort in Tucson, World Mark at Rancho Vistoso, both times we stopped there.  It was great and had a full kitchen plus washer/dryer.  It was basically a fully furnished home and Faith loved running around in it.  It was also fairly babyproof so we didn't have to worry about her running out of sight in there.  Since it had a full kitchen, we could buy our own groceries to make dinner which we took advantage of.  Much easier to eat while letting Faith run around than keeping her tied down in a restaurant.  Poor girl was tied down enough while in the car!  While in Tucson the first time, we shopped at a great little second hand toy store and also visited the Tucson Children's Museum.  On our return leg, our second time stopping in Tucson, we visited with my best friend, Melissa and had a great time just hanging out at the resort, in air conditioning, away from the heat.  She got to see Faith at her best and worst.  She was extremely happy and playful at times.  But that was also probably Faith's fussiest day on the trip and most likely because she was starting to really get tired of going so many places so often.  Poor girl.. we were only 2 days away from home at that time.       El Paso, TX  Our first stop in El Paso was only for about 3 hours because we needed to get on the road again to drive to Austin.  That drive, from El Paso to Austin, was a hard drive because it thunderstormed on us for about 3/4 of the drive.  Thunderstorm and night time driving do not go together very well!  But our second time around at El Paso, the drive went better and we spent a full day at the city.  We visited their biggest indoor mall and Faith enjoyed it so much she fell asleep and we brought her back to the hotel where she took a 3 hour nap!  And that was before we even got to take her into the playarea inside the mall!  So after the nap, we took her back to the mall for the playarea and she had a great time again.     Austin, TX  My hubby and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary while in Austin.  We celebrated by going to Trudy's restaurant, and old favorite while we lived there.  The food was as good as we remembered and we had a great time.  Faith enjoyed their food too :-)  The most fun for Faith in Austin was playing with Kalena and Kai, two big kids who were wonderful with her and played with her so much!  Faith loves it when big kids play with her and after our stop in Austin, I have noticed her looking longingly at other older kids hoping to get them to play with her :-)  Kalena and Kai were great at making Faith laugh and giggle all over the place.  When she woke up each morning in Austin, she'd be content playing in the room until she heard one of their voices, then she would demand I brought her to the same room they were in so that she could play with them :-)  It was so much fun to see them playing together.  Kalena and Kai are 7 and 6 years old and were very patient and understanding with letting Faith play with their toys, sometimes nearly destroying their toy.    Faith got her first big boo-boo this trip.  About 5 minutes before we left Austin, TX she was running around and ran into a piano chair.  She bumped her forehead and got a huge lump above her left eye.  She normally isn't fazed by falling and even if it was a sore fall, she usually stops crying in less than a minute.  This bump caused minute s  of crying... though I'm not sure if that was caused more by the pain or her annoyance with us trying to keep ice on the lump for 5 minutes.  I say this because we have one tough little girl who's been through a lot of falls without even a glance back.  Poor thing, that bumpy stressful event seemed to help her fall asleep faster though on the car ride.  Luckily the bump was barely noticeable by the next day.  This is partly because it is covered by her bangs.  You can still see a little bit of it now, about 4 days later but it doesn't seem to bother her that it's there.  I hope this is the worst she'll have to experience but I know that's hoping for a lot... especially from a girl as adventurous and active as her.   Big Bear, CA  Big Bear was our last stop before returning home.  We've never been there before so it was fun to see a new place and we stayed at another timeshare resort there.  The lake was very pretty.. but the drive up took longer than we expected.      Is this a sign she will she be easy to potty train???   We confirmed on this trip she just doesn't poop while sitting in the car -- either because she is THAT good with holding it in, or she is not capable of pooping while in the car seat.  How do we know this?   We know she normally poops in the morning, especially after breakfast if she hadn't pooped before that.  And one morning as we were closing in on Big Bear, she was getting very antsy in the car and very screamy.  We figured it was either she needed to poop because she hadn't pooped yet, or she just wanted to be out of the car ... or both :-) So we went on a turnout with lots of space for her to walk a little and stretch her legs.  We were stopped there for less than 10 minutes and within that time, she pooped in her diaper.  With all the driving this trip, she has NEVER pooped in the car -- usually it would be shortly after we get out of a long car ride.  I've noticed similar trends even during our regular routines at home so I felt that one experience at the turnout proved that she does not poop while in the car.  This of course was not the case when she was really young like 3 months old.  We enjoyed ourselves on the trip.. it was very tiring especially since we drove through so many nights.  My hubby did a lot of the driving because he drives better at night than me, and drives way better through bad roads.  I was also more tired than normal due to the pregnancy... The whole trip would have probably been a lot easier on us if we stopped in some places more than one night so we wouldn't have felt so "on-the-go" so much but we're happy we did it and we survived it!    Thanks for reading...I know this is a really long entry.. but then it needed to cover 2 weeks of activity!

       It's been a very long road trip the last 2 weeks and we're finally home.  It was a good trip.  There is obviously quite a bit to talk about since we were gone for so long, but I'm just feeling so tired that I decided sleep is more important at the moment.  We got home at 5:30am or so this morning and I have slept a little over an hour since then, along with trying to keep up with a very active little girl who was happy to be home.  So I will try to write more tomorrow... until then... goodnight ...zzzz.

       On Tuesday, I had a routine checkup at my OB for our second little one.  It is Thursday today, so that means our second one is 13 weeks old in the tummy!  We got to see the heartbeat on the ultrasound at the last checkup, and this checkup was the first time we got to hear the heartbeat.  Both daddy and Faith were at the doctor's office with me, and we all waited as the doctor searched all around my tummy for the heartbeat.  I was anxious to hear it, to know that everything is going okay.  There is so little activity that I can notice on a day to day basis that my only proof I'm pregnant seems to be when the doctor tells me so and when I hear the heartbeat...so I was very anxious to hear the heartbeat at this visit... as I'm sure I will be at all future visits.  So I am satisfied now until we get near to my next appointment.. but all seems to be going well :-)  I'm not sure if this is related, but Faith took her baby monitor today and moved it around my tummy with a smile on her face.  Was she trying to imitate the doctor??  Or does she just enjoy playing with my tummy?  It'd be interesting to see how she reacts as I get bigger and bigger.

       Okay, maybe it is because I'm a first time mother witnessing these developments for the first time, or maybe it happens to all parents, or maybe I'm just weird... but more and more these past months, and weeks it seems like she is just learning and developing so quickly. And I am feeling so proud and amazed with her. Here is a bit on some recent things she's been doing:   Building blocks, stacking cups, and shape sorters  She's really trying and succeeding at putting megablocks together. Play is no longer about destroying stuff, creations are being born now! I mentioned in a  urlLink previous post  how proud I was of her stacking 8 dog food cans...she's done that so many times now (because she knows we are so happy for her whenever she does it), it is hard to be surprised by it anymore! She's also progressed to stacking different sized cups on top of each other. Slowly she seems to be picking up that the smaller cup needs to go on top-- I say this because once in awhile I see her switching the order of cups around when she ends up with a large cup on top. As for the shape sorter, the easiest for her is by far the circle. What is fun is that she's understanding to try different holes for each shape until she gets the right one that it falls through. Unfortunately, she doesn't like trying with much shapes except for the circle because it gets frustrating for her with the other shapes (they often need to have a direction change before fitting in their corresponding hole.. and she still needs further mastery of that). Once in awhile she likes the square, so that is her second favorite shape to put in the shape sorter.   Imitation of our daily life with her  It wasn't too long ago where she treated stuffed animals like random things to pick up and drop off. But recently, she's chosen certain stuff animals to be her favorites to hug and cuddle around our home (more specifically, Philly -- a build-a-bear monkey, and Bevo -- mascot for UT Austin). She even puts them on her swing to swing them, in her feeding chair so they can eat, or on her toy stroller for a little walk. The most fun to watch is her trying to put a diaper on them. She knows she doesn't know how to do it properly so she constantly requests that I show her how to put the diaper on.. and this requests can come multiple times in a row. Several times, I've caught her hiding in a corner of a room trying to figure out the diapering for herself after I show it to her.  And you know, what I've learned about myself? My patience with teaching how to diaper a stuffed animal is a lot better than my patience with dealing with a loudly screaming little girl :-)   "What's Zhat?"  In my opinion, this is her major language development so far. She says "dada" very well, but it doesn't really get directed at her dada all the time. But "What's Zhat?" or "What iz zhat?" seems like a question she likes to direct at anything she wants to learn the name of... which is a lot! If only she could say a few more words like milk or going out, then she wouldn't need to be pulling us somewhere just for us to understand what she wants :-) But I'm smart enough to know not to push it too hard, cause I'm constantly reminded from other moms that once the chattering starts.. it will never stop! So for now, I'll just listen to lots of "dadas", "what's zhat's" and various other sounds of babbling.   Improving memory  Gone are the days when I could remove her from doing something dangerous just by lifting her up and putting her down in another location. Now she knows how to run back to whatever she was doing. Is that a good memory or just a one-track mind? :-) What I found impressive was yesterday before her nap, she had left Bevo in our study area which is beyond the gates in our home. After she woke up from her nap, she decided she wanted to put a diaper on Bevo and while I had the gate open to get some milk for her, she ran to get Bevo from the study area with a diaper in hand.   Improved attention span for books  - or one book anyway   We've been reading to her since she was barely a month old, but back then she could care less what we were holding in front of her. Then she did care what we hold in front of her, but her attention span would last for maybe a page, maybe two of a book before she was off to something else. But now, she actually has picked a book she really loves from her grandma " The Little Engine That Could: Colors " and have asked both her daddy and me to read it to her multiple times in a row. More surprisingly, she tries hard to pay attention and understand each and every time we read it to her. Maybe it is because she feels she's getting close to understanding??? She also loves the " Touch and Feel " series of books...she learned about them after getting one from her grandma, and then being able to play with two more when we were in Austin, TX.  These are some of the major developments in the past month or two. I've always meant to talk about each one of them at one time or another and something else ended up being written in the blog. So here, I've gathered them together and made one long entry out of it :-) I hope it was interesting to read about...I know   I   love talking about my little girl :-)

       While we were in Vegas, early on in the road trip, I received an email from the Computer Engineering department of San Jose State University notifying me that I have been accepted into their program and that I can proceed with Advance Registration (which was ending the day after the email was sent) and that orientation will be on Aug 23.  My first reaction was happiness that I didn't need to do anymore for my application and that I was accepted. My second reaction was how different it felt from when I received my acceptance letters to college during my senior year in high school. For one thing, the application process was completely online this time around, whereas I remember loads of paperwork and envelopes last time. Also, I remember anxiously awaiting a "big envelope" to arrive in the mail. All I got this time was an email with two sentences and then a regular letter envelope in the mail with one piece of paper. It almost seemed too simple, but as my hubby (a university professor) told me, the graduate application and acceptance is very different from the undergraduate application and acceptance.  So yay! I'm going to be a graduate student...as soon as I figure out when I can actually attend a class! It may be difficult for the Fall since I will be gone for two weeks for trips. Then for Spring, I'm due to deliver our second one...so that is definitely out of the question!  I am accepted conditionally however. Since my first degree was in Electrical Engineering, I'm missing one key undergraduate Computer Engineering course. The condition I must meet is to take that one undergraduate course ( urlLink CMPE 142 - Operating Systems Design ) and get a "B" or better. Hopefully that won't be a problem. In any case, the geek in me is giddy with excitement that I'll be a student again with books and possibly fun and challenging problems to solve. The stay-at-home mom in me who has been out of work for nearly 2 years and out of school for almost 4 years is worried how I will handle taking on the student role once again.

       We returned home from the trip on Thursday at 5:30am and Faith woke up when we brought her into the house. Since it was 5:30am, I was hoping to get her back to sleep if only I kept her in a dark room...but it was hopeless the moment Katie ran to the door to greet us. Faith was so excited to see her doggie after two weeks of no doggie so she gained loads of energy to run around after her doggie. She did go back to take a nap two hours later.. her nap was for a little less than 1.5 hours which was not horribly short. But the big question was how she would be going to bed later that night and how she'd adjust back to home.  So it's been three days since then and she seems to be quite adjusted back to the house and how to get around, especially going out the front door to play outside. She also remembers the neighborhood children very well and loves to play with them. The sleep thing is another issue. Every night she's been difficult to put down. The first night, she woke up every 1 or 2 hours through the whole night and needed a little comforting to get back to sleep. She slept pretty well the next two nights but then she woke up really early in the morning. First morning, it was 7am, (expected time was at least until 8am!), second morning it was 6 am, and this morning it was 5 am. Notice the trend? It is obviously not what I was hoping for. The good part is that she has also consistently took a nap 2 hours after she wakes up each morning. I'd prefer if she just slept through, but I'll take a nap over no nap anyday :-) Speaking of naps.. she's been hard to put down for her afternoon naps too since we got back.  It's most likely that her schedule and "rhythm" got thrown off by our road trip where we had her going to bed in the car for so many nights in a row and also ended up putting her to naps many times the same way. She also slept in the same bed with us whenever we did go to sleep in a bed. And now we have put her back in her crib which is another change. Poor girl has to adjust to all these changes. She was great at Vegas, and probably would have stayed with her rhythm if we came back home afterwards, but the trip was much longer than just Vegas. I'm just waiting until she settles back to a regular rhythm at home. Until then, I'll just tell myself it could be a lot worse, like when we have a little baby again and it will be months of waking up multiple times during the night for nursing :-) And even with that...now that I am a fairly experienced mother (with the first year anyway :-)), I know and can take faith in knowing that it will all settle into a smooth schedule eventually and sleep will be peaceful again throughout the night... I just have to be patient.  A new week is about to start and her daddy has loads of work to catch up and complete. So it'll be Faith and me doing our regular routine of running little errands during the day, and going to as many playdates as we can :-) I'm looking forward to having her see her little friends again at upcoming playdate on Tuesday morning. She's been playing with older kids so much, it's time for her to get reacquainted with kids her own age :-)   Update (8/9/04 10:47 pm)  Last night (4th night) went really well!  She slept right through the night and didn't wake up until 8:10 am this morning!  Let's hope it continues!  Maybe she knew I had talked about her sleep patterns on this blog, so she wanted to make up for it! :-)
