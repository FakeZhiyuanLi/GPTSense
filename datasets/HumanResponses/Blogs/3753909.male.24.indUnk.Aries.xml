      I saw Spider-Man 2 last night at midnight.  I just couldn't resist.  I may write a full review later, but for now, here are some bullet points:  • I loved the opening scene in which Spidey has 8 minutes to deliver a stack of pizzas across town.  When he swings in to lift those two kids out of the way of the truck, all I could think was how lucky they were to have been rescued by Spider-Man.  • Bruce Campbell's cameo is very funny.  • From the first moment he's on screen, it's clear that Molina has Octavious down pat.  He looks the part and his delivery is perfect, both before and after the accident.  • If you're a fan of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, you'll be out of your seat during the scene where Doc. Ock wakes up after his accident.  Thinking back, I don't know why there would be a chain-saw in an operating room, but I sure wasn't questioning it at the time.  • Everything was more believable this time 'round.  I'm not sure if it was the lack of Power Ranger-esqe costumes, or a better performance by McGuire, but I found it much easier to believe that this  was  Spider-Man.  • I was a little sad that the web-slinging scenes, where Spidey just whips through the city, weren't as... joyful as they were in the original.  I don't consider it a negative point for the movie, since it makes sense; when Spider-Man takes to the skies, it's all business.  It was evident, and it gave more weight of the decisions Peter had to make.  • Raimi must have in his mind that Aunt May knows that Peter is Spider-Man.  That's the only way her monologue fits into the story.  • I should comment on the fight sequences, but there's just not much I can say.  Simply, awesome.  • My only fault with the movie is that, as in the original, sometimes the dialoge gets a little too "Dawson's Creek."  Perfect example (Spoiler):  The final scene between Mary Jane and Peter, when MJ is standing in the doorway, and going on and on about how she loves him and will risk her own safety to be with him.  WE GET IT!  You don't need to spell it out.  If it were  my  movie, I would have had MJ give a little explanation, only 6 seconds or so of dialoge, and then one line: "Face it, Tiger.  You just hit the jackpot."   I was dying to here her say that, and I was a little disapointed that she didn't.  Still, I'm happy to settle for "Go get 'em, Tiger."  I'm SO seeing this movie again on Thursday.

      If you know me, and I haven't proselytized to you about Firefly yet, then it's really only a matter of time.  I absolutely love this show.  More than Buffy, even (and if you know me, that says a lot).  I didn't catch the show when it was on the air, although I always meant to.  Unfortunatly, Fox killed the series in their typical fasion before I had a chance to tune in.  I don't remember what inspired me to add the first disc of the series on DVD to my Netflix queue, but I did, and watched the entire four hours in one sitting.  The next day, I ordered the rest of the series from Amazon and by the end of the week had watched the show's entire run.    When I asked my buddy Dan if he had seen the show, he remarked "Holy bad writing."  Now, most of the times Dan and I disagree on something, it turns out that he's right -- partly due to the fact that he seems to know something about absolutely EVERYTHING -- but this time I have the satisfaction of knowing that Dan is completely and unequivicably wrong.  The writing is brilliant, and you'd be hard pressed to find anybody who's given the show a fair shake and disagrees.  The characters and the world that Joss Whedon has created draws you in so deeply, that you not only will fall in love with it, but you'll want to be a part of it.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  What's the show about?  The simplest way to describe it is as a western in space; horses and spaceships: that's gist, but it really doesn't do the series justice; unfortunatly, no description I can write, really can.  Someone described it as a live action Cowboy Bebop, but although that's certainly high praise, it doesn't really give one a good idea of what the show is about.  The best description I can find at the moment comes from the guys at  FireFlyFans.net : Inspired by the Battle of Gettysburg and the Reconstruction Era of the American Civil War, Joss Whedon’s Firefly is the story of Captain Malcolm “Mal” Reynolds and his ragtag crew on the rogue Firefly class starship, Serenity, and their struggle to stay alive in the wake of a galactic civil war 500 years in the future.       "Thrust together by necessity, these disparate men and women are cowboys of the future. They're seeking adventure and the good life, but facing constant challenges on the new frontier, which test and reveal their true identities. FIREFLY is about their unpredictable lives and relationships, as well as their search for meaning in a very uncertain time."  After watching the final episode of the series, I felt empty.  There were so many great storylines set up in the first 14 episodes, yet which were never realized.  We never did find out the secret of Book's past, or exactly what the Hands of Blue guys were up to.  Most of all, I couldn't stand the thought of not being able to continue to join in the adventures of these fantastic characters.  Fortunatly, there were still the hopes of a big screen adventure, but who knew how long before we would get to enjoy that.  Well, apparently, the answer was "about nine months."  The premire of  Serenity , the Firefly movie, has been set for April 22, 2005, and I am fucking thrilled!  I'm probably going to spend all my free time until April just re-watching the series in order.  Then I'm going to start making a costume to wear to the premire.  I'm balls-out crazy about Firefly!

      I was browsing  urlLink craigslist  this morning, just for the heck of it, and I found this entry:  Ok I'm a guy    I have 2 Swedish girls from Sweden, they ariive here 3 weeks ago from Sweden.   They are staying over my house so far but I cannot have them with me because I have a girl friend.    My girl friend arrive back from her vacation and she will come to see me very soon and if she see these 2 girls in my house she will kill me.    Is there any guy in here that have extra room for these 2 girls,    These gilrs are blond and sexy, I mean real sexy and cute ages 22 and 23,   the 22 yeard old is 5 feet 9 and weights 140 pounds, she is curvey and she has nice looking breast like anna Nicole smith.    the Other one is 6 feet 2 inches tall and she is slim with killer legs.    Please note , I never had sex with them, I let them stay here because My friend Unvited them to viet NY and on the dau they ariive he told me to keep them in my house for a few days, a few weeks pass and he told me that he cannot have them over his house because his girlfriend is living with him.    Why should I do. These girls Bought their tickets until August.   urlLink Read the rest here.   It's pretty funny.  I also found  urlLink this entry  by a female MBA  who's having problems finding a job:   I am looking for a special favor not for money nor for drugs. All that I ask from you is the contact info. of your corporate recruiter or HR manger. Contact info. must include name, phone number, mailing address and e-mail address. I will not ask your name or need any of your personal info. Consumer products industry, package goods, retail, and advertising company, marketing agency, pharm/biotech or anything international is good for me.    And in return I am ready to offer you the time of your life. After you email me the information, we will arrange a time for us to meet either at my private Soho apartment or I can come to you. You can have me and do me as you please, as long as you please, as many times as you please.   Yikes.  I mean, I'm having trouble finding a good job, too, but I guess I didn't realize the lengths that some people are willing to go to find one.  It also illustrates a theory I've got about the corporate world.  I think that business is the best modern illustration of the animal nature of humans.  Relationships within companies seem to follow a model of pack mentality.  Imagine the boss as Alpha Male and the sycophantic young executive as the Omega.  When two packs meet to make a deal, it's about intimidating and outsmarting the other guy.  Here we've got a woman willing to trade sex for something that she perceives as necessary to her survival.  She's trying to join a pack, and using one of man's most basic desires to do so.

      Yesterday I got an email from cool-guy Garrett (who hooked me up w/ a  urlLink G-Mail account ).  He had this to say about something of mine he had read:  HILARIOUS!  You need to start a blog Garrett is right.  I am hilarious.   Fucking  hilarious, even.  Unfortunately, I have no outlet for my hilarity, and thus it sits unspent, in an empty Poland Spring jug at the back of my closet.  If at first glance the jar appears to be filled not with my abundant sense of humor, but instead with about $25 in change, that's because I'm a goddamn lier and I'm actually not hilarious.  Oh, and the jug only holds about $13.  I lied about that too.  The truth is, I do consider myself funny, but not  that  funny.  At the very least, I think I'm a creative guy with a job that allows absolutely no creative outlet.  I've tried to start up fancy websites before with complicated backends that I really didn't understand and always abandoned I was unable to realize what I envisioned.  With one post-script, Garrett has inspired me to try again, with a much simpler format.  I'm going to let Blogger handle the backend so I have a chance to just express myself.  I know that sounds egotistical, but it's what I need right now.  Unlike previous incarnations of Silence Now, this time I'm not setting any definitions or rules of what this is supposed to be.  It's a personal notebook that happens to be public, and that's it.

      A college friend of mine just had a baby.  Now a big group of college friends and I are planning to take a trip down to South Carolina to visit, and she and her husband are trying to arrange a traditional celebration called  Aqueeqa  for the same weekend.  All I really know about the ceremony is that it involves the cutting of someone's hair, and the sacrificing of a goat.  Then you eat the goat.    Now, when I first heard about this, I was a little nervous.  It's not that I'm an animal activist or anything; I simply have a policy about never eating anything I've met while it was still alive, especially if I'm the one who has to kill it.  During a trip to Maine while I was in high school, our hosts decided it would be fun to get some lobsters and cook them alive.  Everyone in my family posed smiling for the camera as they dangled a wriggling lobster over a large pot of boiling water.  Everyone but me, that is.  I waited outside with my hands over my ears so that I couldn't hear the lobsters "screaming."    I did kill a bird once, but it wasn't out of sport or so I could eat it.  I was 16, and I was walking home from town with a friend when we got caught in a downpour with some pretty heavy winds.  We ducked into a gas station and sat it, continuing once it let up to a drizzle.  Pretty soon, we came across a naked baby bird lying on it's back with it's tiny wings spread out to it's side.  It was barely moving, but we knew it was alive because every few seconds, it would open its beak wide as if crying out in fear.    It was clearly frightened and in pain, and leaving it to suffer on the sidewalk was too cruel.  I said to my friend, "I guess we should kill it, so it's quick."  I was hoping that if I suggested it, he would do it.    "I guess," he said.  We both stood there for a second before I realized the coward wasn't going to be the one to pull the plug.  Damn.  I picked up on of the large stones that bordered the driveway of the church to our left.  I held it out at arms length over the bird and let it go.     I missed.    It took a lot of will power to reach down and pick that rock up again.  I was afraid of having my hand too close to the thing I was about to kill.  I raised the rock up again, this time making sure that I had the right angle, and released it a second time.    Pop!

      Last Sunday I gave into temptation and picked up Spider-Man 2 for GameCube.  I've spent just about all my free time since then playing.  The structured portion of the game is actually fairly short, but it still took me quite a while to beat it, because I was constantly distracted by the huge playground the designers have built.  The island of Manhattan created by the designers is huge, and you can travel from one end to the other seamlessly.  There's always someone nearby marked with a green question mark, who will give you some task to do, but I have a lot more fun just swinging around looking for random encounters.  My favorite type is the rooftop robbery, where I like to swing in, pull an enemy to me with a webline, and throw him off the roof.  Street level fights are fun too, though.  I get so much satisfaction webbing up a thug's feet, then leaping to the nearest lamp post to hang him upside-down.  Another favorite move involves grabbing a baddy, swinging to the top of the Empire State Building, and then performing a 100+ story pile-driver onto the street below.  Amazingly, some thugs manage to survive this treatment, which is fine by me, because it means I can perform it again.  The Black Cat plays a major role in the story-line of the game.  She's constantly turning up in her tight leather outfit, trying to convince Spidey to lighten-up and have a good time with her.  I was watching my brother play the game when we witnessed an exchange that resembled the following:  Black Cat:  Why don't you let me show you a good time?   Spidey:  What did you have in mind?   Black Cat:  Do you know The Shocker? At this point, my brother burst out laughing.  Now, I've been into Spider-Man since Middle School, so of course I know that when Black Cat refers to "The Shocker," she's talking about a professional criminal who goes around dressed in a yellow quilt, and who has wristbands capable of creating powerful sonic-blasts.  My brother, who is less familiar with the intricacies of the comics, instantly thought of the term's  other  meaning.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, please turn your attention to the following image:      The Shocker   This had to be an intentional joke.  I wouldn't put it past game designers.  I'm sure they are just as lonely and overworked as those perverted animators that work for Disney.  Hilarious sexual innuendo aside, I see this game as something that I'll be playing for a very long time.  It's they type of game that's fun to play even without any real purpose.  I spent a fucking hour just swinging around on skyscrapers last night.  I've heard other people recommend the title as "Rent Only," but this is a game that I needed to own.

      I implore you all to go read  urlLink Bad News Hughes .  I love this guy's stories.  I can't think of one time that I've visited his blog that I haven't been overcome with giddy laughter.  Here's a bit of his most recent post: I sit there for a minute or two, thinking about the situation and becoming even more enraged. I grab the phone and dial. “Chris, I’m going to beat the holy living shit out of you. You’re going to wish you had never been born. I’m not even going to give you the chance to make an excuse. I’m just going to open up and start hurting you the second I see you.” Slam!  And, predictably, a minute later I dial again. “You’re going to feel pain like you’ve never felt before, you miserable piece of shit. I’m going to break every bone in your worthless body. You’ve done a lot of crummy shit to me, but this takes the cake. I’m going to beat you, and beat you, and beat you, and there’s nothing you can do.”  This pattern repeats itself for about 15 more minutes, with my invective getting increasingly violent and detailed. “I’m going to peel your skin off, Chris. I’m going to light your fucking head on fire and piss it out, and then do it again. I’m going to rip out your right eye, but leave it attached, so I can point it at your other eye, and you can watch that eye being ripped out up close and personal.”

      My brother is in a band.  The band is called NJ Sneer.  It's also sometimes called  The  NJ Sneer, but I think the former is correct.  I'm not really into hardcore music, which is what they play, but I do like their songs, even if I can't understand the words, let alone tell one from the next.  If you're into hardcore, check out their website (linked below) and download their album.  If you're live near Northern & Central New Jersey, join their mailing list for updates on shows.   If nothing else, they are great performers.  They have not yet met the basement that they could not rock the shit out of.  You know, except for when all their equipment breaks within 4 minutes of them going on,  but that only happened once.     Edit!  I checked with the band's drummer, who set me straight:    To be honest, probably one half of our sets have ended early due to equipment failure. not necessarily after four minutes, but before the end.      urlLink Click here for a glowing review of NJ Sneer  (scroll about halfway down the page)   urlLink Click here to visit the Official NJ Sneer Website

      I thought that they always had been, but I guess I didn't look too closely at the settings for the blog.  If you've been trying to comment on my posts but couldn't, you should be able to now.

      I'm reading  A Clockwork Orange . I've never seen the movie, but I did once read a MAD Magazine satire of it, so I have a very basic understanding of the plot going in. I picked the book up a few weeks ago, mainly because Borders was doing a deal where you could buy three select books and get one free.  I think this book has just about reached "classic" status. Burgess has been praised for his use of language in the book, and of course, there was a very popular movie based on it. Because of all this, I'm a little embarassed about reading it. It's not that I'm too cool to read popular fiction, but that the themes strike me as the type of thing you read in high school. If I had read the book then, I think I would have been a bit more drawn into what Burgess is saying about good and evil. At this point in my life, however, these are familiar ideas.  I guess that's why it seemed odd that the stranger sitting at the table across from mine at lunch today would ask me how I liked it. He probably expected or wanted me to tell him how great I thought it was. It is a good book, so far, even if it's not sparking any new thoughts for me, but Jesus, what am I, in your fucking book club? Like I said: the book is practically a classic. Casually asking a stranger who is 36 goddam pages in what they think of it is like trying to strike up a conversation by saying, "So, what do you think of the color blue?"  The next time I plan to read something like this in public, I'm first going to read the Cliff Notes in private. That way, when someone asks me what I think of it, I can launch into an intellectual diatribe about the symobolic nature of the author's use of semi-colons.
