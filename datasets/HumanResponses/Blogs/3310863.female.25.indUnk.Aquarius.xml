      Boy, if it's not one thing, it's 50 thousand others lately. And, now I'm in terrible pain. Seems I somehow knocked my tail bone out of place Wednesday night (I have NO idea how that happened, I had just bent over to grab something out of the fridge)...but it's pinched all the muscles in my lower back and got me suffering something horrible.  Anybody got some nice pain killers for sale? The way I feel, I'd be willing to pay top price, LOL! I tried heading to the chiropractor - I'm not big on regular doctors - and got some small relief yesterday, but the pain is back in full force today. And, what's worse? Hubby and I were supposed to go to dinner and a movie tonight, but I can't sit still for that long, especially in a movie theater chair that doesn't allow for ANY type of reclining. I know, I know...you don't care, right? :sigh: If it's not one thing, it's 50 thousand others.  :(

      First, I'm writing for the second day in a row!!  If I had been at this whole blog thing a little longer, I'd probably throw myself a party.  Two posts in the same week may not come around very often, or maybe I'll surprise myself and start writing all the time. Either way, I have a confession to make. I don't give my husband enough credit.  After writing yesterday (with tears flowing, which isn't good when I'm at work), I decided to go home and be honest about my feelings. And, like he always does, my husband came through like a saint. He admits to thinking of the loss from time to time, and feeling sad and hurt by it.  He also admits that he's probably not having as hard a time as I am with it still...but it's not his body, and wasn't his physical pain. He understood my *need* to do something special for our angel, though he's not so sure about that tattoo, lol.  He promised to help me come up with something that BOTH of us can do to honor our child...but will still support me if a tattoo is what I choose. I just want to have something that I can keep forever...something that can't break, can't get lost.  If it's a part of my body, I can always have that reminder, and I think that will make me feel better.  My hubby says it might just lead to more pain, because it's something I can't escape from.  He said a piece of jewelry, or an ornament or something can be put down or stored away during those times where I just can't deal with them...but the tattoo can't, and he's right. If there were anyone actually reading this, I would ask for suggestions, lol. Eh, I know that sooner or later someone will pop in here and get caught in my web of craziness.  Until then, I just feel good getting things off my chest.  :)

      I wonder if I should feel silly writing to myself like this. My mind calls it therapy (a very cheap form, at that)...a way for me to work through all of the grief I feel. I know that there's no one out there in cyberspace reading this, so I can be as personal as I need to about information.  But, I also wonder if this borders on some type of mental disorder. It's almost like I'm creating a friend out of blogspot - someone I can go to at any time, and tell my deepest, darkest secrets (like how I finished the jar of peanut butter once, but still stuck the empty thing back in the cabinet). Either way, I guess I should just enjoy whatever future relief I feel when I post. It's better to get things out, right?  Then let's do just that! I think I want a tattoo. I thought this before, but always ran screaming from the thought of the pain.  I'm NOT good with pain, never have been. But, I've also never found anything really worth suffering through the pain. But life these past 6 months or so has been all about pain, the kind I can't escape, that I figure a little more won't make much difference. And, I feel the overwhelming urge to do SOMETHING! It wasn't for very long...but I carried that innocent baby in my womb long enough to care for it, long enough to miss it now that it's gone, and long enough to be forever changed by its presence. Part of me feels I need to honor that precious life that was never given a chance. A permanent ink stain on my body may not be the greatest form of tribute to it, but it's all I can come up with right now that feels right. I wish I could talk to my husband about it - I wish I felt like he would understand.  He said he suffered with this loss as well, but he doesn't show it, and he makes me feel worse that I can't let go.  He doesn't say anything negative towards me, how could he? I don't tell him how I feel so that he has the chance. I like to imagine that if I explained things to him, he'd wrap me in his arms and cry with me, but I know that's never going to happen...he's not that kind of person.  And, I think I hurt more because he doesn't show his emotions. I'm never going to get over this, that's something I have to come to terms with. I just wish that it wasn't so painful.

      Well, it only took me a week to create my second installment.  That's not too bad, considering the busy week I've had.  The good news is that I'm now an official HOMEOWNER!  *angels sing my praise*.  Well, actually, the bank owns the home, but you get the point. Yes, yes...my dear hubby and I bought our first house the end of last month, and finally moved in this past weekend.  The move couldn't have come at a better time either...my mother was driving me crazy!  We've been living with her for the past few months while we finished the ever-stressful home buying experience.  She's a wonderful lady, and I love her dearly for opening up her own to us.  But, a 25-year-old married woman living with her mother is bound to drive the whole fam damily insane...and our experience sure lived up to that. But, we're past that now, living in our new house, and I can finally appreciate my mother again, which does both of us a world of good! Suddenly I feel like my life isn't so bad...and that's a new feeling for me.  But it's CERTAINLY one I don't mind having!

      I'm not exactly sure how I want to start.  I've never attempted to do anything of this nature online, and only time will tell how good of a job I do.  Neither am I sure how much I want to tell all of you about myself.  (oh, look, I'm already imagining there is someone out there reading this besides myself...how cute)   For now we'll just stick with the basics, for I assume that the more I type, the more you'll learn about me, whether you want to or not.  The name's JoyLynn, and I'm a 25 year-old, happily married woman living in the south.  And, I've had enough problems in my life to keep me busy with topics, so grab the closest bottle of antidepressants, a good, stiff drink, and enjoy my Rotten Ramblings...     (and if anyone DOES actually read this pathetic attempt at entertainment, please let me know!)

      Well, I've survived almost three months at my new job.  I cross that precious milestone next Friday, June 18th.  I so hope I get a raise!  I think I've earned it...they certainly praise me enough around here!  There hasn't week that's gone by that I haven't been told at least once what a wonderful job they think I'm doing, or how they're so glad I'm here.  And, those praises are WONDERFUL, I know that.  I'm very lucky to be praised like that...I certainly didn't get that at my previous job.  But, at the same time, the business has really picked up in these past 3 months (the company I work for now opened up in January, I started working mid March, and there wasn't alot of clients on the books.  Now it's getting harder to book appointments for the clients we have, much less new ones).  I handle all of the billing and insurance claims - they weren't getting any money from insurance before I started, so all of the insurance checks that come in now, I'm responsible for.  I don't expect anything drastic.  I mean, let's be honest, just taking this job put me at almost $2 an hour more than what I was making at my last job.  And, I don't have a ton of experience doing the type of job I'm doing now.  But, the lady whose position I took over was making nearly $4 an hour more than I am (she had alot more experience, I understand), and if they could handle that amount with the few clients they had back then...giving me .50 to $1 more an hour shouldn't be that big of a deal to them, right?!?  I certainly wouldn't turn down more, but I think that's a pretty fair amount.  But, at the same time, there hasn't been a single mention of any type or raise, or even the slightest hint that my 90 days are nearly up (and I was told in my interview that I would undergo an evaluation at my 90 day mark and coud possibly recieve a raise based on that evaluation). My mother tells me I'm worrying over nothing...that if they're praising my work that much, some type of raise should be in thier plans.  But, I'm a worry-wart, and telling me not to worry is like telling a fish not to swim. Oh well, I don't have too much longer to wait...the18th is just next Friday, and I get paid on the 25th, so I guess I should know something by then.  Until then, I'll keep working hard, and keep my fingers crossed!

       Isn't it scary how life can change so fast?&nbsp; My husband lost his grandmother this week, and it served as yet another reminder to me how little we control in our lives.&nbsp; The seperation between life and death is a mere fraction of a second.&nbsp; Now you're breathing...now you're not.&nbsp; It's scary - to me at least!&nbsp; He's doing quite well with the loss...much better than I would have thought.&nbsp; She suffered a good bit in the last years of her life, so I think he finds comfort in knowing that she's not suffering any longer.&nbsp; But, even comfort like that doesn't take away the pain of loss, does it?     &nbsp;   I had a strange dream the night we learned of her passing.&nbsp; She came to me in a dream (I guess I should state that I never really got a chance to know her that well, and because of her declining health, times when I was around her didn't allow for much conversation between us) and told me that she was bringing me the gift of a child.&nbsp; I attribute alot of that dream to the fact that her death and my longing for a child had been on my mind all day, so subconsciously, I guess they were bound to take over my dreams as well.&nbsp; But, it still fooled me into grasping at the imaginery strings of hope.&nbsp; Was this the one sign I needed and longed for that my husband was ready to conceive?&nbsp; Probably not...but that certainly didn't keep me from&nbsp;hoping it was.&nbsp; So, in a moment of stupidity, I broke down my walls Tuesday night, and I talked to my husband about trying to conceive.     To my suprise, he didn't get upset or annoyed with my questions (like I assumed he would)...and he was open to talking with me about it.&nbsp; I understand and agree with him that it would be a VERY scary thing to do...and we may never be truly ready to be parents until our children&nbsp;are grown and long gone.&nbsp; But at the same time, I don't think there's a gray area in a marriage when it comes to being ready to have children.&nbsp; Either you're ready and willing to have children, and want to take the steps necessary to conceive...or you want kids later, but for the present time still want to take the measures necessary to keep from getting pregnant.&nbsp; I'm of the former belief.&nbsp; The hole left in my heart and my soul from the child that I lost affects me daily.&nbsp; I've hurt so much, cried so much, wished, hoped and dreamed so much to fill that void.&nbsp; My husband, on the other hand, doesn't seem to feel the confidence that I do that our time is now, and obviously isn't ready to actively try to have children right now.&nbsp; And, I have to admit, that fact breaks my heart all over again.  &nbsp;  He did admit (to my utter surprise) that he had been thinking about all of this recently.&nbsp; I'm surprised because I didn't figure he ever thought about it.&nbsp; He certainly never talks to me about it.&nbsp; Although, he did say that he's still not come to any decisions about whether or not we're ready to start trying for a child.&nbsp; &nbsp;  So, when the hell did he get the overall say?

      To say that I have done a crappy job at keeping up with this blog would be giving me more credit than I really deserve.  The sad fact is that I often visit the site, start to make a post, and then close my browser and move on with my day.  Why?  The only answer I can find is fear.  Fear of facing the obvious fact that life happens and I can't control it.  That fear makes me cry...and I don't like to cry. This has been a rough month for me.  I was contacted by a previous co-worker a few weeks ago, asking me to watch her nearly 3 year old child, K.  Now, I love and adore K...and feel bad that I wasn't able to watch her that evening.  My previous co-worker isn't the best of mothers (he name for K is 'horrible monster', and the sad thing is that at 2 years old, K answers to that more often than she does to her own name), and the fact that she has 3 children under the age of 5, with another child on the way is a  hard thing for me to deal with. When I found out last November that I was going to be a mother, I began an emotional rollercoaster that I have yet to find a way off of.  I went from being scared to death to immensely happy.  I wanted that child more than anything...only to have it taken away from me enwomb at roughly 8 weeks on December 22nd (talk about an emotional Christmas!). Just days after my miscarriage, this previous co-worker chooses me to talk to, revealing the secret that she was pregnant yet again.  That was hard to hear.  But, for her to tell me that she was unsure whether she wanted to keep the baby or get rid of it before anyone had to know nearly demolished my heart and soul. The last thing I needed two weeks ago was to see her growing belly, and hear her pregnancy stories.  I'm down to mere weeks before my estimated due date, and I'm having enough problems as it is! I want to be pregnant!  I love my husband with all of my heart, but his request that we wait to try to conceive is breaking me.  I understand his worries.  He doesn't want me to have to face the loss of another pregnancy (I don't want to have to face that either, but if I don't face the possibility, I don't get a child, and I don't want that either).  I know he's worried about finances and such...true we've just bought a house, but we're not hurting for money.  If we wait until we're financially secure, we may never have a child.  I don't want to risk that either. He tells me he wants a child as much as I do, just not yet.  So, I've tried being patient.  I don't ask him about it, I don't make comments about it...I just lurk around the TTC board on Parents Place, quietly feeling the pain and agony that those women feel, and growing more and more jealous over the positive HPTs they receive.  Why can't that be me! My husband and I had this conversation in late March or early April.  So I'll bide my time until the end of the year.  But, then he needs to make a choice...either we start trying then, or I enroll us into a foster family program.  Maybe I'm crazy, but the child I lost in December has left a hole in my heart that can only be filled with another child.  I can't continue to let this hole grow, or it may just swallow me up.
