      Well.....   Today is another of the boring days to add to te list, have done basically nothing since about 10 this morning (its now 3)... Its not like i don't want to work.. there is just nothing to do....  And it frustrates the shit out of me that things change that i should know about but either i am told hours before i am supposed to do something about it, or not told and i find out from someone on a different site. My office is beside the PM but i hear nothing and am told nothing...  should just duck my head like the good little mushroom i am...

      At the moment I am still unsure as to what the hell to write in this but thought i would write something.......   I had a dream last night that had some aspects of Running Man (the Stephen King Novel, not the movie), In that someone was hunting someone else for a game, but the guy was hiding an a desert.'  The picture moved to a man stepping out of a car wearing glasses and a stilson hat and soon after the scene shows someone in a small cave tied to a chair struggling, covered in leaking wounds before he popped, before a large explosion riped through the country side... from several different areas... and just before he poped and seemed to set of the explosion came the words. "Nobody likes the smell of themselves rotting"....  The scene then cuts to what looks to be a homemade movie.  The guy that the man in glasses and stilson's was chasing draggs out a mad and throws him into a chair beside some sort of torture device. He then pushes his head sideways so his neck is puched into a big V which slightly cuts his neck. He then swings one of his legs into a series of spikes that come from the device that seems to be there for the pure purpose of stopping the person from moving to much.  The man then slowly walks around his captive, the view in the background shows a lot of desert and the man starts to wave away flies that are drawn to the blood.   He then starts to cut the man slow deliberate cuts. After the first pass the man grabs a bucket that it full of something that reaks of pestilence and then rubs it into the wounds. Then hew sews them up again, making sure some of the foul brew is caught inside.  He then repeats the process.  It then becomes clear that the man he is working on is the same one that popped earlier on, his disease and puss filled body swelling in the heat on exploding for no real reason as dreams are wont to do.  The end..  Well this dream freaked me out a bit, and i didn't sleep after that. maybe i should stop reading Dean Koontz and Watching the news....

      Well This is the first time I've done this so here goes.....  Work is giving me the shits. Not an unusual sentiment i know but true.   At certain times of the month, its not too bad, basically the few days around the end of the month are busy, but thats it.... The rest of the tmie i'm bored shitless because there is nothing to do.   Every day I have to do costings which determine how much dirt and coal is moved and how much it costs us, but that is getting taken away from me because hopefully i will be going elsewhere soon.   So here i am, ready to off load my responsibilities and go elsewhere, yet nothing has been said to me, i only assume the transfer will go ahead, and i am slowly getting less and less things to do, and getting in trouble for not doing anything.  But the bright side is, i might be getting a job in Gladdy where i live, it will be nice to go home everynight for a change instead of every weekend....  oh well enough wingeing from me for now.  bye

      Well, yet another exciting day at work, they have a replacement here for me but no one has any idea when or where I will be going. But the good news is that I am having 2 weeks off starting next week. This is so I can get married and maybe even get to spend some time with my missus.   Haven’t really been home much the past two years so will be nice to for a while.  Just wish something will happen at work, this sitting on my arse all day is driving me up the wall… still only for another 2 and a half days…..  Can’t wait…

      Had my bucks party on the weekend its now Monday and I still feel seedy, although it wasn’t a massive night, maybe still suffering from lack of sleep.  I feel old…. Although I am not that old, clubbing does absolutely nothing for me… I had more fun walking from club to club talking to a mate of mine that I don’t see that often. Other then that it was pretty shit when we went out. My brother in law, who is 4 years older then me had more fun, he didn’t get home till 5, I was home by 2……  We went to the strip club…. Have now seen 2 women naked, up close… pretty pathetic for a 24 year old I know, but I started going out with my misses before I turned 18 and I haven’t cheated on her. The second women was a lap dance on the weekend… she was about as cuddly as a steel bar, call me silly but I prefer a women with curves that’s at least a little soft… she did nothing for me…  Overall had a fairly shit night. But I did see two mates I don’t see much off nowadays…. That was the highlight…….  There was a stripper in the club who popped up on stage and started doing a routine. But for some reason all I could think about was how degrading it seemed that she was performing for all these drunk guys, but I didn’t feel the same about the Lap dance… either because it was a more personal thing or just because it was for me alone, or the way it was more of a show, maybe I’m just fucked in the head…..  Yeah probably the last one….  Didn’t watch the show. Felt disgusted and walked out. How fucked am I in the Head…..

      I am at work again, and although i have caught up with everything it actually has a feeling of accomplishment about it , mainly because the workload is higher and I keep getting extra little jobs that help break up the day.   Still miss not being home, but with the way things are at the moment I am home on fridays now before dark, (haven't done that in almost 20 months) so i get a little bit of extra time at home, which is always good.  They are talking about turning me into an engineer, which is a good thing but i am constantly worried that they are over estimating me and I will just collapse in a heap the first time they give me a real engineer type job to do. So far its mostly chasing numbers, which i have been doing for almost a year anyway.....  Thats about all that is exciting around here...   Sandra is having trouble with her mum, but that is nothing new. She continuously feels that she is the centre of attention and everything must be dropped to do whatever she asks, even if later she changes her mind... There is more, i could cary on about her and the pressure she puts on Sandra for hours, but who the fuck would like to read that...

      Well it has been about 4 weeks since the last post.   In that time I got married, spent a week and a half in bed, wich included half of one of my two weeks off.   Then I had to return to work to find that being home for three weeks straight made it harder then before to leave.  The wedding went beautifully. It was a perfect day, everyone got pissed, there were no fights or disputes and it all went smooth, so that was a blessing.  I was assured that i would get a job at home in september. Then they moved me to a different project and i will be lucky to be home before christmas but have a feeling the jib may run through some if not all of january.. not happy about that.  Especially the fact that nobody has mentioned me going back home since....
