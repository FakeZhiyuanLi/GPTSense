      My interest in insects has been heightened since getting a Nikon Coolpix 995. I grabbed these shots while on the GPOG birding [twitching] trip in Cornwall.

         I was able to borrow an adapter briefly to photograph this  urlLink Black Redstart , found by Brian Stone. The species used to breed in the city but is now just a passage migrant to the area.

      I was lucky enough to visit The Gambia with  urlLink The Gambia Experience  at the end of November 2003. Though I didn't really attempt any bird photography, I got some other pics which you can see here.     After coffee at Lamin Lodge, we set out on our 'Birds and Breakfast' excursion. This is a view from a dugout canoe on a tributary of the River Gambia at dawn. We moved silently downriver.  As we glided past the mangrove roots, we could see oysters (an important crop which is harvested by women), lots of tiny crabs and the occasional fish. Plenty of birds in the branches, as well as waders poking around in the mud.     I really wanted to see more bee-eater species after enjoying European Bee-eater  (Merops apiaster)  in Spain and Lesbos. The boat was a great way to get close to several species, including Little Bee-eater  (Merops pusillus) (above, camera handheld). After about 90 minutes on the boat, our backsides were all numb and we returned to the Lodge for breakfast...     A view of Lamin Lodge from the water. It stands on stilts over the water (or mud, depending on the tide). The mangroves are an important habitat for all kinds of wildlife. You can enjoy the view over the top of the mangroves while having breakfast. Birds visible included more Little Bee-eaters, a Bearded Barbet  (Lybius dubius)  and Red-billed Hornbill  (Tockus erythrorhynchus) .  We weren't the only ones ready for some food, though... As we sat down to brekkers, we were joined by a group of Green Vervet monkeys, who were very naughty and stole a sugar bowl as well as food from everyone's plates. I suffered the loss of two pancakes and some honey.     It was time for another cack-handed attempt at bird photography...  Pied Kingfisher  (Ceryle rudis)  was the most common member of its family that we saw on our trip (we also saw one Malachite Kingfisher,  Alcedo cristata ). We frequently saw Pieds either perched on mangroves or hovering over the water. This one stayed still for long enough for me to attempt a photo.        One of the great things about The Gambia is that you can see a huge variety of birds wherever you go, even on thhe way to and from the airport. However, there are also some special reserves to visit. Abuko Game Reserve is pretty much the epitome of African jungle that you imagine. Up to 20 crocodiles are supposed to inhabit its pools,  though we didn't see any.      The best bird was definitely Violet Turaco  (Musophaga violacea) , which performed beautifully just outside the hide - a beast and a half!     Like in other parts of the world, the forest in The Gambia is threatened, though it was good to see that steps are being taken to protect it. Makasutu ('holy forest') was a fabulous place to visit. You can also stay in its luxury lodges by the Mandina Bolong [river]. After a guided stroll through the forest, we arrived at the lodges (complete with The Gambia's biggest swimming pool!) and admired the view - what a place for a holiday!      Quite a contrast from the bustling Kotu Beach area where most visitors to The Gambia stay. No cars, no bumsters, no hassle, no beach - just the river and the birds and insects around it. Each lodge has its own dugout. The rivers and creeks in The Gambia are central to life there.     We went to meet the local Marabou (witch-doctor), but he was out. So we met his extended family instead at their hut. In The Gambia, you need to be careful not to offend when taking people's photos (they believe it steals their soul). But if you ask nicely, there's usually no problem.     We also encountered some other forest inhabitants... Muscovy Ducks get everywhere! It was time for lunch...     Dancing, singing and drumming from the Jola tribe was on the agenda after lunch, though fortunately for us Brits, audience participation was not compulsory.      We visited a school at Yakanu to bestow our precious gifts of pens, pencils, books and paper on the pupils. As you can see from the banner above the window, Desperate Dan has indeed made it as far as The Gambia! You can see hand-painted walls everywhere.     Unfortunately, the Tonyfelin Welsh Baptist Church Computer Lab was not yet up and running, but at least they had some computers (even if they didn't work...). We met some pupils and they seemed very excited, especially when we could show them their photos on the digital camera's monitor.     Unlike many schools in the UK, the pupils were well turned-out, polite and enthusiastic! These children have just started school. They're the lucky ones whose parents can afford to pay.        Everywhere we went, Gambians of all ages were pleased to meet us. Life is hard for many people, however. Though many Gambians have mobile phones and Internet cafes are abundant, lots of people still rely on the land to make a living.  We took a trip out through the bush in a huge four-wheel-drive truck to see the bush. Much more enjoyable than an air-conditioned bus - you can feel the breeze through your hair, get covered in dust, and get much better views of the countryside, people and birds.  We visited a compound - a Gambian house with yard and outhouses - as part of our trip on the truck. Everyone was very friendly and eager to relieve us of any surplus pens or paper we had! The girls in the picture below attend an Islamic school.      Though it all seemed very basic and rustic, with chickens running around, our illusions were shattered when one of the villagers' mobile phones burst into life...     Our guide for most of the week, Mr President, runs a restaurant and was after a chicken in order to become self-sufficient in poultry. He was given one, free of charge, at the compound.   The Gambia is a country full of new sights, sounds and tastes. Another visit was made to a palm plantation, where palm sap is harvested. The sap drips off into specially-positioned plastic bottles, where it ferments in the sun. Result = palm wine. You can't bring it home because it ferments and ferments and ferments and an explosion could result.  Palm wine is distilled to produce 'fire-water' -  a lethal spirit which you can take home... In the picture, Trevor the journalist is about to lose his passport as he tries to climb a palm tree in search of alcohol.     Our trip through the bush took in visits to a school and a compound and ended up on this beach, where we had another superb lunch of freshly-cooked chicken, fish, prawns, rice and vegetables. New birds for the list here were Turnstone  (Arenaria interpres) , Sanderling  (Calidris alba)  and Pink-backed Pelican  (Pelecanus rufescens).      A good way to finish the trip. If you counted all the Woodland Kingfishers on bottles of JulBrew, it would surely be The Gambia's most common bird. Most Gambians are Muslim and therefore teetotal.

         Believe it or not, this  urlLink Glaucous Gull  was actually *cough* a lifer for me. I just haven't ever gone out of my way to look for gulls in the past, but we made a special flying visit to  urlLink Prior's Fen .  I hate gulls, but I hate  urlLink Prior's  even more.

         Occasionally, it is nice to escape from the  urlLink Peterborough Bird Club area  and experience the illicit thrills of dirty twitching.  The American Robin at  urlLink Grimsby , Lincolnshire, deserved a visit so I blagged a lift there with  urlLink Steve Dudley  and borrowed a digiscoping adaptor for the day. The picture above goes to prove that even  I  can take half-decent pictures of brightly-coloured birds at close range in sunny conditions.

          urlLink Lesser Redpolls   (Carduelis cabaret)  can be hard to pin down in the Peterborough area, so I was happy to find a small flock feeding in the alders on the north bank of the River Nene, near  urlLink Bluebell Bridge . They spent quite a lot of time feeding on fallen alder cones on the ground.

      Went to  urlLink Stibbington  again at lunchtime to look for the  urlLink  Hoopoe  . No joy. There was a fantastic field full of dandelions next to the sewage works, though... looked great for  urlLink Linnet  and  urlLink Goldfinch .  I think it's time to start looking for  urlLink Dotterel  in peafields.     What's in my CD player: -  Hail To The Thief  -  urlLink Radiohead

         After the morning's excitement, I went to  urlLink Ferry Meadows  again this afternoon. A bit stupid of me really, since it's so busy on sunny weekends.   Anyway, I enjoyed the walk and took some not-too-bad photos, and watched some interesting interaction between a  urlLink Sedge Warbler  and a  urlLink Whitethroat . On the long walk round Gunwade Lake, there were plenty of fish-wielding  urlLink Common Terns  and some  urlLink Pied Wagtails  on the water's edge, plus one smart male  urlLink Yellow Wagtail . But most definitely no White Wagtails.

         I was rudely awoken from my sleep this morning by my mobile phone. I didn't recognise the number. My first dozy thoughts were a) is it Monday and should I be at work? and b) it'll be someone trying to flog me something. Fortunately, I answered, for it was Martin Coates telling me that there was a  urlLink Hoopoe  at  urlLink Stibbington . That was enough to get even me out of bed on a Sunday morning, so I woke up a bit and went to see it.  By the time I'd found my way there, a few other birders were already on the scene, including its finder, Brian Stone (he found another one at  urlLink Elton Furze  last year but it vanished and wasn't seen again). The bird was last seen poking around on the edge of an unmade track.   Of course,  urlLink Hoopoes  are famous for feeding on lawns belonging to vicars, and  urlLink Stibbington Hall , just around the corner, had what we considered a highly attractive lawn, ideal for a hungry visiting  urlLink Hoopoe . It obviously disagreed, because it popped up again in its original position and we all had a good eyeful until it flopped away.  Most people left at this point, but a few of us decided we might as well wait, since we were there now, and our patience paid off. The  urlLink Hoopoe  returned and seemed happy to feed quite close to where we were. Though it was scared off twice by dog walkers and a  urlLink Magpie , it always came back to the same spot, and the last I saw of it was when it trotted off round the corner and out of sight.  My first Hoopoe in the PBC area - what a fantastic bird! I got some OK photos of it, which you can see at the top of this post and also  urlLink  here  .

      Another post-work visit to  urlLink Ferry Meadows CP . I headed for Coney Meadow again since the park was still fairly busy.      If last Friday was the day of the  urlLink Willow Warbler , this week it was  urlLink Reed Buntings  which were singing all over the place. At least five males sang in stereo within a small area of hawthorn scrub. I tend to think of them as inhabitants of fen, rather than scrub, but I think they know what they're doing.   There were two male  urlLink Whitethroats  duelling among the brambles, too. I tried for ages to get photos of one of them, but gave up playing cat-and-mouse after a while... Nice to see them back, though.  What else was about...? About ten  urlLink Common Terns  were around Overton Lake, and it was interesting to see that two of them had  urlLink BTO -type metal rings on their right legs. A  urlLink Green Woodpecker  was very vocal along a line of oaks nearby. I finally caught up with him when he flew to an isolated tree in the middle of the meadow,  and  I got a half-decent photo!  urlLink Green Woody  is one of my favourite species. Very charismatic.      I was hoping for a repeat of last week's  urlLink Wheatear , which I now believe was of the 'Greenland' race  leucorhoa . That's a mega-migrant for you. Anyway, there wasn't one, but I did finally see the  urlLink Pink-footed Goose  that hangs about with the feral  urlLink Greylag  flock. And I got a  lovely  pic of it, too...     The  urlLink Cormorants  were on the Overton Lake island, as usual.        What's in my CD player:  Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea  -  urlLink PJ Harvey

         I meant to get up early this morning but I stayed in bed until 07:15.  Lazy.  I drove to  urlLink Eldernell  in the hope of seeing a  urlLink Ring Ouzel . It was a lovely morning, but there were none there, and no  urlLink Wheatears  either. Oh well. You can't have everything.   Instead I concentrated my efforts on trying to digiscope singing birds. I hoped they'd be sitting fairly still, but it was the usual story of birds buggering off just when I was ready to take a picture. I was all set to get what I thought would be some fantastic pics of a singing male  urlLink Blackcap , but every time I pressed the shutter, he was facing away from me! Finally, I got one half-decent image.   I don't mind. Fortunately, the Nene Washes is the kind of place where you can return, having seen nothing, and not feel too hard done by. Some of the best birds were by the car as I arrived: a  urlLink Barn Owl  floated by over the meadows, with  urlLink Black-headed Gulls  in close attendance (but keeping a safe distance). By the sluice gate on Morton's Leam, a pair of  urlLink Pied Wagtails  were a'courting.  He  was fervently bowing up and down, while  she  crouched down before seeing him off with a warning wave of the bill.

         It's been an interesting day. It didn't start promisingly, since the  urlLink Ring Ouzel  wasn't seen again after the early morning. But we had a phone call from  urlLink Will Bowell  mid-morning to say that  urlLink Josh Jones  had found a nearly summer-plumaged  urlLink Spotted Redshank  at the bizarrely-named Grummit's Scrape.   Managed to get out at lunchtime (first piece of lunchtime twitching since passing driving test). When Dr Weedon and I turned up, there was not a lot to be seen, and certainly no  urlLink Spotshank . We were despondent and on the verge of leaving the hide when we heard a  'chewit!'  Soon enough, the dusky beauty popped out from the edge of the scrape and it showed fairly well until we left.  I took some hasty pics but they're abysmal. If you want to see them, click  urlLink here  and  urlLink here . But  urlLink Josh's  are much better.  After work I went down to  urlLink Ferry Meadows , since it was such a nice evening. Had a wander around the scrubby parts of Coney Meadow, where I attempted to digiscope singing  urlLink Willow Warblers . I had a couple of near-misses: click  urlLink here  to see one. The  urlLink WWs  were fantastic. It seemed like there was one singing from the top of nearly every hawthorn bush. Of course, they all dived for cover as soon as I thought I could get a picture of them...  As I walked out of the scrub towards Lynch Lake, I glimpsed something on top of a post, which turned into a smart male  urlLink Wheatear . He vanished initially, until I rediscovered him lurking by the narrow-gauge railway. I got  urlLink a half-decent photo  (after some sharpening). Unfortunately, digiscoping was curtailed because of some  urlLink chav  wantonly kicking a football between me and the bird, flushing it. Oh well...  I'd forgotten how much I love  urlLink Sparklehorse . Highly recommended.     What's in my CD player:  Distorted Ghost EP  -  urlLink Sparklehorse

      I feel obliged, should there be anyone else reading this, to explain what  birding  is.  It's probably better known as birdwatching, the act of watching birds. Yes, blokes, you can make jokes like "I like watching birds but not the ones with feathers! HA HA HA!" but we've heard them all before and they  still  aren't funny.  A good phrase to summarise what watching birds is about is used by the  urlLink RSPB  for one of their campaigns. It's: "Aren't Birds Brilliant!" Birding doesn't have to involve vast numbers of birds, or a rare or spectacularly-coloured species, or ones with beautiful songs, though it can be any of those. It could be something as simple as watching a  urlLink Starling  probing for leatherjackets in a lawn, or a  urlLink Chiffchaff , newly-arrived from Africa, picking its way through a hawthorn bush. Or a  urlLink House Sparrow  building a nest under roof tiles. These are all fairly mundane things that you can see on the way to work every morning.  I find watching birds go about their daily business fascinating. There is so much about them that we don't fully understand. Actually, there are plenty of things that we have no idea about. How do birds navigate their way around the world? Why do some species agitate ants' nests and then wait for the ants to crawl all over them? How do birds tell each other apart? We may never know for sure.  On the other hand, spectacular birds, or ones that do odd things, are extremely interesting. One of my favourite sounds is the 'drumming' of the  urlLink Snipe . It's a small wading bird with a long, sensitive, slightly flexible bill which it uses to feed in soft ground or mud. The  urlLink Snipe  'drums' by flying high up in a display flight, then diving earthward and fanning out its outer tail feathers. They vibrate, making an audible humming noise.  Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is that birds are fascinating beings. They are constantly doing things beyond our comprehension. They are all around us. They come in many different shapes, sizes and  colours, and are adapted to just about any environment and extreme condition you can think of.   Compare penguins (ice and intense cold. Incubates its egg/chick on its specially adapted feet) and sandgrouse (desert and heat. The males carry water on their breast feathers to their young at the nest). Birds are immensely strong (eg.  urlLink Arctic Terns  spending 'our' winter in the southern hemisphere, then breeding in northern Britain; tiny warblers migrating year after year to and from Africa), and at the same time delicate and beautiful (look at the same warbler up close and you wouldn't think it capable of such a feat).  In short, birds enrich our lives and  my  life is improved immeasurably by them.

      I hope to update this page more or less daily with whatever takes my fancy at the time. Partly, it's so I don't forget what I've been doing. But it's OK for you to read as well, if you really,  really  want to.  On the right, you can see some links I've created to pages I find useful or interesting. I am a serial blogger; I think this is the third I've attempted to keep, but the others have failed (obviously). With a bit of luck I will manage to write something interesting here, now and then, but don't hold your breath.  This blog is intended to complement my website proper, which can be found  urlLink here . At this moment in time, there's nothing there, but there will be soon, so you'd better bookmark it, OK?

         I think this is my best photo to date. I was just giving up on trying to digiscope  urlLink Meadow Pipits  when this one perched on a fencepost for a few minutes.   There's always the 'do I or don't I try to digiscope it?' quandary - I seem to spend half my time carefully moving into position, only for the bird to fly off at the critical moment. Fortunately, it stayed put for several minutes and the meadow made a good background. They're very under-rated birds. I think it must have been watching flies above its head.

      Chris and I went down to  urlLink Steve Dudley's garden  with the aim of trapping and colour-ringing some House and  urlLink Tree Sparrows . Steve had counted a maximum of nine  urlLink Treeps  in the garden at any one time, so it was a bit of a surprise to catch 13! Over the next few weeks, he counted another nine which had escaped the nets, making a total of at least 22 individuals.  The  urlLink House  and  urlLink Tree Sparrows  we caught were fitted with a standard  urlLink BTO  metal ring on the right leg, and a red plastic ring on the left, as part of a research project into sparrows in the Fens. Hopefully we'll be able to do a return visit in the autumn when there are plenty of juveniles in the garden.  Other birds caught included  urlLink Song Thrush ,  urlLink Reed Bunting ,  urlLink Yellowhammer ,  urlLink Chaffinch  (at least one of which was a big, long-winged bird of continental origin) and  urlLink Dunnock . It was very interesting to see ringing in an entirely different habitat and very nice not to have to wear wellies/waterproof trousers/waxed jacket...

            Got a phone call at lunchtime from MJW who was watching a male Broad-bodied Chaser  (Libellula depressa)  at  urlLink Castor Hanglands . After a little thought I decided it would be nice to go and see it. What an insect!  There were also Hairy Dragonflies  (Brachytron pratense)  on one of the other ponds, and we nearly trod on this Glow-worm  (Lampyris noctiluca)  larva on the way out (see below). Robin Scagell of the  urlLink UK Glow Worm Survey  kindly confirmed its identity. There are no other recent records of Glow-worms from this area so it will be fascinating to visit again to look for glowing females. The survey's  urlLink website  provides lots of information if you're interested.

      I've decided that, from now on,  this blog is going to be my main website . It's just so much easier than trying to design pages in Publisher and faffing around with images. And this lovely template looks far nicer. I'll keep the other  urlLink Bogbumper  site going for now (mainly so I can upload my images to its server) but all the decent pics are on here anyway.  Now, I think I'll upload my pics from  urlLink The Gambia  and make a post for them here, but I'll backdate it to November 2003 (when I went). I'll add some other odds and sods, too.

         Drove out to  urlLink Bedford P's  this morning. Departure (from home) slightly delayed because some ignorant motorist had blocked my car in! However, while I waited for them to move, a  urlLink Hobby  swooped past my window and added itself to the garden list. Magnificent!  Once I got there, my enthusiasm was slightly dampened, so I just pottered around. Not a lot of note. One area of the wood has been fenced off so deer can't graze/browse, and the contrast between that and the rest of the site is quite dramatic. Lots of  urlLink Garden Warblers ,  urlLink Song Thrushes  etc. singing where the rest is fairly quiet.   Again, the star birds of the visit were  urlLink Long-tailed Tits  (pic above). I watched a group of six juveniles perched in one small tree (presumably one brood exploring the immediate area around their nest).  urlLink Long-tails  are extremely endearing in any case, but the juvs take cuteness to another level. Is it the little pinky eye-rings, or the soft brown and white plumage, or their daft-inquisitive behaviour?

      I'm going to try to write a race report in real time as I watch the GP. It might make it more interesting. I'll publish at the end.   13:02.  Warm-up lap proceeding as normal.  13:03.  Cars lining up on grid. Red lights off! M Schumacher retains lead, Trulli into 2nd like a rocket, Sato nearly hits them up the arse and pushes Trulli wide. Oh dear, Montoya has pushed off R Schumacher. Finito. Now Raikkonen in 2nd, Alonso 3rd, Trulli in 7th. Coulthard moved from 20th to 10th. da Matta out, too.  13:05.  M Schu streaking away already by 2.4s. Montoya pits for new nose.   13:06.  M Schu leads by 3.4s from Raikkonen now. He looks serene. Gosh, this is exciting. Coulthard 9th now.  13:09.  Where is Barrichello? 5th.  13:10.  8 seconds between M Schu and Raikkonen, after five laps!  13:13.  14 seconds now, after six laps! This could be a pretty boring race... He is lapping three seconds a lap faster than just about everyone else.  13:14.  McLarens' pace "poor", says Brundle - Raikkonen holding everyone up behind him. Who knows, perhaps somebody may attempt an overtaking manoeuvre?  13:15.  Aha. M Schu pits on lap nine. 8.3s, lots of fuel. Now he's behind Trulli in 8th. Bit of a procession behind Kimi still.  13:17.  McLaren getting ready for a pitstop, as are Renault. Raikkonen and Trulli coming in, and out again.  13:18.  Barrichello obviously has more fuel than M Schu. Coulthard misses Weedol chicane. Alonso leads from Sato, Barrichello. Alonso into pits.   13:19.  Raikkonen retires in a large puff of smoke. "Significant problem in engine department", says Brundle. Very diplomatic. Mercedes get narked if they say 'engine failure'. Sato leading race.  13:20.  R Schu says he didn't see da Matta, as he ran over his front wheel... Brundle says you can't see anything from modern cars, with their head restraints - no more than 30 degrees either side of straight ahead.  13:21.  Sato lapping in 1m30s now Raikkonen out of the way.  13:22.  Sato in, Barrichello leads. 12 laps gone.  [commercial break]   13:26.  Alonso in 11th after going wide. Barrichello into and out of pits. 9.4s, a bit slow. M Schu leads again after 15 laps.   13:28.  Klien into pits. Oh, the excitement.  13:29.  Sato is in 2nd, looking good, and ahead of Barrichello.   13:31.  Coulthard, Button, Webber, Fisichella, 4th-7th. Coulthard hasn't pitted yet. Webber stops, 8.7s. Rear tyres in a state. Michelins not working well.  13:32.  12th, Montoya, 13th, Klien. Jag driver is going to get him!  [commercial break]   13:35.  Lap 21. M Schu leads Sato by 16s. Coulthard has pitted, but not after being overtaken beautifully by Button.  13:36.  Sato pulling away from Barrichello (3rd), who is 27s behind team-mate.  13:38.  Montoya pits from 10th. Stop of 8s. There's an aerial camera which follows him down the pitlane.  13:39.  Fisichella (5th) has not pitted yet (he started from back after engine failure). M Schu 17s in lead. Sato and Button (BAR) lapping in mid-1m30s.  13:40.  Fisico pits on lap 24 - 10.1s.  13:42.  Button pits.   13:43.  Sato pits from 2nd, now behind Barrichello.  13:44.  Coulthard has smoke coming out back of car. Parking it. Oh dear. Home race for Mercedes. Mechanics getting ready to pack up. Car has neither speed nor reliability. 8th retirement out of 14 starts this year!  13:46.  M Schu, Barrichello, Sato, Trulli, Alonso. Lap 28. M Schu pits - 8.2s.  13:47.  Klien has passed Montoya, but JPM now trying to get him back. Actual racing! Eeek! Klien passed by Massa as well.  13:49.  Coulthard and car returning to pits on back of truck (not a Mercedes).    13:50.  Lancaster bomber and two Spitfires just flew over SW. Seriously impressive.    13:52.  Six seconds between M Schu and Barrichello (who's only stopped once). 28 laps to go.  [commercial break]   13:58.  Gap now 10s. Will Sato catch and remain ahead of Barrichello, who needs to stop again?  14:01.  Brundle says Klien is so small he "looks like a kid who's hotwired a car on the estate". Barrichello pits - 10s. He's just ahead of Button now.  14:08.  Montoya pits from 8th place. Sato is 17s behind Schumi, and 19s ahead of Barrichello, but needs to stop again. He needs about 21s to get out ahead of Rubinho.  14:11.  M Schu pitting - 7.9s. Sato pitting - 7.3s. What will happen??? Barrichello keeps 2nd. The chase is on.  14:13.  Sato and Barrichello have made contact! He's ahead for now, but part of someone's car has fallen off. A bit reckless. Oh dear. Sato's front wing is broken. That's not the way to do it. Serves him right...  14:15.  Sato pitting for new nose. Not a quick one... 14.5s. Rejoins in 6th. Button is 3rd.  [commercial break]   14:18.  Lap 49 - Sato's engine has exploded. Oh dear oh dear.  14:20.  Observation: Ross Brawn looks like a funny kind of beetle with his headphones and their aerials on.   14:22.  M Schu, Barrichello, Button, Trulli. Nine laps to go. Button is chasing Barrichello. He has 12s to make up. Can't see it happening.  [commercial break]   14:27.  Button 9s behind Barrichello, with 6 laps to go. Having trouble passing a Minardi.  14:35.  One lap to go. Nothing has changed. Trulli 5th, Alonso 6th.   14:36.  M Schu wins, Barrichello 2nd, Button 3rd, Trulli 4th, Alonso 5th, Fisichella 6th.  [commercial break]

      This morning I was woken at 05:45 by a text from Mike 'Early Birder' Weedon which said:   "Blak [sic] tern @ maxey now 5.45am. M"   I neeeeeeeeeed  urlLink Black Tern  for  urlLink my PBC area list . That was enough of a stimulus to get even me out of bed. I grabbed my scope, bins, camera etc. and set off.   I arrived at  urlLink Maxey  at 06:15 (it would have been sooner if I hadn't gone the wrong way - twice). There was no sign of Weed, and worse still, no bloody terns! I waited around for more than a hour, in the vain hope that they might come back, but there was no sign.   After that bitter disappointment, I went to  urlLink Castor Hanglands  (I'm a sucker for punishment), and had my best-ever views of  urlLink Grasshopper Warbler . I heard one reeling as I got out of the car, and decided to have a wander up the track to look for it (it sounded close, but they can be quite misleading). Scanning around, I soon saw it sitting low in a tree. After watching for a while, I decided it was worth a digiscoping attempt.      Hardly worth it, but it's fun trying. It's not easy to understand how  urlLink Groppers  sing. They just seem to sit there, open their bills and somehow the mechanical sound spills out. The only sign of any effort is the vibrating tail.  Also at CH were a few  urlLink Turtle Doves , a couple of  urlLink Cuckoos , and a  lot  of young birds.  These Common Spotted Orchids  (Dactylorhiza fuchsii)  made a nice display.     This flower is pretty, but I don't know what it is...            Update:  Mum says it's Goatsbeard,  Tragopogon orientalis , otherwise known as Jack-Go-To-Bed-At-Noon.

      To the south of Peterborough city centre, there used to be an important Great Crested Newt colony, and unique ridge-and-furrow habitat (created by the clay extraction for the local brick industry) which was important for insect and plants. Now, much of it is being 'developed' to accommodate Peterborough's share of the hundreds of thousands of new houses that Britain will be building (somewhere) over the coming decades.  Yes, Hampton is here. It really irks me that the land being developed is always referred to as "derelict brickworks" - as if there's nothing of any worth there. There seems to be a presumption that brownfield land cannot be of any worth to wildlife, which is incorrect. There was an excellent feature in the  urlLink Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough's  recent newsletter which explained exactly why Hampton is a terrible example of insensitive development (I hope to quote some bits from it here in future - when I find my copy).  In the  urlLink Peterborough Evening Telegraph on Wednesday , there was an article about the latest round of development at Hampton which has just been approved by the  urlLink city council . That prompted me to look at  urlLink Hampton's official website , which was quite illuminating.  Looking at  urlLink 'The Masterplan' , you can see just how committed the developers are to wildlife and the environment by the amount of land they have designated a nature reserve. A tiny fragment of land, compared to the vast swathes of housing, industry and 'open space' (what does that mean - manicured, landscapes Teletubbyland?) they have allocated space for. The website talks about how 9% of the area will be a nature reserve - is that like Crown Lakes Country Park at Farcet, where native vegetation had to make way for aesthetically-pleasing, alien planting? [ urlLink Waxwings  seem to like it, though]   urlLink     Still, at least Hampton will be good if you like to see  urlLink Canada Geese...   In the  urlLink ET's piece yesterday , Roger Tallowin, director and general manager of O + H Hampton (the developers) "promised the relentless increase in housing – the firm is currently aiming to see 500 built each year – will not overshadow its environmental principles.  "He said: "We are maintaining the concept of having plenty of green areas. "It is very much a green project – both figuratively and literally.""  I remain to be convinced.

         I've realised I can't really draw birds properly so I might as well go down the stylised route to mask my inadequacies. It's a sort of representation of last month's  urlLink Hoopoe  flying up the Nene valley.  This was inspired by  urlLink Carry Akroyd , except she does it infinitely better than me, of course. I love her swans especially.

         Click  urlLink here  to read about ringing and for useful links.  An early start this morning for my first proper ringing session at  urlLink Ferry Meadows  this year. Chris, my trainer, had told me that when he visited the site last week, there had been water in places that reached above his knees! I have now ordered a pair of waders, but it's still a waterproof trousers, wellies and waxed jacket job, as usual.  Fortunately, the water level had dropped by this morning, leaving lots of deep, sloppy mud to contend with. At this stage in the season, the vegetation on the site (lots of willow carr, reeds, rosebay willowherb, nettles etc., plus my favourite, water mint) isn't too high, but it grows at a terrific rate and before long there'll be stingers taller than I am!  Chris was onsite before me and had the mist-nets up in record time. Altogether, 40 birds were caught in the nets during the morning (22 of which had already been ringed previously) - not a brilliant total, but considering the weather conditions (breeze and bright sunshine make the nets more visible to birds), not too bad.  A male  urlLink Great Spotted Woodpecker  was certainly biggest and noisiest catch of the day (photo above). Other species trapped included  urlLink Sedge  and  urlLink Reed Warblers ,  urlLink Blackcap ,  urlLink Garden  and  urlLink Willow Warblers ,  urlLink Long-tailed  and  urlLink Blue Tits ,  urlLink Blackbird ,  urlLink Robin  and  urlLink Bullfinch . Two  urlLink Reed Buntings  were also noteworthy since they don't appear in the nets very often.  As a trainee, I'm on a steep learning curve. It takes many hours of practice, patience and perseverance to learn to ring birds. It's not easy and I'm still learning the skills and particular dexterity needed. Hopefully I'll get there eventually!  While it's a fascinating privilege to see birds up close, what I find most interesting of all is the phenomenon of migration. It's humbling to know that the tiny  urlLink Sedge Warbler  you've just released has been flying back to the same site from sub-Saharan Africa for the past four or five years (read a bit about  urlLink Sedge Warblers  here). It might only weigh 12g!   How does it find its way, which route did it take, where did it go, what did it see on the way...  A  urlLink Nightingale  singing from near the site was slightly unusual for  urlLink Ferry Meadows .

      My  urlLink Lambchop  fascination reached new heights, last night, when I had a vivid dream about being on tour with the band.  As with most dreams, I only can only recall bits and pieces of it, but I distinctly remember having to share a bed with  urlLink Tony Crow  (presumably due to budgetary constraints) and being looked after by  urlLink Deanna Varagona  - she restrung my guitar and bought me lunch.  I think I am going mad. I haven't had dreams about my favourite bands since I was 16. Somebody help...     What's in my CD player:  Lifes Rich Pageant  -  urlLink R.E.M.

      I forgot to write about my evening out on Monday. It was infinitely more enjoyable (from my point of view), than last  urlLink Thursday  (too much pizza + cheesecake + small but not very potent quantity of alcohol =  intense  nausea).   Anyway... Got to site. Sat down. Waited until the correct time. Watched hunting  urlLink Long-eared Owl  in the golden evening light as it glided past - unperturbed by human presence - only metres away: orange eyes, ear tufts, distinctive wing markings, moth-like, deep, soft wingbeats - the works! Owlets squeaking away from the nest site nearby.  Magic.     What's in my CD player:  Rings Around The World  -  urlLink Super Furry Animals

            Went to  urlLink Bedford Purlieus  for a morning stroll. I was really hoping for  urlLink Lesser Spotted Woodpecker  but since I didn't know where they were meant to be and it's a pretty big site (208 hectares, whatever that means), I just decided to wander about in the hope of bumping into something.  The pic at the top is of three juvenile  urlLink Long-tailed Tits  which were being fed by their parents. There was no shortage of food - caterpillar poo (or  frass , as I believe it is known) was literally raining down from the canopy!    This beastie is a longhorn species called  Rhagium mordax  (click  urlLink here ).  It's a fantastic wood, full of singing birds (I heard  urlLink Nuthatch ,  urlLink Goldcrest ,  urlLink Coal Tit ,  urlLink Garden Warbler ,  urlLink Blackcap ,  urlLink Whitethroat ,  urlLink Song Thrush ,  urlLink Mistle Thrush ) and a wide range of flora. I was fortunate enough to meet Bob and Emily, who were on the lookout for slow-worms, and they let me tag along for a while. Looking under pieces of corrugated plastic, we found two - one small and one large (picture below). Never seen one before so it was quite exciting.

      Here is my  urlLink Peterborough Bird Club   urlLink area  list so far (190 species), plus notes (where I can think of something interesting to write) and links to pics. Again, this is mainly for my benefit, before I forget where I've seen things. Like Little Stint. Where the heck was that?   urlLink  Red-throated Diver  : a wonky-billed, winter-plumaged bird was on the River Nene near  urlLink Dog-in-a-Doublet  in mid-May 2003.  urlLink  Black-throated Diver  : the first bird in the PBC area for 15 years turned up on the River Nene in February 2003.  Little Grebe : one trying to swim upstream by Town Bridge in the city centre (2000/2001) the only vaguely notable sighting (there was heavy flooding at the time).  Great Crested Grebe   Black-necked Grebe   Manx Shearwater : a bizarre but fabulous find by  urlLink Josh Jones  at  urlLink Baston & Langtoft GP  in 2003.  urlLink Cormorant   urlLink  Shag  : one at the River Nene  urlLink Dog-in-a-Doublet  sluice from mid-Dec 2003 into early 2004. Went to see it on its first day. Some other birders (strangers, not local) were also there. They tried to tell us it was a Cormorant and went away disappointed. Ha.  urlLink  Bittern  : it took me about 13 visits to  urlLink Woodwalton Fen  and  urlLink Eldernell  in late '02/early '03 before I saw one of the bloody things. But it was worth the wait.   urlLink  Little Egret  : saw my first one at  urlLink Eldernell  in early 2002. Mike Weedon shouted "Little Egret!" I didn't believe him - it was more likely to be another wind-up. But then I saw some yellow feet disappearing behind Lord's Holt. That was all.   urlLink  Grey Heron    urlLink  White Stork  : enjoyed great views of 'Marge' the stork at Lord's Holt on the morning of April 2, 2003, having had crap, distant views on the High Wash the previous day. The bird had a strange wing pattern, making it easily recognisable, and was found dead in a ditch in Cambridgeshire later that year.  Mute Swan   Bewick's Swan   Whooper Swan   urlLink  Pink-footed Goose  : saw a large skein of Pinkfeet fly over  urlLink Crown Lakes Country Park , Farcet, on Waxwing Day, Jan 10, 2003. And there's a dodgy one that lives at  urlLink Ferry Meadows ...  urlLink  White-fronted Goose  : slogged out to my least favourite site on the planet,  urlLink Prior's Fen , to see a family group of Greenland White-fronts in with the Greylags there (the third Cambs record). Then some more showed up at  urlLink Castor Meadows , which was much nicer.   Greylag Goose   Canada Goose   urlLink  Brent Goose  : one took up residence for a short while on the Nene Washes during 2002 (see pic). Then there was the comedy Wild Brent Goose Chase of March 2003: Brent reported from  urlLink Baston & Langtoft GP .  urlLink Steve  comes to pick Mike and I up from work and we zoom up there at 10,000 mph. No bird. Then, a call from Brian Stone to say he's got one at  urlLink Ferry Meadows ! Drive back there. Odd.  Egyptian Goose : must be the dirtiest, most nasty, plastic bird on my list. Two horribly inbred looking things on the banks of the  urlLink River Welland . Putrid. But if everyone else is ticking them, so must I...  Shelduck   Mandarin : the only bird I found at  urlLink Belham Wood  that anybody else actually went to look for. Best view was of the pair sitting up high in an oak tree. I also saw them (presumably the same birds) further up the Werrington Brook near Marholm church - they could be the  urlLink Castor Hanglands  birds, too.  Wigeon Gadwall Teal    urlLink  Green-winged Teal   : probably the same, returning bird seen on the Nene Washes (2002) and at  urlLink Dogsthorpe Star Pit  in 2003.  Mallard Pintail Garganey Shoveler Red-crested Pochard : another filthy tick, but if they're good enough for everybody else...  Pochard Tufted Duck   Scaup : a nasty march out to  urlLink Prior's Fen  on a dull December day in 2002 (I think).  Goldeneye Smew   urlLink  Red-breasted Merganser  : twitched the  urlLink River Welland  birds in April 2004.  Goosander Ruddy Duck Red Kite:  used to brighten up my bus commute into Peterborough.  Marsh Harrier : one flew low over my head at one site; fantastic display flight at another site; most interesting sighting was probably a female battling against northerly winds as she flew over  urlLink Orton Brick Pit  in spring 2003 - definitely a migrant.  Hen Harrier : only seen two (both ringtails), both on the Nene Washes: one on the Green-winged Teal day in 2002, and another there in late April 2003.  Goshawk : one over  urlLink Eldernell  in early 2003.  Sparrowhawk Buzzard Osprey:  watched one fly NW from  urlLink Prior's Fen  in 2003 in the direction of  urlLink Welland Bank Pits , where it was duly seen by William Bowell!  Kestrel   urlLink  Red-footed Falcon  : the well-watched, long-staying Deeping Fen bird of summer 2003.  Merlin Hobby Peregrine : the wooded, ever-so-slightly hilly area between Bretton and Barnack became known (to me, at least) as Raptor Alley after I caught sight of one on a lunchtime birding excursion.  Red-legged Partridge Grey Partridge Quail : after managing not to hear one at  urlLink Woodwalton Fen  in 2003, went to a fly-infested  urlLink Thurlby Fen  instead and succeeded.  Pheasant Water Rail  urlLink Spotted Crake  : saw the  urlLink Ferry Meadows  bird in 2002 before hearing them singing on the Nene Washes.  Moorhen Coot Crane : Dan Williams' 'Crane from the train'  urlLink near March  in March 2003 was a lifer!  Oystercatcher Avocet Little Ringed Plover Ringed Plover  urlLink Dotterel  : went to see the trip near  urlLink Great Raveley  in 2002; co-found another trip on  urlLink Blackbush  in May 2004.  Golden Plover Lapwing Sanderling Little Stint Temminck's Stint : Brit-ticked the  urlLink Welland Bank Pit  bird of May 2004.   urlLink Pectoral Sandpiper  : got to see the autumn 2003 bird at a private site.  Curlew Sandpiper Dunlin Ruff  urlLink Jack Snipe  Snipe Woodcock  urlLink Black-tailed Godwit    Bar-tailed Godwit : a pair on the Nene Washes caught me unawares.  Whimbrel : still haven't seen one in the area! I must rectify this!  Curlew  urlLink Spotted Redshank  Redshank Greenshank Green Sandpiper : one over the garden in the dark.  Wood Sandpiper : found my first one on the High Wash in August 2003.  Common Sandpiper   urlLink  Grey Phalarope  : got very muddy for one at a private site on Valentine's Day 2002.   urlLink Little Gull  : a bird race tick at Hampton in 2003.  Black-headed Gull Common Gull Lesser Black-backed Gull Herring Gull Iceland Gull : finally nailed it at Eye tip on February 15, 2004.   urlLink Glaucous Gull  : a naughty working hours twitch on January 30, 2004, leading impressionable work experience student astray.  Great Black-backed Gull Sandwich Tern : the 'picnic' of nine at  urlLink Ferry Meadows  in 2003.  Common Tern Arctic Tern Black Tern:  At last! Finally nailed what was becoming a 'bogey bird' at  urlLink Welland Bank Pits  on  urlLink 07.06.2004 .  urlLink  White-winged Black Tern   : flight views of the WBP bird in July 2003.  urlLink  Guillemot  : more seawatching at the  urlLink Dog-in-a-Doublet  in September 2002.  Feral Pigeon Stock Dove : ringed a pullus in 2003.  Woodpigeon Collared Dove Turtle Dove Cuckoo Barn Owl Little Owl Tawny Owl Long-eared Owl Short-eared Owl : managed to evade me in 2003, for some reason!  Swift Kingfisher  urlLink Hoopoe  : went to see the  urlLink Stibbington  bird found by Brian Stone on April 25, 2004.   urlLink Green Woodpecker  Great Spotted Woodpecker Lesser Spotted Woodpecker : ticked in  urlLink Bedford Purlieus , spring 2002.  Sky Lark Sand Martin Swallow House Martin Richard's Pipit : another Nene Washes bird.   urlLink Meadow Pipit  Water Pipit Yellow Wagtail Grey Wagtail : a notable garden tick (two adults, two juveniles)  urlLink  Pied Wagtail    urlLink  Waxwing  : another lifer in the PBC area, on January 10, 2003, at  urlLink Crown Lakes Country Park , Farcet.  Wren Dunnock Robin Nightingale : click  urlLink here  for Nightingale anecdote.  urlLink  Black Redstart    Whinchat : ticked on a lunchtime birding outing on the Nene Washes, 2002. Not seen in 2003 but bagged on the bird race 2004. Hurrah!  Stonechat   urlLink Wheatear   Ring Ouzel : star bird of bird race 2002.  Blackbird Fieldfare Song Thrush Redwing Mistle Thrush Cetti's Warbler : showed well in a very flooded Lord's Holt, Nene Washes, in January 2003.  Grasshopper Warbler Sedge Warbler Reed Warbler   urlLink  Dartford Warbler  : another unlikely Brian Stone find at Stanground Wash, December 2003. Coincided with some others in East Anglia.  Lesser Whitethroat   urlLink  Whitethroat    Garden Warbler   urlLink  Blackcap    Chiffchaff   urlLink  Willow Warbler    Goldcrest Spotted Flycatcher Bearded Tit Long-tailed Tit Marsh Tit Willow Tit : seen and heard at  urlLink Bedford Purlieus  in bird race 2002. Practically extinct in Cambs now.  Coal Tit Blue Tit Great Tit Nuthatch:  one of my better garden ticks.  Treecreeper   urlLink  Great Grey Shrike  : came back from a day in Norfolk to see the bird on the Nene Washes!  Jay Magpie Jackdaw Rook Carrion Crow   urlLink  Hooded Crow    Starling House Sparrow Tree Sparrow:  PBC-ticked on  urlLink Eldernell Lane , but since handled 13 when helping ring birds in  urlLink Steve Dudley's  garden.   Chaffinch Brambling:  first heard flying over a bus stop in 2002!  Greenfinch Goldfinch Siskin Linnet   urlLink  Lesser Redpoll    Crossbill : found three at  urlLink Castor Hanglands  in (I think) August 2002. That was a Lesser Spot day, too...  Bullfinch Hawfinch : went to pay homage to the sickly bird outside the  urlLink Ferry Meadows  office window in 2003, but the male at  urlLink Castor Hanglands  in 2004 was much preferable.  Yellowhammer   urlLink  Reed Bunting    Corn Bunting   Interesting but not on my list is the  Night Heron  I saw on the Nene Washes at dusk one evening last year. There are (or were) up to three birds of captive origin roaming the area, meaning any genuine migrants that turn up will be condemned to the feral dustbin!

      Went to  urlLink Welland Bank Pits  yesterday evening in search of the  urlLink Temminck's Stint . Fortunately, just as we were arriving,  urlLink Will Bowell  had relocated it and we were able to view it from next to the pet refuge (to the accompaniment of various animal and bird noises).   I saw them on Lesbos last year but hadn't in the UK - until now.  Hahahahahahahahahaaaaaaa!   urlLink        What's in my CD player:  Automatic For The People  -  urlLink R.E.M.

      Yes, of course, with the application of Sod's Law, it was a  urlLink Temminck's Stint  at WBP. Well done to  urlLink Will Bowell  for finding it. It's just about the only night I couldn't go out after work and see it. I hope it hangs around... I  neeeeeeeeeeed  it for a  urlLink PBC  (and British!) tick.

      Just finished an enormous mountain of work and have heard about a possible  urlLink Temminck's Stint  at  urlLink Welland Bank Pits . But, even though I have a car, I cannot go for it because I'm going out! Gaaaaaaaaaahhh! Hopefully, it'll turn out not to be one, then I won't feel like I've lost out...

      OK then, here's a systematic list of the species our team - Willo The Wispers - saw at the weekend.   urlLink Little Grebe   urlLink Great Crested Grebe   urlLink Cormorant   urlLink Grey Heron   urlLink Mute Swan   urlLink Greylag Goose   urlLink Canada Goose   urlLink Shelduck   urlLink Wigeon   urlLink Gadwall   urlLink Teal   urlLink Mallard   urlLink Pintail   urlLink Garganey   urlLink Shoveler   urlLink Red-crested Pochard   urlLink Pochard   urlLink Tufted Duck   urlLink Ruddy Duck   urlLink Red Kite   urlLink Marsh Harrier   urlLink Sparrowhawk   urlLink Buzzard   urlLink Kestrel   urlLink Red-legged Partridge   urlLink Grey Partridge   urlLink Pheasant   urlLink Water Rail   urlLink Moorhen   urlLink Coot   urlLink Oystercatcher   urlLink Avocet   urlLink Little Ringed Plover   urlLink Ringed Plover   urlLink Lapwing   urlLink Dunlin   urlLink Snipe   urlLink Woodcock   urlLink Black-tailed Godwit   urlLink Whimbrel   urlLink Redshank   urlLink Common Sandpiper   urlLink Black-headed Gull   urlLink Lesser Black-backed Gull   urlLink Herring Gull   urlLink Great Black-backed Gull   urlLink Common Tern   urlLink Arctic Tern   urlLink Feral Pigeon   urlLink Stock Dove   urlLink Woodpigeon   urlLink Collared Dove   urlLink Turtle Dove   urlLink Cuckoo   urlLink Little Owl   urlLink Tawny Owl   urlLink Long-eared Owl   urlLink Swift   urlLink Kingfisher   urlLink Green Woodpecker   urlLink Great Spotted Woodpecker   urlLink Skylark   urlLink Sand Martin   urlLink Swallow   urlLink House Martin   urlLink Meadow Pipit   urlLink Yellow Wagtail   urlLink Grey Wagtail   urlLink Pied Wagtail   urlLink Wren   urlLink Dunnock   urlLink Robin   urlLink Nightingale   urlLink Whinchat   urlLink Wheatear   urlLink Blackbird   urlLink Song Thrush   urlLink Mistle Thrush   urlLink Grasshopper Warbler   urlLink Sedge Warbler   urlLink Reed Warbler   urlLink Lesser Whitethroat   urlLink Whitethroat   urlLink Garden Warbler   urlLink Blackcap   urlLink Chiffchaff   urlLink Willow Warbler   urlLink Goldcrest   urlLink Spotted Flycatcher   urlLink Long-tailed Tit   urlLink Marsh Tit   urlLink Coal Tit   urlLink Blue Tit   urlLink Great Tit   urlLink Treecreeper   urlLink Jay   urlLink Magpie   urlLink Jackdaw   urlLink Rook   urlLink Carrion Crow   urlLink Starling   urlLink House Sparrow   urlLink Tree Sparrow   urlLink Chaffinch   urlLink Greenfinch   urlLink Goldfinch   urlLink Linnet   urlLink Bullfinch   urlLink Yellowhammer   urlLink Reed Bunting   urlLink Corn Bunting

      Here is the long-awaited account of the 2004 birdrace, which my team (Willo' The Wispers) were joint winners of. I know you're simply gagging to read this heart-rending tale of extreme birding endeavour... If you're a member of  urlLink Peterborough Bird Club , then you can read it in the next issue of  Limosa ,  so don't get too excited.  For a list of the species seen by our team, click  urlLink here .   The annual GPOG birdrace is keenly anticipated by the participating teams and regarded as a frivolous activity only for fools by other birdwatchers. The team that sees the largest number of species between 6pm on Saturday and 6pm on Sunday wins. Teams have four members, and three of the four must see (or hear) the bird to be able to count it. With less than perfect weather for the race, life for the teams was going to be tough, and the competition was much closer than usual. But how close? Read on and find out.    The time:  18:00 hours  The place:   urlLink Nene Washes , Cambridgeshire There was bedlam. It was the start of the 2004 GPOG birdrace and someone had just shouted "Cattle Egret!” Confusion reigned supreme. Who, what, when… where’s it gone? Some observers saw it but many others didn’t. Enough said! For more, it’s best I refer you to the Peterbirder e-mail archives at:  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/peterbirder   None of our team members - Brian Stone,  urlLink Steve Dudley , Kevin Du Rose and myself - saw the bird, but we decided we couldn’t hang around all night - we had other birds to chase and after all, under birdrace rules, a Cattle Egret is only worth the same as a  urlLink Chiffchaff … Before leaving the washes, we mopped up all the usuals, plus bonus birds such as  urlLink Pochard ,  urlLink Dunlin ,  urlLink Wigeon  and  urlLink Garganey .  On the drive round to  urlLink Eldernell , we added stuff like  urlLink Collared Dove  and  urlLink Blackbird , arriving at 19:06 and ticking off  urlLink Red-legged Partridge ,  urlLink Stock Dove  and  urlLink Pheasant . A  urlLink Lesser Whitethroat  sang from the hedge on the walk to Lord’s Holt, as did  urlLink Blackcap ,  urlLink Willow Warbler  and  urlLink Wren . From the barrier bank, a drake  urlLink Pintail  was visible on the flood - something we didn’t get anywhere else. Our last bird at Eldernell was a pair of  urlLink Ruddy Ducks  picked up by Kevin on the pit (20:25) - top spotting!  By 20:57 we were near  urlLink Woodwalton Fen , where we got our only  urlLink Little Owl  of the race. The hour from 21:02 to 22:02 saw us add  urlLink Woodcock ,  urlLink Nightingale ,  urlLink Tawny Owl  and  urlLink Grasshopper Warbler . Would we have got extra points if that  urlLink Long-eared Owl  had actually perched on Kevin’s head, instead of veering away at the last moment? A tip-off from the non-GPOG Cambs Diehards meant we hung around at the entrance - they'd just heard a  urlLink Quail  there, distantly. The 501s were also there, and we presumed they were doing the same thing, but as it turned out, they weren't! None of the GPOG teams got  urlLink Quail  in the end.  A return visit in the dark to the Nene Washes yielded nothing more than  urlLink Oystercatcher  and  urlLink Water Rail  (22:54), unfortunately, so it was back to Steve’s for a curry!  Total so far: 64 species.   Next morning...   A later-than-anticipated start saw us cross  urlLink Magpie  off the wanted list at 05:17, and it was off to the Nene Washes again, where we got lucky and heard a  urlLink Whimbrel  at 05:41. Next stop:  urlLink Black Bush Drove , for  urlLink Corn Bunting ,  urlLink Pied Wagtail ,  urlLink Yellowhammer ,  urlLink Wheatear  (06:16),  urlLink Linnet  and  urlLink Grey Partridge  (three pairs, where on several pre-race recces we’d seen none!).  From there, it was a short hop back to  urlLink Farcet Fen  for the resident  urlLink Tree Sparrows , plus  urlLink Greenfinch ,  urlLink Song Thrush  and  urlLink Swallow , and we headed east to  urlLink March Farmers  where we hoped for waders, but only got  urlLink Blue Tit  (07:01). C’est la vie… The drive along the North Bank gave us  urlLink Common Tern  and  urlLink Great Crested Grebe , with  urlLink Little Grebe  and  urlLink Feral Pigeon  added at  urlLink Dogsthorpe Star Pit  (08:17).   It was a real stroke of luck to bump into Tony Parker on his local patch in the Car Dyke/Newborough/Peakirk area. He put us onto  urlLink Kingfisher , as well as a smart  urlLink Whinchat  on Drain Road (08:30) - nobody else got that!   A quick tour of  urlLink Ferry Meadows  netted  urlLink Chiffchaff ,  urlLink Garden Warbler ,  urlLink Goldcrest  and  urlLink House Martin , plus  urlLink Arctic Tern  (09:24). A lucky visit to  urlLink Grimeshaw Wood , Bretton (10:01) brought  urlLink Spotted Flycatcher . ‘Bet nobody else will get that', we thought, smugly. Wrong - all teams saw  urlLink Spot Fly . Oh well.  A drive-by  urlLink Ringed Plover  at  urlLink Hampton  was the 97th bird on the list, before we drove west to  urlLink Morborne Hill  for  urlLink Red Kite  (11:30), then  urlLink Grey Wagtail  at  urlLink Elton , and  urlLink Old Sulehay , where we saw  urlLink Buzzard ,  urlLink Common Sandpiper ,  urlLink Sand Martin ,  urlLink Bullfinch ,  urlLink Coal Tit ,  urlLink Treecreeper  and  urlLink Marsh Tit  (12:29), but still no  urlLink Nuthatch !  From then on, it was a fairly slow afternoon with  urlLink Jay  and  urlLink Sparrowhawk  at  urlLink Castor Hanglands  (13:32),  urlLink Little Ringed Plover  at  urlLink Maxey GP  (15:05), then  urlLink Red-crested Pochard  (16:27) and  urlLink Turtle Dove  (16:57) at  urlLink Baston & Langtoft GP  and  urlLink Deeping Fen  respectively.  We finished up on 111 species, which meant we (Willo’ The Wispers) drew with Just A Hobby (Trevor and Jane Williams and Eunice and Neil Parker). If we’d only got  urlLink Quail ,  urlLink Barn Owl ,  urlLink Hobby ,  urlLink Nuthatch ,  urlLink Short-eared Owl ,  urlLink Mandarin  or  urlLink Lesser Spotted Woodpecker , it could have been so different!  THE END   Went to  urlLink March Farmers  last night, on the lookout for waders. It looks splendid and wasn't entirely unsuccessful, unlike our visit there at the weekend, when we only ticked  urlLink Blue Tit . Yesterday, there was a smashing summer-plumaged male  urlLink Bar-tailed Godwit  (a scarce passage migrant in this area, though there's been an influx over recent weeks), two  urlLink Dunlin , a  urlLink Greenshank , lots of  urlLink Redshank  (as usual) and a herd of inquisitive bullocks.

      I'd completely forgotten there was a Grand Prix on yesterday! However, I can see I barely missed anything.   My interest has waned somewhat since I first became interested about ten years ago (early 1994, pre Imola). Then, I was an anally-retentive F1 know-it-all... I knew all the drivers' names, some of their birthdays (!), which team they drove for, what number their car was, what their helmet design was, I could name all Larrousse's pay drivers for the season (hello, Philippe Adams, the really rubbish Belgian),  and  the names of their children. How things change. Christ, that year they had  urlLink Pacific ,  urlLink Simtek  and  urlLink Lotus  on the grid! Now I can barely remember all the teams...  There are some right old shenanigans going on on  urlLink Peterbirder  at the moment, but since it's bird race-related, I'll write about it another time.

      Since it was a showery day, I decided to go to  urlLink Orton Brick Pit  to try for  urlLink Arctic / urlLink Black Terns . Of course, there were none (not even any  urlLink Common Terns ). The best and most fascinating bird there by far was a  urlLink Nightingale .   The strange thing about it was the noise it was making. At first, there seemed to be a  urlLink Chaffinch  calling (the  urlLink Greenfinchy , wheezy kind of call) and something that sounded like a frog going  'frrrrrrrrrrp!' , coming from the same area of vegetation. Then, the  urlLink Nightingale  revealed itself for a few seconds, and it was clearly producing both the sounds, almost simultaneously! Very odd indeed.      We waited in vain for a rain shower to bring down some migrants, but, of course, this failed to materialise. So the next stop was  urlLink Ferry Meadows , where Mike Weedon had reported a first-summer  urlLink Little Gull . That was still there, and there were  urlLink plenty of Common Terns  around, a passage of  urlLink House Martins ,  urlLink Swallows  and  urlLink Swifts , and the usual evening  urlLink Starling  flights from north to south (birds which had been feeding on the Milton estate returning to their nest sites in Orton, or vice-versa?). But no  urlLink Arctic  or marsh terns. And no rain.   Ended up at  urlLink Eldernell , where it also did not rain. Nice evening for it, though.

      Well, it looks like the unscheduled trip to  urlLink Woodwalton  could have cost me a PBC tick -  urlLink Black Tern ! Two were seen at  urlLink Eldernell  today. Yes, I still  neeeeeeeeed   urlLink Black Tern  though I ticked White-winged Black at  urlLink Welland Bank Pits  last summer!  Oh well. You can't be everywhere at once and some things need to be checked out...  The spectacular creature below is a hunting (as opposed to web-spinning) spider called  Pisaura mirabilis , which I watched confront another smaller, darker spider. Dark Spider approached, waving its forelegs and antennae things (sorry, I'm not an arachnologist). Big Spider tolerated it for a while, before threatening to grab it and sending it scuttling for safety. I'm getting to enjoy watching minibeasts close-up.

         Spent a large part of yesterday afternoon/early evening on the washes. Spring wader passage seems to be at its peak so far, which is good 'cause we didn't really have any at all last year!  urlLink Bar-tailed Godwit ,  urlLink Grey Plover ,  urlLink Sanderling ,  urlLink Little Ringed Plover  and  urlLink Greenshank  have all been seen in the past week - not bad for an inland area.  We were just about to go home when  urlLink Steve  called " urlLink Temminck's Stint  - flying along the bank, past the  urlLink Shelduck , past the  urlLink Mute Swans , over the drove - now!" He ID'd it on tail pattern - all white with a black central stripe. Pretty impressive.   Unfortunately, it's such a big area that it was nigh-on impossible to get onto a titchy wader flying hell-for-leather. I saw it as it flew over the drove, but didn't get anything on it at all - bugger!  Had a phone call this morning about "four or five  urlLink Wood Warblers  singing at  urlLink Woodwalton Fen ". In the  urlLink PBC  area, that's definitely worth checking out, since the species is only a rare migrant, and I  neeeeeeeeeeeeeed  it.  Sadly, by the time a small group of us had arrived, there was no sign of them. Actually, "four or five" in a small area does sound a little odd, since it's practically a vagrant to this area and they were "doing that trilling call" - I thought  urlLink Wood Warbler's  call was a bit like  urlLink Bullfinch ? Anyway, it's not the end of the world... There was the usual array of warblers, including  urlLink Grasshopper  and  urlLink Garden Warblers . So not entirely wasted.

      Another trip to  urlLink Ferry Meadows . Not a lot about, though I heard (and saw) my first  urlLink Garden Warblers  of the year, which is always nice. For me, their song compares favourably with  urlLink Nightingale , and they're  not  featureless and boring...   I was really hoping for a Red-rumped Swallow (they seem to be everywhere else, so why not Peterborough?), but drew a blank, though there were loads of  urlLink House Martins  zipping about. Don Gardener and Matt Webb saw six  urlLink Arctic Terns  but I didn't.     What's in my CD player:  Feast Of Wire  -  urlLink Calexico

      Pics from this morning's  urlLink CES  ringing session at Ferry Meadows.    Juvenile  urlLink Great Spotted Woodpecker        Juvenile  urlLink Kingfisher     Female  urlLink Reed Bunting  'control' - originally ringed by someone else at another site - details to come.  Somewhere around 120 birds were trapped this morning - Chris's 100th CES visit to FM - from about 4am to 12.30pm when we packed up. We had the first juvenile  urlLink Reed ,  urlLink Sedge  and  urlLink Garden Warblers  of the year, plus what seemed like the entire juv  urlLink Great Tit  population of Cambridgeshire.  The weather conditions were good to start with, since it was overcast and not too breezy. Unfortunately, the vegetation was dripping with rain from the previous day, and it got hotter and more windy as the morning went on. There was a lot of deep, squelchy mud underfoot - as usual - and the mosquitoes took a toll on us - as usual. No amount of insect repellent seems to make a difference.  I felt like I made huge progress today. Extracting birds from nets is really tricky and it requires patience, a bit of problem solving, dexterity and a cool head! Today I finally felt like I was getting there. I'm still very slow (Chris can do about ten birds in the time it takes me to do one), but now I feel like I've got the basic hang of it and from now on I'll be able to get faster. Something clicked today. Hurrah!     What's on my iTunes:  Gold  -  urlLink Ryan Adams

      With some time off work I decided it would be nice to go to  urlLink RSPB Titchwell  for some digiscoping. Everything's close there, isn't it? All the birds seem tame.    Highlight was this male  urlLink Ruff  which showed well close to the main path. That's a real ruffy Ruff. And if  that's  not a mullet, I don't know what is...    I made numerous attempts at photographing  urlLink Avocets  (which were plentiful), but in 90% of my shots, the birds had their heads underwater. Never mind.    A very showy  urlLink Sedge Warbler  perched by the entrance to one of the hides and sang right out in the open, until it was flushed. That's the only problem with Titchwell - it's very busy.    There wasn't a lot on the beach, except for a few  urlLink Oystercatchers .    A couple of summer-plumaged  urlLink Spotted Redshanks  looked smart but were a little distant for me.

         Gastrophysa viridula ?  Went on an insect-hunting expedition to  urlLink Houghton Mill , near Huntingdon. By the time we got there, it was very overcast and looked likely to rain, which I thought would work against us. But in fact the opposite was true.  Our chief quarry was  urlLink White-legged Damselfly ,  Platycnemis pennipes , an uncommon species not present in the PBC area. I know next to nothing about insects so it was a good job that  urlLink Steve  was there to tell me what was what.   Since I bought my second-hand Nikon Coolpix 995 last year, I've become much more interested in insects because the brilliant macro function enables me, an unskilled idiot, to take excellent photos (even if I do say so myself). So please excuse me if I go over the top with my pictures in this post, because I'm delighted with them!                   Female (top three) and male Banded Demoiselle,  Agrion splendens        Male White-legged Damselfly,  Platycnemis pennipes . The white legs are dangled in flight to attract females.       Freshly-emerged ('teneral') Scarce Chaser,  Libellula fulva        Male (top) and female Red-eyed Damselfly,  Erythromma najas     Blue-tailed Damselfly,  Ischnura elegans      What's in my CD player:  Grand Slang  -  urlLink City Slang  label compilation.

      Even I enjoyed last night's Holland v Czech Republic  urlLink Euro 2004  game. I was rooting for our Czech friends throughout, but it did seem a bit harsh on Holland that they eventually lost. However, there was a total absence of mullets on either side, though several of the Czechs wore their hair in the 'lank, greasy-looking with bit of elastic tied round it' style, and there was mullet potential on a few more.

      It appears I wasn't the only one to notice Fernando Torres' amazing mullet on Saturday.  "Torres has an unbelievable peroxide blonde mullet - sort of American truck driver meets Limahl, but he can certainly play. Within 10 seconds he swivels sharply before firing a volley that's blocked." -  urlLink The Guardian   Amongst the Spanish side, Fernando Morientes also has a tremendous mullet. Do they pay good money to have their hair cut like this?     Why does the mullet persist among football players?  urlLink Dan's Mullet Haven  may yield some clues.

      I was alerted to a van Nistelrooy goal for Holland against Germany (now 1:1) by triumphant hoots coming from somewhere down the street. I don't usually pay much attention to football but sometimes you get sucked in.   Euro Mullet Watch  I have been scouring the  urlLink Euro 2004 website  for more mullet action, but it's been sadly lacking so far. I haven't even spotted any mullets on TV this evening - oh, hang on - there's one - Bastian Schweinsteiger - see those tell-tale curls creeping down his neck?      The ref is sporting a terrific, shaggy coiffure, but I am undecided as whether van Nistelrooy's wig counts as a mullet or not. Somehow he manages to get away with it. I think for it to be a mullet, you need fairly short 'sides'.  There is something nice about the European nations getting together to play football in the Portuguese park; it makes a nice contrast from the 60-year-old images of D-Day the other week. However, some idiotic Engerland fans cannot resist the temptation to smash some things up, be it at  urlLink home  or  urlLink away ...

      After all the fuss on the  urlLink news  about  urlLink iTunes , I decided to take the plunge this evening. It took a while to download (being about 19Mb), but was worth the wait...   It looks lovely, as might be expected, and it's dead easy to use. To give it a whirl, I plumped for  Hey Ya!  by  urlLink Outkast  - great song and a snip at 79p. I've realised that I don't listen to anywhere near enough new music these days, so maybe this is the way forward...  I've also just realised that you can listen to 30 second previews of the songs  before  you download them. Very useful...   Bad:  they don't have any  urlLink Radiohead  or  urlLink Lambchop  in stock at present, and you can only get IRS-era  urlLink R.E.M.

         This evening I helped on an  urlLink RSPB  guided walk at Eldernell. It was good fun. There were 24 people keen to find out more about the birds and environment of the washes and I think they went home happy. Bob and Emily, who showed me the  urlLink Slow-worm at Bedford Purlieus , were there.  We had good views of  urlLink Barn Owl ,  urlLink Grey Heron ,  urlLink Swift ,  urlLink Swallow ,  urlLink Cormorant  and  urlLink Meadow Pipit  and more distant views of  urlLink Long-eared Owl  and  urlLink Marsh Harrier . We watched a  urlLink Hobby  hawking for dragonflies over the pit, which was nice. All these are taken for granted by most birdwatchers but it's great to look at them in a different, fresh way...

      The  urlLink Nightjar  is one of Britain’s most intriguing birds. They have an air of exclusivity – you aren’t going to see them unless you go to special sites in peculiar habitats at certain times of year; they aren’t birds you can just bump into.  It was for these reasons that I hadn’t seen one until last year, at the advanced age of 23 – I simply hadn’t been anywhere where there were any. When I was younger, I listened to tape recordings of ‘churring’ and thought what a bizarre, un-bird-like sound it was; they remained one of those mythical birds which were really interesting but that I might never see.  So last year’s experience was pretty amazing. But nobody told me they were going to fly around my head at barely an arm’s distance!  A year on, it was time for a return visit with  urlLink Steve Dudley , former Brecks resident and repository of local knowledge. The Brecks, on the Norfolk/Suffolk border, have some of the country’s largest  urlLink Nightjar  populations in the heathland/open pine forest. On the way, we stopped at  urlLink Cavenham Heath  and saw a family party of  urlLink Wood Larks , a hunting  urlLink Hobby , a pair of  urlLink Little Owls  and a Red Fox trotting around, watched by Rabbits.  Onto the main event. As we walked along the forestry track to the  urlLink Nightjars'  arena, numerous 'roding'  urlLink Woodcock  flew over (click  urlLink here  to hear what that sounds like). At about 21:30, we heard the first  urlLink 'jar  of the evening... a hollow, distant, whirring, rattling, rasping buzz, dipping and rising in pitch every few seconds...   Perhaps I don't have to labour too hard to describe it to you, because you can listen to an  urlLink MP3  here!  Soon, we saw a bird floating against a backdrop of cloudy sky and dark pines... a male, with white wing flashes. Walking further along the track, a young Brown Hare lolloped along towards us next to a timber stack. We heard more churring, saw males flying around and into the forest, before another, much closer bird started up. It's only when you get really close to a  urlLink Nightjar  that you get the full impact of just how... strange the sound is. It doesn't sound like a bird at all, more like something mechanical.  Most of the churrers... churr for a minute or so, then just stop dead. It's when there's a female in the vicinity that things get really exciting. It's all about sex, of course. The churring goes on for a while as normal, before breaking down, coming to a clattering, squawking halt, with exuberant wing-clapping (and probable mating). That's pretty special to hear.   One of the ways to attract a male  urlLink Nightjar's  attention is to mimic his wing-clapping. We tried it, with immediate results... we watched as the male flew towards us, silhouetted against the darkening sky, calling, and flew in a small circle around our heads, having a good look before vanishing back the way he'd come.   The late birder gets the worms, too...     What's in my CD player:  Noyoucmon  -  urlLink Lambchop

      Got bored doing some work while it's too warm to get to sleep and somehow I ended up listening to  urlLink Mark Radcliffe's  new show on  urlLink BBC Radio 2 . I used to fall asleep listening to Mark and Lard when they did the Graveyard Shift (22:00-00:00) on Radio 1 in the mid 1990s.   Ah, happy days... They used to do what could loosely be described as 'comedy', in the form of Sh*t Agent, the Rabbi Lionel Blair, Fish or Fowl etc etc etc. In about 1997 they moved to the breakfast show because they got fed up of not being able to go out in the evenings, and the world of radio was all the poorer. I used to enjoy listening to poetry from the likes of  urlLink Simon Armitage  and  urlLink Ian McMillan , and the show provided me with a supply of musical inspiration. I'm pleased to say that this new show seems to be taking some of the old one's elements, which can only be a good thing.  I've never listened to  urlLink Radio 2  before...

      Word broke this morning that a  urlLink Black Tern  was at  urlLink Welland Bank Pits ! Couldn't resist the lure of another  urlLink PBC tick , so I headed up there and there it was, number 191 on my list. After last weekend's  urlLink disaster , it was a relief!   I enjoyed watching it hawk for insects for about an hour... it spent quite a lot of time flying high over the water, presumably where its prey was. The size and flight differences with  urlLink Common Tern  were interesting. I've seen a few  urlLink Black Terns  in Northants before but these were my best, most prolonged views.  A  urlLink Hobby  dashed around, grabbing insects and having a pop at young  urlLink Starlings .     What's in my CD player:  Mighty Joe Moon  -  urlLink Grant Lee Buffalo

      Despite the sunshine, today's  urlLink CES (Constant Effort Site)  visit to  urlLink Ferry Meadows  was much more productive than the previous two. A whopping total of 107 birds were processed between 05:00 and 12:30, with the two most numerous species being  urlLink Blackbird  and  urlLink Blue Tit . Usually,  urlLink Reed  and  urlLink Sedge Warblers  are the most commonly trapped birds at FM, but  urlLink Blackbirds  and  urlLink Blue Tits  have probably just fledged their first broods whereas the warblers are still sitting on theirs.  Highlight were probably a smart juvenile  urlLink Reed Bunting  and a juvenile  urlLink Mistle Thrush , which was a site ringing 'tick' for Chris. Though willow carr and alder/birch woodland isn't really typical habitat for  urlLink Mistle Thrushes , the bird had probably been feeding on the nearby golf course with its family, and happened to drop into a net! A very striking bird indeed.         I continue to make slow (but steady) progress with ringing. I'm still getting the hang of extracting birds, which I don't find easy at the moment. Some extractions are fairly straightforward, but others are extremely complex! With the addition of deep mud underfoot, the attentions of mosquitos and sweaty, humid conditions, it all adds up to bloody hard work, though ultimately satisfying...

      [Sorry for photo overkill]   urlLink WWF  is always worth a visit at any time of year. At this time, it's rather quiet on the bird front, but there are plenty of insects around - ideal for a bit of macro photography. Before I got anywhere, the sightings board at the entrance to the reserve made rather... interesting reading.     Like  urlLink Bedford Purlieus ,  urlLink Woodwalton  is another site where I'm never quite sure of where I am. Fortunately, the site is sort of rectangular shaped, with rides mostly running through it going east-west or north-south, which is helpful. Since it was such a hot, sunny day, there were lots and lots of insects around. Here are a few photos of the ones that didn't elude me.  I found a clump of decomposing, big daisy things (botany is not my strong point). I don't know if they were wild or not, but Speckled Wood butterflies were going mad for them.        This fly-looking thing was interesting...    As usual, I don't know what this moth is, either...    Darters were everywhere, but I had a long wait until I found some that sat still for long enough for me to get a photo. I suppose I need to improve my fieldcraft, or find something not as skittish...      Ruddy Darter    Common Darter  On my meandering way back to the car, I walked past a big bank of thistles, which was absolutely heaving with butterflies and other insects. Here are the highlights:          I didn't recognise Wall at the time, but of course the wonders of digital photography meant that I could show them to  urlLink Brian  later on for instant IDing.

I've heard  urlLink Greenfinch  but  urlLink Robins  are still conspicuous by their absence. I suppose it's that time of year.  The privet bush in the garden is absolutely covered in hoverflies.

         Time off work permitted me to join my trainer Chris Hughes for some weekday ringing at  urlLink Ferry Meadows  this morning. Even at 4.30am, it was clear it was going to be a hot and sticky day, and so it proved...  A successful visit with 137 birds trapped. I set a new personal 'best' with 37 birds extracted, of various shapes and sizes, including:  urlLink Whitethroat ,  urlLink Bullfinch ,  urlLink Treecreeper ,  urlLink Long-tailed Tit ,  urlLink Garden Warbler ,  urlLink Blue  and  urlLink Great Tits  and  urlLink Wren . I am still embarrassingly slow and I insist on making things more complicated than necessary (according to Chris), but progress is being made, which is the important thing. I ringed 18 birds today (probably would have done more if things hadn't been so busy), including the  urlLink Great Spotted Woodpecker .     urlLink Treecreeper      urlLink Reed Warbler   We took quite a few photos in preparation for a feature I'm writing; however, I won't display them all here - I look like I've been dragged through a hedge backwards. But, for the first time, here is the  urlLink Ferry Meadows  ringing site in all its luxuriant glory.     I probably should have taken a photo of the mud, which, at its worst is like walking through treacle. The key is to keep moving or you'll get stuck and be sucked down into the depths.  Chris picked up this, which we guessed was a Water Shrew. I don't know what to make of its smart white snout-stripe, though - is it just an aberrant individual, or something more unusual? Water Shrews are meant to have silvery hairs underneath their tail and on their feet, which I didn't notice. Comments, please!           By the time we finished (earlier than usual) at 12.30pm, I had a raging headache (despite drinking two litres of water), but it was fun!

      Have been a bit busy recently with moving house, so birding, blogging and photographic activities have been curtailed. However, when I've had the chance, I've been building up my new garden list.  The definite star birds so far have been two  urlLink Hobbies  which have passed over. I'd probably have missed them entirely were it not for the  urlLink House Martins  that are breeding in the neighbourhood. When they're up in the air over the houses (which is most of the time), they have to be constantly vigilant for predators. So when they spot a  urlLink Hobby , they go beserk and start alarm-calling. That's my cue to go outside (or stick my head out of the nearest window) and scan the skies.   The other day, a  urlLink Sparrowhawk  went over. It was quite interesting how they recognised it as posing a lesser risk than a  urlLink Hobby . Though they gave the hawk a wide berth and made sure everyone knew it was there, they were far less concerned about that than the falcon. That fascinates me. Obviously, they are far more skilled at raptor recognition than most birdwatchers.  Sometimes I hear the alarm calls (a high-pitched 'ziiu, ziiu') from some birds, while others continue feeding. Maybe these are young birds getting over-excited or it could be a learning process.  The martins are still showing a bit of interest in nests, including an artificial cup fixed under my neighbour's eaves. I think I'll get one of those. There's also a barely-started nest on the end of the same house which receives attention every now and then. Perhaps they're thinking ahead for next year? I'd imagine that  urlLink House Martins  must have problems finding mud in urban situations like these. There aren't rutted cart-tracks or ponds to gather nest material from, so there must be a fair bit of travel involved in building their own from scratch. How many beakfuls of mud does it take to build a nest? Where are they getting it from?  What's also interesting is that they aren't always around. Sometimes the air is full of their calls, and other times they're nowhere to be seen. Where do they go? My guess is that they're hawking for insects over lakes and the river, or just out of sight high up. After all, they have to follow their food supply. The same goes for the  urlLink Swifts  which are usually - but not always - visible nearby.    urlLink House Sparrows  are numerous in gardens here, but I have yet to tempt one onto the feeder hanging from the washing line post. They do forage on the [very scruffy] lawn, but I don't know whether it's for seeds or insects (there are a lot of flying ants about currently).   The crowning glories of the garden are the non-cherry-producing cherry sp. tree in the front, and a big Ash tree in the back. The Ash is the biggest tree in the street so I'm hoping it will 'grab' birds flying over. I'm annoyed the cherry won't produce any fruit (don't ask me why not) but its dense tangle of branches and twigs seems to be popular (for perching purposes) with  urlLink House Sparrows ,  urlLink Starlings ,  urlLink Blackbirds  and  urlLink Goldfinches .  A  urlLink Common Tern  flew over carrying a fish on the first day so I'm obviously under a flightpath between breeding and feeding sites.  urlLink Canada Geese  have flown past every day so far and there's a constant stream of  urlLink Black-headed Gulls  going over.   On the other hand, I've had to work hard to see a  urlLink Chaffinch  and  urlLink Dunnock  from the house and there's still no sign of  urlLink Song Thrush ,  urlLink Greenfinch ,  urlLink Robin  or  urlLink Great Tit ! But things seem promising, so far...     What's in my CD player:  I Hope You're Sitting Down  -  urlLink Lambchop

      Another generous lift from Brian  urlLink 'Natural'  Stone took me and  urlLink WWoN  to "local wader hotspot"  urlLink Maxey gravel pits . We started off on the Etton Road side of the pits (which looks very tasty indeed), but it was the usual  urlLink Green Sandpiper  and  urlLink Sand Martin  fare.  Booooooooring.      There were a few insects around, though, including a Clouded Yellow and an Essex Skipper which I managed to photograph (not very well).    This hoverfly (feeding on the dreaded Ragwort) made a nice picture.    And these Soldier Beetles were... doing what beetles do.    Having established that those pits were lacking in birds, we drove round to the Woodgate Lane section. Another  urlLink Green  and a  urlLink Common Sandpiper  were found, which is about all that can be expected there.  I turned to the hedgerow to look for insect macro 'prey'. There were stacks of Gatekeepers,  Pyronia tithonus , but only this one permitted a close approach - it sat still for ages.  urlLink Mike's  a bit gripped off* because he wants to be King of Insect Macro Photography, and he thinks these are better than  urlLink his ! Ha!  We're not competitive at all...       Having enjoyed a pleasant lunchtime in the sunshine (for once), we were thinking about leaving when I spotted a  urlLink Hobby  hawking for insects over the pits. It's always amazing to watch them pass prey (presumably dragonflies in this case) up to their bills.   Next, Brian was first to catch sight of a  urlLink Little Egret  which had flown in from the north. It went down on the edge of the pit and gradually flew closer and closer, but was never really digiscopable due to a) heat haze and b) tall vegetation.    urlLink Little Egrets  are everywhere at the moment. There were four at  urlLink Star Pit  yesterday and one at  urlLink Welland Bank  this morning. How many there really are in the area is anyone's guess. It's a post-breeding dispersal which seems to be very marked this year.   Place your bets on where  urlLink Little Egrets  will be first to breed in the PBC area...  * 'Gripped off' is silly twitchers' slang. It means you're jealous of what someone else has seen. You can also say 'I gripped Mr X off', meaning that you've seen something that you know he'll want to have seen.   I once encountered someone who pulled up in a car next to our birding group, leaned out of the window and shouted: "Spotted Eagle! Gripped you!" and drove off again.   It might have happened that way, or it might have been embellished slightly... You get the gist.      What's in my CD player:  Radiator  -  urlLink Super Furry Animals

      A few people have asked me how I started my blog. There are probably far easier ways to do some of the things below, so if you have a tip which might help other bloggers (or would-be bloggers), you could leave a comment.  I'm by no means a web expert, but here's how I've done it.    Get blogging  1. Go to  urlLink Blogger  and get yourself set up with a  blog account . You have to pick a username which will form your web address. So choose carefully. You can pick from a number of templates but this can easily be changed at a later date.  2. You need somewhere to  host your pictures . You might have some free webspace from your ISP so you could investigate that. If you haven't, go to  urlLink Lycos  and sign up for some webspace there. This is free and you get something like 50mb, which is plenty to be going on with.    Note:  I believe it's frowned upon to join just in order to get space in which to store pics, so you might consider designing a couple of pages just to make it look like you're trying...  Apparently, Blogger has now has a facility called  urlLink Hello  which you can use on a PC to upload pics to your blog, but I haven't tried it yet.  3. You may need a FTP program to  upload your pics  to the server. I think it's possible to do this in Internet Explorer on PCs, without any other software.  I bought  urlLink CoffeeCup FTP , which works very well (for PCs) and is easy to use. This works on Macs:  urlLink Transmit  You'll need to know the FTP address of your webspace's server. On Lycos, it'll be  ftp.lycos.co.uk   4. When you log in to  urlLink Blogger , you will be able to create a post in which to type text and  display photos . Depending on the template you use, you may not be able to use the pic any wider than about 400-450 pixels, or it makes the page look funny. But you can always use the ones in your blog as thumbnails and link to a bigger version.  5. Create a post.  Learn a bit of basic HTML  to show images. Blogger's Help file is really useful and contains a post on this:  urlLink click here .   Important note:  Make sure you get the address and the file extension right (ie. JPG, jpeg etc) or it won't work. Use the 'Preview' function to test before you publish.  Here is Blogger's advice on posting pictures:  urlLink How do I post pictures?   6. Submit your website to  urlLink Google   7. If you want to know how many  visitors  your blog is getting (or not getting, as the case may be), get a counter.  urlLink Nedstat  do a good one. Sign up and they'll give you some code to insert in your blog's template.  8. If you want to add  links  to your blog's sidebar, click here to find out how:  urlLink How do I edit my link list?   9. A  search  facility for visitors to your blog is very useful.  urlLink Freefind  is good.  10. If you're dead clever, I'm told you can  edit your blog template  to suit your needs. But  urlLink don't ask me how to do that...

      Disaster had apparently struck when I read this e-mail on  urlLink Peterbirder :   From: John Oates 10:04am  Marcus Kohler has just phoned to say Kevin Webb has found an adult male  Red-footed Falcon  at Dogsthorpe Star Pit at 7.30am today. It was with a Hobby.   John   Aaaarrrghhh! On the busiest day for ages, too... Would we get a chance to look for it? Not until lunchtime, and it was a bit late by then. Again,  urlLink Brian Stone  gave  urlLink WeedWorld  and me a lift to Star Pit on the remote chance of the Red-foot still hanging around.  Of course, it wasn't there, but the Little Egret was, and there were plenty of gulls to look at - if you like that sort of thing... We didn't even neeeeed the falcon for our  urlLink PBC lists  (click  urlLink here  for Phil Ackerman's excellent pics of last year's long-staying Deeping Fen bird).  Mike found a Small Copper, but during his enthusiastic attempts to take its picture, it flew off...   I urgently  neeeeeed  to take some photos before my blog gets superseded by the two mentioned above.  So, for now, here's that damselfly pic again.

      Another  urlLink CES  ringing session at  urlLink Ferry Meadows . Didn't take any photos this time - too busy! About 115 birds were trapped today - about 25 of those were retraps. I extracted about 20 birds again - the number only limited by my slowness...! But there's no point rushing - just keep going, learn the ropes: practice makes perfect.  It was looking like being a slow morning to start with; it was very overcast and the sun never came out. But the catch was boosted by 30 birds all flying into one net - mainly juvenile  urlLink Great  and  urlLink Blue Tits , with the odd  urlLink Sedge Warbler  thrown in. Ringers love  urlLink Blue  and  urlLink Great Tits ... they take every opportunity to peck and nip you, which I suppose is only fair. It can virtually be guaranteed that we won't retrap any of them, but unless you try...  Apart from the juvenile  urlLink Reed Buntings  (scarce on the site, as far as ringing's concerned), the best bird was an adult male  urlLink Sedge Warbler . Not very exciting, you might think, but this individual has been trapped at  urlLink FM  every year since  1997 ! It's an amazing feat of site fidelity, and just think how many hundreds of miles those wings have done...   urlLink Chiffchaffs  and  urlLink Willow Warblers  were notable by their relative absence, the same as last time. There were a few unringed adult  urlLink Reed Warblers  on the site - perhaps birds whose breeding attempt has failed during the past week's bad weather.  Incidentally, conditions underfoot were tough - about a foot of water in places, on top of the usual squelchy mud. I slipped over on my arse once, though the only thing hurt was my backside. Again, the growth of willow and other vegetation over the past two weeks was immense. Good job it was only about 18° C. The mosquitos weren't as active as usual, which was a blessing.

      Went for a stroll at lunchtime to  urlLink Grimeshaw Wood  with  urlLink Weedon's World of Nature . Upon entering the wood, we spotted some Hornets buzzing around and soon discovered they were going in and out of a fallen, hollow tree stump. Mike was keen for some photos so we were brave and tried to macro them... Bit scary.       This is some kind of cricket, just next to the hornets' nest.    Pollen beetles on a thistle flower.

       urlLink  Bird worry after cockler invasion : "Groups of up to 90 cocklers have been working at Lafan Sands in north west Wales for the past 10 days.

But conservationists are worried that sea birds' feeding grounds are being disturbed."   urlLink Old birds' network  "ONE of Britain's oldest birds has been found safe and well off the North Wales coast.

      As I've said before, it is sometimes nice to go and see an interesting bird, even if it is Out Of Area. So this afternoon I drove up to Norfolk with  urlLink Mike  to Snettisham to see a moulting summer-plumaged  Greater Sand Plover . ("I'm thinking of going for this sand plover, and  you're  going to drive!" - this is fair enough, since MJW has given me plenty of lifts in the past).   Presumably this is the sand plover sp. which was seen flying south at Spurn, East Yorkshire, yesterday.  Things didn't look very promising to start with, since a) it was bucketing down with rain on the way there, and b) when we got to the  urlLink RSPB  car-park, there were about four cars in it - where was everyone??!   Me: There aren't many people here, are there? MJW: No.  After some staring out at the Wash for a while (tide miles away), and a text from Mark 'Wardy' Ward, we decided to go down to the 'beach car-park' (with Sophie from  urlLink Holme Observatory ), where we found a fair-sized crowd and the Greater Sand Plover. YOU BEAUTY!  The light was pretty bad and the bird a bit distant for digiscoping, especially on my magnification. It's sometimes hard to stop digiscoping and remind yourself you're there to enjoy the sight of a rare and beautiful bird. When you have the kit, it seems churlish not to try for some photos, but when they're this bad...  This is my 'best' record shot:   Greater Sand Plover,  Charadrius leschenaultii   There are much better pics on  urlLink Surfbirds  at the moment (and better to come, I'm sure). There were plenty of birding luminaries and acquaintances there -  urlLink Nigel Blake , Graham Catley,  urlLink Paul Hackett ,  urlLink Lee Evans ...   On the way back to the car, we said hello to Trevor, Jane and Dan Williams,  urlLink Will Bowell  and Bob Titman from  urlLink PBC . It was just starting to rain again, but by the time we hit King's Lynn, it was sunny...   Euro 2004 conclusion  There weren't nearly enough decent mullets to be seen, especially after the groups, but Greece have just won the tournament, 1-0 against the hosts, Portugal!   Cristiano Ronaldo is sobbing into his shirt.  I think I  may  have just won the sweepstake at work (guess how many goals would be scored, including penalties). Considering how little I know about football, this would be some feat indeed. I will wait and see tomorrow. Not holding my breath.  On a slight downer, my telly's just blown up...

      Got a lift out at lunchtime with Brian  urlLink 'Natural Stone'  Stone and Mike  urlLink 'Weedon's World of Nature'  Weedon to one of my favourite spots,  urlLink Bedford Purlieus NNR . Finally, other people are seeing the light and what a fantastic place it is!  We were on the lookout for White-letter Hairstreak and White Admiral butterflies. We failed on the first count, but scored on the second, thanks to an excellent piece of spotting by  urlLink Brian . The beautiful beast was up in a tree and was unphotographable, unfortunately. Still, it was a lifer for two of us and a ‘PBC tick’ for the other.    Speckled Woods were plentiful, though, and easily photographed.    This is a Soldier Beetle,  Rhagonycha fulva , I think.

      Visit these blogs:  ::  urlLink Toadsnatcher  ::  urlLink Weedon’s World of Nature  ::  urlLink The Natural Stone  ::  urlLink Bogbumper   I seem to have accidentally started a trend among a few local digiscopers. Now,  urlLink Steve ,  urlLink Mike  and  urlLink Brian  all have blogs and are using them to display their digital photos. What have I done?  Seriously,  urlLink Blogger  is a really simple way to show off your pics, as long as you have somewhere to host them. But it looks like  urlLink Blogger  has thought of that, too, because for PC-users, there’s a program specially for it (don’t ask me how it works). I’m not exactly a HTML expert but even I can manage to get my photos to do what I want them to, and it’s much, much easier than trying to maintain a normal website.  If you're typing in Brian's web address, thenaturalstone.blogspot.com, be careful you don't accidentally end up at  urlLink Natural Stone , which is all about "IRANIAN NATURAL STONTS" [sic].

      Went to look for  urlLink Wood Sandpiper  at  urlLink Welland Bank Pits  with  urlLink Weedon's World of Nature  after work. I went to pick up Mike from home and he gave me a guided tour of his rather lovely garden. It was  at this point that he temporarily lost the power of speech at the sight of a Small Copper butterfly - a garden tick.         Our searching at  urlLink WBP  was to no avail, however. Oh well. Perhaps we'll have better luck next time. Our route to and from The North took us past  urlLink Dogsthorpe Star Pit , though we didn't stop either time as we were running quite late and Mike wanted to get home to see   urlLink Big Brother   (sorry mate - your secret's out now).   'Twas only when I got home and read my e-mails that I discovered that a  urlLink Little Stint  had been seen at  urlLink Star Pit  in the early morning! It's a shame news didn't get out a little faster; we could have got out at lunchtime to look for it. These things happen.   To disseminate news effectively in this area, all it takes is a text message or phone call to someone and it'll get on  urlLink Peterbirder  virtually immediately.  When you find a good bird and enjoy watching it, remember someone else might enjoy it, too!  It seems I've already got  urlLink Little Stint  on my  urlLink PBC life lis t, though I have absolutely no recollection of it.

      A disastrous wrong turn on the way to  urlLink Morborne Hill  nearly ruined our lunchtime, but the obliging insects we found when we [eventually] got there made up for it.    Meadow Browns were everywhere, predictably.    Thistles and teasels are currently the nectaring plants of choice.    Naturally, I am unable to identify this moth.    I got my first pics of Small Skipper, a tiny butterfly.      urlLink Morborne Hill  has something of a reputation locally for being a red-hot raptor watchpoint; various interesting passerines have also occurred (eg. Serin, Firecrest, Waxwing, Red-backed Shrike). I've never seen anything of note there, but I always feel I might bump into something good. "Time in, birds out", says Ian Wallace.

       urlLink Great bustard jets into Britain    The extinct great bustard is back in Britain after 30 chicks arrived from the Russian steppes on Monday.   The great bustard is the world's heaviest flying bird and can weigh up to 20kg and stand to the height of an adult roe deer. Unfortunately it was regarded as a great delicacy in Britain and the last one was shot and eaten in 1832.  The chicks will now spend a period in quarantine and then will be prepared for release on Salisbury Plain. Plans to hatch chicks in Russia and bring them to Wiltshire were expected to come to fruition earlier this year, but the completion of the project was delayed by paperwork on the Russian side. - BBC News  See also:  urlLink Russian paperwork foils bird plan   urlLink Heaviest bird returns to Britain   urlLink Great bustard set for UK return      What's in my CD player:  Up  -  urlLink R.E.M.

            A few months back I bought some sketchbooks (at a bargain price, of course). This evening, I decided to use them. I will miss the local  urlLink House Martins  when they fly off for the winter.  This is to remind me that I was bad at sketching long before I was bad at digiscoping.  Before you all complain,  yes , I know that  urlLink House Martins  have  white  throats; I chose to scribble them a different way, alright? I do realise that this makes my doodles look something like a misshapen cross between an Alpine Swift (though they don't have dark throats, either) and  urlLink Little Auk .   I was just trying to capture some shapes, y'know? It's hard to get their flickering flight down on paper.     What's in my CD player:  Radiator  -  urlLink Super Furry Animals
