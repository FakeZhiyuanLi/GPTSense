             During this era in time there is a comparision on the pop-culture from 1900's to 1920's.  The people of the earlier days enjoyed going to see silent films. the woman of this time decide to smoke and raise their hems on the dresses, and much to the prudent oler womens opinion began wearing makeup and looking more like the actress at the movies.  There was prohibition so no beer, or wiskey was allowed for public sale, yet there was  places called: "speak easy" and the men would go out and drink, and be with other women, and do drugs too. I always think of this when Watson has looked for the charactor  Sherelock Holmes  in one of these places called a den.These people do not know anything about Jazz, not until a radio station based out of Pittsberg KDKA.introduced  a few good men who can really dig the wild beat,  Dizzy Gillasppe, and Paul Whitman, and Billy Holiday who  was a marvalious singer and   BBKing   and Winton Marsalis  gifted musicians to play songs about their life of rags to riches  hopefully moving towards making a name for themselves. They were men who could blow a horn or, play a guitar and ,  the voices were also an instrument of beauty.  These individuals were telling about folk stories and spirituals and  just raising a little hell. The Magazines and billboards replaced the old standards of being frugal, and savings. Now was the time to own what you get now simple new way of ownership is installment buying.  We had great writers   Ernest Hemingway, and Sinclare Lewis . The culture moved everyone into enjoying getting together with your neighbos and friends to listen to new music. Having fun and with no worries, of course their is always the games of monoply. The movie stars were very interesting to  everyone because we wanted to find people to look up to, and to encourage us.  We want interesting people to idolize or to make a hero out of that person putting more concern on their character than them just being "Joe shome ".  The Three Stooges and , The three little pigs ,Gone with the Wind

             I do not like war;  What is all this fighting for, I think you need to stand up and fight for justice. I wonder with the USA starting off with Lazi-fare, then choosing to go to war because we are beinging attacked, There are serveral men in my family that have gone into different wars,  and at that time I believed that it was the only way to protect our nation. since, the war with Iraq and Iran, and the middle East it's getting harder because these people are fighting back rougher than we have ever known in history. There have been women raped and killed , there has been mast killing, there has  been beheading, muckrakers who do not support the American way.  These people are allowed in to destroy buildings with people in them, and bomb and kill in the name  of God!  I am sorry are they ever lost , I know the Bible talks about war , here again it's hard to shallow the things said like destroy all inhabitants men, women, and children animals . I am not for war, but I believe there's  needs to be a way to straighten things out by talking and reasoning with those who disagree with us and our ways, and adopting some of there ways is not all bad, I guess we need to  compromise some how to make sense of all of the killings. I asked my Pastor one time when Mc vey had blown up the government building with the people and the children inside how do we live through this kind of hate, crime, and loss of life. He said Susan we are not prepared for this in our training as Christians and  we don't come to know how , but somehow God help us thru the pain and grief of this despair.

           This is one of those moments when I want to share about women.  I grew up thinking a woman belonged in the kitchen, or in the world of caring for her children, but my Mother is probably the first woman who inspired me after my teenage years. I was trying to run away from her because of her ability to be very critical. She was very good at being objective about many of our problems because as working in a college all day she didn't want to hear anymore problems. When she came home at the end of the day she wanted peace and quiet.  I was the type of daughter who loved playing in the mud, finding animals to bring home, and I loved being with my Father a lot because he peaked my interest .  I liked fixing things and figuring how they worked. So I tended to irritate my mom because I was more of atom- boy then a girl. She inspires me with her ability to keep a cool head in a crises. She is a great cook and seamtress, the best! Her mother taught her many things to do when you needed to make money: sell things door to door and  raise animals for sale,working hard at all cost. So I love every thing she has taught me. There's still more so hopefully I will be able to share with you latter on.     I think a woman can be anything she chooses to be. I  think that the idea of a woman  being  a help-mate to my husband is a great job in itself . I do have other pursuits such as, ART and I love animals. I want to share with you about my  hero:  Her name is  Ariel Durant  is a writer who helped her husband with his writings and She became known for being outspoken on her ideas on women, especially women rights.  She was also known for her ability to be a  conversationalist. I think she and I have a few things in common.  She married when she was 14yrs old and her husband ,  Will was 28.Ralf and I are have the  same difference in   age  except we are ten years apart.  Ralf is 48 and I am 38. Ariel and Will join together to write and express ideas about History.My husband and I are very interested also in Art and History as it changes each moment. I would like to learn to write and be a more mature  writer so I can communicate as my Father told his stories . He was our Family Bard! I guess he turned this job  over to me when he passed a way.

           I think there should be Labor Unions in America today because the   public really seems to need someone to listen to them.  1. I think it would be fair for a union representing to care about discrimination problems, Learning disabled, someone who is not as fast as every one else, or maybe they  could only put letters in envelopes.  2. If you have been in prison, that person should not be barred from a job just because he had a problem.  3. Women have a hard time competing with men for a fair wage, and the sexual abuse is abhoriable, I do not like it when I am treat as a play thing instead of someone who could add a vital part to a team in business.  4. I would like to see everyone treated the same , but I realize that would require cooperation. I grew up in a time when the people of a different skin color was very mistreated even after the civil rights were fought and won!  I was aware of "PeterBilt", here in TN. My husband worked as a security guard, yet you could see the men struggle as the Plant shut it's doors on many men and women around Christmas time! Where's the Spirit of the Holiday? We were amazed that the men still came out when it was cold to fight for their rights, and my husband quit because he could not understand them paying a security guard wages for taking care of an empty warehouse.

       urlLink dancing kitty            The welfare of yesterday provided for just the basics:  The Social Security, and for the migrant workers Food Stamps,and Medicare Insurance for the elderly. These did not start until 1960.   Today there are several programs that are run to help the poor and those living in poverty. One such program is called Families First this program is created to help those who were at first mother's who had no support from a husband and this government agency would help with rent, childcare,and support to find a job.  If the young lady was still in school she would need to go to high school, or do the GED. Study program and make a plan for her life.      There is also Child Support paid by either parents.  This program actually will find deadbeat dad's and Mother's too.  They can send this person to jail and garnish their wages in Tennessee. When  my husband and I first moved here in 2002 in July .We went to the welfare office on Broadway to get aid all they could do was give us Food Stamps and Tenn-care to my youngest son Isaiah.  About Six months latter my husband was working a good job, but the Department of Human resources would not give my two other children ten-care we were told by the Millersville Principle to call on Jo Ann Graves and she was told immediately of our situation her secretary went right to work to get my children Walter and Emma on the ten-care program.  After I got it , I was afraid I would  lose it because there was a shut down because the government was redoing the whole program.and cutting certain people off who actually needed the The Health Care. The way Tennessee handles their program is very sloppy.  I came from the  state of Missouri that rewards you  for going to work; instead pentalizes you for trying to better yourself Tennessee they tell everyone who is not on Families First ;as if you are less, then they are eager to put you on the program. If you do not better yourself after 5 years they can kick you their program . I would like a program where they care about your individual needs such as a person who always had to have help to accomplish  all the assignments and help when things emontionally hit hard like losing a job, or your children have problems in school too. I want equality. There are solutions, I keep looking for them. I think that it is nice to have a net to fall back on when times are rough, and there is no entitlement it means you deserve it because you have invested in the government program by the taxes taken out of your paycheck, bunches of people whom, I have made friends with do not believe in supporting someone who will not work, or take care of their family.  I do not believe it is an entitlement, but rather a privilege to have a little government assistantance so I can find a place in this world and be very productive.  I think there might be a stigma because everyone assumes that if you are on welfare your white trash it really hurts my feelings because I am smart I just need few more opportunities because some day I'll be around not everyone else will be. Someone has to take responsibility in their life. I am just a late bloomer, I wish I knew when I was younger what I wanted to be and could have be working on it all a long, who knows maybe I did.
