      Hey guys.  Just wanted to let you know that we're working to schedule a meeting/conference call for some time on Tuesday, June 29 to talk with Dan Benjamin.  He is going to show us some of the detials of the content management system and walk us through a training session of how to use it.  The most likely time for this meeting is  10:00 AM , so please plan on this tentatively.  I'll let you know for sure once the time is confirmed.  We'll meet in our basement area and have a speakerphone and a projector so that we can all see the same screen.  See you all on Monday.

      It looks as though the content management system for Alma's new site has reached completion and is now ready to install on our new webserver, a dual 1.33GHz Apple XServe.  I talked to Dan Benjamin, of  urlLink Autmoatic Labs , this morning, and he informed me that they had completed this portion of the project.  We'll most likely attempt to get everything installed around the first of next week and then do some testing.  I'm suere there will be some necessary  tweaks  as we begin to test the system and see how it works for our needs.  Now we should really be able to start seeing the new site unfold.

      There's a  urlLink neat article  on the process of web design that may help us streamline the process when we redo the activelabs design of Alma's site later this summer ;) Feel free to check it out in your spare time.

       If you look at  urlLink test.php , you'll notice I did a test migration from InDesign to BBEdit.  This set of steps seems to be the best to ensure no problems moving back and forth:    Select all of the text you wish to copy from Larry's text version of the catalog.   Open  urlLink stationary.php . This will create a blank document with the structure you need.   Paste the code into the page and change the  body id .   Structure the text as follows:   h1  for the topmost line    h2  is slightly smaller and italicized.  It is not used much    h3  for the subheadings that break from paragraphs    h4  also for subheadings that break from paragraphs, only smaller    b  denotes a subhead that does not break from a paragraph. It has a negative margin in order to remove paragraph indentation.   Use  em ,  strong  and  cite  for all other inline styling.   Use  abbr  and  . These tags assist the disabled. The first appearance an abbreviation or acronym tag should also contain the  title  attribute explaining the full word (e.g.  &lt;acronym title=&quot;Alma College Otaku and Gamers&quot;&gt;ACOG&lt;/acronym&gt;  )   Images should have the  src ,  alt ,  height ,  width  attributes. Graphics that explain or represent something should also inlude  longdesc=&quot;longdescs.php#[filename]&quot;  attributes. The image should also be linked with a  title=&quot;Extended Description&quot; . Example:  &lt;a title=&quot;Image Description&quot; href=&quot;longdescs.php#Guide-to-Course-Listings&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;images/Guide-to-Course-Listings.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Guide to Course Listsings. Click for an extended description.&quot; longdesc=&quot;longdescs.php#Guide-to-Course-Listings&quot; width=&quot;641&quot; heigth=&quot;414&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    Tables should use columns, column groups, row groups, headers, captions and the  summary  and  scope  attributes where appropriate (ask if you don't know).  This may seem tedious, but once again we want Alma to be friendly to the disabled and comply with  US  Section 508 and  WCAG  1.0.     Make sure all inappropriate entities are removed.

      Hey guys:  Since it's easy to forget to check the blog from time to time, I've turned on the feature that sends out an e-mail to a specified e-mail address when there is a new post or a comment made.  For this, I created a mailing list on Alma's mail server.  The address is:   urlLink web.project@alma.edu   Anything sent to this address gets sent to all 5 of us.

       Matt and I discovered a potential for big problems with three of us working on the same set of files. Jaguar will let us all have open the same file at the same time, which gives us the potential to lose data.  I suggest we label the files on which we are working, in order to let each other know what we have open and who to address with questions.  If it comes down to calling, I guess I have dibs on green.   Another headache we will have to deal with is copying and pasting from InDesign. Even with the source file we get excess white space and non iso-8859-1 characters. We could do some find and replaces, but I'm still having problems saving my files.  Instead of hopping to UTF-8, would anyone like to volunteer to write a PHP script that will "wash" our InDesign text, outputting good characters and entities (such as &amp;mdash; for &mdash; and &amp;quot; for &quot;)?

       Bam-Bam is serving both the Catalog and PHPMyAdmin. I've set a placeholder PHP file that will list all the files in the directory to preview, access it at  urlLink http://bam-bam.local/~kevind/Alma%20Online%20Catalog/ .  Here you can view what we have and the emerging stylesheet.   I've also configured the stylesheet to be quite flexible.  It has classes which will allow us to set commonly-recuring style information without inline styles check out  urlLink catalog.css  for more information.  If any more styles would be helpful, let me know.

      OK, guys, here is our new tool to allow us to communicate about some of the details of our project.  It will hopefully serve as a record of some of the things that we've done and a place to ask questions.  So if you do something that other people should know about, like creating a new style in a shared stylesheet or writing a new PHP function that might be helpful for others, post a note on it here.  If we need to schedule a meeting, I'll put a reminder here.  If you've got a question, you can ask it here.  If you just find a really cool/funny/well designed website, you can post it here.  If you're lonely on a Friday night and need a place to talk...well, don't use this blog, that's kinda depressing.  But anyway, you get the picture.  Have fun.

      We need a mechanism that safeguards against uploading a new file of the same name as a previously entered one. Currently, if an image is uploaded to the CMS, it saves over a previous image of the same name, with no alerts or safeguards. As our repository grows, this is going to become increasingly more of a problem.

      It seems clicking "cancel" in the CMS simply loads the previous page, including any POSTDATA sent with it. This has caused problems for me, because when I upload an image, view a different one and then hit cancel, the image is uploaded a second time, creating multiple, duplicate entries in the CMS.

      I've made wee little (13x13) logos for use when linking to "help" or "info" content. The titles of the images in the CMS are "Question Mark" and "Info Logo."

      If you change the "name" of a page in the CMS (thus, the url), it doesn't update the subpages with the new url, so you end up with dead links in the bread crumb.

       I just finished the new templates and stylesheets for the site and am waiting on the approval from the committee to implement them.  View the site at  urlLink http://webdev.alma.edu/special/new_css . The changes include the following:     Simplification of code   The new, pared-down the XHTML structure of the sites, mostly eliminating all of the inline styles and many superfluous  div  tags. This should allow us to alter the current look and feel more easily whether the changes are large or small.   The previous images and ID references were simple and intuitive. When used as a template, however, this causes problems because an element with  id=&quot;main&quot;  is very likely to show up in forms or named anchors within the site. All IDs have been prefixed with &quot;template_&quot; in order to prevent pages from not validating. Similarly, background images have been renamed to their associated element (e.g. template_welcome.jpg) to prevent overlap with user images.   Accessibility Changes   The new stylesheets ensure that disabled and non-screen-based browsers will have access to our site. Where appropriate I have used background images instead of inline images.   The stylesheet has now been set to apply to all media, and calibrated to print only information pertinant to the paper-based medium.  Changes include:   Styling links to match with text   Not displaying site navigation (with the exception of a breadcrumb) on the page   A print-specific image, similar to a letterhead, which would appear at the top of every page instead of the web-colored logo   Disallowing page breaks between a header and paragraph or inside a quote for longer pages   Resetting widths and floats of the content area to expand to page width     All font-size values have been set to relative heights to allow us to include a large-font alternate stylesheet for visually impaired viewers.   Fixing bugs with non-compliant browsers   As the site was most likely designed on Macs and viewed only by Macs on campus, some layout bugs in IE/Win were left uncompensated for in the final version. More updates to come as I only have access to these browsers at home.   Meeting executive staff concerns   The words Alma College have increased in size in the logo.   Teal has faded away from the page.  Although I believe some teal is necessary to balance the maroon, especially since it appears within many of the bullets and links on the site.   Torn paper has gone away. Use of the seal is from the entry to the College. It was my artistic choice, and meets the &quot;distinctive to Alma&quot; requirement. I'm open to suggestions. I also think the gradient does a good job of breakup up the blocky nature of the site, although I'm also open to suggestions here.   The new (non-web-safe) cream is #FFFFF0, and slightly less yellow than #FFC.   General Updates   Parents has been added to to the constituent navigation.   The menu choices on the main page reflect the web committee decisions.

       I just created a blank template.  If you want  to include an external link on the sidebar, to, for instance, the MCS department homepage, simply use the blank template and the following PHP script:    &lt;?  header( &quot;Location: http://cronus.mcs.alma.edu/&quot; );  ?&gt;    Using this template, you can do any PHP processing necessary without leaving the CMS. If you want to have a page in the system without appearing on the sidebar, simply set the parent_id field to NULL in the webpage table in the almacms database.

      It would be nice if there was a way to "save as" (i.e., if someone is creating a number of pages for their department that are all supposed to look the same, I'm sure they would appreciate the ability to start from one of the pages they made previously when creating a new page).

       Most of you know how fanatical I am about styles and appearances, and I'm working right now on an improved, multi-media version of the site.  As we all work on Macs by day, I thought I should post this--it's an image of a second-level page in MSIE6/Win.  Check out the extra spaces in the navbar...     Here's another problem, it's with MISE5.5/Win.  Not that my prototype is any better...

       Guys, I'm still having trouble with PHP's  include()  and  require() . PHP just will not recognize the functions defined in the included files.  I triple checked all my code and even tried to use Larry's test.php, but something's still not working.  If someone could look at  urlLink /academics/english/courses  I'd appreciate it.  The code I'm trying to run eventually would read:    &lt;?php  include('http://webdev.alma.edu/repository/files/lib.php');  display_courses($dept='ENG');  ?&gt;    Right now, I'd be happy simply if  say()  would work for me.

         Will not allow two words (i.e. Physical Plant, Motor Pool) in breadcrumb.  Appears as Physical_plant &amp; Motor_pool.   Cannot use acronyms (i.e. UPS) in breadcrumb.  Appears as Ups.   Use of anchors is not available with relative URLs.  Works occasionally with absolute URLs.  When using anchors, the specfic text which is used as an anchor appears as a link with nothing attached to it.  (Style sheet problem.)

         When a page is saved, it doesn't always show up in the Webpages edit area, and one of mine actually got deleted somehow (I had to recreate it)   Preview button opens blank window   I can't make a webpage and it's subpages a subpage of another page (I can't move the pages around)   Calling a php function from an included file kills php (nothing more gets sent to browser, html or otherwise). See  urlLink PHP Include Test  for an example (view the source from the CMS)   Not sure if we like the fact that we can't change the order of subpages in the navigation    Can't make a link to an external page (e.g., the library catalog) show up in navbar   Password change in "My Account" doesn't work   I think the CMS welcome page should display the 16 or 20 most recent updates instead of only 6

      I spent today going over the dynamic pages, making minor tweaks and insuring that everything works as it should.  The site is winding down toward completion.  The only topic left for discussion is the Directories section.  What are we going to do about listings, which are already out-of-date?

       We have  finally  gotten our  WYSIWYG  editor. It works moderately well, creates acceptably clean  XHTML , and once we give it a few more tweaks, could make our future re-designs much more simple. I have just discovered how to implement a stylesheet within the editor window, and have made a pared-down version of ours specifically for the  WYSIWYG , so those who must use it will now get a (fairly) accurate example of what they will get as an end product. Serendipitously, this &quot;light&quot; stylesheet could be used on the site as a whole as an alternate to send to television and handheld media&mdash;little more than a selling point now, but who knows how these will be used in the coming years.   So far, so good. The end is nigh.

       My apologies for not getting this up earlier. I have completely revamped the stylesheet and templates for the new site. The template changes have removed ALL inline styles, proprietary coding and non-structural, non-semantic XHTML from the templates.   My goal with the stylesheets is to create a uniform, cross-browser look and feel identical to the look and feel approved by the committee. I have specified styles for every HTML tag (viewable at  urlLink http://webdev.alma.edu/academics  ) in order to allow us to decide how everything on our site appears, and not a web browser.. So far it is pretty close, my cursory observations seem to have even whipped IE 5.0/Win into shape. At the bottom of the aforementioned page are also the classes we have defined in order to make some layout easier. Styles can also be defined or redefined in the "Extra Header Content" section of the CMS now   We need to decide a uniform, site-wide style for floating boxes, side column etc. Right now, admissions does it one way, athletics another, and the campus tour a third. I'd like to specify this outright so as to maintain the institutionalized feel we had invisioned. There are a few questions we need to answer, and maybe they'd be better addressed by the committee:     Form inputs: is it worth giving them a light background color if it will not show up in IE?   Horizontal Rules: Right now, they have been reset to centered, 90% width and the rest default. This appears differently in all browsers. There is much we could do with them. For example, this is an  hr  tag: Isn't that pretty?   Legends and fieldsets: once again, we should control these as much as possible, put them within our color scheme and define how they behave.     These details may seem minute, but as van der Rohe said, "God is in the details." Consider this a Draft. I can update or modify the stylesheet if they cause problems in any browser, and please notify me if they do. In addition, I've put together a print stylesheet that strips navigation, hides links and displays a page-appropriate letterhead. The current design was arbitrary, and I look to others to tell me how this should appear.
