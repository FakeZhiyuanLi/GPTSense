       Do you ever wonder about words? You know...like strong words. Love, and Hate. I capitalize them because they mean so much to me. Some words are used to much...like those two...and some I think aren't used enough...like Death. I think people can be dead long before there heart stops beating, or their brain becomes disconnected..and yet you don't walk around calling people dead like you tell people you Hate them or Love them...when those two words are so much stronger. I think a lot of ppl use those words so much that they have no meaning...and I think I am one of them with the word Hate...not so much the word Love, because when I don't mean it I type Luv...or i use the heart emoticon on msn..or tell someone I heart them...Love is something you feel deeply...and You can't run around telling everyone you meet that you love them...when you can't love everyone. Not everyone can mean everything to you and that is what Love is.  You can't Love a food....you can't Love a smell....nor can you Love a place...unless they hold spirits....or remind you of someone you Loved or Love.  Love isn't perfect though...and you don't have to be perfect to be Loved, or to feel Love...you can't be scared of Love, and you can't be to ready for it either...You can't expect Love to come, lightly scented and opaque, ready for you to except it and notice it...It isn't something to use so carelessly because it is truely the most nuclear and amazing weapon...the most powerful substance and chemical...and still the gentlest, most careful breeze.  I have never felt Hate. I often wonder how many people can truly come out on the other side and say they have felt Hate.  I imagine it to be something that can really sweep you off your feet...and something that would kill you eventually....If you've ever recieved hate...how can you live with it, in true form?  I don't think one ever really could.  It must be something so obvious and powerful that you immediately recognize it and sense it from all 5 angles.  But I don't know, because I've never hated anyone, and I don't know, because no one has ever told me they hated me. That's not to say no one does, because unless they tell me, I'll never be able to say if I could feel it coming with the help of all 5 senses, or if it was overpowering and terrible...   And what about simple adjectives? Like awesome, which really has a more indept meaning than just the 8 laters that so frequently slip out of mouths like mine.  To be into awe is to be totally floored...to be so posessed by the action that you are literally without a word to speak. Without a sound to make, and without the ability to breathe. That is how intense the word awe was created to be. And if something is awesome, that is how it makes you feel. Nothing has ever really been awesome to me.  Nothing has floored me....knocked me senseless, or made me faint. I have felt genuine sadness...but have i ever felt terror? or real fear? I don't think I have....because they too must be such strong emotions that you don't know what hit you, but you suddenly can recognize it. You know just what caused it, you know that it was terror...you know that it was fear, you know it was sadness, you know it was Love, you know it was Hate, you know it was awe that dropped your jaw. And betrayal....Who has not felt betrayal? To what degree is something that you can surely question if you please, but who does it not reveal itself to?  You must be so sheltered...so inexplainably sheltered to not feel betrayal. And shallowness. A verb and an adjective...so common and rightfully frequently used. Some people actually my be somewhat sheltered. Some people are hollow and will not feel anything until one of the above mentioned emotions brutally crosses there path and slashes throught the shelter and cage they hold so dear.  The world is then open, and they cannot hold to there simple minded ways so easily.  Their door is open...and there own philosophy must be created. They're own trail must be taken, and they cannot expect it to be paved and smooth. Every road is gravel, and some rocks are pepples, and more often than not a boulder or even the ocasional tree trunk may block the path. Gather your stronger friends, surround yourself with those filled with helpful tactics and bravery. Life is going to be tough, and you have to be tougher. Problems are going to be strong, and you have to be stronger.
