      Some Underground Rainbow notes:  -I have been away a lot, but expect more actual posts soon.  -We are now using Haloscan comments which will allow anyone to comment.  It does mean, however, that all previous comments are gone.  Sorry.  -The link to Anj Colyn has been fixed, and two new blogs have been linked.  -A new poll has been added.  Results of the last poll:  C.S. Lewis claimed the most souls with 11 of the 19 votes J.K.

      In celebration of the oh-so-unAmerican holiday, I reflect on a couple of my favourite references to the dear departed Queen.  "Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner party, and that the guests had been Leighton, Millais, Swinbourne, Rosetti, Meredith, Fitzgerald, etc.  Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic?  Heavens, no!  The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that."                                                from  Howards End  by E. M. Forster  '"Nonsense!" said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox. "Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they know that the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach. It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh, their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street!"  "It is you who are unpoetical," replied the poet Syme. "If what you say of clerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry. The rare, strange thing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it. We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to Bagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does say Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I say!"  "Must you go?" inquired Gregory sarcastically.  "I tell you," went on Syme with passion, "that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and that man has won a battle against chaos. You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria. I say that one might do a thousand things instead, and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape. And when I hear the guard shout out the word 'Victoria,' it is not an unmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest. It is to me indeed 'Victoria'; it is the victory of Adam."'                -from  The Man Who Was Thursday  by G. K. Chesterton

      There is only one option for the homosexual who wishes to follow Christ:  Surrender.  And guess what?  It's the same for you!  Surrender is the hardest and most crucial thing in the Christian walk.  Truly, wholly, continually to surrender.  It's also the easiest (remember that complexity thing...see, simple).  We cannot deal with the things with which we must deal.  The homosexual cannot deal with his or her homosexuality.  That is why so many end up leaving the faith or compromising it.  If what we hear God saying is "This is bad - deal with it", then of course we are at a loss.  We can't.  In my journey out of homosexuality, I have had to surrender many things:  my sexual urges, my romantic feelings, my sense of inadequacy, past attractions or unhealthy relationships, my own drive to fix things, my feelings or beliefs about who am I.  On and on it goes.    And the frustrating part?  It's continual.  If I am stressed, for instance, an old feeling may surface.  "But wait," say I, "I've surrendered that to Christ, what's it doing here, I must not have really done it, I'm a sham, I'm a bad Christian, I'll never be used by God!"  But it's just one more thing to surrender:  our thoughts of how it should go.  Surrender is a continual process.  Every time you surrender something, it gets easier, but it's not guarranteed to be the last time.  You must surrender it every time it returns.  We can do nothing on our own.  We NEED God to take all of the seeming contradictory COMPLEXITY we experience and order and juggle and create with it.  He's good at that.  It's what He does.  What do you need to surrender?  Your striving?  Your insecurities?  Your old patterns?  Your worldly wisdom?  Your creativity?  Your job?  Your finances?  Your future?  Your past?    Come before our Friend.  Breathe in deeply and feel Him all around you, feel Him with His hand upon your head, in the small of your back.  See Him before you, hanging on His cross.  This is where it happens.  Hold out that handful of tangled, distinct emotions and fears.  Bring them to Him at the foot of the cross and tell Him that they are His and no longer yours.  Lift them up, and press them into the hole in His side.  He has taken them.  He has and is dying for your sins and burdens.  Press each one into His side and watch it disappear in the agony of the Passion.  "You are free, child.  Live through me.  Leave it to me."  And be ready to surrender each burden again in the knowledge that it has been already taken.

      Growing up as a homosexual Christian, there was one thing I could never deny:  My need.  I needed God.  I needed healing.  I needed a break.  I needed love.  I needed something!  I was intimately aware of my need.  I was powerless, broken, wrong, a million things but never self-sufficient.  And most of the time, that's all I knew.  Those who are broken in obvious and consuming ways (such as same-sex attraction) cannot help but feel their need.  In the climate of today's church, that can be felt or construed as weakness, godlessness, or being unclean.  Our churches can project a belief that we should be forever victorious. After all, "The Lord is my shepherd.  I shall not want."  But shall I need?  Why don't we look at some more of David's Psalms:  "But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying." (Psalm 70:5 KJV)  "For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me...I am poor and needy "  (Psalm 40:12,17)  "Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy." (Psalm 86:1)  "For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness." (Psalm 109:22-24)   Every one of us must turn and face the fact that we are in deep Need!  We are called to weep and lament over our sin.  We know that none is righteous.  Those of us who smell the tulips know that we are, in fact, Totally Depraved(TM).  We cannot expect God to heal us, refine us, or use us until we admit to Him our need.    I, as a homosexual teenager, had no more need than you do right now.  You are needy, broken, dropping flesh everywhere you turn.  Your eyes are wasted away within your head, and your bones are weak within you.  Fall down (it is all you can do) at the foot (feet) of the throne that is also a cross, and spit up your need.  He is waiting to take it.

      There are many things the church at large can learn from those dealing with homosexuality.  In this, the first of a proposed series on these lessons, I will talk a bit about complexity.  By simply interacting with the idea of (or person of) homosexuality, we are accepting the fact that our lives, selves, and sexualities are more complex than we have hereto thought.  To the Christian, this can be simply a question along the lines of "If homosexuality is wrong, why are there gay Christians?"  When studied in depth, the complexity becomes more evident.  The homosexual neurosis (the best term I've come across, though still not satisfactory) is almost invariably the symptom of a number of infant, childhood, and adult events.  The very fact that my life as an infant can affect me now, let alone that my childhood experiences can shape my sexuality in such seemingly strong and tenacious ways, is proof of the unsettling complexity of our identity and its construction.  Add to this neurosis the Christian faith, and you have an even more complex dynamic.  How does one live in Christ while dealing with these issues?  What is going on through the paradoxical but crucial process of surrender or the idea of the now and not yet (both will be elucidated later in this series), such complex notions?  The homosexual Christian cannot help but face these questions.  I postulate as well that the way in which we are to act toward the homosexual is equally complex.  We must "love the sinner, hate the sin" - well, isn't that a bumper sticker and a half!  Sounds easy, eh?  We know that we cannot expect people to "fix" their lives as a prerequisite to the family of God.  We accept people as they are (as did Christ), but what does this mean when the people are a lesbian couple holding hands in the front row?  At what point does compassion and bearing with one another give way to admonition or church discipline?  These questions are Huge!  Lucky for us, we have a paraclete.  We need not crumble or dogmatize in the face of such complexity.  We need only do that which ought to characterize our lives:  listen and recieve from the Holy Spirit.  Only He can tell us what to do  in each situation .  (responses to timely needs)  We are all just as complex.  I believe strongly that one of the biggest battles the Christian faces today (and maybe always) is regarding complexity.  The world is constantly trying to steal our complexity!  They wish to label us, reduce us, tell us who we are, what we want, what we should do.  The world wants us to fit a type, or a category at the very least.  They balk and edit when we contradict, expect deception or denial when we defy categories.  They talk to us of "human nature" and "the way I am."  Brothers and sisters, let me suggest to you the way we are.   This summer, God gave me a beautiful epiphany on this subject.  As I walked up Casterline Hill near my house in Pennsylvania, I cried out to God, saying "It's no use, this is just who I am!"  He stopped me in my tracks.  He bade me look up, and I saw the most beautiful sight.  Above me, a wiry and robust tree spread its arching and intertwining branches against the blueblackgrey twilight sky.  Each branch bristled with buds and shot off other smaller branches which did the same.  The entire kaleidoscope seemed to proliferate and delineate endlessly while remaining stable-ly still, beautifully rooted against the colour-shifting sky.  "You are as complex as this sight," God said to me.  I was struck as if in the face by these words, and tears sprang instanly.  "Turn around."  I did.  Behind me stretched the rolling shapefulness of Casterline Hill, stretching up and out in both directions, melding with other hills and almost with the sky.  On this hill, grew hundreds (thousands) of trees just like the one I had recently devoured.  "I," spoke God, "am infinitely more complex than that."  Thank God.  Praise God.  Allelujah.

      Available now, the following merchendise (yay, capitalism!)  *patriarcheology......$5          patriarcheology is a collection of poems that mines the text of the Old Testament in an attempt to wake up the flannel board figures in our collective memories.  It is a slim volume of twelve poems (12...ah-ha) arsing from traditioanlly and untraditionally recognized Biblical patriarchs that charts a timeless journey of redemption.  *Bulrup...............$40 (still waiting for someone to help me lower production costs!)          The mystical card game of abstract agriculture that's sweeping the continent!  Get in on the movement now before the growing season is over.  *Hamilton postcard.....$1          You won't find this baby at Tourism Hamilton!  Not for the faint of constitution.

      It seems to me...  That writers (artists of all sorts?) often become disillusioned with this continent and head overseas.  Living as expatriots, they produce art that criticizes North American culture.  And yet, in this state (or out of this state, as it were), they are removed from the culture.  This means that they produce art criticizing "them" instead of "us" by the very nature of their absence (abscondance).  Is this valid?  Does their work become undermined by this separation?  And why do they feel they have to leave?  The politican, conversely, often becomes disillusioned and criticizes the culture BY STAYING.  What is the difference here?  Need there be one?  Is the artist possessed of a more sensitive nature that makes it impossible for them to go on or produce art in a culture to which they are opposed?  Or is that aggravating statement really true that art is "passion recollected in tranquility", their exile being the tranquility from which to compose?  Comments?

      This program keeps deleting my "Description", so I have decided to post it here for those who have missed it and therefore have no idea what I'm talking about.  It should read as follows:  A slave narrative from the 19th century tells of the glorious moment when a community of slaves in the American South were greeted by one of their own running across the fields toward them yelling "We're free!  MR. Lincoln just said we could all go free!"  This account, written when it happened, is dated 8 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.  Underground Rainbow is a call out of slavery and into freedom.  This call is especially extended to two parties:  the church and the homosexual.  We have lived as slaves long after our freedom was declared!  The Noahic rainbow proclaims not only God's protection and providence on the journey but also our beauty and diversity in His family.  I am running across the fields ripe for harvest, screaming at the top of my soul, flailing my love-scarred arms, yelling "We're free!"

      We must get over the belief that God owes us something.    In the account of the firy furnace, Daniel's friends tel  Nebuchadnezzar "If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and He will rescue us from your hand.  But even if He does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up (Daniel 3:17-18, NIV)."  Rebecca St. James paraphrases this response in her song "Carry Me High" by saying "I know You'll save me from the fire.  I'm Yours even if You don't."  Can we say the same?  Job, in the midst of his intense suffering, and after chapters of grievance against God, says "Though He slay me, yet will I hope in Him (Job 13:15a)."  This is even more unbelievable!  If these saints, faced as they were with trials far greater than we will ever encounter, can look Satan and his emissaries in the face to say "Even if God doesn't save me, I'm His," why shouldn't we do the same?  *God, You do not owe me heterosexuality, a wife and family, a job, Canadian citizenship, artistic success, financial confort, a place to live, or even this life.  I accept that life on Your terms, knowing You infinitely able to provide everything else.  But this is not for me to decide.  Did I lay the foundations of the earth?  Did I let the wild donkey go free?  No, Father, You.  I know that You can save me from the fire, but even if You never do, Lord, I'm Yours!*  Join me in this prayer, and we shall be set free from the fears and oppressions that keep us from His full life.

      "[T]he Lord is jealous for His children who are caught and trapped in the gay community. He is jealous for their hearts and jealous for their gifts, their creativity, and their beauty…. He is jealous for them because His Body is not complete without their presence. They are needed in His Body."                                          -Wendy Gritter, New Direction  Wendy Gritter declares that the Church is maimed without the gifts, personalities, and voices of those dealing with same-sex attraction.  Do you agree?  What unique gifts are available from this community?  Is this a subtle upholding of unhelpful stereotypes?    One criticism of the contemporary church is its flaccidity in and detachment from the arts.  It seems to me that drawing a connection between the arts and the homosexual is not an entirely stereotypical step.  There is a sensitivity and productivity in these fields that seems to bubble up from the gay personality in many cases.  Is it too simple, tidy, and restrictive to link this art-deficient church with a heterohomogeneous one?  And are these artisitc sensibilities the only unique contributions the homosexual brings?  [Note:  Throughout this site, I use the term homosexual to refer not only to those actively identifying themselves as gay but to those who are otherwise known in the church as "homosexual strugglers," "those experiencing (or struggling with) same-sex attraction," and "ex-gays" as well, myself fitting into the final category.]  What other lessons might the "straight church" learn from those who are experiencing or have come through same-sex attraction?  A bunch of questions, a few incendiary word-choices, and an unfocussed ramble all to say "Think about it."

      "He has forever perfected those who are being made perfect."  --Hebrews 10:14  This is perhaps the most important and wonder-ful spiritual truths I have ever come across.  How can this be?  If we are made perfect, then how are we still being made perfect?  And if we are being made perfect, we are not yet perfected.  Can both be true at the same time?  Good news for the one redeemed by Christ:  they are.  Both.  Right now.  The concept of the Now and the Not Yet is best illustrated by discussing the Kingdom.  What is the Kingdom?  Christ speaks of it in both present and future tense.  He ushers it in, and yet it is yet to come.  The truth is that Christ Did institute the Kingdom of God on earth.  He is its firstfruits and its Ruler.  And yet, as we the temporal can attest, the Kingdom seems to be anywhere but where we live.  We hope in the day that God will refine and redeem the earth, welcoming us to the New Earth He promised.  Isn't That Really the Kingdom?  There is no denying that we are currently princes and heirs in the Kingdom.  But it's fullness is yet to come.  The same is true of salvation.  The penitent is saved in a moment, and yet that salvation is an ongoing process, a world-long journey.  And, as the writer of Hebrews points out, this same concept is in operation in the area of our perfection (or sanctity).  I like to compare it to the Matrix.  Those newly aware of the Matrix's nature know that they have the ability to overcome and exceed the strictures and laws that they have previous accepted.  They know these laws to be illusory and their world to be a computer-induced hallucination.  And yet they cannot fly.  No one ever makes the first long-range jump without falling.  Why can't they do these things that they know are possible?  Because their minds will not let them.  In the same way, if they die in the Matrix, their mind, convinced of its demise, expires in the real.  They have been given (as it were) super powers, but the exercise of these powers is an unfolding and difficult process.  So it is in the Kingdom.  We HAVE been perfected (sanctified, justified) if we have given ourselves to our Creator's will.  And yet we find it so hard to realize (in both senses) this perfection.  What is to be done?  The only way to live out your perfection is to take its existence on faith and constantly remind your doubting humanity.  We will never reach our true sanctification until the Kingdom is in its fullness.  But we may journey ever closer.    This is crucial in the journey out of homosexuality.  There was a time when God revealed to me that I was heterosexual.  This was a funny and incred-ible idea.  And yet I knew t was true;  it had come from God's own mouth.  There were (and still are) many times when I had to remind myself of that truth as I found myself thinking in or living out of old patterns.  And little by little, I approached that truth by claiming its present and future truth and refusing all other claims.  This knowledge, this faith, this discipline is absolutely vital to our Christian walk and our continual molding into God's image.  Both Now and in the Not Yet.

      "All things are permissable for me, but not all things are beneifical; all things are permissable for me, but I will  not be brought under the power of anything."  As Christians, we have a great calling and an even greater destiny!  Unfortunately, we seldom understand either.  Christ does not call us into an empty system, a life under the Law, an exercise in following orders.  God does not call us into obedience to a vague law of love: doing good works, accepting everything, making our or others' lives as easy as possible.  Christ does not call us to a knowledge of His soveriegnty, thanking and asking.  Many of these things may flow out of our true calling, but they are empty, shallow tombs.  The truth is alive.  God has sent us His Spirit, given us freedom through His Son, and declared Himself in the Word and World.  He uses these to call us to something much more radical.  Something Radical because it does not fit into our world's epistemology or value structures, let alone our own.  Something sacrificial.  Something not about us, but all about Him!  "People believe a little too easily that the function of the sun is to help the cabages along."  -Flaubert  God does not exist to make us happy.  In fact, it could be said that we exist to mae Him happy.  "Created for His pleasure."  He does not owe us anything.  We owe Him everything.  The purpose of the sun is something altogether more complicated and grand than we can even articulate.  Our purpose here is to love God and to know God and to believe God.  We too often conflate the ideas of knowing something, believing it, and feeling it.  These are seperate things that do not always meet.  Some of the most powerful things I know, I seldom feel and sometimes do not believe.  But that knowledge cannot  be shaken.  It is not a foreign or novel idea that God's ways are beyond ours.  This is so often used as an excuse.  Let us not misuse it.  It  is simply true.  As a child, how much to understand the reasons behind the rules set down by our parents?  Sometimes we were faced with strictures that we saw no logic in.  And yet, we were told to obey, if not because we had faith inmour parents' fuller knowledge, than simply because we loved them and respected them.  Did they give us a stone?  I am grieved when I see a church looking for "more proof than a few Bible verses."  I'm sorry, but that is the only proof worth taking.  That is the only knowledge given us from outside this system of creation.  It is the only objective higher vision.  It is the sweet, fagrant, living Word of our Abba.  I do not cite Genesis as a proof of normative heterosexuality.  After all, there were no more homosexuals there than there were Caucasians.  With only two people, you have limited options.  If you are looking for Biblical evidence, however, check out I Corinthians 6:9-120, Romans 1, and I Timothy 1, but I am sure that anyone interested in this topic has had these quoted to them numerous times.  Ezekiel 16:49-50 indicates three social factors that led to the decline of Sodom: pride of life, adundance of idleness, and fullness of  bread.  This (very familiar) social context contributed to men "giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh," according to Jude 1:6-7.  This pattern is echoed in Romans 1.  "You have the Scripture and the Prophets..."  What harm does homosexual practice do?  This is the wrong question.  We don't need a roadmap of all the consequences to our actions in order to follow God's call.  Then we are obeying logic and common sense, not exercising faith in our Creator.  I know that this sounds harsh and hollow, but I do not apologize for God's transcendance.  The most obvious deriments to homosexual living are found most often prior to, not following, the acts themselves.  Homosexuality (as well as unhealthy heterosexuality) keeps us in bondage, brought under the power of our flaunted freedom.  It casts a disparaging eye on God's Word and doubts His faithfulness.  It upholds in us untrue and killing views of our own gender, worth, and need.  It is a symptom, not a disease.  It is the practicing of our brokenness.  Job, grand complaintant, spends pages and pages questioning God, looking for answers, crying Unfair!  And it is.  Isn't it?  It is unfair.  But God is not fair.  God is just.  And what is it that calms Job, that grants him the peace and faith of an upright man?  God's pages of questions in return.  God screaming "who are you and who am I?"  God defying Job's human box and petty system of belief.  God being God.  And Job places his hand over his mouth.  Job sees and is abashed.  In his exploration of the themes of Job, the delightful 'The Man Who Was Thursday', G. K. Chesterton suggests that life, and God, seem so mysterious, so sinister, so inscrutable and full of suffering because we have only ever seen them from the back.  Hidden with Moses in the cleft of the rock, we see Him pass by in His majesty, and the sight of His shoulder sears our face and makes us fearful to our friends.  (I cannot do this idea justice without the entire of Chesterton's text.  It's worth the read in many ways!)  The ways of God are not the ways of men.  And as His risen church, His true heirs, alive with Christ and seated with Him in glory, neither are our ways.  "For me, to live is Christ, and to die" (physically, intellectually, philosophically) "is gain!"  *God, grant us the humility to seek You alone.  Show us a glimpse of glory, a glance at Your spreading back, though we may never see You here face to face.  Bring us to the end of ourselves so that we may begin to live in Your Radical Life.  "Lord, all of my expectations come from you."  Be God.  Be holy.*

      I am sorry to not have been on the circuit much lately.  I have been moving between countries.  I am now back "home" and hope to rejoin Blogalia soon and more regularly.  But, first some questions:  1.  Am I the only one who can no longer see my comments??  Is this a Mac thing??  2.  Now that I am living in another country, should this blog take on more of a personal slant and focus less on the homosexual in the church??  Feedback is very appreciated, but hopefully I can actually see your comments!  We'll get it all worked out.

      It is only a short step from Complexity, Need, and Surrender to Reliance, but it is an essential one.  I have come to see that Radical Reliance on God is a bedrock for the Christian life.  But as always, "most things true are simple and complex (Caedmon's Call)."  We can do nothing on our own.  We can neither speak nor build nor love but through Christ's Spirit in us.  What hope have we in setting our futures in place, our problems in order, our feet on the Rock?  None.  But we needn't.  Some years ago, the ubiquitous and nauseating WWJD bracelet was somewhat replaced with the slightly more palatable FROG bracelet.  Fully Rely On God, these often-amphibianed bands proclaim.  And as cloying as their message is, it rings true.  If you will allow an equally mawkish object lesson arising from this acronym, consider the following:  frogs swallow by pushing food down with the backs of their eyeballs!  This is one of those Dillard-worthy quirks of nature trivia that has always fascinated me.  Because of this anatomical multi-tasking, the frog must close his eyes as he swallows (watch one, and you will observe the sinking in of the huge eyes as they perform their secondary task).    Likewise, should we not close our eyes sometimes to really take something in?  To really be nourished?  Is your focus on temporal and material circumstance frightening you from following God's lead and resting in His infinite care?  Perhaps you should shut out such "practical" considerations and put your trust in the only place it can rest: Him.  Swallow His peace and protection.  Maybe your problems seem "less" or "different" in your eyes than homosexuality.  They are not.  Just as the gay struggler often says that their impulses, desires, and tendencies impede them from God's fullness, your focus on the nuts and bolts of observable reality may keep you from His grace.  To both camps (which are really one), I say Fully Rely On God.  A hard truth to swallow, but the only way to a leap of faith....

        I am indebted to Valerie McIntyre and Leanne Payne for their insight into the demythologizing of Christianity and the need for resymbolization in the post-Industrial world.     &nbsp;

      "Adam fails;  he fails Eve, and the rest of humanity.  Let me ask you a question:  Where is Adam while the serpent is tempting Eve?  He's standing right there:  'She also gave some to her husband, who was with her.  Then he ate it, too" (Gen. 3:6 NLT).  The Hebrew for 'with her' means right there, elbow to elbow.  Adam isn't away in another part of the forest;  he has no alibi.  He is standing right there, watching the whole thing unravel.  What does he do?  Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  He says not a word, doesn't lift a finger.  He won't risk, he won't fight, and he won't rescue Eve.  Our first father -- the first real man -- gave in to paralysis.  He denied his very nature and went passive.  And every man after him, every son of Adam, carries in his heart now the same failure.  Every man repeats the sin of Adam ever day.  We won't risk, we won't fight, and we won't rescue Eve.  We truly are a chip off the old block.  ...  "Adam knows now that he has blown it, that something has gone wrong within him, that he is no longer what he was meant to be.  Adam doesn't just make a bad decision; he  gives away  something essential to his nature.  He is marred now, his strength is fallen, and he knows it.  Then what happens?  Adam hides.  "I was afraid because I was naked;  so I hid" (Gen. 3:10).  You don't need a course in psychology to understand men.  Understand that verse, let its implications sink in, and the men around you will suddenly come into focus.  We are hiding, every last one of us.  Well aware that we, too, are not what we were meant to be, desperately afraid of exposure, terrified of being seen for what we are and  are not , we have run off into the bushes.  We hide in our office, at the gym, behind the newspaper and mostly  behind our personality .  Most of what you encounter when you meet a man is a facade, an elaborate fig leaf, a brilliant disguise."  --John Eldridge,  Wild at Heart

      Well, long time and all that!  I have spent the past two weeks driving from Ottawa to Hamilton to Chicago to Fargo to Butte to Seattle to Surrey to Calgary to Winnipeg to Hamilton to Chicago.  (Might have left some out there)  No time now to talk about the trip, but James has some musings over on his  urlLink blog .  Amid the beauty of the West and the mindnumbing banality of the Midwest, I uncovered new areas of my friends, Erin and James (there's nothing to show you someone's humanity like a roadtrip) and got a lot of work done on my current manuscript.  This is a reaction to Dillard's  Holy the Firm  (the best book ever written barring Scripture) so heavily steeped with intertext of that book, I don't know what to call it.  I wasn't sure where it was going but I am very happy with how's it's grown.  I will post some excerpts here in the future.  Right now, I am in Chicago at a Pastoral Care Ministries School.  The head of Pastoral Care Ministries is Leanne Payne, and we have seldom seen such a wise Christian scholar (though she slips through the label of scholar as easily as she does the label of prophet or sacramentalist)!  If you have never read any Payne, pick her up (well, her books at any rate)!  Biting, diving, blossoming insight into the restoration of the Christian soul grounded in psychology, Incarnational Christian tradition, and Scripture.  In person, she is less dynamic but more delightful.  Honestly, like Carol Channing with a crucifix!  But check her out.  Some titles:   The Broken Image ,  Crisis in Masculinity ,  Healing Presence ,  Real Presence ,  Listening Prayer , and  Restoring the Christian Soul .
