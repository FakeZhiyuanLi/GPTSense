						   I want to be on The Price is Right.  I want to be whipped into a frenzy of excitement and prizelust from the audience by Bob Barker and Mr. Announcer-Guy.  The flashing lights.  The ringing bells.  The triumphant music.  This is my Dream.  They will call my name, and I will act surprised, even though I know it is my Destiny.  I will run down the aisle, in my white t-shirt with "Bob!  I spayed my cat just for you!" written in magic marker across the front.  Of course, there will be interesting designs all around those words as having just the words would make my creation look plain.  I will take up my post behind the bid display and grin into my little microphone.  Bob will stop the show for a moment to read my shirt to all.  In my spare time I have been pricing cheesy furniture, sets of golf clubs, cleaning supplies, cough drops, facial soap, everything that I can think of that I may have to bid upon to make it onstage.  I will be ready.  When the other contestants overbid, I will smugly bid $1, just to show off.  I have been watching the show since I was five, and I will proudly tell Bob so when I arrive onstage.  He will joke about feeling old, and I will joke about how he still looks so young... but then we will get down to business.  I have been practicing my putting, I have practiced running back and forth to switch price tags, if I am in a bidding game, I will look back to audience, appearing befuddled, just to include the poor slobs in the audience who came all this way to be on The Price is Right, but who did not know it was I who was destined to be onstage, not them.  My pricing expertise practically garuntees me a prize.  What will be behind the sliding doors when the chatter stops and they show me what I am playing for?  A gas range?  A riding lawnmower?  An entertainment center?  Or will it be the pearl of all prizes, the BRAND NEW CAR!!!  I do not know, the fun is the surprize.  If by some unlucky cicumstance, my pricing skills are not enough, and luck fails me in a game of chance, all is not lost.  There is still... The Big Wheel.  I have estimated the dimensions and weight of The Big Wheel and made an exact replica in my backyard.  Everyday I practice putting just the right force and momentum to the spin for the wheel to stop on the big 100.  Today I am practicing with the wheel starting on square 65.  I cannot lose.  I will move on to the Showcase Showdown.  Ah, the Showcase Showdon.  They will thread my prized together with a common theme, Jenny's Day at the Beach, or Candi's Picnic, augmenting the flavor of this perfect moment like the right drink with your meal at a fancy restaurant.  I almost feel sorry for the poor schmoe who is pitted against me... Almost.    My pricing proficiency cannot be matched.  Every item in my showcase will be scrutinized and my bid will be determined.  It will be close, and I will NOT go over.  They will go to commercial break, and when they return they will show my competitor's embarassing bid.  He probably will go over, the sad little fool, and I will laugh at him and shake my head at him and wait.  They will read my bid.  Bob will say "Actaul retail price..." and then the lights will flash, and the bells will ding, and the triumphant music will play for me.  All for me.  Bob will send his message to the petowners of the United States, and the credits will role.  And unlike my sorry competitor, I will not be backstage as the credits role.  I be will surveying my prizes.  Meeting the models.  Hugging my friends or family as the run onstage to share in my joy.    It will be my day.    It will be my Destiny.  Now, I must simply wait to win the lottery so I can buy my plane ticket to Burbank and fulfill my Destiny...

						   While my brother was here I took him out to the local all-you-can-eat seafood buffet (practically a must for someone coming from AZ to out here). It reminded me of another buffet restaurant that I went to while I was stationed in GA called Golden Corral. For those of you who don't know the place, it has just about everything you can think of in the way of buffet. Mashed potatoes, steak, pizza, fried chicken. Just all kinds of FOOD. I tell you what, that is one scary place. I went a couple of times before I really understood how creepy that place is. There are people there, mostly women, who you can tell eat at that place WAY too much. They are 300 pounds, and some of them have to have walkers to get around, but they are still piling the crap onto their plates. The waitresses all look harried and nervous, and they snatch the used plates off of the table in a hurry, as if they are scared of accidently losing a finger (or an entire limb) to one of the customers consumed in their feeding frenzy. You do not go to this place just to get full. You go to this place to gorge yourself on everything you can imagine... and then go back for seconds.It made me think... How much food do we really need? I mean, you don't even need to eat until your full even, and we as a society have decided to eat and not stop until it becomes hard to move.  Why can't we just eat what we need, the food we need to be able to survive and function?  Then we could put all the excess that we consume, and sadly, the amount that is cooked for our benefit at places like this that is not consumed, to better use.  When I realized how much the entire restaurant was  over-consuming  (myself included) I was disgusted.   Honestly, I think that if I could change one thing about human nature, the tendency toward gorging would be it.  Not just with food, of course, but money, power, anything.  There is only so much that each of us need, and the rest that we have can be shared.  I know that the world will never be that way,  people will continue to gorge themselves to the point that they can't move.  The best that I can hope for is to stick to the decision to never go back to one of those places again.  Or at least take only what I need instead.

						   Took a trip back home to Arizona this weekend and stayed with my parents, in the house I left when I joined the Army.&nbsp; I'm seriously thinking I should never go back.&nbsp; I hated that house, and it certainly hasn't gotten better since I left.   It feels like an animals den inside.&nbsp; Each room has one muted lightsource, except for the kitchen, where the flourescents stopped working before the last time I visited a year-and-a-half ago.&nbsp; All sunlight is blocked by dusty vertical blinds stained yellow from years of my parents cigarette smoke.&nbsp; The whole house is shrouded in&nbsp;the same&nbsp;film of greasy, yellow dust.&nbsp; The lack of light and the dust leave all color to be muted and subdued.&nbsp; The furniture looks like the background of an antique photograph that did not quite succeed in coming to life in front of you.&nbsp; The carpet is spotted with stains from spilled drinks and accidents from our two dogs, flattened by foot traffic, and limp after years of less than sporadic cleaning.   In the&nbsp;family room, there is a desk that is buried with old paperwork, older photographs, the boxes from Christmases and birthdays.&nbsp; A jumbled mass of general junk.&nbsp; The coffee table is covered with waterstains that somehow seeped under the lacquer, leaving white patterns along its surface that look like tiny lakes.&nbsp; There is a large, dingy couch where my mother sleeps.&nbsp; Lining the piano are family portraits, obscured by the yellow dust and some kind of dingy fur.&nbsp; Surrounding the TV in its cabinet are hundreds of videos dredged from the bargain racks and previously viewed bins of grocery stores.&nbsp; This 'family' room is only a family room on holidays.&nbsp; Everyone migrated to the solace of their own rooms years ago.   In the kitchen, every glass the family owned was used and lining the countertops, waiting for Someone to clean them and put them away again.&nbsp; Dotting these countertops are syrupy stains from soda spills someone could have cleaned when they happened, but instead were left to congeal.&nbsp; Along the floor are scattered trash bags waiting to be taken out through the difficult makeshift gate to the dumpster&nbsp;in the backyard.&nbsp; The flourescents do not work, despite changing the tubes, and the bulb in the refrigerator has gone out, even its meager light extinguished.&nbsp; On the fridge's shelves, as always,&nbsp;are the regular 2 liter bottles of coke and very little else.&nbsp; On the wall there is a clock with a different bird for every hour.&nbsp; Every hour on the hour it chirps like a robin, or hoots like an hour, or honks like a goose.&nbsp; If there was every glass over the face, it broke years ago as the hands are covered with that unidentifiable fur.    The backyard, which I have only been in about two times since we moved in, is dust buried in scat with a few strands of sunbleached grass.&nbsp; The aforementioned makeshift gate is an old set of boxsprings held up by two kitchen chairs, with various junk blocking the bottom to keep the dogs from escaping.&nbsp; The boxsprings were set on fire by vandals, leaving them to be nothing more than a wooden skeleton with a few flaps of charred fabric hanging off of it.&nbsp; Sometime since I left a small tree sprouted.&nbsp; They were convinced it was a weed until it actually started to grow branches.&nbsp; Personally, I think it is the next evolution of weed growing in my back yard.    The dining room, also only used by the family on holidays, is wear my parents live.&nbsp; It is where my mom escapes from life by watching TCM on cable or the VCR.&nbsp; Where my mother talks at my dad when she is in the mood to be social.&nbsp; The dining table is covered in old mail.&nbsp; The power bill is in my older brother's name.&nbsp; I don't know why particularly, but I think it is probably because my mother had an outstanding balance in her name from our previous home when we moved into this place&nbsp;seven years ago, and has never changed the name on the bill.&nbsp; Over the head of the table, there is some kind of mini-grandfather clock that tolls on the hour.&nbsp; Despite its small size, it rings like something out of a church.&nbsp; It is just one more touch of the surreal there.   The whole house hangs heavy with hopelessness, immobility, procrastination, inactivity,&nbsp; fear of ambition,&nbsp; lack of change.&nbsp; It is quicksand, and if I step into it too carelessly, I'll seep into its depths, sinking faster the more that I struggle to break free my screams slowly muffled by a mouthful of suffocation leaving...   Silence   &nbsp;

						    The Last -  The other day at work I needed a coke bad.&nbsp; I was not sleeping well last week, and I despise coffee and needed a caffeine fix.&nbsp; I walked on over to the 'soda fund' fridge in my area and find that the mysterious whom's who resupply it had not restocked in quite some time.&nbsp; All that was left in there was diet Pepsi and caffeine-free root beer... And one Coke.&nbsp; The Last Coke.&nbsp; Don't you just feel like the most special person on Earth when that happens, even if its just for a few seconds?&nbsp; Like Destiny stopped everywhere else for that moment so that you could find the  Last   X,  or so that a stoplight turns green right as you are pulling up so you barely have to slow down.&nbsp; Like, at that precise moment in the Annuls of Time it is written that my Coke would be waiting there for me.  &nbsp;   Shady Mags -  My wife made a mistake a few months ago and got plain suckered by telemarketers.&nbsp; This service lets you pay some small fee once a month for a year, and you get a subscription to 4 or 5 magazines for 4 years.&nbsp; The fee is quite low for the service, but we don't want the service.&nbsp; We tried to call them and get it cancelled.&nbsp; They wouldn't cancel it.&nbsp; They&nbsp;laid some&nbsp;shit on us about how they already paid for the magazine as part of their service and that we were technically repaying them.&nbsp; (She should have known better, and in the past she did.&nbsp; This particular time she was asleep at the wheel and agreed with the guy just to get him off the phone instead of hanging up on him).&nbsp; We then tried to dispute the charges through our bank, and our bank got our money back.&nbsp; Well, they came after us, and told us that they had my wife on tape making an agreement to pay for this service and that they would take it to credit reporting agencies if we didn't pay.&nbsp; (She should have known better than to agree, and in the past she did.&nbsp; She was asleep at the wheel that day and just agreed with the guy to get him off the phone instead of just hanging up on him... but that's how they work, right?)&nbsp; Well, now we're stuck with magazines for four years, and since my wife thought we were going to cancel it she didn't choose the magazines we were going to get so they chose for us.&nbsp; That's right, we are the proud recipients of "NBA Monthly," "Spin," "Winnie the Pooh," and "Basketball Digest" every month.&nbsp; If any further proof of this services legitimacy remained, it was quashed by the bill I received today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the DATE DUE column, not a day, but the word " NOW. "&nbsp; NOW!!!&nbsp; LOL!&nbsp; What a sack of shit.  &nbsp;   Jedi Runs Amuck -  This portion could be a little boring for... well... just about everyone.&nbsp; This is a rant by a gamer geek for&nbsp;gamer geeks.&nbsp; If you're still reading, you've been warned.&nbsp; Played  urlLink Star Wars Galaxies  for a little while last night.&nbsp; For anyone who doesn't know it's a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG).&nbsp; The time period takes place just after the destruction of the first Deathstar.&nbsp; According to the fictional timeline, Jedis are exterminated with extreme prejudice, so they have to be in hiding.&nbsp; Luke Skywalker is really the only one who is supposed to be running around in the open.&nbsp; There  could  be others, but they wouldn't be able to act like a Jedi out in the open without the risk of extermination.&nbsp; Well, players of the game want to live the Star Wars fantasy and that includes being a Jedi.&nbsp; Initially, Jedi were supposed to be part of the game, but they were supposed to be extremely hard to make and even harder to keep.&nbsp; After much bitching by the player base, they recently made the whole thing a lot easier.&nbsp; So last night I was going through Theed, Naboo,&nbsp;one of the largest cities in the game with a consistently large population of players.&nbsp; And running through it all, beating on other players left and right, was a Jedi named BadGirl.&nbsp; When she would off players she would taunt them, doing a 'wave bye-bye' action in game before killing them.&nbsp; Very much out of character for a Jedi, and very much against the timeline.&nbsp; Really pissed me off, and I'm even thinking about dropping the game, never playing again.&nbsp; Supposedly they are going to fix this stuff, but we shall see.&nbsp; Either way the game is going to be stupid until they put in the fix, with Jedi at every starport as others who play the game are claiming.  &nbsp; Anyway, all for now...

						   Well, tonight I found the blog of a good friend from long ago.  Reading through it I was completely shocked.  Not by the contents so much, but this friend had this entire life that I never knew about and never saw, perhaps never chose to saw.  Reading that blog was like a swift kick to the head.  Something about the whole thing bothered me, and I didn't understand what it was.  I had to go walking through the National Mall in DC to clear my head, and I finally realized what it was.  People, even people that I knew, people that I was close to, were objects to me.  Like puppets behind glass, I didn't even interact with them.  I only gazed at them and, for the most part, imagined myself interacting with them.  They were like dolls to me, for my own selfish use.  I constructed elaborate fantasies of conversations with them.  I created situations with them in my head.  In fact, these stupid fantasies became more real to me than the truth.  I also realized that  my  Life has been a fantasy.  But   worse   than a fantasy!  I built up the circumstances I'm in in my mind to be more than what they were, ascribed to them states well beyond their true simplicity.  I've tried to make them into the stuff of stories and been frustrated when they come out like reality instead.  Where the fuck have I been!?!  Where did my fucking brain go!?!  I mean, I've been dancing around the edges of these thoughts for months, maybe even years, but it took seeing this freind with a life of their own to realize  I've  been fantasising about  LIVING!   And not doing much more than that.  I've not been passionate enough about something in life to even attempt to try it.  I've been living my life in a daze, hoping that for once fantasy will match reality, that I won't have to play this shit in my head anymore and I can actually live it.  I hope for reality, but I don't do anything to make it a reality.  I'm done with it all!  I'M DONE WITH IT ALL!  Damn it, its really time for me to make a change.  It's time I stop trying to live in a friggin' book or film and start appreciating life.  No more intricate plots that I dream of playing out in real life.  I mean SHIT!  Why not just write the shit down instead of locking it up inside and using people as dolls on a stage in my mind!  Anyway, I'm calm now.  I'm going to bed.  Please just let me keep this.  Let me stay sane tomorrow and remember and break away from all this and START MY FUCKING LIFE!  Ya... calm

						   It's 12:30 am on a Monday as I write this.  I slept too much this Sunday as I often do on Sunday and now I can't sleep, so now I'm up blogging and watching Adult Swim.  I have to be at work at 6 later today, but thinking of that will only make me nervous and will keep me awake longer.  Lying in bed, trying to will myself into sleep (yes, I know it doesn't work) this thought entered into my head...  What am I made of?  More than any other question this one keeps me up and I hate it.  It is a panicky question that enters my head when, frankly, I have nothing else to think about.  Like when there is an awkward silence in a conversation and you attempt to fill it with shit.  Day in and day out, I have to distract myself with films, video games, message boards and any number of other bits of filler so that I can avoid that stupid question entering my head.  When I was younger I used to read and watch quality TV (when there was such a thing) and go on walks listening to music so that I could be   doing something  .  I'm not the best with people, and I would spend freaky time by myself wondering why I couldn't reach my friends or why my friends weren't reaching me.  Jealous that they were doing something and I was stuck with myself and my questions.  The entire time I kind of assumed that one day I would magically grow up and this problem would disappear.  I would know what I was made of and that would be that.  Since I can remember all I wanted to be was a husband and a father.  That was my one auspicious goal in life.  It was foolish in its own way (I'll get to that reasoning in a moment).  It was also a cop out.  To be fair, I'm not really into money or possessions at all, so it would be easy for me to assume that I would be perfectly content as long as I was a husband and father doing whatever to get by.  What I chose not to take into account is that I have a brain.  I have a soul.  I have all this pent up creative energy with nowhere to go (and now I'm blogging, imagine that).  I have no idea where I want to put all this pent up energy, so the goal of being a simple husband and father was my way to cop out of making a decision about where to put all of this... worth.  Sometimes I can kid myself, but deep down inside I  do  know I'm worth a whole lot more than I've allowed myself to become.  About being a father...  I absolutely love my kids.  I have three and I do everything I can to treat them like royalty.  Thing is, they cannot be my only goal.  They will go to school.  They will make friends.  They will have their own lives.  My mom always had a good quote for this.  "As a parent, you are the archer and your child is the arrow.  You can guide the arrow, but you cannot go where the arrow goes."  It is meant to be a quote about how much you can force you child to be something, but it also works in the point that I am trying to make.  I need more than being a father, because someday I am going to have an empty quiver and what do I do then?  (I can only tell you I can't exactly afford anymore arrows, LOL).  Furthermore, having a way to support my children financially AND a way that makes me content is healthier for my children, right?  Which, of course, brings us back to what this post is about.  What the hell am I made of?  My whole stupid life thus far I've hoped that there was a way that I could buy the answer to that question I think.  Or go out looking for it on a walk and find it in a bush somewhere.  I've hoped that I could find it in a passerby at the mall (though passerby would have to talk to me as I would never try to talk to them).  Or in the best film put out by Hollywood.  Yes, I used these things to distract myself, but I was also still looking, hoping for that magical moment that would allow me to finally 'grow up.'  I think its just frustration.  I want to know that I will not be my father, growing older and more... broken down every year, feeling he was never meant to be anything.  I want to know I won't be my mother, dissatisfied and looking upon the glory of her past and what she should have been.  I want love.  More than anything I want love.  I want music.  I want love that makes me  feel  like music.  I want to know and do what I was meant for...  but I want what I was meant for to not be overly ambitious.  *Perhaps that is the sticking point for a failure.  One who knew what they always wanted, but didn't feel like working for it.*  Anyway, I just wish that I could buy contentment for $12.95 at Target, in a little box with  "The Answer"  written on it in a pretty, stylized font.  Perhaps that'd be something I could market.  It'd be kind of like a fortune cookie.  It'd put a little descriptive tag on it that said "Your personalized Answer to all your deepest questions."   And then inside the little box would be a small, golden card that you would open and it would just say "Yes" or "T-shirts" or "Mule Kick" or, just to mess with one poor guys head I'd have one in a million say something like  "I'm sorry to tell you this, man, but you were never meant to do anything with your life.  Just curl up in a corner and wait for the end please and try not to get in anyone else's way.    By the way, I heard that the Wendy's up the street is looking for a good fry cook.  Sorry again, chap, but have a nice life anyway!"   That's it.  I think I've found my niche in life.  I'm going into the quirky novelty biz.  I love being able to say I'm in the 'x' biz!  ... but I still can't sleep ...  Just on a complete side note - What kind of blog site has 'biz' in there spell check but doesn't have 'blogging?'  Oh well...

						   I'm seeing the promos for Halle Berry in Catwoman now, and it absolutely typifies the side of Hollywood that I despise, and perhaps even the side of American culture I hate to look at.  From what I am seeing anyway, Halle Berry is cultivating less a character, more an image.  She learned how to strut like Catwoman.  She learned how to purr like Catwoman.  She learned how to wear tight leather like Catwoman.  Surely, she must  be  Catwoman, right?  Of course, Halle Berry isn't the only one to have a hand in this.  Directors, producers, casters, mareters and their Hollywood ilk all had a hand in creating an image they thought America would want in Catwoman.  In short, they all had a hand in deciding what America would buy.  From the previews, its looking to me like another film that is short on substance and big on image, like so much in America anymore.  As long as she struts, as long as she her fine body is packed into tight leather, and we throw in enough action sequences to distract them, maybe they won't notice that Halle Berry is just an actress trying to play Catwoman. The product no longer matters as long as you can make an image that America buys.  A few examples outside of Hollywood (which, for the most part, has become the cesspool of image).  The SUV.  The SUV isn't a gas-guzzling, lumbering deathtrap.  It is your escape from the mudane, humdrum everyday.  If you've noticed, in  their  they have stepped away from showing the SUV as the vehicle that takes you out adventuring.  After a long string of comics making fun of the fact that very few people own an SUV go offroading on the weekends, go white water rafting, go trudging through jungles.  The marketers finally caught on to that.  So what did they do?  Showed us that everyday of our lives is that kind of adventure...  in an SUV.   You  could  go offroading in the SUV... if you want to take a shortcut to the supermarket.  The SUV  can  take you to those class 5 rapids... but you can turn around when you get there and see how dangerous they are.  And that jungle... why that could be in your own garage.  Imagine it...  Fast food.  Now the media has all of freaking out becuase 50% of the nation is overweight and 33% can be considered obese, and the finger is being pointed at fast food.  So they are freaking out, and trying to put one or two 'healthy' items on their menus.  Despite what people think, this is not to attract the people on diets to their restaurants.  Face it, folks who are serious about losing weight aren't eating at McDonald's.  The healthy junk is so that when you are planning the trip out to lunch with the gang, the one guy who is on the diet has SOMETHING to eat there, at least in theory, and so he isn't the deal breaker for the whole group.  The greatest example of image in fast food has to be Kentucky Fried Chicken.  A joint with 'Fried' in the title is virtually garunteed to have nothing healthy for you.  What's there new campaign?  THEY'RE ATKINS FRIENDLY!  HA!  They didn't even make an attempt to change their menu (which you could really say for any fast food joint with their happpy new salads) they just tried to change the perception of their product.  I'd commend them for sticking to their brand, sticking to what their known for, but I think I have to deplore the complete lack of creativity.  There are several other examples I could go into detail on but I've drolled on long enough on these.  I will probably be back on this topic eventually, as I rant along these lines all the time, and I don't think I've even scratched to surface of my thoughts on this topic.

						   I took my three-year-old daughter to the park tonight.  I put her on the swings, and pushed, and of course, she loved it.  Eventually she hopped down and went into the sand and said "I make sandcastle for  you  daddy."  I sat in a swing and just watched her as she piled sand into heaps, and found little sticks to put in the tops.  Sitting in the park watcing her, I remembered when I learned how to use a swing.  It was practically the first day at school.  The other kids knew how to do it, but they had to show me.  I think the reason for that is because my parents never showed me how.  There was a lot of that in my childhood.  I learned how to tie my shoes from a babysitter.  Learned how to brush my teeth during dental hygiene week in 3rd grade.  There is a lot that I am still unsure if I am doing right.  Some things that I am simply not confident about, considering the lack of guidance at home.  My goal, as a father, is to make certain that this does not happen to my kids.  Its not so muc a matter of teaching them what they need to know as it is instilling in them the self assurance and that was not instilled in me.  I do not want my children to doubt if they are good people, or if they are doing things right.  I want them to understand that they are different from others, but it is a wonderful thing to be different, not a frightening, anxious thing.  I am only just beginning to come to terms with my difference from others.    Making my children certain of what they are doing and how they are doing it is the simplest, easiest step to that goal.  Not being closed to them, so that they know they can ask me the stupidest questions and receive an answer instead of ridicule is another step.  Showing them how to understand others is still another step.  Most importantly, of course, is showing them that they are loved.  I think I am well on my way.  My daughter amazed me, and really made me feel that she well on her way to being independant and confident, when she said this:  "Everybody like me.  Yeah... They smile at me."  I will do everything I can to make sure that she always feels that way.

						   Had this idea for a music video, probably while listening to Fatboy Slim at work.  Before the music starts, the video starts out with a long shot of a grey office, where grey suits inhabit grey cubicles. Their suits fit perfectly, and their matching ties are knotted perfection, their hair is combed into tight parts and buns, but not to the point that they are inhuman drones, they are just folks working. The sound of office chatter is prevalent as all of them are busy with their forms or their computers or their phones, completely wrapped in what they are doing... except for one person in the middle of the screen. He is sitting idly, comfortably, staring across the room. The camera begins to zoom in. As we get close, we see that his hair is not as sharp as the rest of the office perhaps spiked or dreadlocks if it was taken to the extreme, his suit doesn't fight tightly, and his tie is slightly loose.  They are really in the office.  He is not. He is watching the clock. Not anxiously, but with a slightly annoyed, impassive patience. A quick close-up of the clock shows the second hand creeping to five o'clock. As soon as it crosses the 12, the music starts, a slow, steady, quiet rhythm.  The sound of the rest of the office fades out.  Our main character gets up and steps out of his cublicle, the camera keeps a steady distance to his front.  He shuffles his way through co workers also leaving for the day.  All of them smiling at one another, chatting, showing pictures.  The main character is ignored.  Invisible.  Does not smile or interact with the rest of the herd.  The scene changes, our main character is now obviously in a club, and the music picks up to match the environment.  The camera keeps him centered, ahead of him by the same distance throughout, as he winds his way through the throng of clubbers, chatting, dancing, drinking.  Someone points at him and laughs, but our main character doesn't aknowledge him.  He gets up front, in front of the DJ and the speakers, and begins bob his head and shoulders, getting a feel for the rhythmn as the camera sinks down near the ground.  Immediately, we realize that the music is different for him.  He is not distracted by the other parts of the club, the drinking, the single scene.  He is there for the music.  The song hits it full force, and our main character begins to dance.  I wish I could be more descriptive than this, but he is good.  He is amazing.  While the rest of the crowd is shuffling their feet, he is doing intricate actions... but the focus is not the dance.  The idea is that he is not a dancer, he makes the music a part of him and his body becomes an instrument.  At first the crowd behind him continues what they are doing until they can't ignore him anymore.  He is really there.  They are not.  As the song ends, he stops dancing, glistening with sweat, and gets up and disappears through the cheering crowd, which he pays no attention to.  Its just kind of about where we really are, about where we flourish, where we are defined, at least those few of us how don't let the things that popular society says are ok define us.  About how those people at the office flourish where it matters in the society of making money and supporting oneself, but lose their identity in the process, where our main character is only there because it is a place to be to earn money.  His place isn't necessarily the club, but in the music.  The rest of the crowd (who I'd make the same folks from the office) don't understand where they are.  For them, it is just someplace to be, for the main character it is a temple, where he defines himself.  Even when he is finished, they do not understand.  The guy just really knew how to dance, not that the music has such a deeper meaning to him.  For effect I may leave the guy is his grey suit as he dances as well.  I don't know.  *shrug  Maybe a little confusing, but this post  is  something different.

						   I recently found the folly of being the source of rumors.  Last week, I told some members of my workplace that my supervisor had the impression that their section was 'lazy.' I had evidence of this, including my supervisor saying, when she had just arrived here, that she would go into their section when we were being slammed by work to find them just sitting there. Also, she has tried on a couple of occasions to get their section to do the little things that we don't have time to get to. You know, the bitch work. Point is, they work just as hard as we do. If they had been just sitting there, I guarantee that they were either waiting for film to finish in the processors so they could begin working, or they were waiting to be slammed. Even if neither of those were the case, they deserve their breaks when they get them. They should not be doing our shit work in their spare time.  Anyway, I've strayed into my opinions on the matter and away from the story. I told them this, thinking nothing of it, thinking that it was on a level with all the rest of the shit talking that goes on in the lab about my supervisor, or the other sections supervisor, or the decisions being made by our new upper management. I don't know exactly how it happened, but the subject was brought up in some kind of management meeting that my supervisor allegedly felt that the other section was lazy. Either one of the original people I told was talking about it and was overheard, making it third generation information. You know how that works. The first generation (me in this case) starts it, and I did state various disclaimers like the fact that the 'sitting on their butts' statement was months ago, but those details are edited out when being passed on. If the information is overheard, even more details are edited out and the rawest version of the worst of the story is offensive. Either it was a game of telephone, and the end result was taken too seriously, or I offended one of the two people I mentioned it to in the first place, and they chose to pursue it... Selling me out in the process.  Again, I don't know how it was brought up in the first place, but my supervisor insisted on learning the name of the person who started that rumor, and my name came down. Rightfully so, since it was my observations of some of her actions toward the other section that caused me to make that statement in the first place. My supervisor felt she needed to conduct damage control, and apologize to the members of the other section for the lies that were being spread about things she said. "Lies" applied here is a bit of a strong word, but I suppose it could be appropriate given that most of my facts were observations, so I won't quibble about that word's use. She not only felt embarrassed because of these lies, but betrayed because I am a hard worker and I am respectful to her even if I don't generally respect her. I got a stern talking to, and I suppose I've lost some of the respect of my supervisors and colleagues. That is somewhat depressing, but I suppose it is what I get for being so two-faced. I'd like to be disrespectful to her face. I'd like to let her know every stupid little thing we talk about behind her back. But it would accomplish nothing. I've seen it in the past. The ones who speak out here are sidelined, demonized, and finally transferred elsewhere, while the problem persists.  Something in the stern talking to that really stood out, my supervisor asked what would saying such a thing accomplish besides animosity between our two sections? I didn't tell her so, but I knew what the answer was. Attention. I'd like to say that I mean bringing attention to the issue, but it is not so noble. I realized that the reason I made that statement to the two people in the other section was because  I  wanted attention. Its the same reason that any of us are prone to gossip, rumors, or any other negative statements about others. Its a way for us to get attention without necessarily bringing attention to ourselves. Play down others and play up yourself. In my case, show how noble I am for sticking up for the people in the other section when oppressed by the misconceptions of my supervisor.  My final thoughts on the matter are this: Nothing I said was untrue, however, I may have misconstrued the facts. Perhaps when she made the "butt-sitting" statement so many months ago it was a moment when her mouth was ahead of her brain, before reason kicked in and realized that she should not be mad at them for not doing our work, and that if they were not busy they were preparing to be. Perhaps, as she said, asking to check if the other section is busy when we have bitch work to do is proper management, seeing if someone who is not busy can help out those who are. The real fact is that it doesn't matter. I never should have said it in the first place. What did it accomplish? There was no point in saying it other than being a tumbling little jester for a little while, in the spotlight for few measly seconds. Can I juggle for you now? Well I can't juggle, and I'm really not very interesting, so howsabout I talk smack about someone else?  Anyway, moral of the story is I guess I need to learn to keep my big mouth shut. Part of me finds that fact to be very ironic.   *I'd also like to take this opportunity to point out that I don't get in trouble for things very often, but when I do get in trouble it is for the stupidest things. This is why I have to be a goodie goodie all the fricking time. Because if I'm getting in trouble for the stupid things, what can I expect if I do something major. The god's are watching me all the time and they want me to be on the straight and narrow, and there is swift retribution for any deviance from that path, LOL!

						   I'm like... getting all serious about myself and stuff.  For the first time in my life, I'm really beginning to take care of myself. I've become important to me.  Here are some of the things that I have done or have been doing recently:    I have lost over 20 pounds. This is the accomplishment I am most proud of. I'd been meaning to lose weight, and one day I just decided to finally start losing it instead of feeling miserable when I ate. I've cut down to one cola a day, and I've severely cut down on snacking. The real factor to it was, of all things, reading some articles in a recent Time magazine which essentially listed out how we are hard-wired to believe that sweets and salt are necessary but hard to comeby, despite the abundance of food for our society these days. It just made me realize that we only need to eat what we need to survive, at its base what we need for fuel, and the rest is just excess. If you couple in the feeling that I think we are being exploited by the fast food and junk food industries, vying for our dollars and making the food as appealing (unhealthy) as possible, losing the weight became kind of easy... kind of...  I run over 3 miles every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I'm working on over 4 miles. Those of you that know me know I  hate  running.  HATE  it! But now I get out there and do it (and it is definitely a contributing factor to the weight loss). I've even gotten into a habit of running on days I'm on leave, sometimes weekends if I miss a day during the week (or if I pig out at an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet). One big difference between this and when I've had to run in the past is that now I am doing it  on my own.  I'm not in a group of other Army folk who will give me crap for falling behind or walking, it's just me. Running 4 freaking miles. Our new commander insists that everyone in my unit be able to complete a 4 mile run in 36 minutes. Well, a couple of weeks ago we had our first unit run. Out of 20 people in my section, I was one of the 6 who made it all the way to the finish, without falling out. Yah, people were very surprised.  They are planning on giving me an award at work, just for working. For those that don't know, it's a new shiny to put on my prettiest uniform, but it is also points toward me getting promoted to Sergeant. That nets me a nice raise, as well as a boost in respect, responsibility, and honestly, pride in myself. They are giving me an award because I deserve it, but also because it will help me out with the promotion. People say that I am working at least one and possibly two grades above my current level. So the award is both for working so hard and because they feel I should be paid and respected at the level that I am working at.  In addition to the award, Army classes will help me get promoted as well. I am taking them online when I get home from work. To give you guys an idea, I need about 550 points to get promoted, and probably more than that. I currently have about 430. The points for promotion are divided into different pars. There are 200 points for military education. I have about 40, maybe even less. Five credit hours of these Army BS classes get me 1 more promotion point. I have 800 credit hours to go to reach the maximum for mil ed. It is harder than the run sometimes. Especially as Army writing is written for the eighth grade level. That is not sarcasm, it is really written toward the eighth grad level. They feel that is the most effective way to get through to their audience. It is mind numbing... but I am doing that too.  I have decided to go to school to do what I really want to do. I'm going to write. I want to write professionally in any way that I have to or can to sustain myself, and write novels and perhaps a screenplay or two for me (and maybe someday I could live off of those). Its looking like right now I may have to settle for being a teacher and writing in my time off, but we will see. My short term goal for now is getting an associates degree and then working from there. We'll see where that leads. Oh, and 100 points out of the promotion scale are allotted for civilian education, of which I have about 25, and I get 1 and 1/2 a point for every civilian credit (for my 6 credit English course I got 9 points).  The last thing that I can think of at the moment is that I don't really do video games anymore. It used to be something I did every night for hours on end, especially when I found the on-line games. Now, I just don't find the time. There is a stress on  don't.  Its not as though I can't find the time, its just that when push comes down to shove, I choose to do something else. It's not so much that I stopped enjoying them, I just enjoy doing other things, which also happen to be more constructive, more often. In fact its been weeks since I have done anything more than turn on and turn off one of my games after a few minutes.   Anyway, I feel pretty good about feeling good about myself. I've even made willful efforts to stop procrastinating on stupid stuff, like mowing the lawn. With that, I actually just think of my parents, and the adverse affect procrastination has on them. I've just been dying to get this out:  My mother is driving without proof of insurance. Allegedly, she  had  insurance for once, but she had it in the car's owner's manual in the backseat. Someone stole the manual thinking it was some kind of wallet, and took the insurance with them. Now, I don't know whether or not to buy this story, but what I can say is that even if my proof of insurance  was  stolen, I would be calling the insurance company and getting a new set. My mother, of course, has not done this simple thing. Furthermore, she is driving without current registration, just waiting for a cop to pull her over and ask her for proof of insurance. Incidentally, the reason they do drive without registration is because they generally don't have the required proof of insurance to get the car registered. They normally get it for one month while they register the car and then let it lapse. At least my mother is  FINALLY  driving with a license now after years of not having one. Two months ago, she would have been driving without insurance, registration, or a license. And she had already spent a night in jail for this same thing (quite a few years ago but still). When do you learn, and how hard is it to renew your license, set aside some money for insurance every month, or every six, or every year, and be able to register your car? Anyway, I am no longer freaking out about turning out like my parents, and believe me, it was a worry with the way I handled things in the past. That is the greatest weight that has been lifted for me these past few months as I've started to get myself in gear, that I have finally made the decision to be nowhere near my parents level of... apathy.

						   Going to the store to pick up some film for my brother, my daughter picked up a Hello Kitty disposable camera. We've gotten her a disposable before, and she was so happy when she found it (not demanding as little ones can be) so I picked it up for her. She took it home, stacked up some checkers she'd been playing with all day, and proceeded to burn 15 exposures on an extreme close-up of the stacks, and then a couple on her uncle the night before he left town. By the time we went out to the Capitol Mall, she didn't have any exposures left to take a picture of the Washington Monument like she wanted.  I came back from a run the other day, and she had woken up while I was gone. She was very excited to see me and ran up and gave me a hug. Then she said "Daddy, your shirt all wet?" I said "Yes, daddy's shirt gets all wet when he goes out to run." She said "Yeah." Went out for a run this morning. My daughter was awake when I left and I told her where I was going. I asked for my bye-bye huggies like always, and as I was on my way out the door I hear her from the living room "Daddy, you no get your shirt all wet!"
