      hmm basically whether u care or not, i will be writing a section on yours truly! My name is Katie for those of u slower ones and i, like many people, have a mom, dad, siblings, and a dog. And since no one really cares about my parents and brothers   i will start with my dog. she is about the cutest thing on 4 feet and i luv her to death! basically my fav thing in the world to do besides hang with friends is to take a WALK! i could take on everyday and i pretty much do. my normal walkin buddies are chelsey and laura but im open to ne one. i also LOVE being outside and jumpin on my trampoline. i like to eat...alot as many of u can attest to but thats ok cuz food is good! i am also   the PRESIDENT thats right the PRESIDENT of FCCLA! gosh i love the sound of that! :P and basically we will be a better president that michelle   ever was! well this is it for now...xoxo

      oh man... well for those of u that dont know already...mal is my bestest friend in the entire world! honestly i could write a book about the girl but for not ill just stick with a paragraph or two..or 50! lol some of our fav things to do are go to china buffet and come out with certain items   lol and also take like 7 fortune cookies on the way out. go to walmart and talk with tony the greeter   and give shoutouts over the intercom   wearing pink funny robes around, and rockin out in the music department. we love getting new nail polish and makeup like everyday and pampering ourselves in any way possible...even if it means using canola oil, mayonnaise, and other various items. "pimping" is also one of our fav weekend activities that we have become very good at..almost too good at! WE WERE MOONED!!! but we do meet our share of hotties and other mb's that we like to fight with. we also enjoy writing messages on ppl's cars...only nice things of course! lol another aspect of our friendship is the color PINK!!! OH MAN WE LIVE FOR THAT COLOR! basically our dorm room that we plan to have will be focused on that color and that color only! umm sometimes we get a little "horn happy" when we are driving and just go crazy, but usually its pretty funny...cept when so freako lady tries to kill u....literally! to sum it up we are inseperable and pretty much the coolest and funniest ppl u will ever meet! :)
