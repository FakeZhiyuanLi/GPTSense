       Well, the camping is postponed until tomorrow after church.   wahhhhhhh... I guess no one prayed. You would not believe the storms we're having here in Sydenham!  I was terrified to an upright position at 5 am this morning by the mother of all thunder claps.  It took me a few minutes to get my heart rate back to normal.  It really sucked because I haven't been sleeping well and it seemed like I had just gotten to sleep when it happened.         2 of my gold fish have been acting funny.  They have been chasing eachother all over the tank.  I think they have the hots for eachother.  Do goldfish get the hots?   The really funny thing is the looks on all the other fish faces.  They kinda hide behind the rocks and act like they aren't watching but they totally are!  They sorta  turn away but  watch out of the corner of their eyes.  Sorta over their sholders(if fish have sholders).    They are a little community in there.  5 fish sharing one room.  No privacy!  It's like my worst nightmare.  I love privacy although I have none.  I can't even use the toilet without a child asking me for something.  My showers are interupted by peek-a-boo games from around the curtain.  There isn't even a lock on the bathroom door.  It's a good thing the kids nap at the same time and go to bed at 8 otherwise we would have some issues.   Well, I have too much to do to be sitting here typing all day.

       Well after urgings by those I love I have started my very own blog! I hate the word blog. It's probably for the best that I start writing down the things that travel through my brain.  I've been a total freek with my family all week.  Soooo grumpy!  GRRRRRRR.  I guess it's hormones but that doesn't help me at all.  We are going camping this weekend if the weather permits.  Jon, katie and Jeremiah are coming with us to Sand Banks park for a night.  It should be interesting.  It's rediculous how much stuff you have to pack for ONE night.     Well thats it for now. pray for no rain!  Launie

       Ok, so I'm pregnant...again.  This is number three.  Nobody told me that the body just quits trying to hold it's form after this many.  I have sags on my sags.  Those lovely old stretch marks have there own personal stretch marks now.  It's still very early on and already I'm feeling things like cramps and pulls.  I didn't know just how tired I would be.  I don't remember these things from before.  And peeing three times in the night is really screwing me up!  How could I possibly have so much liquid in there!  I only drank one glass but instead of it all coming out at once it has to spread itself out over a period of hours.  You have know idea how frustrating this is unless you've been through it.  First of all your so tired it's all you can do to get up and make something to eat because your so hungry that you've got the shakes.  But even more when you actually get a chance to get some sleep your wakened by your painful bladder begging you to get up go pee.  And so you drag your exhausted self up and navigate your way to the bathroom trying not to trip on the toys that are right in your path.  You lower yourself down onto the toilet trying to center yourself as not fall off, or even worse in, all the while trying not to wake up  too much.    You make your way back to your bed and flop down trying not to wake your husband with your heavey breathing, telling yourself that your not really in that bad of shape.  Then you realize that your whole uterus is contracted and the tightening seems to be getting worse since having to pee so badly....  Ahhhhhh now you can go back to sleep except...   Your wide awake!!!   So you pray or breath deeply or whatever it is you use to relax and after a while you drift off into a deep sleep only to be wakened and hour later by either  your bladder once again or even worse a screaming child.

       Why is it that tooting is so funny?  I'm an adult and still almost every time I toot I can't help but laugh.  Almost meaning not when my embarassment would prevent me.  I really dislike the word fart too.  It seems so crude.  It's a dirty word really.  Toot seems so innocent even when the smell is anything butt.  hehe.  My first memeory of tooting was a K-Mart.  My parents were talking to someone we had run into and I guess I let one rip.  My Dad looked down at me with a scowl on his face and said in a quick whisper "pinch!"  I'm still not pinching as much as I should I'm sure.   Is it not amazing that we each have our own brand.  For example...I know my Dads toots.  they have this really strange tangy smell.  It's one of the ones thats simply unbearable.  The  *plug your nose and run for it kind*.   Then theres the infant ones that are as close to pleaseant as a toot can be.  I also find it funny that we enjoy our own toots.  Even taking deep breathes to enjoy the full bodied aroma.  Or maybe only I do that...hmmmm.  I get a real kick out of the on your lap ones.  Its just to funny when a baby is on your lap and they think nothing of just letting them rip.  Funny how certain foods make a differnent odors too.  chili, cabbage...  My hubby is the  King  of gas.  loud and proud!  Isn't it gross when you both have gas and go to bed only to wake up in the morning to find the whole room filled with this haze of toot.  Nobody lite a match or we're goners!  Or when you've been sitting on the same chair for a while and when you get up this really stale toot has been lingering just waiting to escape.  PU!  Well,  I could go on but my mother would be so ashamed of me that I'm gonna quit there.  Please be kind and pinch until your outside.

       So we went camping and ended up at Wesley Acres Campground beacause everywhere else was FULL!  It turned out to be an awsome time.  I haven't gut laughed that much in ages.  We had a barbque and a camp fire with roasted marshmellows and spider weiners.  We spent time at the beach where they had an in the water trampolene.  It was great until I realized I was burnt!  My back is a hot tomato colour you wouldn't believe.  I took the time to lube the kids up but forgot myself.  Bad news for me.  I didn't realize that it's considered a radiation burn.  That sounds so scarey.  No blisters thank God.  Thank you Jesus!  Now when I go into the sun it feels like I'm getting roasted for dinner.  Lot's of meat on this set of bones I tell ya. Well time for a nap.
