      OK so Im new at this.  I stumbled across some other blogs and they just seemed like a cool idea.  No I dont know the little symbols and shortcuts for words and stuff but I'll learn (i hope).  So were do you begin these things?  Lets see..    Im divorced and have three children and two step children.  Which really just kind of sums my whole life up!  Nothing more really needs to be said.  We dont have a car.  We did have a car - a 1988 Buick Regal.  I dont know how many miles it had on it 'cause the odometer stopped working at 165,000.  The gas gauge didnt work and since the mileage didnt work either it made driving very, very interesting.  Lets just say I was really glad when TDOT starting letting those green trucks roam our highways to help poor stranded people.  Me and some of the guys who worked the trucks were on a first name basis.  The car finally just died about 6 months ago and since we didnt have any extra money I fiddled with it here and there trying to get it to do something (besides leak gooey stuff all over the driveway).  But the children were starting to get embarrassed 'cause Id be covered in oil and other crap when their friends came by.  The man at Auto Zone was sick of trying to explain things to me, etc.  I finally gave it to a guy just to get him to haul it off.  Getting another car would be a great idea but coming up with a down payment isnt.  As for the children - I use the word 'step' very loosely because my children and/or 'step' children really have no concept of the word and never ever use it.  Ask any of them how many brothers/sisters they have and each will give the same answer and it doesnt involve the word 'step'.  Funny thing is they all have the same father but none of them see him (thought he only lives about 20 minutes away).  He is nothing more than a financial contribution in their lives.  He does say ‘hi’ online at times but all the kids swear after he says ‘hi’ he always says “well Ive got to go know and take a shower).  My son said the last couple of times he’s gotten on he’ll im his Dad say ‘hi’ then say ‘well Dad Ive got to go and take a shower”, then he blocks his id.  OK so I know its not very nice but trust me the ‘Dad’ deserves all he gets!  The children do spend lots of time with each other and to me thats all that really matters.  I dont see much of any of the kids these days.  As a matter of fact my boss saw my youngest and one of her oldest sisters the other day at the grocery.  So I asked by boss how my daughters were doing...lol.  Seems its just me, the dogs and the cat hanging out.  The cable hasnt been on for a few weeks (thats another story...) and those few channels we get seem to get old really fast.  It seems that everytime I turn it on the only show I can find is Method Man and Red.  Which is funny I must say but I keep seeing the same one over, and over, and over again.  So Chaka Khan ends up at the bday party doesn’t she?  I do have a computer at home but its fried like bad chicken.  My brother decided (without my help) a while back that I needed Windows XP but used a bootleg copy, (because a good copy would require making a purchase and making a purchase would require a JOB) so the computer freaked out, doesnt work and I cant reload XP 'cause using a bootleg copy gives you an error message.  My 18yr old has a laptop but the battery on it has gone on the blink so thats no help.  Meanwhile Im paying extra every month for an additional phone line so we can be online and still use the phone.  Lord help us.......  My children (the ones at home - oldest fem 18, middle male 16 and youngest fem 12) are really good about making sure I know where they are, who their with and they never seem to (fingers crossed) get into any serious trouble.  Yesterday morning when I left for work two children were home.  The oldest was leaving for work, the middle was in bed and going to work a little later and the youngest had already been gone for a few days.  By the time I came home from work I had a note from the oldest saying   ".......luv ya Mom.....staying at....call ya later....", the middle child had already called and said ".....if you dont mind....yeah I'll be home sometime tomorrow...." and I had spoken to the youngest earlier who said "....yes I found the money you left....oh I took a 12 pack of soda...well no I really dont like the shorts….."  Its summer so I guess everybody should have fun.  Problem is.. well.  Baya and Bindi (the dogs).  They have to be taken out each morning and hooked to their leads which cant be too close together because then they get tangled up and you come home and their smashed against each other stuck ‘cause their so tangled and you wonder exactly how long they’ve been like that and you know that old lady up on the corner has been watching them all day and has probably called the dog pound or something ‘cause I treat my animals so bad.  She has on occasion come down and actually gotten them off their leads and put them in her basement because she said “…..it was so hot outside”….  Another big problem is Bindi is part Jack Russell and part Bassett Hound (no I don’t know!!) so she’s really short and Baya is a bull dog so she’s really tall.  You have to take them outside one at a time and hold onto their collars ‘cause they WILL run away.  Oh eventually they come back usually with a pissed off neighbor ‘cause they’ve mauled the peoples trash or Bindi has acted like she’s super dog and made them think she was going to bite off their leg (although there was that incident with the flower delivery guy once….).  They did have a leash which made it easier to get them outside and inside but Baya ate it and yes I had PROOF that she ate it!  I had surgery in early May so bending and that kind of thing really sucks.  Then of course they have to have food and water but not too much food ‘cause then the dogs behind us come down and eat up all our dogs food and then our dogs get all crazy and knock over their water bowls.  Then when someone finally does get home the two of them are standing there looking all pitiful with their tongues hanging out a mile cause their dying of thirst.   Then they have to be brought in each evening because Baya is afraid of the dark and if you leave her outside she barks all night and pisses off all the people who live around me.  And then theres the cat - Angel (dont let the name fool you) who absolutely, positively hates my guts and every other part of me (trust me the feeling is mutual) who I swear only POOPS in that liter box when Im home so the smell drives me absolutely INSANE (yes Ive tried every cat liter known to the free world – the kids always say ‘…….oh Mom its just you….’) and who cries constantly to be fed or petted or some damn thing then when I do try and be nice and give her a little pat she bites me!  And the big yard that everybody wanted to have because no they didnt really want to move into an apartment and "....no problem Mom....we'll keep the yard mowed..." which turned into ".....you know we really need a riding mower.....  So most of the time Im mowing it or cussing 'cause its not mowed or trying to find the right kind of line for the weed eater or that stuff your suppose to mix with the gasoline, which I never do right.  When I went to the doctor for a check from my surgery I had on flip flops (or flops as we call them) and he wanted to know why my feet were green (ok no you should never, ever, ever, ever, ever mow the grass in sandals, flops or barefoot… ok I said it….)  he wasn’t thrilled with the answer.  Then theres the laundry.  And I dont care what you say ‘cause I know without a doubt in my mind that it reproduces in my house someplace!  I dont know where yet (although Im betting its under my sons bed) but someday Im gonna find out.  I'll bet its the place that the socks keep going.  Thats it socks go there and out spits miles of shirts and pants!  And of course the dinners I keep making and keep throwing out which really pisses me off since money is always an issue and I feel like I might as well just be flushing 20's down the toilet.  And you cant give 'people' food to Baya or Bindi cause if they eat anything but the cheapest dry dog food they get 'the runs' and its never outside in the yard and since none of the children are ever home…...  The cat leaves 'little presents' all over the house if she eats anything with seafood or chicken (which makes buying cat food a pain in the butt) so you cant give her any 'people' food either.  OH LORD THIS FEELS SOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD...............
