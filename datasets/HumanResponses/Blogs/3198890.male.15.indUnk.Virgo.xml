      I'm going through major tip withdrawal. I've played Scotty Doesn't Know like literally 50 times today and my cousin that at my place thinks I don't know any other music, so he came and handed me like 10 cd's and he was like you should play these. Today's my first day home since I had to go up to DC, so it feels like Sunday, the day after...and I just feel sad all round. A last thanks to all you great tipsters for making my 4th year the best at our crazy crunk campus. We're gonna have a bunch of reunions everywhere and tipsters must keep in touch this year.  SCOTTY DOESN'T KNOW

      I hope we can get a lot of people on this thing, TIP '04 should never die!  btw, I'm Russell. Most of you should know me, but I was the kinda-short 4th year with blonde highlights and brown eyes. Not Carter or that Eye of the Tiger dude though.

      I hope I spelled that right, because I take French, not German. Anyhoo, I have arrived at the blog, and will try to do something in my account so that you guys may be able to remember me. For those of you who don't know me, check DRag's page. I am Robbie "Dobbie" Cameron, the guy being thrown out the window. On that note, rock out, and never let TIP die!  -Do what now?

      Alright so i was tacky in quoting a song for the title but hey wtf. Umm try to post i hope that this site will really get going and im going to try to invite Daag, Sam, and Marc too.  If you have live journals go ahead and post a link thanks guys. Also you can upload images on blogger so i think its better than livejournal then again they might be able to do that as well.  - Touche!
