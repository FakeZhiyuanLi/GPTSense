      Things in my last post seem to have resolved themselves. Which is good because I do not like feeling hostility towards people or vice versa.  I cannot fucking wait for the weekend. Last weekend SUCKED, as I had to work on a short film all weekend. And by all weekend I mean every god damned second. I plan to be either a) drunk or b) hungover this weekend. I plan on doing nothing productive. It's actually a nice feeling knowing I have no agenda.  My improv graduation show is tonight and I really, really don't want to do it. Really.

      I finally had "my" time last night. I have an issue with setting aside time for myself. Mainly because I get so fucking bored after an hour. So, to revel in myself, I sat on the couch all nite. How lame. I hate TV, and I watched sixteen episodes of Seinfeld. What the f? I seem to have lost all motivation to do things since I got back from Italy. Well, unless it involes putting a drink in my mouth.

      I have an obsession with Taco Bell. I seriously could eat there all the time. And I don't even eat their normal food. I'm really into TB Modification. Like Bean Gorditas Supreme Style No Sour Cream or Nachos Del Grande No Meat, Add Bean. But who really cares about any of that? My main Taco Bell fixation is their hot sauce. Whoever devised these sweet packets of joy must be given some free TB for life. And now, they have those funny little sayings on them that make them so much more than they ever were.

      A while ago, which means the other day, I made up the word Sleg. A Sleg is when you have an ass that directly connects to your leg. As opposed to being two separate entities.   So today I discovered I have a Sleg. Sucks.  We got Pixies tickets this morning. It's like my friend Dinese has superstar ticket buying qualities, because we got fourth row. The best.

      There are good things about having a boyfriend: hangin' out, hangin' in, diamonds, free beer. Then there are some things that aren't: phone calls.   You see, I went to class last night and a few of us went out for pizza and beer afterwards. And apparently 'other-half' has single guy radar. So he calls. Like FOUR times. But of course I'm having 'my time'* so I don't answer. I mean, he knows where I am, right? So I call him back at like 11 and I'm all "what's up yo. you buggin'?" and he is pissed. Pissed as in he's being a big f-ing baby that is driving me crazy (just for that moment). So I try to calm him down. We hang up. Things are cool.  Well, I took the super long way home because someone tried to kill themselves on the highway. That said, he calls back like 10 minutes later when I should have totally been at home, washed face, contacts out. And I'm still drivin'. This is totally suspicious behavior and I know it. So he's like, "you see the work i did on your deck." And I'm all, "Um, no...I'm still...uh...driving." And (no shit), he says, "You on a date?" What? The? Hell?  And I thought girls had all the issues.  *'my time' = any time 'other half' is not around. Doesn't matter if it's spent at the gas station, asleep in bed, or hanging out with people.

      I think my life continues to get more mundane each day I grow older. I spent like 6 hours last night cleaning my house. Something I would have never done when I was, oh say, 25. So, there's really nothing interesting to say on here. Sponge. Laundry. Placemat. Is this entertaining?  I was supposed to go out w/ a friend last night who had a family member die recently (six months ago). It's not that I'm a heartless bitch, but I really don't want to sit around and dwell on death. I mean, I've dealt with it. I don't like re-hashing it. It's a part of life. A part of the process. But I ended up getting stood up and was extremely grateful.  Tonight is Improv, and I have decided I am entirely unfunny. Thank god my friends are drunks - it gives them a false sense of my humor.

      I once made this pact with myself (two days ago) that I was to stop drinking. At least for a week. And I ended up going one full day. I think I have issues beyond what I wish to believe.

      It's the freakin' weekend baby, gonna have me some fun.  Well, someone hates my fucking guts apparently. I planned a four day trip to various pools around Atlanta and that dream is now unfulfilled. I hate you El. Oh and the rain.   Went to Daniels last night to play games. Should not go out and drink champagne after eating spinich for dinner. After Daniels, J, M-lo and I went to Lenny's. I rear-ended a car and J threw up on my ankle. It was a good time had by all.  We get off at noon today. I'm gonna pool it. I don't care what noone says. El.

      Babysat last night. Wasn't feeling so hot from the night before (played Yahtzee w/ J and B). Kids can really wear you out. I'm glad I have M-lo to help. He let Liam sit on his motorcycle for like 16 hours, keeping him throughouly entertained. Then Liam fell out of bed. Remember that shit?  Going over to Daniel's tonight to play games (again). He has got to be so bored. He said he's gotten into sports and soap operas. How shitty.   Ready for the weekend. Hoping to spend a lot of time at the pool preparing for next week's beach jaunt. Get out at noon Friday to start it all off.   This is not very exciting. Any of the stuff I just wrote.

      Had a good weekend. Friday went to J's and we drank champagne and M-lo fell asleep and we put his hand in hot water so he'd pee. He didn't. Saturday went and hung out at the pool with L. Went and met B. and went to a bunch of parties, Highlander, another party, etc. Very tired on Sunday. Very. Played Dodgeball. Sore.   Last night I mulched my garden. It's really nice to see something you made grow. They're like my babies execpt I can eat them.  Work is kind of slow right now and I wish everyone had jobs that you could work when you had work and not work when you didn't.   I need a brow wax.

      It's 3pm Friday and this day is taking forever. I've written so much stuff today it's killing my creativity.  Not doing too much this weekend. Trying to lay low, not spend money. Boring as hell.   Went out for a little last night. I got a wild hair after drinking almost a whole bottle of champagne and dragged M-lo to 97 Estoria. Hung out w/ a few peeps and was in bed by 12.   I am so not interesting today.

      M-lo told me the other night that all I could say (re. Tuesday's drinking fest) was:  1. I am so drunk. 2. I only had 2 1/2 margarittas, and I am so drunk. 3. I'm sorry I'm so drunk.   God.

      I'm tired and I don't feel like writing my scripts but they are totally due today.   Went and saw Coffee and Cigarettes last night. Half the theatre walked out during it. I guess it's easier to do when it's free. It was decent, just long at parts. Iggy Pop was really strange in it.  Then we went to the Earl to see the Weight. I was reallly dragging, not really wanting to be out. M-lo was drunk and I was not. Which is totally cool, just not as much fun for me. So he stayed and I went home. Now I have no idea where he is. Hopefully he's not STILL at the Earl.   Got a new helmet to ride on the motorcyle and for my Vespa once it's done. It's purple and pink and the cutest thing you could ever imagine. Seriously. Because I can't link things, copy and paste this: http://www.jphelmet.com/catalogue/content/f0015/f0015.html

      Yes. Two posts in like 4 minutes.   Monday I hung out with some people from my Improv class. This one particular person was being very strange with me and I don't like it but I don't feel like writing about it either.   Yesterday, J and Alison and I went to Noche for Margarittas. They are $3. $3! After two of them, i was completely out of control. I proceeded to tell Alison and Merrill (who showed up later) that I tried - and cannot - be tittie fucked, because in fact, mine are too small. But I told them it was cool because I prefer sliding the salami into the brown log. I told them this. What the hell is wrong with me. I even told Alison she should try it. Good freakin' lord. Then went with J and B and busted in on M-lo. He was making coffee naked. He went with us to ElMyr where I told B to act like he was talking to me so I could cover my face and "rest my eyes". I am so dumb.

      Went to Savannah this weekend. It was fun. Here's some things I did:  - Visited the GA Music Hall of Fame. 38 Special. Hell yeah! - Camped outside Jlo and Ben Affleck's fence (Skidaway Island), in a tent, no less. - Rode my bike around. - After pointing out the house I spent much time in as a kid, M-lo pointed out that he too had spent some time in that house. Making out w/ one of my old friends! Dude, I slept in that bed. - Drank.  - Went on a haunted pub tour and drank some more. - Went and looked at some old stuff. - Ate Krystal at 2am in the car. Woke up w/ Ketchup all over the window.  - Experienced M-lo eating crab legs for the first time at the Crab Shack. Where, I must say, they now have 78 alligators. - Took M-lo up a lighthouse for his first time. - Walked on the beach. Saw tans.  It was a good time, and I am a lucky woman to have such a good man to spend such good times with.

      A few more hours and I'm out of this place for a long weekend. M-lo and I are driving to Savannah by way of Macon. So we're gonna go to the GA Music Hall of Fame AND (get this) Krystal to try their new BA Burgers. They look like livers!! It's gonna be awesome.   We met J and B at The Local last night. Good to hang out.  J has to get up REALLY early for work, yet once she gets drinking, there's no stopping her. So around 11:30, she gets a wild hair to go to MJQ. I'm trying to disuade her, saying stuff like, "J, there's little 20 year old kids there. You have to get up for work. You are a freak." Stuff like that. So we went home. Then i call her this a.m. and she was all up in the Clermont last night, getting shots off a trucker. Nuts.

      Two more days and then a long weekend. M-lo and I are going to Savannah to go camping and hang out. We're camping on Skidaway Island which is apparently where Jlo (not to be confused with M-lo) and Ben had a house. Should be fun. Unless the cicadas have hit.   Went to dinner with Melissa last night. First we visited Daniel who seemed to be in good spirits. Then we went to Brewhouse. Kenny came and met us and told us this crazy story of his boss jumping in with sharks and having bloody feet and then getting out and claiming she was "cold." Then M-lo and I went home and hit the skins. Well, really the couch, but our skin was on it.   Christine started a blog and if I knew how to link it, I would.

      Tuesday. Going to dinner with Melissa tonight. Should be good to catch up. It's been like 17 years since we've talked.  Last night, Beach Mission 2004 went into full effect. I'm going to Coco beach w/ Merrill and his wife and need to be ready. So, I jogged w/the dog and ate some food that noone really cares to hear about, but let me assure you, it was good for me.  Then I cleaned. Then I became bored.

      Back to work after what was supposed to be a work weekend. I went to the grocery store. Does that count as work?  Besides that, i spent a lot of time hungover. Friday Mlo and I were going to play tennis but headed to Jean's pool instead. Laid out with full clothes on and drank with jean, dinese, luis and mlo. Then decided it was a much better idea to go to El Myr and drink TWO (?!) pitchers of margarittas than go to a movie as planned. Thus, hungover Saturday. Went to Jake's show at Youngblood Saturday nite, then some other something or other. Drank way too much. Ended up stealing a fake hand that was broken of so it looked all "rock on". That's the "I love you" sign in sign language.  So no work done. But who really gives a shit.

      I believe El is mad at me. I have emailed her twice to no avail.  Last night I once again waited for Mlo to get off work. He's been working late and it sucks and I'm a big baby because I want everything to be done on my time. Then we went to see Lucero. It really blows me away how long some people have been hanging out in bars. But it more so blows me away that that's all they do. Ever. They have no real friendships, just one's they cultivate once the tap starts flowing. Used to be me and i'm glad it's gone.  Today is Friday. It's a work weekend. As opposed to a play weekend.

      I haven't really felt like doing much of anything lately. Last weekend really kicked my ass, and since then I've felt not so much my self. That said:   Monday I got to hang out w/ Jean. We went on a shopping spree at Old Navy. I proceeded to stick to my claim of not buying anything over $30. Meaning clothes. I'm not getting all crazy by talking about beer or nothin'. Then we went to Ru Sans for a mucho expensive dinner and to her house to drink some wine. Well, I apparently drank sooo much wine in about 45 seconds, that by the time I got home, it was all over the bathroom floor and my wool pants. I threw them in the wash, hoping I wouldn't have to tell Mlo I yet again threw up on myself. But I told him anyway.   Last night went to my 4 y.o. nephew's birthday dinner at the Vortex. Man he's getting old. Then I went and cleaned up my house. I'm trying to make myself more motivated when at home and not just sit down and do nothing. It's been one day. This is very exciting.  See, I need to go out. I need the bug back. Hopefully thinking I'll want/desire to see Lucero tonight.

      Went to my mom's last night w/ my sister. It was nice to spend some time alone w/ my sister in the car - because when the kids are around, it's as if she goes into a zone. I guess you have to as a mother so things don't annoy the hell out of you. Things like, "mommy, why?," and, "pleeeaassssssseee." We went and checked the work my mom's done on the house then went to Outback to eat. I've never really eaten at Outback, as I don't like places that are simillar to Chili's, O'Charley's and the Olive Garden. And I don't really like meat. But it was straight. Straight and tight.   Going to Boot Camp at lunch. I'm hoping it ruins my weekend.

      I have a facination with dogs riding in cars.  I don't like them if they are in the back sea, or laying down. Just if they are in the front (passenger OR drivers) seat, looking as if THEY are driving the car.  I secretly think the whole reason I got a camera phone is so I could capture one in the act. The situation presented itself to me today on 14th St. I fumbled for my phone, but he drove off too quickly. Bummer.

      I guess it's a little too late for a weekend recap. I'll try to make it short.   Went to Athens w/ Ben and M.lo for Athfest. Saw a band, went and drank, saw another band, went and drank some more. People got really drunk. Wresting, shirts off at the ATM, jumping in bushes, swimming, no sleep, driving home. How was that? Saturday all we did was eat at Nuevo Laredo (big plans!). Sunday went to eat w/ my man's family and then to the Punchline w/ D and Ben for some comedy show. It was funny. I guess.  This week has been long. Everyone is in New York for Promax. So It's snoresville for me here. Went and saw Alison's new place yesterday night then the Charles Bukowski documentary. That guy has some sick skin (had). Gross shit. Seriously. I'm looking forward to Pride this weekend. And corndogorama.   This entry reads more like my date book. I'll try and work harder at this. REally. It's not fair to you el.

      Ended my drinking hiatus last night (4 days!). Went to Jean's and we watched Southern Comfort. It was a documentary about a tranie from Toccoa, GA. Not very sexy. I drank a bottle of champagne while we watched it. Then we went to Estoria and met up w/ B and M.lo. Nothing too exciting.   I think we are going to Athens tonight to see M.lo's old band play at AthFest. M.lo said to bring Gin for the car, so it could be a really long night. Or short, depending. I'm going to not eat for the next 9 hours so I can stuff my skinny face at the Grit.  No one's at the ol' Cartoon Net. today. I have a meeting at two then I'm gonna head. I am debating the pool or a nap. I think it's too fucking hot for the pool. I am boring myself while writing this.

      This is not Karen posting. It is the ghost of Karen. The real Karen died while taking "Boot Camp" at the gym.   Hot damn. Inside of thighs burning for the wrong reason.  So yesterday, M.lo and I babysat my nephews. Well, while I was in the toilet, Liam asked M.lo why, "Aunt Karen doesn't see her husband anymore?". The hubbie being my ex-boyfriend. It was like 8 months ago. And he wasn't my husband. How strange children are.

      So, totally forgot a story about this weekend. No it doesn't involve alcohol, making out, or even drugs for that matter.   We left Calvin's party kind of early due to the fact I barely slept the night before. So I go home and am sitting on the pot when M.lo lets my dog, Bettie, in. I look at her and notice something's wrong. Her eyes have swollen up so all they look like is tiny black dots with bubble gum (covered in spit/mucus) smushed on top of them. At this point, I start crying. Well, M.lo, being the superhero he is, puts us all in the car and we rush off to Pet's Are People Too's emergency room. Time: 12:30.  We get to PAPT and the entire parking lot is covered in gay men hooking up. Because Berkharts shares the lot. All the gay men are like, "Oh, girl, look at your dog, so cute!" Then they really look at her and are like, "OH GIRL! Look at your dog!"  Needless to say, 2 hours and $150 later we left PAPT. Bettie had been stung by something. Dog's don't get hives. They get bubblegum eyes. As we turned out of Ansley onto Piedmont, an enormous storm hit. So big we thought we were gonna have to camp out in the car. So big it blew the roof off a gas station in Kirkwood. So big I cried again.  We got home around 3.

      Monday.  Weekend was long. I am wearing myself down. I think all the toxins I put in my body coupled with my repetative lack of sleep has done much damage to me.  Friday I went to dinner w/ M.lo then over to Jeans. We drank lots of champagne. Then went out. To El Myr, Estoria, then to Paul's house, then home. I was druuuunnnnnnnkkkkk (shocker!). We went to the pool early and lasted about 4.5 seconds before it was too hot and we retired back inside to sleep the day away. Later that eves, went to C's housewarming party. Danced, drank, didn't really dance. Cleaned the house and saw Harry Potter on Sunday.  Speaking of cleaning the house, I've had an issue for a long time. I'm kind of embaressed about it. You want to know? No, I can't tell. Okay I will. You see, I can't...put up my clean laundry. It sits on my guest bed forever. I wear it, put it in the wash, then put it back on the bed. I went head-to-head with this issue yesterday - cleared off the bed. THEN, I did two loads of laundry and put it all away. Oh. My. God. This is a big day in my world. My sad little world.  Tonight we have a party at Compound (Barf-o-rama) for the relaunch of Cartoon Network. Debauchery.

      El's blog is B-O-R-I-N-G. Where is she?  Went to Screen on the Green last night w/ L. M.lo met up with me. Kind of. His friends were there, so he disappeared for pretty much the whole thing. Then we went w/ B to meet J at the local. Then to Echo to see Wil Oldham. I was so tired at this point that I couldn't keep my eyes open. I kept catching myself saying, "Karen. Eyes. Open them." Then I'd close them again. M.lo ended carrying me home around 1:30. I woke up late. No, not hungover. I barely drank. I just hate M.lo stupid alarm.  Not too sure what's going on this weekend. I have no plans tonight as M.lo is out of town. Tomorrow we're going to Calvin's housewarming. I need to get him a gift, but I'm so not fancy enough to come up w/ anything. He's not fancy, just designer-esque. I'm more Old Navy-esque.

      I already relapsed.   You see, M.lo and I decided we are only going to drink twice a week. And during that twice a week, not get all beligerant and crazy-nasty. Well, I went over to J's yesterday. We walked, we talked, we went to whole foods. Then, we drank some wine. Lots of it. I mean, it really wasn't LOTS, but it seemed like it. Enough to make me have a headache this morning. Ah well, climbing back in (the wagon).  Screen on the Green and Wil Oldham tonight. Too much to do.

      Blogger wasn't working this a.m., thus i would have posted earlier to talk about my fabulously relaxing vacation.  Here's some things I did: - RODE the whole way down (no drivin' for me sucka) - drank lots of things that include fruit juice, gin and vodka  - saw a dead turtle that had been spray painted by either hooligans or environmentalists (M.lo was very scared of said turtle - must remember this). - Drove and Drove and Drove to find Dixie Crossroads. Got lost. Peed in the brush w/ M.lo and Merrill, while Kat kept watch from the car. Drove some more in hopes of making it to D.C. before dark so we could admire all the gardens, butterfly sanctuary, and 1980s dolphin murals. - Found out Dixie Crossroads closed the above mentioned park. (http://dixiecrossroads.com) - Ate ROCK SHRIMP. Served by Eileen (at Dixie Crossroads). Merrill thought she looked like Susan Sarandon. M.lo thought a Meth-head.  - Made Kat check out the bathroom I dubbed "Sadamm Hussain's Bathroom" (sp?) because of the gold, marble and black.  - Listened to M.lo's report that SHB cost over $27,000. Thus, the men's room had not been done yet. - Boogie Boarded til the break of dawn dude. - Visited Ron Jon's. The world's LARGEST surf shop. - Ran in a rainstorm on the beach back to shelter. Giggled and laughed. - Played poolside Bingo. And trivia (we won). - Dealt patiently with some girl who came and sat w/ us at trivia insisting that purple was made by mixing blue and pink. When the guy announced that purple was made by mixing blue and red, the girl started screaming, "All right! Blue and pink! I'm right. I'm sooo good!" This was from 4 stories above the pool (where we sat). - Drank. So. Much. - Didn't burn.   Back to work. Whoever thought Cartoons could not be so much fun.

      Three things i don't like:  1. People walking across the street when the light is fucking green. 2. People. 3. Walking.

      Had fun last night at Screen on the Green.  I was unable to walk home. M.lo would hold me up, then he'd let go, and I'd start wobbling. I think he and Ben thought this was just hilarious. I did not. So I'd be like, "uhhny...peese hold meee.." Then it would start all over again.  I think we get off early today which is fabulous, seeing as how I'm going out of town in the a.m. and have tons to do.

      Saw that old friend last night and it was quite ... um, quite ... eh. No need to delve into details here because you never know who could oneday read this.   Then i went and met up w/ B, Nicole, Michael and Etel (sp?) for about 30 mins at Brewhouse. It was nice to bring myself back to reality and realize that life can be normal and not involve things one might suggest went on in trailers.  Going to Screen on the Green tonight. Although everyone bailed.

      Whew. Was a very long weekend. I am so sick of alcohol, I feel like suing it for damages. Or aggrevated assault.   Seeing a very old friend of mine tonight. We grew up across the street from each other and now she has three children. We haven't "hung out" in about 10 years, so it should be pretty interesting.   I played Tennis last night, and I was running after the ball and saw something in the woods. Well, turned out that something was a large heavyset black man with his shirt pulled over his head, resting on his shoulders. It appeared as if LHBM was touching himself. So I made M-lo play on that side. At first he couldn't see him, then he did and said, "Maybe he has a fort or something?" A fort. For real. No grown LHBM has a fort. So when we were done, I says to the tennis center guy, "Hey, you know there's a scary man in the woods." And he says, "Yeah." Um. Come again? "There's always mens up in those woods." Well it's a damn good thing my backyard backs up to THE WOODS WHERE THE LHBM CREW HANGS.

      Work is very slow this week. All the bosses are out, and well, there's nothing really to do.  Last night I really didn't feel like going to my sculpt class. I blame this mainly on the massive amounts of debauchery I partook in this weekend. So i went to Jean's. We decided to go for a power walk through downtown. It sounds gay, and it was. Best part was, when we were about 10 blocks from home, the sky opened up and took a big ass piss on us. So bad that not a single ounce of us was dry. You could see Jean's nipples, and she sang, "I like Pina Coladas, and gettin' caught in the rain..."  Once we dried off, we went to Sweet Lime for $1 sushi Mondays. It was decent. Then we met Liz and M.lo for trivia at the Brewhouse which we totally lost. We lost real bad. Below are the reasons I don't think trivia is my thing:  1. I know nothing of sports, movies, music, pop culture or sports. 2. I drink to much. 3. I forget stuff when I drink. 4. I forget how much I drank when I drink.  Anway, hoping to catch Chihuly in the garden tonight with my mom. They light it all up. Yet it looks like rain.   yawn.

      Well, well, lookie loo who hasn't posted in quite a while. It's me. Me, as in Klog Hutch.  Let's see. I had a good weekend. A crew of us went to the Stone Mountain Laser Lightshow Spectacular. It was a good time. Not as redneck as I remembered. But it's cool, I sipped on some gin & juice, sang some country. Then we went to the Clermont for some good ol' fashioned fun.   Saturday woke up tired as hell, seeing as how I slept 1.5 hours on Thursday night, then stayed out late Friday. Luckily, all we had to do was go hang out with M.lo's mom. Luckily. Oh. My. God. Mom's should not be hung out w/ while hungover. Especially when we decide to go to the most crowded place in Atlanta on a Saturday ... the Dekalb Farmer's Market. After taking 17 hours to eat, we walked around at the rate of, oh, zero. Everyone passed us with looks of agression on their faces. Then, as we walked through the isles, she asked us if we wanted her to buy us stuff. Like plums and bread and eggplants. This was not very much fun. I was not feeling so good.   Sunday, M.lo and I headed over to Allison's pool. I got some tan. Then I had a bunch of people over for a BBQ. We drank, ate lots of meat and played Farkle.  I don't like bloggin over several days because I can't talk about one thing in particular. Whatever. I just ate a fucking butterfinger.

      I went to Target last night. By the way, there's nothing I hate more than when people say Tar-jeey. Really. So I'm trying on some new work out clothes, cause you know I've been working out. Well this lady is in there yellin' and screamin' this at her kids: Get yo' ass off that floor. Get up! Why you acting like you retarded.   Um, what the hell. Children are going to be so screwed in ten years.

      So, yesterday M.lo was going to cook me dinner. Being the shining star I am, i wanted to do a little something for his effort. So, I started with shaving my legs, and the other stuff, if you get my drift. Went to my room, slipped on a teddy, started to put on some make-up. Good so far.  Well, a few minutes later, I begin itching. On my hoo-ha. I look down and I am covered in HIVES. All over my privates. Well, I rip off my teddy and walk around nude for a few moments. Things begin to get more and more uncomfortable; I am almost unable to walk. I now realize that I've had an allergic reaction to the Irish Spring soap I shaved with. All I can think about at this point is not getting some later in the evening. So, I call M.lo and ask if he's still at the grocery. He is not. So I slip on a skirt and run off to Kroger. Well, I didn't really run as I couldn't because my F-ING LABIA was swollen so much at this point I could barely move. Like my flaps were HUGE - they did justice to the name "beef curtains." Get to Kroger. Must say, hands down the worst experience I've ever had in a grocery store. It's really hard to walk normal when you've got what feels like two ten gallon water ballons sandwiched between your legs.   So I buy something named "Dayhist." It's the generic version of something or other. I figured Day meant not-drowsy. Wrong. I was asleep within a few hours.  Man, talk about a sexy night.

      Okay. I'm seriously taking the time to update this thing. It's day two back at work after the long weekend and I've been too lazy to do so.   So Friday I get a call from my mother. She says there's been a problem in Tennessee. And I scream outloud at work, "Fuck, someone in my family always dies on holiday weekends." Well, turns out it was my cousin. The cousin I just went muddin' with at my grandfathers funeral. The cousin whos double-wide just burned down. The cousin with two kids and no life insurance. The cousin who I apparently have done no justice to by screaming about people dying on holiday weekends.  Her husband was apparently "cruisin,'" which is often done in the back hills of Tennessee. He was going about 100 miles an hour (logically), drunk. She was riding in the passenger seat, no seat belt on, window down. Can you see where this is going? Well, he lost control of the car, she flew out the window, hit a building, then the car came crashing down the hill on top of her. Talk about FUCK. So they had to postpone the funeral to Monday admist talks of how long it would take to piece her back together - talks which took place in front of her nine year old daughter, no less. And be it a Big Sandy tradition, they decided to have an open casket.   Now this story may lead you to believe that I spent the weekend admist this morbit situation all weekend. Well, let me tell you I did not. And yes, I feel like shit for not-ing. I just couldn't pull myself to be there again. There being Big Sandy. There where christians do coke, and church is just another excuse to drink. There were people put air-brushed seagulls and the words 'Going Home' on coffins. There were pigs AND squirrels are eaten. I couldn't do it. I didn't do anything here.   I was home by 11 every night. Except when we went camping at Lake Lanier. Then, I was asleep by 10:30. So the weekend was uneventful, I didn't support my family, and I can't do anything about it now. I did get to spend Saturday cruising around on M.lo's motorcycle, Sunday on the lake drinking beer and seeing fireworks from a boat, and monday playing trivia with a girl I've never really hung out with that I enjoy alot (not in a gay way, although being gay is cool with me).   That's it. Just wanted to let it be know what a bad family member I am to have. Warn everyone not to add me as an in-law.

      How come I can find nothing on the death of Marlon Brando. Don't you think the news would be all over this.  Today starts summer Fridays. Too bad summer looks like winter this year. I'm not going to talk about the weather.  I did some stuff this week, but haven't really been in a mood to write. That is all.

      Shoot. Forgot something. I had to drop my nephew off from school yesterday. I drive up to my sister's house and she isn't there and i'm like crap. Well she calls right away and tells me to "LEAVE, NOW!" as someone has broken in and she thinks he's still in the house. Turns out he wasn't. He took: cel phone, DVD player, DVDs, Video Camera (w/ my nephew's video of his first crawl and walk), tools, jewelry, the weed whacker and ICE CREAM. Old ice cream, at that. My sis said same thing happened to her friend a few days ago, except the guy was still in the closet. GOD.  Worst part is, her husband is out of town for 3 more weeks. He's sailing in the middle of the ocean and she can't contact him. No, that's not the worst part. The worst part is now my older nephew is scared to death to be alone. He won't use the bathroom w/o pulling the curtain back. He won't leave her side. She's said she doesn't care that they took her stuff, but the fact that they took her son's sense of security in his home really pisses her off.   Sucks. Like she wasn't having a hard enough time just keeping up w/ the boys while her husband is gone.

      Never tell the only person that reads your blog that you have nothing to do at work. Because then you'll get slapped for not updating this stupid thing.  Tried to organize an all girls Farkle BBQ tonight but it failed. Failed because Jean invited Ben. Which i guess is cool b/c only two people were going.  Went white water rafting for the first time this weekend. Holy crap I was ScArEd. We camped out w/ 15 people in a field, drank, hot tub-ed, ate and rafted. it was fun. Then Jean had this hairbrained idea to go to Dayton, TN to see the "Monkey Museam." This was a fictional museam she had heard our river guide talking about that was about the Scopes evolution trial. So we drive an hour in the rain, and after hunting for a while, found the stupid thing and it was closed. And there were no f-ing monkeys. It wasn't even about monkies for crying outloud.  It was about some guy that didn't even teach evolution saying he did so he could put Dayton, TN on the map. What a crock.  John Tesh is on "I love the 90's - 1994." He plays one of those keytars. The electric keyboard/guitars. All the while his hair wings are flowing down the aisles of the theatre.   It is only 3:19. God save me.   Oh, yo. My birthday is Saturday. 3 parties for OTHER people's birthdays. Man people sure were fuckin' the end of 1976.
