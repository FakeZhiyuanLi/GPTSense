      Hey, I feel like its been awhile, when in all relativety, my mind is always thinking and it feels like awhile, because things come and go in my head, and by the time, i get to this very "subject" of this post, I have been through many other subjects as well.  First off,   to get it off my mind, I just saw the movie "little black book" and ending said something like, life happens most, when you are planning for something that is approaching. So stop planning and live your life now. That totally goes against my life, because I have always been the planner, because then I think that I get what I want. But what if I didnt plan, and got what I needed the most, and secretly wanted the most too. But then if you dont plan at all, you could be a loser who doesnt do anything. Conflicting thoughts. I have always told myself not to plan so much, its just that it comes so naturally to me, to plan for college, plan why someone likes me, plan how i mangage my friends, money...everything. Maybe I will start by unplanning some of those things..and letting them come to me. One small thing at a time. I suppose.   we;ll talk soon. Caitlyn

      So, I swear I meet someone everyday that is so profound, I dont think that I ever have the thoughts to equate to their greatness. I met this guy once who changed my life in 2 days of subbing for one of my classes. A free-lance actor, better yet, a free-lance thinker. I can see why people say that when you meet the right person you could run away with them and nothing would ever matter.  In the book Catch 22, they talk about running away. And they debate, that running away is bad, because your problems will eventually come back to haunt you, and the conclusion was that he wasnt running away, he was running to his problems, rather making his life more interesting with every second that he spends.  Sometimes, with all of my set "life-plans" I want to not forget, that I cant live in--what will happen in the future, but rather in this moment. I never want to be the girl who is uncontent with this moment, because I cant wait for the next moment.  Could that free-lance thinker help me run away. All i know is that, when I want a serious relationship and even think about marriage, I want to meet someone exactly like him. Who I can "run away" with, to solve my problems head on, and live in this moment.
