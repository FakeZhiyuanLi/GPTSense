      Heya I'm back now.  Today is the 2nd official day of summer break.  YIPEE!  HA ya right.  Well today I did almost ABOSLUTELY nothing.  Seriously.  I like watched TV and was on the internet all day.  I know, very sad.  It was too cloudy to go out and tan so that was out.  And now my computer is broken and right now my parents are trying to fix it.  They are in my room.  Without me.  I'm kinda scared I swear they are gonna find a note or somethin and then I'm screwed.  But hey whatever.  UMM today is the 8th?  OK yep it is.  18 DAYS UNTIL I SEE BAM MARGERA!!  I AM GONNA START COUNTING DOWN EACH DAY!  HAHAHAHAHHA!  I WILL RAPE HIM O GOD!!  LOL JK!!  Ok I'm good now.    Today I watched lord of the rings also and it was fun.  I love lord of the rings.  Shut up i'm not a geek its a good movie.  :)  And today I freaked out at my mom which just proves even more that I have a anger management problem.  AHHH ok ya and I rewrote my story and it's better now so I'm not as pissed.  YAY.  LOL jk but ya I think that is all for today.  luv yall

      Ok hi this is the first post (actually the second but I'll get to that in a minute) of a crazy lil bitch's mind.  Enjoy.  OOooooOOO I'm so pissed right now.  I already typed one post and it was LONG but I forgot to save it and my internet shut off..   AHHHHHHHHHH..... ok ya ne wayz  This was the first official day of summer break.  What did I do?  Well nothing really actually.  I suntanned, because I'm a pasty white marshmallow who needs color really bad, I attempted to skateboard, but failed miserably.  Again.  I cant' do anything on it so I got pissed and threw it on the ground and chipped it again.  Yes again.  I have anger problems so what I can't help it.  :D.  So neways and then I practiced my slapshot but got bored so I went inside and basically watched tv all day.  And of course I was on the internet too.  And now I'm pissed for two reasons.  One because I ALREADY TYPED THIS GOD DAMN THING!!  and two because I spent today writing a really cool story and I had finished one and a half chapters of it.  So my mom wanted to use my computer so I figured ok, i'll just come back to the story in a lil bit.  SHE FUCKIN DELETED MY HARD WORK!!!!!!!  GOD DAMN BITCH BURN IN HELL YOU DESTROYED MY FUCKING MASTERPIECE IT WAS REALLY GOOD AND SHE FUCKIN DELETED IT and al she had to say was "well next time you should save it".... AAAAAAAAHHHHH STUPID FUCK I HATE YOU!!!!!!!!  ok I'm a little better now.  Oh wait no I'm not.  TAMPA BAY WON THE FUCKIN STANLEY CUP.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALGARY'S.  BURN IN HELL TAMPA BAY AND YOU'LL SEE MY MOM THERE TOO.  GOD SO PISSED.   Well now I better go before I fuckin piss my pants cuz i'm so fuckin pissed right now and i'm tired.  Night night.  Yep.
