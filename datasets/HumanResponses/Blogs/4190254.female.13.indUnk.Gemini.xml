       Yeah...We finish all the 3 subjects just left Maths only...think so...I just cannot take it i study some much for history and u noe wat? Only 6 questions comje out...I wasted my time a lot on History then become like that...But luckily all 3 subjects finish already or not i will have an headache....The Geography was damn tough that Mr James Tan very wat seh...nvr teach us the stupid vegetation thingy then he go and set...We all were like Mr Tan u nvr teach how to do??..I saw a lot ppl copying but Mr Tan just ignore it..He even give us a clue on which river should we write. I admit i copy but i only copy the Rivers and Vegetation ...I swear i will copy for final year examinations.. I want it to be my own sweat so that i can make my mummy proud coz i love her a lot. When i copy i really feel very guilty i almost cry as i was thinking of her..She always say to me that dun copy if u dun noe how to do just try your best. But i dun heed her advice i really feel guilty...Mummy i am really sorry. I promise i will not copy again k? I will heed your advice and give u a better future k mummy kah love u a lot....

This is the first time i like someone that serious..I think of him every second, minute, hour and day...Just could not get him out of my head...He is just an attention attracter...  Why i like him??? He is smart, cute and intelligent...Aniways he is pretty impressing...He is presentable and who needs a boy with looks if he is not respectful and funny...I really like him...so wat can i do...???? Just wait perhaps..Wait until he gives a sign to me...

       I am just a simple girl. I an emotional first u see me smiling happily and next u see tears dropping down my eyes. I hate cliques because i believe that we live in a multi-racial country. I like to talk a lot like a 24hr radio playing non-stop. I love to read Harry Potter books cause i find them interesting. I like watching movies in 1 month i watch 12 movies.The best movie i have seen so far is Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban. Hope i can meet my idol Daniel Radcliffe.He is so handsome and charming. But i dun noe y my sista dun like him everytime i read harry potter book she will put it out off her sight..So strange....Maybe she's mad or me LAME!!!hahahaha....
