      Took a trip with Stephanie out to Arkport, NY where my mom calls her "second home". Her second home is actually an RV campground where they park their camper and have built a deck around it, basically it is like a permanent campsite... I'm sure you can imagine what I'm talking about.  So here's the big event from yesterday... Ten minutes after we get there, my mom lets us know she was in the hospital the day before and was checked in overnight for having pneumonia. Well, I was shocked to hear that (and that also explains why she was so lethargic). She's alright though, just drinking lots of fluids as the doctors have told her to. What makes me mad is that they (mom or Jim-Stepdad) never called to let me know she was in the hospital, yet folks I don't even know at the campsite knew she had been. Maybe she doesn't give a toot about me anymore.  The end.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - German Strong Baby Called a 'Normal Boy'   This is an amazing story out of Germany that could lead us on the path of developing medicines that can cure muscular distrophy. Remember the movie "Unbreakable"? Rememer when Bruce Willis was able to bench press and awesome 500+ pounds, while his ten year old son watched in utter amazment. This kid might be the first known "Unbreakable" man.

      Looking at the title of my blog you are going to call me someone in denial. Obviously I must be a fan who is unwilling to give any respect to the Pistons for their championship... Uh, yeah!  I watched the Lakers go down last night to the Pistons and then sat for about thrity seconds while the confetti streamed down and the championship hats were unveiled, Rasheed Wallace holding his baby daughter in his arms and it was all the smiles on court. I really wanted to see a closeup of the referees after the game, smirking because they had just handed the Pistons the championship, but I did not.   The Pistons should consider themselves fortunate because there is no doubt that the NBA, the refs, and ABC had a part in this championship. Top that off with Karl Malone's knee injury and Gary Payton's lack of competence and there you have it. Get real, do you really think the Pistons are that great of a team? The Lakers have four future hall of famers and the Pistons have -- Rasheed Wallace? Chauncey Billups? Please...   Take into account the non-calls that the Pistons were given throughout the series and all those points would have equaled victories for the Lakers in games 1 & 4. I should be staying up to watch game 6 tomorrow night in LA, but that now won't happen. Congratulations refs, you got your victory! The Lakers will be back, let's see if the Pistons can beat them two years in a row.

      If you are a Laker fan as I am you watched in disbelief as Detroit came out and spanked LA, again. Shaq came to play, Walton came to play, but where was Kobe, Malone, Payton and Phil Jackson?   To put things in perspective no team has ever came back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. But, then again no team has ever won all three home games in the 2-3-2 format. I predict that Detroit will lose the next game and then try to wrap it up in LA. That's a grim forecast for Los Angeles because it could easily happen. LA look slow, old and thin on the bench. Detroit is playing like NBA champs, especially in their defensive mindset.   Am I crazy to think the Lakers still have a shot at the title? Though my co-workers think so, I truly believe that if ANY team out there could come back from 3-1 to beat the Pistons it is LA. Taking into account that poor shooting has been the breakdown of the Lakers... If Kobe Bryant can come back to score some points and Karl Malone is suddenly cured we could have a series. To me, there is no doubt the Lakers will win game 5 Tuesday night in Detroit and push this thing back to LA. It's what they do after that which will ultimately decide who goes home and who gets the rings.

      I am a Laker fan.   While I watched the game last night, I noticed Phil Jackson is not very nervous about being down 2-1. Nor should he be. The reason why the Lakers have let the Pistons get ahead of them is poor offense. In games 1 and 3 they did not get the ball to Shaq enough. Watch for Shaq in the next two games, he will drive hard down the lanes and establish position early. This will cause foul trouble for the Pistons.  The Lakers will win the next two.  It's easy for people to start talking about the Lakers being "done for" because it makes good press. I am not in denial about their poor preformances in games 1 and 3. Game three will be the low point for the Lakers in this series. Getting the ball into Shaq in game 4 has to be their number one priority. We assume that by doing this, the Lakers take advantage of the mis-match at center. The low-post threat Shaq provides will free up Kobe, Fisher and Payton to score from the outside. Malone is key in the next two games, his injury is bothering him but the Lakers are much better off with him on the court because of his good decision making. The Lakers will put Bryon Russel and Rick Fox off the bench for some defensive pressure.  How the Lakers will win games 4 & 5.  Get the ball to Shaq. Get it to him often and allow the offense to run through him. Get Detroit in early foul trouble, specifically Rasheed Wallace. As we know, the fouls will limit the effectivness of their defensive abilities and because they are not a great shooting team the Lakers can take the advantage. Shaq needs to be on the free throw line at least 15 times each game. Take Richard Hamilton out of the game by having Kobe Bryant guard him 1 on 1 and this will disrupt their offense. Make Chauncy Billups win the game for Detroit.  Be agressive on defense.  Take hard fouls and get Detroit angry.  This is my take, let's see how Phil responds in the next two games. Even if we are down 3-1, don't count the Lakers out. Let's bring this thing back to L.A.

      Well sports fans, this is Monday. The weekend (as it usually does) flew by and I'm here at work. Took out the ugly, dying, insect infested shrubs in front of the house on Saturday. There was three of them in a row in the very front of the house, and now they are gone for good. The house looks very bare from the street level.  Took Stephanie to see "The Day After Tomorrow" on Sunday. A triumph for disaster movies. Dennis Quaid, who plays in the main role does a convincing job portaying a climatologist who predicts the North Atlantic currents could shift, causing catestrophic changes to the earths atmosphere. The shift, he states, could happen sometime in the next 100 - 1000 years. He was right about the shift, but the timeline was off.   We get a taste of tornados leaving all of Los Angeles in ruins, some graphic deaths of news reporters who are "live on the scene" covering the destruction and the birth of a tornado. If you've always wanted to see a TV reporter being hit with a billboard and carried away in the vortex of a tornado to his death as he is giving his live account on the ground, this is your type of movie. The setting then switches to New York. To see New York being hit by a 400 foot tidal wave and the floods that hit the city streets was realistic as you can get in movie making. During the New York tidal wave scence, a bus driver looking into his rear view mirror sees this massive wall of water coming at him. The look in his eye can tell you he knows his time is up on earth.  While Dennis Quaid tries to conjure a plan to save the world in Washington, his son is in NYC getting his own taste of the flood. Taking refuge from the disaster, he and four friends find refuge in the NY Public Library when a new calamity occurs, freezing temeratures. The climate change has caused super frigid air to penetrate the atmosphere and once it hits the earth's crust it freezes whatever it comes in contact with instantly (people, buildings, water, etc.). This is bad news for NYC for now they not only have been flooded, but frozen solid. This is where the climactic moment when Dennis Quaid's character decides he must trek to NYC to save his son. He sets off on a journey with two of his comrades destined to succeed and to reunite a son and father.  I do have some criticism. In an effort to create drama, the writers decided to pit man vs. escaped zoo animals. The drama they were looking for was there, however I feel that this could have been left out because other dramatic events were occuring at the time.   Go see "The Day After Tomorrow". Don't wait until it comes out on video because this type of movie deserves the big screen viewing enjoyment and your 7 bucks will go far.   Brian

      Looking back I knew I was shocked over her death, but I never imagined it would impact me as much as it did. On Thursday the company brought in a grievance counselor to help some of us who were still struggling to cope with her death and I went. There was ten of us in the training room and the counselor asked each of us to tell him what we knew about the accident and then went back around so we could say how we felt. I was amazed at some of the great insight a few of my employees shared with the group. One girl in particular, Ashlei, said that while at the wake the son of the deceased came to speak about his mother. The boy told the crowd that he could see how strong his dad was during this tragedy and that only made him a stronger person... This was a boy speaking, amazing.  We will all miss Michou and the great person that she was. Each one of us had a special relationship with her. I feel much better now that I have gone through this debriefing and feel that I can move on from this tragedy and hopefully learn something new about myself because of it.

      Watched the Lakers beat Minnesota last night and they are going to the Finals, again. The game was good, Kobe made some great shots (one of which it appeared he jumped and was in the air for three seconds) and Kareem Rush hit six three-pointers to seal the game. Seems like they are destined to win the NBA finals for a fourth time in five years. Can't wait to rub it into the face of all the haters.  Saw an amazing story while reading the news this morning, lady performed her own cesarean. They say she is the only known woman to have ever done so. Wow!   http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001943916_caesarean01.html
