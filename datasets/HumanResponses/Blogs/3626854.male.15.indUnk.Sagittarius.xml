      Yesterday was awesome... My first good game as a wide receiver. Six or seven catches and a touchdown. Not bad for my second game in that position. Did some bad slippin though cuz I use my soccer cleats instead of football ones, and soccer ones lack the toe spikes to make good cuts. But I dont care, right now I'm tryin to get some new soccer cleats to also use in football. Nike Mercurial Vapor FG, 7 oz. blue and white. Well, enough about that dream, they sell only to size 13, I'm size 15. Plus they $175. Well, today was pretty uneventful, had a work out at 6. (last one for the week) Then, I thought I had a receiver practice, which I didnt. Then after that my dad wanted me to go to one of my old coaches U19 boys practice to start trainin with them. Well, they dont have practice till the 14. So, that be it for now.            Au Ano'i Ai

      Haven't put anythin on here for a while, and now's as good a time as any so here goes... Its been a pretty interestin couple days. Saturday I found out that my parents are goin ta Hawaii together to celebrate their anniversay.(late by a couple months.) And my sister is stayin at my grandparents cuz she is goin ta surf camp for the week. So durin the day i'm alone and all. Friday is sweet cuz my parents leave that mornin and my sis dont get back till saturday, so the house is mine. (well almost, my grandma lives here but stays in her room all the time.) Well, sunday, I talked ta the sexy lifeguard, and some... emotions were expressed. And I must say I liked the direction of these. I haven't heard from her, and I'm hopin it wasnt Just My Imagination.  We'll see, and my parents havent really said anythin about my report card, so I'm hopin they see that I am actin more responsible already and will teach me to drive. We see wont we. Well, that be it for now... Except for some Temptations Just My Imagination Each day through my window I watch her as  she passes by. I say to myself, "Your such a lucky guy." To have a girl like her, is truly a dream come true. Out of all the fellas in the world she belongs to you... But it was just my imagination, runnin away with me...       Kuku Na A'u

      I cant even think of a title for this one cuz of what i'm feelin right now. these feelings are all becuz of somethin called a report card which is just a piece of paper with a couple letters on it that can decide your whole future. mine had 2 A's and 4 B's. one more B than last report card. I'll be honest, i was surprised. i thought that i had done better than that. well, these 6 letters upset my parents, so they had to make me more upset and angry than they were so they would feel ok. i received a 35 minute lecture that actually made me cry... i know its kinda weird havin a guy admittin he cried, but right now i dont really care what you think. as a result of these 6 letters, i dont get to drive... i dont even get to learn. i dont even know what kind of restrictions i'll get when school year comes, but i can get a good idea: no goin out wit friends, no talkin ta friends on internet or telephone durin week.... anythin they can think of they'll probably do, all because of grades that a lot of parents would be proud of. but it wasnt the letter that my parents really cared about. (they said this about 5 times in the lecture) what they cared about was my work ethic. they said that i could have gotten the A's, but i didnt work at it so i didnt. they said that if i had gotten those same grades, but had been strugglin and studyin every night and havin them check hw and that whole deal, that they woulda been happy. but i didnt, so now i'm punished by havin one of the few things i been lookin forward to this summer not givin to me. see ya when i see ya...

      Well, I haven't had a new post for a while so I figured nows as good a time as any so here goes... Father's Day was okay, we didnt really do anythin special, my dad's choice. Yesterday I was planning to get up to go lift weights at 6:00 am, but when I woke up at 5, I fell back asleep til 6:30, so that didnt happen. I just went to the one at 5:00 pm. It was then that I found out that I have a 7on7 game thursday against Agoura or somethin and I havent caught anything for like 2 weeks cuz of soccer... so this may not turn out well... I checked out the pool yesterday, and I guess my eyes go bad out there cuz I still didnt see the "sexylifeguard". I checked towers and everything... Anyone know where they go when they aint out there? I didnt get ta search long cuz the otha guys in the towers were checkin me out or somethin, so I got outa there kinda quick. Tomorrow I gotta soccer practice at the indoor place, and I'm pretty pumped about the whole soccer thing, football is takin a backseat to soccer for a while. This saturday I got 2 or 3 games! Crazy shit goin on... After my little performance last saturday, I wonder what my coach is gonna do... Oh well, what happens happens.                Ake A'u Pomaika'i

      Today I had my first two varsity soccer games, and I must say that I am sure I can handle this @#$%. My first game went down okay, I was nervous sort of subconciously so my touch was off, but better than Thursday. We tied Fairfax 1-1. The second game was a bit different, I didnt start and I didnt get put in until the last 5 minutes of first half, but I was on. Touch was close ta perfect, made good runs, I even got ta crack a shot off that was just wide of the left V. I was right midfielder. Then it was halftime and I was expectin the coach to start me that half after my little performance... but no. I was sort of mad, but my first game sucked, so I guess it was justified. Anyway, second half starts and about 3 minutes in there are two injuries on our team. I go in as right midfielder again and damn I did good, both defensively and offensively. It was 1-0 when I went in. As time went by the game got rough. The other team was pretty desperate. We got another one so it was 2-0. Then finally our weaker keeper messed up. They shot a long floater and he misread it and came out. When I saw him come out I tried to shout for him to get back, but I guess he didnt hear me. He went out and it went over his head and into the goal. Then after about 15 minutes the play got heated. Guys were flyin everywhere, fallin, slidin, our center back nearly started brawlin with the other teams big shooter. Finally we got a goal off of a corner kick. Not by me, but I think I get a little credit, I was distractin the keeper a bit by gettin in his line of sight and pushin him a bit. But they came right back and scored off a ball that our keeper blocked but should have caught, and the run up man came and scored. But we remained calm and came out with a 3-2 victory. Now we have a good chance of goin on and playin next weekend. Thats it for now...                   Lanakila He No Kaua

      Today started off ok, take my sis ta camp, hang around watchin and stuff, jokin around with a few coaches, practicin my ball skills. Then I go home, eat, just wait around til two. I leave at two for a little scrimmage the varsity team has against the better of the incoming freshman. I had to be there around 2:40, but I left early to stop by the pool and say aloha to someone... but they werent there! It was 2:15. Were they fired already or somethin cuz I heard they was supposed ta be there... oh well. Anyways, I'm warmin up and I'm shootin a little bit and hittin the ball well. The game's about to start and so I get to my position and I'm feelin pretty pumped and ready... damnit I was playin pisspoor. The first couple touches I got were ok, but then it just got bad... wasnt gettin inta position fast enough, wasnt crossin properly, just bad touch. I guess I my positioning was due to the fact that it was a new formation for everyone and I was in a somewhat difficult position. But there really is no excuse. I get subbed out (thank God) and I sit for the rest of the half. (I thank God cuz ifI carried on how I was the worst could happen.) Anyways, second half comes and we go to oldschool formation and I was in a position I knew how to play and do play. Wow, poor has a new meaning. I was divin in instead of containing, wasnt in the proper position in different situations, wasnt supportin the midfielders, nothin. I managed to get in a few ok touches and a couple ok passes, but in a 70 minute game if thats all I can get... thats bad. But I'm lookin forward to this weekend, got two games saturday and I know I'll be better prepared. This post had a lotta soccer lingo in it, so I appologize to those who do not play the great sport, and hope that they make better decisions in the future than the one where they chose not to play soccer.

      Well, today started off pretty normal. I took my sis ta soccer camp, then decided to go check out some lifeguards and see do CPR, this is around 9:00. But no, there was not a guard ta be seen. Deeply disappointed(just playin), I went back to the camp and helped out a little. Next year's froshsoph team is gonna suck. There were about 5 guys out there outta 35 or 40 who could play decently. Then I stunned everyone with my amazing keeper skills.(yeah right) But I did okay for not playing keeper for about 2 years. After I had schooled everybody, I went home and just hung out, rode my bike, not doin anythin in particular, when I see my neighbor hangin with her friend. I didnt really care, so I kept on doin whatever it was I was doin. Then I heard some really loud laughing, I mean there were echoes after it. So I look over and see both of them checkin me out... oh yeah... not really. When they saw I had noticed them they went into their garage, but didnt close the door. So I dont pay attention and keep shootin hoops. Then I look over and see one of their heads pokin out of the driveway lookin at me. Yep, I still got it. ;) For anyone who really cares, nothin happend. My neighbor yelled for me to comeover, so I did and I just talked ta both of them for about half and hour...

      Well, today I went to a soccer camp that I didn't even have to go to, only cuz i didnt know. Yeah, since i'm varsity soccer i dont have to go to this camp, or, i wouldnt if it werent for the fact that my sister is going to the girl camp and i have to ride over with her. what a fun week, take my sister to Royal, go do whatever, go back to Royal and get my sister... all before noon. And its not like i'm driving and picking her up, i'm biking and so is she, but my parents dont want her biking alone cuz somethin could happen... anyways, after i found out i didnt have ta go to the camp, i had to go to a weightlifting session with football. this is when i find out that my sports career next year will be even more stressful. i'm goin ta be playing both wide receiver and defensive end, so that means twice as many plays and formations to remember, twice as many techniques, twice as many responsiblities... seems like everyday a new weight is added to the bar. hey, at least i'll be in shape. yeah, well after that i went home then went on another biking excursion. i went over to this place Elephant Rock, kind of a good place to go if u need quiet to think... and i had stuff ta think bout. not goin to discuss on this though, still not keen on the idea of pouring my soul onto the internet...

      Well, I'm into this blog thing... kinda weird. Everyone and anyone can just look into what i'm writin and there nothin i can do bout it... how fun, not. o well, guess i should write somethin interestin. (ha, my life interestin) anyway, today, full on yard work all day: mow lawn, weed, plant, everything while my dad pretended ta do some work... parents suck. and what's really sad is that the highlight of my day was when i got to take a ride in my car. (i wasnt even drivin it) jeez, sometimes life sucks. worst part about it is it's and ugly little car: 88 honda civic gold bomb. can u picture that? then imagine that your grandma has had that for the past 16 years and has been smoking in it. where's Pimp My Ride when ya need them. o well, still got a while before i drive it. well, its been summer for 3 days and i'm already thinkin bout next year. wow, next year's gonna be crazy. as of right now, i'll be starting wide receiver for the JV football team, be on the varsity soccer team, and be taking 2 AP classes, 1 Honors class, and 1 CP class. stressful? oh yeah, major. oh well, what happens happens and nothin u can do about it. well, thats it for today, i know not very interestin, but cut some slack, first post for me...

       Wow, I'm terrible at this blog thing.... haven't posted for a week. Been very boring past couple days, now that my football practices have ended. Now I'm feelin bad cuz my friend just went to Florida for water polo and I didnt get ta say bye or good luck or nothin. This was caused by my mom hidin my yearbook somewhere and my sister havin my cell at her UCLA soccer camp. Oh well.... we see what happens. Anyway, my mom said somethin that kinda scared me the other day.... well actually, she asked it. She asked, "Why aren't you more social?"... That one caught me by surprise.&nbsp; I didn't know how to answer, cuz I havent found an answer to that already. I have ideas why, but they probably just excuses. And it's weird, cuz I still don't really have an answer to that... But anyways, it's a constant boredom for me cuz I got no practices and no license. So I won't be postin again til somethin actually happens... which might be a while, lol. Well, I dont have much else ta say...&nbsp;umm.... how about some Hawaiian words of wisdom...

      Today we were supposed ta turn in all the money we made selling these little discount cards for football. Really retarded shit, but it's for the love of the game... So I decided to sell them by having my mom take them to her office and try and sell a few. She ended up just buying 4 to sell later. So I take that money and the remaining cards back to the coaches and then some really stupid crap goes down. They tell us they're gonna give us 10 more to go and sell and to be back at school by 7:00. Here's my question, if you weren't able to sell all ten in your neighborhood the first time, what made them think the second time will bring in the money? I went home and went swimming, then my mom came home and I told what was goin on and asked her that exact question... she didn't like it. So she made me go out and actually try to sell some. Of course, me be the crafty person I am, just bought one or two myself and went for a walk. True salesman at heart. I didn't sell one to anyone but myself or my family. Now, last time I posted I said I was a wiseman, and I am, so I'm gonna tell another story. It's actually a dialogue explaining what is wrong with today's youth... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Leaving For Paris  "You know, maybe you should get on that plane. I mean, after this, all we have is the summer. Then I'll go off to college and we'll share phone calls and spend the occasional weekend together, and that's nice. But chances are, one of these days I'm going to get so wrecked that I'll have unprotected sex with some girl in my dorm room. You'll find her thong and call me a slut, then I'll get mad and call you a bitch, and we'll break up. So when you think about it, what's the point?" "Oh Jake, you obviously stole that line from Karate Kid or something. (No, I...) Shhhh, it's okay Jake, I love you too."  'Oia'i'o Hoa pa'ani

       Well... havent done a post in a while so I figure good a time as any is now. Nothin much been goin on lately, havent even talked ta anyone really... Didnt do too much this weekend, had to go to a carwash Royal soccer is doin to raise money, then sunday went to my sister's soccer game... yep, fun never stops haha. Man... I was hopin this summer was gonna be awesome, but now I'm realizing the bitter truth... summer sucks. No trips, not much hangin out(always room for change tho), no summer romance(again, room for change)... oh well, been gettin some time ta think ta myself without any distractions... been pretty cool... been readin some too, hard to believe. But I am happy my brain has just slowly dried up and disintegrated. I feel like a wise man compared to some of my friends because of this... and as everyone knows, wise men tell stories... so, I have a story, its like a parable.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an old man, around 80, who made beautiful furniture. One of these pieces was an extravagant dresser. There was a woman who came along who saw it and instantly loved it. The problem was that she had just moved into the town and was very short on money. The dresser was easily worth thousands of dollars, but the woman could not stop herself. She asked the old man, "How much is this dresser?" Then he replied by asking, "How much do you have?" The woman said, "Not enough." "But that is for me to decide isn't it?" replied the old man. The woman looked to her savings and said, "About $300" The old man raised an eyebrow and said, "Only three hundred?" She looked again and said, "I have three hundred and two dollars and 33 cents." The old man smiling&nbsp;said, "Ah, well that is a different matter... I could not possibly let this piece go for a mere three hundred, but for three hundred and two and 33 hundredths, it is yours." She blinked at him. "You serious?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." She paused for a few moments and said, "It's worth a lot more." And he replied," I could take it into the city and get four thousand from a rich buyer, five if I wanted to haggle." She didn't understand, "If you can get five thousand for it, why in the hell would you sell it for three hundred?" "Three oh two point three three," he said. "Do you have money in any other account?" It was a rude question, but she was intrigued. "Well, no." Then he said, "Then if you give me that money, how will you eat?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, scrounge somehow or sell something I own," she replied. "You would skip meals to own this dresser?" he asked. "Yeah, look at it. It's beautiful." she said. Then he said,"A fat rich man in the city could give thousands for this dresser, but that would only be a tiny bit of his fortune. But you are willing to give all the money you have to own this. Surely you see that this is a measure of real value? I saw your face when you saw this dresser, and that was the reason&nbsp;I make such things. Money is nothing, I have more than I can spend. Your face reflects what I put into making this dresser. You will care for it, cherish it, enjoy it, is this not so?" "You bet," she replied. "You and I, we have just made love, and this chunk of wood is the conduit of that energy. Such things are priceless. Money? Pah! When you look at this dresser, you will sometimes think of the crazy old man named Moyo with the smelly pipe and you will smile. And perhaps you will pass it on to your children and tell the story of Moyo, and so on and so on. And even though I am dead and dust, in a way, I will still live. An artist wishes his work to be appreciated. If you walk away now you would still be the true owner of this piece, it was made for you. But I will take your money and you will take my creation and we will both be richer for it, no?"

      Well, someone was right... i have been dwelling too much. Just a phase i guess.. passed it, and now i gotta get out and do somethin. In fact i am, like a week or two and i'm goin ta six flags or hurricane harbor with a friend or two and possibly this chick he's goin out with and maybe some of her friends... wink wink. Nah, not lookin for any action from them, been lookin elsewhere for a little bit... I wanna thank the person who made me realize that i do have a good life and i should pay more attention to what i have, so thank you. Well anyways, the last six days since my last post have been pretty uneventful... strained a muscle in my back, but other than that, nothin much. I start practice with the Simi Valley Eclipse under 19 team this week. Thats gonna be kinda interesting... make ready a body bag, lol. Nah, i'll be able to hold my own, i'm probably still gonna be one of the bigger guys out there, just not as good. lol. Then tuesday i got a passing league game at Royal at 4. I'm pretty nervous cuz i dunno if my back is goin to be okay by then.... well, what happens happens. anyway, enough of my schedule... been tryin not to think as much and just focus on whatever i'm doin, but its harder than i thought... the monkey brain just keeps goin. if you dont get that metaphor, dont try to figure it out, or you'll get the monkey brain. well, that all i can think ta put on this right now, wasnt great... but what is? Ahonui Po'e Loa'o Mea Laua Pono e  Oh, this song got the monkey brain goin a little... i think we all feel this way at least once in our life... TREND...  Frickin A Woke up today  looking through my email  it's all triple x - explicit sex  But I'm not horny   Can't make it stop, the different colored soda pops  striped toe socks, call the cops  I can't take anymore   I've got the perfect cel plan with nights and weekends free  All the ringtones that I need  But no one ever calls me   I should paint myself green  Walk around in a red g-string  Cause I just don't fit in  Turn my hat sideways  put a band aid on my face  You know that I....  Wish I could start a trend   Checkin' out and in of the Paris Hilton  Joe Millionaire - he's a has been Flippin' through a hundred million channels  But I still watch Road Rules  Lose the pounds FLIP  You gotta buy now FLIP  Here's the number to save your soul FLIP  Breaking news...another Michael Jackson scandal   I've got the perfect cel plan with nights and weekends free  More on-peak than I need  But no one ever calls me   I'll wear low rider jeans  Put a barbell through my dingaling  Cause I just don't fit in  Turn my hat sideways  put a band aid on my pretty face  Cause I wish, I know, I could....  I would start a trend   Nana nana na  Nana nana na  Nana nana na   Then there's my girlfriend  She's such a cutie  She'd be a beauty  If she could get an extreme makeover on that booty  I could bend her over and she let me spank it  Take off my jeans  The zipper pinched my dingaling  And I don't really fit in  Throw my hat away  Take that stupid band aid off my face  And I...I wish there were  One more way to tan your skin  a reality show where no one wins  If I would be myself  Then I would start a trend   If I'd just be myself

      5 days since my last post... and i still have nothin really interestin to put on here. wow, what a charmed life i lead. man thats a laugh... well, today is 4th of July, independance day... where are the aliens? wouldnt be too bad for me if they did come... today, as i was talkin to a friend, i realized how unsatisfied i actually am... and it kinda scares me... i need to get out of here, out of this house, this neighborhood, this town, this state, this country, this continent... start over somewhere new. hawaii could work since we're in the process of buying a condo there. great ocean view, or so my parents say. they're there by the way, left together and ditched me and my sis so we could take care of my grandma who's nearly blind... but anyways, i wish i could get out of here... there's nothin really for me here. lived here for three fourths of my life, and yet i dont have a whole lot of great memories. i mean, there been fun times, and day to day life isnt bad... but i've never really done anything here that i'll remember for the rest of my life. but isnt that supposed to happen in highschool? arent these supposed to be your best years? if these are, then i'm not optimistic about my future life... anyone readin this probably thinks i'm a depressed psychopath, haha... be funny to see their reactions if they heard that i'm probably one of the smartest kids in my year, i'm startin JV football and Varsity soccer, have lots of friends, and potentially a great future... probably freak people out. and its not like my home life is bad either... my parents did fight for a while back a few years ago and lived in different places, but not no more... isnt that usually the excuse people use? "oh my parents are divorced, thats why i robbed the 7-11" and i feel bad that i went thru a little... whats a good word... revelation i guess, about how i'm not really happy with my life while talkin to one of my friends. sorry about that, hope the fireworks were good, saw some from my hill and they made me think of ya... anyways, my friend told me that good things happen ta people with patience... well, whatever happens i hope is good, cuz i been pretty patient for a few years... i know what good things could happen though: girlfriend who really cares for me, friends who do anythin for me if i need them to, my parents respect and approval of what i do... more love i guess is the main focus of it... cuz that is what everyone really strives for. everyone wants to be loved, the problem is that some people get more love from others... well, problem isnt a good word. oh well, no one can really do anything about that, love is one thing you cant control... man... but dont u wish u could control love, like, u could make someone love you... i dont really know, i think everyone wishes that at one time or another. but then, its not really love if you make someone love you, is it? wow, i just answered my own question. lol, my friend first started doin this, and i was like,"so your gonna pour your heart out for the world to read? i'll never do that."and here i am, basically pourin out all my deeper thoughts that i doubt anyone knew i had... before my friend really did. and speakin of my friend, there been some weird stuff goin on between us... its hard to tell whats been goin on, at first i told her i liked her, but she didnt feel same for me... and that was cool, wasnt really expectin her to feel same... then later, it seems like she does like me, and she's basically sayin it, and i was pretty happy... then lately, it seems like not so much anymore... why does this have to be so con-fuckin-fusing?!?! all these weird signs and i cant read... ok, that was a bad joke. but i am confused, and it scares me... usually i'm confusin the other person. well, i think thats enough pouring for one night... been doin it for half and hour... wow, seems like only 5 minutes...

      Wow... been a long time since i posted last. Good reason tho, nothin really happen lately lol. I know i said i wouldnt be postin til somethin happend, well, i lied. Anyways, umm... went ta the movies wit some friends friday night, didnt even see anythin, we just hung out around there and went ta Lemon park for a bit a lit up a few firecrackers.... pretty harmless stuff right? Anyways, later this junior chick and her friend pull up in some white bug and ask me if i wanna go ta the villiage... (know her from geometry... helped her out during the final ;)" and i was like "hey... maybe i should" but i was too afraid. (jk) nah, it was just to late to start a movie... like 9:00ish... so i just stuck with the guys. but now that i'm thinkin about it, maybe i shoulda gone... ;). but anyways, me and some of them were talkin bout goin ta Hurrican Harbor the next day... but in the end no go. oh well, nothin happen that day or the next... whole family was out in Irvine for my sister's soccer tournament. then they made it to the finals so i got to wake up at 5:15 this morning to leave about 4 hours before we actually had to be at the field cuz, "we might have hit traffic". we lost. it was hot as hell... actually, it was only like 95, but then the field was still kinda moist so it was a humid heat and f#$%$# disgusting. so when i got home, and didnt feel like workin out, i just didnt go... i felt like such a rebel, even tho it was my first intentional missed practice. lol. yeah, so here i am, at 7:40, feeling like i'm gonna fall asleep right here, without even doin anything. oh man i'm pleased with myself..... (said sarcastically) well, i'm gonna go get in my jacuzzi... Au Ua He Nani Kane!
