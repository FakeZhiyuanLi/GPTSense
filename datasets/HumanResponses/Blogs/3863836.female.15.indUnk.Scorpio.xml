      Did you know that joy was a choice?  A man said to a beggar one day, "Good day, my friend." The beggar answered, "Well thank you, but I've never had a bad one." He said, "Well may God give you a happy life." And the beggar replied, "I thank God that I am never unhappy." The man was speechless. And the beggar continued, "When I have plenty to eat, I thank God. When I am hungry, I thank God. If it is God's will for me to endure this, then whatever is God's will for me." He chose to be happy.  I got this from something DeeAnne sent me. (Thank You) I just thought I might share this with all of you. Have fun!

      I have changed my email adress from  urlLink volleyballchic_072002@yahoo.com  to  urlLink jesus_freak172007@yahoo.com  . I thought it would be more fitting to my new lifestyle I am trying to accomplish for myself. Instead of putting myself and my sports first I am putting Jesus Christ first.I accept him as my Saviour & I hope that all of you who visit my site either those who are my fellow&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;get more inspiration &amp; those who aren't become a fellow Christian real soon. Hopefully my site makes you think and leads you in the right direction.

      Why do we try to get people's approval? Why can't they accept the way we are?  How do we get everyone to approve?  Is it better to have approval or disapproval? Is it possible to get everyone to approve?

      I always had some sort of religion in my backround. Not very strong, but it was still there. My parents thought it was good enough, so why change anything. I went to several churches in Aurora & Paw Paw, when I was littler. Around 9 or 10 my parents stopped taking me to church.  When I was 11 my mom & dad got a divorce. I think the reason why it hurt me more than I thought it would is because a week before they announced it, I asked my mom if they were getting a divorce & she said "NO! NEVER!" That's when I relied on my bestfriend & neighbor Cassi. Even though she was three years older I still went to her for everything. She was like a big sister to me.  My mom continued to live with us for a while. Then my dad caught wind that she was dating a different guy. Then we moved out with my grandma & grandpa.  For a while I didn't get to see my mom or my bestfriend. It hurt me a lot. That is when my grandmother became a very important part of my life.  In the sixth grade I started going to church with my grandma & got baptized. I was going through the steps to becoming a Christian but I really didn't feel like I was with God at all. It felt like he was in my body and my mind. But not my heart or soul.  On September 11th we moved back into my old house & I became close with Cassi & my mother again. Then later that year we moved back out with my grandparents. Through all of this I continued going to church & going through the "motions" but still not feeling anything.  I didn't want to continue to live with my grandparents or my dad so January 2003 is when I starting living back in town with my mother. Just a few short months after that Cassi moved to Streator & to this day I still don't keep in contact with her. That's about the time my grandmother went in for her knee replacement surgery. Her health went downhill from there.  That year I was making horrible decisions & suffered from their consequences. I still went to church on Sunday's an confirmation class on Wednesdays. One day my mom told me I better shape up or I am going back to living with my grandparents. So one day I just prayed to God that I wanted to change & I didn't want to be in trouble anymore. God dug me out of a hole so deep that nobody could get out with out the Lord as their Saviour.  In June 2003 my grandma went into a coma. A day later she came out. Despite the doctor's preminitions she did recover. They figured that was when she'd pass. That is when I started to believe the power of prayer. Everything was fine with her for a while & there wa shope she'd be coming hope.  Then I soon asked Jeremy if I could go to youth group with him & obviously he said yes. I am really glad he let me go. It made me have better weeks & made god number one my life for a while.  November 13th 2003 at 10:00 am was my grandma's death. I was in choir class getting ready for a field trip & my mom called & said that I couldn't go. She didn't have to tell me she died. I just knew. I turned 15 on the 17th & shared my birthday with her funeral. It was an emotional day. It was mixed with laughing & lots of crying. I wouldn't have traded it for the world though. Then & I still do think that my birthday will bring a burden on the family for all years to come.  I looked to my new bestfriend Ambyr & Coleen to talk to when I got down. I continued to come to youth group. Weeks at a time I would feel that I wasn't being too godly & I didn't deserve God. Then some weeks I would feel on top of the world.  Then when Ambyr got in a fight with our youth group leader everything went downhill from there. She didn't want to come to youth group. One of the people I thought I could count on the most definetly proved me wrong & went to jail. I still can't believe it.  Ambyr moved to Alabama and that hurts me so much. She was the first one to come & talk to me when I first started coming to youth group. I guess you could say I lost what I thought was my life but I gained a new thing that will become my life. GOD!

      Don't you ever feel one second something is right but the next it suddenly isn't?  It's like making fun of somebody. It's fun when you are telling another person but when they find out you suddenly regret it.  Its like smoking pot. Its fun at the moment but when it screws up your life you fell like the dumbest person alive.   Its like stealing. You just want to have it but when you get caught you suddenly don't want it anymore.  Its like breaking up with someone. At the time they get on your nerves but afterwards you feel like such a jerk.

      If you think about it, this question is one that even the smartest people can't explain.  What did we ever do so right to make Him love us? What did we ever do so great to Him? What didn't we do wrong?  I think every single human being on this whole Earth has rejected or denied God at one point in there life. I know if I was rejected or denied like that I would hate everyone. I know a lot of other people would, too. What makes us so great that its so easy to love? He has the power to condemn each and everyone of us to hell. Why doesn't he?  Just a few things to think about & people who may have an idea to the answers to my questions, I would really like to know what you think.

      Aug 9th - Aug 15th   Revelation 21:6-7 And he said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha & Omega, the beginning &amp; the end. To the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life without payment. He who conquers shall have this heritage & I will be his God &amp; he shall be my son.  Think About It This Way: God always was &amp; always will be. He will help anybody with nothing in return. He is the king of all. If you believe you are His son.

      Rob not the poor (being tempted by his helplessness), niether opress the afflicted at the gate (where the city court is held); For the Lord will plead their cause, & deprive of life those who deprive the poor &amp; the afflicted.

      And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tounges; they will pick up serpents, & if they drink any deadly thing it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, &amp; they will recover.

      Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer & petition with THANKSGIVING, present your requests to God. And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts &amp; your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lonely, whatever is admirable - if anything is excellent of praiseworthy - think about such things.

      The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him, He hears their cry &amp; He saves them.
