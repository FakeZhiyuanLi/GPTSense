       It all started good when I went home and carried out my routine of cooking and serving for him. I felt tired after my daily routine and he wanted me to go to the court with him for a game, I declined and stayed home to surf the web. Baby came back from his exercise and took a shower,I was still on the computer or rather his computer. He started to snap at me, commenting why didn't I use the computer when he is out and now that he is back, I have to return the computer back to him, cause he has proclaimed that its his.  Well he paid for it, rightfully is his, but I cant help feeling angry.  I have been working for 1 year now and been paying for our expenses and rental,and he has been at home playing games, relaxing for a year now, cant I use the computer even though is his computer?  Where is the justice?  I was being served by justice when I shouted at him and my hair was being pulled by him and dragged into the room. I had a bump on my forehead and slight abrasion on the wrist.  I cried and cried and cried. I want to go home where my mum and dad is, I am in such delimena.  Why do I marry such a man that I have not felt happy with? I was so in love with him but has this love been taken granted for? Is my love for this man still sustantianable for me to stay on by his side and love him unconditionally?  I asked myself, does he really love me ?

      I came to realise that writting can be another way to destress beside smoking.  There are increasingly people writing on the internet, no more primitive 'dear dairy'. How very interesting, but what happen to our little secrets that we want to keep that no one except for my dear dairy hidden under the pillow knows........ but I think this is fun too, letting others into your little world and share your woes and happiness with whoever is reading this.... why not !! :P  Is another Monday at work and I am getting sicked of this designation: Arm Chair Manager... I am not seeking out for more sales , neither am I associating with those Chinese speaking colleagues anymore. I am sick of this shit hole in the Whoop Whoop Tuas... got to break free from the hands of the fat boss who comes in masquerading in her rugged, baggy, unstyled clothes.  It is total uncooled!!!!!!
