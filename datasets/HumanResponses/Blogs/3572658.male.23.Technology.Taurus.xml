      Why do I always have to be thinking about whats next. Last week I had been working in the "real world" for less than two weeks, and I had already thought of what I might do next. Don't get me wrong, I don't think its bad to think about the future and try to plan accordingly, but sometimes I wonder that me thinking about what''s next is just me not being content in what the Lord has given to me. Or maybe it me just anxious for new challenges or maybe its me wanting God's best for me and not settleing for second best. Maybe its good maybe its bad, I dunno...as long as I follow that still small voice of the Holy Spirit inside of me, sometimes its just so hard to hear Him :| -->

       urlLink Origin of the 21-Gun Salute   During the week of Reagan's funeral and memorial services, I thought to myself: "Self, I wonder why we do a 21-gun salute?." So I "googled" it (that may be a whole 'nother post one day!) and this is what I found.   Enjoy!

      Ok, so maybe being an Architect isn't quite the best idea for me to get into now, maybe four years ago, but not now. My reasons are that I would possibly be in school for 5 more years, then I would have to do like a two year internship, then probably a two year apprenticeship, then if I am lucky I would get in with a really neat firm and maybe in a three or four years then I could design some really impressive buildings! So if I started that now, at 23, maybe by the time I am 35 I could do what I really wanted to do with architecture!   Realistically tho, Andrew and I are thinking about starting our own business(es)! More later maybe sooner!

       urlLink School of Architecture-Louisiana State University   I have been thinking about this lately (like the last day or so). Of course I have always liked architecture and I love the idea of designing and creating things. I think I am crazy, but I want to go back to school for architecture. Because I have just accepted this job, I think I will stay here and try it out. But the more I think about architecture and designing structures, the more I get excited about it.   Then I also thought about going to live in Hong Kong , and I have or trying  to go work for the FBI somewhere, or also going to live in someother cool city in the US, I think I just want to go live somewhere else for a while. I may end up back in BR, I may not. But I could go back to school for architecture but it doesn't have to be at LSU.  I dunno what Im gonna do. I just dont want to take life sitting down, and more importantly I want what God wants for my life. I am still trying to figure out what that it is! (If you know any details, let me in on 'em!)

      Well I started my first day at Appro Systems today. It was good. Its definitely not the most exciting job in the world, I think once I get the swing of things, I will really start to enjoy it more. But it will be good for me to gain a little work experience and make a little money. I always thought that as soon as I start working I would just find the perfect job making 6 figures and love what I was doing. Well, maybe that will be the case in my second job!  Tomorrow I am looking forward to organizing my desk and the hundreds of emails that I automatically get from ASP Mail. This morning I had over two thousand emails! First time I had even turned on my computer and I have over 2000 emails! I read every single one, just joking. I did look at most of them tho, but it didn't take very long because approx. 90% of them were one liners containing between 40-50 characters a piece. I set up some filters so most email organizes itself when it comes in.  I also have some online training to do. I think I will do that in the morning and then organize my space in the afternoon. I can't forget to make my lunch in the morning.  We had Youth Leadership tonight and Levie gave me the new Pine Cove CD, I haven't really got a chance to do it yet, but thanks to Sydney Berry the case looks really cool! We also sign big huge cards to Courtney and Christian. Today is Christian's B-day, HAPPY BIRTHDAY C-Train!!!

      I wonder if this place is legit. It seems almost too good to be true. However, it does make sense that it would be cheaper  because their is less material, i.e. no boxes or manuals. As long as you order is 200 dollars or more they include free shipping, I would imagine that if you order is less than 200 bucks shipping is outrageously expensive.     http://softparadise.net/index.php?s=7305    urlLink

      Today someone called the support line at my job, they were looking for a free reading. I think she said she tried to dial 1-866-myastrek. Our number is similar.  I just got a good laugh out of it...a free reading?!! LOL  Speaking of free readers, if psychics really do exist, then why don't you hear more about them like winning the lottery or something?
