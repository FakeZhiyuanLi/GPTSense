      Well this morning I managed, finally, to get to church. And oh how my soul was longing for it!!! I felt so ggreta walking into the church and the worship part of the service was amazing. I even managed to drag along the guy that I'm seeing to church today. He enjoyed it, which was so great for me to be able to bring him to experience it. He is used to attending Catholic services, so this Pentecostal service was somthing very different than what he was used to. This guy is so fantastic, but I feel so awful because I really can't decide how I feel about him. One minute I like him a lot, one minute I am completely turned off. He treats me amazingly, however seems a little too into my body and less into me. I personally don't feel I have the greatest body, but he just loves it. I know some would feel it was a compliment, but for me it's almost creepy. I'll catch him staring at me, and not just looking, but staring. It's kind of weird. He thanks me for kissing him, like I'm doing him a favour or something. Some weird things about him is that he does wear women's deoderant. He says it's because if his mom is going to the store, it's just easiest, I can't see how hard it would be to get men's but whatever. And his t-shirts are pretty short. I know all this seems really shallow, but it's just these little things. There are a few other things he's said to me that question how compatible we really are. No matter whether I break it off now or later, he will be hurt, but I'm just so confused as to what to feel. Like I said, there are some things, like him being able to come to church with me, that I like so much in him. I feel comfortable with him, for the most part. Hmm....I don't know.

      Ok so I just wrote a nice long posting about why I am as messed up as I am. And poof gone thanks to the wonderful world of page expiration times. I am too drained to try and type it all again. I know you're all excited, but I'll try again tomorrow. But just as a forwarning, I am a mess. Completely a mess. I think I need to see a shrink. Soon. hehehe I'm so lost.  * Good night *

        Well, this is my first official bog posting. Let me exaplin a little about why I've decided to start this online journal. Or at least, that is how I look at it.     Anytime I feel the need to express myself or put my thoughts into words I usually just write and allow my hand to be guided by my words, throughout the page. I haven't been too consistant in doing it over the past few years because I've had special people in my life, friends and more, to share my thoughts and troubles with. But as I continue on my journey of life I realize that there are very few out there that I can truely trust, and have come close to realizing that I am pretty much alone. It has been a hard realization for me, incredibly tough, and you'll see through my postings the confusion and troubles I have had with this whole new realization of what my life has become. I am also hoping that through this, it will help me to get my life a little more organized. You'd be surprised what a little scribbling can do for one's life.
