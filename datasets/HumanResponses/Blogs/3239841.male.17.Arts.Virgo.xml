      I look back on my life, through some of the good and bad, and I realize just how much of an effect my parents have had on my life.  Some of it was good, but a lot of it was bad.  My parents have been very restrictive in respects to me from the beginning.  I was only allowed to associate with people they approved of, for example.  I could only listen to their music.  I could only believe what they wanted me to believe.  Looking now, they control every single aspect of my life, no exceptions.  What I eat, what I wear, what I listen to, must all meet their approval or somehow be smuggled past their notice.  My friends they control as much as they can, although, thankfully, it is much harder at my age to control who I meet and befriend.  It has only been what, a month or maybe a month and a half, that they've let me buy my own music.  I still can't wear half the stuff I would.  It's "satanic" and evil, or some such nonsense.  The point of this post isn't to rant, though, its to say that this control, of which you have a small tast of in the above description, has really destroyed my life, and prevented me from rebuilding it.  My parents have always had a sort of negative aura or somethign around them.  They were never people I felt comfortable around, they had something more than just that parential air about them that said that something was wrong.  I've never been able to place it, but it exists to this day.  So, it is difficult to tell them how I feel.  Not that it makes any difference.  They are stubborn and close-minded, and are very slow to accept things that are in their favour, let alone something that challenges their preconceived notions.  Thus it's been a hard fight to even get them to allow me to listen to things such as metal which they have labelled as "evil."  This really held me back from forming my own ideas of the world I think, because it really stopped me from having my own feelings, I always had to feel someone else's emotion, how someone else wanted me to feel.  After all, when someone is trying to control what you listen to or see, really what they are doing is controlling (or trying to control) what you think.  I never could introduce Reena to my family, as much as I longed to, because my parents think goths are similarly "evil" and that wouldn't fly.  At best I'd've been barred from seeing her again, at worse they would have gotten into a huge argument.  So that relationship had to be kept hidden - for FOUR YEARS - not an easy cross to bear, and I've slipped a couple times, but they didn't pick up.  At least, they haven't given me any indication that they had picked up on that relationship.  The clothing issue is really a sticking point too, because clothes are something I value as a self-expression.  I wanted to go in all black to the prom - cause that's my style - I didn't even ask for any of the multitude of weird and wonderful things people have: spikes, chains, studs, whatever - just all balck.  Of course, you can guess the answer.  I can't or couldn't be me.  It was the helplessness I felt not being able to be myself that contributed the my depression, the same one that led to my suicide attempt.  Furthermore, not only do they enfore these rules strictly, but there is no dialogue to be had about them.  They are there, and if you question them there is hell to pay (I know, I've tried more than once.)  When I haven't been allowed to be me, how will I know where to go when I'm building my life back up from scratcfh as I am from now?  How can I know if that direction is true to me?

      This is just something I was talking with Jessica over, and I need to get off my chest.  Psycho-analyze away, but it helps me to talk and it helps me to feel that I don't have to keep something as a deep dark secret.  Jessica and I were talking about what our biggers "what ifs" were, and this is what I said:   Leading up to that day I wasn't feeling great at all, I mean physically too, not mentally, but my parents didn't help, you could go up to them with a bicycle halfway up you ass and they'd still send you to school... my marks weren't very good either, despite me getting tons of extra help from my friends... I had just failed two big tests in math and I knew my final mark was going to be crap.   And around then some of my friends were really cutting into each other and I tried to step in a be a peacemaker, but then it just ended up getting them all ganging up on me...   So I was feeling pretty crappy, and on top of all of that Reena and I had been fighting so I was pretty volatile around then,..   The thing that set me off was this huge fight I had with my parents the night before, they're going on and on with me cause I complained about my brother and sister saying shit about me and that backfired big time cause then my family ganged up on me ...   So it really felt like everyone was against me and I had my back against my wall, I was physically and emotionally exahausted, so I took the cleaver from over the refrigerator that night and I took it to my arm.   Two and half hours later (that's how long I went at it), I was lying on my bed with my blood all around me and my head spinning from the loss of blood, and like I said, all I was thinking about before I went unconscious was "God damn, god damn ... Reena" and then I slipped into unconsciousness...   It was sort fo surreal when I was unconscious because it was like I was aware of something, but not something in this world, it was like I was im limbo or something, idn. I felt like I was suffocating like I was being crushed before I went unconscious, but after I felt just like, empty.   I don't know, but when I woke up that morning it was a scramble to cover up all the blood on the sheets, because my parent's would have finished the job if they saw the blood.   I don't know, all I can think of in retrospect, is "what if I had? how would it have made reena feel?" God damn, it would have hurt her so very much...    To move forward, I think i really have to take a look at my past and look at it long and hard, to see what I've done wrong.  A lot of my past has remained my evil in a closet, something I didn't want to touch and something I didn't want to remember.  But how can I learn the lesson I am to learn from my past if I don't reflect?  I still don't know what I was supposed to learn from my suicide attempt though...  I was reflecting back on it, and these lyrics fit the mood and feel of that memory well, I think:   'Scuze me while I tend to how I feel These things return to me that still seem real  Now deservingly this easy chair But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair  Don't want your aid But the first I've make For years can't hold or feel No, I'm not all me So please excuse me While I tend to how I feel  But now the dreams and waking screams That ever last the night So build the wall, behind the crawl And hide until it's light So can you hear your babies cryin' now?  Still the window burns Time so slowly turns And someone there is sighing Keepers of the flames Do ya hear your names? Can't you hear your babies crying?  But now the dreams and waking screams That ever last the night So build the wall, behind the crawl And hide until it's light So can you hear your babies cryin' now?  Mama they try and break me  - Hero of the Day, by Metallica

      I have to admit, I'm not very good at this relationships thing.   Maybe that's why I haven't had maybe.  I'm in a bit of a conondrum.  You see, there is a woman I know and talk with a lot, by the name of Jenna.  To be honest, I think I love her, though I haven't felt much of that, so I dunno.  I've been trying to find the strength to tell her how I feel about her.  But there are things complicating the whole thing.  You see, she is already in a relationship with someone else, whom I think is an okay guy from the the one time I met him, and she has seemed happy with him, so I've been holding back.  I've been worried about destroying that relationship, because I know it would hurt her, and that's the last thing I want to do to her.  Recently though, she has seemed less happy with him, and I don't know.  I tend to be a sensitive person and can pick up on emotion, but she is a bit of an enigma to me.  (I suppose that's one of the things that attracts me to her.)  A part of me wants to wait and see how that pans out, but another part of me seems to have this sense of urgency, like if I don't tell her soon, something will happen.  It's confusing.  I don't know if I can find the strength to tell her how I feel, but then how else do I?  It does not help things that I'm a shy person, and find it hard to talk to people period, forget telling people, even one I trust as much as her, something so close to the heart.  But at the same time, I feel as if I owe it to her to tell her how I feel.  She was so much of a help in getting past the pain of Erin's death, and she was my shoulder to cry on through the reception after the funeral.  She has been one of the few people that has been there to talk to.  She is a kind and compassionate person.  I don't know, relationships are confusuing.  *sigh*  Here's one for you Jenna:    So close no matter how far, couldn't be much more from the heart. Forever trusting who we are, and nothing else matters.  Never opened myself this way, life is ours, we live it our way. All these words I don't just say, and nothing else matters.  Trust I seek, and I find in you. Every day for us something new. Open mind for a different view, and nothing else matters.  - Nothing Else Matters, by Metallica

      America and Canada really have become the fast food nation.  Forget Christianity, forget Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism - we have a new religion, and that is food.  We place such importance on our food, that I am somewhat surprised that we haven't officially elevated food to the status of a diety. (pun quite intended)  We have people who can barely raise enough money to feed themselves, forget their starving family of five, and yet it is more important that YOU get your food.  This is the prevalent selfishness of our society.  It has become a case of the rich and the well-off, the upper-classes and the middle-classes (which clearly exist), against the poor.  As if the poor aren't downtrodden enough.  We place our this food above our own happiness sometimes, in a way that many Christians (which is the only religion I am qualified to speak for) place the word of their God above that of their own desires and wants.  Soon, obesity will be one of the greatest killers in America - just as bad as nicotiene or cancer.  That really says something for our culture I think.  Does it surprise you to know that the bigwigs at McDonald's refer to their constantly returning users as 'heavy users'?  As if they were drug addicts?  And if fast food was considered a drug, how many hopeless addicts would we have?  I'd hazard to guess that we would have a lot.  At least half of the population.  The TRUE problem with fast food isn't it's health factor, it isn't even how much we eat.  IT IS THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO GET FAST FOOD.  We can just walk into a restraunt, point, say we want the number #5 meal (or somesuch) and *bang*, there you go, you have your meal.  You didn't have to raise the cow you're eating.  You didn't have to shoot it and kill it.  You didn't have to slaughter it.  You didn't have to cook it.  You didn't even have to put the condiments on the hamburger.  You just said what you wanted and you got it.  Don't mistake me for a vegetarian - I'm far from - but it seems to me that our greatest strength, that ease, is also our greaetest weakness.  Because it is so easy, we are literally gouging ourselves to death.    Am I the only one that sees something wrong with that?

      Together the band and I got together and made what was for us a hard descision.  Faced with our John's travel demands, and Reena's sickness, we have decided that we're not going to be playing the tour or doing the circuit anymore.  I guess you can call that a break-up.  This wasn't an easy decision for any of us to make, but with the turmoil of the past year, and so many personal problems and sicknesses to deal with, it is best for us, emotionally and physically, to just quit while we are ahead.  We will be releasing our album Soulpath, as we have been planning to, and then I think we will just go our seperate ways.  I have a confession to make, though.  It was I who first put the idea on the table.  I have had a hard time coping lately, just with life.  There is no one thing that I can really pin it on.  I just haven't been doing what God wants me to do.  I've realized that.  I think I knew this before, I just was being a stubborn cuss and didn't want to admit it.  There were a few things that really spoke to me that I haven't been doing this as I should be.  The first was a letter I got, concerning Erin.  This is the part of it that really spoke to me:   If you wonder why none of erin's real friends haven't gone and made a  huge website for her, its because we all have real memories of her, which live in our hearts and only need to be in our hearts, not broadcasted. Erin's brother wrote a song for her, because he was her BROTHER, and it would really be innpropriate for anyone with a lesser relationship with her to do so. This is all justso completely too innapropriate to express completely. I can honestly understand how you would be touched by her, because so many people were truly inspired by  her, but it is definitely crossing the line when you approach her family and friends with anything more then your sincere condolences and a few kind words.   It really did hit home.  The tone of the whole thing was a bit negative, but I needed dressing-down.  (If that's the proper expression to use.)  I have to admit, I liked the song idea, and it was a good idea, but this person brought up a good point.  I am finding it hard to find the right word & feelingss to put down, so I think that it is best that I just stop and not do so.  If I am unable to put it together with the wholeness and sincerity that I know her family and Erin would want, then it is best I don't.  I do really appreciate the work and how people have come together to help me do that, but I think it is best that I don't, both for me, emotionally, and for her family.  This kinda leads on to what I think is the real heart of the matter, though.  You can call me crazy for saying this, but I sat down and folded my hands and talked to God today, and it really helped me to discover a lot about myself.  I have to admit, I have been doing a lot of what I do for Erin because I feel the previous things I've done weren't good enough.  I felt as if I was not doing enough.  Somehow, I felt as if I was failing her.  Now, I've realized that in doing what I've done for her up till now - the pictures I made, volunteering at the fundraiser, all of that - she has smiled upon.  She is content with that.  I wanted to give more, because I felt like it wasn't enough, yet, I know now that it was indeed enough.  I worried so much about me, whether I was doing good enough, that I forgot who I was doing it for - her.  To admit that hurts me, but it is the truth.  I have tried to be her, to carry her message of hope and happiness, yet I have realized that it is HER message, not mine.  I feel like such a fool that I could take her message and make it mine.  In a way I suppose that I wanted to be as loved as she was, but now I know that I am fine as I am.  That's the most important realization anyone can make, I think.  I have lived my life trying to be someone else, I think.  Trying to live up to other people's expectations, trying to live up to other people's beliefs and ideals.  I have lived my life giving it to others, so much so that I am just learning to make that life mine, and to take time out for me, to give to me too.  I have to make my own message.  I have to be myself.  That's what she wants for me, I think.  That's what I'm going to do.   The second thing that made me realize some of what was wrong in my life has just been my discussions with other people, with Jessica, with Donna, with Katherine, and with the people at school.  I really, seriously, think I have been living backwards.  I've been giving so much of myself and not keeping any of it for me.  The writer of the email I quoted above thought I was seeking attention.  Perhaps I am.  I don't know.  It's hard at this point in my life to really look at yourself and say you know all that's going on inside, because you really don't have the wisdom to see that.   I asked Jessica to do something last night that I have never asked anyone before and I wouldn't usually think of asking someone to do for me.  I asked her to pray for me.  Jessica says she doesn't have strong faith, but I think she really must, because I am 100% sure it is that prayer of hers helped me to come to this realization of myself.  I think I have finally come to terms with myself.  I think I can finally let go of this pain inside, and embrace life.  And I've longed for that my entire life.  I don't know what it means to you, Jessica, but I thank you with every ounce of my soul.  If one prayer like that can do for me all that I think it has, then I really need to learn to reach out to people more.  As Omni wisely noted, I've been trying to help people for so long, I guess I didn't know how to ask for help.  I'm no one to pass judgement, but, Jessica, you pray for yourself tonight, and you ask for help, because that was what I needed, and I got that from you, and from God.   The final piece to my self-realization was a much more pointed one, and a much more painful one, but it really did make me go back and look.  When I went over to Reena's today and told her these things, and showed her that email, she looked at me with a sort of odd smile, and she told me that perhaps that the time had come that I put her behind to.  That hurt me, but I understood after she explained things to me.  She told me that for a long time now she's been in our relationship for me, to support me, but she said now I'm able to walk for myself, to go on for myself, that we should move on.  She said that such is what she was here to do, and now that it's done, it was time for us to move on.  I will always remember her, and Erin, for being a crutch for this emotional cripple through this trying time in my life, but Reena was right - I have a new time in my life ahead of me, and it is time for me to move forward and embrace that life.    I don't know what the future holds for me, but there's only one way to find out.

      Just as life seems up for the people around me, it falls apart again.  Such has always been the cycle of my life, and as such I suppose should not I be the sensitive person I like to think that I am, then I would be used to this.  Even as I am it has jaded me and left my cynical, yet still I must have hope ... and it hurts every time that this hope lets me down.  Every time I die, indeed.  As you can likely imagine, I am writing now because that has happened again. :(  Today reading Omni's blog, I found out some very sad news, and that's an understatement - but words to describe those things have always been elusive to me.  Her grandmother was given from 2 weeks to 2 months to live.  I don't know the circumstances, but regardless, it's a devestating thing, an utterly destroying thing.  You can read what Omni had to say  urlLink here .  I don't mean to demean this by talking of me, but I'll share with you what has helped Reena and I through our losses, in the hopes that it may help you, Omni.  When one loses a family member - any family member it is hard - but what you always have to keep in mind is that your loved one is in a better place - heaven, nirvana, whatever you may call it - and they would want you to remember the good times, to remember the strong points - the positive - rather than the negative.  That's what I finally came to the realization with as I grieved for Erin.  I did her a great disservice by being so sad for her, because she always looked to the light at the end of the tunnel, and never the darkness in the tunnel, where I was the opposite.  I was living backwards, and finally I'm crawling my way to something better after amking that realization.  Omni, you have always been a source for strength when i've been down, so, if you need it, let me repay that kindness and try to be a strength for you through what will be a trying time.    And, as Erin -  Pray Until Something Happens (PUSH)  I know I will, for you, Omni.

      You know, I would never wish half of what has happened to me in the past on anyone, ANYONE, but, when some of the shit I've been through starts happening to one of the most remarkable people I know, someone who has helped me through a lot of the pain I've had to bear, then it really cuts deep.  My good friend, Jessica, is going through some of that now, it seems.  I don't know how much she would want me to say, so I'll keep it breif:  Jessica has a friend, and it seems she has a real love/hate relationship with this friend, though I'm not one to judge.  She has said somethings behind Jessica's back in the past, but other than that she has been a good friend.  But now it seems that she has decided to do this more and more, in a way that is destroying Jessica.  When I heard about it, it cut me deep, because it sounds almost exactly what Megdalena did to me, when we broke up.  She went behind my back and told a whole bunch of lies and half-truths, and worse than that a whole lot of things I had trusted with her as secret, and it tore me asunder, and burned what remained to ashes.  On one hand, I wanted to kiss and make up, and on the other, I wanted to give her a slow and very painful death.  I know what you're going through Jessica, and I know how much it hurts.  Just find the courage to stand up to her, and to YOURSELF.  The past is a painful thing and I am sure she will open the wounds of the past, but you have to overcome that... God, Jessica, don't do what I do and let that person destroy you without fighting back.    You'll have my prayers, Jessica.

      I'm thinking those thoughs again, god dman this all, thinking about cutting again.  Jessica, if you are out there and reading this, hold me, I need it.  I hope I can keep my promise ...  Damn it, why do my parents have to be the way they are, don't they see it's destroying me?  Your forum's down, you're not on AIM, I feel so cut off from my one sense of happiness...  [update]: I did get on aim to talk with Kat though which helped my flagging spirits ... she's such a kind woman ...

      It's not easy for me to say how I feel, I suppose I'm always afraid I'll be shut down or that they'll take it the wrong way, God knows everytime I try to tell my parents how I feel it never works out, but id, I feel I can say that stuff to Jessica, it's just, idn, it's still hard to find the words...   I owe it to her to say what I feel will, so I will.  Excuse the incoherence, but my thoughts tensd to be that way, and it's taken from a seires of message board posts between us.  I think it would be real cool to meet you, idn, I think we do share something, we have connected, idn, just don't know what that bond is, hmm... how deep it is, idn. It's hard for me to connect to people I think, so it's kinda  remarkable, idn... but either way you're a real kind person, and I could use one or two of those in my life...  Jessica, you really are a sweet person, and anyone who says otherwise is horribly mistaken...  Idn, I kinda think that it would be cool to meet you in person, Jessica, because it would make it seem that bit more real to me, if you know what I mean...   Trying not to come off too stupidly saying that...   Idn, it's kinda awkward to say, but I think I knida might like you... I'll avoid the other word ... but idn it's so hard to put a finger on my emotins cause I've been so emotionaless for 4 years of my life ... but idn, I think that's what it is ...  Like Jenna I guess I have to say how I fell for better or for worse...     I don't know, it's just I've only had one person I've truly connected with before in my life, that being Reena, and now she's gone ... and I find that similar connection with Jessica.  I don't know, I mean we know so much about each other, yet so little, we need that time to mature.  The one thing I hope though, and I think I do foresee some sort of relationship - the thing is I dunno what kind - but the thing I hope is that maybe it can go deeper that the one Reena and I had, a different level, I suppose.  Reena in a way was me testing my feet in the minefeild that is personal relationships, and I think I care enough for you Jessica that I'd be willing to take those next steps with you.  If I haven't come off as a weird insane person or stalker type by now I'll be very surprised... *sigh*

      Okay, I was talking about this with Jessica the other night, and I guess I should share this experience with people, maybe as an example, maybe as a moral.  Just something to learn from, when you're dealing with people.  I probably won't say as much here as I did to Jess, but you can get the jist of it I think.  First of all, I suppose I should say who Hannah is.  She was a (pretty much) life-long of Reena's, that I met a while into my relationship with Reena.  She was always kind, gentle, and caring, but she was horribly shy.  She was into some of the same music I was, that's the one thread we all shared, and through that I began to know her and relate to her, though it was difficult to reach through that shell of hers.  When I did though we really got to know each other, it wasn't a boyfriend/girfriend thing, but she did have a certain afection for me.  She thought it was really cool that I'm with a metal band and came to all of our shows (that she could).  She looked up to me as a role model, I think.  But she picked up a very bad bit of me, and it affected the rest of her life.  She knew of the one time I had cut myself and though I never did anything that I thought would encourage it, she picked that up from me.  She did it to herself much worse than I did, though.  She cut herself right to the bone, and ended up in the hospital.  Afterwards they took her away for her to get "help", though she came back even more scarred, physically and mentally.  That devestated her, and it really devestated me, because whether I meant to or not, whether I meant for that to happen or not, I had a card to play in that outcome, and the card I played was a very negative one.  The thing I learned from this, the hard way, was that when you are a part of the community or in the spotlight as I was for her, you have to be very careful about what you portray to people, you have to be conscious of that and how it may affect people, for as I learned, people can pick up negative things.  Just remember that they can pick up equally strong positive things if that's what you put your heart into showing to the world, that part of you.  Hannah and I do have a happy ending of sorts though - she's gotten over that as much as she can, and more importantly, on Tuesday she came right out and said she had forgiven me, and moreso, herself.  Now she's become what I HAD wanted for her - that same gentle, kind, and compassionate person, minus the shyness that was a barrier for her to show that to the world.  And perhaps it could be said that she gained a new insight into my own soul, going through that, and to the many others like me, and she can help them how they need to be helped.

      God, and I thought yesterday was hell, but just when you think it cannot  get any worse, not only can it, but it often does.  It was worse even than the first time, the one that got me into this emotional mess to begin with.  I don't know, I hadn't thought I was into cutting recently, but tonight it was a battle, even when every ounce of my soul was poised against cutting myself.  I'm feeling better now, big thanks going to you Jessica, I really wouldn't have made it through tonight if not for you, I really wouldn't've have.  I can't repay what you've given me, for holding on, but just know that if for nothing else, for that you have my undying gratitude.  I don't mean to hurt you saying this, but I do love you, and it shows that you care too, I don't know how much, that you stuck with me, even when you wanted to go to bed, even with your bad news, even with how crappy you felt.  Thanks.  A lot.  Because of you, I held on.

      This question is asked by many people to me.  Some of these people know that I too have struggled with cutting, others had no clue, but it's got me thinking: what  really  got me cutting?  First of all, at least the first time, it is a reaction to a person's environment.  Humans are not born with natural self-destructive urges, at least, not in that way.  For me, it was a combination of a horrible school social environment compounded by an even more poisonous home environment.  I could not, and still cannot, be myself, and I was suffocating.  Cutting myself was a power thing me - it was a way of taking control.  A lot of the mindset was if they were not going to let me, then I will take control once and for all, and rid them of a life they liked to toy with so much.  That hate-bred sentiment hasn't left me at all, but I deal with it differently now.  After the first time, however, for the repeat cutters it becomes a self-destructive cycle.  It becomes a mental addiction of sorts.  It's the same with money or guns, and other things that give you power.  What do you want to do when you first find something that gives you power?  You use it as much as you can, naturally.  It is a difficult urge to try to supress.  I know that all to well.  So then what about beaking that cycle, supressing that urge?  I've written about a few of the lesser times I've thought of killing myself here.  I've never written about some of the harder times.  There have been some real dark ones, perhaps as dark as my first one, lately, but now there's something, someone, there to stop me from crossing that line - Lynn.  She's my hand to hold and she is slowly helping overcome that.  That's the one thing that can break the cycle - love.  And I finally found it.

      Yeah, I have a splitting headache right now... and there's a hell of a reason for it.  Long version: was asked by Sparky to take out the trash in the back room so I got all the stuff together, went out to the enclosure where the dumpster is and opened it in, threw in the stuff and took out the cart for the cardboard, went back, asked if anyone needed help cause the cardboard was goona be a while (lots of empty boxes), and they said, naa, just finish packing stuff up so I did, took it back and unloaded the cart. Put the cart away and went to go get the door for the enclosure and the wind caught it so I had about 400 pounds of door in my face. 7 stitches and many X-Rays later, I'm back home.  Short version: Door comes swinging towards me. Face vrs door. Door won.  The final battle wound tally    - 1 deep laceration (cut) above left eye, 7 stitches -> doctor wanted to put more in, I didn't let him. - Abrasions (scrapes) on right arm (lots, ow ow ow), left leg (not so bad) and my side (kinda hurts but only if I hit it). - Possibly broken nose, but XRays didn't come up with anything so I think that's okay. - And one bloodsoaked uniform.  My sister was on the shift after me and was telling me a few things when she got back home.  She was in the manager's office and he had stuck a big note on the bulliten board for the other managers there... "PETER'S NOT DOING BACK ROOM ANY MORE"  She was also telling me near the end of her shift they were looking for someone to do the back room cleanup ... for some reason there were no volunteers.  And apparently Sparky who had sent me out to do that was real concerned. I don't know he cared ... heh.  My parents caught the logs of my chatting, though they didn't read through them much ... but my dad took MSN and AIM off my computer piece by piece (sigh) They're also fairly angry with me (like that makes my pain-filled day pleasant) but I'm pissed at them, cause I'm the ONLY one of my friends whose parents wont let them chat at all.  And he also limited MY OWN ACCOUNT ON MY OWN COMPUTER so I can't install ANYTHING.  (sigh)  Excuse me while I try not to hurt myself...   I'm kind of depressed Lynn (Jessie) isn't on, she has an odd way of making me happy even when I'm hurting like I am, inside and out.

      I've broken away enough from my own cycle of suicide attempts that I think I can look back on it now, and I can think a little more clearly than before, so here's my thoughts...  First of all, to anyone who would judge me because I tried to kill myself, or to those that would tell me it's not worth it, remember that you havent been through the hell that has been my past, and you would never know how I felt, or the entirety of what I lived through.  For me suicide was a release, but not just from life. It was a release from all the bitterness, all the anger, all the hate, and all the pain I have felt. I am not a person who is very happy in myself, and when I see those qualities in myself, and see how much it has hurt those around me, I really, genuinely want to die.  The first cut was that, it was me feeling incredibly down on myself. The day before was the day I first found out my ex had a drug problem, and that shook me to the core, and that day school and the home were both hellish, so that evening I took a knife to my arm, my wrist, and cut to the bone. I was surprised with how pale I was that my parents didnt notice ... but then again I think they knew whatd happened and just wanted to deny it.  The second and third cuts were in similar circumstances ... when I found out Maya too had done drugs, and again when I learned Hannah had piced up cutting from me ... the third being a bit hypocritical, I know.  However after that, the fourth time and after, it became catering to a mental addiction, and it's a very poisonous and self-destructive cycle to try to pull one's self out of. I was at the point where only the help of another could, and I am eternally grateful and loving to Lynn for that.     Hope, in the face of our human distress, helps us to understand the turbulence inside  - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Dream Theater
