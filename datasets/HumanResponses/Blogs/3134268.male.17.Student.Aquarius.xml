       My sleeping habit is way off. I'm falling asleep at 7 AM and waking up at 4 PM. Last night I fell asleep at 10 PM, I woke up today at 3:30 AM, and now, at 1 PM am thoroughly tired. I want to take a nap, which will keep me up all night again.  *sigh*  How am I going to get into a good sleeping habit in time for school?

       Yeah, I wrote this post, and it got deleted, so this is the half-hearted re-write.  The title, "The Great Escape", is most famous as the name of a World War 2 movie made in 1963 which depicts several American soldiers trying to escape from a German P.O.W. (Prisoner of War) camp. My choice as that for the title is nothing but pure and unrelenting cynicism and irony.  For school is nothing but a prison that we as small children learn to hate, and everyone becomes cynical in their own right, as the quicker students become apathetic, and the slower students become frustrated, and sometimes, both become both, and then where are we?  We spend all of our childhood waiting to get out, to escape, to graduate, and when we finally do, we find that we are no longer children, and that we have lost the best 13 years of our life to the monolithic tyrrant which we are obligated to.  So why write a blog about it? Or rather, what exactly is this blog about?  It's about several things. It's about me, who will go through the interesting process of attempting to make up about two full credits in one year, while maintaining a full work and school schedule. It's about my school, which is one of the weirdest and finest schools I have ever set foot in, without social heirarchy and without any unifying force. It's about education, which has been lost in this country, or at least in this state, to politics and bias, and to the plastic money trench of beaurocracy where pimps and thieves run rampant, and good men die like dogs. It's about being a senior, which entitles you to feel superior and inferior at the same time, and to all sorts of unique experiences which no other kind of student has. It's about living a normal life, with all it's normal quirks and weird turns that you didn't see coming, but are so obvious now that they've happened.  It's a year in the life of me, and fortunately for you, its what will argueably be the most interesting year of my life. The craziness and that simplicity of real life is amazing, and that's what I'm keeping track of. I'll try and entertain you a little bit, maybe I'll even do something weird just so I can write about it, maybe I'll omit certain aspects, I don't know. All I know is that the toast always lands butter side down, and that this is going to be a very long year.  In the end, I made this blog for no one but myself, however, if you want to come along for the ride, buckle up, because it'll be a bumpy one.

       So, yesterday I went with my sister to something called A12. It's sort of like a student leadership thing at my church. Anyways, there are two services. One is with the Junior High kids, where we lead small groups with them, and the other is highschool, where its all student led.  They were setting up for worship for the second service, (which lasts about 15 minutes), when we realize: no one has put together a sermon for it. Zach, the head pastor for now, looks at me and Ben and tells us to put one together while they are doing worship.  So I put together a sermon on the book of Romans, specifically chapters 1-3, and I spent an hour or so giving a sermon which I prepared in five minutes. I'm kinda proud of myself...  Anyways, it shouldn't be too long until Brian and Pastor Dan are back.
