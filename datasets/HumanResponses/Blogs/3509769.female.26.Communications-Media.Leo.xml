      Argh! Everything's sooo crap.  So I have been feeling pretty depressed about the whole no sex thing. I thought when we moved house things might be better. I was hopeful. It wasn't the most romantic place on earth. But nothing, not a nibble, let alone a bite. So I keep bringing it up, y'know every day, at least once. Cos I am soo pissed off about it, it is so unfair, why, why, why? And I don't know what to do, so I think maybe if I just keep talking I'll find the right thing to say that will fix it all, my problems(or his) will be over and I'll be in happy land again.  But it doesn't work. He gets upset and angry. Ignores me or agrees to try and then nothing changes. I feel like shit. Now, not only do I feel totally unattractive but I feel like a nagging bitch too. I'm desperate, not for sex, but for the reassurance that everything's ok and normal, cos it's just not right now.  And I love him so much. And I can't imagine life without him.   But he does stuff that I hate, cos it's not only no sex. He looks up porn and internet dating sites too. God when I write this he seems totally awful, which he's not. And it really hurts me, I'm not good enough. But in real life it's "no you are good enough I love you" and blah. Because they're words, but where are the actions?  So we just move din together and we've got a six months lease but I've realised it's never gonna change and I have to leave him. But I don't want to, cos I love cuddles and talking and tickles and laughing. But it hurts too much. So I don't know what to do. I guess I don't have much choice but to stay here for now cos of the lease and stuff...  I told him, he was sad, but didn't say much. See, I don't even know, he lies there seeming all sad but in my head I'm going "maybe he's glad". So I don't know.  I feel really useless.   He won't do anything, he won't go see anyone, I can't think of anything else to do and have no guts left to try and risk rejection.  I said maybe we could find a way around it. Doing other things, romantic things that don't involve sex, it seemed like a good end to a discussion, end ing on a happy note. But I don't think it'll satisfy me, it might make me feel more loved. I do, sometimes I do.  Oh the irony, I had a 5 year sexual relationship with someone with no love and lots of abuse and all I wanted was love. Now I've got love and no sex. Must be karma, what can I do?  It seems I have to choose between love or sex but it's not really so clear cut because the love is tainted now. With my paranoia and self loathing and irritation at the unfairness of it all.   GOddamn I want to scream my lungs out!

      Yay!  Today is my first day of no working at childcare!  Amazingly G called me and asked me to work. I had to say no even though I felt guilty. It was my first day! I am happy and feel quite relaxed even though I don't really know what I'm gonna do with myself all day. I guess thats a good thing.
