      For those of you who do not know I am getting married on September 18 2004, in Las Vegas, NV.  I will be moving to San Antonio a couple of weeks before that where my fiancée, Rosie Bidana works for Pape-Dawson Engineering firm.  Right now there is not much going on in my life, except for the wedding and work, but I am looking forward to getting married and living with this truly incredible woman.  I am working on customizing a 1966 Volkswagen Beetle.  I will have pictures of the before and after once I get it finished.

      Today all I will be discussing is my thoughts.  I will be the first to admit that my thoughts are not going to be remembered in history, but I think they are important.  There are a couple of things that were discussed at my job this week that are truly interesting to me.  First of al I have a co-worker that thinks that the DWI laws are too harsh and should not be in existence.  Be fore you MADD members explode, I happened to disagree.  However he does bring to the table a few good points.   For my thoughts today I will use his examples of him self.  No, to my knowledge he has not had a DWI but states that he had a friend put into a coma for two weeks by a drunk driver.  First of all, other that the DWI law, you are punishing someone for a crime they have not committed yet, this being vehicular manslaughter, or some other more or less traffic offence.  In Texas this can, but usually does not, result in a lengthy jail time.  This would probably mean the loss of his job and in his words the end of his career.  Also since he can not do anything else he would be stuck on the street pan-handling for money.  I do think this is a slight exaggeration, but illustrates a good point.  Next, in Texas he would be heavily fined, keeping (as an example) he has no prior offences and only had a couple of beers after work.  The court cots alone are $300-$500, and if you are lucky enough to get probation, the probations fees are anywhere from $50-$100 dollars a month.  The fine is $2000 (probated to $250), and now as of 9-1-2003, you will be charged $1000 a year for up to 3 years to keep your drivers license.  Of course if you have a lawyer tack on another $1000 there.  Now my co-worker has no family, but if he did they would be taking money out of there pockets and food out of his kids mouth, all along he did not hurt anybody, and the only law he broke was driving after having a couple of beers after work.  With that said I still believe in the DWI laws.  They are there to make people realize they can kill someone and that they are not invincible.  I would like to see the first time offence punishment lessened for the above reasons, but I think the second time or greater offence should be increased.  I think that the first time is good enough for a wake up call and that the common person will just stop drinking and driving, but if you still continue to do this, then there is really no hope for that person and they truly have a drinking problem.    GET A DESIGNATED DRIVER MORON.

      Well it is less than 2 months before I leave my new job and 2 months 9 days until I get married.  I am really excited and looking forward to doing this but at the same time it is going to be a huge change for me.  Except for the short time spent in Dallas and South Africa I have spent my entire life in this area.  As much as people knock Waco it is not a bad city.  It is small and not over crowded, heck rush hour traffic consist of a 5 minute wait at Waco Dr. and Franklin.  But San Antonio is a good place and I guess sink or swim here I come.  The car is going great but will be put on hold until after the wedding die to time and room problems.  I hope to update this a little more regularly, but that is just a Patrick’s Life.
