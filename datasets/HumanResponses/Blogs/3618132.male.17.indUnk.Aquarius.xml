      Before I start, yes I know who you are, anonymous person. I'm just calling you anonymous person because...well I don't really know why, but it seemed like a nice idea.  Anyway, so on friday, my mom and I woke up at around 4 in the morning and got last minute things packed. We caught BART at 5:30, and took an hour and a half ride to the SFO Airport. Now for those who don't take BART at all, lemme tell you something. It's really fucking boring. The only parts that are of any interest is when you have to duck and cover while you ride through Oakland, and then you have to cover your ass when you get to San Francisco. I'm kidding of course, but only about the SF joke. After arriving at SFO, we had to get your bag checked, and then boarded our plane. Wow, exciting. The plane ride was about an hour long. After arriving at San Diego, we got lost on our way to the baggage claim, found the baggage claim, waited far too long for the baggage to arrive, and then caught a cab to my uncle's house.  Now maybe I should explain a few things about my uncle. He is shorter than I am, and a little chubby. (Okay, he's fat, but not too fat.) He is also a very angry little man. VERY ANGRY. He also has a great sense of humor and drinks like a fish. The alchohol cabinet looks like a half of a bar. He doesn't get drunk, but he does drink quite a bit. He's an attorney, and used to work in SF, but was fired for a reason I'll get into later. As it is now, He's the highest rank of attorney there is, and he's very good at his job. Therefore, he is rollin' in the benjamins. And yes, I promise to never say that again. His house is quite large. It's like three times the size of my house. He's a great cook, and I should also mention that if God had a backyard, it would look like my uncle's. I swear, it's like the fucking secret garden back there. Now I'm not one for yardwork; I hate it, but this man's backyard would bring any environment hating conservative *coughbushcough* to his knees. I wish I had pictures, because it's absolutely beautiful. Anyway, what else can I say about my uncle....oh yeah. He's gay. His partner, Eddie, is a really cool guy from the south. A southern accent+gayness=very gay man. He's great though. Compared to my uncle, he's a giant. He also doesn't drink, due to an addiction in the past. I don't know how he does it, living with my uncle and not drinking. Together, they own a dog, Brodie, thats always fun to be around. Having only cats myself, being around a dog for a couple days was a lot of fun.  So, on the first day all we did was sleep in the backyard/garden of God. Then on the second day, we had to go to a birthday partt of a friend of my uncle's and Eddie's. That was pretty boring, seeing as how I knew no one there, and no one was really making any kind of effort to talk outside their little group of people they already knew. But the food was really good. Especially the cake. Uagh....  Err, anyway, after the party, (it wasn't a partay, just a party) we went back to my uncle's house and ...slept. The problem with being around an older generation is, they always fall asleep. So I went and listened to some music and kind of dozed off. Once everyone had woken up, we ate dinner, talked around a firepit outside for a few hours, then went to sleep.  Sunday, we all woke up, took the dog to the beach, then drove to the airport for another 3 hour marathon of travel home. After getting home, we check the mail, and my report card had arrived while we had been away.   Fuck.   Well that wasn't good, but it's over now. I'd go into detail about what happened, but that would involve opening up, and we all know I don't do that shit. All in all, I had a lot of fun on the trip, despite way too much sleeping. It was boring, but it was very relaxing, and that was nice. I missed my guitar though. Hehe, fuck my friends, I just wanted my guitar. *tear*

      Ok, seriously, after not going out of the house for a few days, thats sun really hurts the eyes. And that, is fucking sad. Anyway, I went to lunch with my dad today. We ate at Fudruckers, or as I like to call it, Rudfuckers, (Why? Just another reason to be vulgar, thats why.) and we ate...food, imagine that! After that, we went and looked around in CompUSA for a while, because both my dad and I are total nerds. I then learned that I forgot my house key, and my mom wasn't home. So we drove to Orchard, then Trader Joe's, then to my dad's place, then I went home. After that, I had to help out my mom with some packing, and then just sort of did nothign for a while. Dinner came, dinner went, and now I'm sitting here typing this.  So, tomorrow my mom and I have to take BART to SFO at like 5:30 in the moring to fly down to San Diego for the weekend. We are visiting my uncle. It better be fun. Otherwise, I want my sleep-time back. As it is, I don't think I'll go to bed at all, because really, what's the point? it's already 11:50, I usually don't go to sleep till 3, so why go to sleep at all?  And so ends another riveting entry in this pile of crap.

      Well, one person is reading this (or at least commenting on this) so hello anonymous person! I know who you are, you know (presumably) who you are, but NO ONE ELSE DOES. Now if that isn't creepy and entertaining fun for the whole family I don't know what is.  If something interesting doesn't happen, I'm going to kill. KILL! BLOOD! KILL! You know, for a start to summer, the way this one is going, I'll be screaming at the windows by next week. Well ok, that started a week ago, but in another week's time, it could be very bad. Very bad indeed. Think about that, won't you? DO IT YOU LITTLE FUCKER!!!  Who am I talking to? that wasn't directed at you, anonymous person, it was directed at the population in general. So no hurty. Pweeze?  I found Brand New and Franz Ferdinand guitar tab today. That was the highlight of the day. I need a fucking social life.

      I've been giggling like a fucking nutcase off and on for the past half hour. This is why I don't have caffeine. Or maybe it's the brutal boredom I've suffered from these past few days. OR, OR, MAYBE, it's some sick lovechild of the caffeine and boredom. Yeah, that has to be it. My boredom and caffeine got together and had a huge fuckfest, and now I'm giggling like a crazy manly schoolgirl.  On to other thing. ................ ...  ..  Ok, I don't really have anything else.

      So I guess today (or should i say yesterday,) oh fuck it, monday, was a pretty boring day. I spent a great portion of the day asleep. I woke up at 12, ate, did the dishes, then went back to sleep till about 5:30. And that was my day. I gotta find something to do, and I don't mean summer school work. Oh, and I messed around on the guitar for maybe an hour, before getting fed up with myself. God I suck.  I read a bit more of Fast Food Nation today. Wow, that was sad. It hasn't made me want to not eat fast food yet, but some of the stories in there are terrible, like the one about the little boy who died of E Coli. He was six years old and got the bug from a hamburger. He began to get stomach cramps and filled a hospital toilet with blood. The doctors drilled holes in his head to relieve pressure, and stuck tubes in his chest to allow him to breath, but it didn't help any. Near the end of it, he was suffering from hallucinations and couldn't recognize anyone before dying five days after he had started to get sick. The book says portions of his brain were fucking LIQUIFIED. Thats gotta be a terrible way to go.  There was another story about a guy that worked in a meatpacking plant that was just as bad, but not in the same kind of way. I really don't feel like typing it though, because I'm lazy. So, I'm...not going to. I stopped reading the Inferno entirely in an effort to finish Fast Food Nation. Wasn't that an interesting tidbit of info?  I really have to come up with better things to write about.  On to music! My obsession with Brand New has not gone away, and it's been a few months now. Out of their two Cd's, I'd have to favor Deja Entendu over Your Favorite Weapon, because, well, everything is just more interesting. All the songs seem very personal and not one track seems like filler. Well, except for maybe the first one, but it's the starting track, so thats fine.  I saw Mystic River a couple days ago, (did I already mention that?) and it was a very good movie. Depressing, but very good. The ending left a lot to be desired if you wanted everyone to get what they had coming to them, but I thought it fit really well. I also saw Along Came Polly, which wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. It just was.  When I come up with something interesting to say, I swear it will redeem these crappy posts. What the fuck am I talking about? I'm the only one that knows this thing even exists......

      Wow, what a boring day this has been. woke up, watched Mystic River, which was a great movie, then just sort of did nothing for the rest of the day. Then saw Along Came Polly, which wasn't a great movie, then lazed around some more. Today was so unproductive, I actually feel a little guilty about it. I really did NOTHING all day. but tomorrow, oh I have BIG plans! Well not really, but it made me sound interesting. Well, probably not, but still. I'm going to try and get some homework done, and practice the guitar a bit, as long as no more strings fucking break.  Right now I'm just chatting and listening to music, good ol' Feeder, can't go wrong there. I found tab for Incubus' Megalomaniac, and I'm trying to get that down. I fail. Miserably.

      Yeah, so yesterday after dinner, I went out to Target and bought a few cd's, a Brand New one, a Franz Ferdinand one, and a Lostprophets one too. Good times. So, I've been listening to Franz Ferdinand pretty much nonstop, because I'm just a freak like that.  Then today, I ended up going to Antioch to attend a picnic. This consisted of four people sitting at a table in the park just talking for about 2 and a half hours. It was pretty fun though. Not bad, not bad. It's too bad that people ketp bringing up a certain Round Table incident though. I didn't realize they had fucking pictures. Eh, it's fine though, those are the memories you'll always have.  Even if you wanted to forget them.  So now I'm at home writing this because I'm bored, which is the only reason I started one of these things anyway. Meh, in a few weeks, I'll be too lazy to keep this up, i guarantee it, but while it lasts, i'm going to enjoy myself damn it!

      Before I start on what happened tonight, I'll talk about yesterday.  Melissa Rachel and Jahnava dinged and donged. My doorbell. It worked this time too, because they didn't call first. Afterwards, they came inside and tried to steal my pillows. They also went through my clothes and BREATHED MORE OF MY AIR!!!  Onto what happened tonight. Possibly the oddest night I've ever had.  So Pat, David and I go down to the mall and walk around for a few minutes, go into like two stores, then take the bus to my house. From there, we decide to go down to Jon's house and then with Jon, walk down to the Park N Shop. Now Pat, he's come prepared for evil doings. He's written down "For a good time call," and then a number. He wanted to hand them out to people at the mall, but since we didn't stay long, he was content to put them on cars and in mailboxes along the way to Jon's house. When we pick up Jon, things start to get a little weird.  Now the whole way down to Jon's place, nothing odd happens. All of a sudden, once Jon's with us, the night got a lot more interesting.  So we're walking down Jon's street to the Park N Shop, and we're all just talking, laughing, acting like idiots, and I say something about fucking me in the ass. I don't remember why, but it was in context to what we were talking about. (This should come as no surprise to anyone who knows any of us.) A hispanic man on a bike hears me and starts to comment on it. We couldn't make out anything he said, but he sounded angry. He ketp pedaling for a ways while yelling at use, and then got off his bike, left it on the sidewalk, and started following us. After we turned a corner, he disappeared. We all thought it was kinda funny, but it was still a little creepy.  This is just the beginning.  Of all the things to set off a homeless man, "choo choo" is possibly the most random.  We're walking down the sidewalk, and we're at a red light waiting for the light to change so we can cross the street over by the back of Petsmart. Pat says "choo choo!" some random black guy that we had just passed turned around and said "choo choo?" Pat looks a little confused. We all do. He repeats it, "choo choo?" and starts walking back toward us. Pat stammers out something like, "uh..yeah...whaa?" and the black guy starts talking. "My cousin took the train to Alabama!" He said a lot of other stuff too, but I was too surprised to catch much of it. This is when Jon and David turn around to hide their laughter. Pat is just confused, because the guy was talking directly to him, and I was couldn't turn away. Frozen, in place, trying not to laugh, trying desperately to turn away. The man continued with something along the lines of "do you know how to get to Lafayette?" And Pat is speechless. by this point, he's talking to me too, because I'm the only one besides Pat that has been unable to turn away. I told him to take BART or something, then Jon says "Oh look, the light has changed, well we'll be seeing you." and we all run off. At a safe distance, we were laughing so hard, we couldn't breath. Of all the random crap Pat could have said, he HAD to pick the only one that sparked a conversation with a less than same homeless man.  But wait, there's more!  Burger King is always a treat.  Ordering the food is always painless enough, it's once we sit down that things become more...painful. Really, you laugh so hard it hurts. I don't remember all that was said, but it was quite funny, and very random. And of course, Pat can't help but vomit up a little. This time it was only some spit on himself, but still, very funny. After Pat begins to look like he really might vomit from laughter, we all ditch him and start walking down to the Brenden without him. He was left to clean up our trash, and whatever little...mess...he made. We don't know. We didn't ask. While we were walking without pat, a woman who looked like she might be in her 40's or 50's walked out a chinese restaurant and told us that if we all smiled, she'd show us something very nice.  .....  That was our initial reaction of total surprise.  None of us smiled. Except Jon, he couldn't help it. The lady proceeds to point in the vicinity right between David and me and says she hasn't seen him smile yet. Neither of us had any intention of smiling. Then two people who obviously knew her walked out of the restaurant and told her that was not a thing she should ask strangers. She responds with "but it is nive" and points at the moon. The couple proceed to shepherd her away and give us appologetic looks. After a discreet time, we laugh until we can't breath. This is how Pat finds us, and he was sorry he missed out on the fun.  We walked down to Brenden, went in the parking lot, and placed Pat's whore cards on some of the cars, before walking back to my place where we watched a freeky Grandaddy video with people dressed up in animal suits, followed by Happy Tree Friends, then Red Vs Blue. Then they all left.   Creepiest, funniest, oddest night ever,

      Today dropped by Rasputins and bought a few CD's. So now in my spare time I've been listening almost exclusively to Snow Patrol's song Run, which is possibly the most beautiful sad song (with an uplifting chorus) I've ever heard.  Then after I got back I did the dishes. I did them like no other. I'm sure they won't soon forget the experience; I know I won't. After the dishes were done, David came over and we were bored for several hours. Bored like no other. Seriously, when you go back and forth for over two hours asking the same question "what do you want to do" you know there might be a problem. Good times. It was better than just asking myself what I wanted to do, so it wasn't really a waste of time though. I'm not exactly sure if what I'm typing in is making any sense, as I'm too tired to really focus on what is being said. I think I'll go to bed.  And as for the obligatory Melissa reference, I didn't really talk to you today, and that made me sad.

      I feel that I should say this; if you're going to doorbell ditch someone, do not call first to make sure it's ok. It defeats the whole purpose. Unlike knocking on the living room window so hard that the house shakes late at night, dingdonging my door will NOT result in a 911 call.   On a related note, that bran muffin sure was good.

      So i'm pulling up carpet, and the phone rings. It's....THE ASIANS!!!   ....sorry.   Melissa, Mark, and Rachel invaded my personal bubble and BREATHED MY AIR! (Which has been known to cause cancer and possibly AIDS) They only did it to drop off a CD and pick up a CD, but in the process stole a movie, and wrote on my wall. Or, on the thing on my wall. Thats made for writing on. But thats not the point. The point is....it was nice to have a break from the carpet work. Feel free to distract me any time. And if I had a car, I'd be driving over to your homes and peeking in the windows 24/7. Sweet dreams...   Are made of these, travel the world and the sev....damn it, I tried so hard, but I just couldn't help it. I'm such a failure.

      Right. So, This morning, I went and helped out David and his grandfather put a lot of furniture and stuff in a Uhaul that is going to be taken and sold for his grandfather's organization, NAMI. I got paid twenty bucks too, not bad. Then, David came back to my place and we played videogames for about an hour before getting bored, so we decide to call up Jon and Pat. Well we reach pat, and he arrives at my house. Soon afterwards we reach Jon, so we decide to walk down to Burger King and pick up Jon on the way, since his house is, well, on the way. On the way there, Pat was yelling something about wanting crack, and some little girl in a car was flirting with us. Creepy, yet strangely satisfying.  The real reason we went to BK is that we wanted to see if Pat would throw up again, and to a certain extent he did, but it was just a fry. David almost threw up, and Jon managed to keep all his food down. Pat took all the little stickers off our food and scratched them to see if we won anything, and we did. A pie, and a few other things. Each time he scratched a winner, he yelled out in a really high pitched loud voice "I win!" The first time, someone about to order turns around and says "What the fuck was that?" Pat did it two more times too. It was great. I'm surprised we didn't get kicked out.  After we were finished eating, we walked around the Park and Shop for a while trying to come up with something to do. Mainly, we were just making a lot of noise. Well on our little stroll, we found a shopping cart. Pat gets in first, but he doesn't allow himself to get pushed very far before jumping out. Then it was my turn. (David and Jon were too big, so they didn't do it) So pat ends up pushing me up to a pretty fast speed, hoping I hit a curb and bail out. I few by a couple of asian people working for the asian resturant while wearing a BK crown hat. They just stared. After slowing down enough to get out without hitting a curb, I had to chase the rest of them down, as they tried to ditch me. Bastards. Then pat comes up with the idea to get a bunch of BK crowns and hand them out in McDonalds. So, we go back and get hats. But right before we get there, David asked if we were really going to go through with it, and everyone wimped out. I would have done it, but not alone. So then we decide to hand them out to people by Brenden. Well that doesn't happen either, since it was just a stupid idea. Instead, we decorated someones Beetle with it in the parking structure. Two on the top, one on either side mirror, one on the back, and one on the bumper. It looked so ridiculous when we were finished. As we leave, a cop car rolls by, and that was kinda funny in a creepy way, since we were all wearing a BK crown. We walked to my house from there, yelling at passing cars and some guy across the street.  Once we got back to my house, my mother tells me that I accidentally locked her out of the house when we went to get Jon. She had to knock out a lock with a sledgehammer to get inside. If it had happened to anyone else, This would have been funny, but I felt bad. After I laughed. Hehe... So then we tell Pat to go outside and we attack him with Gold Bond powder.  Maybe I should take a bit of time to explain the Gold Bond Powder, which from here on out,  will be referred to as GBP. One day while David was over, I sprayed him with it. He ran away and tried to lock himself in the bathroom, but I was able to get my hand in the door and sprayed blindly. Sprayed blindly right up his nose. It got in his nose, mouth, eyes and all over his face and shirt. He couldn't breathe, all he could taste was that crap, and we was surrounded by a dust cloud that takes about an hour to settle completely. It was fucking hilarious, but when I sprayed it, he swung the door open and the cloud launched at me too. So we were both coughing, but he got it a lot worse than I did. So then another time later, Jon and David were both in my room. Not like that. Sicko. Anyway, David give me the GBP and motions to Jon. So I do what I was asked and spray him. well it ends up going everywhere, including me, my room, and Jon. Then Jon gets David into a headlock, so I spray him with it. Again, David got it worse. Well my room did, but David got it worst of the people. So now when we lure Pat outside, it was past ten, and farily dark. He got fucked up. I start it, and blind him with it, then David wants a turn, and starts spraying the shit out of him. Then I get it back and while Pat is on the ground screaming and rubbing his eyes, spray him some more. This  is when Jon and David go inside and lock me and Pat outside. Well I think I'm going to get my ass beat, but Pat has no idea whats going on, because he literally can't see. So I run to the front of the hosue and go in that way, while Pat is stumbling around the backyard running into stuff and apologizing to the people he only thinks are there. Then, everyone went home.  Joyriding in a shopping cart is fucking fun.  Having the banana phone stuck in your head isn't.

      This post is dedicated to Melissa, who brings me up in her journal all the time and deserves a place in mine. Earning a place in my journal (if you could call it that) is not an easy task. You have to ASK for it, and that involves talking to me. Now most people would be scared away by this looming prospect, but no, not Melissa. Fearless of having to listen to babbling idiocy, she talks to me quite a bit, of which I am very grateful. It's not every day a girl talks to me. Anyway, now I'll release a bunch of extremely personal information about her, for everyone to see. Ok, not really. Yesterday, she drove me and her to Target. Her driving scares me. Well, not really her driving, it's the parking that makes me wet myself.  ...You might want to wash the passenger seat.  I know this is a very ....bad post, but I promise to write more in general, and mention you at least TWICE a week, so I can be better than you! NYAH!  Ok, I apologize for that, it was childish

      Well, it's Friday. Which means I have a weekend ahead that I get to spend with my mom! YAY! God, I hope I can get out of the house. Maybe wild hyena's can rip at my nads or something. I just don't want to do yeardwork. I know, I'm a baby.  I don't really have much to write. Cleaning up bingo was oh so much fun! I love showing off my manly physique by lifting up chairs and tables! Well, I don't have a manly physique, but if I did, it would be shown. I have pouty breasts, does that count?  ...I gave MYSELF shivers there.  Ok, I admit, I'm just trying to cover for the fact that I have nothing to write. Instead I'm rambling. On, and on, and on. Yeeeup.... Lets see how much I can write on absolutely nothing.  Well, I should be reading Sophie's World, but I'm not, because the book is boring as sin. Now that I think about it, depending on the sin, it's probably not boring, but that doesn't change the fact that the book is. Wow, strange sentence. Bad grammar. Or was it? I don't know, I'm not going to go back and read over it. I'm sitting here, typing this, chatting, listening to music... I was going to practice the guitar a little, but I'm too lazy to get up and get it. It's sad. It's only like 10 feet away, calling me...  "Michael.....come to me....play with me...."  Ok, that was a dramatization of what was going on in my head. I found new tab today. That was exciting. I sat in my room for like 3 hours earlier and was just playing. It's relaxing, just sitting there, playing. It's relaxing for me anyway, I don't know, it may not sound too hot, but someday, I'm sure it will. I hope.  I've been listening to Stabbing Westward for a while. Long enough that 32 songs are starting to repeat. I think I'll change it. Ah, Brit rock. Thats better. Mew, Muse, Feeder, Franz Ferdinand, Ash, Radiohead, and Snow Patrol. And...GASP! hardly any of it is depressing! I feel like dancing among the bunnies and ponies now. If there were any. For your information, there aren't. I'm all alone, except for the cat, which sits there licking herself suggestively on my bed.  I gave myself more shivers.  Ok, this has gone on long enough.  END!

      Well, today sure was interesting. Thats all I really have to say. It wasn't a particulary good day, but it's not all because of...that, it's because of other things too that I'm not going to go into because... I don't feel like it. Too tired to write in everything that happened today. So for the time being, I'll just say after going to the mall with Melissa, the day just sort of went downhill with a dinner that really didn't make things any better.  All in all at the end of the day, I just felt... blank.   ....Now that everyone is suitably confused, I'll stop typing. Suckas!

      Well, today was interesting. Well, more interesting than if nothing had happened. I sort of lazed around for a few hours in the morning. Well, okay. I lazed around from about 11 to 2 or 3. It was quite sad. But then Mellisa stopped by and gave me a cookie, which is now a part of me. I meant I ate it. Sickos. We drove to the library and she made me run, then she drove me home while hiding from my mother.  Tomorrow I'm going to have to do all the crap that I didn't do today. Damn, but thats what happens when you put things off. Speaking of putting thing off, I read another 100 pages in Sophie's World today. I'm now on page 300, and this book is FUCKING MY MIND. It's boring, dry, and not making a lot of sense at the present time. And somehow, I doubt it's going to get any better. Fucking smart Norweigens... (spelling pending)  In other news thats not really news at all but I just had no other good transition in mind... So there's this band, and they call themselves The Mars Volta, and they're FUCKING AWESOME. I've heard a few songs, but I've been listening to the song Televators quite a bit. It's a great song. If you're bored and have nothing better to do, look into it. If you regret it, well, fine. But you won't.  I really didn't practice guitar or trumpet at all today. Well, I use the term "practice trumpet" loosely. It sounds like there's a very frightened elephant in the house. And even though there isn't, there are still two very frightened cats.  Damn it all.

      Mellisa asked me to go to this birthday party for her mother. (Right?) So I went.  I had a pretty fun time. We mostly just sat around and talked the whole evening. I met Jahnava's french foreign exchange student, and came to a startling realization. The French are JUST LIKE US!! Anyway, we tried to watch a movie, but there were some complications. *coughfuckyouallcough* I'm just kidding, I wasn't mad. Mark insisted on gelling up my hair, and as we can all agree on, that was a mistake. Part of the deal was he had to wear his hair like he did in the sixth grade and again, I think we can all agree that was probably a bigger mistake. Then Jahnava started putting clips in my hair. I didn't see myself; thats a good thing. The French girl Maud, stayed mercifully silent. No wonder other countries hate us.  Mellisa was kind enough to wash the gel out of my hair and take out both my eyes in the process. I smelled pretty! After that, we ate some cake, inhaled some helium, melted some soldiers, and went home.  ------------  Today, I finally got to meet Pat's g/f, who is, contrary to popular belief, totally real. Hmm, that didn't sound exactly how I wanted it to, but I stand by it. She's also quite pretty and very tolerant. She would have to be. Tolerant, I mean. We went bowling first, then got pizza. The bowling was quite pathetic all the way around. Pat and I barely broke 100 on the second game, but the first game everyone was pretty even in the suckage. I'm talking to 60 to 80 range.  We went and got pizza, which I really didn't pay for, (thanks whoever paid for me) and ate it. Imagine that. Eating pizza! I also watched as Mellisa, Mark, and Pat DDR'd. My eyes, my poor poor eyes. Mark gets all 70's on the pad, Mellisa tried her hardest to break it, and Pat half-assed his way through half a song. Then we went home. And thanks again Mellisa for giving me a ride. Even if it was in the back seat. Because you hate me. And I cry. Now.

      Well, the day before, (thursday?) Mellisa and Mark dropped by and hung around for a few minutes. We played connect four and then they stole one of my softer-than-the-pubes-of-God pillows. Mellisa also tried to clean my room, but it was a lost cause. It was nice of them to stop by. It kept me busy and entertained in what would have otherwise been a total waste of a day.  Then Friday, I was supposed to go with David Pat and Jon to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, but David's mom was late (as always) so we didn't get to see it. Instead we walked down to Fry's and bought an XBox controller. We went back to Jon's house and Poked at Pat while he was trying to plat UT2k4, and then after a while went to my place and spent the rest of the night up until about 10 playing Halo.  Doing nothing alone is just that, nothing. Doing nothing with company is something.

      Mr Morty Moore (11:03:43 PM): over the green green hill. . ..  Mr Morty Moore (11:03:48 PM): where the blue birds sing Mr Morty Moore (11:03:56 PM): and inhale the toxic air . . .and die. . .  Ah, love poetry.
