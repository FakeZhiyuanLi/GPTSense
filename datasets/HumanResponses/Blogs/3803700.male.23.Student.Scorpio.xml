              It is inescapable, the price of gas in this country is rising everyday and there appears to be no relief in sight.  A resident of Lancaster County, I live on an acreage just outside of Bennet.  I used to drive an SUV, a vehicle that I thought I needed to traverse the miles of dirt and gravel roads that made their way into Lincoln.  But recently I down sized to an all-wheel drive car, and after a winter of above average snowfall, I can proudly say that I did not get stuck once! 	I thought I needed an SUV, and there were times that its big size and above average power came in handy, but I have learned to live without it and as a result the gas prices are not as alarming as they once were.  We live in a super-sized society, where bigger is always better.  In an effort to keep up with the Jones’ our driveways and garages are now filled with gargantuan fuel hogs, whose thirst exemplifies America’s lust for gratuity. 	At the same time gas prices are going up we are fighting a war on top of one of the world largest oil reserves.  The multi-billion dollar oil industry is already well represented inside of Iraq, and has been awarded numerous US contracts.  Some of the terrorists that we are fighting think that we are attempting to colonize them, and while their tactics are brutal and inhumane, one has to admit that if Saddam Hussein was the ruler of Burundi he would still be in power. 	If you want to make a difference in the war on terror the first thing that you can do is demand a new energy policy from your senators, representatives, and most importantly your President. The second thing you can do is demand that automakers build a car that gets good gas mileage or uses alternative fuels of hybrid technology.  And finally you can realize that you the consumer can make a difference in the world by demanding a more responsible level of consumption from yourself and others

      What if you found yourself in the middle of a rugged, arid land, traveling alone, and you stumbled across a tall slender man wearing a long robe and traveling by foot with a large group of others dressed like him?  You might get closer to see who it was, and when you got closer you would see that this man is not just any man, it is the most wanted man in the world, it is Usama Bin Ladin.  You might also notice that the “evil one” is just a man, albeit a tall man, but just a man nonetheless. Aside from the fact that Bin Ladin’s radical politics have spread fear and death wherever they permeate, Bin Ladin has been able to affect the world in other ways as well.  Without Bin Ladin, our country would never have invaded Iraq, despite the fact that Hussein and Bin Ladin never spoke.  The Administration would have not been able to use the fear that Bin Ladin has created to its advantage.  Bin Ladin, who is just a man, has been transformed into a monolithic, almost supernatural boogey man, who eludes our capture and continues his evil plotting.  For the sake of the families affected by Bin Ladin’s violence he desperately needs to be brought to justice, and for the sake of our imagination he needs to be brought to justice.  The longer he eludes us the longer people will think he is everywhere and nowhere all at once.  Bin Ladin’s image has caused the people of America, Spain, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Indonesia and other countries too much grief, and his image has allowed our own President to create a supernatural identity of his own.  You and I live in a world where we always want to appear more than what we are, some of us are better at it than others, some have even reached a super-status of immortal, but Bush and Bin Ladin are just men, that’s it.

      Walking out of a large federal building, and older gentleman was only beginning to think about what the documents he had covered would mean to a very important investigation.  Being asked by the most salient commission in all the land this gentleman was to testify before it, and before the world.  The gentleman I speak of is Sandy Berger, and he came under a great amount of criticism today, when it was leaked that he had taken documents and not returned them.  What the FBI is telling us up to this point is that all documents are accounted for except for a few, and that Mr. Berger took them out of a federal facility without asking, probably in his leather binder.  Bill Clinton told reporters that the documents missing, those in question were duplicated and is available at other federal facilities.  The 9/11 Commission, the commission for which Mr. Berger was reviewing the document for is satisfied with what Mr. Berger has told them, and required nothing else of him.  To hear Flush Limbaugh or Sean “Hannitize ya” Hannity talk about it, you would think that Berger was selling top secret information to Al Qaeda from the back of his car.  Hannity claims that Berger smuggled out vital documents in his pants and sox, and disposed of them so that the Clinton Administration could not be blamed for its possible neglect of important information.  The information it seems was in reference to the Millennium plot, a plot that was successfully thwarted by Richard Clarke’s team and the Clinton Administration. The fact that the report was leaked just two days before the 9/11 Commission is set to release its report, a report that potentially will be very critical of the Bush Administration, is somewhat suspect.  The fact that Hannity and Limbaugh and others will claim that this is Clinton trying to cover his tail is also absurd, it was the Bush Administration who so vehemently opposed the creation of the commission in the first place.  If you were waiting for the Administrations “pre-report surprise” here you go.

      It is all over the news, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called California Democrats, who are refusing to negotiate with him on a spending plan, Girlie Men.  Of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger is referring to the Dana Carvey, and Kevin Nealon sketch from Saturday Night Live, and in his own little way making fun of himself.  What followed was yet another polarizing effect which seems all to commonplace in politics.  On one hand Schwarzenegger’s 67% approval rating (the highest for any California governor, in recent history, including Ronald Regan) shot way up.  On the other hand many complained that he was playing up homosexual, and feminine stereotypes, and therefore should apologize.  There is something very rare in Schwarzenegger, something that many of his Republican counterparts do not have, and that is a good sense of humor.  Schwarzenegger has been able to be socially moderate, while still representing a fiscally conservative stance that has been the core of traditional Republican policy.  I love him for everything I hate about our current selection of Republican candidates.  And at the risk of starting controversy, I would say that Schwarzenegger’s incredible charisma, no-nonsense attitude and decidedly outsider label reminds me of another man who said all the right things, and all the wrong things at the same time: Bill Clinton.  People like Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton show us that when a candidate comes into the established political atmosphere and does not roll over right away they will be popular with the people and despised by their adversaries… and their adversaries are Girlie Men.

      The word “terrorism” used to be scary to me; it conjured images of masked men with no mercy, torturing and killing innocent men, women and children.  It elicited the kind of imagery that would define a cruel inhuman existence where injustice ruled the day.  But now the term “terrorism” means something else, and to be honest it is getting kind of fruity.  Vernon Robinson, the new Jesse Helms, called a group of gay activists “Terrorists” in his personal statement on his campaign website.  The pro-lifers have begun to call women’s health clinic employees “Terrorists.”  The Patriot Act helps the government find “Terrorists” by accessing library records, because the “Terrorists” are apparently attempting to seed their hateful propaganda in the seemingly innocent covers of your child’s favorite Dr. Seuss book.  The government stops old ladies in wheelchairs at airports because they might be “Terrorists.”  Look, if the terrorists are hiring old ladies to blow up airplanes, then…they deserve to win.  The term “Terrorism” no longer holds the context of fear that it probably should, and the only people that are really scaring me anymore are the leaders of this country who come out at least once a week to tell me that the “Terrorists” are everywhere and will kill me when they get the chance. You cannot live your life in fear, because your fear gives other people power, and the more fear that Ashcroft, Ridge, and Bush spread, the more power they have.

      1.1 Million displaced, and 400,000 waiting for food, which will die in the next 3 weeks if they do not get it.  Arab Muslims on horseback and Camelback have been committing mass murder and even genocide against black Muslims and Christians who occupy parts of northern Sudan, and their scorched earth policy is the biggest criminal act in the new 21st century.  The lighter skin Muslims rape women who gather water outside of the refugee camps in an effort to breed out the black, meanwhile their husbands are brutally killed. I watched as 1 million Rwandans were killed in a low-tech genocide that was not addressed by our politicians.  These horseback murderers in Sudan are no match for even a small US or UN intervention force, and any force that could be used would literally save hundreds of thousands of lives. So why wait, do not let Rwanda happen again, I do not want to ask the obvious question again: When will we learn?

      Jason Giambi won the home run derby tonight, and it made me really mad, because I hate it when the sell-out wins.  I hate it even more that he got paid more to hit those balls than I will ever see in at least the next 10 years, and he will make more money this baseball season than I will in my entire life.  Unless you are Spiderman, and you run around saving people’s lives no one deserves to make that much money to play a GAME! Of course Alex Rodriguez was watching his Yankee teammate from the rich kid dugout, he was probably trying to come to terms with the adjustments he will have to make since he accepted a slight pay cut to become a New York Yankee.  George W. Bush and his business partners sold the Texas Rangers for a hefty $250 million in the late 1990s, soon after that, that team signed Alex Rodriguez for $252 million for 10 seasons.  Today “A-Rod” plays for the Yankees and makes roughly $16,000 per at bat.  I thought about buying a new Subaru for $16,300, which to A-Rod is an at bat, and a pinch run, in the end I could not afford it.  Now I am not angry about the fact that at 23 I already have more education that Mr. Rodriguez and I am poor and he is rich, I am mad because his salary has killed baseball.  I am mad because all of the pro “athletes” make enough money to feed the whole world, all of it, the whole thing, and they usually don’t even pay for their own meals.  It is out of control, and when Usama Bin Laden tells his followers that the US is full of hedonistic, materialistic, rich guys, I look at what we pay our entertainers and athletes, and I agree with him, and that makes me mad.

      “Dick Cheney could be President” This was President Bush’s response to a question from a reporter which asked him to compare his running mate to his opponent’s.  I know that politics is a dirty game, but it has seemingly gotten dirtier. It was just a few weeks ago that Vice President Cheney told a distinguished member of the Senate to “go fuck yourself”, and then refused to apologize for it, in fact he told reporters that he “felt better” after he did it. This Administration is getting the corner on macho, and their Marlboro Man appeal seems to have been deeply entrenched in their strategy, and if that is how they want to play that is fine, but it is inappropriate to then criticize the vulgarity of the comedians and performers at Kerry’s rally.  If you are going to be mean and that is how you want to portray yourself to the American people, the least you can do is not be a hypocrite.

      It seems that before we are able to talk about the differences between the candidates, we need to first address the differences between the parties.  Parties, especially in America are by no means monolithic, despite what commentators and journalists would like you to believe.  There are traditional conservatives, there are Reagan conservatives, there are neo-conservatives, there are southern and northern democrats, and there are pro-choice democrats, and these are just to name a few. Having made our way through the last four years however, the American public has become polarized in a way that I have never seen in my 23 years of life.  But I am astonished by the fact that the bigger polarized mainstream political populations are targeting the smaller groups within the parties for consumption. Perhaps we have all fallen for what seems to be the bigger end game: election 2004.  Is it possible that the stakes have gotten so high that party pluralism is being sacrificed and along with all of the difference of opinions that is key to a functioning democracy?  It certainly seems so.  Whether Bush is reelected seems to be “the” big issue.  I must admit that I have fallen victim to the consolidation of opinion, I voted for Ralph Nader in the last election, but I would be foolish to vote for him again because on my side of the fence there is one goal, and one slogan: Anybody But Bush.  Maybe it should be: Anything But Choice

      This was published in the July 1, 2004 Lincoln Journal Star Letter to the Editor Section  On conservative talk shows and even in op-ed pieces in local and national papers, people have been loud in their criticisms of the new Michael Moore film "Fahrenheit 9/11." Criticism is a normal and even healthy part of democracy, it really is, but what has disturbed me is that many are calling Moore's latest film "unpatriotic," and in many ways this just confirms many suspicions that I have had about this country.  We went to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction and destroy al-Qaida, neither of which occurred, so the Bush administration is telling everyone that we are going to democratize Iraq. I can't wait to see how we do it. How can the United States tell the Iraqis about the wonders of democracy when only 30 percent of us show up at the polls? How can we tell Iraq about democracy when unpopular voices are told they are unpatriotic when they question our leadership? How can we tell Iraq about democracy when the inherent conflict that makes democracy work is slowly being tamed?  What Michael Moore did was patriotic, especially if you disagree with him. Dissent is not just a feature of democracy; it is its cornerstone. Without an alternative point of view there can be no choice, there can be no democracy.  Tyler
