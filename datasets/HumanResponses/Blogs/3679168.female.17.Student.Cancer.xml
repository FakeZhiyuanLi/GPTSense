      Hung out wiht the girls tongiht. Kinda just started out as me and ashley. The night was fun but I remeberd why I didn't do it that much anymore. They all ways make me feel bad about my self. Not that I have that great of self esteem already but the remind me of all the bad things I do and it makes me feel bad. They always bring up the fact that i "get around" that I lie. do drugs, drink, and steal, and they always remind me im going to hell. So i'm like well geez. It really makes me think. I am really a whore? Yes and no then i just go with yes cause thats what they said. I just fool my self when i say no anyway. I only lie when it's neccasary, i only drink on average 1 or 2 times a week and i only do hard drugs 1 time every like 3 weeks and smoke weed liek amybe 1 time a week. and i only steal when i think its a rip off so am i really that bad. whatever though i guess thats just who i am and they are my friends and obviously they accept me actuall now that i think of it they are the damn bawstrad who make me do all the dirty work oh what the fuck i'll fucking admit it im a bitch!  i just realized i kinda just mumbled all that together problly doesnt make sense but i dont care i feel batter sorta

      My weekend was different than most weekends. On Saturday I had an all day cheer camp I got slightly burned. It wasn't all that fun. But whatever, then when I get home I have a senior cook out/sleepover for band there is only 20 of us so it's not tons of people it was fun but really weird at first. It was at ang's house so I went over there like at 2 to help her get ready and then people started showing up around 4 and I don't know it was weird. I think it's because I don't hang out with those people anymore and it was hard to relate to them at first. But by the end of the night everyone was getting along really well. We all went to bed around or something like that. Oh My. I lied the camp out was Sunday. What did I do Saturday then. Well it must not have been that important if I can't remember but I had to work Sunday morning and I got burned on top of my burn and now it hurt really bad and it blistering. Ouch! So any way Monday I had to work to and I only got paid 25 bucks what a rip-off. Then Monday we had a senior freshman cook out that was kind of fun but the freshman are really annoying. Well some are. They are loud and annoying. I mean I am too but I know when and when not to be. You know I can control my self. I made some new friends though. Freshman ones. Then after that I went home wasn't all that eventful. Today I had cheerleading at 8 it sucked we did our hour and a half work-out and then we mounted I got tore up cause of my sunbun but we almost have our 360 it rocks. I feel really bad for ang cause she got stuck with deneis and she's terrible and now ang is all like I want to base with Renee or I quite and I want to base with her too but Darcey and I are doing really well together we almost have a 360 with Rachel for god sakes. Rachel is the heaviest flier. Although she sure in hell isn't big! So cheerleading is crazy right now!

      Yah whatever. What's new, I do not what so ever feel bad she deserved it. I hope I got through to her and made sense though cause if I didn't it wasn't worth the breath. She needed to understand more than anyone why IM like that. I gave her the information she needed now it's up to her to do what she wants with it, whether it's keep it to her self, forget it, or be a better mom because of it.   What I said was very hurtful but I guess that's what I had to do. She doesn't listen to me and I hope she did this time. I told her that her and my dad were insignificant in my life and all they are to me is the people who put a roof over my head and give me money when I need it and as soon as I am able to provide that my self they wont mean anything to me. I told her that they treat me like shit and if they every want me to treat them respectfully again they have to earn it. What else I said is kind of hard to explain but I'll try, When I get in trouble for something small like not picking up my stuff I get in so much trouble for it that you cant punish me any more, so when I get in trouble for something really bad like not calling to tell them IM staying some were and when they finally call me at 2 am IM wasted well the trouble I get in for something like that is just as bad as not picking up after myself because I get in so much trouble for small things all the time it doesn't phase me when I do something really wrong. You know what IM saying. See its hard to put into words but I told her that and that that's the reason I laugh when IM in trouble because IM winning cause IM not mad. But I don't care they need to understand what they are doing. Yah my parents are fucked up I know!
