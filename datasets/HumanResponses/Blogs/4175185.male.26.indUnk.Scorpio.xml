						   When I first moved to Sanford, I transferred from the Shaw's in Auburn to the one here (obviously, right?)  Anyhoo, they didn't need a seafood clerk or really anyone, so they kind of squeezed me back in on the front end as a bagger/carryout and bottle clerk, but they can only give me 20 hours a week.  Yesterday when I got my check I got my schedule, which was for a little over 30 hours and I am being trained on the register.  What's funny is that if this had happened when I worked for Shaw's at first, I would have been so hyper and spastically happy.  Now I'm just happy that I'll be working inside on the register instead of outside getting sunburn behind a load of carts.  So that's cool.  More hours = more money.

						   I'm going to just share a few recommendations, computer-wise, with everyone.  Having been there before, I know that it's hideously expensive, so here's some random stuff for you, that doesn't cost a thing.   1.  Games   urlLink Snood , a nice mindless and addicting game.  urlLink Addicting games , my fiancee plays on this website all the time.   2.  Security   urlLink Ad-Aware , a program designed to root out spyware on your computer and get rid of it.  urlLink Spybot , another program like Ad-Aware, and it gets the stuff that Ad-aware misses.  Personally, I'd recommend purchasing the following software, as well, just because it's inexpensive and effective: ->Norton Internet Security (or just the Antivirus if you aren't online, but then if you're not online you're not reading this so that was just a useless parenthetical comment). ->Corel Office Suite (Works just like Micro$oft Office, at half the cost - but get the academic package at your school bookstore, because it has everything for less than the normal cost).  More free advice: 1.  Save your quarters.  They'll get you more than paper money. 2.  Have an academic problem?  Talk to the prof and get help.  That's what you're tuition money is for. 3.  Get enough sleep. 4.  Find a place to hang out with your friends, relax and make midnight runs for snacks.  That's about it for now.

						   Whew!  Did like, 3 days just fly by?  Monday, Andrewski and I were on a mission to clean out his room so that it is more livable.  Now, he and I have totally different approaches to things like cleaning.  For example, I like to try to get it done early and all at once, and he likes to get it done late and spread a 2 and a half hour project through 6 or 7 hours.  Don't get me wrong, he did help, it just got frustrating for everyone when I had to sit and wait for him while he went out to do some other stuff - read:  I wish we would have sat there and just done it all at once and gotten it over with so my day could have been free by 3:30 or 4.  But I really can't complain, because the room is more liveable and it looks a lot better right now.  Yesterday I was scheduled to work 12-5.  When I got in, one of the supervisors looked at me and said, "Steve, you're working until 9 tonight, right?"  I was like, "What?"  It turns out I was needed in bottles to close it.  And it just so happened that I needed the money, too, so it worked out for both Shaws and me.  I went home for a half hour at 5:15 and wound up getting out at 9:40.  (Sudden bursts of extreme activity are not my favorite thing.)  Today I was scheduled 11:30 to 4:30, and as I was about to leave the supervisor asked me to stay until 5.  At around 5:15, I asked him if I could leave yet.  I'm not complaining about the extra time that I'm getting right now - I was only scheduled for 20 hours so the extra hours are going to come in handy.  I just wish I had more notice than say, 5 seconds.  Although I can't say it was really bad.  I'm tired though.  Maybe it's because I woke up at 4:30 and 5:45 and 8:30 this morning, before my alarm was supposed to go off at 10.  Ah, well.

						    UFOs   Now here's something that gets me.  You see an object in the sky, and point at it, and you're like, "What's that?" "Oh, it's just a UFO" "What's a UFO?" "An Unidentified Flying Object." "What's that?" "That thing in the sky that we're wondering what it is."  So it's a clever description that consists of a few fancy terms that still doesn't answer the question.  It's accurate, because it is "unidentified" - because someone's asking what it is because they can't identify it.  It's also in the sky, and not falling, so it must be flying.  And, because it's a thing, it's an object.  So basically, to describe items flying around that nobody can figure out what they are, they apply the obvious and general term  unidentified flying object .  Oh, well, thanks, that really answers our question.  Sheesh.  It's like that whole Micro$oft engineer joke about giving an answer that's technically correct, but practically useless.

						   So I'm moved back home.  How do I feel about all this?  Well... ahem.  So I spend 5 years and $40,000 at UMF to get a degree in teaching.  Except by the end of my third semester there, I wasn't getting a teaching degree anymore.  Now it was History, minor in Computer Science.  Whoops, make that Political Science.  I graduate in 2002 with a B.A. in History, with a lousy 2.39 GPA.  I'll figure out the letter grade for that later, but I'm not happy with it.  Not only that, but it would be nice to get a Master's, or even a Ph.D. (hey, why not throw that out while I'm living in dreamland), but no grad school is going to take a student in with that kind of GPA.  I know, I looked - even UMO, which is ... well ... not exactly a top notch competitive school compared to others, won't look at students really hard unless they've earned a 3.0GPA.  Now, I can't go out and teach, either, because the State of Maine is more concerned that teachers know how to entertain, coerce, and bribe the kids into listening to them while they try to squeeze a lesson in between the show that they're supposed to give, than the teachers know the material they're teaching.  So, lacking classroom experience, I can't teach, which also means I can't get classroom experience, which, looking at my transcript, is really all I'm missing for certification.  Now I'm left with a degree that I feel is sometimes useless (because I can't use it for anything, like teaching) and worthless (because it's useless).  But, I can be taught!  And I'm trying to think of ways that I can use it, but of course that's depending on if any employer would let a kid with a 2.39 GPA do a job requiring the use of their knowledge.  Not many would.  Oh well.  Now, on top of that, I was employed at a convenience store in Farmington, started part time, worked that way for 2 years, then was promoted to Assistant Manager.  The problem with Cumberland Farms is this:  Assistant manager = glorified clerk.  In my case, also Assistant Manager = target for management hostility.  Through a very good friend of mine, I was informed that management was trying to get rid of me, and working very hard to get him to take my job so they could demote or fire me.  Then they'd write me up once a month for frivolous stuff, or stuff that I had done but someone else had undone (like taking old sandwiches off the case).  They finally fired me for telling a customer who had just purchased $100 in lottery tickets, "Gee, I wish I could afford a hundred bucks in lottery."  Two HR reps that I interviewed with later laughed and said, "That's it?"  The attorney I called said that the reason, and I do quote, "sucks", but nonetheless, was legal because Maine is an "employ at will" state - which means that any dumb reason that a company chooses to fire someone for, is perfectly acceptable, as long as it is not legally protected in anti-discrimination or anti-retribution statutes.  But that's okay - I later found out from that same friend of mine that, had they not fired me for that, they were going to try to frame me for theft.  So I was out of a 40 hour a week job, which was $285/week.  I learned that Wal-Mart is a really bad company to work for, and I might wish their employment on some of my enemies, but certainly not my friends.  This is the company that failed to train me for my job, then 3 weeks later hauled me in the manager's office to fire me for not doing my job.  Fortunately, I was able to talk myself out of that termination.  ("How do you expect me to do my job if, 1 - you don't train me, and 2- you're telling me that I'm doing perfectly fine?!")  While that is going on, I somehow manage to become friends with Jess, and we start dating.  Then I find God.  Actually, those two happened at about the same time, in a way.  After I finished working there I got hired to work at the Shaw's in Auburn, which was 40 miles away from Farmington.  Unfortunately, part time at a salary a buck over minimum wage doesn't do too much to pay rent or bills when gas is over $2/gallon  (Thank you, our "friends" in Saudi Arabia.  What was that about going to Iraq for the oil?)   About this time, my mom calls and mentions again that maybe I should move home.  I've been asking my relatives for money since November, and it's stretching them thin.  Now, what Momsiepoo has been going through is a lot, and she's thinking that if I move home, I could help her, and at the same time, try to financially recover.  Besides, Sanford, being in southern Maine, has more job opportunities.  And, if I want, I can bring Jess with me, she can be in my old room.  So I said yes.  On July 24th, I gave her the shock of her life when I arrived with all my stuff (trying to keep this G-rated).  Notice the title of the blog is "The Conservative Zone".  Yeah, I'm a conservative Republican, and I live in a household of liberal Democrats.  I can deal with this.  My best friends are liberals.  We have lively political discussions, too.  Except these folks aren't as friendly as my best friends are.  I've been told to simply not talk about what I believe.  Okay, to be fair, all it does is lead to heated argument, rather than debate, over here, so it's better off that way sometimes.  Then there's my aunt, who thinks she knows everything.  She has a dog, which she hasn't bothered to tame.  Yes, I said tame, because he wasn't trained from day one, and this dog randomly bites its owners, which means that the dog cannot be trusted.  If the dog cannot be trusted, it is essentially a wild dog, rather than a domestic pet.  This dog fails all parts of the personality test that animal shelters give to dogs before sending them for adoption.  And it stays over at my grandparents for their security.  Now, the first dog my aunt had, was trained as a guard dog, which normally would be a bad match for putting in a household with a 4 year old (me).  But this dog was protecting me, and he never ever bit me.  The dog she has now, as I mentioned, hasn't been trained, and has repeatedly bitten the people he's supposed to be protecting.   I really worry about my grandparents because of that dog, because of that.  I want him put down, and by rights, and by law, he should be, but my aunt and grandparents won't hear of it.  My aunt was asked why she didn't train her dog, and she said, "What for?"  How about  SO HE DOESN'T BITE YOUR PARENTS AND SISTERS AND NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND EVERYONE ELSE HE LOOKS AT, DIMWIT!!!   Anyhow, Ms. Brilliant and I had a conversation one time, that went like this: Me:  I have a degree and manager's experience, I shouldn't have to settle for a lousy part time, low paying job that requires no skill. Ms. Brilliant:  Well, Steve, you have to start at the bottom.  They don't know what kind of worker you are.  Recently, she got hired at a factory nearby, and the following conversation ensued. Ms. Brilliant:  I don't like the position I'm in right now.  It's not the one I got hired for, I should be doing better. Me:  Well, you've got to start at the bottom, so they know what kind of worker you are. Ms. Brilliant:  I know, but I have years of experience behind me. Me:  Oh, so my experience doesn't count, I understand.  Poor Jess was trying so hard to stifle her laughter.  Now, being aware of my part time, low paying position, the entire family, especially Ms. Brilliant, was telling me that I need to find a full time job.  "There's a lot to be said for full time jobs."  Well, duh!  Thank you, Captain Obvious!  All this time I was thinking having a low paying menial part time job was the way to go!  My lack of having a full time job is not because I haven't tried to find one.  In my recent attempts, I've discovered that you need teaching courses to teach driver's ed, as well as defensive driving courses.  And it's hard to get a hold of someone who leaves you 2 voicemail numbers.  And it's even harder to contact someone who doesn't leave you the correct number.  I can't juggle more than one job, I tried that once and had an adverse physical reaction which had my doctor scolding me.  It's just so frustrating, because I know I can do better, and I know that both my mom and fiancee are relying on me, and all I can manage to find right now is part time work at a low income.  The last think I need is for my aunt captain obvious to tell me I need a full time job, because "there's a lot to be said for full time jobs."  Yeah, thanks ... I needed to hear that for the hundredth time, and I needed to be reminded of the stress and pressures I have.  God will help me, I'm sure; either that, or teach me something.  Right now, I just want to make sure my mom and future wife are both taken care of.  Then maybe I'll treat myself to an ice cream.

						    The Dante's Inferno Test has sent you to  Purgatory!    You have escaped damnation and made it to Purgatory, a place where the dew of repentance washes off the stain of sin and girds the spirit with humility. Through contrition, confession, and satisfaction by works of righteousness, you must make your way up the mountain. As the sins are cleansed from your soul, you will be illuminated by the Sun of Divine Grace, and you will join other souls, smiling and happy, upon the summit of this mountain. Before long you will know the joys of Paradise as you ascend to the ethereal realm of Heaven.  Here is how you matched up against all the levels:       Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Extreme       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Low       Level 2   (Lustful)   Moderate       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Moderate       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Moderate       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Very Low       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       Level 7   (Violent)   Low       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Low       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Low        Take the  urlLink Dante's" Inferno Test

						   Has anyone here been in a situation where they've walked in a room after everyone's finished talking about them?  So, Andy, his 3 friends, and my mom are sitting in the living room talking about another friend of Andy's who's been supposedly hitting on his friends' girlfriends. Right after that, the poor guy walks in, and my mom says he's in it deep. Meanwhile, my fiancee is prepping some snacks. Andrewski and his friends proceed to  hide under a blanket  instead of face their friend. So my mom proceeds to start telling him to stop hitting on other people's girlfriends, and finally drags Andy and his friends from under the blanket. Now the poor guy has everyone yelling at him, so he takes off in a bad mood.  Okay, maybe it's not as funny reading it as what it was when it happened. But just the fact that Andy and his buds hid under the blanket right after they said they were going to say something is kind of amusing.

						   Well, I've wanted a blog for a while now except I didn't get one because I had a lot to say.  Except now, I have a blog and nothing to say.  Oh, sweet irony.  Well, now I've got the blog and I'll probably think of stuff to say later.  I moved back home with my fiancee and we're both living with my mom and spazomatic brother, so I doubt there's going to be a shortage of stuff for me to say.

						   Today I was scheduled at work in Bottles from 1:30 - 7, yesterday I was scheduled 12-6.  Apparently, they don't have a job name "Floater" so when someone who is a bottle clerk needs to be scheduled as a floater to bag, carryout, do bottles, or whatever, they schedule him for bottles on an odd shift (the normal shifts being 9-3 and 3-9).  So today I did everything - bagging, carryout, bottles, swept the store floor.  Just the regular "go around and get stuff done" guy.  I also found out that, just like when I first left Shaw's, the bottle clerk is expected to come to the front end and help whenever the front end needs help, but if the bottle clerk needs help finishing stuff up, he's SOL.  Ah well.  It's so frustrating though, having a college degree and being a bagger.  I'm not complaining or anything, just being honest.  Tomorrow I'll see if I can go to Kohl's and hand them my resume and see if they'll hire me when the store opens.  But I'd need more pay and more hours to justify leaving Shaw's for them.  Oh yeah, and a management position.  I probably had an opportunity at a small convenience store here, Provo's, but I got burned doing that before and I don't want to get burned again.  Not to mention, I don't think they'd provide any benefits.

						   Today, after eating out with my fiancee for our anniversary (9 months - or as Andrew would say, "montherversary"), I changed into my work clothes and went to work, where I realized that I had forgotten my nametag.  Now, Shaw's policy at work is that all associates  must  wear a nametag at  all  times.  Now, since I didn't have my nametag on me, after informing the front end assistant manager of the situation, she informed me that the service desk would provide me with one with a "silly name" on it.  Okay, "silly" is a word that can describe it.  The nametags were in blue, indicating that the names on them were fake.  I could be either "Wilbur" or "Truman" or "Delbert".  So I was "Delbert" for the day.  This made it fun for the other associates who didn't really know me yet, because they thought that was my real name.  So they asked me how to pronounce it, and I had to tell them "Steve".  They sounded surprised so I had to explain a few times that my name was Steven, and that the reason I had a nametag with "Delbert" on was because I had left my nametags at home.  While on register, I had a few people say that I was doing really well for someone in training, so I said that I had been on a register before, working for a convenience store and for Wal Mart, and that I really wouldn't wish either employers on anyone.  But the thing is, they thought they were talking to Delbert, not Steve.  But it was still me, Steve that they were talking to and dealing with.  Next time, I'm bringing my nametag.  And planting it on my forehead when I'm not working.  At least if I forget it, it will still be on.

						   A few weeks ago I changed my cell phone provider because US Cellular didn't have any local numbers for Sanford.  I went to Sam's Club and got a shared plan so Jessica and I could both have phones.  Yesterday I went to Sam's again because when I brought Jess to her parents in Lisbon, the cell phone displayed "ROAM", which at 49 cents a minute, is quite painful to have to pay.  So, I double checked the coverage area and where I would actually be paying roaming, and fortunately where we went to Lisbon is not in such an area.  That settled, I had Andrew pick out a phone, and he found a free one, and got a free faceplate with a flip cover on it, thus paying absolutely $0.00 nothing for a cool looking flip phone.  The twit.  I upgraded my plan while I was at it, so I have twice as many anytime minutes and 500 more phone to phone minutes, and Andrew is paying $30 to the cost of the plan (Jess and I are paying just as much), which is a lot better than $50/month for a halfway decent plan around here.  I have to admit I miss US Cellular.  Ah well.  Today I was training for cashiering, which involved a lot of paperwork and signing stuff, like papers saying that I wasn't going to steal and that if my register was messed up then I understood the store had the right to watch me.  Then we went downstairs and practiced on a register, there was a bit of laughing going on while people tried to portray difficult customers to whoever was ringing stuff up.  Oh yeah, I kind of feel bad for 'drewski's car predicament.  But, that's what you get for buying a FORD!!  =)
