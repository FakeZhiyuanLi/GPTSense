      I am just the empty, hollow shell of a man now.  I didn't know I could be this empty.  Every bit of sustenance has been emptied out of me...but that is too much detail.  Word of caution to everyone, never, I repeat, never put yourself in a position in which you have to take Fleet's Phosphorus; and if you ever do find yourself in that position, promise me you won't put yourself through the agony of the Ginger-Lemon flavored Fleet's Phosphorous.  It just isn't worth it.  But the worst part of this whole thing is that I really...really...really miss food.  The one thing I really want more than life giving oxygen right now is a large, Bazil's chicken parm sub, fresh from the oven...oh, now I've started drooling again.  Do you know how hard it is to watch eleven kids from 8:45 AM to 3:00 PM when you haven't had anything at all to eat...at all? Nothing but clear liquids and Jell-O.  Don't get me wrong...I could eat Jell-O and drink water all day if it wasn't for the fact that everywhere you turn, good, hot, appetizing food is being eaten.  I thought I would watch some TV to take my mind off the hole in my stomach, but did that help...NO!  It made it worse.  All I could think about today was Wendy's...Well, not officially (if you don't get this, get your nose out of that book and watch more TV!) because that stupid commercial is on every stinking break!  I'm going to cut this entry short today because I need to get up early tomorrow for the endoscopy and colonoscopy at Children's and I really don't think you want me to go into detail with what the medication is doing to my bowels.  So...leave me in peace!  Out

      Well, today was the first day of Camp Patoma, Junior Program, where I am the proud councilor for the eleven campers int he Green Group.  I have many of the same kids I had last year, but I also have a bunch of new meat...I mean kids.  Most of them are pretty good, well behaved, and listen to me.  But then there are those little brats who like to tick me off for the fun of it.  Usually I can deal with them, but the problem is that they seem to have a way of getting everyone else to start talking at the same time, too.  As you can see, the situation can quickly drop into chaos.  I'm so glad I got a CIT though to help me keep them under control.  He's a pretty good CIT too, but he tries a little to hard during games, which is a problem when you are dealing with little kids. They just can't jump as high or run as fast as someone like, say for instance...a CIT!Ah, oh well, you can only do so much.  One of the many highlights of today was Arts & Crafts, where the craft today was making Styrofoam gliders.  Well, not really making them really, more like coloring them in and then spending the rest of the time trying to figure out how to make the stupid things fly, or bother the councilor about how to get the stupid thing to fly...who is also trying to get the stupid thing to fly and not doing very well at it.  In the end though, I did figure out how to get it to fly and I'm pretty good at it too, if I do say myself, I I do.  But I think I was a little to good.  When I got home later on, I was flying the thing outside (because it is the coolest  thing ever!) and it was making a really good run too...right onto the roof.  You should have seen my face, the shear joy of watching the glider fly turn into pure horror as the glider banks and heads straight for the roof of my living room.  I cried like a baby who has just had his pasiflier run over by a car...or something like that.  Well, not even like that because I didn't really cry, but you know I was crying on the inside.  But the worst part was I didn't get any sympathy from my family.  Now, I know this is sounding like I'm whining...and I probably am...but if you had only seen it, you would have cried too.  On other highlight, then I'm done.  I would like to take this moment to brag about my superior archery skills.  I shot a bull's eye on my third shot today.  Yes, that's right, a bull's eye.  Lets see how many of you can do that.  Just as  a told my kids before, that's the last time your going to see that from me for the rest of the year.  Complete and utter luck.  Thank you for sharing that wonderful bragging moment with me, it makes me feel so special.  One more thing before I go.  Word of advice to all: Don't get up at 6:00 AM to go running...it just isn't worth it during the summer.  That's it for tonight...so go away...and no, you can't take the glider as a souvenir.  Out

      Sorry, for those of you who were dying to know how the work situation turned out (and I know there are a lot of out there), I finally resolved the conflict.  When I went into Brooks today for the fourth time in three days to check the schedule or talk with a manager...which ever comes first...and I noticed that my name was crossed out for this Wednesday, finally!  You can all breath again.  Out

      I would like to start off by saying that I was having a really bad day yesterday and if I happened to insult anyone, this is a general apology for everyone.  With that out of the way, lets continue...  Boy, do I hate mowing the grass.  After today, one would think that the entire lawn was covered in dog crap.  I think the mower must have ran over it about...a million times today.  Luckily, I have enough experience in these matters to avoid it all, though it was to close for comfort at times.  All in all, the lawn looks great now, if I do say so myself!  The one thing I like about mowing is the smell of freshly cut grass.  It ranks among my top three favorite smells (yeah, this a weird topic...deal with it).  My others would have to be lumber (you know, wood that has been cut) and gasoline.  This last one is kind of weird, but I really like the smell at the gas station when I pump gas (and you thought I couldn't get any stranger).  Later on today, I attended my sister's piano and voice recital, and I do have to say that some people should never sing...ever...for all of eternity.  Don't get me wrong, some people there were very good indeed, but others...no, absolutely no.  One thing that really gets on my nerves is people who think they can sing, brag about it, and in actuality, suck at it.  Don't you even hear yourself?  Boggles my mind.  I don't want to sound mean or anything (and I don't think I have because I didn't mention any names) but I think it had to be said.     I think it finally sunk in that its summer.  I took a really nice, long walk with my mom today around the neighborhood, well...not our neighborhood...but that doesn't really matter.  It was a nice none the less.  Then, when I got back, I spend an hour or two reading outside.  It was really, really nice...kind of buggy...but nice.  Then we ate outside for dinner, the first time this season, and it was again really, really nice.  I think I finally realize that it summer and I don't have to go to school!  Yippee!!  But that doesn't stop teachers from piling on the work, now does it?  I have four books to read for AP English. Oh, did I say books...I meant novels.  Yeah, that's right, novels.  Such classics as  Crime and Punishment  and  Brave New World  (which is incredible by the way...weird...but incredible).  Then, for AP Bio, I have read 7 or 8 chapters in the bio book.  If that doesn't sound like enough, the first three words of the summer assignment are, I quote, "Write a textbook."  Now, doesn't that sound fun?! Just let me enjoy my summer for crying out loud!    The best part of the day was after dinner.  I finally showed Europe pictures to my parents.  I went through Derek's pictures this time because they were all conveniently already on one CD (by the way, if anybody else for the Curboy Europe trip has pictures they would like to share and you have them on CD,  please  make me a copy.  My pictures came out really crappy and I have to use other people's now).  They really enjoyed it and asked a lot of good...and not so good...questions about the trip.  It felt so good to finally show those pictures and it really helped me to remember my trip.  Well, that brings the day to close and I have my first day of camp with those little brats...I mean...those little kids...shoot...tomorrow, so get off my property before I call the cops!  Out

      I really think the Brooks company is out to get me.  When I went in today to see who I could switch with, the only person that was available to work that time and still be able to switch with me has been erased off the schedule!  He even owes me one because I switched with him once.  Now I have no chance of getting that day off.  I really don't think they want me working that day anyway.  I would have to run to the bathroom about even...30 seconds because of the medications I have to take.  Oh, sorry, for those who don't know, I have to have both an endoscopy and a colonoscopy... AT THE SAME TIME!  The prep work I have to go through the day before the procedure has only one purpose, to clean out my system entirely.  This means no eating or drinking anything but clear fluids for that whole day.  The medication makes it so that all the food already in there comes out...as soon as possible.  Now, doesn't that just put a pretty picture into your head.  Then the next day, the day of the procedure, I have to have an IV in my arm.  Now, I am terrified of needles and I don't mind admitting it.  Apparently my parents thought it would calm my fears by telling me I would have an IV, but it didn't really help...at all.  Wow, those are going to be two fun filled days!  I'm kind of looking forward to camp, even though I have one of the worst kids in the entire world in my group first sessions...again.  This kid just does not know how to listen.  He is constantly doing the opposite of what you tell him to do and is always wandering off where he should be going.  Yeah, I know that sounds like a normal kid, but this kid does it more often and sometimes to just piss me off.  Oh well, it only for two weeks...two long weeks...two horribly long weeks.  Well, the night is still young and I'm off to see Dodgeball.  So...leave me alone.  Out

           Well, training was the order of the day today.  I had a staff meeting in the afternoon where we put together those god-awful folders we have to carry around everywhere.  What a waste of time...well...I do get paid...so...what a brilliant idea!  Then we had a barbecue for the staff afterward, which wasn't that bad, except for the fact that some other, not going to mention any names, were talking about drinking games during dinner.  Nothing makes me more awkward than people who drink talking about it.       At least I will get paid a little bit for this week.  My boss at Brooks is really starting to piss me off now.  She posted the damn schedule early again, apparently because she's going on vacation, but my reasoning tells me it was just to piss me off even more.  And boy did Jen, one of my other managers, get mad.  It was like she expected me to know that Linda, the manager I hate, was going on vacation...EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T WORKED FOR THREE WEEKS!...Sorry about that, I just had to get that out.  Wow, I really hate my job.       I saw the show "Straight Plan for the Gay Man" today adnn only two words come to mind...Absolutely Hilarious.  Just think Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, but Comedy Central style.  I highly recommend that show to everyone who likes to laugh...and if you don't like to laugh...go to hell...or somehing...       So...the carnival last night was fun.  I'm pretty proud of myself for going on the Satellite for the first time.  It wasn't bad at all.  Actually it was quite enjoyable, except for the fact that an extremely sharp piece of machinery was wiggling around right above us.  That didn't make me feel very safe...not at all.  That and the fact that they closed the Hurricane just after I had been on it due to technical problems...stupid carnies.       That about raps it up for tonight...so go away!  Out

      Today must be official "Beat Up on Dan Day" becuase I no longer have feeling in three of my limbs...well, that's streching it a bit...but only a bit.&nbsp; First off, having seven kids all on your back at the same time is just not fun, no matter what anyone tells you.&nbsp; Now, when you mix water and a football in with that, the results just aren't pretty.&nbsp; I think I got hit in the nose about four times and the eye about seven times, the stomach five times, the balls countless times, but those may not be the right numbers because I might have been unconscience at one time or another.&nbsp; I think the worst part of it was that one of the little brats...camper (damn, I did it again) had the never to say that I should be stronger like the life guards becuase they can catch the ball.&nbsp; Little did he know that the life guards didn't have any kiids hanging off of them while I had about...SEVEN ON MY BACK!...sorry, I needed to get that out.  To continue on witht he string of beatings, at karate I got beat up more than usual.&nbsp; Now, karate is all about beating people up...well, a little more than that, but you get the general idea...but I got&nbsp;an extra beating today.&nbsp; Its all becuase some shmuck has some pent up agression and doesn't like to listen to the rules very well.&nbsp; The rules were to make three&nbsp; hand attacks then back off.&nbsp; Only three attacks...then back off.&nbsp; Last time I checked sixteen wasn't the same as three, but that's how many times he came in and attacked me, in my face adding to yet even more facial injuries that are going to show up tomorrow.  Well, I'm cutting this short so I can go nurse my wounds, so leave me alone!  Out

      Session two started at camp today and I have to tell you, I think this group is going to be really good.  I am the only councilor without a CIT, but I don't really mind because the kids are GREAT!  Well, most of them anyways...there always one or two.  I think pone of them is going to switch groups because he feels he is too old for my group even though he was having a lot of fun today.  But in his place, I might be getting back two of my favorite kids in the entire camp so that is definitely a giant plus!  This session is really young as a whole, so the age I really like to work with is up two levels from what I have now, but as I said before, I really don't mind.  I have a good feeling about this session.  In other news, when I played my dad in Ace Combat 4 today, I beat him at least eight times.  No joke, he is really not that very good at it.  He just doesn't have the extensive training wasting his brain power on something so useless as videogames as I do.  Too bad...  Ummm, I can't really think of anything to say today, which is quite a surprise to me because I'm usually so full of useful and worldly knowledge and experiences to share with you all, but today I'm just drawing a blank.  Oh wait, before you go I just thought of something very interesting for all you history buffs out there, and maybe not history buffs who are just reading on because you have nothing better to do.  World War II in the Pacific did not actually end with the dropping of the second A-bomb on Nagasaki.  After the bomb was dropped, the emperor want to surrender to the Allies, but there was a coup that almost prevented him from doing so.  A lucky B-29 raid over Japan at the time of the coup forced a air-raid blackout that stalled the coup just long enough for a loyal part of the military to restore order and the emperor finally did unconditionally surrender.  Wow, now isn't that just incredible.  I know most of you couldn't give a care, but I thought it was interesting, so humor me.  Now I am completely empty of all relevant stories, so leave before I get angry, and you're not going to like me when I'm angry.  Out

      Wow, its been a while since I've posted anything.  I've just been so caught up in Rainbow Six 3 that I haven't had time to write by the time I finish for the night.  That, and the fact that camp has finally started to wear me out.  I don't know what happened, the kids just seemed to get more wild and more disrespectful as time went on and it was extremely bad around Tuesday of last week when I had a little...problem...with my kids, we'll just leave it at that.  Pat says its because they knew me better the second week, but my explanation is that our group didn't have a CIT the second week and that contributed to a loss of control.  Whatever it is, I do have to say that the kids showed their usefulness when we played the Yellow Team in Laser Tag on Wednesday.  Let's just say that it was a total massacre.  Our team completely wiped out the other team two games in a row...I'm just so proud!  Well, today, I made the easiest $30 of my life.  All I had to do was read a few lines and go through some blocking for my mom's friend's play that he wrote.  It wasn't the best play in the world...Actually, it wasn't even close...but who am I to complain now that I am thirty bucks richer.  I think I  must have played about five roles in the read through, but that isn't unusual for me...cough, MUD, cough.  This is where I get kind of out of order because I haven't written in such a long time: In karate on Saturday, I learned the coolest form, or part of the coolest form, ever.  It is a bow staff form that involves whirling the staff very fast around my head and bringing down with a satisfying crack on the opponent's head...three times.  You should have seen me trying to learn it.  I got so dizzy I had to sit down at one point to stop my head from spinning.  But it was all worth it.  If any of you have seen the beginning of it, and I know some of you have, I finally added to it and now its even better.  Last night I saw one of the funniest movies ever.  If you haven't seen A Mighty Wind, do yourself a favor and rent it.  If you have seen any of the Christopher Guest movies (Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, This is Spinal Tap) you really should seen this one.  Even if you haven't seen any of his movies and you have no idea what I'm talking about, you should still see it.  Get it now?  Its just that good.  Now back to today.  Tonight, my dad and I watched the Bourne Identity in anticipation for the Bourne Supremacy.  That is going to be such a kick ass movie I just can't even begin to explain.  Well, maybe I can...If the first one was as incredible as it was (and it was) then the second one is going to be just as good or better...and if it isn't...I will hunt down everyone involved in that movie and kill them Jason Bourne style...and you know I could too.  I'm so excited!  I think it comes out on the 23, but don;t quote me on that.  I'm going to try to see it as soon as it comes out.  If anyone cares to join me, you have to catch me first!  Well, that just about concludes our broadcast day, so leave me be!  Out

      Please, anyone who reads this, never...I repeat...never see the movie Bad Santa.  Don't ask why...just don't.  Now that we are past that happy note, I hope everyone enjoyed the rain today.  When I woke up this morning, I didn't think it was raining that hard, but boy was I wrong.  My car almost drowned when I was following my dad after picking up the rental car today.  Those puddles don't look dangerous, but that's how they get you.  They sneak right up on you, and then its too late!  And I still love the fastest setting for the windshield wipers.  That amount of speed is just not needed, but they are really funny to watch.  If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend it, its a hoot!  because it was raining today, I didn't really do much...well, that's not true.  I had a couple of really good rounds in  urlLink America's Army  this morning and some great rounds of  urlLink Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons  later on in the day.  I also was able to look at some college brochures that had been stacking up on my shelf.  The ones that I looked at today that look especially good were the ones in D.C. like American university, George Washington University, and Georgetown.  I especially liked Georgetown even though it will be extremely hard to get into, for me at least.  They seem to have everything there though, and its right in the city.  Wow, that would be nice.  My sister was pretty bored too today.  So bored in fact that she actually wanted to come with me when I went out for gas.  Talk about bored!  Oh, I guess you will want to know about my escapades down on the Cape on Saturday and Sunday.  Well...I'm not going to tell you, it's my business, not yours.  All I will say is that the fireworks were incredible this year...much better than in previous years.  The smiley faces were a nice touch, but I really enjoyed the ones with the red on top, blue on the bottom, and a white ring around the center.  I was also pleased to see the five-pointed star make its return after a long absence.  My only complaint was that the fireworks overlapped each other a lot.  I wish they would have more time in between or at least fire them at a wider angle so they don't interfere and you can enjoy each one.  I will leave you with this last note: Do yourself a favor and see Spiderman 2.  It just might be the best thing you do for yourself this summer.  If you don't see it, you will regret it for the rest of your life, and then some...its just that good.  Now go away before I get really angry!  Out

      I don't think I have ever sleep as much as I did last night.  I fell asleep around 7:45 PM and woke up sometime around 5:30 this morning.  I feel so rested now, and did I need it after yesterday.  At camp, we had a shaving cream fight witht eh kids and I'm still finding shaving cream in the most unusual spots today (don't get any dirty ideas). I wasn't able to hear for most of yesterday because I couldn't seem to get the shaving cream out of my ears...weird I tell ya.  Later on that day, for our councilor challenge, our task was to pick out Ju-Ju Bees (or whatever they are called) out of a pie tin covered with whip cream without using our hands.  I like whip cream as much as the next person, but not when its up your nose.  It has the worst smell ever when you have to breath it in and every time I inhaled, more of it would be pushed farther back into my nose.  Not the most pleasant thing ever.  Let's just say that at the end of the day I really needed a shower to get the thin layer of shaving cream, whip cream, and lake water off of me.  Later on that day, Pat and I shared some Dew and chips and played videogames all afternoon, one of my favorite past times.  If you ever have a chance to try Guacamole  urlLink Doritos , don't pass the opportunity up...they are great!  And if you are into videogames, especially war games, you really should try out  urlLink Full Spectrum Warrior , it is a really fun game!  Then we played a mission or two in Ghost Recon and we kicked some major Georgian butt.  We retook T'Blisi and saved the American embassy from certain destruction.  Yeah, that's right...we are heroes, no need for thanks and gratitude, just money will do.  Ghost Recon, now that's another game you wargamers out there should try if you want some real Spec Op fun.  And here's some  urlLink fun  for the rest of you (just click the link on "fun").  Well, I'm going to be on the Cape for the Fourth and should be back early Monday.  If any of you are going to be near Falmouth this weekend, just give my cell a call (if you don't know the number, then I'm not going to tell you) and maybe I'll see you there!  But for now, I have to finish packing and doing stupid chores...so, make like a tree, and get out of hear!  Out

      I feel so violated!  Today was the day that shall for ever be know as the day where I had two cameras stuck up me.  And they couldn't even find everything they were looking for!  That mean I might have to go through all this fun and games all over again!  Hooray!  But I don't want to be greedy and hog all the fun, so if anybody else wants to take my place next time...feel free to do so.  The IV wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, me hating needles and all.  My one complaint though is that the nurse had really...really bad aim.  When she stuck the needle (gulp!)in the first time, I was ready for it and it wasn't that bad.  But then she proceeded to move it around in there, apparently looking for the vein.  Then she slid the needle almost all the way out and slid it back in again.  Then some more wiggling and some more sliding until she finally found the vein.  If this doesn't sound bad in writing, imagine how it was to watch it in your own arm...not so pleasant.  But I can't really complain because this was a small price to pay for them putting something nice into my arm that prevented me from having to deal with other, worse pain.  After the procedure, I have to tell you that I have only been that relaxed a few times before.  It really nice just lying there in the hospital on those nice beds with the medication still in your system.  I think I might have dozed off a few times here and there.  But then when I was finally mostly conscience, I got to ride in a wheelchair.  This was just my lucky day!  Nothing like being pushed around a big building like Children's and having everybody move out of your way.  Oh, and another thing.  I don't think I've ever missed food as much as I did today.  I hadn't had food to close to 44 hours and I was really starting to feel it after the procedure.  But on our way home, my mom stopped by a Dunkin' Donuts and I ate my first food in almost two days.  And let me tell you, that food didn't last two seconds, I went through it that fast.  It was like feeding time at the zoo, or at least I zoo where the animals aren't fed very much.  The rest of the day was mostly spent on the couch, in and out of conscienceness, trying to let the medication out of my system.  Its not the easiest thing to walk around after the sedate you.  So, I would have to conclude that today, except for the crazy IV, would have to rank among my top relaxing days.  Well, I have to let the rest of this medication get out before work tomorrow, so get out of here before I get my shotgun!  Out

      My God, I saw the Bourne Supremacy for the second time today with my dad tonight. And let me tell you, its was incredible the second time too! If you have not seen the first Bourne movie, the Bourne Identity, do yourself a big favor and watch it, you will not be sorry...that's a guarantee . And if you have seen the Bourne Identity, you have to see the Bourne Supremacy. It is equal, if not better than the first one...with the best car chase I have ever seen. I could rant for hours, but that would kill most of you, so I'll stop. But if you still need further convincing, the Supremacy makes you question a lot of things about the first movie...in a good way...  I apologize for not writing more often. Camp is very busy and sucks the energy right out of me. I usually end up falling asleep pretty early...that or I play one of my new PS2 games into the wee hours of the night. The games of which I speak are Rainbow Six 3 and Ghost second: Jungle Storm. Both are pretty good games but they both suffer from AI that is just not to par, especially Jungle Storm. I had a sniper gunned down from a tango standing next to him and the rest of the snipers team didn't do anything about it. Well, maybe they didn't really like the guy...that would sort of explain it...I guess. If you haven't tried Rainbow Six 3 though, I highly suggest renting it and playing around. It is mighty fun.  Because I haven't written in a while, I going to start with the most recent events and work backwards. This could get confusing, but we'll give it a go anyway.  I also saw the movie Paycheck tonight. I have to say that it wasn't bad, but after just watching the Bourne Supremacy, I was very disappointed. If you like a good action movie, you should check it out, but it isn't special. You don't have to run out and get it this instant, and that would be hard because I'm writing this pretty late and the rental stores probably aren't open now anyway. Oops, off subject there for a second...wait for it...OK, now I'm back!  Well, to continue of the "today" subject, I also went to the beach with Patrick and his family. Well, going to the beach was our plan and we tried our hardest to get in, but it was full and they turned us around after we waited in line for twenty minutes! They could have just told us at the end of the line that the beach was full and we wouldn't have had to wait in in that STUPID LINE! AHHHHHHHHH! Anger...Subsiding. Rage...Under control. Whew, that was a close call. We did end up kind of hanging around near the ocean in Gloucster and found a small beach area. It was really rocky there, but it was fun to go swimming in the ocean. There is nothing quite like swimming in freezing cold water to get the blood moving. I had a really good chili dog, too.  OK, I bet you're all dying to know about my third and last session of camp. Well, let's just say its been...interesting. For starters, I have a kid who thinks that he is Harry Potter. He thinks this so much that he always talks with an incredibly fake British accent. If you're going to pretend you're British, at least have a decent accent if you're going to use it all the time. And to make things worse, the kid always has to have what he wants. For example, he wanted us to change the entire schedule and all our classes because he was bored after the first day. When we told him that that was impossible and that he should kiss our collective ass (well, maybe we didn't say that last part), the kid took off into the woods. I had to chase him through the paths a good distance up the hill. To tell you the truth, it really wasn't that hard because the kid really does know how to run. I laugh pretty hard every time I see him attempt to run...yeah I know that's really mean, but its the truth, so deal with it. To make a longish story short...ish...we ended up calling the kid's mom and kicked him out of camp for the day which in turn made my day all the brighter!  Camp has been going really well so far. I love my kids so much, even if they do drive me INSANE. They will do anything for me, short of actually listening to me so I can get them to archery on time. They will give me small pieces of their lunch without me saying a word and when we go to Roll on America, they will give me tokens so I can play with them in some game. Ah, now I'm all vaclempted. Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a subject: The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, Roman, nor an empire...discuss!  Wow, don't know where that came from...Now that I'm back to my normal self (whatever that is) I can tell you about the LBD we had at camp on Friday. For those of you who don't know what an LBD is, listen up. LBD stands for   L  out   B  ather   D  rill     and is enacted whenever there is a kid we can't find who was last seen near the water. Now, up to this point, it had always been casual, well, not really casual, but you get what I'm saying. It had always been done after camp with no kids around and we were always prepared for it when it happened. But this one was different. In the middle of lunch at camp, we all hear the air horn (the signal for a Lost Bather) go off. I got up and ran towards the lifeguard shack to check on what was wrong and get a description of the kid. I never got that far. Ig got a description from Ryan as he was running to the bathrooms to check for a Kevin last seen wearing blue shorts. So I sprint over to the fields to check over there. The fields are all clear, so I spring back over the water. I don't think I have ever ran that fast in my life and as I learned from campers, who were watching the whole thing from the Nukem court, that was like a blur I was running so fast. At the water, I ran into the lake where I linked arms with the other counselor where we would rake the lake with our feet to try to find the kid in the water. Now, at this point, none of us knew whether this was a drill or the real thing. We made about five sweeps of the swimming area before we finally moved beyond the ropes and started to sweep the other sections of the lake. At that point, we were all call out of the water and up onto the beach. Lifeguards and counselors were crying left and right. We were all told to sit down while the head guard ran over to check on what was going on. He came back and told us it was all a drill. You cannot believe the relief we all felt when we heard that. People were really shaken up after that exercise. But I was really surprised with myself. I was not effected at all, not even a little bit. I was so focused on our task at hand, finding the kid, that no other emotions or thoughts took over. I was sure that I would have felt something afterward, but there was still nothing. Very strange indeed.  A lot of people were angry that we were put through that, but I think it was one of the best things I have ever done. I showed exactly how I would react in a really life emergency, and I was extremely happy with my results. I was also extremely pleased with the actions and reactions of my fellow staff members. We were perfect in that situation. We made no blunders or mistakes and if there had been a kid in the water, we would have definitely found him or her before significant brain damage appeared. Again, I am extremely happy with how both I behaved and how the staff reacted to the situation.  Wow, I'm glad I got all that off my chest, it was starting to get really heavy. Well, typing all of that tired me out for the night and off to bed. So go away and leave me be.  Out
