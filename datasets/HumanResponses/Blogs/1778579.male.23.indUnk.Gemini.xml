      without the jukebox. The jukebox that Elaine said would "...win the prize for the worst selection of songs." Oh, but me made do. There really is not much that can top eating pizza with friends and listening to "www.memory" by Alan Jackson. Let's see, there were nine of us there: Ben, Elaine, Chalupa, Rupp, TLoft, Ben, Lydia, Tim, and I. The pizza was good too. We got three larges, and the guy confused the cheese one with the pepperoni one, so at first there was a mad rush for the "pepperoni" one, forcing those who wanted only cheese to resort to scraping meat from the other pizzas.  Even the drive was fun. The place is about 25 minutes away, so we rocked out to 80's songs in the car, yelling the words at the tops of our lungs and playing highway games with the cars around us.  Overall, it was a great reunion of friends, and if we were all vets from 'Nam we probably would have talked about war memories, but we're not, so we didn't.

      "Won't be long before the kids return." I hear it all the time. Taylor University will re-commence classes in just over two weeks. The "kids" talked about here are the college students. And I'm one of them. Interestingly enough, I find myself saying the same thing. "The kids will be back soon." As a 22 year old senior who took a year off before coming to school, I guess I am now one of the oldest ones here, but still. When will we grow up? Is there a point in life when we will stop being kids, or stop looking on those a bit younger than us as kids?  Probably not. Parents say to their youngest, "You'll always be our baby." And I guess that's the way life goes. To someone, somewhere, I'm young by comparison. You are too. I think that's a good thing. Take it to heart, we all need to be something of a kid sometimes.  A speck of life is lost when someone grows up too much to have a sense of humor. Will you be a kid today?

      because I talked to my Dad on the phone. It's his birthday, you know. He's 56 now. And that's not all - he lives in Cameroon. Hold on though, it gets even better. I called a cell phone that he has been carrying around for while now but he has never made or received a phone call on it up until now. He told me it was a great first call to receive.  I sent him an email last night (with the time change he got it on the correct day), jokingly asking him how it feels to be 39.  He sent back an email saying I was off by a year - 39 is NEXT year. He brought it up on the phone and I jokingly acted embarrassed and said I hoped I didn't make him feel too old. We had a good private little laugh.  I talked to my dad on the phone today, so now I can smile.

      What is the job of a computer security expert? Is it not to keep the computers on their network SECURE from viruses and worms by applying security patches? So what is really going on in a company that gets totally shut down by the latest computer worm? You would think that having three weeks of advance notice before a new worm comes out would be enough time to apply the fix that came with the notice. But apparently it's not. The coffee must just be too appealing, the conversations too involving to actually get work done at work.  No wonder people are having to work longer hours more days per week. Alas, such is life.  The funny part is that the Blaster Worm is going to attack the Windows Update site on Saturday...

      Another semester is over. I have now been at Taylor for 3.5 years. Where does the time go? All I have left is j-term and second semester, and then...  Well, that's the problem. I have no idea what I'll be doing or even where I'll be come June. Kinda scary, but kind of exciting to know that it'll be a fresh start.  Tomorrow I head down to Indy, and then from there Andrew and I will be heading out to Massachusetts to spend the holidays with Abby and Dan. Should be a good time. It'll be a good change of scenery, that much is certain. But just like time does, it will pass and I'll be back here once more.  That'll be good too though. I'm beginning to realize the importance of relationships, and I will try not to take the rest of the time I have here for granted. Oh, if only I had figured that out sooner! Anyways, I have friends I need to get in touch with and no one ever reads this anyhow, so I'll stop.

      And this time I think I might try to keep it that way for a bit...  It was actually a pretty tricky problem, due to the fact the IE has a terrible rendering engine. It just goes to show that Microsoft thinks it's too good to be standards compliant. As a matter of fact, you should try using a different browser. In my opinion,  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  is the best browser out there, and it is much more standards compliant than IE is. Not only that, but it has built-in popup blocking, tabbed browsing, and oh so much more. So get it. Now.  Enough of one rant, time for another. Thanks to our IT department here at Taylor, I had to reinstall everything (including windows) on my computer last night. They thought it would be good to do a forcible install of their corporate anti-virus software (Symantec) on all computers joined to the domain, over the network. Well, I was running Norton Anti-Virus at the time, and Symantec makes it clear on their website that the two products can have devastating results if run together. Such was the position IT put me in. I couldn't even boot Windows into Safe Mode because my computer was so screwed up. Well, now I've disabled all Administrative shares that they took advantage of to accomplish this, so I should be safe now.  Woohoo for IT doing stupid things.

      My prayer is that this movie would be a huge witness for Jesus Christ, and that non-Christians and Christians alike would realize what Jesus endured for us. I believe that the movie has the capability of making a huge difference in our world, and I pray that all of Satan's attempts to lessen the impact of the movie will fail.  I'm going to see it at 10:20 tonight, along with some 600 other Taylor students. I'm excited, anxious, nervous - all at the same time. So in the mean time, seeing as I can't get it out of my head anyhow, I figured I'd mention it here. You should go, and take a friend along.

      Here I am sitting in my room, and I should be doing homework. But, I'm not. There's only so much I can do at once. Right now I've been working on my re-vamped  urlLink website , finally updating this blog, talking to friends on IM, and thinking about life. And there's still so much I need to do. I need to find a job for when I graduate in May, for instance. I could be working on projects for classes. I should probably be sleeping. Oh well. I guess with my plate so full all I can do is keep on eating.

      Well, I am halfway through my last semester in college. We've had seven weeks, we have seven more. Well, eight if count finals, but they don't really count. Time just keeps on moving. Spring break is over now and classes start tomorrow. Let's see, did I get done what I wanted to over break? Hmmm. Project for class? Check. Work on my website? Check. Find a job for after graduation? Still looking....  Have I mentioned how hard it is to find a job in the Dallas area when I'm up in Indiana? Yeah, not having much luck. Hopefully something will come up in say, oh, the next eight weeks or so! Other than the need to find a job, things are going well. I've been more in contact recently with friends from Cameroon / Massachusetts than I have been in a long time.  So things are good. Now I just need a girlfriend...

      After spending the first half of the week down in Indy, I came back up to Upland on Wednesday. After putting of my project even more, I finally sat down and worked on it today. Started before lunch and worked pretty much until supper time. The good thing is, the project is pretty much done! I still need to come up with some thorough tests for it, but it's basically there.  Not only that, I put my resume in at a place in Indy in case something doesn't come up right away, and hopefully that will give me something to fall back on. I haven't heard from them yet, but I have a couple of friends from Taylor who work there so chances are a lot higher there than other places. So we'll see...  Tonight I spent the evening with a friend watching the Xavier/Texas March Madness game. It's amazing to me how I can get into sports so much when I don't even really care about the teams that are playing. Xavier being the underdog, we chose to cheer for them, and it was a close game the whole way. By the end I was standing up five feet from the TV with white knuckles. Xavier played hard and ended up with the win.  One other thing - Happy Birthday Karyn! Hope it was a special day for you!

      and it feels really good. Right now I'm at Andrew's place, and all he has is a dial-up connection. Not only that, but he has a laptop and he takes it with him to work. I brought my computer with me, but I don't have a modem. Doh! So during the day, there really isn't all that much I CAN be doing.  Rather than feel like I'm wasting a full week sitting around disconnected from the world, I've decided to only stay down here in Indy through Tuesday. On Wednesday I'll head back up to Upland and stay with a friend off campus for the rest of the week. He has a cable modem, so I can hook into that and once again get some stuff done.  To Do (once I'm back in Upland): * Finish my Java project for Language Structures * Work on my website * Keep looking for a job in the Dallas area

      Well, it's spring break. I really should be more excited than I am right now. But that's ok. It's 1:30 in the morning, and I got a lot of packing done tonight. So many people asked me today if I was moving out or something because they saw me packing up almost all of my stuff.  So...here's the explanation for all who want to know:  I'm graduating in May. One of my best friends is coming to my graduation, and leaving here with me to drive down to Indy. Seeing as I have quite a bit of stuff, I'm taking as much of it as I can down to my brother's house over break, so that I will have only what I need for the rest of the year left up here. That way at the end of the year I will be able to fit Adam, me, my stuff, AND his stuff all in my little car. Otherwise I would have to leave more stuff behind.  So no, I'm not moving out, I'm just thinking ahead.  The end.

      Let's see - it's Tuesday night. Spring break is next week, and I have oh so much to do before the end of the week. A project for Operating Systems consisting of adding a function to the kernel. My partner and I have a good start, but we're stuck at the moment so it'll have to wait until after we can ask our questions tomorrow in class. In Language Structures I have to create an interpreter for a language called "Jay". A lot of code is given to us to get us going, but I still haven't started the part I have to do. Doh. Both projects are due Friday. Oh yeah, I also have a test on Friday.  Not to mention things apart from school. Seeing as I'll be done here in May and I have to take all my stuff from this place to the next is my little car, I also need to pack up a bunch of stuff and take it down to my brother's place over spring break. That way, all I'll have left here are things I need for the rest of the year, and space won't be as much of a problem.  Tomorrow I will hopefully get my car fixed. We found out it has a leaking brake cylinder, and I don't really feel like driving down to Indy before getting it fixed. I'm getting help from a friend, and I don't think he'll charge me too much for the labor. I already bought the part - it was only $12. Hopefully that will fix the problem.  So what am I doing? Talking on IM and procrastinating! Obviously.

      Prayer and Praise with IWU (another local Christian college) had just gotten out and I was heading back to my room. As I was approaching my door, I heard a phone ringing, and it seemed to be coming from my room. Odd, I thought. My phone doesn't normally ring. But, it's Sunday, so maybe Abby is calling.  Much to my surprise, it was a friend from back in Massachusetts. Now granted, we send emails back and forth, and talk on Instant Messenger now and again, but a phone call was a wonderful surprise. Karyn is one of the few people that I actually keep in touch with from my time in MA, one of the few that actually took the effort to make sure I was still alive over the past few years even though I'm horrible at returning the favor.  So here we were on the phone, and it was just neat. We caught up a bit more on life, remembered old times, and just had an overall good conversation.  Thank you God for all your blessings on me!

      because I got a snake! It's a Columbian Red Tail Boa, and it's awesome. It's only 2-3 months old, and I've had it 10 days now. It's still really small - only about 2 feet long. I'm not sure if it's a male or a female, but at this point that doesn't really matter. I can find out later.  It hasn't eaten yet, but that should come with time. Someone on a forum suggested leaving it alone for a couple of weeks to let it get acclimated to its new home. Won't be easy to do, but I guess I'll try. I think I don't quite have it warm enough either, so I'm gonna try to get a heat pad as soon as I can. I've been told not to worry though. Time is all it needs.  I still need to come up with a name though, so let me know if you have any brilliant ideas!

      Today in chapel I heard a really good message about returning to my first love, Jesus Christ. It was a call to refocus on what is really important - my relationship with Jesus Christ. If the relationship is there, everything else will follow. The speaker spoke from Revelation 2, where John addresses the Church in Ephesus. The Church is commended for living upright and holy lives, rejecting evil. They are condemned, however, for forsaking their first love.  This was used to show that striving to be holy should not be our main focus. We need to focus on our relationship with Jesus. Keep doing what you're doing, but make sure the priorities are correct.  And on another note...   Hebrews 3:12-13   "See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

      I'm more in contact with friends than I have been in a long time. Things are going really well, and yet I have such a poor outlook on life. I'm constantly thinking that none of my plans will work out in the end. I have this fear that I'll end up a single and alone, living a pointless life of going to work and coming home to nothing.  I have so many blessings in my life. I've gone to a great Christian school for the past four years, and I'm leaving with a good education. I have an awesome family, and friends that really care about me. I have Jesus Christ. I had an incredible experience growing up in Africa. I talk to friends on the phone for hours and it's awesome.  Even things for next year a looking good. I don't have a job lined up, but I'm hoping to be near my best friend - and we haven't lived near each other for the past five years. What more could I really want?  Why do I feel the way I do?

      But it's not, and it never will be. I try to look on things with a good attitude, but it's not always easy. I'm here at Taylor almost done, and I'm totally mixed about leaving. I can't believe that my life as I have known it (non-stop education) is coming to an end - and I'm super excited about that. But it means I have to say bye to people too. And that's never easy.  I feel that as I leave this place I should have some sort of direction for my life. But I'm just floating right now. I'm about to turn 23, I'm single, I don't have a job or a definite place to live. My friends live in either direction across the country and talking on the phone every now and again just isn't enough to make it feel as though they're here with me.  It's a time of change and transition and decision making, and every choice I make closes off a hundred other possibilities. Which is the path for me?  The Road Not Taken ~Robert Frost  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;   Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,   And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.   I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

      So here I am, sitting down in the dungeon (the CSS dept. here at Taylor), waiting for my 2:00 lab to start. Right now I'm listening to Linkin Park, Reanimation. It's a neat album.  My ankle: It's getting better slowly. The color is fading now, and I'm walking around fine. It's still tender and it hurts when I stretch it, but there is definite improvement. It was a pretty bad sprain - it turned purple from my foot to a third of the way up my leg. A word of advice...try to not land on a basketball next time you're out shooting around...  School: Things are starting to wind down. I have a total of four more projects and three chem labs. One of the projects is coming along well, and we'll keep banging away on it tonight. One of my labs is today, so come the end of the week, I'll have three projects and two labs left. Not to mention only four more weeks of school. Wow.  Job: I don't have a job lined up, but I'm not too anxious about it. My parents will be in the states for about a month this summer, and mid-July we are heading down to Dallas for a wedding. The more that I think about it, I think it would be good for me to spend some time with my parents. So I'm considering hanging out with them, going down to the wedding, and staying in Dallas after the wedding. Seems like an ideal time for me to move. If I don't have a job lined up at that point, at least I'll be in the area trying to find a job instead of from a distance.  Chip: Five weeks from graduation, and he just started dating a freshman here. We'll see how that goes...

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am just a-drownin' in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  And everything seems cut and dried, Day and night, earth and sky, Somehow I just don't believe it  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Bought a ticket for a runaway train Like a madman laughing at the rain A little out of touch, a little insane It's just easier than dealing with the pain  Runaway train, never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Runaway train, never coming back Runaway train, tearing up the track Runaway train, burning in my veins I run away but it always seems the same

      Spring Break is over. Easter Break is over. We are now in the final stretch. No more breaks. Just five weeks of classes, four days of finals, and then graduation.  Time is flying.  I'm ready to go. Rather than look at this last little stretch as something I don't want to do, I'm trying my best to take advantage of the time I have left here. So many people that I may never see again.

      So after having complained about my  left  foot yesterday, this is what happens today. A friend and I went to the gym to shoot around and the ball got wedged between the rim and the backboard. After running, jumping, and hitting the ball a number of times it was still wedged securely in its place. A couple other guys were on the other end of the court also shooting around, and seeing our dilemma, they rolled their ball toward us so we could use it to knock our ball back down. Problem is, I was still in the jumping process...  One of the guys yelled "Ball!" to warn me, but it was too late. I came down on the ball with my right foot, and as the ball rolled under my weight, so did my ankle. Needless to say, I lay on the floor for a few minutes in pain before braving the standing up process.  All said and done, I've rolled my ankle worse in the past and it got better then, so I'm pretty sure it'll get better this time too. Funny thing is, my  left  foot hurts because I've been playing sports regularly, so now that my  right  ankle is trashed I won't be playing sports, so my  left  foot should get better...  It's an interesting world.  And now I'm off to bowling, where I hope my ankle doesn't interfere too much...

      Ok, so this is what happened. Three years ago I was riding my bike to work and this idiot in a Jeep Grand Cherokee backed out from a little corner convenience store without looking both directions. To avoid being hit, I turned my handlebars all the way to the right to veer around him. Due to attempting such a sharp turn, I was about to fall over, so I put my left foot on the ground to stop myself.  Well, I didn't fall over, and the guy didn't hit me full out, but his front left wheel (engine end of the vehicle, mind you) thumped over my left foot. Being stupid like I am, I put off going to the doctor even though my foot was killing me. I limped around for a month or so before it felt somewhat better, but even then it still hurt most of the time. Finally around two months after the incident, I went to get it checked out.  At that point it was too late to tell from the x-ray what had happened, so the doctor just supposed that my foot had been pretty much flattened against the road, stretching things that aren't meant to be stretched and possibly breaking things. Well, he gave me an arch brace and told me to wear it for a while. I'm not sure that it really helped at all.  Well now, almost three years later, it's really been hurting again. I find myself limping as I walk around campus. I can't pinpoint the pain, it's just somewhere  inside  my foot. Dang it. Why didn't I just go to the doctor when it happened??? So really, it's not my foot that is stupid, but me.  Well, hopefully it will just go away and get better. Somehow I doubt it.

      I'm really looking forward to getting out of this place. As much as I'll miss some of the people here, I can't wait to be done. A fresh start somewhere new with new people will be good. I have no clue what I'll be doing, but at least it won't be what I'm doing now. Every day now is just like the last, and it's really starting to drain me.  Classes - well, I hate school. I always have. High school, college, whatever. Sure it's nice being around people my age and hanging out, but I despise doing work for classes. And I don't really hang out anyway. I pretty much just sit around in my room. I have six projects left between two classes, and four labs left in chemistry. I have absolutely no motivation to do them, but I will, just like always.  Things will be fine, I just needed to share some of my apatheticism with you all. Maybe tomorrow will be better, but this is how I feel right now. I don't care and I just want to be done.

      I walked out of the dorm the other day and who should walk by but the president of Taylor University, Dr. Gyertson. He gave me a big smile and asked how I was. I responded with the typical, "Things are going well, how about you?" At this point he said the most interesting thing - "Spring is sprung, the grass is ris." By the time he had finished saying it, we were already past eachother, already moving back into our own busy worlds. But somehow, what he said has stuck with me. It makes me smile and almost chuckle each time I think about it.  And oh how thankful I am that spring has finally arrived. The grass is green once again and birds have resumed their songs. The weather is warming, if still too slowly for my likes, but it is warming none-the less.  On another note, I got to play volleyball yesterday, and get to play again later today! I've worked with the women's volleyball team here since I was a freshman, doing line judging and scoreboard / substitutions. During the spring, the girls call out six or so guys to scrimmage with them, give them a challenge. I happen to be one of the few to get called, and it is always a blast. Volleyball is most definitely my favorite sport, as long as it is competitive.  And now I'm off to other things.

      I'm sitting at Nathan's place, writing one last post before I head out. For the next week I will be fairly disconnected - no internet connection.  From here I am heading down to Indy to hang with my brother, and then I am heading out to MA on Friday. I'm totally excited about getting out there, but I'm not looking forward to the drive and I still don't have a job...  So my life is in God's hands. I may not know, but he does:  Jeremiah 29:11 "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the LORD, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."

      When the rain comes it seems that everyone has gone away When the night falls you wonder if you shouldn't find someplace To run and hide Escape the pain But hiding's such a lonely thing to do  I can't stop the rain From falling down on you again I can't stop the rain But I will hold you 'til it goes away  When the rain comes you blame it on the things that you have done When the storm fades you know that rain must fall on everyone So Rest awhile It'll be alright No one loves you like I do  I can't stop the rain From falling down on you again I can't stop the rain But I will hold you  I can't stop the rain From falling down on you again I can't stop the rain But I will hold you 'til it goes away  When the rain comes I will hold you

      Nathan just left for PA. He won't be back till Monday, but I'll be gone from here tomorrow, so I won't see him again. He's been a great friend the past few years.  And just for his sake, a quote from Dumb and Dumber....  "I hate goodbyes!!!"  Well, maybe I'll see him again before too long. Never know.

      Well, I'm sitting here with absolutely nothing clever, funny, or even interesting.  One thing I can say is that Linkin Park's Meteora album is as dismal as it ever was. If you want some real good low down 'I hate my life' kind of music, it's a good choice. I think they must have had some serious issues when they wrote that album.

      I was just looking at quotes of the day online, and this is the first one I found:  "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed."  - Alexander Pope  It's interesting because I just posted about expectations a few minutes ago, and I was talking with my sister about disappointment just the other night. I was telling her that I just take life as it comes to me, and I try not to let things get me down too much. I said that maybe it's because I have somewhat of a pessimistic view of life, so when things don't work out I get up and move on. I prepare myself for the worst, and then when it happens it doesn't hurt as badly. When I said that, she told me that had nothing to do with pessimism, but that I look on life realistically. Sure it's good to hope for the best, but in reality sometimes things don't work out - and that's ok.  It's almost like being a Christian: Pray as if it all depends on God (because it does), but work as if it all depends on you.

      I've been thinking over the past few days, and I've decided that while assumptions lead to problems, expectations do not.  It is wrong to assume something about someone else, especially to the point of making decisions based on that assumption. This comes to mind in relation to emotions, and it makes me think of Proverbs 4:23, "Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life."  On the other hand, if you  know  something, and there are no assumptions overlying the issue, it is altogether proper to have expectations. Expectations are things that you  are able "to consider probable or certain," according to Merriam-Webster Online. When you base things on what you  know  rather than what you  assume , you are approaching the issue correctly.  And that was just something I've been thinking about.

      I have successfully completed my time in school at Taylor University.  Graduation weekend was a blast. Thank you so much for travelling out here Adam and Karyn, even though plans didn't come together until the last minute! And thank you Aron and Amy for driving out here as well.  Graduation day was beautiful. Due to the nice weather, graduation was held outside in the football stadium, so there was plenty of seating. Adam, Karyn, Kelly, Andrew, Aron and Amy, as well as most of the Yoder clan were there to see me walk across the stage. From there we went out to eat at Ivanhoes, and after that Adam, Karyn, Kelly and I drove down to Indy. We met up with Andrew and the five of us had a fun time hanging out for the afternoon and watching a movie at Andrew's place that night.  Sunday was full of goodbyes as Adam and Karyn flew separate directions, and Kelly was supposed to but got delayed. She ended up flying out just after lunch today.  So now I am back up at Taylor, where I will be working through Friday. From here I will spend a few days with Andrew down in Indy, and then I'm off to MA...

      As plans often do, plans changed. My friends from Massachusetts who have been planning on driving out here for my graduation just decided last night that they're not going to after all.  All but one: Karyn is still coming! She decided to fly instead of drive, which in my opinion is a much better idea anyhow. So she'll fly into Indy tomorrow around noon, and then she'll fly out again on Sunday afternoon. I'm so amazed that she's still coming out here even though the others decided the trip wasn't practical (and time off work was not easy to come by, apparently).  It worked out really well because Andrew (who lives in Indy) is driving up here tomorrow afternoon, so he's going to pick her up at the airport before he comes up. Then on Sunday, I'm already making a couple of trips to the airport, and so it works out perfectly.  In other news: I'M DONE WITH COLLEGE!!!!

      Adam has arrived safely. He flew into Indy last night around 7:40, I picked him up around 7:55, and after a stop for food we arrived back up at Taylor around 9:35. In the car on the way back here from the airport, we realized that it's been 11 months since we saw eachother last, but now that we're together it feels like it was just last month. It's incredible how good friendships aren't lost due to time and distance. Out of sight out of mind is not always the case after all...  It's really cool to have him around, and to let him see where I've been living for the past 4 years. It's crazy because he was denied leave two times before finally having it approved on the third try. So at first it was looking like he was coming, then it was looking like he wasn't. When he finally told me he had gotten leave, I still didn't get my hopes too high - I was waiting till he stepped off the plane and was here in Indiana.  Well, now he's here. And the rest of my family / friends will get here on Friday. It's an exciting time, and yet I'm still sad about leaving this place.  And the rest of you, I CAN'T WAIT for you to get here! :-)

      Well, I had to do one last check, but I appear to be safe. It turns out that if I don't show up to any of my finals I will still pass all of my classes. Now that doesn't mean that I won't show up, or that I won't study, but it means I really don't have to worry about anything. My graduation is secure.  Tonight Adam flies into Indy. He'll be getting in around 7:40, so I'll be heading down that direction around 6:30. That should give him enough time to get his baggage and hopefully be waiting outside so I just have to drive up. If he's not there yet, I guess I'll dish out the cash for parking, but hopefully I can avoid that.  My last computer science work will be done later today. I have my Language Structures final from 1-3. It's hard to believe.

      Time is so short. I've been trying to take advantage of every waking moment, to the point on increasing my waking moments and minimizing my sleeping ones. Going on 3-5 hours of sleep a night starts to drag after a while.  My floor had a pick-a-date on Friday night. We went down to Indianapolis to get Cinnabuns and Orange Julius'. Well, my brother called about an hour before we left and invited me to go to King's Island the next day with him and a few of the music groups from his school. Seeing as I would already be down in Indy, it would work perfectly for me to just stay down there after the pick-a-date and go with Andrew the next day. The pick-a-date ended up being a lot of fun, and we even go somewhat locked in the mall - it took us a long time before we found an open exit leading to our parking garage. After a great time with friends, I sat in the car by myself driving to my brother's house.  I felt so alone.  I got to Andrew's house (he was out), and sat around in the silence of loneliness, realizing that my time with friends at Taylor is coming to a close. I got something of a taste of how apartment life after college will be. I started feeling really down, so I read my Bible for a bit and then just went to bed.  Saturday was a lot of fun. It rained all day at King's Island, but there was no lightning so the rides were still running. After a wet and cold day there, a long trip home on the bus, and a drive back up to Taylor from Andrew's house, I got back to my room around 3 AM.  After 5ish hours of sleep, I got up and went to church - for the last time where I've been going for the past 3.5 years. Now I'm sitting in my room, still realizing that my time here is short. I need to sleep, but I can't waste my time. I'm sad, excited, depressed, and exhausted all at the same time.  I think maybe I'll go for a walk to take my mind off of my world.

      I've been working a on project all day, but it's ok. As I was sitting down in the dungeon this afternoon, I realized that this is my last day of homework. So really, it doesn't matter that I've been working all day and I will continue to work tonight, because I am almost done.  It's interesting because that realization has given me almost a sense of motivation - so I don't mind the fact that there's still more to be done. Plus, this way I can say I did indeed work until the very end. And it is all for the glory of God.   Philippians 3:13b-14  "But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining for what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus."

      "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."  This is such an encouraging verse in times of uncertainty. And how much more uncertain can you be when you're leaving college, moving onto something totally new - while not knowing what that next something is. God commands us to not worry about tomorrow, and to incessantly seek him. May this verse provide encouragement to you today!

      Yesterday was Monday. It was a good day.  It was my last Monday in college. Well, at least for classes. I have a final next Monday, but that's not the same.  And the great thing is that I didn't even go to class today. We had a CSS luncheon today in honor of us graduating seniors, and so my first two classes were cancelled. I had a class at 2:00, but it was chemistry, so I decided not to go.  So yeah. No classes. A great phone conversation. No real homework.  A good day.

      I figured it out. I've been thinking this whole time that I don't have any connections to help me find a job, but I was wrong. Sure, I may not have too many connections at the moment, but I'm graduating with a great group of people - and they will become my connections.  Many of them have jobs lined up, and if I'm still looking for a job six months from now than chances are I can call one of them up and get some help. At that point they will be established enough to put my resume in the hands of their superiors and to say nice things about me. So yeah, it's not the end of the world after all!  And that's the end of the story.

      Some Caedmon's Call lyrics...  Well this day's been crazy But everything's happened on schedule From the rain and the cold To the drink that I spilled on my shirt 'Cause You knew how You'd save me Before I fell dead in the garden And You knew this day Long before You made me out of dirt  And You know the plans that You have for me And You can't plan the end and not plan the means And so I suppose I just need some peace Just to get me to sleep.

      After having posted about my gmail account, my hit count jumped up. So I checked it out, and apparently people were doing searches for gmail, trying to figure out how to get an account.  So let me make it clear right now: I cannot refer you. I stumbled on the offer due to my blog, and I have friends who did the same. Maybe the same will happen to you, maybe it won't.  But don't worry - it will eventually go live and you can then all be happy!

      It's funny how things work out sometimes.  I've been following Gmail for a while now, google's new email service. At the moment it's in beta mode, and is not publicly available. Well, I found out that another guy on the floor had managed to get an account somehow, so I asked him how it went. He told me that he had been referred by another friend who had gotten one through blogger.com, google-owned blogging service.  Well, if you are reading this than you know that I also have a blog through blogger.com. So I'm thinkin', hmm, I didn't get any offer like that. I told Telman that if he ever got a chance to refer someone, could he please refer me? He told me that he had already promised that to another friend if the chance presented itself. So I talked to Ben, the guy he had promised to refer, hoping to get somewhere in the string of referrals, with no idea if Gmail would even continue the referring process that long. Well, Ben already had someone else in line, so my hope was pretty much shot.  That was at lunch today. After lunch I came back to my room, went to the blogger homepage, and right there was an offer for me to sign up with Gmail. It said that because I was an active blogger I was being given this opportunity. I couldn't believe it. So I signed up, wondering if this was really happening. And now I have a Gmail account, so you can all write to me there!  The address is adam.griffis[at]gmail.com.

      I am part of the fellowship of the unashamed. I have Holy Spirit power. The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made, I am a disciple of His. I will not look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still.  My past is redeemed, my present makes sense, my future is secure. I am finished and done with low living, sight walking, small planning, smooth knees, colorless dreams, tamed visions, worldly talking, cheap giving, and dwarfed goals.  I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promotions, plaudits, or popularity. I do not have to be right, first, tops, recognized, praised, regarded, or rewarded. I now live by faith, lean on His presence, walk by patience, am uplifted by prayer, and labor by power.  My face is set, my gait is fast, my goal is heaven, my road is narrow, my way rough, my companions few, my guide reliable, my mission clear. I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured away, turned back, deluded, or delayed. I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of the adversary, ponder at the pool of popularity, or meander in the maze of mediocrity.  I will not give up, shut up, let up, until I have stayed up, stored up, prayed up, paid up, preached up for the cause of Christ. I am a disciple of Jesus. I must go till he comes, give till I drop, preach till all know, and work till He stops me. And when He comes for His own He will have no problems recognizing me…my colors will be clear.  ~ Author Unknown

      And I only have one week of classes left.  I calculated it out, and I have 9 hours 45 minutes left in class (minus exam week), and that's if I don't skip any more...  One of the guys I'm graduating with applied with Google, and he had his phone interview yesterday. At the end of the interview, the guy talking to him asked if he could make it up to Chicago for a face-to-face interview today at 3 PM. Chris said, "I think I can make that work," or something to that effect, and the guy said, "That's the right answer!" So hopefully that interview went well for him today. Google would be such a great place to work.  On another note, I FINALLY got an oil change today. It's been way too long timewise, even though I was still under 3000 miles. So now I feel much better about my car - and that's a good thing.

      Well, as most of you know, I own a beautiful Columbian Red-Tail Boa. It's only a few months old, and after a worrisome 6-7 weeks, it finally ate it's first mouse. Since then it's still been picky about eating, but it has eaten one other time. So I'm hoping that it will continue eating and will live to a nice old age.  The thing is, its life will not be with me. I've decided that it will be too much hassle to take it with me down to Indianapolis, out the Massachusetts, back out here, and down to Dallas (if that's where indeed I end up). It would be very stressful on the snake, which is especially bad due to its eating habits. So, I've decided to give it to Jonnie. He lives on my floor and had two of them, one of which regrettably died last Friday to what could have been pneumonia. So he's down to one, but at the end of the year he'll have two again.  So it will be goodbye. I guess if I every really want one once I'm settled somewhere, I'll get another.

      Well, today I had my last test in my college career. Sure, I still have finals, but that's not the same. I also had my last chemistry lab, which was extra credit anyways. So now I really am close to being done. I have a quiz on Friday, a project due the last day of classes (May 14), and finals. That's it. So now I'm getting nervous again because the reality of being done with school and being out in the _real_ world is starting to hit. I'm not worried about working full time - I've done that before - but I'm worried about where I'm going to end up and where I'll find a job.  Update on graduation: I have some awesome friends from Massachusetts who are driving all the way out here (it sucks it's only for that one day), my best friend is hoping/planning on being here, and my brother and his wife will be here. I'm excited because my friends from all over the place will get to meet eachother. Who would have thought that three different sections of my life - Cameroon, Massachusetts, and Taylor - would collide in such a wonderful way!  Tonight was a fun night. It started off with a tribunal up on broho, the floor above us. You wouldn't understand even if I tried to explain it, so I won't try. Then we had some fun here on Sammy II, with one guy trying to eat a gallon of cottage cheese in an hour. So yeah, he didn't make it. Good thing we put down plastic and had a trash can next to him! To end the festivities, we watched a video of the Sammy II Titans (intramural football team) win the championship in 2002. So yeah, a good time.

      I don't have caller ID, so I have no idea who calls me unless they leave a message. For instance tonight, someone called, but they didn't leave a message. My answering machine blinks AS IF I have a message, but it ends up just being a click as the unknown person hangs up.  So please, if you happen to call, at least let me know who it is so I can call you back!

      Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated  [Chorus] I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current and let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      As a Christian, my relationships with friends should stem from my relationship with Christ. I should be focused first on him, with him as my guide in all my other relationships. Then, because I am "right with God," I should be able to show Christ's love to others and be wise in my relations with friends.  Why is it that so often I turn that upside down?  Instead of focusing first on Christ, I focus on my other relationships. I keep God in the picture, but so often he's somewhere in the background. Then things get all messed up. I have a good time with friends, and things are going well - and I praise God because of it. But when things _aren't_ going so well, my relationship with Christ fades as well. It's as if my emotions at the time dictate my relationship with God - well, it was a bad day, so God obviously doesn't care about me.  How wrong is that??  Oh Lord, help me to put you foremost in my life!

      So I have this really cool group of friends out here that I hang out with all the time. We have Bible Study on Wednesday nights, and then we hang out during the weekend, and also sometimes weeknights. So it's fun.  Well, we decided on Wednesday night that Saturday we would go to the beach. The weather looked a bit intimidating Saturday morning, but it really cleared up that afternoon. A word to the wise (or should it be the "unwise" in this situation??) - put on sunblock! Yeah, me being me, I didn't. Laying out at the beach for three hours in the middle of the day without sunblock is not the smartest thing I could possibly have done...  But oh well, it doesn't really hurt. The only place that really is bothering me is behind my kneecaps. It even hurts to straighten my legs. Doh.  It's all good though - I'll be in pain for a few days, and then I'll go to the beach again!!!

      My parents arrived safe and sound (or is it safely and soundly...) in the States yesterday afternoon. My sister talked to my mom on the phone, and apparently the trip went well save for one lost piece of luggage. And even that should be here later today, so it's all good.  They, along with Aron and Amy, will be coming down to the chapel tomorrow. It's weird because I haven't seen them in a year, and yet it feels like so much less time than that. It's amazing what growing up can do to ya!  My dad has testing on Monday, and hopefully that will show what his next phase of treatment should / will be.  God is good. God is awesome.  And from Jess:  James 1:12 - Blessed is the man who perseveres...

      I'm excited because I was walking through Kohl's yesterday to buy a white dress shirt and a black tie, and I just happened to walk by the shoe section. I saw a pair I really liked, noticed they were on sale, and low and behold they had my size!  So I have new shoes now. My old ones lasted me just about a year, but the holes in the bottom didn't help keep the water out, so it was time to move on...  On a totally not-shoes-related subject, my parents should be in the States now! They should have flown in just after noon today, going up to Aron and Amy's place from the airport. On Sunday they will be heading down here, and that will be nice because I haven't seen them in a year.  Actually, come to think of it, my parents ARE related to my shoes - they bought my last pair the last time I saw them. It's been the same amount of time since I saw them that I got new shoes.  I knew my ramblings weren't  totally  random!!!

      ...all that much to talk about.  Same old, same old. I'm looking for a job, and my resume has been submitted.  I hung out with friends last night at Wednesday Night Bible Study. The best part in my opinion was when we were sitting around a fire singing. It's so easy for me to get caught up in life and to worry about things, and it was good to get my focus aimed back where it should be.  I need to keep coming back to what truly matters - God. Besides, this life is like the blink of an eye, so some of the small things just don't matter. Life is just life, and I'm taking it as it comes to me.  For those of you who are like me, and who tend to get down or worry about life, here are a few verses to encourage you:  Matthew 6:27 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?  Matthew 6:33-34 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.  And one of my favorites:  Psalm 37:4 Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart.

      The speaker at my graduation said that "life is what happens while you are making plans." And it's so true.  At the moment, there's been a rain delay, but the game's not cancelled. It's still too early to tell, but rain is never good, so I don't have much hope that the game will be played after all.  Besides, maybe the game was never supposed to happen anyhow.  Proverbs 4:23 Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.

      ...is finally starting to thin out.  Finish college classes and homework -  CHECK  Make it through finals week -  CHECK  College graduation ceremony -  CHECK  Have a blast with friends grad weekend -  CHECK  Hang with Andrew through my bday -  CHECK  June 4, drive out to MA -  CHECK  Get moved in with Dan and Abby -  CHECK  Find a job  As you can see, everything is done except that last thing. Yes, it's crucial, but at the same time it's all I really have left to get done at the moment. Once I have a job, I won't be broke all the time anymore. I can't freaking wait.

      And things are going fairly well.  My car broke down in the middle of PA on the drive out here. I stopped at a gas station, filled up, went inside and paid, and when I came back outside my engine coolant was all over the ground instead of in my radiator. Yay for old cars!  But God was looking out for me. At this point in the trip, exits were 10-15 miles apart, and I just happened to stop at the ONE gas station that had a truck garage in the back. I got my car over there, they checked it out, ordered a new radiator, and 4 hours later I was back on the road. I ended up getting to Dan and Abby's place at 11:30 at night, so even with the 4 hour delay it wasn't so bad. Good thing I started the trip at 4 in the morning...  So anyhow, I'm here, and I've already had some time to hang out with friends, and things are going fairly well. I've had some kind of crazy sinus headache or something for about a week now, but I picked up some drugs (advil wasn't touching it) and hopefully I'll be better in a few days. We'll see - it's been a real pain so far.  On another note, I've started talking to people here and hopefully the connections I have will lead to a job before toooo long. I was thinking about not starting a job until August, but now I'm thinking that once I find a job, I'll start whenever. Hopefully something will open up soon.  I'm out. It's been a while since my last post, but I still plan on keeping this updated.

      I'm 23 years old now. Wow. I'm gettin' up there. Soon I won't even remember WHEN my birthday is...  So here I am in a little coffee shop spending a bit of time on the internet. I'm living at Andrew's place in Indy right now, and he doesn't have an internet connection. I must say that it's quite the change going from a dedicated connection at Taylor to having nothing at all. I mean, I hadn't even checked my email in a few days...  But here I am now, and I'll be heading out to MA on Friday morning, bright and early. I'm hoping to leave between 3:00 and 3:30 in the morning. That way by the time breakfast comes around I'm already a good way into the trip.  Well, I need to go - I think someone else may need to use this computer now...  I'll update this again once I'm out in MA!!!!

      Work is going well so far. I don't have my office yet - it's full of file cabinets at the moment. And I don't have my computer yet - they just ordered it today. But it's ok. Right now I'm sharing an office with another guy who started two months ago, and they hooked me up with a nice and slow PIII laptop so I can still do stuff until my new machine (a desktop) comes in.    Apart from that, life is pretty much the same. I'm still amazed at how quickly things happened out here, both the bad AND the good.    Yadda, yadda, yadda - it's just linkin park lyrics. I like the song.    "My{Dsmbr" (feat. Mickey P., Kelli Ali)    This is my December  This is my time of the year  This is my December  This is all so clear    This is my December  This is my snow-covered home  This is my December  This is me alone    And I  Just wish that I didn’t feel  Like there was something I missed  And I  Take back all the things I said  To make you feel like that  And I  Just wish that I didn't feel  Like there was something I missed  And I  Take back all the things I said to you    And I’d give it all away  Just to have somewhere to go to  Give it all away  To have someone to come home to    This is my December  These are my snow-covered trees  This is me pretending  This is all I need

      The tunnel has been dark for me. My life has been totally up in the air.    Finally, there is some light. I GOT A JOB!!!!    This all transpired in just over a week. I got an email from a company called Anteon Corporation saying they wanted me to interview with them - and the interview happened two days later. That was on Thursday. On Friday I left for Mike and Teresa's wedding in Dallas, and we got back Sunday evening. On Tuesday Anteon  called saying they wanted a copy of my transcript from Taylor. On Wednesday they told me that everything was looking good and that I would hear back in the morning.    Well on Thursday morning I didn't hear anything before I left for Starbucks (my part-time job). When I got home there was a message on the machine from Anteon saying they were ready to extend me an offer. Well, a bit later I got in touch with them to get the details, and it all looks good to me.    The actual offer should arrive in the mail tomorrow. I need to look it over, sign it, and take it with me to Anteon on Monday morning. Yep, that soon. I'm sooo excited.    Thank you Lord! Now if you could just help me out in other areas as well.... :-)

      A month and a half ago when I came out to Massachusetts I had something to look forward to. Something to be excited about. Something to make me want to be here.    And then I went to Dallas for the wedding. It was a good weekend away.    But now I'm back again.    Only this time, I had absolutely nothing to look forward to.

      This weekend will be really good. Dan, Abby and I are flying down to Dallas for Mike Nobles' wedding. We'll meet up with lots of friends from Cameroon, and it will be a nice reunion.  And it will be good to get away. Good to have something of a break from this place.  And who knows - maybe I'll really like it down there and reconsider moving down to the Dallas area. The only way that will happen though is if I find a job down there first. I don't feel like moving into another uncontrollable situation. Besides, I really have it good up here in NE with free rent and family around.

      If the weather clears enough (somewhat doubtful), my sister, one other friend, and I are considering going to the Providence Water Fires. It should be a good time. It'll be a nice small group. I'm tired of big group activities, and it seems to be hard to do things in smaller groups around here.  If you invite a couple people to something and other people don't get invited, it becomes this big old issue of "why wasn't I invited???" Grow up a bit. It's ok to hang out with just a few people sometimes. We're not in high school anymore.  Anyhow, it's supposed to rain for the next four days or so. Maybe the weather decided to imitate my mood.

      I guess now I'm just something of a skeptic because it's the safest way to be. I'll keep living life, and I'll be fine in the end. I always am. But it's another layer to break through later. Another piece of protection from getting hurt yet again sometime down the road. Thing is, it's my own fault. I let myself get into a situation that was risky. We're friends, and maybe one day we'll be good friends again. Only time will tell.  Select lyrics from "Don't Stay" Linkin Park, Meteora  Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe Sometimes I need you to stay away from me Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need you to go  [Chorus:] Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just give me myself back and Don’t stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just give me myself back and Don’t stay  Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself Sometimes I’m in disbelief I didn’t know Somehow I need to be alone

      So sometimes I'm stupid and I do dumb things.  I've worked to get past that, and tonight I really tried to be _normal_ and to make an effort not to be stupid in how I acted.  But apparently it didn't work, and I got a dose of my own medicine.  Right now, I hate my life. Maybe tomorrow things will be better. But right now...  I just hate my life.

      I was ok last night. At least that's what I kept telling myself.  I woke up this morning feeling sick inside.  Scared that all the conversations, all the emails, all the hours on the phone  All the fun times shared together  Were for naught.  Hoping beyond hope that this is just another bumb in the road.  Oh Lord, what am I to do?

      I'm sitting at work, and at the moment I don't really have anything to do. My boss is on vacation and the work that he left for me to do is as done as I can get it at the moment.  And he's gone for two more weeks.  Oh well. Such is life. I know that once he's back and things pick up I'll be busy all the time, so I don't want to take "slow" time for granted.  New in my life? Yeah right, like anything actually happens in my life. Get up. Go to work. Come home. Maybe hang out. Go to bed.  At least it's a pretty set schedule. I like knowing my schedule.  Other than that - same old, same old. I still get confused.

      "For You To Notice..." - Dashboard Confessional  I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head where I would impress you with every single word I said. Would come out insightful or brave or smooth or charming and you'd want to call me And I would be there every time you'd need me I'd be there every time... But for now I'll look so longingly waiting... For you to want me, for you to need me, for you to notice me

      My sister and a couple of friends threw a surprise party for me last night, celebrating the fact that I found a job! I honestly had no idea that it was planned, so that was cool.  Between good friends, ice cream cake, and stoli all around - it was a fun night.  So thanks guys! You're all awesome.
