      So I am still having Spring Break. Nothing too exciting about that really. Carolynn’s school is having a book fair and tomorrow she is going. She had her eye on a couple of books I guess. Catherine is still being Catherine. She polished off a little machine with M&M’s in it early this morning. It’s not like we don’t feed the kid. She ate a nice bowl of Mud and Bugs for breakfast. (Mud and Bugs is Lion King cereal.) She had peanut butter and jelly for lunch and we went to the Taco Bell for dinner. So we aren’t starving her, yet she feels the need to get up before everyone else and eat as much junk as she can find as quickly as she can.   So Amy Adams got kicked off of American Idol today. I can’t believe that. Carolynn is just shocked. None of those girls deserved to go this week. I liked all of the girls in the bottom three; Amy Adams, Jennifer Hudson, and Latoya London. I thought John Stevens was worse than any of those girls. I thought Camile Velasco needed to go and she wasn’t even in the bottom three. I thought she was the worst one this whole time, as you may have known by reading this. But like Simon said, this is what happens when you let America vote. Of course, the votes are a bit off because of people like my sister. She has said she is voting for Jon Peter Lewis no matter if he is the best or the worst singer, but just because he is cute.  Teenage girls are so weird!!!  I thought that even when I was a teenage girl.   I have been reading this book for my history class. It is a collection of 100 stories from the Middle Ages. I have to write a 6 page paper by using these stories to show how life must have been like during this time. So far all I have learned is that there was a lot of sexual stuff going on and I have only read 9 of the stories. Well, that is all for now.   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Today I ran a few errands. I went to the bank, stopped by the NEX to pick up  Brother Bear  on DVD. I went over to the Barnes and Noble and got a few new books, thanks to my friend Trish. I went to the Best Buy and got some printer ink and the movie  How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days . I stopped and got milk on the way home. We had frozen pizza for dinner. It is Motown night on American Idol. I voted Fantasia Barrino, Carolynn voted for Jennifer Hudson, and I predicted that Phillip would have voted for Diana Degarmo. He was at work, as usual. He will watch it in the morning when he gets home. I think Camile Velasco is going to get voted off. Of course, I thought that she’d go the last three weeks and it hasn’t happened yet. So we’ll see.   -/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/  Take My Advice   Men: Save your breath for your inflatable dolls.

      I didn’t have to go to school today! Cari and Glenn left this morning. I took a nap. I raked some of the garden. The crocuses have bloomed. I have been doing some studying. Carolynn said she had a bad day at school. Catherine refuses to learn to ride her bike. She can ride just fine, but as soon as she realizes you’ve let go, she just falls off. So there isn’t really anything exciting today.  *^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*  Wise Words   Kids in the front seat cause accidents. Accidents in the back seat cause kids.

      Being that is Sunday, I am not doing anything today. I am making spaghetti for dinner. Friends are still visiting. I stayed up late playing Pong and Pac-Man. It was like 1982. That’s about it for now.   Just Something To Think About   Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.

      So, it is a bit cooler today than it has been all week. Only into the 40’s today so far and not expected to past 52. Still better than snow. Well, now that school is out for Spring Break, all I have been doing is studying. I have written an essay for my politics class. I have taken notes for another one. I still have so much more I want to do before school starts back up again. My friend Cari is visiting today. Phillip and her husband Glenn have been talking cars and running to the Krispy Kreame. Carolynn and Paige are bringing down the house. Scott is doing what Scott does which is playing video games. Not much else going on. It’s Saturday so there isn’t even anything on TV.   +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+  Mythology For You   What is the name of the legendary bird that sets fire to it self and then rises from the ashes to live again?

      So it’s Friday. Last nights Friends was a good one. I had my last history class before Spring break today. My teacher has assigned a book report for over the break. That kind of sucks. The weather is getting better. It has been raining for days, but in the 60’s. I have been getting the house cleaned. I got the floors all mopped. I painted my toenails blue since it is going to be sandals season soon. What an exciting life I lead!  In other news, I saw that Richard Simmons was charged with assault after he slapped a guy in an airport for making fun of his Sweatin’ To The Oldies videos. I saw that there was a four eared cat in Germany who finally found a family to adopt it. That was kind of creepy and weird.   I am sure you have heard that there is currently a case in the Supreme Court that will decide whether the words “under God” belong in the Pledge Of Allegiance. As the case goes, a man took a school district in California to court because he didn’t think his child saying those words was constitutional. He is an atheist and feels that every time his daughter said the pledge it was like a slap in the face to him. What I find odd about the whole situation is that he does not have custody of the child, the mother does. And what is even odder is that the mother is raising the daughter as a Christian, as she is one herself. Also, as it turns out, the daughter doesn’t really care either way. The way I see it, when you say the pledge, you are pledging to the country and the words “Under God” do not necessarily mean anything religious, but something said out of respect for the men who founded this country, who were Christian. It is traditional, like the words “In God We Trust” printed on our money or the prayers that are offered before sessions of Congress or the Supreme Court. However, the reason that they put those words in, in 1954, was to show how we were better than those godless communists. So that in it self may be unconstitutional. I don’t know. It all seems kind of like a waste of the courts time to me. There is no law saying that the little girl has to say the pledge at all. So why bother taking all this time and money to decide it. People really have gone kind of sue-happy. I saw on the news that most Americans think the pledge should stay how it is. (Also for those who can't remember the words: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States Of America, and to the rupublic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.)  So that is all the news for today. Tomorrow is my last class before Spring Break. I am just one biology class away from freedom for a whole week. And my friend Cari is coming over tomorrow. Sounds like it’s going to be a good weekend. And the best part, today I saw my tulips and things shooting up.

      Last nights Survivor was just a recap episode. That must mean there’s a merge coming, even though they hinted that there was going to be some major twist instead. I still think Boston Rob is an a—hole. I think women are going to be his downfall. He thinks he is just such a stud muffin. The only person I know who is any kind of baked good is my own Sweetie Pie. I also think Jerri has to go. I hate her.   Then on American Idol, I thought it would be Camile Velasco to be the one to go. I have never really liked her. I liked Matt Rodgers. He wasn’t the greatest on Tuesday, but I thought Camile was worse. We saw my mom and dad and my sister in the audience. They were sitting behind the judges so they were on TV a bunch of times. Carolynn was so excited. It was so funny to see them on her favorite show. She is just having an exciting week; Clay and Kelly in concert and then Grandma and Grandpa on American Idol. Also, Kimberly Locke sang her song. Her album comes out May 4. We heard Clay sing one of the songs off her album on Monday night. They sing it together on her new album.   Today, I went to my politics class. Last one, because next week is Spring break. WOO HOO!!! NO SCHOOL FOR A WHOLE WEEK!!!! And we got out early, and didn’t have to do any work. That’s always a plus. Tonight is also the number 3 pick of best Friends episodes. I haven’t seen my favorite yet. But they are all good so I guess it doesn’t matter. Also, today is Phillip’s Aunt Sherri’s birthday, so happy birthday to her. Tomorrow is Friday. My friend Cari is coming to visit this weekend. Carolynn is excited to see her friend Paige. That is all for today.  ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()  Here’s A Puzzler:   Why do psychics have to ask for your name?

      Well, today not much happened. I went to my history class. I made pork chops for dinner. I was going to make them on Sunday, but Phillip had duty so I didn’t. Carolynn went to school. Phillip went to school. I got a certificate in the mail from my school saying that I made the college honor list. Tonight is both Survivor and American Idol. My mom, dad, and sister are seeing American Idol in person today, so we will be looking for them on TV tonight.  Phillip wants me to add that his mom is coming to visit. She is flying out here on June 9th and staying until the 15th. We are going to take the tour of Chicago, go to the Jelly Belly factory, and maybe we’ll go take the brewery tour. I am sure we will do some barbecuing and hanging out. Phillip is pretty happy about it.   <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  Historians Beware!!!

      I went to see Clay and Kelly Clarkson last night. Clay was the best. Every one was throwing underwear at him. One time someone threw Stitch [from the movie Lilo and Stitch]and he said it looked like the guy who played the guitar. Clay didn’t come out on the stage; he came on the other side of the stadium. He just popped out of the doors to the stadium like magic. When Clay was singing, everyone was standing, and then I had to stand on my chair. Everyone was screaming and yelling too. After Clay was done singing some people left. When Kelly came out no one screamed or yelled. When she was done singing, everyone clapped just normal. I got a book of Clay picture’s of him.  It cost $15. There were Kelly ones too, but I didn’t get the Kelly one. I got Clay because Clay is my boyfriend. I was so tired today I couldn‘t go to school. When we got home from the concert, I was sleeping and I unbuckled myself and walked in the house up the stairs in my room and in my bed.

      Last nights concert was pretty good. I liked Clay a lot better. They had a cute little opening act; The Beu Sister’s. Then they had Clay. He sang for about an hour and 15 minutes without leaving the stage. It was really good. Then there was about a 30 minute intermission while they changed the stage for Kelly. She came out and she sang for about 30 minutes with a costume change in there. Then they sang together and that was it. Carolynn got a Clay program. They had separate programs and they were $15 each. That was kind of a rip off. Anyway, Carolynn is writing her own article about her adventure.   Tonight is American Idol. Carolynn is still in love with Jon Peter Lewis. I had a politics test today. I didn’t study much because we were in Chicago, but I feel okay about it. I guess I am pretty old now. I don't think my skin knows though. I have to have Clearasil  and  Oil of Olay. I made my self a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  (That explains the Clearasil.)  Phillip made me steak for dinner. It was good. That's all for today.  #################################################  The Top Two Rules For Success    1. Never tell all you know.

      So today is the big day. Tonight at 7pm we will be watching Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken. Carolynn was so excited she could hardly go to school this morning. I don’t expect that she will make it to school tomorrow. It will be late by the time we get back from Chicago. The concert will be at the United Center, that is where the Chicago Bulls basketball team plays and also the Chicago Blackhawk’s hockey team. It is about an hour and a half from our house. We have both Kelly and Clay’s CDs in the truck ready to go. I also have all the country music CDs my sister sent me in my truck so we can hear them on our vacation.  Also, not nearly as important as American Idol, today I went to my history class. We watched a video. Catherine finally got to play on the playground at her school. She was so happy. Well, that is all for now.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Here’s A Question:   If “pro” is the opposite of “con”, is “progress” the opposite of “congress”?

      So it is Sunday. Sure there is no school, but that doesn't mean I get to relax or anything. I have to study. I have to clean the house. I have to do the laundry. Phillip has duty today. And it is cold on top of that. It hasn't even seen 30 degrees today. Yesterday it almost got to 60 but not today. I wish the weather would make up its mind.   Last night we watched  Mona Lisa Smile . It was pretty good. There is not much else happening today. I am making pork chops for dinner. There is a new  Simpson's  tonight. I love  The Simpson's . I made a few more new changes to our newspaper here. I have added a link for Carolynn's school and have fixed it so Phillip or Carolynn can write their own news. I doubt Phillip will. He isn't much for writing. But Carolynn might. Look for something by her on Tuesday about her trip to see Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken in concert. And for those who were dying to know; the winner of the Best Cartoon Character was  Patrick  from  Spongebob Squarepants . That's it for now.  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Ponder This.................   In Chinese philosophy, what are the two principles that represent earth and female, heaven and male?

      It looks like it hasn’t been a good week for skinny, blonde, rich chicks. I saw on the news that both Britney Spears and Paris Hilton were injured this week. Britney injured her knee during dance routine in a concert she was giving. Paris was injured when she fell off of a horse in Florida during a taping of her show “The Simple Life 2”. Just one reason I am glad I am neither skinny nor blonde. I wouldn’t turn down the being rich part though.  Carolynn and I are so jealous!! My mom and my sister are going to see a taping of American Idol on Wednesday. My sister has been on the waiting list for a long time and now she gets to go. Carolynn can’t wait to move back so she can go, but if you have to wait that long for tickets maybe I should sign up now. We have however seen the American Idol concert tour from season two and we are still seeing Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken I just two more days, but it would be so cool to see the actual show.  Not much else happened today. I went to biology and I had to touch mice and snakes to study their breathing. Mice are okay but I don’t care for snakes, and not that I want mice at my house or anything either. We finally got a new teacher that is staying. She is nice. Carolynn built a Barbie mall in her room complete with a Bath and Body Works. I thought that was kind of funny. I bought some Krispy Kreames on the way home from school so everyone, especially Phillip, is happy about that. There is nothing else to report today. It almost got up to 60 degrees out though. Tomorrow it is looking cold and rainy.     Remember……………..   If everything is coming your way, you’re probably in the wrong lane!

      Well, today is Friday.  WOO HOO!!!  Not that the weekend is going to be all spectacular. I still have biology tomorrow. Phillip has duty this weekend. And it will probably be cold. The forecast says it is going to be cold and rainy. That is better than cold and snowy. So maybe it is more of a  woo hoo!  than a   WOO HOO!!!     So there isn’t much else going on today. Carolynn was having a root beer float party in her reading group today to celebrate finishing the second grade text book. Catherine is going around begging for fruit. How come when we have fruit, no one eats it, it goes bad and ends up trash? But when we don’t have any, she is begging for it. What is really unusual about the whole situation is that she usually hates fruit and only wants to eat junk food.   Also, the other day, there was some wrong information on here. Phillip’s brother Alex is not 16, he is 17. And when you are that young you don’t want to be younger. Still, that is a pretty cool job for a 17 year old. When I was 17, I worked bussing tables at a restaurant full of cranky people. When Phillip was 17 he went to boot camp.

      There was controversy in our house last night. Do we watch Survivor and tape American Idol, or watch American Idol and tape Survivor? We ended up watching Survivor first. Can you believe this Survivor love story? They really need to break up the love birds. I already didn’t like Boston Rob to begin with. Can you believe that they voted off Ethan? Why would they keep Jerry over him? I can see that Ethan was stronger, but Jerri, as Carolynn says, is cranky.   After that we watched American Idol. Carolynn just loves when they all sing together and do that funny stuff. I think she is still laughing about Jon Peter Lewis in a banana suit and then he fell out of the hammock. And she got to see her boyfriend Clay Aiken. She gets to see him live again on Monday night. We saw him last summer on the American Idols concert tour. And of course, last night we had to say good-bye to Leah LaBelle. I guessed the bottom three would be Leah LaBelle, Camille Velasco, and John Stevens. Oh well, one of the ones I guessed was the one that got voted off.   Just So You Know-   There are three types of people in the world; those who can count and those who can’t.

      Are we feeling a wee bit Irish today? Is anyone drinking any green beer today? I don't think I will. I don't like beer when it's regular color. I guess that is a shame that we live 30 minutes from Milwaukee, also known as "Brew City". The Miller Brewery is right up there and they even give out free beer! In Chicago they color the river a bright green for St. Patrick's Day. Maybe there are a lot of Irish in Chicago.  Carolynn has some weird thing about eating at the  Kentucky Fried Chicken . At least once a week she asks to go there and every two weeks when I make a dinner list for the coming two weeks she tries to put going to  KFC  on it. So I took her there today. She was never so excited to eat. Her favorite cartoon character vote is going pretty good. So far Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is in the lead.  Don't forget to vote!   Well, the weather here is not good. I snowed today. It wasn't a lot of snow, but it was still snow. It is 32 degrees out. I have a friend who lives in Vermont, its a little colder there. Both of us wish we lived some place warmer.   Here's a question...........   Who  IS  this Oscar Meyer, and why does everyone want to be his wiener?

      So, I have found out that some people, people who were believed to be part of our circle of family and friends, do not consider themselves as such, so for them, they will no longer be considered as. If those individuals would like to continue to read this, well, it is a public website and I wouldn't dream of stopping them. Nor am I going to stop writing here. I am not changing myself for anyone. As for them, since we live so far away, and we never see or hear from most of these people anyway, I don't think it will make much difference as a whole.   And on we move:  American Idol was good tonight. Carolynn loved Jon Peter Lewis. I liked Fantasia Barrino. I predict that after Phillip watches it tomorrow, he will like either Matthew Rodgers or Diana Degarmo. But I could be wrong. Here's some good news; Phillip's younger brother Alex, who is 16, got himself a cool job working for a construction company. How cool! I wish I had such a cool job when I was 16. When I was 16 I had the biggest dork job- I worked at  Wienerschnitzel  selling hot dogs for less than $5 an hour. My mom got me the job while she was out watering the roses. Yeah, kind of a dorky story, but it is really true. Phillip got his first job at the  Del Taco . He told me he was going to get a job there so he could eat there all the time before he was even old enough to work and I think that may have been why they hired him. They may have thought he would spend all his pay on food. He may have too, if not for me and Carolynn. Now, that is still his favorite place for food and he misses it. They don't have  Del Taco  here, just  Taco Bell , and that is not the same. Other places that they don't have here-  Jack In The Box ,  In N Out , and  Carl’s Jr .  So, being that my birthday is coming up (exactly one week from today I'll be 25 for the third time), I got some new DVD's. I got  Schindler's List ,  American Wedding , and  Mona Lisa Smile . Also Carolynn spent her allowance on the movie  Uptown Girls . The only one we have watched so far is  Uptown Girls  and it was cute. We rented  Intolerable Cruelty  (George Clooney, Catherine Zeta Jones). It was pretty funny.  Mona Lisa Smile  looks really good. I will let you know after I watch it.  Well, Carolynn drew up a countdown to the Kelly Clarkson/Clay Aiken concert poster to countdown the remaining days until she goes. Only 6 days to go! She already has her clothes picked out. She is so funny.  Well, that is all the news I can think of.  Remember..............   The early bird my get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.

      I went and filed the papers to fight the unjust ticket I got at school yesterday. I got my midterm grade in my politics class today, and I am getting an A. You knew I would. In my opinion, politics is the easiest class I am taking this semester. (English, Biology, Western Civilization being the others) Well, Carolynn wanted me to tell you that she got an A+ on her music test. Catherine is grounded for trying to climb the gate to get into the snacks again. You would have thought she would have learned her lesson after last weeks peanut butter cup incident. Well, today is the last day for cartoon nominations.  Don't forget!!    Words To Remember-   A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.

      Well, today started out bad. I went to school. That was fine. I like my history class. Then after class, I went to pick up Catherine and when I came back out, some campus security guy had left me a ticket for  parking in the day care zone!  Now I have to go to the security office to fight it. The day care zone is for day care pick up which is what I was doing. The ticket is for $10, but it is the principle of the thing.  So then I went to the post office. There was a pretty long line, and I was waiting awhile. There was what I assumed were a lady and her teenage son standing in front of me. Well, that is what I thought until they started groping each other and making out in the post office!!!! I was so grossed out! All that trouble just to get stamps to send the bills. So when I got home we went to the IHOP for lunch. I swear that Phillip would eat there every day.  Keep working on those cartoon nominations.   *********************************  Do You Know??????

      Well, today just sucked. I have the flu. I had a midterm in English today. I really blew it. I didn't feel like taking a test. Phillip wasn't feeling so good today either. It is so windy today; I fear we may be blown to Oz. And it so cold out too.   In other family news, we had some sad news last night. Phillip's Aunt Chris had a stroke on Friday. It looks like she is going to be okay, but we are pretty sad that we live so far away and can't go see her. Just another reason we hate it here. Our family has to live so far away.  So that is it for today.  Don't forget your nominations for Best Cartoon Character, we have only gotten one response so far and Carolynn only has until Tuesday night.  -----------------------------------  A Little Advice-   Don't assume malice for what stupidity can explain.

      Today my biology professor quit. No reason was given, he just quit. Then they had to scramble around to find a substitute. Now we might have to have a different teacher every week from now on. That could make things much harder. I was used to the teacher I had; now I have no idea what to expect.   Well, today we went bowling. Just so you know I won two out of three games, however the third game was played with bumpers. It was Carolynn's idea to go bowling. She went on an honor roll field trip bowling a few weeks ago and has been begging to go ever since.

Other members of her class are doing things like Best Candy Bar, Best TV Show, Best Movie, Best Dessert, and others. She can't remember all of them. I have biology in the morning. Phillip is on Spring break next week. Well, that is it for today.   Don't forget to nominate your favorite cartoon character!

      So Carolynn brought home this assignment today-   Dear Parents: Because this is an election year, we have been talking about voting in our second grade class. We have taken votes on many topics over the past week. Now we would like to test out topics and see if they are the same in our classroom as out. So for the next week’s homework we will be conducting individual votes. Each child has been assigned a topic. We would like for you to take nominees for that topic from now until Tuesday. Ask your family and friends, ect. Send the results of your nomination process with your child on Wednesday. On Wednesday, take your top three nominees and have your child write a short paragraph on why each should win. Then conduct a vote. Send the paragraphs and the final results with your child on Friday. If for any reason you can not participate, please contact me Monday. Mrs. Falcon   So there you have it. Carolynn's topic is  Best Cartoon Character . Please email your nominees and those for your household to me at  navywifejd@hotmail.com . Please be specific and include the cartoon where it appears.   For Example-   Don't just say The Flintstone's, say Wilma Flintstone from The Flintstones    Okay everyone, get to work!

       Trivia For Today-   What is the name of the international organization of insurance underwriters that is headquartered in London?   ------------------------------- So I lied. Catherine is still sick. I don't think Carolynn is feeling that great either. She didn't want to eat dinner last night and she loves pork chops! Also she fell asleep during American Idol last night. So not much else happening here. It is cold and really windy here. It is supposed to snow tonight. It is currently 25 degrees out. It is Survivor night. I hope that Boston Rob gets the boot. I am sick of him. He thinks he is hot stuff. Also tonight, the number 5 top episode of Friends. That's all. -------------------------------   Answer To Trivia Question-   Lloyd's Of London

      So last nights American Idol...... Carolynn voted for Jennifer Hudson, I voted for Leah Labelle, and Phillip for Suzy Vulaca. It was the opinion of people who were calling into a radio station poll this morning that Jon Peter Lewis was going to make it. My sister thinks he is cute. We'll see tonight.  Well, my family didn't stay far enough away from me and now I am sick. I hate being sick. The good news is everyone else seems to have gotten better.   Well, nothing exciting happening today, just the same old stuff.    Advice For The Day--   Never take investment advice from someone who is still working.

      So now Phillip  and  Catherine are sick. They need to just stay away from me. Today, I had my politics class. Then I had some errands to run. I went to the bank, I went to the gas station, I went to the Taco Bell, and I went to the post office to mail a package to my friend Trish's daughter Sidney. It was her birthday a few weeks back and it has been sitting on my desk since then.  (This goes to show how much I like to go to the post office.)  I also sent some CD's to my sister. Then I went to the video store. See what kind of fancy life I lead! Well, it is American Idol night. Phillip is pretty disappointed that he has to miss it.  So last night I was trying to do my homework and the ghost in our bathroom was driving me nuts. (In case you didn't know, our house is haunted. The ghost mostly stays in the downstairs bathroom. We are pretty sure it is a female ghost. We've seen her a couple of times in the mirror in there and sometimes she makes it smell like some kind of old lady perfume, it smells kind of like baby powder, and she knocks the shower curtain down every so often.) Anyway, I was trying to do homework last night and the perfume smell was so strong it was giving me a headache. If you don’t want to believe it, fine, but you don't have to live here.  That's all for today folks!!!   -----         Did you know that Chicago is an Indian word that means the smell of an onion plant?

      Well, it's Monday. Not much exciting about Monday. Carolynn is still sick. I am doing homework. Phillip seems to be reading a Highlights For Children magazine. I got a really nice vacation guide from Tennessee. Big plans for tonight include a frozen lasagne and watching TV.  Exciting!

       No  school,  NO  work, just sleeping in! We went to the IHOP for some breakfast, but Carolynn didn't go because she was sick. She seems to have woke up with the stomach flu. She has been in her room all day drinking 7-Up and watching musicals. So far she has watched Guys and Dolls and Damn Yankees. I think she just watches that one for an excuse to say damn. Have a nice peaceful, relaxing day!!

      So today I had a biology class all morning, from 8 to 1. That means I have to leave here at 7 am to get there on time. It really sucks. I am still getting an A, but I still would rather sleep in.  I finished my plans for our "Redneck Vacation". We are going to see a lot of cool stuff in Nashville.  We are going to see country music stuff as well as historic stuff. We are even seeing the Jack Daniels Factory. Well, Carolynn's rash issues are clearing up. Catherine is still insane. Phillip is still Phillip.   For those of you who were concerned , Elvis is fine.  (In case you didn't know, I had been concerned that there was something wrong with him. He had been getting really thin, and he is usually really mellow and one day he actually attacked Catherine and me when we come home from picking up some take out Chinese food. He always begs, but he actually bit us and tried to knock us down and wouldn't stop.)  Anyways, we have been feeding him more food and added a little canned food to his usual dry food. He is fattening up nicely and hasn't tried to attack anyone since. The vet said he just needed more food because it was winter time and he needed more fat on him.   Well, everything else is fine. Hope everyone else is fine.

      Well, I am glad Sue is gone off of Survivor. Just get rid of Boston Rob and I will be happy. So nothing amazing happened today. I went to school. We have just begun a section on anchientt Rome. It is very interesting. Phillip took a midterm in his calculus class today. We went out for dinner to our favorite Mexican resturant. Well, that is all for today. Tomorrow, I have a biology class. That is it.

      Well, I know you have all been on pins and needles- but I got an A on my politics test on Tuesday.  Woo Hoo!!  Anyway, today has been pretty normal. Went to school, took Catherine out for a Happy Meal, and worked on my vacation plans. It is looking like we are going to see a lot of cool stuff on our vacation to Tennessee. Not just country music sights, but historical sites too. Maybe even Elvis' house.  (not the dog, but the King Of Rock and Roll.)  Well, it is Survivor night. I am glad the naked guy is gone. Now we just need to get rid of Susan and Boston Rob. I hate them. I can't believe that Friends is almost over. I just love that show. Well, it is raining here. I forgot the dogs were outside and they got drenched. Phillip took his test this morning, and then he went over to his friend’s house to help him with his car issues. Dave’s car always has issues. So I won’t see Phillip until tomorrow. Well, that is all the news of today.

      So I had to take Carolynn to the doctor today. She had a weird scabby rash spot over her eye.  (You know you wanted to hear about that)  The doctor thinks it probably winter eczema so they gave her a bunch an ointments and lotions to help clear it up. She says it smells bad. I think it smells like diaper rash medicine. The worst part about the day was I had to miss my history class to take her to the doctor and I also really hate going to the Navy hospital. There are too many teenagers there who think they know what they are doing, but they don't.   So last nights American Idol, Carolynn and Phillip voted for John Stevens, the red haired Frank Sinatra impersonator. I voted for Tiara Purifoy, the last girl who sang last night. I actually had to vote for Phillip because he was working, but after he watched the show from last night, I was right about who he would have voted for.  Go John and Tiara!!!     In Other News-   Phillip is taking a test tomorrow to get promoted from E-5 to E-6. Everyone keep your fingers crossed  (and keeping your toes, arms, legs, and eyes crossed couldn't hurt) . If he makes it, this means more money and a tiny bit better choice of duty. We don't get to find out the results until June so I'll keep you posted.   Well, that is it for now. See you later!

      Okay, so today it is a little colder than it was yesterday. And yet, I actually saw people at school wearing capri pants and tank tops like it was June or something.  What a bunch of weirdos!  Not much else to say today. Catherine is eating everything in her path today. Some days I can't get her to eat anything. Carolynn is looking forward to her American Idol vote tonight. She is upset because Phillip had his hours changed and doesn't get to vote with us. Well, only 20 more days until the first day of Spring. In case you couldn't tell, I am really hoping that it will warm up soon. That's it.

      So today has been okay. It has gotten up to  55 degrees  outside today. If it wasn't raining, I'd practically need sun tan lotion!!! I had a history test today. Catherine has been watching cartoons, Carolynn has been at school. Phillip had a calculus class and he has to go to work later. I have a politics test tomorrow. Our bigs plans for tonight- eating taquitos and watching American Idol. See aren't you glad you know this stuff? Aren't you glad you are missing this? We are such a lively bunch!   Well, we do have lives, it is just too cold to live them. My mom and I are planning a "Hee-Haw-Redneck-Hoedown Vacation" to Tennessee. We are going in May to Nashville. We are going to the Grand Ole Opry and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  YEE HAA!!!!!  Carolynn and I are going to see Clay Aiken and Kelly Clarkson in concert on March 22. If it ever warms up we might do other stuff.   For all you car buffs , Phillip has this car............. It's a 2004 Chevy Cavalier. It is black. He keeps doing stuff to it, and he thinks I should inform you all about it, if anyone cares besides him, which I doubt. First, he painted the enigine blue.  (Like anyone can see that) . Then he got these pedals that glowed blue, then he got something that made the speedometer and stuff blue too. He got some accesories like a steering wheel cover and some other stuff that I am not sure about. Then he got new rims, and finally, this past weekend he added a dual exhaust  (because one is obviously not enough) . As soon as I get some, I am sure he will have me post detailed pictures. And all this time I thought cars were for transportation. If anyone cares,  (which I doubt)  I own a 2000 GMC Jimmy. It is red and dirty.  And that is the way I like it!   Well, that is all for today.

      Well, today is Monday, March 1, 2004. It is 42 degrees here is Kenosha, Wisconsin where we are currently being held hostage by the Navy. We are counting down the days until we can escape. As of right now, for those of you who are dying to know, we don't know where we are going from here or when that might be. Phillip has to finish his time here first, and then he will have to go to school to learn something. What he did before no longer exists, so he has to learn something new. He will still be an electronics technician, but he is in need of a new specialty. If he decides to be a submarine guy, then we will be heading for Groton, Connecticut for a year or so before moving on. Then we will be going to a naval base that supports submarines. Yes, they do have submarines in San Diego. :) However, they also have submarines in Hawaii, Washington, and Virginia to name a few. However, if they try to stick us some place cold (after Connecticut) I may go insane. Submarine school is not a sure thing yet though. He would have a longer time at school if he choses submarines and I am a little leery of him being in something that is meant to sink, though he does like the equipment and the extra pay that comes with the submarine job. He also would like to work on some other types of smaller ships and the schools for that are much shorter, like 6-8 weeks instead of a year or so. If he decides to go the small ship route, more than likely, San Diego here we come!!!! And that is all I have to say about that!

      So today I went to my history class. Then I went to the commissary. I got lots of groceries. I got Carolynn the Chunky Monkey she asked for. My mom calls Catherine a chunky monkey. Then we went to the Taco Bell. I went to the post office to get stamps. The post office is the coolest building in Kenosha. It is historical. Phillip and I took a drive out to the 7-11 to get some sodas, lottery tickets, ( I didn't win. ) and some Garbage Pail Kids for my collection.  I lead the most exciting life. Tomorrow is Carolynn’s friends sleep over. She wrapped the present her self. It doesn’t look half bad. We got the suitcases aired out and sprayed them with Fabreeze to get them ready for vacation. The girls packed their bathing suits and Carolynn packed her cowgirl boots. There is only one more week of school, plus finals.  Only 3 weeks from today until we leave on our Hee Haw Vacation.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  Language Barriers   What do the Japanese call Japan?   Answer   Nippon

      Another beautiful day in Kenosha; temperatures in the high 70’s, a little windy and kind of cloudy, but great. We are expecting a storm tonight. I planted some tomatoes and bell peppers today. I got some petunias but I couldn’t plant them in the pot I wanted to because I didn’t have enough dirt. Carolynn has been invited to her friend Svacia’s birthday sleep over on Saturday night. We went to the Wal-Mart to pick out a present for her. Carolynn got the American Idol Season 3 CD while we were there and I got Catherine some floaties for her vacation. That way she can go in the pool at the hotel in Nashville.  Anyway, on to TV. ( What am I going to write about in the summer? ) First, on  Survivor , Shii Ann got kicked off the island. Who didn’t see that coming? Now it will get interesting. Big Tom is such a redneck hick. Rupert is getting a little weird. Nobody likes Jenna. And Boston Rob and Amber are too powerful.  The game is on!    Then on the second to the last  Friends  ever, I cried. I cry about everything on TV and in movies though. I have seen  Homeward Bound  at least a million times and I always cry when the dogs make it home. I always cry at the end of  Titanic  when the old lady drops the necklace into the ocean. I cried at the end of  Freaky Friday  when the mom and the daughter switch back. I still want Ross and Rachel to get back together before the end. I think they will. I will miss that show.   *****************************************************  Presidential Trivia   How many Electoral College votes does your state get?

      Today was the most beautiful day I have seen in awhile. It was windy, but it was 79 degrees and sunny. I went to my history class. I was informed that I will have to show up at 8 am for my final on the 12th. Just what I wanted to do, get up that early for a big test. I got back the paper I wrote about the book,  The Decameron . You’ll be glad to know that my record is in tact. I have never gotten less than an A on a paper I have written. There weren’t even any comments or anything written on it. It just said  "not bad"  next to the A on the last page. I really enjoy writing, in case you haven’t noticed. So I have decided to take a Creative Writing in the fall. I need the elective credits anyway. Since it was such a nice day, I took the girls out for a Happy Meal and to the zoo. I have been doing the laundry. I have been working on the yard. I planted a nice rose bush out front. I planted plenty of pretty flowers in the pots on the porch. That way we’ll have a nice yard when Phillip’s mom comes, and I’ll get some pictures for when we sell the house because it will probably be winter and it won’t look as nice covered in snow.   So we are down to five on  American Idol . It was about time they got the bottom three right. ( Yes I am still mad about last week .)   Finally   we got rid of John Stevens. I was so glad about that. You should have heard the cheering in this house. You would have thought he won, not got voted off. Speaking of voted off, tomorrow is  Survivor . Only a few more of those to go. I think Rupert should win. Of all the players left I hate him the least. I think Shii Ann should go further too. I don’t really care for her, but she takes a lot of crap and she was a marked woman and she pulled though and that was cool. There was this really cool  Biography  on  A&E  tonight all about  Friends . Only two more of those to go. I can’t imagine life without that show. I will have to buy them on DVD like I do with  The Simpson’s .  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Zoo Question   How many bones are there in a giraffe’s neck?

      Well, today was just about as exciting as yesterday. I went to the library to get some books on Marilyn Monroe. The girls got some books. Carolynn checked out the movie  Sister Act  for the millionth time. Phillip checked out the movie  Hot Shots . Catherine has an appointment to get tested for Kindergarten on May 20th. If Phillip can get his orders before that, she doesn’t have to get tested; she’ll just be let in. He is supposed to get his orders in May or so, so hopefully he gets them before the 20th. And with that we will all know when and to where we will be moving.  WOO HOO!   Well, tonight on American Idol, the six that were left had to sing some Latin music. I like Gloria Estefan music, but I don’t think the men left on were very good. I think that the only guy to sing Latin music is Ricky Martin. Most of the girls were pretty good. We put in three votes for Diana Degarmo this week. I really hope that I never have to hear John Stevens on this show again. He is just so bad. I am still not over the Jennifer Hudson shocker of last week. John Stevens should have been gone last week. Only a few more weeks of Idol left. There are only three more Survivor episodes left and only two more Friends episodes to go. What will become of my TV viewing life?  ===================================  French Anyone?

      Well, not to much excitement going on here. Carolynn gave out some thank you cards for her friends at school. I worked on my English term paper. I worked on some other homework. Catherine sneaked a big chocolate bunny this morning and she polished off the rest of the birthday cupcakes. So she is in big trouble. Tomorrow will be American Idol. I hope that we won’t have to have a repeat of last week. I made pork chops for dinner. There are only a few more weeks of school for me, and then it is over. This classes six days a week is a pain. They are at all different times, and the school is an hour away and that makes it more difficult. In the summer I will only have classes twice a week and the same in the fall. It would be different if I didn’t have to take Catherine with me everyday. She makes getting going way harder. She drags her feet and plays around while we are trying to get ready. Well, not much else.  _______________________________________________________________  What Time Is It At Your House?

      So three girls came over for Carolynn’s party. They ate pizza and cupcakes and drank soda. They played games and stayed up late watching  Cheaper By The Dozen . The house is a mess and I am exhausted. My head hurts. Carolynn seems pretty happy about the whole thing. I need a nap.  The weather is still rainy, but it is warmer today. Maybe later we will go hiking or something. I need to go to the library. Well, that is all for now.   Well, are you coming or not?   In the French R.S.V.P., what does the “R” stand for?

      So Carolynn says that seven girls are coming to her party tomorrow. Plus her and Catherine that is  nine giggly girls in one house . Carolynn is cleaning up, and then we will put up the decorations. She got Hello Kitty stuff. We are ordering pizza for her party and I am going to bake cupcakes tomorrow when I get home from biology class. I would bake them today, but I don’t have anywhere to store them that Catherine the Piggy can’t get to. Carolynn is very excited. I don’t know if all the girls she says are coming, but I do know a few are, so she’ll be glad.   I am writing a paper for my English class on how Marilyn Monroe has been influencing culture even though she is dead. I was going to do my paper on Elvis, but I decided to do this one instead. Not much else happening here in Kenosha. The weather is still crappy. I have laundry to do and homework too.   ***************************************************  Wise Words   If you think nobody cares, try missing a few payments.

       Big TV night.  You might think that our whole life is about TV, but you would be only partly right. Anyway, tonight was a brand new  Friends . Only two more  Friends  ever. It is sad. How does Janice keep coming back in the weirdest places? I hope Ross and Rachel end up together. It has to work out for them. I know it is just a show, but it is important.   Then on  Survivor  ( actually they came on at the same time, and really I watched Survivor first ), Alicia got the old heave-ho. I can not believe Shi-Ann pulled that one out of the hat. I was so glad for her. It broke down those alliances. I hope that this stirs up some trouble. It makes it more interesting. I do hope they kick out Boston Rob. He thinks he is the king of Survivor.  Well, today was okay. The weather was kind of crappy. All this rain will be good for the grass and my veggie garden. My politics class was canceled today. It kind of sucked that I drove all the way down there, but what can you do? Anyway, I have confirmed that at least two giggly girls are coming to Carolynn’s party on Saturday. She still contends that five or six are coming. I hope she has a nice birthday party. The school called about getting Catherine is Kindergarten today. I’ll have to take her sometime in the middle of May.  ------------------------------------------------------------  I Wish I Were There   What is the name of the national park established in 1890 that contains many peaks of the Sierra Nevada range, giant sequoia tress, and waterfalls.

      Well, today is Carolynn’s 8th Birthday. Her class sang her happy birthday. She went to the orthodontist. She gets her braces on June 2. I made her shrimp for dinner. She still insists that five or six girls are coming to her party on Saturday. We’ll see how that goes. I am cleaning the carpet in the living room so if girls do come here, they can camp out on the floor.   Tonight on American Idol, I was shocked. I can not believe that the three best ones were in the bottom three. And I can’t believe that Jennifer Hudson got kicked out.  Who the hell is voting?  I thought, and apparently so did they, that this was a singing competition not a popularity contest. It is just unbelievable. I think George Huff had the right idea when he joined their group. I am still shocked. John Stevens was the worst. Diana Degarmo and Jasmine Trias were worse than those girls. Even George Huff was worse. I can not believe it. I just can’t.  I signed up for my summer and fall classes today. This summer I am taking the other half of the history class I am taking now. I am also taking a humanities class called American Decades. And I am taking Introduction to Sociology. The history and the sociology are online classes. Then in the fall I am taking Political Systems. That should be my last class before I move away from here. And if all my classes transfer, I will have 40 credits when I move. Before I know it I will have a college degree.   :)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~:)~  Fruity Question   What is a variety of peach with no fuzz?

      Tonight was Barry Manilow night on American Idol. Diana Degarmo was pretty good tonight. George Huff was not having his best night. Jennifer Hudson and Latoya London were great as always. Jasmine Trias wasn’t wearing a flower in her hair today. Maybe it helped. She was pretty good today too. Carolynn voted for her. John Stevens needs to go. He sounded okay, but I still think a cardboard box has more personality than he does. Fantasia Barrino just blew me away. I voted for her. I know Phillip would have too. Her little girl had those cute little braids with the little beads. I always liked little black girls’ hair like that. White girls could never do that.  Today the weather took a turn for the worst. It didn’t get up to 50 degrees outside and it was cloudy and rainy. The dogs got all soaked outside. Carolynn got the cutest pink cowboy boots from my mom today. Tomorrow is her birthday. I can’t believe she’ll be 8. We got her a Spongebob Barbie. It actually has Patrick on it. She got this stuffed Beagle that has a big head and a tiny body. She got a Clay Aiken CD single. I don’t know why since she has his whole album. And she got  Cheaper By The Dozen  on DVD all for her birthday. That isn’t all she wanted. She had a heck of a list. She also wants The  Haunted Mansion  on DVD and the American Idol Season 3 album. But she can’t have everything. She is going to want Kimberly Locke’s album when it comes out in a couple of weeks. She is going to want a lot of souvenirs when we go on vacation next month. If I gave her everything she wanted, she’d be the biggest spoiled brat ever. My mom sent her $8 in a birthday card and $5 in an Easter card that she put in our “Tennessee Here We Come” savings coffee can. She is planning a sleepover for the weekend, but if that doesn’t pan out, she wants to go bowling. I hope it works out for her. It would be sad if no one came to her party. She insisted on having it. I tried to talk her into something else. But she can be very stubborn, and she can get her way sometimes. The catch is she has to keep the downstairs clean for her birthday and she couldn’t get as many presents. We’ll see.   Well, Do  You  Know?

      Carolynn went back to school today. I went to my history class today. After we got home, Catherine and I planted our vegetable garden. We planted lettuce, carrots, peas, and green beans. The weather has been very odd today. It was in the 70’s this morning. It’s steadily been dropping all day and been very windy and cloudy. Tomorrow I have my politics class. Nothing else exciting happening here.  :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(  Just For Sarah   I got a box of chocolates for my sister……………It was a great trade!!

      Today was another beautiful day in Kenosha, temperatures in the mid-80’s. We went out and made the most of it since it doesn’t happen very often. Before it was cold, and soon it will be hot and humid. We got the yard all cleaned up. The girls planted some Bachelor’s Buttons in some little pots. I planted some Black Eyed Susans. Sometime this week I will get out and plant my veggies. It was really windy today. But we got the yard cleaned and weeded and raked up and got the lawn fertilized. We had some burritos for dinner. Phillip put his old tires back on his car. That is about it.  :):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):):)~  I Knew It!

      Well, it was another beautiful day in Kenosha. There was a massive thunderstorm last night. Thunder, lightning, rain and hail- it was very loud. But then today it was nice and sunny and warm, in the 70’s most of the day. We are expecting another big storm tonight, but tomorrow it is supposed to get up to 80. I bought some seeds to plant today. I did really well with peas, green beans, and tomatoes last year, so I got some peas and green beans today. I’ll probably buy some little tomato plants soon. I also am trying carrots and lettuce this time. If everything grows I will have a nice salad.   I took the girls shopping for new sandals to wear on our Hee-Haw Vacation next month. We went to the Sears to have Phillip’s tires looked at. He needs new ones. He’ll have to take off his fancy rims and put his old rims and tires on until we can get him some new tires for his fancy rims. I had my biology class today. The test wasn’t as scary as I thought it was going to be. I had studied enough. Phillip watched his Kill Bill Vol. 1. He said it was kind of funny, but very bloody. He now wants to see Vol. 2. He also got the last Matrix movie on DVD. I just don’t understand those, but he sure liked them.   Phillip said that he saw Elvis have some kind of a seizure earlier. The dog looks okay to me now, he is begging at me because I am eating a sandwich, but I will call the vet on Monday and talk to her. Priscilla seems fine too. She is also hoping I accidentally drop this sandwich.

      I had a history test today. It was the easiest test I ever took in my life. First of all, it was multiple choice and True/False. But what made it even easier was that my instructor gave out a list of all the questions he was going to use on Monday, so I had plenty of time to look up the answers and remember them. Tomorrow I have a biology test. I seriously do not believe that it will be nearly as easy. That one will be a little scary actually.   We had some sandwiches for dinner. The weather was beautiful today. It got up to 80 degrees out today. Carolynn and Catherine played outside all day. Now we are having old movie night. We watched  Ziegfeld Girl  from 1941 with Judy Garland. It was black and white and not that good. Then we watched  For Me And My Gal  from 1942. It also had Judy Garland and was Gene Kelly’s very first movie. It was black and white too, but it was a better movie.  \|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|\|  Ever Wonder…………..

      Today I went to the commissary for groceries. Phillip got  Kill Bill Vol. 1  on DVD. He hasn’t watched it yet. The weather was great. It got up to 72 degrees out. Tonight was American Idol.  JON PETER LEWIS IS OUT!!!!  It was about time people stopped voting him in because of how he looks, and started voting on talent. Apparently it is a family consensus that Fantasia Barrino is going to take this thing. I definitely think so.  Then on Survivor, ( Big night in our house, Survivor and American Idol in the same night! ) Kathy got voted off. I really dislike Boston Rob. I hope he doesn’t win. It was nice of him to let everyone have their letters, but everyone has their moments. It was good for his game so I am sure that is why he did it, not out of the goodness of his heart. I wish they could have voted him off. I wish the other players would get a grip and see that he and those two little chicks of his are going to win if they don’t hurry up and vote them off. Friends was a couple of repeats. I think we are getting down to the wire here. I can’t wait to see how it turns out.  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  Tax Day    A fine is a tax for doing wrong. A tax is a fine for doing well.

      I haven’t been having a good week. I have two tests coming up this week and have been studying and I keep forgetting things. I was supposed to go to a party for my friend Mary on Monday and I completely spaced it with my nose in a biology book. Then yesterday I for got to write here in my daily newspaper, once again with my nose in a biology book. I would have forgotten today, with my nose in a history book this time, but I took some time out to watch American Idol. I can’t believe that they canceled it yesterday. Carolynn was so sad. It was good today. Everyone was just okay except Fantasia Barrino. Carolynn liked Jennifer Hudson. She also said Jon Peter Lewis sounded like he needed to cough. It got up into the 60’s outside today. It was nice. Too bad I was inside all day studying. Carolynn is planning a sleep over for next weekend. I can’t believe that she will be 8 already. Well, that is it today.   I Should Have Known   Everybody has a photographic memory. Some just don’t have film.

      I turned in my history paper today. I managed to edit in down to 8 pages from 12 pages. I wasn’t sure how much my instructor wanted. One of his handouts said 4 to 6 pages, but another one said 6 to 10. Anyway, I turned in 8 so I should be fine. It has been cold all day, not even getting to 40 degrees outside. I thought it was supposed to be spring time. Phillip is off today since he had duty this weekend. That not much else happening.

       Easter Story   By Carolynn Angelica Dennen        We got ready for Easter. My mom hard-boiled the eggs. We dyed the eggs. After that we went to a parade.       “A bunny!” my sister yelled.       “No, it’s a rabbit.” I said.       “Oh.” My sister said.      Then we went home. We went to bed. Then I woke up at midnight. My sister came in my room. I heard something on the grass. We peeked out the window.       “ THE…. ”      “Shhhh!” I said.      “Let’s go and hunt for eggs.” my sister said.      “No.”       We heard the door open. Then something hopped in.       “Hurry! Lay down quick!”      The next morning we told mom and dad that we saw the Easter bunny. We ran down stairs. We saw eggs hidden all around the room. Our Easter baskets were hiding too.        “Let’s hunt and find eggs.”

      I hope everyone is having a nice Easter. The girls have been hiding plastic Easter eggs all over the house all day. I have been working on my history paper which is due tomorrow.

      So today was Easter at our house. Phillip won’t be home until tomorrow night. I hate it when he has duty on the weekend. We colored a few eggs, we had a ham, and the girls hunted for some plastic eggs. It has been cold and windy all day today.

      Well, I went to my politics class today. Not much to tell about that since I was only there 10 minutes before our instructor canceled class for the rest of the day. Catherine wasn’t too happy about that since that meant that she only got to be at school for about 15 minutes. I made chicken fried steak for dinner. Today was Carolynn’s first day on Spring break. Too bad it is cloudy and chilly outside today. She spent all day in her room watching movies and reading Junie B. Jones books.  Tonight was Survivor. I can not believe Lex got the boot. I felt sorry for Boston Rob last week and now I hate him again. I wish they had voted off Amber. This game has so many twists and turns.  I predicted that the Friends with the Prom Video would be the number one Friends. I was right. It is a good episode. I hope that this means that new Friends will be starting next week. I am still upset that it is the last season, but I am dying to see what is going to happen.  __________________________________________________________  Historical Nuts   Name the city in Massachusetts where 19 so called witches were hanged in 1692?

      Today was a busy day. I had my history class. We finally finished studying Romans and have moved on to Medieval times ( Not the restaurant, but the actual time in history ). Then I had to fill out some paper work to get Catherine into Kindergarten. The cut off date for starting Kindergarten here is September 1, but in San Diego, where we shall be moving half way through the next school year, the cut off date is much later, after Catherine’s birthday. So they are going to test her and stuff here to see if she can go to Kindergarten early. However, I don’t think she is going to pass the tests. Not that she isn’t smart, but she doesn’t pay attention and focus on anything. So I think she might have to go to Kindergarten a year late. But we are giving it a try. She might surprise us. I had a parent-teacher conference with Carolynn’s teacher today. Now here is the exact opposite of Catherine. Carolynn got all A’s, is in the third grade reading group, and is a great student. Then the girls had dentist appointments. They had no cavities.   Well, it is American Idol vote off night. Camile Velasco has joined Leah Labelle, Matt Rodgers, and Amy Adams in the losers circle.  It was about time!!  She can go back to working at the IHOP in Maui. I can’t believe that Jasmine Trias and Diana Degarmo were in the bottom three instead of John Stevens and Jon Peter Lewis. It is all because some people vote on looks instead of talent ( You know who you are.

      I went to my politics class today. Then after that I went shopping and bought a new washer. It’s a Maytag so hopefully, like the commercial says, it will last a long time and keep that repairman bored. And then, in true military wife fashion, I got it home, out of my truck, down into the basement, and hooked up by myself, even though the whole time Carolynn kept asking me why I didn’t just wait for daddy to do it. What if it had broke while he was out to sea somewhere? Should I have waited for him to get home before I washed clothes? I got a really good deal on the washer, but the NEX doesn’t deliver to Kenosha. So that was it. I bought a washer and I installed it. Carolynn is just shocked. I guess she doesn’t remember all those times in California I had to fend for myself. She’ll learn soon enough. Phillip won’t be home until tomorrow, and it would probably be afternoon before he could get to it. And now by that time, I’ll have the laundry done.  Anyway, Phillip is at his friend’s house today ( reason I installed washer myself ). They probably just talked about cars the whole time so I am glad that I didn’t have to hear about it. We watched American Idol. It was Elton John night. If you are going to sing Elton John songs, you better do a good job. He is a legend. Even Catherine has one of his Cds. Okay, so it is The Lion King soundtrack, but still. I voted for George Huff. Carolynn voted for Jennifer Hudson. And I think that after Phillip watches it in the morning, he would have voted for Fantasia Barrino. I haven’t been wrong about Phillip’s vote yet. I still think that Camile Valasco is the crappiest one. Jon Peter Lewis sounded flat and kind of crappy ( sorry Sarah ). John Stevens was just horrible. Elton John said he really needed personality to do “Crocodile Rock”, and John Stevens has the personality of a sponge.   Well, nothing else exciting. I can’t be doing cool stuff like watching the dogs run around outside or spraying the weeds with Roundup because it has been too cold. But today it got up to 72 and I couldn’t be out enjoying it because I had homework and wash to do. Probably when it is the weekend it will be cold and raining.  ************************************************  Just Remember………   Eagles may soar, but weasels don’t get sucked into jet engines.

      So there is a creepy guy in one of my classes that I am pretty sure has been trying to pick me up. It is really kind of gross since he is a kid, like around 20 years old or so. He told me I looked cute in my short pants, he has taken to sitting next to me in class and asking me dumb questions (“Have you ever been to Las Vegas?”) or saying things like “nice purse”. Today he was going on about how he likes the color of my hair. Apparently telling him I am old and married makes no difference. I find the whole thing king of weird. I am way to old for that.  Well the washer broke. It was a sad thing. I have had that washer since before we had Catherine. Tomorrow I will have to get a new one. I had been hoping that the one I have would last until we moved. But what can you do? You have to have clean clothes.  Well, nothing else interesting or exciting happened today. That is life here in Wisconsin.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Saw It On A Bumper Sticker   I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe.

      We went to dinner at the Rainforest Café. My friend Cari gave us a gift card for there. It was good. The girls wanted to eat this dessert they had there called Volcano. It is this huge ice cream brownie sundae. But they give you so much food that there was just no room. I had crab cakes that should have been called crab mountains. Phillip had a huge burger. They even gave the girls a bunch of food (hot dogs and chicken nuggets). I was so stuffed. So not much else happening on a Saturday. I went to the video store last night. We didn’t get any videos because they didn’t have any. Like I said, there is nothing else to do in Kenosha on a weekend. Well, that’s all.

       Survivor Update  As much as I hated Boston Rob, I really felt bad for him when he lost his girl to the other tribe on tonight’s episode. He really did seem to care about her. I think I even saw a few tears. He was just so upset. And I really thought he was just using her to get ahead. Well, maybe that is how it started. I didn’t want Amber to get voted out. I wanted her to stay with her man. And I really wanted Jerri to go anyway. I have always hated her. I was so glad that she got voted out. And now Boston Rob can have a chance to get his girl back. It’s like a Survivor Romeo and Juliet. All I all, it was a pretty good Survivor.  So I took Carolynn to her book fair today. She got a diary and a boxed set of her favorite Junie B. Jones books. She got a couple of books for her sister too. We went to the Sam’s Club to pick up some groceries. We got some dinner on the way home. I have been still working on my school work. I thought I was on vacation. Oh well.  The number 2 Friends episode was on today. It was the one where Ross and Rachel finally kiss. It is my favorite episode. I predict that the number 1 episode where be the one where they watch the prom video and then Ross and Rachel become a couple. I can’t wait to see how it ends. I think Ross and Rachel are going to get back together.   {}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}  Greek Philosophy   Socrates died from drink a potion made from what poisonous plant?

I know that is her favorite place to eat. She just had a nice vacation and hope my dad buys her something good.  Anyways, nothing much is going on today. It has been raining all day as usual. Carolynn has the day off school. Tomorrow will be the first day she will be back since before vacation. She only has a week and a half until she finishes the second grade. I start school again on June 7. I am taking history, sociology, and humanities this summer but I only have to go to one. The others are online. Phillip’s mom and little brother will be arriving on the ninth. We have an exciting month planned. Carolynn gets her braces on Wednesday. She is excited for some reason. Catherine takes another Kindergarten entrance exam on Wednesday as well. She should not have any trouble. My truck’s antilock braking system went out so I am taking it in tomorrow so it can be fixed.

      It's another rainy day here in Kenosha. There is not much going on. I am making navy bean soup for dinner. I got this entertaining email from my friend Trish and since I did not have much to say here, I thought I would share it with you.   Just a word of warning though, it contains some harsh language and children who may not know this kind of word should not read it.       SHIT -The Most Functional Word in the English Language   That's right. Shit might just be the most functional word in the English language.    Consider: You can get shit-faced, be shit out of luck, or have shit for brains. With a little effort, you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit, or be asked to shit or get off the pot. You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, and tell others to eat shit. Some people know their shit, while others cannot tell the difference between shit and shinola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, and crazy shits. There is bullshit, horseshit, and chicken shit. You can throw shit, sling shit, catch shit, shoot the shit, or duck when the shit hits the fan. You can give a shit, or serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit, and some days are just plain shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things can look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit. You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the wrong shit or a lot of weird shit. You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit, or find yourself up shit creek without a paddle. Sometimes everything you touch turns to shit and other times you fall in a bucket of shit and come out smelling like a rose. When you stop to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of the English language. In addition, remember, once you know your shit, you do not need to know anything else!   Just wanted you to know that I do give a shit and I hope you have a nice day, without a bunch of shit. However, if you happened to catch a load of shit from some shit head...........  Well, shit happens!

      Well, I have not written in a few days. I will catch you up though. Thursday morning I took my mom and sister to the airport in Nashville. Wednesday night was an adventure though. The toilet over flowed and was dripping on the guy downstairs. When I called down there all the guy did was give us a complimentary plunger. Then when my sister went down there to get some more towels to mop up the mess, the guy was catching our toilet water in pans. Therefore, he moved our room. Then my sister was laughing so hard she fell off the bed and was stuck between the bed and the wall. It was so funny! My mom and sister got home fine on Thursday. They had a layover in Denver for a long time. We got on the road after that. We stopped for lunch at the Jack In The Box. I had my first Jumbo Jack in almost three years. It was delicious. I got to Indianapolis about four on Thursday. We decided to stay at my friends Cari’s on Thursday night because of traffic and storms and we arrived home finally on Friday around two. It was a long vacation and a lot of driving but it was great. I took my film to be developed at the Wal-Mart. If you go to www.jackdaniels.com and look at the May 24, 2004 tour pictures, you can see us on the tour. Well, not much since I got home. We got some groceries and are getting ready for Phillip’s mom and little brother to visit. They get here on the ninth. It should be a fun time. That is all for now.

      Well, tomorrow we drop my mom and my sister at the airport and we will be heading on home to Wisconsin. We have had trouble getting some sleeping in this hotel. The first night we were here, the phone rang at 3 am. The person on the other end asked if this was room 304. It is 204. Then this morning early, someone was banging on the door. When my sister got up and opened it, the guy asked her where Dave was. Who the hell is Dave? Today was fun though. We had our last Waffle House breakfast. They have some great hash browns there. I will miss those. After our breakfast, we went for a cruise on a riverboat. It was called the General Jackson. It was fun. It was a bit windy. It had a big paddle wheel and everything. After that, we ate lunch at a place called Shoney’s. My mom said it was mentioned in an Alan Jackson song. Anyway, they had a buffet kind of a thing. They bring the meat you get the soup, salad, and sides. We tried greens. Carolynn and I didn’t like them but my sister did. We tried fried okra. No one liked that. So my mom got some mashed potatoes and some brown gravy to go with her chicken fried steak. Carolynn decided that she wanted some too. She went to the buffet to get some. She got the potatoes, but they were changing out some of the stuff and had apparently moved the gravy. She went looking for it and accidentally put chocolate pudding on her mashed potatoes. It was so funny. I helped her get some mashed potatoes and gravy. After lunch, we came back to the motel and I took the girls swimming. Tomorrow it is all over for Nashville.  We ended up watching the  American Idol  final tonight. I did not get to watch and vote last night. However, we saw who won. I knew it would be Fantasia Barrino, or as Catherine says Fantasia Burrito. I always liked her.  No more  American Idol  until next year.    American Idols…   Who were the three American Idols?   Answer   Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, and Fantasia Barrino

      We started our day with another adventure to the Waffle House. It was Sunshine’s day off today. However, we did get to see the Orkin man run right into a door that said pull. Sure are some interesting people here in Tennessee. Yesterday I saw a sign that read “  Chicks and Other Foul $1.00  .” When I drove through the Taco Bell the other day, I said to the woman I wanted three crunchy tacos and she asked if I wanted those hard or soft. Not a lot of education here I expect.  Today we went to the capitol building. Nashville is the capitol of Tennessee for those of you who did not know. The capitol building is very cool, but it is on a hill and you have to walk up a million stairs to get there. I got a heck of a workout today. Also on the hill were the graves of President James Polk and his wife. That makes two presidential graves I have seen this week. After our workout, we went to the Parthenon. No, we did not go to Greece. Nashville has built an exact replica. It was very cool. They had a nice art gallery filled with Greek pictures and statues. Carolynn giggled the whole time because there was a lot of naked. Then Catherine was stuck on the potty there. She was afraid because the toilet flushed itself. Therefore, she had to be rescued. She was very traumatized.  (When Elvis got suck on a potty here in Tennessee, he died.)  I however laughed until I cried because it was too funny. It was just another interesting adventure in Nashville. After we got Catherine off the potty, we went once again to the Wild Horse Saloon. No dancing today but we did try the fried pickles. They tasted very vinegary. Maybe my Aunt Chris would like them since I think she likes those salt and vinegar potato chips. I did not like them. No one at our table did. I had a great bowl of chili for lunch though. Then we changed and went to the Grand Ole Opry. We saw a whole bunch of country people. We saw Porter Wagoner, Hal Ketchum, Ricky Skaggs, Connie Smith, Rebecca Lynn Howard, the Del McCoury Band, Bill Anderson, and Lorrie Morgan. I liked Rebecca Lynn Howard best. She was funny. Catherine was so bored and drove me crazy. Hal Ketchum had his little daughter on stage with him. She was about Catherine’s age and very cute. Tomorrow we are going on a riverboat ride on the General Jackson Riverboat. It is going to be fun.    Did You Know……   The Grand Ole Opry is actually a live radio show.

      We started our day at the Waffle House again. We got Sunshine, our waitress, to bring us a bowl of grits. They tasted like crap and it felt like tapioca pudding. Carolynn liked them. She is so weird. Then we went to Lynchburg, Tennessee to visit the Jack Daniels Distillery. I think Catherine got a little tipsy from the fumes. We didn't get any whiskey there though because it is in a dry county. They had a couple of commemorative bottles that they sold there, but the cheapest one was $31. I do not drink whiskey. Then we went to down town Lynchberg. The whole town is about as big as the block I live on. We walked all the way around it. We got a free Jack Daniels shot glass. We ate lunch in little diner. Then we came back to the hotel. That was an adventure in itself because Lynchberg is about an hour away from Nashville out in the woods and I got lost on the way back. The kids are horrible little pains in the car. I wanted to leave them on the side of the road somewhere. I did not though. When we eventually got back to our motel, Carolynn and Sarah went swimming. Then we went to the Wild Horse Saloon again. They were having an American Idol-like contest for hee-haw singers. We did a little dancing and had some dinner. Sarah was yelling at people out the window of my truck. HEE HAW!! She is insane. Well, that is it for today. Tomorrow we are going to the Grand Ole Opry. We will be seeing some country people. More Hee-haws for us.    Amusing Things To Say In The Car   What do you call a cow in a twister?  A milk shake  What do you call a cow who does not give milk?

      Well today was a big day here in Nashville. We had breakfast at the Waffle House. The bus boy fell asleep and when the waitress, whose name was Sunshine, yelled at him “Hey Grandpa!”, he jumped up and said “Where am I?” then proceeded to clear the tables. It is very interesting here in Nashville. After our adventure at breakfast, we went to the home of President Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States. It was very cool. He had a very cool home with lots of land. Then we went to downtown Nashville to check out some hee-haw shops. The girls got some cowgirl hats. We went to the Wild Horse Saloon again for lunch. The Catherine, Carolynn, Sarah and my mom learned another line dance. Then we went to the Opry Mills mall. We spent most of the time in the Nike Outlet. We walked around only about two-thirds of the mall. We came back to our motel and the girls took a swim. Tomorrow we are going to see a horse race farm and maybe Loretta Lynn’s Haunted Mansion. So far, the vacation has been fun. I feel bad because I do not have lots of money to be spending and my mom has to buy a lot of the stuff. However, one day I am going to take her on vacation and have lots of money to spend.    Nashville Trivia   What is the name of the professional football team that plays in Nashville?

      After two days of travel, we finally arrived in Nashville, Tennessee. I found my mom and my sister at the airport when I finally found the airport. We found our motel without any trouble. After we got to the motel, we got all our stuff unloaded. There was a lot of stuff. My mom brought more stuff for Carolynn and Catherine than for herself. Then we went to the Wild Horse Saloon. They had good barbecued stuff. I had a barbecued pork sandwich that was huge and very tasty. My mom and sister and my children did some line dancing there. It was pretty hee-haw. It was the perfect way to start our Hee-Haw Vacation.    Semper Fidelis   (The Final Day)   What is the name of the Marine who was the first American to orbit the earth?   Answer   John H.

      Last time I drove here to Cari’s house in Indiana, it took me just under four hours. Today it took me just over seven. I hope that that is not a sign of things to come. It took me three hours just to get through Chicago. I went three hours on a freeway and only got up to 30 miles an hour. It was not a pleasant journey. Nevertheless, I am here now. Tomorrow I have to pick up my mom and my sister in Nashville. Then we can let the Hee-Haw begin!

      Well, Catherine took her test today. They said she did really well. We will know the results sometime next week. She will be tested for four-year-old kindergarten on June 2. That is the same day Carolynn gets her braces. So tomorrow, we leave on our vacation. The girls are so excited. Carolynn is happy that she will be out of school for a week. Today was  Papa John’s Pizza  day at her school, so she is leaving on a good note. When we get back she will only have a week and a half left of school. She gets out on June 9th. Phillip’s mom gets here that same day.  I am so excited about our vacation. I am sure there will be lots of cool stuff to see in Nashville. Tomorrow we are staying at my friend Cari’s house. She lives just outside of Indianapolis. The weather sure is looking better for our vacation. It is going to be great. Phillip barbecued us some chicken for dinner. It was delicious. He even made us pancakes for breakfast. I think he is going to miss us when we are gone.    Semper Fidelis   (Day 5)   When were the Marine’s official colors, scarlet and gold, established?

      Tomorrow is Catherine’s entrance exam for Kindergarten. She is very excited about going to the big girl school. She has been reciting her ABC’s all day. I do not think she has the social skills to pass. However, they told me today they have another program called 4-year-old Kindergarten that she can get into if she cannot get into regular Kindergarten. I do not know why someone did not tell me this before.    Tonight was  American Idol . I hoped that Jasmine would be the one kicked out. It is just shocking that she made it as far as she did. Why do they have to drag out these episodes? They took a whole hour to do what would have taken me minutes. This show makes me so mad sometimes. As Carolynn says,  “Just shut your pie-hole and get on with the results!”  Finally, after all that, Jasmine finally went home. The final showdown between Diana and Fantasia will be next week.  Nobody tell us what happens, since we will be on vacation!  I will be able to see it when I get home on Friday.  Tonight was the last episode of  Law and Order  with Jerry Orbach. I liked him. He had been "Detective Lenny Briscoe" for a long time.  Law and Order  is one of my favorite shows. I just love those crime dramas. I watch eight a week: three  Law and Order ’s, two  CSI ’s,  Without a Trace ,  Cold Case , and  Navy NCIS . In the fall there will be a third  CSI ,  CSI: New York . That is nine crime drama’s each week. In addition, I watch  Cold Case Files  on A&E. Recently they added Court TV to our able service so I have been watching that too. There are other true crime shows on A&E or the Discovery Channel and other channels. Sometimes I watch those too.      Semper Fidelis   (Day 4)   When did the Marine’s first begin allowing women to join?   Answer   August 8, 1918- But only to do clerical work. They did not become a real part of the Marine’s until June 12, 1948.

      Do you know what are good?  Ritz Chips . I got some  Sour Cream and Onion Ritz Chips  at the store, I have been eating them the last couple of days, and they are good. Do you know what else are good?  Kudos - Peanut Butter granola bars. They are yummy. Speaking of products that are good…  Mr.Clean Magic Eraser  works really well. My friend Trish suggested I try it to get Catherine’s markering off my banister and walls and floor and it worked great.  Phillip and I have been playing  Need for Speed Underground  for the  Playstation II . We have been stuck on this same race for like three days. Phillip gets very mad at video games when they do not cooperate. It is a six-lap race and we can stay in first about five laps before some stupid thing happens and then we lose. It is not fair.  Tonight was  American Idol . I still cannot believe that Jasmine is in the final three. I really believe Latoya deserved it more. I don’t think Jasmine should have been in the top four even. It is not as if I think she is horrible, I just think other people were better. I read online somewhere that they logged more votes for Jasmine from the state of Hawaii than there are people living in Hawaii. I also read that the phone company there reported that some phone numbers in Hawaii logged more than 100 calls per phone to vote for her. It is not fair. Anyways, she had better be gone tomorrow! I think the final two have to be Fantasia and Diana. So tonight, each of them sang three songs. First, it was Jasmine. She was okay. Then it was Fantasia, she was great as always. Finally, Diana was pretty darn good too. End the end we all voted for Fantasia. She is the best. I called and voted a bunch of times too.

      Well, it was nice and warm today. It got up into the 80’s. We went to the park. Phillip barbecued hamburgers for dinner. We watched the  American Idol  special. If Diana or Fantasia wins, Carolynn and I will be seeing them live. If Jasmine wins, we are seeing Hilary Duff. Only a few more days and we will be leaving on our Hee Haw Vacation. We are so excited! Catherine has to take her Kindergarten entrance exam on Thursday. Well, not much else is going on here today. It’s just Monday.

      Well, it was a nice day outside. We went hiking. We cleaned the house. Or as Carolynn would say we “clun” the house. I don’t know how many times I have to tell her that “clun” is not a word. We rearranged some of the furniture and the kids thought we were nuts. On Friday we leave on our vacation. We can’t wait.

      Carolynn and I went and had our toenails done today in a lovely shade of pink. That way we can show off our toes on our vacation. Just one week from today, we will be in Nashville. Nothing else exciting going on today. Phillip barbecued hotdogs for dinner.    Anchor’s Aweigh   (The Final Day)  I got this from the Navy website and found it amusing.   The following is being transmitted around the Internet as an event that really took place, but it never happened. It is simply an old joke like those found in popular magazines:     Believe it or not...this is the transcript of an actual radio conversation between a US naval ship and Canadian authorities off the coast of Newfoundland in October 1995. The Radio conversation was released by the Chief of Naval Operations on Oct. 10, 1995.     US Ship:   Please divert your course 0.5 degrees to the south to avoid a collision.    CND reply :  Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to the South to avoid a collision.    US Ship:   This is the Captain of a US Navy Ship. I say again, divert your course.    CND reply:   No. I say again, you divert YOUR course!    US Ship:    THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER USS CORAL SEA*, WE ARE A LARGE WARSHIP OF THE US NAVY. DIVERT YOUR COURSE NOW!!     CND reply:   This is a lighthouse. Your call.      * Note: USS Coral Sea (CV 43) was decommissioned and scrapped 2 July 1993. Other ships' names appearing have been USS Missouri (BB 63) which was decommissioned on 31 March 1992 and USS Nimitz (CVN 68) which is an active ship.

      What an exciting day! Well, not really but wouldn’t that be nice? It rained all day. (What else is new?) We went to the  Taco Bell  for lunch. We went to the grocery store. We got the oil changed in Phillip’s car. I got everything ready for vacation. I took the girls to get haircuts so we can see their evil faces. Phillip made  Hamburger Helper  for dinner. That was it. There was nothing good on TV to report on. Catherine is watching  A Bugs Life  and Carolynn is watching  Daddy Daycare . I was playing slots on pogo.com.

      I have just found out that they have  Jack In The Box  in Nashville. I haven’t had a Jumbo Jack in almost three years. I am so all over that. Jumbo Jacks and Mystery Meat tacos! I can’t wait. It makes my vacation just that much better.   I got my truck all ready for vacation. The oil is changed and it is clean. The girls got some new shades. We are hoping it will be sunny in Tennessee. We leave one week from tomorrow. We are spending one night in Indianapolis, then we will be arriving in Tennessee next Saturday. We can’t wait.   I am glad that Rupert won the million on  Survivor . Next seasons  Survivor  looks pretty good. So no more  Survivor  talk until September. No more  Friends , no more  Survivor ,  American Idol  is almost over and making me mad.

      Just a two things I learned yesterday that I wanted to share with you before we get on with today’s news. The first is,  NEVER  make tuna sandwiches for dinner unless you put the cat out first if you value your legs. The other thing is  Eclipse  gum is gross. I have to have gum all the time. I have breath issues. I worry I have offensive breath even though I know I brush my teeth. So anyway, I decided to try  Eclipse  gum. I got the lemon flavor and the cherry flavor. They were so nasty! They each tasted like  Halls  cough drops.  EWWW!  There are good brands though. I usually like  Orbit  or  Trident .   Anyway, today was my last final. It was not bad. After it was over, I took my books back to the bookstore. Nearly $500 worth of books and I got $120 back. It figures. I had to drive Phillip’s car to school today. My truck is getting an oil change to be ready for vacation. I do not like driving his car. It is too little and my head practically hits the windshield because I have to have the seat moved so close to reach the pedals. The seat in my truck has more adjustments. The weather was great most of the day. It got into the 80’s. Now it is cloudy and raining.  There were all kinds of famous folks on  Blue’s Clues  today. I did not know that kid’s shows were getting so fancy. Catherine just loves to watch  Blue’s Clues  and  Dora the Explorer . She also is a big fan of  Arthur . Carolynn is more of a  SpongeBob Squarepants  type of girl. She also likes  Fairly OddParents  and she likes  Arthur  too. Mostly she loves  Survivor  and  American Idol .  I finally decided on whom to vote for on  Survivor . My first thought was to give it to Rupert. Everyone loves Rupert. Then I thought of Colby. He is a nice person, he is cute, and he practically gave the million to Tina in the Outback. Then I was watching all their pleas online. I liked Ethan’s idea of giving it all to charities since he already won. I liked Rob C.’s promise to split it with Rupert and take Big Tom out to dinner. Rob C. was a great player. I liked that Jenna L. said vote for Rupert. I did not want to give it to someone who already won, so I decided against Tina, Ethan, Richard, Jenna M., Amber and Boston Rob (They didn’t need 2 million in one week.) Therefore, I ended up voting for Rob C. He really was a great player and he did say he would share his million with Rupert so I picked him. Carolynn voted for Rupert because he was her favorite.  I finally saw the final  Friends . I got it on DVD today. It was cool because it was a special extended version so I saw extra stuff. I knew that Ross and Rachel would end up together. I have been predicting that for months.    I could not believe what happened on  American Idol  tonight! That is twice this season that America got it wrong. First, we lost Jennifer Hudson, now Latoya London was kicked off over Jasmine Trias. I am not saying Jasmine was horrible, just that everyone else was better. I am just shocked. I might have to go postal on the  American Idol  people for letting this happen. What are people thinking? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Anchor’s Aweigh   (Day 4)   Where is the United States Naval Academy located?

      Well, only 10 days left until we leave on our vacation to Nashville. All of us are packing our stuff little by little. We got a new suitcase. The girls got some swimming stuff. They got some coloring books to take with them. They are so excited. I am too. I got some new hats yesterday to take with me. I got plenty of film too. One of these days, I am going to get a digital camera.   Carolynn went on a field trip today. She went to a cultural festival in Milwaukee. She said it was cool. There were many Indians there and she bought a flute made out of a reed.  The weather is a bit cooler today. It was only around 60 degrees out and cloudy. It rained for a little while. I can’t wait to see if the weather is good in Nashville.   Tonight was disco night on  American Idol . We are down to four girls left. All the girls were good tonight. I think it might come down to Diana Degarmo and Fantasia Barrino. However, I think Fantasia is going to join Ruben and Kelly as American Idol. ( Though I think Clay actually came out on top over Ruben in the end. ) Phillip and I ended up voting for Fantasia. Carolynn voted for Diana Degarmo. I don’t think Jasmine is going to make it past tomorrow. We will see… ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()    Anchor’s Aweigh   (Day 3)   Who is the Secretary Of The Navy?

      There is not too much excitement around here. It is warm out, but very humid. Phillip is cleaning the basement. Catherine is outside playing. I have not decided on whom to vote for in  Survivor . Phillip decided on Rob C. Carolynn is still deciding too. Everyone is getting so excited about vacation. I hope the weather in Nashville is nice. It should be a nice trip there. I have to drive through Illinois and Indiana. I have done that before. My friend Cari lives near Indianapolis. There is not much to see between here and there. However, then I have to drive through Kentucky and into Tennessee. That should be more scenic. Phillip drove to Kentucky with his friend once and he said it was nice. Well, that is it for today. Tomorrow I have my English final and on Wednesday, I have my history final. Then that is it until the summer semester. Phillip’s mom will be here that week. She is excited about her visit. We are planning lots of fun stuff that week too. Our summer is starting with a bang.                        **********************************   Anchors Aweigh Day 2   How many aircraft carriers does the navy currently have in service?

      I hope all those mothers out there are having a nice day. Phillip has duty today so I am home alone. I have been cleaning all day. I got both girls rooms cleaned and my own as well. I cleaned the whole upstairs.   Tonight was the final  Survivor . I cannot believe Rupert was voted off. I liked him and hoped he would win. But instead Amber won. Not that it would have mattered. Both her and Boston Rob won in the end. I can't believe Boston Rob asked Amber to marry him. They are the first Survivor couple. How cute. I didn't care for the after party; Jerri stomping off, everyone was arguing and fighting like a bunch of babies. It is a game show for goodness sakes! It was nice that Amber gave Shii Ann the car. It was interesting all the love connections going on. I don't know who I will vote for to give the second million to. I'll probably look at their videos tomorrow.

      I took my Biology final today. It was not much fun. We went to Taco Bell for dinner. I am continuing my crusade against the education department. They want me to claim we make more money than we do because we are in the military. It is not right. Therefore, I am fighting. I am not giving up my education so they can give money for drug dealers and stuff to go. Anyway, I cleaned out Catherine’s room today. I found a whole lot of stuff she should not have had in there; crayons, markers, pens, pencils, chalk, glue, scissors, candy and other food wrappers, and a whole lot of trash. It was a mess. She has written all over the carpet, on the walls, and on her furniture. I got most of it off the walls and furniture. The other day I came down here and found she had colored all over the TV, a chair, on the stairs and on the banister. I got it off the TV, but it is marker on the bannister, carpet and chair. So for future reference, do not send Catherine any writing implements. That kid is trouble. Phillip is on duty so he went to work tonight and won't be back until tomorrow night. It will be final  Survivor  night tomorrow! Well, that is all for now.  ################################################  Hungry?   When and where was the first Taco Bell ever built?

      Well, I had my last history class today. I have my final on Wednesday at 8 am. I have a biology final tomorrow and my English final is due on Tuesday. Then I am out of school until June. I am very excited that it will be over. I will not have to make Catherine get up and get ready everyday. I do not know how I am going to get her to her own school on time if she starts Kindergarten this fall.  I am still sad about missing the last few minutes of the final  Friends  last night. I cannot believe the power went out. It was very windy last night and there was thunder and lightning. Now I have to wait until Tuesday to see how it ended. Remember, nobody tell me.  My mom sent the girls some little jewelry in the mail. She sent Catherine a  My Little Pony  bracelet and she sent Carolynn a bunch of little toe rings. She sent her some money to have her toes done at the beauty parlor. I am taking her next weekend so they will be ready for vacation. My mom sent me an Alabama CD. It will get me in the mood for vacation. Just two weeks from today, the girls and I will be on our way to Nashville. I cannot wait.   ````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````  Survivor Trivia   How many seasons of Survivor were there, what are they called and who won?   Answer  1.

      I had a busy day today. I had a doctor’s appointment this morning. Then I had my politics final this afternoon. My teacher graded them right away so I could know my grade for the class.  I got an A!  Then it was Science night at Carolynn’s school. Carolynn’s class had done a science project on recycling. They had made bird houses, and pencil holders out of milk cartons. Then they made us build bridges out of newspaper. They got ice cream and Catherine won a prize.  Then……….the final  Friends . This is what happened.  THE POWER WENT OUT!!!!!!!!!  I didn’t get to see the last few minutes. So no one tell me what happens. I can buy it on DVD on Tuesday. I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler had twins. I did cry like a big baby for the parts I saw. It’s pathetic. I cried over a TV show. But no one tell me the end, because I will see it on Tuesday. Anyway, on  Survivor , they kicked off Big Tom. Boston Rob and Amber each won cars. I think Boston Rob and Amber have this sewn up. I kind of hope Rupert wins. We'll find out on Sunday night.  **************************************************  Nothing to add here……..Shhhhh TV on.

      Today wasn’t that exciting. I went to history class. I came home. That was it. I have been studying for my politics final tomorrow. Phillip took the first half of his calculus final today. He takes the other half on Friday. I have an appointment to see my English teacher on Friday. I have the final for that on Monday or Tuesday and I have my history final on Wednesday. Plus I have my biology final on Saturday.   Well, we have been raising a vacation fund for a few months. We have been putting all of our extra money in a coffee can to save up. We are getting up in to the hundreds. We are selling back our school books this week so we can put more in. That way we can have plenty of money for our vacation to Nashville. We can’t wait.   So tonight on  American Idol , the bottom two was pretty predictable. I still think Fantasia is going to win this thing. Did you see how sweaty George was? He must have been really nervous. He must have known he was getting voted off. Now it is an all girl Idol! Next week it is Disco night on  American Idol . I can’t wait. The only bad thing is that when we get down to the last two, I will be on vacation. So I will be seeing the Grand Ole Opry while Fantasia and Latoya duke it out and one will be named the American Idol. That’s okay. We have DVR so I can see it when I get home. I’d rather be on vacation. I can’t wait to go to vacation. Tomorrow is the final  Friends . I am pretty sure I am going to cry like a blubbering idiot. I can’t remember a Thursday night with out  Friends . It has been my favorite show for so long. I will miss it. That’s all for today folks.  :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  Traveling Question   What is the official language of Ireland?

      Today was a pretty boring day. I went to my politics class. It was the last one. I have my final on Thursday. We are getting closer and closer to vacation time. It will be cool. Anyway, it is  American Idol  night. Everyone got to sing 2 songs tonight. It was a hard choice. Everyone sounded so good. Jasmine had her flower back. In the end, Carolynn and I voted for Fantasia Barrino. I couldn’t predict who Phillip would vote for. Probably Fantasia. I think she is going to win. Carolynn is saving up to go see them live this summer. They will be in Milwaukee July 22 or they will be in Chicago on August 5. We saw them in Chicago last summer and we saw Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken in Chicago too. The United Center is really nice on the inside. That is where the Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawk’s play. If we see it in Milwaukee, we would see it at the Bradley Center. That is where the Milwaukee Bucks play. I have never been there before.  My friend Trish said it snowed at her house last night.  SNOW IN MAY!  If it snowed here in May I'd be on the next plane home. Well, that is pretty much it. I have some studying to try and do.  .............................................................................................

      I am just wondering how many people even read this online newspaper. Am I doing it simply for my own amusement? Not that that would stop me, but I am just curious. Everyday I take time to write about our family, complain about the weather and hopefully keep you informed, and I even think up some trivia question or something. Sometimes Carolynn even writes and she is the slowest ever. She types at a snails pace.

      Well today was not very exciting. It is sunny out but it is cold and windy. The high for today has only been 49. Do you know what makes me hate the weather even worse?  Today in Apple Valley, California it was sunny with a high of 101. In San Diego, California it was sunny with a high of 99.  You all have the air conditioner on, I have the heater on. That is reason number 1 of why I hate living here. And I know those who are stuck out here with me agree. It is always better to be too warm than too cold. And it is always better to be in Southern California than pretty much anywhere else.  I went to the dentist today. It was exciting. Well, not really but it has to be done. The Navy pays for me and the girls to go once every six months. What I find odd about that is that they only make Phillip go once a year. Tomorrow I have a doctor’s appointment and my last American Politics class. On Thursday is our final. I plan on studying for that tonight as well as for the biology final I have on Saturday. Then I will study for the history and English finals I have next week. Then school is out until June.   Carolynn has entered some kind of science fair which we will be going to on Thursday. She said her project has something to do with milk cartons. Tonight she is looking forward to watching the American Idol Special. Well, that is about all there is for today.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Another Place With Better Weather Than Here   What is the name of the great desert, high in Asia, and over 500,000 square miles large?

      I stole this off of Trisha's page. I liked it and figured she wouldn't mind since her page went out of buisness. Besides, one can not stress the amazingness of military wives nearly enough.   The Difference   written by Colonel Steve Arrington 17th Training Wing, Vice Commander Goodfellow AFB San Angelo, TX from the Goodfellow Monitor 11 May ‘01   Over the years, I’ve talked a lot about military spouses...how special they are and the price they pay for freedom too. The funny thing about it, is most military spouses don’t consider themselves different from other spouses. They do what they have to do, bound together not by blood or merely friendship, but with a shared spirit whose origin is in the very essence of what love truly is. Is there truly a difference? I think there is. You have to decide for yourself.   Other spouses  get married and look forward to building equity in a home and putting down family roots.  Military spouses  get married and know they’ll live in base housing or rent, and their roots must be short so they can be transplanted frequently.   Other spouses  decorate a home with flair and personality that will last a lifetime.  Military spouses  decorate a home with flare tempered with the knowledge that no two base houses have the same size windows or same size rooms. Curtains have to be flexible and multiple sets are a plus. Furniture must fit like puzzle pieces.   Other spouses  have living rooms that are immaculate and seldom used.  Military spouses  have immaculate living room/dining room combos. The coffee table got a scratch or two moving from Germany, but it still looks pretty good.   Other spouses  say goodbye to their spouse for a business trip and know they won’t see them for a week. They are lonely, but can survive.  Military spouses  say goodbye to their deploying spouse and know they won’t see them for months, or for a remote, a year. They are lonely, but will survive.  Other spouses , when a washer hose blows off, call Maytag and then write a check out for getting the hose reconnected.  Military spouses  will cut the water off and fix it themselves.   Other spouses  get used to saying “hello” to friends they see all the time.  Military spouses  get used to saying “goodbye” to friends made the last two years.   Other spouses  worry about whether their child will be class president next year.  Military spouses  worry about whether their child will be accepted in yet another new school again next year, and whether that school will be the worst in the city...again.  Other spouses  can count on spouse participation in special events...birthdays, anniversaries, concerts, football games, graduation and even the birth of a child.  Military spouses  count on each other: duty comes first. It can be no other way.  Other spouses  put up yellow ribbons when the troops are imperiled across the globe and take them down when the troops come home.  Military spouses  wear yellow ribbons around their hearts and they never go away.  Other spouses  worry about being late for mom’s Thanksgiving dinner.  Military spouses  worry about getting back from Japan in time for dad’s funeral. And  other spouses  are touched by the television program showing an elderly lady putting a card down in front of a long, black wall that has names on it. The card simply says, “Happy Birthday, Sweetheart. You would have been sixty today.” A  military spouse  is the lady with the card. And the wall is the Vietnam Memorial.  I would never say military spouses are better or worse than other spouses are. But I will say there is a difference. And I will say that our country asks more of military spouses than is asked of other spouses. And I will say, without hesitation, that military spouses pay just as high a price for freedom as do their active duty husbands or wives. Perhaps the price they pay is even higher. Dying in service to our country isn’t near as hard as loving someone who has died in service to our country and having to live without them. Military spouses deserve America’s gratitude for all they freely give. And if you know one, let them know how much you appreciate their sacrifices.

      What I did this weekend is I went to a party at Svacia’s house. I played lots of games and we had a piñata and I got lots of candy. Then mom picked me up and we went home. I had some snacks, pumpkin bread. Then we went to the park. We drove all over the place looking for a lake and a park so we could feed the ducks. Then we got to a park with a lake. Then I threw up because I ate too much candy at Svacia’s party. Then we saw some baby geese. And my sister got one slide. Then we went home. I watched a little bit of TV. Then I went upstairs and played a little bit in my room. Then I watch Catherine play her game and Dad and Mom play too. Then Catherine whined and cried so dad put on his car game. He is like the Hulk when he plays it. I was doing a little gambling on the computer.  (Just to clear that up, she was playing Showbiz Slots at Pogo.com)  I made Tuna Helper. Mom told me what to do. Later I am going to get the Tuna Helper out of the oven. Then I am going to eat it. Then I am going to get my j’s on. Then I am going to play the car game. I am going to eat some Chunky Monkey for desert. Then I will go to bed. My sister will probably try and knock on my door, but I will ignore it and just fall asleep. Then tomorrow I will go to school. I don’t know what else I am going to do.

      I am still working on my Marilyn paper. I should be finished by today. It is kind of nice outside today. It is a little chilly, in the 40’s, but it is sunny and not too windy. It’s like winter to people who live in warmer places. Maybe later we will go to the lake and feed the ducks. Carolynn said she had fun at her sleep over. Her friends mom said she was really good, the best one. She was polite and quiet. I want to know what Carolynn that was. Carolynn said they watched a movie about Chucky, the doll who kills people. She said she liked it and it didn’t give her nightmares. It gives me nightmares. I hate movies like that.   I only have one more week of school. I am so glad. The next week is finals. I only have two finals and one is online. After finals, then the week after that is our vacation. Carolynn, Catherine, and I are getting really excited. We are gong to see lots of cool stuff. Carolynn is really looking forward to the river boat ride we will be taking. Catherine is really looking forward to sleeping at a hotel and swimming in the pool. I am really looking forward to the historical stuff. We are going to see the home of Andrew Jackson, and an old plantation that raised race horses. We are going to see Loretta Lynn’s Haunted Plantation. Nashville has an exact replica of the Parthenon. Plus we are going to do lots of country music stuff. It’s going to be a heck of a Hee Haw vacation.   Well, not much else is happening today. Phillip has to go to work tonight. I have school tomorrow morning. That is all for now.

      Today was the last biology class I ever have to go to. Well, sort of. I have to go back next Saturday to take the final. But then that is it. I am glad it is over. Phillip was making pancakes when I got home but we were out of syrup. The girls put grape jelly on their pancakes but Phillip was pretty sad and had leftovers instead. He doesn’t eat pancakes with anything but maple syrup. I have to finish the laundry and work on my Marilyn Monroe paper today. Carolynn is going to a sleep over tonight. Catherine is terrorizing everything. That is it for today.   It Figures……   42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.

      Well, first,  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TRISHA!!!!  Now that you have caught up with me, just remember, Cari is still older. Moreover, since it is Trisha’s birthday, here are some pictures just for her.   urlLink    Photo from http://www.webshots.com&nbsp; urlLink     Trisha’s Favorite Animal- The Giraffe    urlLink    Photo From http://www.jeep.com&nbsp; urlLink     Trisha once told me she always wanted one of these.   There is not much going on here today. I have a mythology class later. I have to turn in my assignment. He had us write poems about a Norse god or goddess. I wrote mine on Aegir, God of The Sea. I thought I would share it with you. I hope you enjoy it.  The Vikings had a god called Aegir Who made his home off the end of the pier. Living at the bottom of the sea He was wild and free And threw crazy parties with beer.  Carolynn got her scooter stolen from the park today. Well, it might have been taken by mistake since everyone has that scooter, but in this neighborhood… Phillip told her not to take it if she was not going to be riding it the whole time. But then she went over there and was playing hide-n-seek with her friend Razhane, leaving her scooter lying in the grass in the crowded park, and now it is no where to be found. Phillip and Catherine went to Phillip’s friend Dave’s house for the afternoon. I think they were going to be playing some video game and I think Phillip is bringing Dave’s little boy over here to watch him so Dave can go do something. Carolynn and I are making tuna casserole for dinner.     Car Week Continues….    Family Cars    urlLink    My Dad's&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Phillip's&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Carolynn- 2 Fast, 2 Furious&nbsp; urlLink     So in my continuation of car week, here is a picture of Carolynn at a car show we went to this past January. She is standing in front of the pink car from the movie  2 Fast 2 Furious . We didn’t do much today. I worked on homework, as usual. Carolynn built a new fort in the yard. Catherine was supposed to be cleaning her room, but really she is hanging out on the stairs. I went to the Piggly Wiggly for some milk. Phillip went to the gym. We had pancakes and sausage for dinner. We are the most exciting family in the state of Wisconsin!  Okay you Harry Potter fans, here is some news for you. Though there is still no word on when the sixth installment of the Harry Potter book series will be out, they have released the title just to tease us. It will be called  Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince . As you know, the fifth one,  Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix , was released over a year ago, sometime last June. In case you need it, it will finally be coming to paperback on August 2. Of course, I have them all in hardback. However, if she could hurry up with that sixth one, I would be so happy! P.S.

      Today is a nice day. Catherine and Carolynn built a fort in the yard. Phillip weeded the front yard and it looks so great. I am taking many pictures of it when it is looking its best so we can use them when we are selling the house sometime soon. Phillip’s orders are on the way. According to Phillip, he was told he would know the first week in July or so. Nevertheless, remember, it is the Navy, so I will believe it when it happens. All of the orders we have requested are in San Diego, but that does not necessarily mean it is guaranteed. We decided on San Diego, not only because it is closer to the family but for other reasons too. The weather there is so great. It is not too hot, not too cold, and not too humid. There are plenty of things to do in the area. There are good schools for me to go to and there are plenty of opportunities for me to find a job I will love. We considered Florida, but there are not a lot of opportunities for me there, there are big bugs and it is too humid. Phillip wants to move there for some reason that has to do with cars. But that is not reason to move somewhere, just for car parts. We considered Virginia, but the weather there is humid too. However, there would be many cool job opportunities there since it would be so close to Washington DC. However since I do not have a degree yet, there is no point in moving there. I can go to school anywhere and this way we can be closer to our family. So hopefully, San Diego here we come.  Well, today I got the results of the Greek Mythology test I took on Wednesday. I know you all have been on the edge of your seats in anticipation, so I will not delay any further. I got a 98 on the test. Then we had to write a movie plot based on the god or goddess of our choice. I chose Athena, Goddess of Wisdom and War. In addition, I got a perfect score on that. My teacher loved the part I put in about people who are stuck on potties at the Parthenon.( For those of you who have not been keeping up, the Parthenon is a temple to the goddess Athena in Athens, Greece. However, they have an exact replica of it in Nashville and when we went there on vacation recently, Catherine got stuck on a potty.  NOW PLEASE KEEP UP! I AM NOT GOING TO KEEP REPEATING MYSELF!  ) So now we have started on Norse (Viking) Mythology. It is not as interesting as Greek/Roman Mythology, but at least it is short.   Anyway, yesterday I posed the question, “ What is your favorite car of all time? ” In keeping with that, here is a picture of my mom’s dream car. It is basically the car she has now, a silver PT Cruiser, but the one in the picture has flames on it and my mom’s PT does not have flames yet. It will though. Anyway, my mom sent me this picture. I do not know where she got it. I think I will keep with my car question through Friday. Enjoy the picture.    urlLink    My Mom's Dream Car&nbsp; urlLink       And The Survey Says……   What is your favorite car of all time?    Some More Answers   My Mom-   PT Cruiser

      I finally finished that history paper I have been working on all week. I have been having trouble getting it done because the links the teacher gave me to the papers I needed to read were not working from either of our computers. Finally, Phillip called his friend Dave, who could see them with his computer and he copied them into an email and sent it to me. Therefore, if it were not for the two of them my history paper would have been a bust. It was due by tonight. I baked them some cookies and in their honor, I am putting this picture of a cool car on our family website. Phillip picked it out. I hope you like it.    urlLink    Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution (Picture taken from http://www.mitsubishimotors.com)&nbsp; urlLink       And Survey Says….   What is your favorite car of all time?

      Well, not much planned for today. Yesterday we watched the Olympic trials for Rhythmic Gymnastics and Trampoline. We watched  Meet Me In St. Louis  (It is a classic) and  The Haunted Mansion  (It was okay). The girls played outside a little. Phillip and I played some video game. I worked on some homework. Today I plan to do more homework and doing a little laundry (It never gets done!). Phillip has to go to work tonight. There is some Gymnastics we recorded yesterday and some more on tonight we might watch. Well, that is all for today. Sorry we lead such boring lives.   urlLink    Smithsonian Institution- Original Building (Picture from http://www.si.edu)&nbsp; urlLink      Today In History   On June 27, 1829, an English scientist named James Smithson, who had never been to America, passed away leaving a large sum of money to the United States of America. This money was specifically to be used for the establishment of the Smithsonian Institute. On June 27, 1846, an act of Congress formally established the Smithsonian Institute. The Smithsonian Institute is the largest museum complex in the world and it is located in Washington DC. It is comprised of 14 museums and a National Zoo. (It also has two museums in New York City.) Exhibits there include the Wright Brothers’ first successful flyer built in 1903, Charles Lindbergh’s "Spirit of St. Louis", never before seen pictures of The Beatles, and tons of other really cool stuff. Admission is free to everything in Washington DC.  If I lived near there I would be there everyday!!

      Well, once again, Phillip’s schedule is messing with me. First, he said he would have duty for the Fourth of July. Now he says he will be home. So maybe now Cari and her family can come up and we can barbecue and have fireworks. Maybe I should call Cari and tell her. I don’t think she reads this. Also, if Trish wants to drive that far, she should know she is always welcome at our house. However, Casey probably has to work, she probably does not want to drive that far by herself, and she probably has homework, so I will not be offended at all when she cannot come. Anyway, today is Family Day at our house. Yesterday we cleaned the house so that we would not have to worry about it today. We have a bunch of movies picked out to watch-  Summer Stock ,  The Haunted Mansion ,  Treasure Planet , and  Meet Me In St. Louis . We are also watching Olympic trials- Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampoline, and day one of gymnastics. We are having snacks and not getting dressed all day. We are just hanging out in our pajamas. Well, that is it for today.

      Well another day, more homework. I have a history paper due on Sunday and I have a sociology section I want to try to finish this weekend. Well, Phillip has duty next weekend so my Independence Day plans are pretty crappy. I was planning to get together with my friend Cari and her family, but now that Phillip has duty, I do not know what we will do. Phillip was looking forward to his last chance for fireworks, as they are not allowed when we move back to California. Anyway, my sister will be here the weekend after that and we are going to the Six Flags that week. Maybe Cari and her family want to come and go to Six Flags with us. I do not really have any other big plans for today. Phillip is having some issue with some neighbor woman. Priscilla, our dog, has decided over the last few days that it is a fun game to run away every time we open a door. Well, the other day when she did that Phillip went to catch her. Priscilla is not the friendliest dog and when Phillip grabbed her collar, she twisted and bit him and was howling and barking. Anyway, some neighbor woman came outside and told Phillip off because she says he was abusing Priscilla and if she seen him be cruel to the dog again she was going to report him. So yesterday, Priscilla took off and it took Phillip over 30 minutes to catch her because he was afraid if he grabbed her, that woman would have the police come.  Of course Priscilla always has to run over by that woman’s house because she has a few dogs herself who get all worked up when Priscilla goes over there. I can no wait to get out of this village of idiots. If that woman knew how Phillip really treats his Priscilla, she would keep her mouth shut. Phillip treats that dog better than some people treat other humans. Well, that is it. I have to get back to studying.    Thank You.

      ***Okay, so if you happen to be reading the news here and there is just a picture and no story, it means I am in the process of adding in the text. The pictures come first. All you have to do is come back a few minutes later and see the full story.***        The weather was crazy last night. There were thunderstorms, rain, and hail. There were even a few tornadoes in the area. I had to go to my class in that crazy weather. My Greek Mythology test was so easy! I cannot believe how easy it was. Now we are starting on Norse Mythology. I thought it was going to be the mythology of India, but that comes after the Norse myths.   Phillip is getting closer on those orders. He actually has it narrowed down to actual ships and stuff, but he is waiting on some people to get back to him. I promise I will let you all know when I know. It should be very soon. Phillip has been all obsessed with the Godfather movies this week. It is a nice change from his usual obsession with car shows. He watches Spike TV, the network for men, all the time and they have been running the Godfather series uncut. He also watches  The Joe Schmoe Show . Has anyone seen that show? Is that the dumbest show or what? I do not see how those people actually fall for that.   You know Thursdays just are not the same without  Friends . There just is not much on TV in the summer anyway. I spend a lot of time watching true crime;  Cold Case Files ,  American Justice , and  City Confidential  on A&E,  The Forensic Files  on Court TV,  The FBI Files , and  The Justice Files  on the Discovery Channel,  Infamous Murders , and  True Crime  on the History Channel, and  Law and Order: Crime and Punishment  on NBC. I also have been watching  Airline  on A&E. It is a show that shows the real workings and stuff at airports serviced by Southwest airlines. It is just shocking to see the insane things that people do at the airport. I also watch  Family Plots  on A&E. It is a real life show about a family who work at a mortuary in San Diego, California. It is okay. It is not the greatest show ever, but as I said, there is not anything else on. It is not as if I have a ton of time for TV anyway with school. However, I do not mind. The faster I finish school, the faster I can get a good job. Then I am going to take my mom on a cruise. I plan to go back to work at Hickory Farms in late September. I do not plan to sell Beef Stick forever though. As much as I like working for Hickory Farms (most of the time), I want a real career. That is why I have been going to school to get my degrees in Journalism and History. (I could not decide on one.) Well, the girls have been playing all day. They are looking forward to my sister visiting. I am too. I am going to leave her here with the kids and get away for a minute. We are also going to go to Six Flags Great America. Well, that is all for today.     51 Days Until The Opening Ceremonies Of The Olympics   urlLink    Picture from http://www.wheaties.com Copyright 2004 General Mills, Inc.

      Well, I have gotten a lot of cool response from my new website. It is very cool. I got an e-mail from Phillip’s Uncle Scott. I do not think I ever got an email from him before and I thought that was really great. He said he just bought a house in Running Springs, California. Congratulations Uncle Scott!!! It must be beautiful up there. I am not too fond of snow though. It makes Phillip really happy when we hear from his side of the family. We all really miss our family and friends.   Just to let you know, you do not have to have a Blogger account to post a comment on my page. You can just post it under anonymous and then sign your name to the bottom. Just remember it is a public website. Do not post anything you do not want everyone to read. In addition, it is one of my philosophies to remember if you do not have anything nice to say, do not say anything at all.  One last little note, NO Heather I do not know when or where we will be moving just yet, we do not have orders. Phillip has been working on it. We are going to, if at all possible, return to San Diego. In addition, it is looking like February when we will be moving. Sorry Heather! In case you do not know, my friend Heather was transferred to Virginia a few months ago and she was hoping we might move there as well. However, I think everyone here misses our family too much. On the other hand, maybe we just miss the weather!!  Anyway, nothing exciting is going on today. I have an exam on Greek Mythology today. I really am not anticipating it being to difficult as my instructor allows one full page of notes. He allows both sides with as much information as fit. In addition, he gave us the questions on Monday. Therefore, I, like most of my classmates, am typing out as much as possible, in the smallest font size with the smallest margins. I just do not see how it can be that difficult of a test with that kind of cheat sheet.   Well, that is all for today. We are having some weird weather. It is warm and sunny, but then clouds come and there is thunder, lightning and it starts raining. Then the clouds pass and it is sunny again. In addition, as today is the last day I will be studying Greek Mythology, I added this picture of Hercules. Okay, not the real Hercules of Greek Myths, but Hercules is the name of my moms Pomeranian. Next week we begin mythology of India.  urlLink    Hercules. Toughest dog in this picture!&nbsp; urlLink       One Last Greek Myth   Who is the Greek goddess of the rainbow?

       urlLink    The Parthenon Nashville, Tennessee&nbsp; urlLink     Well, I am finished with my website remodeling job. I hope everyone likes it. I added places for people to post their comments. In addition, I can add pictures! Since I am working hard studying for a Mythology test tomorrow and I am working on an essay about Athena,   AND   since Athens will be hosting the Olympics later this summer, I figured I would post this picture of The Parthenon. It isn’t the real one. The real one is in Athens and is a temple of the goddess Athena, who was the patron goddess of Athens. This picture my mom took of the exact replica they have in Nashville. This is also the place where Catherine was stuck on the potty while we were on vacation. She is a little sensitive about it, so if you see her do not mention it unless you want to be growled at.  Anyway, nothing else is really going on today. I am just studying. The girls are playing dress up. That is it for today.    Greek Myth   Who is the Greek god of war?   Answer   Ares    p.s.

      Well,  Happy Father’s Day  to all of the fathers out there. I know that my own father had a pretty good Mother’s Day as he went to a ball game and to the Hooters. I do not know if that you can top that for Father’s Day. I know that he is going to another ball game today. I think that the only thing that can top his Mother’s Day adventure is maybe girls with even bigger boobs to go with his ball game. I assume that he is having a good day though because he is at a Dodger’s game and the Dodger’s are winning 5 to 3 in the eighth inning. Catherine is watching to see if she sees them on TV. She is calling the Dodger pitcher, Gagne, Earwax Man because while we were watching we saw him cleaning his ears with a towel and then wiping the towel all over his face. Gross! She also says Hideki Matsui of the Yankees looks like Jackie Chan. Oh, and the Dodgers finally won that game! Woo Hoo!  Well, we did not do anything that exciting today. We barbecued some burgers. I worked on homework. I finished a history paper. Just in time to start another one. Well, that is all for now.

      Well, I am still doing homework. It seems like all I do. I got a bit behind while Phillip’s mom was here and I am still catching up. I got calluses on my fingers from my pencil. Phillip ran over to the Wal-Mart last night to get me some of those spongy things for your pencil to keep it from getting worse. The girls played outside all day yesterday and they are outside playing today. It is somewhat chilly today. It is only 60 degrees outside and it is after 1:00 in the afternoon. Phillip is going to take the girls hiking later so I can work on my homework in peace. Well, that is about it for now.

      Okay so I lied. I did not keep up. Oh well, it will give you more reason to sue me. Anyways, not much happened yesterday. I went to the commissary for groceries. I did homework until the wee hours of morning. Sociology seems really interesting. History is time consuming. In addition, mythology is cool, but also time consuming. I have to get the laundry done and the kids are bored. You would think that they would like to be on summer vacation. Well, that is all for today. All I have planned for the rest of today is homework and laundry. The excitement just keeps on coming.  Oh yeah, today is my sister’s birthday. Woo Hoo!   =================================  I am too lazy to think of anything interesting to write here, so just deal with it!

      Yeah, I know that I have not written in several days.  SUE ME!  I have had a busy week. Phillip’s mom left on Tuesday and she wanted to do a lot of stuff while she was here. Therefore, on Saturday we went out and saw the amazing sights of our town. We went downtown and went to the museum. It is free and it is not very big. Then we took a ride on the Kenosha Trolley. It costs a quarter and it just goes around in a little circle around a couple of blocks. Then we went and looked at the two lighthouses that are here in Kenosha. After that, we had a little snack at the Wendy’s, headed north to Racine, the next town in that direction, and went to the zoo. It is also free and small, but the kids like it. Then we went and saw the Wind Point lighthouse, which is also in Racine. Then we came home, barbecued some steaks and ribs, had a few wine coolers, and played some games. Wine coolers, by the way, make board games much funnier. Sunday, we went down to the base. Phillip’s mom bought some Navy souvenirs. Then we went to the Gurnee Mills mall. We walked all around. Then we went out to dinner at my favorite Mexican restaurant. Monday Phillip and his mom went to the movies. I just stayed here with the kids, they swam, and they got out the Slip and Slide. I barbecued chicken for dinner and then I went to my Mythology and Fairy Tales class. Tuesday we went down to Chicago. We took a tour of the city. We went to lunch at the Bubba Gump’s. After that, we took Phillip’s mom and his little brother to the airport. We stopped at Taco Bell on the way home. It was nice that Phillip’s mom came to visit but I am glad life is back to normal again. My sister is coming to visit next. She will be here July 10.   Today was pretty quiet. We went to the Wal-Mart. I worked on some homework and then went to my class. Anyway, now you are all caught up. I will try to keep up.

      Well, today we went to the Miller Brewery and took the tour. We got ourselves some free beer. Then we came home and ate brats for dinner. Phillip’s mom made some salsa and my mouth is in permanent flames, but I like it. It definitely clears the sinuses. It is still rainy here. I was hoping it would be warmer and sunnier, but what can you do? It is supposed to clear up for a little while tomorrow and then clear up again on Monday and Tuesday. We will see.

      Well, today we went to the Jelly Belly factory. They had a memorial set up for President Reagan and they gave a little talk about him besides their usual tour. We got some yummy jelly beans. It has been raining all day. I hope the weather clears up for Phillip’s mom. However, it is supposed to rain for several days. Well, that is all for now.

I made meatloaf for dinner. I have been doing homework. This mythology is pretty interesting. Well, that is all for today.    Cartoonish Question   What is the name of Popeye’s girlfriend?

      Well, I went to my Mythology and fairytales class today. It was pretty cool and it seems like it is going to be very interesting. I got my truck back today too. It is working fine. We got Carolynn her own cell phone today. Well, she has her own number, but she has to share her minutes with Phillip. That way she can call us if she gets home from school before we do since we have no phone in the house. In addition, it will be useful when she goes to the park and stuff. We will not have to hunt for her. She has a really cool strap for it so she can wear it like a necklace. It is very small. Anyway, her number is  262-909-1244 . Do not call her a lot unless you have Verizon because she does not have her own minutes. She does have unlimited nights (when she is in bed) and weekends and mobile to mobile. She thinks she is so cool. She will not be taking it to school or anything. It is mostly just for home use. It was cheaper to get her her own cell phone than to have the home phone hooked up. It would have been $85 to get SBC to connect us. Then it would have been $24.99 a month just for a basic line with no features. For only $20.00 more each month on our cell phone bill, she gets her own line, voice mail, and a cool cell phone, which was free for signing up. She said today must be her lucky day and that she was glad the regular phone company made me mad. Well, that is all. I have plenty of schoolwork to do.    Did You Know?

      Nothing exciting happened today. I am still not using SBC, so we are still using only cell phones. I wrote SBC a very nasty letter. We went and got Phillip a new cell phone. That is one of the benefits on Verizon. They give you a new phone every two years. His new phone flips open and has a leather case. It is a very nice day here in Kenosha. We have temperatures in the 80’s. Phillip’s mom will be here on Wednesday. I hope the weather is good then. School starts back up for me tomorrow. I only have to go to one class. It is on Monday and Wednesday nights. Phillip’s schedule changed again so I can go at night. He still works at night just later. Carolynn’s last day of the second grade is Wednesday. She goes back in September. We got a notice that Catherine starts school on September 7. I still do not have my truck back. They offered me a rental car but I was not going anywhere. They said I should have it back tomorrow afternoon. Thanks to my warranty, I am paying $25 for over $900 in repairs. All that has been on the news all weekend has been about the death of former president Ronald Reagan. In case you had not heard, he died Saturday at the age of 93. He had Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, just to get herself in the news when all news was about Ronald Reagan, Jennifer Lopez reportedly married singer Marc Anthony this weekend. She and Ben have only been broken up about six months and Marc Anthony has only been divorced from his last wife for about a week.  (That isn't always bad. I have friends who are married now, who got married only a week after the divorce of one of them.)  Anyways, if this is true about J. Lo., I bet they are divorced by Labor Day.

      Well, I no longer have a phone in my house. SBC, my phone company, shut it off on Tuesday or Wednesday because they said I did not pay my bill. I did pay my bill, but they said it was late. According to my bill, it was due on June 1. It was paid by June 1. However, they sent out some notice stating that if I did not pay it by the May 25 they would shut it off. I have no idea why. It is not as if it was months worth of bills. I did not get this notice because I was on vacation. I paid the bill by June 1 like I thought I should. When I went to their website, it even said that payment was due on June 1 and that I had paid in full. However, when I called they said because I did not pay it by May 25, on June 2 they shut off my phone. They shut off my phone after I had already paid the bill. When I called them, they said they would turn my phone back on if I paid them $85.00. I pay my bill on time and in full, and they shut it off and expect me to pay them another $85 to turn it back on. I think not. Therefore, we are just using our cell phones now. I have never once had any problems with Verizon, my cell phone company. They are always polite if I call. SBC was not. If I ever have any phone trouble, Verizon always takes care of it right away. I called SBC a bunch of times this week before I got an answer. The customer service I got from SBC was horrid. They hung up on me.  Therefore, I will never use their services ever again. These services include Yahoo DSL and Cingular Wireless as well as their phone service. If that is how they treat their paying customers, I would hate to see how they treat customers who miss a payment. For those who need it, here are our cell phone numbers:  Phillip-  (262) 909-9032  Jenny-  (262) 909-9030  Anyways, I did not write yesterday because I forgot. Carolynn was very upset with me yesterday. Her class was singing in an assembly, she was going to read a poem all by herself at this assembly, and she wanted me to come. Therefore, I called the school to ask what time and they told me it had been moved to Monday at 1:00. Therefore, I was going to go then. However, when Carolynn got home she was crying because the assembly was yesterday and she thought I forgot about her after I promised. I did not forget. The secretary at her school should get her facts straight. She was pretty upset.  Today we went and saw  Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban . The movie was good but it did not really go along with the book that well. There were things that were not explained well and parts they left out. I still like the books better than the movies but the movie was still good. Anyways, that is all for today. Remember, we only use cell phones now. Do not bother calling the house. SBC is the one losing out.    Across The Pond   What is a truck called in Britain?    Answer   Lorry

      Well, my truck is still in the shop. I may not get it back until Monday. I hope so because I go back to school on Monday. I went to exchange my Women in Literature books for my Mythology and Fairytales books this afternoon. Carolynn got her braces on yesterday. They are pink and purple. She was worried people would make fun at school but no one did. She said she s the only one in her school with braces. Catherine got into the four-year-old kindergarten class for next year. There is Not too much else going on. Oh yeah, our home phone is not working. I have no idea why, but it has not worked in three days. The phone company is giving me a bunch of crap. I paid them on time and in full as usual. They say they are sending someone out tomorrow to fix it. I will believe that when I see it. So if anyone needs to call me, call my cell phone or email me. The cable company and Verizon are not giving me any trouble.

That will give me something to watch in July. It starts July 12. Well, the Women In Literature class I chose to replace the canceled pop culture humanities class I first chose was also canceled. It sucks because I already bought the books for the literature class. So now I have to return the literature books and get the books for the class I have chosen to replace that. I chose a class called Mythology and Fairytales. I hope that that one is not cancelled.  We had lamb chops for dinner. Carolynn just loved them. No one else cared for them. They still have not fixed my truck. I should have it back by the end of the week. We are going to see  Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban  this weekend. I hope it is good. The first two were pretty good. I still prefer the books. The third book is my favorite so they had better get this movie right or I will be mad. Well, that is all for today.

      Today I ran a few errands. I dropped my truck off to have the brakes repaired and the center seatbelt in the back repaired as well. It got stuck while we were on vacation. I went and got my books for school. The humanities class I was going to take was canceled so I a taking a class called Women In Literature instead. We went to Taco Bell to get some lunch. Phillip and I beat  Warioworld , a video game on our Gamecube. There is not anything good on TV to talk about. There probably will not be until September. Doesn’t that suck? My garden is coming along well. I have tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, peas, green beans, carrots, lettuce, raspberries, and grapes growing. I wish the weather would get better. It is always raining and cloudy. Today’s high was only 70 and that is the highest it has been in a while. And it is June! I cannot wait to get the heck out of here. Phillip said he was going to check about his orders today. He has been having a hard time getting hold of the right person to do the paperwork. So we should know soon. That is all for today. Phillip’s mom will be here one week from tomorrow. Carolynn’s last day of school is one week from tomorrow. Tomorrow Carolynn gets her braces on and I have to take Catherine at 12:45 for her kindergarten appointment. It will be a busy day.   Memorial Day Remembrance   When was President Dwight D.

      So schools out!! I only got two A’s- Sociology and Mythology and Fairytales. I got a B in History. Oh well, two out of three. Anyway, now that school is over I feel much better. Anyway, today I did a lot of stuff. I got up early and then went to got donuts for my family, who were very happy when they got up. Then this after noon all of us and Phillip’s friend Dave and his son Michael went to see  Spiderman 2 . It was good. After the movie, we walked around the mall and Carolynn did a little shopping in the Hello Kitty Store. I did a little shopping at the Bath and Body Works. Phillip did a little shopping at the video game store. We stopped at the McDonald’s on the way home and got some Happy Meals. I am collecting the Beanie Bears. I got Golden Arches the Bear, Mcnuggets the Bear, and Ronald McDonald the bear. I only have nine more to go.

I have to get the house cleaned up and I have to get the laundry done. I wish there were three of me. Oh well, just a few more days and it will be over. That is all for today.

      Well, I got my first A is sociology. I was so excited. That brings my grade up to an 88 in that class. I have two more assignments in that class. If I cannot get my grade up to an A with those two, then I will do the extra credit assignment. I only have two more mythology classes to go to. I already have an A in that class. All I have left in my history class is the final. Then the semester will be over. Then I can get on to cleaning out the house and finding a real estate agent. I have to prepare for our move and I do not want to wait until last minute. There are only a couple of weeks between Summer school and the start of the fall semester. In addition, I am starting back at work soon. I really like my job. I especially like that it only lasts a few months a year. Well, here is a picture of my cousins at Seaworld. I wish I were there. Soon I will be. I love the zoo. We usually get yearly passes for the zoo. I like Seaworld too. We never went to Legoland before. We will have to give that a try.

      I finished the last two assignments for my history class. Now al that I have left in that class is the final. Now I am trying to finish my sociology class. So this is how my life goes. The girls have been playing all day. Phillip has been playing his video game. I am still feeling sick. I am a little better but still sick. I did not get around to cleaning out Catherine’s room today. I want to get this homework done. That is all for today.

      I took my mom’s advice last night, took some Nyquil, and went to sleep. I still feel sick today. Today I did homework. My goal is to finish my history class today and try to finish my sociology class. We cleaned out Carolynn’s room today. This had two purposes. The first is to get rid of stuff that I do not want to move. The movers are scheduled to be here on January 27. The other was to see what kind of stuff she needed for school. My mom wanted to know so I am writing it here. Carolynn needs jeans. She wears size 7 or 8. She will not wear sweatpants to school. She does not think they are cool enough. She needs some long sleeve shirts. She wears a size 8 or 10 for that. She has a ton of t-shirts. She needs panties- size 8 or 10 for panties. She needs shoes, size 2. She needs a lightweight jacket or a zip-up sweatshirt- probably size 8 or 10 for that. In addition, she needs pajamas, size 8 or 10. Tomorrow we will be tackling Catherine’s room. We had pizza for dinner. This house really needs to be cleaned out before the movers come and I have to work almost right up until we move. I am so excited about moving. I cannot wait. As much trouble as moving is, I still cannot wait.    urlLink     Carolynn in the yard.&nbsp; urlLink          Phillip’s New Ship      USS GERMANTOWN is named after the historical Pennsylvania district of Germantown. Now a residential section of Philadelphia, Germantown was founded in 1683. It was the site of an important battle of the American War for Independence fought Oct. 4, 1777, between the forces of General George Washington and General William Howe. On the morning of the battle, amidst dense fog, Washington's forces engaged 9,000 of Howe's troops. The Colonists, however, were forced to retreat when the British ranks reformed and were reinforced. Although technically a defeat, this battle demonstrated the colonists' tenacity and courage in battle against the better trained British troops and helped gain French support for the final battle at Yorktown, Virginia.(From www.germantown.navy.mil)

      The American Idol concert was good. It was not as good as Kelly and Clay, but a little better than last seasons American Idol tour. We went last year too. The concert started with the Milwaukee Idol singing Clay Aiken’s Invisible. He sucked. We saw Clay sing that at his concert in March and at last year’s American Idol concert. Clay is good. Then everyone came on and sang a song each. There were ten of them. Matt Rodgers and Leah Labelle were not with the tour. After they all sang a song (Fantasia sang three and Diana sang two), there was a short intermission and then Tamyra Gray, from season one of American Idol came on and sang a few songs. She was really good. Then the Idols came back and sang a bunch of songs for about an hour and a half. Then Fantasia sang a few alone and then one more all together and that was it. It was good. Carolynn got herself some souvenirs. We had seats so close we were sitting on folding chairs. They were very uncomfortable so when it was intermission we moved to the first row of real seats. It was much more comfortable. There were not a whole lot of people there. Not even half of the Bradley Center was filled. That is where the Milwaukee Bucks and Marquette University basketball usually play. Anyway, the concert was good. Here are some pictures of Carolynn with her souvenirs.    urlLink    Carolynn with her American Idol T-Shirt and her Diana Degarmo button.&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Carolynn's American Idol Live Program&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Carolynn generously got this coffee cup for her daddy at the American Idol concert.&nbsp; urlLink     Well today, I am sick.

Then we will be going to the concert. I am sure that will be exciting. Carolynn can’t wait to see Fantasia Barrino and Diana Degarmo in person.

      Today I have my Indian mythology test. This will be the only one I think could be trouble. This stuff is very confusing. At least then, it will be over. All that is left is fairytales which we start today after the test. We are starting with Cinderella. Carolynn had fun sleeping over at Rebecca’s house last night. It has been raining all day. The girls have been playing out there all day. They are all wet and muddy. Phillip has been playing his game again all day. It is very exciting here.

      I know I forgot to write yesterday. I was busy with homework. There is only a week and two days left of the summer semester. Phillip has been playing his Final Fantasy 11. Catherine has been playing with her ponies. Carolynn is across the street at her friend Rebecca’s birthday. I do not know what that is all about. I got no invitation or anything and no one said anything until about two hours ago. They have their house for sale. I am going to go talk to real estate agents after school is out so we can sell our house. We are leaving here on February 1. I have already applied for housing in San Diego. I cannot wait to get out of here. I go to work soon. I have already been in contact with my new boss in Minnesota. I got all the girls school supplies. I just have to get them some school clothes. Mostly only Carolynn needs new clothes for school. Catherine has a ton of clothes. Catherine is already planning her birthday. Carolynn and I are going to see American Idol Live on Thursday. She is so excited.   Do not eat Banquet Home-style Bakes Cheesy Ham &amp; Hash browns.   It was so gross. It smelled like dog food and tasted like crap. I could not even choke down one bite. The house still smells like that crap. I had a jar of Ragu and a package of spaghetti so we did not starve. However, it was so gross. I sent the company a nasty e-mail.

       urlLink      Chicago, Illinois (Picture from www.webshots.com) &nbsp; urlLink      Well today my sister went home. I dropped her off at the airport in Chicago without any trouble. Too bad her flight was delayed. This morning Carolynn and Sarah went to see A Cinderella Story with Hilary Duff. They liked it. We barbecued chicken for dinner. Phillip’s friend Dave came over and they did some video game stuff. That is it. It was an exciting week.       One Last Boobie Issue      Two nuns are ordered to paint a room in the convent, and the last instruction of the Mother Superior is that they must not get even a drop of paint on their habits. After conferring about this for a while, the two nuns decide to lock the door of the room, strip off their habits, and paint in the nude. In the middle of the project, there comes a knock at the door.  "Who is it?", calls one of the nuns. "Blind man," replies a voice from the other side of the door. The two nuns look at each other and shrug, and deciding that no harm can come from letting a blind man into the room, they open the door.  "Nice boobs," says the man, "where do you want the blinds?"

      Today was a day for me- no walking around amusement parks, no shopping, or errand running. I got up late. I went and got a pedicure and got my nails done. I went out to dinner with Phillip, just Phillip, at the Red Lobster. We went and played mini golf and drove go-karts and played video games- no kids. It was wonderful. The kids and Sarah stayed home and ate frozen dinners. Sarah is freaking out because she got gum on a blanket and she thought Phillip was mad at her about it. She scrubbed the gum out with Shout and her toothbrush and then washed it. She said he scared her because he was mad. He was not even mad. She is a freaking nut. She has issues. Well, not much else is going on today. Here are some pictures of us mini golfing and a picture of Phillip sitting on Sarah. Tomorrow night my sister goes home. She and Carolynn are going to the movies in the morning. Phillip’s friend Dave is coming over and we are barbecuing chicken.

      Well we went to the Six Flags Great America. It was fun. The girls had a blast. Carolynn and Catherine rode a ton of rides. Sarah and Phillip rode roller coasters. They waited in line for and hour and a half to ride on Superman the Ride. I got a little sunburn. The girls got soaked on a couple of rides. Sarah had her own booby issue when her bra broke on a ride. In addition, we get to go again tomorrow free! Only Carolynn, Sarah, and I are going tomorrow. Phillip and Catherine are staying here.

      Well not much happened to us today. Phillip got his video game today. Then he had to take it back because it came out of the box already scratched up. Therefore, he was mad. Nevertheless, he finally got it working and got to play a little before work. I took Carolynn to the orthodontist. Her braces are now orange and green. They were pink and purple before. Here is a picture of them close up.    urlLink    Carolynn's Braces&nbsp; urlLink    I went to my mythology class. It was boring. Indian Mythology is so confusing.

Anyway, I got this entertaining thing from my Mythology professor today and I thought I would share it with you. I edited it because some of it was a little too refined. There were 100 of these.

      Well, today we did a little shopping. First we went to the Victoria’s Secret so I could buy a bra. You know you wanted to know that. Then we walked around the mall a little. It is not a big mall so it didn’t take long. My sister was really missing my mom or rather her credit cards. She has been looking for some G-Unit shoes forever and we found some today. They were pink high tops and everything. She was very sad. Then we went to the Applebee’s for some lunch. We went to the Sam’s Club for some groceries. We brought the groceries home and picked up Phillip. Then we went to the NEX and the commisary. We barbecued for dinner. We had steak and hot dogs for those who don’t eat steak and corn on the cob. Here are some pictures of Phillip barbecuing our dinner. I am having lots of fun with my new digital camera.   urlLink    Phillip cooking our dinner.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Our Dinner&nbsp; urlLink      More Military Humor   On some air bases the military uses one side of the field and civilian aircraft use the other side of the field, with the control tower in the middle.  One day one of these towers received a call from an aircraft asking, "What time is it?"  The tower responded, "Who is calling?" The aircraft replied, "What difference does it make?" The tower replied, "It makes a lot of difference . .  If it is an American Airlines flight, it is 3 o'clock.  If it is an Air Force plane, it is 1500 hours.  If it is a Navy aircraft, it is 6 bells.  If it is an Army aircraft, the big hand is on the 12 and the little hand is on the 3.  If it is a Marine Corps aircraft, it's Thursday afternoon and 120 minutes to "Happy Hour."

      Well, we made it home from the Hilton. We are all pretty tired. Carolynn fell asleep earlier then Sarah fell asleep. Phillip and I went to the store and I got a new digital camera that I love. Now I can put really cool pictures on here. Like this one of my sister when she was asleep earlier.    urlLink    Sarah After A Day At The Water Park&nbsp; urlLink    Well, we are all too tired out from our day at the water park so we are not doing anything special today. I dropped of the film I took at the water park to be developed at the Wal-Mart. You know if I had had any brains I would have got the digital camera before we went there, but what can you do? We went to the park. We had lasagna for dinner. I am playing hooky from school today. I am just too worn out to go to class. Well, we did not do anything funny today. Well, we had breakfast at the hotel this morning before we came home. You would think that being a big fancy hotel they would have good breakfasts but no, it was not that great. It was a buffet. The omelets were good and they had good fruit and cereal, but everything else was somewhat nasty. I guess that could be considered something funny that happened. On the other hand, it was not that funny.    Military Humor    Having just moved into his new office, a pompous, new colonel was sitting at his desk when an airman knocked on the door. Conscious of his new position, the colonel quickly picked up the phone, told the airman to enter, and then said into the phone, "Yes, General, I'll be seeing him this afternoon and I'll pass along your message. In the meantime, thank you for your good wishes, sir."  Feeling as though he had sufficiently impressed the young enlisted man, he asked, "What do you want?"  "Nothing important, sir," the airman replied, "I'm just here to hook-up your telephone."

       urlLink    Milwaukee Skyline (Picture from www.hiltonmilwaukee.com)&nbsp; urlLink    Well, here we are on the seventh floor of the Milwaukee Hilton City Walk. It is the fanciest hotel we have ever been in. They have ballrooms, chandeliers, and all that refined stuff. This hotel may be too good for us. They even have an indoor water park. It's a good thing too because it is pouring rain outside. The water park was cool. They have three big slides and three little ones. Catherine could go on one big one and all the little one. Everyone else could do them all. They had a huge Jacuzzi. There was even an arcade in there. We spent most of the day there. We got some snacks in the snack bar down there at the water park. Then we came back to the room and ordered a pizza. After dinner, we went down stairs to the water park again and stayed until closing. Sarah, Phillip, and I were having a contest on who can make the biggest splash off the water slide. Then my bathing suit top broke. It was wet and stuck in place so no one has to see what I keep underneath. Plus I am not exactly a sting bikini kind of girl. I like my bathings suits to cover all. Sarah fixed it so I could go up stairs and change. Luckily, I brought a spare bathing suit. However, Sarah and I were laughing so hard we were afraid our sides would split like my swimsuit. Well, my mom told us to do something funny everyday. Almost giving a water park full of people a booby show definitely qualifies. What makes me mad is just go that swimsuit and it broke. Sarah ate her first White Castle burger today. We stopped for gas on the way here and it was right next the White Castle. Therefore, we drove thru and got her a cheeseburger. It cost $0.62. It took forever in the drive thru and when we finally got the one burger, we ordered they gave us a free soda for waiting. We got a heck of a deal. Nobody in our family likes White Castle burgers. Sarah liked them. Ewww! Tomorrow we will be enjoying the hotel’s breakfast buffet. Carolynn says it is just like the time we went to Vegas and stayed at the Circus Circus. They had fun stuff for kids and a breakfast buffet too. Of course, Circus Circus was a little less refined than the Hilton we are staying at now. After breakfast, we will be heading home. I have a class tomorrow night and Phillip has to go to work tomorrow night. We are going to Six Flags on Thursday. That is all for tonight.

      Well I managed to pick up my sister at the airport with out incident. We took her out to dinner at the Ruby Tuesday. It was delicious. My sister got here and emptied her half of her suitcase into the girl’s rooms. She brought a whole bag full of groceries too. She brought Phillip Del Taco Burritos. Phillip loved that. Today we are going to the Milwaukee Hilton. They have a water park there. It should be fun. Well, I got some new pictures. I figured since you saw all my aunt’s pets on Friday I would post a picture of her. In this picture, she is seven but she is a little older than that now. I hope you enjoy. I will try to write later today and let you know how our day at the water park went.

      Pet week is over. It was fun though. Well it was fun for me at least. We will have to do it again sometime. Well, today my sister will be arriving. She was supposed to get in at 3:15 but she called a little while ago and said it is now 4:15. The girls are excited. Catherine was apparently so excited she forgot what she was doing this morning and was trying to put her shorts on over her head. Phillip and Carolynn went to the card shop to look at Yugi-Oh cards and Garbage Pail Kids. Catherine and I have been doing some gardening. We watered all the plants, took all the houseplants out for a little sun, and sprayed them off. We met our new neighbors. They just moved in to the house next to ours. There are three guys in their early twenties living there. I gave them a potted marigold for their porch. I had an over abundance of them. I potted a couple of spider plant babies in pots. I gave one to the lady across the street. I have a lot of those too. I have been doing the laundry and cleaning up a bit. Later after I go pick up Sarah we are going to dinner at Ruby Tuesday’s. They do not have those in California and we thought she might like it. Well, that is it for now.    urlLink    This picture of my sister Sarah was taken around July 2000. I already had it on disc and didn't feel like scanning a newer one so sue me.&nbsp; urlLink      This Made Phillip Snort Pepsi Out Of His Nose.    An elderly woman walked into the Bank of Canada one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, "$165,000.” The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.   The president was surprised and asked, "What kind of bets?"   The elderly woman replied, "Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square."   The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, "Would you like to take my bet?"   "Certainly,” replied the president. "I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square."   "Done,” the elderly woman answered. "But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness."   "No problem,” said the president of the Bank confidently.   That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square. The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. "Of course,” said the president. "Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure."   The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, "Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Bank of Canada!"

It tickles. Okay it was a lame story but it is my website so there. In addition, here is a picture of my friends Trisha’s bunny. Her name is Chloe, she is 17 months old, and she is an English Lop. I had a cool picture of my aunt and uncle’s dogs. They were cute, but I could not use it because they sent it inserted in an email instead of as an attachment. I tried to email them and let them know but my uncle told me sometimes they have trouble getting my emails. If they send it to me later, I will post it for you. Thanks to those of you who participated in Pet Week. I think it made it a little more interesting than just my boring life.  Well, nothing exciting going on today. I am finishing my history midterm. I have completed two of the three questions on it. I no longer need to worry about buying the whipped cream because yesterday when I was asleep, Phillip and the girls ate the strawberries. I still have not gotten over to the Wal-Mart to get my pictures. Phillip weeded the backyard. It looks good. Catherine actually cleaned her room for once. I got my Friends Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD in the mail yesterday so I have been watching that. Tomorrow my sister will be here. I have to go pick her up at the airport tomorrow afternoon. She will be here until the 18th.     Did You Know?   The name of the dog on the Cracker Jack box is Bingo. (Taken from www.akc.org)

      First, the moment you all have been waiting for,  Phillip has been selected for orders to the USS Germantown (LSD 42) home ported in San Diego, California.  Okay, so we do not know exactly when yet (probably February), but at least we know where. I knew you would want to know that first. Here is a picture of the USS Germantown and I have added a link to their ship website to my links to the right of this.  I am so excited! I get to get out of this place!    urlLink    USS Germantown (LSD 42) Picture from www.navy.mil&nbsp; urlLink    Well, I took a mythology test last night about Norse (Viking) Mythology. Once again, we could bring a cheat sheet, so once again it was easy. Now we have started on the mythology of India. I still have to finish my midterm for history by Friday. I still have not got to the store to pick up my pictures or get the whipped cream. I had better do that soon before the strawberries get yucky. Well, I have nothing planned for today except the inevitable studying and midterms. My friend Trish is doing her finals this week. She took some classes in the mid-spring quarter that are ending this week. That is it for today. Tomorrow is the last day for pet week so get your pictures and things to me soon. In addition, as we continue here on pet week, here are some pictures of dream pets.   urlLink    My sister said she always wanted one of these Jack Russell Terriers.   urlLink    My sister also said he always wanted a pug.   urlLink    And for some reason Sarah says she wants a monkey.   urlLink    I want to get one of these, a dachshund.

Contrary to popular belief, after the first year of life, a dog is equivalent to 16 human years.

      First, I would like to say  Happy Anniversary  to my parents who were married July 7, 2000 and to my grandparents (my mom’s parents) who were married on July 7, 1950. Here are some pictures of them.    urlLink    This is my grandpa and grandma, Gerald and Barbara Zibell, on their wedding day July 7, 1950. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    These are my parents, Arlene and Michael DeBar at the time of their wedding, July 7, 2000. &nbsp; urlLink    We got up early to get to the Krispy Kreame while the doughnuts were still hot. They were yummy. Phillip fixed it so he can go with us to the water park on Sunday. It sounds like fun. I did not get out anywhere yesterday. When I looked at the receipt for the pictures I was going to pick up, I realized they would not be ready until today. Therefore, I did not go. I just stayed home and worked on my homework. I have midterms this week so I am studying hard and it is taking up all of my time. That was why I came up with Pet Week. That way we would still have our website, but you would have to do the work.   Keep sending those pictures of your pets, pets you wish you had, pets you have had, or amusing pet stories.  Also, if you send pictures please send them as attachments so I can use them on our page.  In keeping with that spirit, here are some pictures of my friends’ pets.   urlLink    This is Heather's cat Allie. We were watching her one time and I though I lost her but she is so skinny that she fit in the two-inch gap under Phillip's dresser. Tiger found her and we lured her out with some cat food.  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    This is Heather's former dog Sulley. He was huge. However, because she lived in an apartment she had to give him up. It was sad. &nbsp; urlLink      And Yet No One Saved Leonardo DiCaprio…   Two dogs survived the sinking of the Titanic...a Pomeranian belonging to Miss Margaret Hays (in lifeboat 7) and a Pekingese belonging to Henry Sleeper Harper (in lifeboat 3).

      I thought I would start you out with a few pictures of our pets.    urlLink    Elvis Rebel Keating Dennen&nbsp; urlLink    This is Elvis. He will be three years old on July 15. He is a purebred beagle. We got him as a puppy from one of my mom’s friends. He is a good dog, somewhat dopey though and he seems rather attached to Catherine most of the time.    urlLink    Priscilla Dennen (However, on her papers it has her name as Matilda Roderigez Gonzales.)&nbsp; urlLink    This is Priscilla. She will be seven years old on July 30. She is also a purebred beagle. We have had her just about two and a half years. We rescued her from some people who were mean to her. They kept her locked in a kitty carrier. When we got her, she was so skinny you could see her ribs and her nails were so long she could hardly walk. She is a mean dog. She bites and does not like anyone except Phillip. Phillip loves her.   urlLink    Tiger and his Master Carolynn&nbsp; urlLink    This is Tiger (and Carolynn). He will be four years old on December 1. We rescued him from the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee in January 2003. He is the fattest cat I have ever seen. He thinks he is a dog sometimes. He is not shy at all. He is very friendly. He is best friends with Elvis and really seems to like Carolynn. He sleeps with her a lot and sits on her a lot and he tolerates most of her abuse.    Don't forget to send me your pictures of pets you have, wish to have, or have had. If you don't have any pictures just send an email with an amuzing story about your pets. Pet Week will run through Friday.     Well, once again homework is taking up all of my time. I got another full section of Sociology done. I did a little better on this test than on the last one. Last time I got a B, this time a B+. There are so many names and terms to remember and they can get confusing. There are five sections total, plus a bonus section for extra credit. Of course, I am going to do the bonus section. I am still behind on history, but I am catching up. Today I do not have a lot planned. I have to go to the grocery store to get some whipped cream. I bought some strawberries, but I forgot the whipped cream.  What was I thinking?  I have to go to the Wal-Mart to get a padded envelope to send back some of Phillips little brother Sean’s stuff. He left it when he was here a few weeks ago. I also have to pick up the pictures I took while they were here. Today is my friend Trisha’s daughter Morgan’s birthday. She is eight years old today.  Happy Birthday Morgan!!!  I did not send a present because it is against the rules. Trish says her kids have enough stuff. I do not want her wrath to come down on me. Anyway, not much else is going on here, just studying. It is my life.    House Rules  ( from www.akc.org )   1. The dog is not allowed in the house.  2. Okay, the dog is allowed in the house, but only in certain rooms.  3. The dog is allowed in all rooms, but has to stay off the furniture.  4. The dog can get on the old furniture only.  5. Fine, the dog is allowed on all the furniture, but is not allowed to sleep with the humans on the bed.  6. Okay, the dog is allowed on the bed, but only by invitation.  7. The dog can sleep on the bed whenever he wants, but not under the covers.  8. The dog can sleep under the covers by invitation only.  9. The dog can sleep under the covers every night.  10. Humans must ask permission to sleep under the covers with the dog.

      So anyway, today has not been that exciting. I made spaghetti for dinner. I made a few slight improvements on the website here, in case you did not notice. Phillip has duty all day. I have been trying to keep up with my homework. Sociology and Mythology are not too hard to keep up with, but history is just exhausting. My instructor has us doing a paper every week. In addition, there are two chapters to read, 32 questions to answer per chapter, two topics to discuss on paper, and two discussion boards to answer each week. Therefore, when you add all that to the other two classes it is very tiring. I do like school, but sometimes it just takes over. The girls have been watching a bunch of movies and stuff today. Carolynn watched Top Gun. We had some fireworks last night. I heard other people’s fireworks until very late into the night. I got all bit up by mosquitoes while sitting out in the back yard. I had  Off  all over myself; we had two citronella torches, one  Off  candle, and one  Off  incense. Nevertheless, I still managed to be bit up. Tomorrow starts Pet Week here on the family website. It would be a lot better if everyone participated. It only takes a few minutes to send an email.   urlLink    Washington D.C. as seen from Arlington, Virginia (Picture from www.webshots.com)&nbsp; urlLink     Well, I have been receiving a few emails filled of political innuendo floating my way from various sources. Just so you know, I do not base my vote on anything but actual, verifiable facts. I take it very seriously. Anyway, I want to say that I think it is extremely important that people vote. I do not want to influence whom you vote for, but it is necessary that you do it. I also want you to make an informed choice. I am begging you not to choose whom you vote for based on those stupid TV ads or biased news shows, articles or emails. There are ways for you to research your candidate, without relying on biased reports. Yes, it takes up more time, but it will be worth it to make an informed political choice. If you have access to internet, which I am sure you do if you are reading this, you can look up information on candidates. I have added a link to a website called  Project Vote Smart  to the right on this page. It will help you make an informed decision. It probably wouldn’t hurt some people to brush up on the way our government works. Until the last election, a large portion of the population did not even know that we used the Electoral College to elect our president. If you are over the age of 18, and not registered to vote,  do it now.  You need to register, in some places as much as thirty days, before an election. Sorry I had to get political on you, but this is very important.  Remember, this is our country, if we do not involve ourselves in it, then we have no right to complain about it.

      Last night I dyed my hair. I never did that before. I have colored it with the kind of color that washes right out again- pink and purple. However, this time it is real. I dyed it red. Yes I am aware that is was red to begin with, but I had a little hair issue, ( I do not want to talk about it ) and the dye was necessary. It was difficult waiting all that time for the dye to set. I had to itch my head like crazy. It is amazing how the second you cannot do something you need to. Also it was hard because I couldn’t wear my glasses and I can’t see a thing with out them. Therefore, I could not even watch TV, play Pogo games, or play the new Gameboy game I got. In addition, with a head covered in dye ( that indecently looked like blood and scared the hell out of my children and made my shower look like scene out of Psycho ), I could not answer the phone or sit back in a chair. Anyway, after all that trouble, it came out good. I now have  very  red hair.  Phillip had duty last night. He got home around 11 am. Later, if the weather is on our side, we are going to barbecue brats and then we have a few fireworks to set off. We cannot stay up too late because Phillip is still on duty and has to go back at 4 am tomorrow morning. My sister will be arriving on Saturday. She will be here for a week. That week is shaping up pretty good so far. On Sunday, we are spending the night at the Milwaukee Hilton. They have an indoor water park. On Thursday, we are going to Six Flags Great America. It will be fun.  Well, I hope everyone is having a good holiday. My parents and my grandpa are going to see the Angels play the Dodgers today. Catherine loves baseball. When we move back, maybe she can go too. Well have a great rest of the weekend. I hope you all have tomorrow off too.  Do not forget , Pet Week starts on Tuesday! Send me pictures of your pets, pets you wish you had, or funny stories about your pets. I have a few already,   but we need more  !   God Bless America    urlLink    Celebrating Lady Liberty, New York City (Picture from www.webshots.com)&nbsp; urlLink      Independence Day, a national holiday of the United States of America, commemorates the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1774, the 13 colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia to form the First Continental Congress. These men were unhappy with the rule of King George III of England, but did not want to go to war. The following May the colonies again sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress. For almost a year, the congress tried to work out its differences with England, once again without resulting to war. However, By June 1776, their efforts had become hopeless and a committee, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Philip Livingston, and Roger Sherman, decided to draft a formal declaration of independence. The men chose Thomas Jefferson to write it. It was presented to the congress on June 28 of that year. After various changes a vote was taken late in the afternoon on July 4, 1776. To make it official John Hancock, signed the Declaration of Independence. It was believed that he signed his name "with a great flourish" so "King George can read that without spectacles!” Thus, America declared its independence from England and began the great county we love today. Although the signing of the Declaration was not finished until August 1776, July 4 is accepted as the official anniversary of United States independence. The first Independence Day celebration took place the following year - July 4 1777.

      Well, I did not plan it that way that is just how it worked out. Yesterday I got  The Simpson’s - Season 4 on DVD. About a week or so ago Phillip ordered a bunch of movies from Columbia House. You know, you get like a bunch for like a penny or something. Anyway, he sent it out on Monday and the DVDs already got here yesterday. We got  Dirty Dancing ,  The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen ,  Top Gun ,  Blade ,  Ocean’s 11  (The new one),  Scarface , and  Cradle 2 Grave . Okay, as I said Phillip ordered them. I ordered  Friends -Seasons 1 and 2 from Amazon.com. They aren’t here yet, but I am looking forward to getting them. Anyway, in Catherine’s never ending quest for My Little Ponies, we are currently on the hunt for a pony called Tink-A-Tink-A-Too. I have tried all the usual places around here- Wal-Mart, Target, Toys R Us…. I find it very frustrating because when she was on a quest for a pony named Rainbow Dash, I found plenty of Tink-A-Tink-A Too. I eventually found Rainbow Dash, but this one is still eluding capture. She has a heck of a collection of My Little Ponies. Anyway, in other kid news, Carolynn would like to inform you that she has just acquired tickets to see American Idol Live at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee on July 22. She is so excited. She got Diana DeGarmo’s and Fantasia’s CD Singles yesterday. She is a heck of an American Idol fan. So anyway, do not forget starting Tuesday, it will be Pet Week here on the family website. Send me pictures of your pets (or pets you wish you had) or some amusing stories about your pets.   The weather today has been, in the words of Carolynn’s friend Morgan, “rainy and stupid.” It is nasty, humid, and raining. My homework is taking over my life. We put cable in Catherine’s room since her VCR finally broke. That VCR lasted a long time. That is the first one we ever got and we got it in 1997. Since we put cable in her room, she spends all her time watching cartoons and sports. She is so weird. She loves to watch baseball. Of course, I think that may be the only sport going on right now. I saw her watching tennis the other day. Phillip even saw her wrestling. Well, that is it for today.    Independence Weekend   Did you know that the Chinese invented fireworks in the 11th Century?    urlLink    Fireworks Display, New York City (Picture from www.webshots.com)&nbsp; urlLink      To help you celebrate safely this Fourth of July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Council on Fireworks Safety offer the following safety tips:   Always read and follow label directions.  Have an adult present. Buy from reliable sellers.  Use outdoors only. Always have water handy (a garden hose and a bucket). Never experiment or make your own fireworks.  Light only one firework at a time.  Never re-light a "dud" firework (wait 15 to 20 minutes and then soak it in a bucket of water).  Never give fireworks to small children.  If necessary, store fireworks in a cool, dry place.  Dispose of fireworks properly by soaking them in water and then disposing of them in your trashcan.  Never throw or point fireworks at other people.  Never carry fireworks in your pocket.  Never shoot fireworks in metal or glass containers.  The shooter should always wear eye protection and never have any part of the body over the firework.  Stay away from illegal explosives.

      I have nothing important planned for today. I have to go to the Sam’s Club, to the Wal-Mart, to the Victoria’s Secret, and a few other places. I have plenty of homework to occupy me. We will probably go over to the fireworks store so we have some on hand for this weekend. I am making spaghetti for dinner. I promised Carolynn I would make it for her. So anyway, I just thought you would like to know I got an A on my first history paper. I really enjoy school. I am such a nerd.   Well, thank you all for helping me with car week. It is good to know you all have such  realistic  car dreams. I will keep those in mind when I win a billion dollars and I can buy them for you all. I have decided that for next week I am having pet week. So email me pictures of your pets (or the pets you wish to have.) I think it is nice when everybody participates.  So do not forget!

      Today we went to the Denny’s for breakfast. Then we went over to the commissary to get some groceries. That is about it. I am working on some homework and I paid some bills. I lead an exciting life. Well, the other day was somewhat exciting. I swore I had felt an earthquake. It was freaking me out because this is Wisconsin. I thought I had finally lost it. I thought I missed California so much, I was imagining earthquakes in Wisconsin. So when Phillip came home, I told him and he said I was nuts too. Then later that day, on the news they said there really was an earthquake here. Its epicenter was in Illinois and people felt it all the way up to Milwaukee. At least I had not really lost my marbles. It has been pretty warm and humid the last few days. I have not felt this kind of weather since we were in Tennessee. Finally, we have summer weather.

I have issues with drinking the water that comes out of the faucet. The girls have been inside all day. Carolynn has been reading  Tales of the Fourth Grade Nothing  by Judy Blame. She says Fudge reminds her of Catherine. I do not think so. Catherine is coloring. She is getting really excited about school starting. According to the school calendar, they go back September 2. That is also the day Phillip takes his advancement exam. That is also a day I have a morning politics class. Guess who has to miss? Well, that is all for today.

       I am writing a paper about email addresses and other internet names. I want to know how many different ones do people have- email addresses, screen names, instant messenger names, and other online names. Why do people have so many different ones? What are each used for? Where did people come up with them? I for instance have a personal email, a school email, and a business email. I have an AOL Instant Messenger screen name, and a Final Fantasy XI Online game name. My personal email and AOL instant messenger are the same, Navywifejd. I came up with that since I am a navy wife and my initials are JD. Both my school email and my business emails are just my name followed by where they go. In addition, my video game person is called Kittybimbo, because the player I chose is a cat woman in thigh high boots and underwear. So what about you? How many do you have, what do you use them for, and how did you come up with them? Let me know.

       Well, Phillip upgraded his computer from Windows ME to Windows XP and now the scanner does not work. That really is making me mad because I had some cool pictures I wanted to scan and put on here. I will have to call HP (the maker of the scanner and the computer) and see if they have a way to fix it. I usually like HP products. Phillip’s computer and monitor are HP. My laptop is an HP. Both the printer and the scanner are HP. Hopefully there will be a way to work it out.  The weather is still beautiful. Carolynn has been outside enjoying it all day. Catherine was out there for a little while but she is inside playing a video game right now. Phillip and I are still trying to clean out the house. We have cleaned out a few rooms. I have been doing laundry. I am making lasagna for dinner. Really, Stouffers made the lasagna and I am just heating it up. Do not forget to send us your summertime adventures for tomorrow.

      Okay, these kids need to go back to school. It was a beautiful day outside. We were too worn out from hiking yesterday and we did all the yard work a few days ago, so we were missing out on the weather. The kids decided to miss out on the weather too. They decided to stay inside all day and bother me. Therefore, I have decided that as summer is drawing to a close, next week we will have Summer Time Fun Week. Send me some pictures of you enjoying the weather or tell us what you like to do when the weather is nice. Monday we will start.

It is better to be early that late.   urlLink    Hapy Birthday Dear Catherine???&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Buffalo Creek&nbsp; urlLink    Well, today we went hiking at Buffalo Creek. That is in Lake County, Illinois almost to Chicago from here. We hiked about five miles. The weather was good, not too hot. We took plenty of water with us. We took Priscilla with us too. Elvis will hike, but Priscilla likes it more. If we take both dogs then they are trouble. We had fun. Phillip is making brats for dinner.    urlLink    My Hiking Family&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Priscilla decided she was hot and took a little swim in Buffalo Creek.&nbsp; urlLink     Buffalo Creek   Most of this property was previously owned by the Popp family, who since early settlement times had farmed the rich land. The Popps initially had a dairy farm, and then converted to grain crops such as soybeans, wheat and corn. A rock with a plaque commemorating the Popp Farm can be found on the site. Acquisition of this land by the Lake County Forest Preserves took place in several purchases between 1978 and 1987. Due to the land’s suitability for flood control, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District assisted with some of the acquisition. (www.lcfpd.org)

      I was doing a little gardening. Phillip was weeding yesterday so I was looking at my garden. The carrots were ready. I was growing baby carrots. We picked them, cleaned them off, and ate them with ranch dressing.   urlLink    Garden Fresh Baby Carrots&nbsp; urlLink    The tomato bushes have green tomatoes on them. I am growing both regular sized tomatoes and cherry tomatoes. The cherry tomatoes had a few red ones but Catherine did not allow them to make it into the house.    urlLink    Tomatoes&nbsp; urlLink    The bell peppers and the green beans are coming along. They have flowers on them so we should get vegetables soon. Fresh green beans are good.   urlLink    Bell Peppers&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Green Beans&nbsp; urlLink    Today I am going to the mall to exchange Carolynn’s pants. We are going to the Best Buy to have them check out my computer. The touch pad has been sticking and it has been clicking stuff at random. It is annoying. Phillip had an eye doctor appointment this morning so he did not get home until late so he is sleeping today. We are having barbecued chicken for dinner. The weather was great yesterday. It never got past 74 degrees and was nice and sunny with a breeze. It is supposed to be the same for today and tomorrow. Tuesday night there was a massive thunderstorm and the power kept going out. Some of the thunder was shaking my house. It was making the dogs upset. Well, that is all the news that is fit to print today. I got this picture from my uncle. It is a picture of my Aunt Chris and her pack of dogs.    urlLink    Auntie Chris and the dogs&nbsp; urlLink      A Little Gardening Tip     What's the difference between an herb and a spice?      Culinary herbs are different from spices. Generally, the edible part of culinary herbs is fresh or dried leaves while the edible part of spices includes seeds, roots, fruits, flowers, and bark. Culinary herbs usually have a mild flavor while spices tend to have a strong, pungent flavor. However, the terms "herb" and "spice" are artificial categories, not a botanical designation of any kind. Common herbs include parsley, sage, and basil, and some common spices include cinnamon, cardamon, and ginger. From Ohio State University website.

       There is nothing exciting going on in my life today. We are still cleaning out the house. Carolynn is making a video of something. She was recording the pantry a little while ago. Catherine is having a tea party in her room. Phillip is going to do some weeding. We will probably play some video game or watch some TV. There is not much to watch on TV though. I got three new McDonald’s Beanie Bears. I got the Hamburglar, Happy Meal the Bear, and Shake the Bear. I also have an extra Hamburgler. So now, I have six out of twelve plus the extra one. Well, that is it for today.     I Thought This Was Funny    urlLink http://www.jibjab.com

      Okay, so yesterday did not go exactly as I had planned. I did not play any video games. I did clean out Catherine’s room. She had a ton of trash in there. The police brought Catherine home yesterday. What happened was this. She is grounded and not supposed to play outside. I was helping her clean her room. I was looking for something and Catherine said Carolynn had it. Therefore, I sent Catherine to go get Carolynn who was supposed to be in the back yard. She was playing outside when I had told her to go get Carolynn, not to play with chalk in the yard. She says she heard me calling her and knew she was in trouble. Therefore, she decided she better go find Carolynn. Except Carolynn was not home. So rather than get busted without Carolynn she decided to risk her life and cross the street to look for her. Of course, she is not allowed to cross the street. She never looks where she is going and yesterday was no different. She ran out in front of police car coming down our street and was escorted home by the officer she scared half to death. Apparently, that was enough to scare her into being good. She cleaned her room, the hallway, and down the stairs without another word. She is still grounded for stealing Poptarts. She lost her my little ponies for not cleaning her room. She lost her cable TV for staying up late and coloring on the walls and furniture. In addition, she lost one of her toy bins for being escorted home by the police. Carolynn is grounded for going to her friends without asking and for getting Catherine arrested. Therefore, after all that yesterday I never played any of my game. Today I am doing laundry. I am interviewing another real estate lady this afternoon. I am going to McDonald’s to get some Happy Meals so I can get the Beanie Bears. Anyway, I took some pictures of Catherine in her new school clothes. There is also a picture of Carolynn being silly. Enjoy!   urlLink    Catherine's new pony clothes  urlLink     urlLink    Catherine's new school clothes.  urlLink     urlLink    Carolynn in the navy.

      Well, if Phillip can spend all his time playing video games why can’t I? I worked hard this summer at school and there are only a couple of weeks before school starts again. Whoever said video games were only for guys? Nobody in this house that is for sure. So register your complaints for my lack of interesting webpage material to someone who cares. What is funny is when you turn the game on it specifically tells you not to forget about your family and friends. I was reading somewhere about a different online game (not naming names) that people got so involved with they were neglecting their families, not going to work, failing to consider their personal hygiene, and other such things. I know video games are fun and cool, but there is real life out there. Catherine will not have to worry about video games for a week since she is grounded for not cleaning up her room and sneaking food. I found a bunch of half-eaten Pop-tarts in her room. That is all for today.    At Least Someone Is Getting Outside And Enjoying The Warm Weather    urlLink    My friend Heather's son Joey. He is three and very cute. They live in Virginia.  urlLink      Just A Few Reasons To Not Neglect Your Friends And Family     Take the following quiz. You do not need a pen, pencil, or paper.      1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners. 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest. 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for Best Actor and Actress. 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series Winners.  How did you do? THE LESSON None of us remembers the headliners of yesterday. There are no second-rate achievers on the above quiz. They are the best in their fields. However, the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners. Now here is another quiz. See how you do on this one:  1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school. 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. 6. Name a half dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.  Wasn't that a lot easier? The lesson? The people who make a difference in your life aren't the ones with the most credentials, the most money, or the most awards. They are the ones who care enough to spend personal time and effort for you.
