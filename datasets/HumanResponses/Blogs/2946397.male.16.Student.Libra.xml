      i juz dun understand... why cant radio juz play songs.. and songs.. c'mon a little talk from the dj and songs... why the hellllllllllll are radio playing ad's and ad's and ad's.. they shuld make it ad radio instead. stupid dumbasses.. or call it news radio.. especially hitz.fm .  i've juz got no freakin idea why tht dumbass radio gets so much listeners.. and they say they're playin today's hit music.. sounds more like yesterday's yesterday's last years music...  they've got annoyin dj's makin stupid lame jokes. loads of ad's.  . and play shit music.  recommendation. listen to red104.9. they play songs wayyyy better than hitz. (its true) only tht on weekends they've got this malay thingie.. which juz spoils everythin.. damness.

      When Michelle was a little girl, I used to take her for walks in the park once a week. This was long before her parents were killed in an accident.    She was only about six or seven I think, when I first met her, at Aunty Cass's annual family get-together on Christmas. That year was so special, and a different sort of excitement infected us all as we waited impatiently for Aunty Fizzy and Uncle Sez to arrive. It was their first visit home since their wedding. I was too young to remember their wedding but Ken, my oldest cousin, would talk about that day occasionally. My aunts and uncles,and granny and grandpa especially, used to discuss it so often that i began to  see it as the event of the year.    Michelle was born a year and a half later, just a week before my fourth birthday. Even during my birthday party, all grandma and grandpa could talk about was the photographs. Aunty Fizzy had sent of little Michelle. I remember staring sulkily at a picture of my new, half-English cousin and swearing to myself that I would never ever have anything to do with Michelle.    In spite of my childish resolution, I was as excited and curious as everyone to meet Michelle for the first time.There was such a lot of noice and confusion at Aunty Cass's that evening.For once, nobody noticed when i casually dropped my vegetables on the floor for the dog to lick up. When the guests of honour finally arrived,everyone  began noisily welcoming the newcomers.    I pulled away from the others, and sat on the lowest step to observe this homecoming. Aunty Fizzy and Uncle Sez hugged and kissed everyone enthusiastically, making as much noice as everyone else. I craned my neck to look for Michelle, but all I could see were flashes of blue in the midst of grown-up legs.    She was the prettiest little girl I had ever seen, and i liked her immediately, with all my heart. Even so, i made a point to ignore her the whole evening, until even granny scolded me. And in injured silence, i walked away slowly to my bro's room where i was to sleep that night.    "Oh,oh!" i heard Ken shout behind me. "Dave's sulkin again!" Everyone laughed, I turned to look, and met Michelle's solemn, dignified gaze, I glared at her, then carried on my way quickly.    Three days later, without telling my other cousins, I rode over to granny's, just to see Michelle. She was swinging gently on the old rusty swing under the mango tree.    I asked her, in a quiet and unfriendly tone, if she would like a ride on my bicycle. She said nothing, but continued to look at me. Her large black eyes didn't even blink as she swung to and fro, slowly. She really did look like a princess. Her soft baby curls were pushed back by a silver hairband. Her skin was pale and delicate, of a wholesome milky hue that fascinated me. She was pretty, like Aunty Fizzy, with a sharp nose and thin, healthy pink lips. Her cheeks were a lovely rosy tinge. Finally, she spoke. "I don't wish to ride on your bicycle. But you may, if you want, take me for a walk in the park." Her child's voice was high and crisp.,she spoke in the same accent her father did. She was so different from any girl i've ever seen before.    I was totally shocked at my reply, though i had said it nonchalantly :  "All right. I'll take you, if you promise to marry me when we grow up."   She stopped the swing, and got off, very ladylike. She stood beside me,and looked up at me. Very seriously, she replied, "All right,then. Lets go"    This became our ritual time together for the next three weeks. We were friends, and knew it, but when we were with our other cousins, we ignored one another. It was not a planned thing at all, just the way we behaved when everyone was around.    The day before she flew back to London, she telephoned me, and reminded me solemnly that we were engaged, and that I was not to be unfaithful to her.She never wrote back to me, so i stopped writing too, after some time.     Three years later, her parents were killed in a car accident, and her English grandparents insisted that she lived with them. Granny and grandpa never got over that shock.     Tomorrow we will all gather at Aunty Cass's again. This time, I'm preoccupied with a different kind of excitement. I wonder what sort of woman Michelle has grown to be, and if she remembers me or our childish promise. I wonder what sort of man Tom is, the man she married last January...  ..
