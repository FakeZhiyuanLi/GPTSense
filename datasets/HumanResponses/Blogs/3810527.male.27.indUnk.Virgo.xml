      Last evening I purchased an Xbox game titled ESPN NFL 2K5. Not normally one to enjoy simulations (I play to escape reality. . . if you can call the NFL reality), I decided to pick this game up based on positive reviews and a good price-point. After a few minutes, I realized that the controls were beyond what I was willing to invest in at the moment. I decided to let the computer simulate an enitre game. The Colts were doing battle with the Bears on a cloudy afternoon at the new Soldier Field. The announcing was spot on, the crowd noises made it sound like I was actually sitting in the stadium, and watching the presention and player movements felt like I was watching an actual ESPN football game. Then something strange happened. . .     I stopped looking for graphical flaws and listening for audio miscues. I started watching the game. I started cheering for the Colts. I yelled to my wife to come over and watch the replay of Urlacher laying out payton Manning. The game had sucked me in.     It reminds me a bit of A.I. (The Spielberg movie, not the overrated basketball player.) I knew that the game wasn't real, but I didn't care. I knew that the athletes I was watching were simply polygons floating around on screen bumping into other polygons, but my brain suppressed that. I was watching Peyton Manning gun a 15 yard slant pass to a diving Marvin Harrison.     I don't know where this revolution will lead or how it will change the way that we live our lives and enjoy our entertainment, but I do feel that the shift out of reality is closer than any of us realize.      Oh, by the way - Harrison almost brought in that beatiful diving catch. Unfortunately, as he reached out for the one-handed grab, Brian Urlacher hit him with a full head of steam. The trainers had to come take him off the field and his status is still pending.

      I've recently discovered this insatiable drive to expand my musical horizons.  This should scare anyone who knows me, being as I already listen to anything from Cecilia Bartoli to Metallica, from Johnny Clegg and Savuka to Queen.  Here is my latest iTunes purchase: The Chieftains, Van Morrison, SonicFlood, EMF, Moby, Sophie B. Hawkins, B2K, Green Day, Godsmack, Rage Against the Machine, P.O.D., and Queen.  Put all that in a blender and you have quite the cocktail. . .   As I lay me down to sleep, sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. Now is my time, my power is in my own hand. Those who died are justified and I'm running blind. Yet in the end you're so good to me. . . You're unbelievable.  Disturbing . . . but catchy.  And in other news - John Kerry has picked John Edwards to be his running mate.  Personally, John Edwards has more appeal to me as a Presidential candidate than Kerry.  Apparently, I was not as excited about this announcement as some others were.  After watching the mainstream media's reaction yesterday, you could easily have mistaken that Kerry won the Superbowl and that Edwards was the Second Coming (for those of you who are still confused, he's not.  He is a trial lawyer from Missouri.)  Katie Couric and Matt Lauer could only be described as giddy.  CNN's Paula Zahn invited Louisiana's John Breaux (Democratic) and the Rev.  Al Sharpton (Psychotic Democrat) on her show to discuss the pros and cons of the Edwards nomination. . . Way to once again get both sides of the story, CNN!  If it weren't for Anderson Cooper, I would be tempted to add CNN to my blocked list along with MTV, E!, and the "adult" channels.  There are some things that are simply not worth watching.  Don't get the mistaken impression that I am a FOX junkie just because I don't care for CNN.  Personally, I prefer C-SPAN.  The best way to judge a person's character is to watch them in action, not to listen to stories about them.

      I just finished implementing the co-location project (without a hitch), Ken Jennings once again decimated the opposition, and speculation is still running rampant about John Kerry's running mate.  You have to feel bad for Kerry; he has people publicly turning him down before he even makes the offer.  It's the equivalent of everyone finding out that you are looking for a Friday night date and quickly calling you to say that they "just want to be friends".  The only one left is going to be the ugly girl in the corner. . . Howard Dean, anyone?  A Kerry-Dean ticket could give Penn and Teller a run for their money.  I think Kerry should turn the whole VP mess over to the FOX network.  I can see the reality series already.  It would look like some sick amalgamation of The Simple Life and Who Wants to Marry My Dad.  And now for something completely unrelated:    Today's recommended reading is Utopia by Lincoln Child.  You may remember Child as half of the duo that wrote Relic, Reliquary, and the Ice Limit (Ice Limit sidenote:  whoever thought that a book about lifting something heavy could be so fascinating or scary?)  Utopia is a techno-thriller set in the world's most advanced theme park.  Child has a great vision of future technology and a knack for smoothly integrating it into the story. . . It reminds me in some ways of Jules Verne.  Also, it's a nice change when you have an techno-thriller author that actually understands technology.  Utopia could be  nicely adapted into the next season of 24. . . now there's a thought.

      Not really,  it's just been one of those days.  I've been working on a network co-location project that is about to drive me mad.  Things have gone so badly with this project that I even had my credit card rejected for sushi. . . My vendor keeps sending the wrong equipment and then billing me each time they ship the replacements.  I have so many RMA forms printed out that I am considering a new wallpaper theme for my office.  This project is trying to encompass my life and then destroy it.  The joys of owning your own company.  Meanwhile, I had another client that needed a Sony Vaio CD-R replacement.  I had one all wrapped up on E-bay only to be sniped at the last second.  That is what I get for making the claim that I can find anything.  Oh well,  tommorrow is the first part of the rest of our lives that we haven't lived yet. . .  Musings . . . Go Ken Jennings!  Personally, I'm guessing he's got a trojan or keystroke logger running on the Jeopardy network, but he sure is fun to watch.    Here's a little assistance for the Oscar judges next year (courtesy of dictionary.com):  doc·u·men·ta·ry adj.     1. Consisting of, concerning, or based on documents.    2. Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.   prop·a·gan·da n.     1. The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.    2. Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.   Fahrenheit 9/11 may be an entertaining film, but please never, NEVER, mistake this for a documentary.
