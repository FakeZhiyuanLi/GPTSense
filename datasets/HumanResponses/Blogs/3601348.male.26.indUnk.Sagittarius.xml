      Say it out loud.  It's still not funny, but you get it, right? I suppose it's a good sign that all this news is coming out; perhaps it means the situation is coming to a head.  Or maybe Selig will ignore it and keep the Expos barnstorming another year.    Rather than summarize today's news, I advise you to have a look at  urlLink this post  from Off Wing Opinion.  I'll add  urlLink this story  from ESPN, which I can't read because I'm not about to pay to read Neyer.  Vidro and Cabrera are pissed about the whole thing, and who can blame them?   There is a column  I want to talk about, though.  USA Today  urlLink reported  that the Relocation Committee is leaning towards either DC or Northern Virginia.  They also ran a  urlLink story  by Hal Bodley ranking the six finalists in the Expos sweepstakes.  This latter story is unforgivably sloppy or biased.  Or both.   Bodley lists the finalists  along with a demographic analysis and the pros and cons of each city/secluded suburban enclave.  Now, most of my argument depends on this fact, so pay attention: Loudoun County and DC are listed as having the exact same demographic information - same TV households, same median income, same everything.  Bear that in mind.  Here are two of the advantages for Loudoun: • Site would have less attendance impact on the Baltimore Orioles than Washington.  • Loudoun County is the fastest-growing county in the United States, with the population climbing 30% from 2000 to 2003.   Now hold on just a damn minute!  Bodley is assuming that a DC site would hurt the Orioles more than a NoVa site (Angelos doesn't seem to agree, but more on that later).  But how is this possible when the two locations are drawing on the  exact same 7,608,070 people?   It's one or the other - either NoVa doesn't impinge on Baltimore, or they draw from Montgomery and Prince George's Counties.  You can't have it both ways.  If it's the latter, Loudoun's growth should be included under DC's advantages as well.  Here's another "advantage": • Amended plans addressed concerns about traffic congestion. Where?  Did they install a teleportation device?  Did the Metro get extended over the weekend and I didn't hear about it?  Furthermore, how is this an advantage?  At best, it's a disadvantage that has been addressed.  At worst, it's just a disadvantage.   From the con side: • Fans from Washington might not be attracted to a suburban site. As I mentioned  urlLink earlier  (at the top of my lungs with one finger extended), the Loudoun Cabal doesn't  want  fans from Washington.  Quoting from the  urlLink Times story : And in a slight nod to the remoteness of the site, Collins said he didn't plan to market the team extensively to fans in the District, Montgomery and Prince George's counties and Southern Maryland.  "We've always looked south and west of the [Potomac]," Collins said. "Nothing has really changed there. In this area, you do not want to cross any bridges." They know full well Washingtonians and Marylanders won't come to these games.  I know it, they know it, you know it, but Bodley either doesn't know it or chooses not to mention it.   On to the DC bit.   He includes this in the advantages: • Economic proposal, as presented, is the best of the six. I have no way of knowing if this is true.  Feel free to holler at me (as the kids say) if you do.  Very interesting, regardless.  Disadvantages: • Impact on attendance of the Baltimore Orioles, about 40 miles away. O's owner Peter Angelos might require compensation for lost revenue. I repeat myself: you can't give DC's demographics to Loudoun without giving DC's Angelos problem to them as well. • Placing a team there would not be as bold an expansion as it would be in Monterrey, Mexico, or Las Vegas. What the hell are you talking about?  For one thing, this is a really stupid way to look at it.  Let's expand to Sri Lanka - that's hella bold.  For another, why didn't you mention this in the NoVa bit?  HUH? • MLB strongly considers advantages of downtown stadiums, but Washington is unique. Most of the people who work there don't live there. This supposed disadvantage is possibly the biggest advantage DC has over NoVa.  As has been noted by others, DC's transit system is designed to bring people from the suburbs into downtown.  It sure isn't built to take people into Loudoun County.  Try it.   Go read the whole thing.  I haven't addressed all the points, and I left out his analysis of the other four bids entirely (they don't seem all that likely, and I'm getting too verbose as it is).  It certainly seems to me that USA Today has staked a position.  Both the articles linked above have a lovely graphic of what a Loudoun stadium would look like.  I find it hard to believe that the groups in DC, Vegas, etc. didn't bother to get some neat pictures done, yet USA Today chose to run two from the NoVa crowd.  Eric at Off Wing points out that the paper is "headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia, about 20 minutes from the proposed ballpark."  The author of this piece clearly manipulates his factoids to make the NoVa bid look better.  What do you think?   One more thing  before I go watch the Sox/Yankees game.  From MLB's standpoint, what is the appeal of the Loudoun bid?  Bodley comments that the DC plan is the best from a financial standpoint (I'm not talking about the morality or efficacy of a DC stadium).  If he's right (I certianly don't know if he is), isn't that MLB's overriding consideration?  The Loudoun plan has the advantage of being already legislated, but it seems clear that the DC plan would be passed without difficulty as soon as MLB gave the word.  The other hurdle, of course, is Peter Angelos.  Loudoun backers insist that their scenario hurts the O's less than DC's, but I don't buy it.  Angelos is more concerned about his broadcast rights than about the physical presence of DCers at Camden, and you can bet the Virginia Monologues (props to  urlLink Forklift , if that is your real name) would have their games broadcast round these parts.  If Angelos really thought the Loudoun plan was preferable, he would have come out in favor of it.  Instead, he has endorsed a no-hope Puerto Rico plan.  So tell me (and I'm asking seriously): why would baseball choose Loudoun over DC?

      I can't decide if that small dark cloud is getting bigger and darker.  Every bit of news or opinion I hear sends me into new spasms of elation or despair.  I'm going to blame my ulcer on Angelos, too.   Speak of the Devil,  they say, and he pops in up the Washington Times.  Dig  urlLink this : Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, still vehemently opposed to baseball in the Washington area, is lending his support to a late entry bid for the Montreal Expos from Puerto Rico. On balance, I declare this good news.  It's not quite as satisfying as the resigned, despondent Angelos we saw a couple weeks ago, but this means that he has not thrown his support behind the Loudoun bid.  That removes one of the reasons the Cabal gave for why MLB should pick them.  Given that Puerto Rico's a lost cause, I'll take this.   The news is not all good.   The Post concluded its three-part series on Bud Selig's reign of terror, and I'm less hopeful than ever.  (I broke down and registered -  urlLink here's  a roundup of the whole situation.  Very handy.)  From the third part: Selig, according to a major league official familiar with the process, had asked the relocation committee to look for alternatives to the District and Northern Virginia. Washington and Northern Virginia, he said, were not allowed to be "meaningfully discussed" because of Angelos's opposition and Selig's "unwavering support of Peter," the official said. Read the whole thing.  Also read the  urlLink chat  with author of the series, Steve Fainaru.  While you're at it, check out the  urlLink Primer thread .   So, some good news, lots of bad.   Maybe we'll look back at this and laugh.  But I have a feeling we'll look back at this and weep.  Or at least I will.  But I'm sensitive like that.

      I started this blog thinking that a team in DC was a  fait accompli , as the Expos fans say.  I knew that I was running the risk of making my disappointment even worse, but I figured DC just made too much sense.  I should have realized that "sense" doesn't have anything to do with how baseball makes its decisions.  This Post series on Selig has me pretty bummed.  I knew Selig was incompetent and sleazy, but I managed to put it out of my mind.  Having it front and center just reminds me that the leadership of baseball does not have the game's best interests in mind.  I can't blame them for being concerned with money.  I can't blame them for trying to avoid paying for stadia.  But I can blame them for making a free stadium their only concern, for leaving a team in limbo to extort cities, for allowing baseball in Montreal to wither and die, for the farce of contraction, and for a multitude of other things.  I actually agree with George Will that baseball is is in a Golden Age, but this is the case in spite of Selig and Co., not because of it.  Will Carroll  urlLink thinks  the DC bid is dead.  He's been wrong before, but I still don't like hearing it.  (Check the comments - I have to agree with Yuda's suggestion for the name of a Loudoun team.  Ignore that Ryan guy and his potty humor.)  One the other hand, Pedro alerted me to  urlLink this  from Gammons: Montreal may have to take offers on Tony Armas Jr. as well as Orlando Cabrera, if he proves he is as healthy as he appeared Thursday. Omar Minaya had inquiries on Brad Wilkerson, and refused to talk, figuring he wants every possible good player in Washington next season. Now, it's quite possible that Gammons isn't differentiating between DC and Virginia, but it still sounds good.  (By the way, I know we have some Expos fans around here - what's the verdict on Wilkerson?  He put up a .380 OBP last year, and that's the only stat I care about.)  In spite of Gammons' off-hand comment, I feel as bad about DC's chances as I have since I started this blog years ago. This may be a product of my place of residence, but I haven't heard much buzz about the Expos going to Norfolk or Portland or Vegas (except from Carroll), and Monterrey and San Juan never had a shot.  I'm pretty confident that the team will end up somewhere around here, but that's what's making me nervous.  It's well established the MLB loves free stadia, and that means Loudoun.  Loudoun means the cruel scenario of the Squires or whatever whiling away three years at RFK before they brave the gridlock for Diamond Lake Stadium.  I would not support a team in that situation - they may as well go to Mexico as I'm concerned.  For now, all we can do is wait, and we don't even know how long.  We'll sit around, and sit around, and wait            -Pere Ubu,  A Small Dark Cloud

      "That's not Latin!" - Lisa Simpson.   Dorcus Malorcus  may not be Latin, but this is.  Here are the Latin names of the 30 MLB teams, broken down by division.  Big ups to Karen for assistance.  And for putting up with my dorkness.   NL EAST  Atanta  Fortes  Florida  Tetrapturi  Montreal  Expositiones  New York  Urbani  Philadelphia  Philadelphienses   Notes: for a lot of the animal names, I just used the scientific names.  The Romans didn't know what a marlin was.  "Metropolitan" is derived from Greek, and a Roman would have known what it meant, but I translated it into a Latin word.   Philadelphienses  doesn't mean anything but Philadelphians, and I'm not aware of any other meaning of "Phillies."  The Expos could (should) find themselves as the  Senatores ,  Nationales , or  Cani  (Grays).   NL CENTRAL  Chicago  Ursuli  Cincinnati  Russati  Houston  Stellae  Milwaukee  Cervesarii  Pittsburgh  Praedones  St. Louis  Cardinales   Notes: The Cubs  urlLink seem to like   Catuli , which works for any cute, fuzzy animal baby.   Ursuli  is more specific.  The  Russata  was one of the chariot racing factions of Rome, so I used that instead of  rubra  or  rosa  or something.  "Astros" comes from the Greek for "star," so there's  Stellae .  Dumb name.   NL WEST  Arizona  Crotali  Colorado  Saxosi  Los Angeles  Eludentes  San Diego  Patres  San Francisco  Gigantes    AL EAST  Baltimore  Oriolidae  Boston  Udones Russati  New York  Iohannes  Tampa Bay  Diaboli Raiae  Toronto  Cyanocittae   Notes: Romans didn't really wear socks, and  udo  was the closest thing I could find.  "Yankees" was tough; no one really knows where it comes from.  The going theory is that it's the Dutch equivalent of "Johnny," so they're the Johns.  Make your own joke.   Diaboli Raiae  is literally "rays of the devil."   Diabolos , devil, is Greek for "slanderer."  Is that the worst they could say about him?   AL CENTRAL  Chicago  Udones Albi  Cleveland  Aborigines  Detroit  Tigres  Kansas City  Regales  Minnesota  Gemini   Notes: For Cleveland, I chose to go with a word meaning "natives" rather than "people from India."   AL WEST  Anaheim  Angeli  Oakland  Athletici  Seattle  Nautae  Texas  Pervagati   Notes: Two Greek words here, but they were both used by the Romans.   Angelos  in Greek meant nothing more than "messenger" until it picked up the Christian connotation (In modern English, Angelos means something entirely different).   Nuntius  is the Latin translation, but it never took on that meaning, so I kept  Angeli .   Athletici  is Greek, too.  "Rangers" is really difficult.  Do you try to capture the police sense of the word?  The army?  Guy in charge of a forest?   Pervagatus  more or less means "one who ranges," so I went with that.  Try them with  regunt  ( Cardinales regunt : Cardinals rule!) or  sugunt  ( Iohannes sugunt : Yankees suck!).   UPDATE : The comments for this post are a cavalcade of edutainment.  Seriously.

      We had a good time at the O's game.  The contest itself was pretty uneventful - the Braves scored two in the first and three in the ninth, and that's all they needed.  The Orioles have been getting better performances from their starters lately, but it hasn't translated into many wins.  They wasted a really impressive game from Matt Riley today.  The most memorable part of the excursion came on the way back to the car.  Apparently there was karaoke going on at Max's after the game, and a probably-drunk guy was singing "House of the Rising Sun."  And he was singing the HELL out it.  His voice kept us company all the way back to the garage.   Meanwhile, things are afoot  in the DC baseball world.  Primer has a  urlLink roundup  of columns arguing against Loudoun and for downtown.  The Washington Post today ran the first in a three-part series about the whole situation.  I'm still not linking to the Post, but it's worth checking out.  Today's installment went in depth into Milwaulkee's new stadium fiasco, and discussed at some length what a crook Bud Selig is.  Check this out: . . . Baseball had entered its second year of ownership of the Montral Expos, having taken over the team in February 2002 after a failed effort to "contract" Montreal and another franchise.  The strategy had grown out of desire to lop off baseball's weakest teams.  The process had started with a long list of potential victims.  None of them was the Milwaukee Brewres. Bud Selig just got served.  The article includes a list of of the new parks since Camden, including a breakdown of the costs.  Turner Field is the only park since 1992 to be built without public funds, though only 3% of SBC Park in San Francisco was paid for by the people.  Tomorrow's article will focus on the plight of the Expos and the infamous antitrust exemption, and Wednesday's will cover the relationship of Bud and evil rat-creature Peter Angelos.   In really astounding news,  MLB  urlLink announced  the relocation announcement will not be made at the All-Star break.  I'm angry but not surprised.  There's a brief but interesting  urlLink discussion  at the Primer - are they trying to up the ante on bids for the Expos?  Are they trying to hold out until the Spos can be contracted?  Or are they just that disorganized?  I think the first possibility is most likely, but the third is sound as well.  If David Stern ran baseball, I think the Expos (at least) would be a lot better off.

      With apologies to the Evangelist.  Tomorrow I'm going to Baltimore to see thrilling interleague action as the Braves take on the Orioles.  If I were a man of principle, I'd boycott the Orioles, but I'm not.  I'm a man who likes baseball and doesn't want his girlfriend mad at him, so off I go.  It's Rivalry Weekend in baseball, the only part of interleague play anyone cares about anymore, near as I can tell.  The Mets play the Yankees, the Dodgers play the Angels, and maybe the Cards and Royals will get into another brawl.  No doubt you all have been waiting for Distinguished Senator's Official Opinion on Interleague Play, and here it is:  Junk it.  It's been eight years, everyone has played everyone else, and the thrill is gone.  Shelve it for twenty years; if there's interest in 2024, bring it back.  I'm not philosophically opposed to interleague.  In some areas, I am a purist: I loathe the DH, and I was violently opposed to Selig's radical realignment plans.  On the other hand, I have nothing against the Wild Card or expansion.  I was intrigued when interleague play started - I remember getting Chinese food and watching the Giants beat the Rangers in the first game.  My objection at this point has everything to do with my personal biases as a fan and nothing to do with the Greater Good of the Game.  Several years ago, I was spending the summer at my ancestral home in Colorado.  The Rockies were an interesting team that year.  It seemed as though they'd be down going into the ninth in every home game, and they'd pull out the win more often than not.  They were even in first place for a few days.  I really started looking forward to the day's game, and I became very well acquainted with NL West teams, the Giants especially.  I knew the starters, I knew the bench guys, I even knew the bullpen.  But then, interleague started.  A's vs. Rockies - that didn't have any divisional significance.  Cards vs. Indians - irrelevant.  I like intra-divisional games and plenty of 'em.  I'd be happier if teams played one series with each team in the same league but other divisions, and spent the rest of the year with its real rivals.  You'd have a lot fewer situations like the Cards not playing the Cubs at all after mid-July.  Sure, Orioles vs. D-Rays is not an ideal matchup, but it's marginally more interesting than Orioles vs. Royals, and you'd get more games with the Yankees.  Now, I know people in New York, Chicago, LA, the Bay Area, Missouri, and Texas probably love interleague.  But what about the rest of us, stuck with Orioles/Braves or Red Sox/Phillies?  Well, check this out: I was reading a  urlLink biography  of hard-hittin' rat bastard Rogers Hornsby, who played for the Cardinals and the Browns when St. Louis had two teams (in fact, the Browns were clearly the favored team until Hornsby showed up, rather like Ruth pushing the Giants out of prominence in New York).  Before and after most seasons, the two teams played heated, profitable exhibition series.  If New Yorkers want so badly to see the Mets and Yankees square off, why not do this?  They could make a trophy, carry it on local TV, Keith Hernandez and Don Mattingly could talk trash, the whole megillah.  Hell, after the season, I'd be so starved for baseball that I'd watch it.  POSTSCRIPT: The Rockies wound up collapsing in the second half in whatever year that was.  That collapse persists to this very day.

      A few things I've been meaning to mention:   It takes a lot  for me to root for the Yankees.  If they were playing a team of Soviet supermen who had just killed Apollo Creed, they'd have my support.  Tonight's game comes close to that kind of moral contrast.  It's Jose Contreras vs.  urlLink Sidney Ponson .  I have nothing against Ponson and I even like the Orioles, but there's more to it.  Contreras is a Cuban defector who was just  urlLink reunited  with his wife and two daughters, who had been held on the island until they bolted in speedboat with 18 other refugees. Ponson's boss is a man who  urlLink thinks  MLB teams shouldn't sign defectors for fear that they be encouraged to defect.  Heavens forbid! So, tonight I say Go Yankees.  UPDATE Man, am I an idiot.  Contreras didn't even pitch this game, and I don't know why I thought he was going to.  I guess I'll be rooting for him on Saturday.   I listened to the Expos  today on MLB Audio (a fine service).  The Expos' announcers, in case you're interested, have thicker Canadian accents than the Blue Jays'.  It was a good game.  Tony Armas pitched well, Nick Johnson got on base four times, and the Expos won.  Nick Johnson's moustache is so ugly, by the way, that I swear I could hear it.   The site I insist  on calling Baseball Primer has two articles of interest to DC baseball afficionadi.  There's a  urlLink review  of a book entitled  Beyond the Shadow of the Senators , which concerns Buck Leonard, the Homestead Grays, and black baseball in DC generally.  There's also an  urlLink interview  with the author, Brad Snyder, and it's interesting in its own right.  . . . there is a group of people who would like to call Washington’s next major league team the Washington Grays. This group will be establishing a website at washingtongrays.com  The site's not there yet, but I'll keep you posted.  Snyder's next project is a book about free-agency martyr Curt Flood, a worthy topic indeed.   I promise I'm almost done  with this, but Off Wing Opinion had  urlLink another post  about the stadium controversy.  I shall address two points and lay it to rest.  Eric says in response to my bit about taking that economics professor on a date around Camden Yards: But what Ryan won't talk about is what Baltimore looks like only a few blocks West of Max's down past the Baltimore Arena. What he'll see there is a depressed neighborhood that fans work hard to avoid on their way to the stadium. Why would I?  I never claimed that baseball stadia eradicate poverty and violence.  Some improvement is better than none, and the contrast between the areas affected and unaffected by all this commerce reinforces my point.  Then there's this:  That's why we call in the wonks -- the people who can do a serious cost/benefit analysis of a project, and tell us what the truth is beyond what we can plainly see with our own eyes. In this case, does the ancillary economic activity generated by a ballpark justfiy the additional public expenditures required to build it?  And the wonks, time and again, have said no. In a way, we need to be sure we're analyzing and measuring the right stats in order to get to the truth -- which sounds a lot like the idea behind baseball's own incredible wonkfest, Sabermetrics.  I'm all for listening to the experts.  They are, by definition, more qualified than your average fellow.  But what happens when the expert says something you know isn't right?  The sabermetric example is perfect.  I believe in the importance of OBP, drafting college players, mocking Tim McCarver, and all those other sabermetric commandments.  But I believe in them because they make sense.  Some years ago, Total Baseball came up with Total Player Rating, a precursor to Bill James' Win Shares in that it attempted to sum up the totality of a player's contribution in one handy number.  Pete Palmer is certainly an expert in the matter, and his conclusions included the stat that  urlLink Nap Lajoie  is the sixth-best player of all time.  It's perfectly obvious to anyone with any knowledge of baseball history that Lajoie is NOT the sixth-best player of all time, no matter what the numbers say.  People knew it wrong even before the sifted through the data, and now TPR is not much used.  Similarly, I'm inclined to listen to an economist until he says something like "you can't have a sports bar by a ballpark."  It doesn't take a PhD to notice that downtown ballparks are practically encased in thriving sports bars, and such a statement would of course make me skeptical of the rest of the guy's findings.  Experts should be heard, but they should not be unquestioned.

      Forget everything I've said in the history of this blog and read  urlLink this : Washington's status as a popular locale for fledgling start-up pro leagues continues with the creation of American Pro Cricket.      The eight-team league, playing a modified, shortened version of a sport wildly popular in England, India, Australia, South Africa and Pakistan, will have an entry called the D.C. Forward playing at Prince George's Stadium in Bowie. League play starts July 2 and ends two months later with a championship game in New Jersey. Virginia can have their baseball team - I'll be rooting for the Forward!  I'll see you hillbillies at the tea interval!

      That's me that got owned.  Eric at  urlLink Off Wing Opinion  didn't agree with my spittle-flecked rant from yesterday.  There's the problem with spittle-flecked rants: the one that pleases everyone has yet to be written.  I shall do what rebutting I can and attempt to refrain from the all-caps typing and swears I find myself drawn to in my more passionate moments.  Eric does not address my fundamental, most spittle-inducing concern.  Nobody is going to be able to get to these games.  The logic of putting the team in the middle of a huge chunk of people rather than at one end is so obvious that I'm astonished Loudoun's proposal is being taken seriously.  But on to what Eric does address.  His main argument seems to be that DC can't afford it.  First, he concedes the following:  Because the transportation infrastructure in the Washington Metropolitan Area was designed to move government employees from the suburbs to downtown, putting a stadium there makes the most sense. The roads are there, the Metro is there, the tourists are there.   But then we cue the ominous music:  Unfortunately, given the District's history of fiscal irresponsibility, building a new ballpark would probably fall on the backs of local taxpayers -- something that's bound to make Washington a less attractive place to do business. And the plan that Mayor Anthony Williams has proposed to the D.C. City Council, but has yet to be approved (thanks to City Councilman Jack Evans), puts the onus of paying for the new stadium on businesses that are overtaxed already. I think that Eric here slightly misrepresents Evans' opposition.  According the Post  urlLink article  he cites, Evans is not at all opposed to the plan, only to uncertainty.  "When they tell me they're going to put a team here, we'll get the job done" sounds like a minor hurdle rather than a significant roadblock.  The funding is there, pending MLB's announcement.  Now, the big (only?) selling point of the Loudoun stadium is that there would be no new taxation to pay for it, making it unique in that regard.  Furthermore, I have no business calling on DC to buy me a stadium.  As a resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, Ryan may not care that the folks in the District are going to be asked to pay for the ballpark he so dearly wants downtown. It is only fair to point that as a resident of northern Virginia, Eric would have no problem getting to games in Loudoun. Marylander though I be, I would not endorse a plan to put a team in some out-of-the-way corner of the Old Line State, accessible only to those on my side of the river.  Let's have a look at those taxes (from the same Post story):  D.C. officials say they plan to pay for the stadium with revenue bonds, financed with three potential sources of revenue: sales taxes on stadium services, including tickets, parking and concessions; lease payments from the new team at sites other than RFK; and a new tax on the city's largest businesses. That's one tax paid by the District's businesses, one tax paid by the Senators, and one paid, at least in part, by Ryan.  Major sporting events draw customers (or, if you prefer, marks or rubes or pigeons) to the stadium.  Along the way, they eat, drink, and be merry.  I, for one, plan on going to a lot of games and drinking a lot of beer.  That means money coming out of Montgomery County and into the District.  Obviously, none of this is news to anyone, but it must be considered.  Eric cites a Post  urlLink article  by a Cato Institute wonk saying that publicly-funded stadia aren't worth it.  This is interesting, because a few days earlier I had read a Baltimore Sun  urlLink article  that presented both sides of this issue. Stanford University economics professor Roger Noll argues that sports facilities can be justified only as a quality-of-life proposition, not as a sound financial investment. Stadiums don't usually generate a lot of nearby economic activity because team owners sell so much inside the stadium, he said.  "It makes no sense to build a sports bar across the street," said Noll, who edited a 1997 book about the economic impact of athletics. "No one ever comes to your sports bar because there's already five other sports bars in the stadium. ... It is really an anomaly to have the kind of comprehensive development around a stadium that occurred around the MCI Center." One wonders if Roger Noll has ever been to a sporting event.  I hereby invite him to join me at Max's, a sports bar across the street from Camden Yards.  We'd better get there early, though - it's tough to get in before a game.  Then we could get a hat and a hot dog from street vendors, and hit the Inner Harbor for crabcakes after the game (NB: I'm not hitting on Roger Noll).  The article goes to quote some business owners who apparently are not aware that they're going bankrupt. Capital Restaurant Concepts, which operates 13 properties in Baltimore, Virginia and Washington, has no complaints. It gets larger crowds at its two Inner Harbor sites when the Orioles are playing.  "It does spill out," said company co-founder Paul J. Cohn, who favors a downtown site such as Camden Yards. And in DC? The downtown Renaissance Hotel is near the New York Avenue site, so its officials are eager to see baseball come to town, especially at that location.  "We'll keep our fingers crossed," said hotel marketing director Jon Lockwood.   Maybe the pundits are right.  Maybe the tax-funded stadium is an awful idea.  But then again, maybe the politicians and business owners know what they're doing.  Why do so many cities pay for stadiums?  Could so many mayors and city councils really be that dim?  Swallowing my cynicism for a moment, I find that unlikely.  So, do they want teams to generate money?  That's a good reason.  Or do they want them to please their constituents?  That's a good one as well.  "Stanford University economics professor Roger Noll argues that sports facilities can be justified only as a quality-of-life proposition . . ."  Good lord, Noll, isn't that enough?   There is also the team to be considered.   As I yelled about in my rant, the Loudoun Cabal seems to be content with utter failure from an attendance standpoint.  Fewer fans at the games means fewer people in the bars and restaurants, fewer bobblehead dolls and souvenier bats being sold, fewer eight dollar beers being quaffed, and ultimately worse TV viewership and less enthusiasm for the team.  Do we want our team to content itself with being a Brewers-esque welfare queen, perfectly happy to turn a profit by maintaining a low payroll and pocketing the revenue sharing money?  Maybe the Virginians will succeed in buying their toy baseball team and build the country's most gorgeous stripmall ballpark, but don't expect the rest of us not to fight it.  UPDATE.   urlLink Josh Heit  throws some doubt on the Loudoun plan's rosy economic outlook.

      Strong words, but I don't pass on a  urlLink PJ O'Rourke  reference when it's sitting right there.  The big news today is that a posse of jockjaws out in the boonies of northern Virginia has finalized a plan to make damn sure the Expos never draw any fans.  You can read about it  urlLink here  or  urlLink here , among other places.  I'll be referring to the ESPN version unless otherwise noted, and I'm skipping around.   HERNDON, Va. -- A proposal by state and local officials to move the Montreal Expos to the nation's fastest-growing county features a public-private partnership that requires no new taxes to pay for the $442 million ballpark, proponents said Monday. The proposal gives northern Virginia a leg up on the other regions bidding for the Major League Baseball franchise because it is the only site competing for the Expos with a fully financed funding plan on the books, said Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority Chairman Keith Frederick. Monterrey never had a chance.  Moving on . . .  The plan calls for building a 42,500-seat stadium near Dulles International Airport, on the outer edge of the Washington, D.C. suburbs. The ballpark would be part of a town square-style development that would include residential, retail and commercial space. Translation: suburban stripmall.  The Dulles site is one of five that has long been under consideration for a northern Virginia ballpark, but it had once been considered at the bottom of the list because of traffic problems. The fast-growing county already suffers from traffic that often approaches gridlock, and public transportation does not currently extend from Washington. In fact, Monday's rally to announce the plan was delayed by about 10 minutes because traffic slowed the arrival of some VIPs. Ha!  The overwhelming power of irony is becoming something of a theme around here. The problem is that no matter how much money these yuppies throw around, the traffic is still going to be awful.  Loudoun County appears to be welcoming the possibility of a ballpark. Supporters cite transportation improvements under way and under consideration, including a possible extension of Metrorail to the site by 2012. The ballpark would be built in 2008, with games played at Washington's RFK Stadium until then. Oh, well that makes it okay.  DC gets the team for three years until the yuppies are ready for them.  Then maybe we get to go see them five years later.  Supporters now also cast the Dulles site's distance from Washington as a plus, saying it should assuage concerns of Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos that a D.C.-area team will hurt his franchise. You people are already guilty by association, then.  Here's a rule of thumb: if Angelos approves, you shouldn't be doing it.  Which is why I try to sign as many Cuban defectors as possible.  Major League Baseball had been concerned that requiring an owner to make a large upfront payment for a ballpark would reduce the ability of any ownership group to pay a competitive price for the Expos. I wonder if they're as concerned about the go-away money Angelos is supposed to get.  Stadium Authority Director Gabe Paul said the financing plan would be solvent even if the franchise drew only 1 million fans a year. "We could have the lowest attendance in baseball and this plan still works," Paul said.  NO IT DOESN'T YOU DUMBSHIT!  One million fans is failure, no matter how much cash you sling around.  For a newly relocated team, one million fans is a huge, amazing failure.  Look at that quotation again: this asshead would be happy with the LOWEST ATTENDANCE IN BASEBALL, as long as a few suburban families don't have to go downtown.  In a way, I can't blame these people.  They want a baseball team in their backyard.  They want to be able to take their kids to see a real, live baseball team without having to go into the city, where the wild things are.  They don't care if no one in Maryland or DC comes - they can pay for their toy.  The crime of it is that this is being seriously considered by baseball.  The Expos could move downtown and draw two and half million, easy, and THAT should be MLB's concern.  Suppose an eccentric billionaire wanted to buy the Expos.  He could pay double what anyone else could.  However, he would insist that all home games be played on the grounds of his estate and would not be open to the public.  Is that good for business?  Obviously not.  Yet this  reductio ad absurdum  shows what is happening here.  The Loudounites don't care that their stadium wouldn't be any more accessible to those in Montgomery and PG Counties than Camden is.  Major League Baseball absolutely should be.  Here is a comlete list of MLB teams that drew one million fans or fewer in 2003:    That's right, none.  One million fans in this day and age would be a disgrace.  What Gabe Paul is suggesting would be an embarrassment to baseball and a monumental disservice to the Expos, who may as well stay in Montreal if they want anyone to watch them.    This is from the Times:  The revised vision of baseball in Virginia will go against a decade-long trend of urban-centered ballparks and build a new town center in which a ballpark is the centerpiece. That decade-long trend is probably the best thing to happen to baseball AND to cities in a long time.  I dearly hope MLB isn't as entranced by a free stadium as I'm afraid they are.  At a press conference, prospective team owner William Collins was bold in assessing how a team at the Dulles site would be marketed. And in a slight nod to the remoteness of the site, Collins said he didn't plan to market the team extensively to fans in the District, Montgomery and Prince George's counties and Southern Maryland.      "We've always looked south and west of the [Potomac]," Collins said. "Nothing has really changed there. In this area, you do not want to cross any bridges." Does this strike anyone as delusional?  One thing about major sports franchises - they like cities.  Some of them, like the NY football teams, may play in the suburbs, but at least profess to belong to a city.  These trifling bastards think they can have a purely suburban major league team.  Has that ever worked?  Has it ever happened at all?  There is no argument in favor of this that is not based on short-sighted greed and/or blatant self-interest.  Why would MLB do this, costing themselves millions of fans and a team in a large, wealthy urban center?  A free stadium.  Why would anyone in the area be in favor of this?  Well, if you live Loudoun County, you'll be able to get to the games in ten minutes, and the riff-raff on the other side of the river can go to Hell.  Well, it's time for our millionaires to get cracking and stand up to theirs.  Write to the  urlLink Washington Baseball Club  and tell them to get their act together.  Write to the papers.  Hell, write to your congressmen.  Some morons got Strom Thurmond to write a  urlLink letter  to get Joe Jackson into the Hall of Fame - get your representatives to start exerting some federal pressure on Bud Selig.  It's time to stand up.  Washington DC has a 1-0 record against Virginia, and we won't lose this one.   Further reading: Peter White has a better-written and far less vitriolic take at  urlLink All Baseball .  Off Wing Opinion has a  urlLink favorable read , as well as a media conspiracy I really hope is true.  Sorry about the swearing.

      The house library here at Distinguished Senators is a cavernous, musty place, full of the eldritch wisdom of the hoary ancients and some really awful LeCarre novels (anyone want a barely-touched copy of  Single & Single ?).  The latest addition to the treasury is the  urlLink  Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers  , which I just finished, more or less.  It's not really a book you finish, and perhaps that's why I'm left unsatisfied.  I consider myself a fan of both these authors.  While I have been finding Rob Neyer's ESPN columns kind of insipid (and certainly not worth paying for),   urlLink Baseball Dynasties   (on which he collaborated Eddie Epstein) keeps finding its way back to my nightstand.  Bill James' New Historical Baseball Abstract was pivotal in changing the way I looked at baseball, however much of a grouch the author may seem to be.  And in fact, neither man lets us down.  The book's best bits are the ten essays about pitchers who  a) pitched at least thirty years ago b) are not in the Hall of Fame c) have never been the subject of a book-length biography, but d) had careers of Hall of Fame caliber. It's a good idea coupled with good execution.  James especially is adept at giving the reader the feel for the era in which his subject played (though he's no Steven Goldman.  Keep plugging away, though, Bill!).  It's the rest of the book that left me less than amazed.  The lengthy discussions of the origins of the curveball, screwball, et al. were mildly interesting, but one can only spend so much time hearing back-and-forth forkball/splitter arguments.  James goes through and rates the top ten fastballs of each five years, which seems to serve little point other than to start arguments.  I'm leaving some things out, and that's intentional.  Fun stuff to browse through, but nothing that grabs.  It's a 484 page book, and nearly 400 of it contains the Pitcher Census.  This is a list of a whole buttload of pitchers, for each of whom is given a brief summary of stats and measurements, pitch selection, and notes.  Sources are described, players are consulted, controversies mentioned.  Some pitchers get longish essays (such as whether Jesse Haines was a fastball or curveball kind of guy), some get lengthy quotations from other sources, and some get just the minimum.  It's handy if you want to settle a bar bet about what pitches Dizzy Dean's brother threw (fastball, nickel curve - and what kind of bar do you hang out at, anyway?).    After the Census, James complains about Baseball Prospectus' Pitcher Abuse Points (he thinks they're a bunch of pap!  Ha ha!), and a couple BP guys respond.  They're kinda talking about different things, and no one calls anyone names, so don't flip right to the back to get to it or anything.  Then James messes around with some stuff I can't imagine anyone caring about (no one has ever gone 27-5!), though I guess the Cy Young prediction system has already started some arguments.  Blah blah.  Here's my problem: I bet this book was a lot more fun to research than it is to read.  The authors talk in the introduction about what a blast they had leafing through old magazines and scouting reports, and good for them.  The Census, though, is going to age fast - it already doesn't have any Zambranos.  Part III of the book is just James doing mental gymnastics with dinosaur stats (his fascination with Wins and Losses - possibly the most misleading stats in baseball - is a rant topic for another day), and I got tired of that with a quickness.  This review came out sounding more negative than I meant it to.  I don't regret buying the book, and the essays are great.  If I thought I was ever going to read the other 400 pages again, I'd feel like I got a little more value.  Caveat emptor.

      I saw the Smithsonian  urlLink Baseball as America  exhibit yesterday, and it was slamming, as the kids say.  They had John McGraw's wife's chair, Casey Stengel's 1964 All-Star ballot, and Three-Finger Brown's hand in a jar.  There was a special emphasis on baseball in DC, which I took as endorsement of the Cause I so fanatically serve.  Walter Johnson's glove was on display, as well as Buck Leonard's Grays jersey and scorecards from a really long time ago.  I wish I could be more specific, but I kind of shut that part of my brain off after I saw Jim Palmer's underwear ad.  Congratulations, Jim.  Your package has been immortalized in the Smithsonian.  Buffalo shots aside, it was nifty as all get-out, and you should see it before it pulls up stakes in October.  Perhaps the best part was the end, when you buy stuff.  No, I'm not trying to be all cynical about our plastic consumer society, man, I mean it.  If there's one thing I dig, it's dead baseball teams (my St. Louis Browns cap will attest to this).  Well, the gift shop had dead teams galore.  If this blogging gig paid better, I'd be wearing a $255 Senators jersey right now.  Or at least the $80 Grays one (something I just thought of - the Rangers still own the Senators name and all that.  Does Tom Hicks get the scrilla when they sell Senators stuff?).  There was a bunch of other old Negro League and major league hats and whatnot, but I only had eyes for the Senators stuff.  If I may direct your attention  urlLink here , they had the one at the bottom with the cursive W, but the one I got looks like the third one, except the back is blue.  This means I can represent 24-7, not only on the Internet, but also in the real world.  So if you see a devastatingly handsome fellow with beige hair and a Senators cap, holler at me.  Show some support for the Cause.  Suggest a new name to call Peter Angelos or another way to say that the Expos can't hit.   In other news, the Washington Post finally deigned to mention this city's life-or-death struggle to get the Expos.  I shouldn't complain; it was a fine piece.  Not good enough to link to, though - there's something about the Post's registration procedure that really gets to me.  If you have a physical copy of the paper, it's on the second page of the Sports section (the front page is taken up with tennis, golf, gymnastics, and soccer.  See why we need a baseball team?)  The best part is when George Solomon, the author, whom I should probably have mentioned earlier, quotes Fred Malek, head of the DC ownership group, as saying that this is the most optimistic he's been in five years.  That, combined with Angelos saying he's resigned to the advent of the Expos, makes me feel pretty good (my new hat helps, too).  I'm almost certainly getting ahead of myself, but at the moment I'm more concerned about Northern Virginia getting the new stadium than I am about the area getting a team at all.

      What happens when the worst offense in baseball meets the third-best pitching in the AL?  See the words of the immortal Bugs Bunny, above.  I was shocked when the 'Spos managed seven runs on Friday (though not shocked that they lost).  Imagine my reaction when I got home last night and saw a "12" next to "MON" in the fourth inning.  The Expos don't get to be on TV very often, even in Montreal, but thank goodness for WGN for letting us watch a wacky roller-coaster of a game.  Perhpaps in honor of Tim Raines, whose number was retired at L'Estade du Fromage, Juan Rivera "jacked" two "dingers" in an inning, the starters were both gone by the fifth, and Montreal had an inning in which they scored more runs than they had in any game so far.  The Expos didn't score in only one inning, the White Sox four.  Chad Cordero picked up the two-inning save (he gave up a run, though.  It was that kind of game), and Frank Robinson aged two years right there in the dugout.  It also marked the first time this die-hard Expos fan saw the team on TV.  Maybe I saw them on TBS a couple times, but that was before my overnight transformation into World's #1 Expos fan, so it doesn't count.  The only special insight I gleaned from the broadcast is this: Good Lord does Nick Johnson have an ugly moustache.  Jeff Kent looks at that thing and says, "Damn, that's a cheesy moustache."  He looks like he lost a bet.  I mean, Johnson isn't exactly Travis Lee to begin with, if you know what I mean, and having what looks like two anchovies attached to his lip doesn't help.  Well, at least they won't have to come up with anything new for  urlLink Nick Johnson Bobblehead Night .

      Since starting this blog, I've been trying to keep an eye out for other news on Washington baseball.  The Post doesn't seem to care much (who can blame them?  It's Mystics season!), but the Times has something every once in a while.  Today, there's a  urlLink column  by Dick Heller about . . . I don't know what.  Here are his points, as far as I can tell: 1) The Orioles are not good 2) The Senators were not good 3) Peter Angelos is not good I think that's what he's trying to say.  Really, it's two columns, casually joined in the middle, and there's something about Angelos dressed like Santa.  I don't know why I'm bothering, but here are bits that stuck in my craw:  On the O's 14-0 loss to Cleveland: " . . . the Indians' batch of banjo hitters scored the most runs by a Cleveland team in three years."  These banjo hitters are leading the American League in BA and OBP (did you know that?  I didn't).  They're seventh in SLG, third in BB, and - most importantly - first in runs.  They don't hit many homers (Sorry - "jack" that many "dingers" - I'm still gunning for that Sportscenter job), but homers are merely a means to an end, and that end is runs.  By the only measure that counts, Cleveland has the best offense in the league.  Buncha banjo hitters.  "Our own little club in Washington or Northern Virginia?"  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Screw Virginia.  "As presently constituted, the O's look like rummage sale refugees anyway."  This is unduly harsh.  Granted, the Baltimores are having a rough streak, and they sure can't pitch.  On the other hand, their lineup is one to be envied, recent scuffling aside.  Tejada is probably the league's best shortstop, now that A-Rod has moved left (from the hitter's perspective).  Palmeiro's power is down, but his batting eye is sharp, and I'm not going to make a Viagra joke.  Melvin Mora is beginning to convince us that he wasn't a fluke last year.  It's not unreasonable to expect Gibbons, Bigbie, Matos, and at least one of the second basemen to pick up the pace.  The pitching really is atrocious, though.  It seems like every time I turn on the O's, the announcer's lamenting that tonight's 25-year-old lefty has thrown 80 pitches by the fourth inning.  This team won't contend in the AL East and would have a hard time elsewhere.  But they're not - how do I put this? - they're not the Expos.  " . . . the reborn Washington Nationals taking the field in 2005 . . ."  It's like this guy hasn't even been reading the Name of the 'Spos.  Nationals is out, buddy.  The brutal irony of all this is that a completely pointless column in the Washington Times prompted another completely pointless column by me complaining about its pointlessness.   In other news, this blog is celebrating it's one-week anniversary, and I'm already out of ways to say the Expos can't hit.  Here's to another week!  UPDATE: I get done with this thing then go check the scores.  The Expos have 3 runs in 3 innings (with a Vidro "dinger"), and the Indians have none.  Distinguished Senators - where the irony never stops!  UPDATE II: There's a black fly in my Chardonnay!

      In my opinion,  urlLink this  has the finest subtitle of any third installment.  Plus it has Hulk Hogan.  But enough of this Gen-X irony and on to the issue at hand.  There has, apparently, been a movement to give the Expos the name of a Negro League team when they get here.  Grays is coming in second in the Washington Baseball Club poll, and . . . well, that's the only evidence I have.  Where these things get discussed is a mystery to me.  Maybe I should start reading Boswell.  The very term "Negro Leagues" is a misnomer.  Before (and slightly after) integration, teams started and folded, entered and left leagues, and barnstormed.  Black baseball in the 20s and 30s had more in common with the freewheeling atmosphere of white baseball in the 19th century than it did with the Major Leagues.   urlLink New Era , of all things, has an extremely hard-to-read list of Negro League teams over the years, and the sheer number of teams in the same few cities puts me in mind of the  urlLink American Association  or  urlLink National Association  - short league schedules, lots of barnstorming and franchise shifts.  Cleveland alone had seven Negro League teams.  Washington totaled five: Elite Giants, Potomacs, Pilots, Black Senators, and Grays.  Elite Giants is a fantastic name for a baseball team, but I'm sure the San Francisco Giants wouldn't approve, and pretty much every other town in the country had Elite Giants at some point.  Potomacs is an awful name.  Black Senators sounds like the Senators but with Jim Brown and Fred "The Hammer" Williamson.  Obviously, that's completely awesome, but can you picture  urlLink this guy  as a Black Senator?  Pilots reminds us of Bud Selig and the  urlLink worst caps  in the history of the sport.  That brings us to the Grays.  I'm not going to go deeply into the history of the Homestead Grays, but if you're curious check out  urlLink this  or  urlLink this .  The Grays were the dominant team of the Negro National League, winning nine straight pennants from 1937 to 1945.  They featured Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, and Cool Papa Bell, among others.  They are, along with the Kansas City Monarchs, the best remembered Negro League team.  They split their time (hell, they split their  weekends ) between Forbes Field in Pittsburgh and Griffith Stadium in DC.  If we're going with a Negro League name, Grays is the one.  So, why would we?  Look, I'm not equipped to discuss race, and I do it as little as possible.  It's kind of unavoidable here, though.  Suffice it to say that Washington is not known as Chocolate City because of its confections.  DC has long been a center of black American culture, and if any city is going to pay this tribute to the Negro Leagues, this one makes sense.  Personally, I find the Negro Leagues about as interesting as the old Pacific Coast League - pretty interesting, but not overwhelmingly so.  In fact, this comparison works pretty well: the Angels are named after a PCL team, so why not have the Grays?  While I don't think modern organized baseball needs to beat itself over the head for all eternity out of guilt over segregation, this would be a nice gesture.  And get a load of this: Washington, historically, is an awful place for baseball.  The original Senators won about 46.5% of their games.  Version 2 did even worse, about 41.8%.  In fact, all the Washington teams from the American League, National League, National Association, and Union Association have a combined record of 5506-6887, 44.4%.  I'm not enough of an operator with my pocket calculator to do this for everyone else, but DC might well claim the title in this unfortunate category.  In 60 years, the Senators managed three pennants and only one title.  I think it's safe to say that Washington has the worst record of any of the eleven cities hosting NL or AL teams in 1901, the start of fifty-some year period of stability.  The St. Louis Browns were probably the worst of the 16 teams (only one pennant in fifty years, and that was during the war, when players averaged 38.6 years of age and 1.95 arms each), but St. Louis had the Cards to fall back on.  Philadelphia had a disproportionate number of the very worst teams, but the A's also fielded some of the best.  The Homestead Grays appear to be the only successful thing ever associated with baseball in Washington, which can only be another mark in the name's favor.  Senators is still my top choice, but I would be very nearly as pleased with the Washington Grays.  Next time, in the last installment of The Name of the 'Spos, we'll take a look at some dark horses and also-rans.  Mainly it'll be an excuse to talk about the Warriors, I think.

      Sorry for busting out that tired Electric Boogaloo joke again.  It's a compulsion.  Last time, we had a look at the most obvious name for a DC team, and I proved conclusively that Senators is the only choice.  In fact, I probably should have saved that for last, since there seems to be little point in bothering with the rest of the ideas.  I shall continue nonetheless, but don't expect anything interesting.   urlLink Baseball Reference  informs us that the Senators were officially the Nationals for fifty years.  I don't know why, and I don't particularly care.  No one used it anyway.  The name is just as dry and traditional as the Senators, but without the resonance.  Ask your average baseball fan who Walter Johnson played for, and he'll say "who?"  Ask someone who's read   urlLink The Glory of Their Times   (which is as good as everyone says it is), and he'll say "the Senators."  He won't say "the Nationals."  The Senators v. 2 didn't bother with it, and neither should we.   urlLink Baseball in DC  has a poll asking for your choice for the name of the 'Spos.  At the moment, Senators is leading, followed by Grays and Monuments.  I'll tackle the Grays another day, but where are people getting Monuments?  I've never heard of a team with that name, and I hope I never do.  I would approve of this name in one impossible circumstance: a colleague of mine had the idea to build a ballpark on the Mall, with the Washington Monument serving as a foul pole (Hi, George).  The impractability of this idea detracts not at all from its brilliance.  A team playing this park could be called nothing but the Monuments.  Otherwise, forget it.  There are two traditional names that have not come up in any discussion I'm aware of, and I present them here only to show off my erudition (by which I mean my ability to surf around on Baseball Reference).  There have been  urlLink two   urlLink teams  known at one time or another as the Statesmen.  As far as really Washingtony names go, it's better than the Monuments, but I can't think of a good reason to prefer it to Senators. 1873 saw a National Association team called the Blue Legs in Washington (no doubt over the objections of the owner of the  urlLink Baltimore Canaries ).  People back then were incapable of coming up with totally rad names like the  urlLink Voodoo  or the  urlLink Burn , so they mainly just named teams after what color their socks were.  Hence the Red Sox, White Sox, Reds, Cardinals, and Browns.  That worked out fine, but calling a new team the Blue Legs would be akin to me saying something like, "the New York Hilltoppers clouted prodigious circuit blows in the World's Series of Base Ball, to the delight of the bugs in the stands."  That kind of thing can be cute for a while, but before you know it you're growing a handlebar moustache and listening to ragtime.  Next time I'll take on some Negro League names.  This is going to be tough - so far I haven't been doing much but reciting what I dig up on Baseball Reference, which doesn't have Negro League teams.  I hope my extensive research (a couple hours at a Barnes and Noble) has provided me with enough information on this topic.

       urlLink Senators and Sabermetrics  has more Angelos hatred for you.  I don't agree with all of it (I don't miss Jason Johnson or Pat Hentgen), but this is interesting: "The Orioles spend less than 50% of revenue on player payroll, the lowest in the majors."  I did not know that. My experience with Baltimoreans is that they're serious about baseball and love their team.  They certainly deserve better than this.

       . . . says the owner of the 27-32 O's, who got  urlLink served  14-0 today by the Indians.  Angelos is right, of course; the Orioles are well on their way to an historical seventh consecutive 4th place finish, and the last thing we need is some competition ruining the streak.

      Well, that was embarrassing.  In three games, the Expos could muster one run.  To paraphase Bob Uecker, ONE GODDAMN RUN?!  At least this was expected - everyone knows the 'Spos couldn't hit a beach ball with a cricket bat.  But, the thinking goes, at least the pitching's pretty good.  Well, not this weekend.  Livan Hernandez was impressive, taking a complete-game loss in the first contest, but Vargas 'n' Armas combined for seven earned runs in six innings total against another offense reminiscent of the deadball era. It was nice of the Expos to let the Mariners have a little fun for once.  By the way, if you ever want to make a Seattle fan cry, just ask him how the  urlLink Carlos Guillen  trade worked out.

      This blog does not exist merely to call Peter Angelos names and mock the Expos' lack of batting prowess (10 shut-outs and counting!).  I hope in addition to offer constructive discussion of various issues facing a DC baseball club.  The one that has most grabbed my interest (because it requires no actual knowledge) is that of the team's name.  Quite a few have been suggested, and I hate almost all of them.  Let's have a look, keeping in mind that some have been suggested by no one but me: Senators Nationals Grays Monuments Expos Sexpos Black Senators Potomacs Statesmen Furies  (NB. There is an unfortunate tendency to resort to the most hackneyed, Capitol Steps-esque gags when this topic arises.  I'm not going to waste time talking about such knee-slapping entries as the Lobbyists, Those Fat-Cats in Washington, or the Gob-Stuffed Interns.  Unless I just did.  Damn.)  Consider the name of this blog an endorsement of the Senators.  "Senators" has a long, delicious tradition, from the 1901 squad, led by  urlLink Boileryard "William" Clarke  to a sixth-place finish, to the 1971 version, led to by Ted Williams to a fifth-place finish.  In between, the Senators played spoiler to any number of great teams.  In 1927, they gave the doughty Murder's Row Yankees a run for their money, coming close to almost winning nearly half their games against the Bombers.  1954 saw the Washington club contribute only 18 of the Indians' record 111 wins. Just as the Indians have  Major League  (greatest baseball movie ever made, so stick that in your pipe and smoke it, Costner), the Senators have  Damn Yankees , a musical so awesome that is has a  urlLink butt-rock supergroup  named after it.  It would be foolish to throw away all this history.  Plus, check out  urlLink these sweet caps ! By naming the team the Senators, we'll be upholding a time-honored and nifty baseball tradition.  Look at the Orioles, for instance (well, not today.   urlLink Ponson's  pitching).  All told, there have been  urlLink five versions  of the Baltimore Orioles, one which went on to become the Yankees, proving that irony is more powerful than love.  When the unlamented St. Louis Browns moved east in 1954, they took the traditional name of their home.  A similar dynamic gave us the Brewers (the first Brewers are now the Orioles.  It's like the  urlLink Julio-Claudian family tree  up in here), the Angels (an old PCL team), and the Marlins (a minor league team). So, in conclusion, there is a right answer to this question, and it's Senators.  Anything else would make Walter Johnson roll over in his grave (reportedly located on the grounds of a  urlLink suburban high school ), and make me change the name of the blog. Next time we'll have a look at some of the other ideas, including the ones I just made up.

      From the  urlLink Times :  Angelos yesterday told the Associated Press he will grudgingly accept the relocation of the Montreal Expos to the Washington area.  That's real big of him, especially considering that he has no right to keep a National League team out of DC.  The article goes on to say that he'd focus on the curtailment of his broadcast range to challenge the move.  But now even he admits that it's inevitable, and his poor Orioles will be stuck being the home team for only one major metropolitan area.  Poor baby.

      When I'm looking for a game recap, I don't go to ESPN or Sportsline or any of that.  It's just too easy, and I like a little challenge.  So I go  urlLink here .  Let's see what they have to say about last night's exercise in batting futility:  One to Mariners 0 Expos <> 11-day <> Seattle, the SEFUKO field   the Mariners -- 9 times death [ 2 ] bases-loaded -- catcher bow DAZU of 41 years old -- 左前打(ing) -- good-bye -- a victory It has been the score for the first time in 30 innings since 5 times of the Astros game on the 7th. Double play, home base 憤死, check death, etc. were the games of an ineffective offensive continuation.     And what of Tomo Ohka, you ask?   urlLink A landlord is to entering a disabled list and a 12-day operation.   it was announced on the 11th that Expos put pitcher Tomokazu Oya (28) who broke the 右手橈 (obtaining) bone into the disabled list for 15 days An operation will be undergone by State Mel Bohn of Florida on the morning of the 12th.   The landlord left the mound in response to the hit ball of a belt run on the 10th to the right hand in the Royals game in Missouri Kansas City.     Anyone who can figure out why Ohka's a "landlord" gets mad props, as the kids say.  UPDATE! Andrew the anonymous gorilla explains in the comments sections why he (Ohka, not Andrew) is called a landlord AND why they call him Oya.  Big props.   urlLink Here's  a site that describes my respect.

      My man Pedro, who now uses "BAVASI!" as a grave imprecation, has a  urlLink preview  of the much-anticipated Expos/Mariners match-up.  It's tough to get too worked up about a series between a couple teams who'd have a hard time scoring ten runs off a t-ball stand.  Ah well.   C'est la vie , as the Expos fans say.

       urlLink Off-Wing Opinion  has some comments on a Post article slapping down Northern Virginia's bid for the Expos (I'd link to the article itself, but I don't feel like registering). I live in Silver Spring and work in Alexandria and am well acquainted with both sides of the divide.  That said, screw Virginia.  I try to be reasonable about this, but inevitably find myself shouting things like, "Hey, who won the war, jackass?!"  So just put it smack in the middle with a Metro stop next door, and no one gets hurt.  Thanks to Pedro for the link.

      I'm not doing this because I want to.  The Expos are not a good team, and every time they get shut out (eight times and counting!), I am reminded that even if they do come to DC, they will have done so too late to keep Vlad Guerrero. Furthermore, I know next to nothing about them and have no idea what I'm talking about.  But I guess that's just one of things you have to overcome if you want to be a powerhouse blogger.  So, here goes: The scalpers had the day off yesterday as the Expos were in Kansas City for a double header.  Montreal's finest swept the luckless Royals as Nick Johnson, this blog's favorite Expo and third favorite living American, knocked 3 hits in 5 attempts, along with one of his trademark walks.  Young Zach Day was the hero of game one, scattering six hits in a complete game shut-out.  Tony "the Baptist" Batista, last seen striking out 400 times as an Oriole, hit two home runs off the hilariously named Jimmy Gobble to lead the 'Spos to a 7-2 victory in the nightcap. The wins brought the Expos all the way up to 20-38, and now the club has an opportunity to battle it out with the Bavasified Mariners (22-36) for the worst record in the major leagues.

      I was going to wait until the All-Star Break to start this, if only to defend myself from heartbreak.  But then I started thinking for a change: We all know blogs are the most important thing in the world right now.  Andrew Sullivan tells us this almost every day.  I don't know what kind of people are on the MLB relocation committee, but I do know that I don't have the money or the looks to influence them.  What I can do, though, is make my case for the Montreal Expos, a once proud franchise reduced to playing in front of 2000 people in L'Estade du Fromage or whatever they call it, to move to Washington, DC.  To do this, I am going to outblog the navvies in Norfolk, the hemp-wearers in Portland, the legitimate businessmen in Vegas, and even Monterrey's  blogonistas  until MLB comes to its senses (it's happened before - remember the spider webs on the bases?) and sends the Expos to RFK Stadium.  Now down to the nuts and the bolts.  Obviously, it's not easy to blog about a team that doesn't exist now and hasn't for over thirty years, so I can't promise to stay on topic.  At the moment, my baseball attention is divided numerous ways.  I am, first and foremost, a Cardinals fan.  I get the Orioles on the TV and radio, and am engaged to an O's fan.  And with the fateful announcement approaching, my interest in the forlorn, vagabond Expos grows.  I think there should be enough material in all that to keep me busy until the Senators v.3 debut.

      Our old friend Hal Bodley of USA Today (the official rag of the  urlLink Loudoun Cabal ) was at it again today.&nbsp; I have  urlLink proven conclusively  that Bodley is biased toward NoVa, ignorant, or both, but, in the absence of news,&nbsp;it can't hurt to revisit some old themes.  Professor Bodley held a  urlLink chat  this afternoon, and here are a couple of the bits that pertain to us, repeated out of order for dramatic effect:  StevenJB Olney, MD: Thank you for taking my question, Hal. I'm starting to worry that Washington's inability to enact stadium financing is really an indicator that they are bluffing MLB and that they don't have the financial wherewithal to finance 100% of the cost of a stadium in DC. Do you feel the same way?   Hal Bodley: I think the relocation committee believes the financing in Washington is sound. I might be wrong, but that's what I'm hearing. In fact, the committee is split on whether the site should be downtown or at Dulles.  If even Hammerin' Hal is admitting that DC's finances are good, we must be in fine shape.&nbsp; Particularly if there's any truth to that  urlLink Post story  saying that the Loudounites are, in the words of Redman, Champagne hos with Kool-Aid money.  Arlington, VA: How strong a case do you think D.C. baseball needs to make to convince owners that it is in MLB's best interest to award the Expos to them? It seems to me that a D.C. team would make more money than a Loudoun County team since it would be accessible to many more people. Do you expect the owners to be convinced that outweighs the concerns of Angelos?   Hal Bodley: No. My guess is Loudoun County is No. 1 on the list because putting the Expos there is a compromise for Angelos. Like it or not, Commissioner Bud Selig doesn't want to get into a battle with Angelos. Selig has a lot of problems with weakening the Orioles by putting a team in Washington. Believe it or not, that's the way he feels. He'll probably try to convince Angelos the site near Dulles is far enough away. But, as we know, the Expos will have to play in RFK for three years.....  Here we go again.&nbsp; Look, Peter Angelos has not been reticent in this matter.&nbsp; He's had ample opportunity to beg Selig in public&nbsp;to put the Expos in NoVa, and there's no reason to think he wouldn't; he's not exactly known for keeping his mouth shut.&nbsp; To my knowledge, Angelos has  never  drawn any distinction between the goal of the Washington Baseball Club and that of the Evil Virginia Baseball Club.&nbsp; Both cost him his massive broadcasting monopoly, worth far more money than the fans he gets to drive to Balitmore to watch the O's lose.&nbsp; In fact, Angelos DID come out in favor of a bid: San Juan's.&nbsp; But the Loudounites are so desperate for some advantage over DC that they're clinging to the non-existent whim of the Baltimore Rat-Creature.&nbsp; Good luck with that, fellas.

      Seriously.&nbsp; There's nothing going on.&nbsp; Nothing on how the Loudoun Cabal ( urlLink artist's conception )&nbsp;has downgraded from " urlLink Scenic Diamond Lake Stadium " to " urlLink Scenic Diamond Gravel Pit Stadium ."&nbsp; Nothing about the Expos' MLBPA reps being told to pack for Washington.&nbsp; I've already talked about Angelos' bitter rantings (a good sign!).&nbsp; Here's some scrounging:    I'm so confident  that I'm paying a little attention to the Expos again.&nbsp; Peter Gammons  urlLink says  that they're not going to trade Brad Wilkerson or Luis Ayala, but Orlando Cabrera is on his way out.&nbsp; I approve.    There's a show &nbsp;on  urlLink 1450 WOL  here in the DC area that occasionally discusses the DC baseball issue.&nbsp; Sports Groove, hosted by Mark Gray, is on from 7-10 pm on weekdays, and the host is proponent of  urlLink remembering the Grays .    Why I Hate DC  is as  urlLink annoyed  with Angelos as the rest of us.    Like I said,  nothing.    UPDATE!  I totally forgot about this one thing I was saving for a rainy day when I had nothing to talk about (i.e., today).&nbsp; Bisnow.com, responsible for some of talk radio's most annoying ads, has an with interview William L. Collins of the Evil Virginia Baseball Club (EVBC).&nbsp; Get out your BS detectors and check out the  urlLink summary .  > new names for the team could be the Virginia Senators, Nationals, Presidents, Generals, Graysox, or Stallions Ripoff, Ripoff, Lame, You Idiots Really Miss the Confederacy Don't You?, Lame, Gay.  > it won't be so hard to get to a Dulles stadium on weeknights, because games would start at 730 PM, at the tail end of rush hour when people have already left work in DC to homes that are closer to the stadium Uh-huh.&nbsp; It would be even easier if the stadium were in a city.&nbsp; You know, like all the rest of them.  > there are two million residents within a 20 mile radius of the Dulles site, including the fastest growing area in the country And if every single one of them goes to a game, you might outdraw the Brewers.  > fans will come in "droves" from D.C., Montgomery County, Virginia, and West Virginia I haven't listened to the interview, so I don't know if he giggled when he said this.&nbsp; I do like the skeptical quotation marks around "droves."&nbsp; Your bid might be in trouble if you're relying on West Virginia.  > the Dulles site will satisfy concerns of Peter Angelos because it is a two-hour drive from Baltimore Utter bullcrap.&nbsp; The Loudounites just love to bring this up in spite of the fact that it makes no sense.   I dearly hope this is the same spiel he gave MLB.&nbsp; If it is, we have nothing to worry about.

      My shot at ESPN yesterday was perhaps premature, because they really deserve it today.&nbsp; Check out this  urlLink piece o' jackassery  from Tom Friend of ESPN the Magazine (like SI, but with more "Boo-yas!").   I yield to very few  in the loathing Peter Angelos category.&nbsp; I think at one point I called him a "rat-creature," in fact.&nbsp; But Friend, in damning the man trying to keep the Expos from their proper home, manages to insult an entire city.   When I was growing up in Washington, D.C. during the late '60s-early '70s, my folks would drive us through Baltimore on our way to New York City.   And I'd hold my nose.   I don't know if it was the factories or the smoke stacks or the Chesapeake Bay, but Baltimore literally smelled back then. And, based on what I'm hearing now, it still smells.  I've been to Baltimore many a time, and the only smell I've ever noticed is that of  urlLink Old Bay , which they put on everything.&nbsp; Seriously, this is just childish.    Any time now, Major League Baseball will announce the fate of the Montreal Expos, and more and more it looks like they'll be coming to my hometown ... unless Baltimore throws a hissy fit. He's quite right here, except that he misses one vital distinction.&nbsp; Baltimore is not trying to keep out the Expos.&nbsp; Angelos is.&nbsp; Hell, the mayor of Baltimore  urlLink came out in favor of a DC team , for which he was personally insulted by Angelos.   Friend goes on to snipe about powerhouse O's teams of the 70s not drawing well, the Bullets leaving, and the Colts sneaking out.&nbsp; All of this is completely irrelevant and shamefully inflammatory.    Baltimore can't support one team. Trust me, Baltimore is not a great sports town, never has been. This is obviously nonsense.A quick breeze through  urlLink Baseball Reference's  yearly league summaries shows that Baltimore is, in fact, an absolutely first-class baseball town.&nbsp; From 1995 to 1998, the Orioles led the American League in attendance each year.&nbsp; In '95, they came in third in their division with an uninspiring 71-73 record, but still drew over 3 million fans.&nbsp; In fact, in those four years, they came in first place only once but still outdrew all competition.   1998 was the first of the Orioles' six (and counting) fourth-place finishes, yet the O's managed to sell over 3.6 million tickets.&nbsp; The next two years featured crappy teams and in excess of 3 million through the turnstiles, good for second in the AL both years.&nbsp; It wasn't until 2002 that attendance dipped below 3 million, but the Orioles since 1995 have never been worse than fifth in a league of 14 teams.&nbsp; Considering the kind of teams they've been fielding in that time, this is a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the enthusiam and loyalty of Baltimore baseball fans.  There is nothing to be gained from insulting Baltimore and her inhabitants, and I'm not just saying that because I'm something less than a year from becoming a Baltimorean-in-law.&nbsp; The fine people of Charm City hate Angelos just as much as we do, so why is Friend going out of his way to make enemies?&nbsp; This column is emblematic of an aspect of sports journalism I find particularly distasteful: controversy generates interest, so above all generate controversy. I'm sure Friend knows full well that the O's are a well-supported team, but that didn't fit his insulting thesis, so he chose to focus on the 1970s.&nbsp; This makes him no better than the lowest message board troll, and ESPN should be ashamed of itself for running this piece of brainless vitriol.

      There are teams other than the Yankees and Red Sox, you bastards.    Peter Angelos  has given up, if  urlLink this interview  is any indication.  "There are no real baseball fans in D.C." Angelos says the fans are mainly in the Maryland suburbs, and those pushing for a D.C. or     Northern Virginia     team are trying to steal Orioles' fans (emphases mine). At this point, he's done trying to convince and is now just bitching.&nbsp; I'd love to hear a response from Mayor Williams.    I'm the first to admit  that this kind of thing is over my head, but the Post has a  urlLink story  today that questions the Loudoun Cabal's&nbsp;( urlLink artist's conception )&nbsp;ability to build that little Stepford town around the proposed ballpark.  The problem is, the baseball backers don't own most of the land. Tax records and interviews with owners who control the majority of the property indicate that the developers have agreements to buy, at most, only about a third of it. It appears that they have enough land to build the park, but perhaps not enough for the Bed, Bath, & Beyond and the Romano's Macaroni Grill that were to surround it.  Such an eventuality would mark a stunning rollback from the vision Paul and his fellow baseball boosters offered Major League Baseball executives in May. Not that the DC plan is all beer and Skittles, either.  The District, too, faces challenges in putting together the real estate for a stadium. Although the city controls Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium and a second site is owned by the National Park Service, the remaining two sites are privately owned. Anyway, read the whole thing if you're interested.&nbsp; I started dozing off halfway through.    The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  ran a  urlLink story  about the effort to the name a DC team the Grays.&nbsp; Christopher Rehling, the huge throbbing brain behind  urlLink Remember the Grays , continues his takeover of the print media.&nbsp; Go read the story and get yourselves some historical perspective, suckers.    &nbsp;   Sunday's when all the papers  do their "Around the League" thing, so why shouldn't I?&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I'll even bold all the names, so it looks professional.     Barry Bonds  is going to get screwed out the MVP this year, no diggity.&nbsp;  Scott Rolen  is about to find himself in the right place at the right time,  urlLink  Miggy T  style .   Jason Schmidt  is a pretty good candidate for the  Cy Young .&nbsp; If he wins, Bonds proves me wrong and takes the MVP, and the Giants miss the playoffs, would that be the first time that had happened?&nbsp; Prolly.  If MLB is serious about speeding up the game, they should have a  lockerroom attendant  plant some betting slips in  Steve Trachsel's  stuff.   Josh Towers  is  urlLink putting a little something together  in Toronto.&nbsp; He came up with the Orioles in 2001, when they were fielding  Cal Ripken and the AAA All-Stars , and started out pretty hot.&nbsp; Then he started getting shelled and injured, but I always rooted for him.&nbsp; I was watching a spring training game once and the  announcers  were talking to him about wrestling.&nbsp; He was relieved that  Hulk Hogan  had recently become a good guy again.  The   urlLink Yankees of Baseball   are up 10 on the Cubs again.   Enjoy the four hours left of your weekend (eastern time zone only).

      No news on the Stark story since MLB said it wasn't true.&nbsp; I figure Stark got a mixture of what the MLB guys actually said and lockerroom scuttlebutt (Nick Johnson is the father of lies!).   The Mayor  said something that could might the situation pretty interesting.&nbsp; In  urlLink this story  in the Times, he is quoted as saying "[A lease] has to be negotiated, but you can't just presume," Williams said on WMAL (AM-630). "I don't know why everybody ... you know, this is how everybody just runs around, runs over the District. How could Northern Virginia just presume that they're going to play in RFK?" Wow, that's spiteful.&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; If I could vote for this guy, I totally would, in spite of the bowties.   Angelos has been taking  to the airwaves of late,  urlLink whining  that a team in DC (or NoVa, so don't get any ideas) would doom the Orioles to mediocrity.&nbsp; I don't know how he can say that with a straight face.&nbsp; Fourth place SIX TIMES IN A ROW!&nbsp; But no, the Senators would put them in fifth.  Let me make this clear, though: There is no doubt in my mind that the Grays (equal time!) would hurt the Orioles.&nbsp; The attendance is not a problem; Baltimore is a good baseball town, and a good team would have no trouble selling out Camden night after night.&nbsp; The loss of the broadcast monopoly really would cost Angelos, though.&nbsp; But what right does he have to that monopoly to begin with?&nbsp; If my employer accidentally gives me two paychecks every two weeks, I can't complain when they figure it out and start paying me my actual salary.&nbsp; The Orioles get two cities because of an historical accident - DC and Baltimore are not Dallas and Ft. Worth or Minneapolis and St. Paul.  Back in the day, before baseball teams wised up and started moving, the Cardinals, carried on the mighty KMOX, had a broadcast monopoly that encompassed pretty much everything west and south of St. Louis.&nbsp; However, this fact didn't stop a team from coming to Kansas City, let alone California and Texas.&nbsp; In the same way, the fact that DC happens to lack a baseball team at the moment does not mean that we're a permanent part of Angelos' fief.   Moving on,   urlLink Remember the Grays  has updated, and you should go gaze upon it.&nbsp; Especially the  urlLink news section,  in which I am flattered beyond anything I deserve.&nbsp; There's also a  urlLink list  of ten things you can do to help the cause.&nbsp; I have been informed that the RTG team of highly-trained operatives will be at  urlLink Screen on the Green  this Monday spreading the word, so look out if you're there.    urlLink The Washington Baseball Club   hasn't had anything new for a while with the exception of the opportunity to sign up for season tickets.&nbsp; I haven't filled out the form, so I don't know if they want any money yet.&nbsp; Go ahead and check it out if you feel lucky.   I threw up a link  to the baseball team of my beloved alma mater, Baylor University (motto: "The Wake Forest of Central Texas").&nbsp; There's no real reason for it; I don't follow Baylor baseball, although I do root for  urlLink Kip Wells and Jason Jennings .&nbsp; I don't expect you, my dear reader(s), to be amused or enlightened by following the link.&nbsp; I guess I just feel the need to represent.&nbsp; SIC 'EM, BEARS!

      I was scrambling all day to come up with some half-assed miscellany, then  urlLink this  pops up:   Expos players were told this week that a decision on their 2005 home is near, that it won't be Montreal and that there is a strong likelihood they will be living in the Washington, D.C., area. But wait, it gets better.   The player reps were informed by the union that there is now an overwhelming probability that they will wind up in either Washington or Northern Virginia -- although there is still a small chance that baseball could opt for Las Vegas.  The players now believe Washington is the favorite, with Northern Virginia looming as a compromise choice if Orioles owner Peter Angelos attempts to block Washington's bid. Either way, the players were told that the union is very confident this is, finally, their last year in Montreal. This is big stuff; it confirms what we've all been sensing for a while now.&nbsp; The Expos will almost certainly be somewhere 'round here next year.&nbsp; Now it's down to DC or NoVa.   They also came away with the impression that San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the Expos have been playing some home games, and Monterrey, Mexico, also are no longer being seriously considered.  Relocation candidates such as Portland, Ore., and Norfolk, Va., were pictured as being extremely unlikely. I feel bad for Norfolk.&nbsp; They had sorta funny commercials and everything, but were thwarted by simply not being a major league city.&nbsp; That's not stopping the Loudoun Cabal, but still.    If I may backtrack,  and I certainly may, let's have a closer look at this bit:   The players now believe Washington is the favorite, with Northern Virginia looming as a compromise choice if Orioles owner Peter Angelos attempts to block Washington's bid. Peter Angelos  cannot  block the Expos&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;DC.&nbsp; His territorial rights allow him to lord over this whole area in the  American League only .&nbsp; If he does try to block the Senators/Grays/whatever, it will have to be with under-the-table shenanigans (that being the technical legal term), and I find it hard to believe that MLB would allow DC relocation to get this far while Angelos still has a leg to stand on.   Furthermore, and I know I say this all the time, there is  still  no reason to believe that Angelos will support the NoVa bid.&nbsp; Angelos paid for some studies that say the Senators would cost the O's about 1,000 fans a game.&nbsp; He knows just as well as I do that he could have those fans back in a snap via the simple solution of fielding an above-.500 team.&nbsp; What he can't get back by not sucking is the television monopoly he now wields.&nbsp; Hence, he's all about Puerto Rico, making him the only person outside Puerto Rico of whom this is true.    Stop the Presses!  &nbsp;  I   must give props to DCFan01 over at the  urlLink message board , even if he is wrong about everything.&nbsp; He's all over this business like the Cards on LaTroy Hawkins, coming up with  urlLink this response  from MLB:   Major League Baseball players' union officials today denied reports on ESPN that they told some Montreal Expos players during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday that they will likely be playing in the Washington, D.C., area next year.  "What we essentially told them is that we have reason to expect Major League Baseball will make a decision, hopefully by the owners' meeting in a few weeks . . . and that a number of places are on the list," said MLB Players Association Executive Director Donald Fehr. "Nobody gave them assurances that they will be going to any location as opposed to anyplace else. People can make their own judgments on that, but we didn't make it for them." . . . MLB President Bob DuPuy called the report that the Expos will be playing on the Washington area next year "preposterous, not true."  "Apparently, union representatives offered their opinion of what might happen," said DuPuy in an e-mail. "It carries no imprimatur. No decision has been made and no recommendation has been made to the commissioner. Uninformed comments like this do not move the process along." So now the question is, whom do we believe?&nbsp; The short answer is "not DuPuy," but Fehr's presence makes this rebuttal a little harder to dismiss.&nbsp; Whatever actually transpired, Brad Wilkerson or somebody thinks they're going to DC.   Developing . . .

      There's nothing going on, but that's not going to stop me from bringing the content.&nbsp; I want to assure each and every one (both) of you who read this thing that you get what you pay for.  &nbsp;   Go take a look  at  urlLink this article  by Dick "What the" Heller in the Washington Times.&nbsp; Heller hates Sports Illustrated because they dissed the District.&nbsp; I hate SI because of Rick Reilly, but as long as we come to the same conclusion, right?&nbsp; Anyway, Heller contends that DC's finest sports moment was the 1924 World Series, as opposed to some Redskins crap I can't be bothered with.&nbsp; Don't read the article unless you want to have the Post's  urlLink daily feature  on the '24 Nats spoiled for you.  &nbsp;   Speaking of the 1924 Senators , there's a rather amusing post  urlLink right here &nbsp;from the relentless blast of positivity that is Why I Hate DC.  &nbsp;   I don't mention it often  because I try to keep things on point around here, but I am a Cardinals fan ( urlLink here's  a picture of me).&nbsp; I shall continue to be one until the Expos move to DC.&nbsp; In the event that they move to Herndon or whatever, I'll be a Cardinals fan as well as a Braves/Mets/Marlins/Phillies fan.&nbsp; Anyway, anyone who thought the Cards would have the best record in baseball at this point, raise your hand.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now put your hands down, you damn liars.&nbsp; I highly recommend checking in with  urlLink Redbird Nation  to keep up with a team I've started calling the Yankees of Baseball.  &nbsp;   Finally,  reader Vincent has a suggestion for Fred Malek and the DC ownership group:  Saw in the Post today that WUSA declined to renew Frank Herzog's contract. (Not a good year for him, alas.) But since Herzog is synonymous with Washington sports -- voice of the Redskins' three Super Bowl champions, plus the radio voice of the Bullets when they won the NBA title in 1977-78 -- I think Fred Malek would score huge PR points if he announced he will hire Herzog on the broadcast team in some capacity if the D.C. group gets the Expos.  What do you think?  &nbsp;   Well, it was only one Bermanism. &nbsp; Count yourself lucky.

      That's the feeling of momentum, dear reader(s).&nbsp; Something's about to happen, and there's a decent chance that it's going to be good.&nbsp; In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and predict right here that the Expos will wind up in DC or Northern Virginia.&nbsp; The problem is that from my standpoint, that's the difference between being patted on the head and clocked with a shovel. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sunday saw two columns, both by guys named Fisher, in the local papers.&nbsp; It's more of the usual conjecture, but I aim for thoroughness.&nbsp; From the  urlLink Times' Fisher :    One high-ranking MLB executive was overheard during the All-Star break saying residents in Herndon would need to start preparing for noise from a nearby ballpark. But MLB sources say at least one key member of the relocation committee is dead set against Northern Virginia's plan to build a ballpark near Dulles International Airport, believing the site is far too remote from central Washington to support a team during competitively lean years.    The second guy's right.&nbsp; The Virginia Monologues are not going to be a very good team upon their theoretical arrival.&nbsp; What happens when the novelty wears off, the Metro isn't extended, and the ownership has managed to stir up enough ill-will among non-Virginians to make us all Orioles fans?&nbsp; Gabe Paul's smug assertion that they'd be happy with a million fans would look amazingly prescient, that's what. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  And I forgot to mention that before the Expos have the honor of becoming just another attraction in the stripmall (between the Barnes and Noble and the paint-your-own-mug place), they have to spend a few years at RFK Stadium.&nbsp; Now, the Loudounites have made it clear that they have no interest in journeying to our nation's capital to see a game, so I'm sure not too many of them will be checking out the action at RFK.&nbsp; We DC and suburban MD residents may be starved for baseball, but the prospect of having the team stolen from us in three years would have to serve as a damper on attendance.&nbsp; So we have team ownership with poor attendance in a sub-optimal stadium, a new stadium to build, and probably a big ol' payment to get Angelos to finally shut the hell up.&nbsp; Put all those things together and you get a team that's not going to spend any money for a good long time.&nbsp; Have fun in last place, Loudoun. &nbsp;  &nbsp;   The   urlLink  Post's Fisher   has an even-handed DC vs. Loudoun analysis, as he's more interested in arguing for the area against Norfolk or Vegas or wherever.&nbsp; There's some pretty interesting demographic data in there, in case you run into anyone making some kind of asinine argument about how DC shouldn't get a team because the Senators left thirty years ago.&nbsp; Fisher also talks to my man Christopher Rehling, the mysterious genius behind  urlLink Remember the Grays , so go check out the Post article and the Grays site, which even got itself a  urlLink link on the Primer .  &nbsp;  Rehling also hipped me to  urlLink this message board , where the elite meet to take VA vs. DC cheapshots at one another.&nbsp; So get over there and start yelling at some Loudounites.

       . . .  urlLink in favor  of moving the Expos to DC. Citing historic, sentimental and cultural ties to baseball in the nation's capital, the Montgomery County Council threw its symbolic support behind Northern Virginia's rival and unanimously called on major league executives to return a team to the District. They faxed their resolution to baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, who was in Houston for last night's All-Star Game. And here's an interesting fact I actually did know: Council member Howard A. Denis (R-Potomac-Bethesda), who sponsored the measure, cited the memory of Washington Senators Hall of Fame pitcher Walter "Big Train" Johnson, who served two terms on the Montgomery County Commission, the forerunner of the council, as an example of the area's kinship to the game. Any time you can call on the memory of the Big Train, you score points with me.  Kudos, Howard A. Denis.  Anyway, here's where it starts getting snippy. "There seemed to be an undercurrent of negative feeling towards the nation's capital," said Denis, who said he could not recall any examples. "They seemed to feel that they didn't want us and didn't want us to come there. That hit me the wrong way." I'll give you an example, Howie.  Remember  urlLink this ? At a press conference, prospective team owner William Collins was bold in assessing how a team at the Dulles site would be marketed. And in a slight nod to the remoteness of the site, Collins said he didn't plan to market the team extensively to fans in the District, Montgomery and Prince George's counties and Southern Maryland.  "We've always looked south and west of the [Potomac]," Collins said. "Nothing has really changed there. In this area, you do not want to cross any bridges." And the Cabal, speaking from its bunker deep beneath Dulles International Airport, defends itself. Virginia backers bristled at that characterization.   "We don't want anybody to get the impression that any resident of the national capital area isn't going to be a welcome fan of the Expos franchise," said Brian Hannigan, a spokesman for the Virginia Baseball Stadium Authority . . .  Hannigan failed to add, "As long as they have a damn helicopter to get to the games.  Ha ha ha!"  Seriously, though, it's really big of Hannigan to allow us to be a fan of the Virginia Monologues.  And if we want to nitpick, I suppose Denis isn't exactly correct - it's not that they don't want us ("us" meaning denizens of DC and Montgomery and Prince George's Counties) to come to the games, it's just that they don't give a rat's ass if we don't. "I think people are looking at the facts and making them personal, and I think that's unfortunate," added Loudoun County Board of Supervisors Vice Chairman Bruce E. Tulloch (R-Potomac). You're darn tooting people are making facts personal, and expect it to get worse.  You think the Post and Times aren't going to take sides on this?  Frankly, I'm surprised the Post hasn't already assigned a columnist to slam down the race card like it's a  urlLink Wild Draw Four .  They will. If Tulloch thinks this is bad, he might as well go follow  urlLink Pop-Tarts Presents American Idols Live  around Deadhead style, because it's going to get ugly over the next couple months. Virginia boosters said efforts to locate the team in the suburbs 20 miles west of the District were intended not as a snub to closer-in communities, but part of a strategy to counter Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who has argued that a team in the Washington region would sap his revenue. The Loudounites seem to be leaning really hard on this, and I'm not sure it's a good strategy.  Publicly, at least, Angelos ain't interested; he supports the San Juan bid.  The real problem for Angelos is not attendance but broadcast rights, and Loudoun isn't any better than DC in that respect. Plus they're lying: At a rally last month, Virginia supporters handed out maps showing that most of the District and Maryland were more than an hour's drive from a Dulles ballpark at rush hour . . .   Within days of making a case that seemed to dismiss much of the region, Northern Virginia retooled its message a bit. Supporters released a new map showing that most of the District and a wide swath of affluent Montgomery was within an hour's drive of their stadium at rush hour, and thus in their market area.  The difference? The earlier map showed a commute from 5 to 6 p.m. The second analysis covered 6 to 7 p.m. Ouch.  The Post is already taking sides.

       . . .  urlLink in favor  of moving the Expos to DC. "I really hope the Expos move to Washington. I feel a little bad for Mr. Angelos. But I was in Washington and it's just a huge city and a great city. And it's an hour from Baltimore. It's time to bring the national pastime back to the nation's capital," said Piazza. "I've heard that a team in Washington would hurt the Orioles. But it would also add another rivalry like the Yankees and us. D.C. is worthy of a team. There's a lot of politics involved, but it's definitely time to move the Expos to Washington."   It's the All-Star Break , and there's more news and less happening than ever before.  DC, Loudoun, and Norfolk have all sent lobbyists to Houston to . . . I don't know, get lied to in person, I guess.  MLB President Bob DuPuy  urlLink announced  that the next delay will be announced at the August 18-19 owners' meeting.  That's not how he put it, but I'm sure he winked when he said  "I think that owners meeting is a good working goal," DuPuy said. "The sooner the better. I know we've said this before. But it's time to get this done. I do not believe we won't have a decision this summer. Not a day goes by when we're not talking to the various [bid] cities."   Dave Sheinin  conducted a  urlLink chat  on the Post site, and he seemed rather confused.  Or maybe he had an intern do part of it.  At one point, he says In fact, if anything, I'd say the atmosphere has never been more encouraging for DC/northern Virginia. But his last contribution is Yes, the contraction scenario is still hanging out there -- the owners can revisit contraction after the 2006 season. However, I believe there will be a resolution to the Expos' siutation this summer. I just don't know if it will be the decision Washington-area fans want to hear. Is he predicting a Loudoun victory?  If so, his first comment is odd indeed.  I'm sticking by my intern story.

      The papers are churning out more and more Whither the Expos pieces, but that doesn't mean there's news.  Anthony Williams getting pissy with the Virginians and Peter Angelos calling the mayor of Baltimore a two-bit punk are certainly entertaining, but very little has changed since the announcement of the Loudoun plan.  My problem is that there isn't any news and that I don't feel the urge to cover the Expos if they're not going to wind up in DC.  That leaves me with very little to blog about.  Anyway, the Post had an  urlLink article  on Sunday rehashing the DC vs Loudoun argument.  There's also a  urlLink letter  from two DC council members who have reservations about Williams' financing plan.  Meanwhile, the Times has a Thom Loverro  urlLink piece  with no new information.  The column starts by saying: The prevalent feeling among baseball insiders is that after 32 years the issue of baseball returning to the Washington area is on the verge of being resolved.      That feeling is based purely on a sense of momentum rather than facts. One wonders why he bothered to write it, then.  Also worth checking it out is  urlLink this feature  in the Post.  They're recapping the 1924 season day by day, which is kind of nifty.  I won't spoil the ending for you.

      Just wanted to get  urlLink this  up early today: Major League Baseball's relocation committee will meet with District officials later this month in Washington to discuss financing options and construction schedules for a proposed ballpark, marking perhaps the most detailed session in the city's long quest for baseball.  . . .  Nonetheless, expectations are high within the District that a long-delayed decision on the future home of the Expos will arrive within a matter of weeks. Several of the other bidders for the Expos do not expect such a quick timetable, but most do think a choice will be made by the fall.      "We're very optimistic, and expect this to be settled in the next three, four weeks," said Mark Tuohey, chairman of the D.C. Sports & Entertainment Commission. It sounds pretty encouraging, but it could all be BS.  I've noticed that a good way to gauge my optimism is to see how closely I'm following the Expos.  And at the moment, it's not very closely.

      I was expecting all kinds of stuff to have happened while I was out of the loop.  Other than the coffee maker at work breaking, nothing.  Nothing in the Post, nothing in the Times other than some guy saying it would be tough to get from Bethesda to Dulles.  The best I can do is point out  urlLink this column  from Gammons.  Amid the non sequiturs and run-on sentences, Gammons says "So MLB should work out an extension for Minaya and assure that he moves on to D.C. . . ."  As I mentioned earlier, I'm not sure Gammons is making the distinction between DC and Loudoun, so maybe this isn't reassuring at all.

      I'm off to lovely Ocean City for the Fourth.  Sun, sand, and the Delmarva Shorebirds - what could be better?  I'll try to take some time off from Expo-speculation and Selig/Angelos-hatred, too.  Reader Ivan was kind enough to send a link to  urlLink Remember the Grays , who ask you to sign their petition to get a DC team called the Grays.  I've discussed this matter  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , in case you missed it.  Those posts were before I got all pissed off - it's a side of me I'd forgotten all about.  Anyway, enjoy the holiday, keep it real, etc., and I'll be back on Wednesday.

      I'm beginning to find this situation very tedious, so this will be quick and probably not up the standards of thigh-slappin' hilarity I try to maintain.   Murray Chass  has a  urlLink story in the New York Times  that says that MLB wants to move the Expos to DC or NoVa, but Angelos is in the way.  You already knew that, though.   The Speaker of the Virginia House  is  urlLink claiming  the Loudoun's funding might not be all that easy after all.  It's quite possible that none of this matters, because . . .   There seems to be  a growing sentiment that the Expos aren't going anywhere next year.   urlLink Off-Wing Opinion  has this:  If the Expos were coming to Washington in time for 2005, we'd already know. Trust me on this. Ahead of a large business announcement like this one, all sorts of preparations have to be made in the background -- preparations that inevitably create just the sort of background noise that would tip us off as to what's going to happen next.  urlLink Field of Schemes  chimes in as well.  Call me crazy, but I'm making plans for Opening Day 2005 in Montreal.   It's the tenth anniversary  of the 1994 strike, the one that cancelled a World Series and killed the Expos.  That combined with how MLB is handling relocation and the news that Bud Selig's getting an extension really makes me wish all the other sports didn't suck so much.

      I meant to have a review of  Beyond the Shadow of the Senators , but I don't have anything insightful to add. I strongly recommend it. It's well-written, well-researched, and even-handed. Like  Moneyball , it's an interesting narrative rather than a mere catalog of events. So go read it.   There was one bit  that seemed particularly interesting in light of current events. Calvin Griffith, the nephew and successor of long-time Senators' owner Clark Griffith, recalled:  Clark Griffith used to say, "If I could draw 350,000 people, I can make money." He made money 25 consecutive years there. The money that he made, though, was $1,000, $2,000, or $3,000, sometimes $10,000 or $15,000. In other words, enough to stay afloat, but not enough to improve the team. Sounds like Gabe Paul's "one million fans is plenty!" plan.  The Griffiths would have approved of ignoring fans from DC and PG County, as well.   Much has been made  since last week of a visit members of the relocation committee made to the area. The Times summary is  urlLink here .  The trip, led by MLB president Bob DuPuy and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, centered on both the commonwealth's financing plan and land acquisition for a proposed stadium in Loudoun County. MLB officials did not meet with any leaders from the District, which has its own bid for the Expos. But don't despair:  "There's nothing to read into that," said a industry source familiar with the session. "The Northern Virginia bid has more moving parts, the inclusion of the developers. There's more things that need to be clarified." So this trip may be a good or bad thing for the DC bid. It seems to depend on what you already think; if you're pro-DC, you see this trip reflecting the "Oops! We don't actually own the land!" difficulties that the  urlLink Cabal  is having. If you're wrong, you see it as an expression of interest in NoVa.   This next part is problematic , and I don't know if I should chalk it up to dumb owners or bad journalism. Neither baseball owners nor sportswriters are on my good list, so I'm kind of torn. Anyway, the Richmond Times-Dispatch has  urlLink another article  on Bob and Jerry's road trip.  Commissioner Bud Selig repeatedly has said he does not want to harm the Baltimore Orioles, who play about 40 miles from the capital, and the team executives said those statements have put renewed focus for some owners on the bid by Northern Virginia, which has proposed building a stadium in Loudoun County near Dulles International Airport, about 60 miles from the Orioles' Camden Yards ballpark. Oh crap! It's my worst nightmare! I'd better keep reading, though. There may be more information!   Orioles owner Peter Angelos has opposed moving the Expos to     e  i  t  h  e  r     area, saying in June that "another major-league baseball franchise in close proximity would result in two mediocre franchises from a competitive standpoint." [Orioles-themed empases mine]  So, here's the question: are owners so dumb that they would move the team to NoVa to help Angelos even though Angelos thinks it won't help Angelos? Or is Angelos actually lobbying for Dulles without letting us know about it for some reason? Or is this just a crappy article? I think the last of these is most likely.

      Warning: this post is lengthy and involves a lot of professional wrestling talk. It's totally relevant, but I thought you should know about that before you proceed.   Before I get underway,  I meant to link to  urlLink this  yesterday. David Vescey discusses some finds in his collection of 70s and 80s baseball cards, and it's the best thing Page 2 has ever done.  You apparently needed three things to be a major leaguer in 1979: big hair, porn-star-quality facial hair and huge wire-rim glasses. Terry Humphrey hit the trifecta in Topps No. 503. It gets better from there. Now, powered by the  urlLink new lyrics to Born in the USA , on to the rasslin.   We here at Distinguished Senators  are big fans of Washington Post columnist Marc Fisher, a crusading newshound in the tradition of Clark Kent and Peter Parker (I can't think of any real journalists). Fisher conducted a  urlLink chat on the Post website  today, and there was some baseball stuff in among all the talk of libraries and DJ salaries. Direct your eyesight here:  Angelos' comment about there being no real baseball fans in Washington was at best idiotic, at worst a veiled racist comment worthy more of Clark Griffith. Indeed. It's a shame Clark Griffith was such a racist (and, more to the point, segregationist) because he was a hell of an interesting character. More on that over the weekend, probably.  Angelos can't have it both ways--either there are tons of baseball fans here who have helped to support his team and whose loss he stays up at night worrying about, or there are no fans here and Washington can't support a team of its own. But not both. Hold on now! I don't like Angelos - you know that. But Fisher is here doing what he accuses Angelos of doing. Angelos was quite clear here: there are no baseball fans in DC, but there are in Maryland suburbs, and these are the fans he fears losing. Fisher makes it sound as if Angelos said no one in the entire area was a baseball fan, and that wouldn't be racist at all. So, either he's a racist for saying the fans are all in the majority white suburbs, or he's got no fans to lose. But not both.  The truth is that this area would support a team easily, and that Angelos would lose some fans from Washington and Virginia and maybe parts of Maryland, but he'd also gain from the competition with an NL team for the hearts and minds of residents of the region. I like this idea. I like it a lot, but you'll have to allow me a rather self-indulgent digression to explain it.   In this matter,  as in so many others, professional wrestling can be very instructive. Allow me to set up the scene: in the early 90s, the World Wrestling Federation was easily the country's top wrestling promotion. The WWF's flagship television program was Monday Night Raw on the USA Network, which came on Monday nights, oddly enough (and was usually followed by Silk Stalkings or La Femme Nikita - what a great channel!) . Raw ran unopposed from 1993 to 1995, and with no competition the show was allowed to become rather dull. Not wishing to give away on TV what they could charge for on pay per view, management booked Raw to feature mainly matches between established stars and "jobbers," the guys who always lose (where have you gone, Barry Horowitz? A nation turns its something eyes something something). Everyone knew what was going to happen, and it didn't make for exciting television, but it was the only show in town. Ratings were consistently between 2 and 3.5 of whatever it is you measure ratings in (ampules?).   Meanwhile,  philanthropist jackass Ted Turner had been pouring money into the WWF's competition, Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling. WCW had maintained its TV presence on the weekends until September 1995. Monday Nitro debuted that month and took the wrestling world by storm (that's the kind of thing you say about wrestling on TV). The inaugural episode saw  urlLink Lex Luger , who had appeared in WWF rings only weeks before, show up and do... well, something. It was ten years ago, so lay off. Into early 1996, the ratings of both shows stayed in Raw's old 2-3.5 ampule range. According to my genius calculations, this means that rather than WCW taking the WWF's audience, the Monday night wrestling audience effectively doubled. Keep that in mind.   Soon,  Nitro's ratings began to climb and climb. Powered by the nWo invasion storyline (you can still see the t-shirts. I mean actually  on  people), ratings moved steadily in the the 3s and eventually the 4s as Nitro ran off a long streak of victories against Raw. Nitro was the thing to watch, particularly if you were big fan of Scott Hall's fake-ass Scarface accent and Ric Flair's leathery man-boobs. Faced with extinction, the WWF innovated. Gone were the silly (relatively speaking) gimmicks; no more wrestling plumbers or Sgt. Slaughter pretending to be Iraqi. WWF owner Vince McMahon allowed his performers to craft their own personae and was rewarded by, among others, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin and the Rock. As these gentlemen became household names and Raw began to push the envelope of  extreme  (e.g., saying "ass" and flipping people off, both techinques used to great effect by this blog), Raw clawed its way back until, by 1998, both shows were in the 4s and 5s every week.   So, what's the lesson?  Conventional wisdom in 1995 held that either Raw or Nitro would fade away as a result of the direct competition. In fact, just the opposite happened. With more and better product out there, wrestling grabbed hold of the nation's pop culture conciousness in a way it never had before, even during the glory days of Hulkamania. Total viewership skyrocketed. It is entirely reasonable to think that more baseball in the Baltimore/DC area will result in more baseball fans than even a successful O's team could attract alone. Imagine the excitement the six times a year the Orioles and Senators would play each other. Imagine the effect competition could have on the way Peter Angelos runs his team. It's no coincidence that the A's get the small half of a shared market and are the most innovative team in baseball. Angelos' objections aside, a baseball team in Washington would not just be good for DC residents; it would not just be good for baseball as a whole; it would be good for the Orioles.

      Once again, there's not any news to report, but here I am anyway. I'll have a couple of book reviews coming up in the near future. I just finished  Beyond the Shadow of the Senators , and I'm leafing through  The Washington Senators, 1901-1971  by Tom "Frenchy" Deveaux. I have plenty of time to read what with the Metro being broken EVERY DAMN DAY. Not that I'm bitter.   Turns out that  Seattle Times story that had everyone so bummed is actually from Murray Chass of the New York Times (I'd link to it, but I can't find it, and we already know what it says). In case you missed it, Bud Selig reportedly stated twice that he woudn't do anything with the Expos that would make Peter Angelos unhappy. Yesterday, however, a  urlLink Norfolk paper had a denial  from Bob DuPuy, the Admiral Stockdale to Bud Selig's Ross Perot.   DuPuy, the second most powerful man in baseball , disputed a New York Times report indicating that the Expos would not relocate to Washington or Northern Virginia. . .   “The story is inaccurate, and you will note unsourced,” DuPuy said in an e-mail Monday to The Virginian-Pilot. “No decision has been made. Discussions are continuing with all candidates.”  Denials from DuPuy are like delays on the Metro; it seems like there's a new one EVERY DAMN DAY. A waiter asks him if he wants fries or baked potato and he's all, "no decision has been made. No potato preparation has been ruled out." Bagboys ask him if he wants paper or plastic, and he's all like . . . well, you see what I'm getting at. Take it for what it's worth - no one who writes for the Times would ever make anything up, right?   The Orioles are   urlLink  coming to town   !   The Baltimore Orioles will hold their 6th annual "D.C. Summer FanFest" on Wednesday, August 18, from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at Farragut Square. Apparently the Orioles are trying to appeal to people without jobs. Which makes sense, actually, if they want fans to be able to get to Baltimore in time for weeknight games. I went to one of these things a couple years, and Jeff Conine signed my free Sportstalk 980 t-shirt. My roommate addressed him as "champ." Anyway, go down there and protest if you have nothing to do. I work for a living, at least until this blogging gig starts paying the mad scrilla, and I ain't in Sullivan territory just yet.   There's another DC baseball  urlLink message board   out there. It's bigger and even nastier than the Fanhome one. These people can't say  anything  without resorting to sarcasm. But it's informative, at any rate.   Apropos of nothing,  here's why Wins and Losses are the worst stats in baseball: Walter Johnson is possibly the greatest pitcher in Major League history. He spent his entire career with the Washington Senators/Nationals, and they were terrible for almost all of it. Johnson lost  26 games  by a score of 1-0. Those losses had nothing to do with Johnson and everything to do with his crappy teammates, yet pitchers are still judged by "their" wins and losses.   Hey, the Orioles  can beat the Mariners! Who needs a team in DC?

      I've been in a pretty crappy mood about our prospects, so I've been derelict in keeping up with things. I'd promise it won't happen again, but it will.   As you may have heard,  the trade deadline came over the weekend, and did it ever rock. The Expos, Twins, Red Sox, and Cubs threw a bunch of players into a pot, each team grabbing what it wanted. The Expos rid themselves of sore-backed malcontent Orlando Cabrera and picked up Alex Gonzalez, a pretty crappy shortstop himself, and a couple of prospects (3B Brendan Harris and RHP Francis "the Other" Beltran). Chris Kahrl's Transaction Analysis columns in  urlLink Baseball Prospectus  are subscription only, but I don't think they'll mind my saying that she gave it a  urlLink thumbs-up  from the 'Spos' standpoint. Indeed, "next year's Expos team could be a passel of kids with promise." Now if Peter Angelos would only return to the Stygian depths whence he came, we could have a good ol' time.   Speaking of Trading Day,  you won't find a bigger divide between the statsy types on the Web and the mainstream sports media than in analysis of the  urlLink Dodgers/Marlins blockbuster  (with the possible exception of the debate over the value of Derek Jeter). Each side thinks someone got fleeced - the old school fellows cite Paul LoDuca's veteran leadership and Guillermo Mota's setupping goodness, while the more sabermetrically inclined point out that Juan Encarnation sucks and that the Marlins got really badly screwed.  In  urlLink this article from Jayson Stark , the most important guy in the trade is completely dismissed. See if you can spot it:  All he traded was his fifth starter (Brad Penny), a platoon guy (Hee Seop Choi), a bench player (Abraham Nunez) and two minor leaguers (Bill Murphy and Travis Chick)," said one NL front-office man. I guess slugging 25-year-olds with great plate discipline who make chump change aren't worth what they used to be. Choi is currently putting up a .270/.388/.495 line, which, in technical terms, is rad, particularly for a guy years away from free agency. The Cubs' trading Choi for Derrek Lee was one of the great unheralded dumbass moves of the off-season, as the Cubs paid almost six million bucks for an improvement at 1B that was, if anything, marginal. Now it's happened to Choi twice, but I think he's found a home with Paul DePodesta in LA.   Dick Heller  had  urlLink another article  about  urlLink remembering those Grays  on Saturday (clarification: the article came out on Saturday, but does not advocate remembering the Grays on Saturday specifically). If you've been following the advice of the country's leading scientists and reading everything I've been telling you to, there's nothing you probably haven't heard before, but what the heck.   I advise you to listen  to Sportstalk 980 here in the DC area from 10-11 am on Saturdays.  urlLink Baseball Roundup  with Marc Sterne (neither of whose names is spelled the way one would expect) naturally spends a good amount of its hour on relocation. If you hear a guy with a thick Australian accent complaining about the  urlLink Loudoun Cabal , that's probably me using my radio voice.   A free article on   urlLink  BP   led me to  urlLink Field of Schemes , where Neil "the Mouse" daMause discusses the thieving SOBs who run the National Pastime. There's a lot of Expos content over there. I'm going to put up a link when I get around to it.   I'm off to Camden  tomorrow night for the Orioles vs. the Mariners. It's not my fault;  urlLink some dumbass Mariners fan  I know wanted to go months ago, that game got rained out, and then he skipped town. I will be wearing my Senators hat (or, as the kids say, "Rocking my Nats chapeau"), don't you worry.

      Here we are in August with no team and no timetable for getting one. Not that anyone in Washington cares, now that Joe Gibbs has come to save us all.   You've probably already heard  that they  urlLink won't have a decision  on the Expos at the owners' meetings (August 18-19). I'm not sure that we've had any confirmation on this, but if Hal Bodley says it, it must be true.   Over at the   urlLink  message board     Generalissimo Chris Rehling pointed out  urlLink this extremely depressing article  from the Seattle Times.  Contrary to widespread expectations, Washington-area fans and officials are presumably in for a major disappointment by not getting the Montreal Expos for next season or any season. Commissioner Bud Selig told Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles owner, who opposes the Expos' relocation in what he considers Orioles territory, that he would not do anything with the Expos that made Angelos unhappy. Selig made that statement directly to Angelos in Houston on the day of the All-Star Game, and he repeated it later that day in a meeting with baseball's bankers. Some baseball people speculated that Selig would put the team in Washington or northern Virginia anyway and make Angelos happy by giving him a large sum of money from the Expos sale. But Angelos shot down that idea. "The answer is no," he said when asked if money would do the trick. "You don't destroy a franchise in return for some kind of cash payment." Man, I hope that's not true. Here's the thing: Angelos has no right to stop a National League team in DC. If an AL team were trying to move here, he'd have a veto, but this is one of the few areas in which there is still a distinction between the leagues. It would be a real shame if Bud Selig deprived baseball of a market the quality of DC merely because he's friends with Angelos.   I've got some other stuff , but I'll save it. The Cards are on.
