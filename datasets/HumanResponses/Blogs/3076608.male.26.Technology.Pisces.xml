      So the weekend is on me again and since I am back to square one again I wonder what this one is going to be like. There is a party that I will most likely be attending but I honestly don't really even want to go. If by chance&nbsp; I find something a bit more interesting to do, I will probably cop out. Unfortunately I do have to work tomorrow at Hot Topic so I am not sure how late I will actually be out or if I will even get torn or not.&nbsp; Then again, I am not sure I can handle the party scene sober so the thought of going straight seems a little far fetched. I will be spending time with Vanessa which will most likely mean I will have to see and deal with f'n Tim too. I swear I get so freaking tired of seeing the f'er everywhere I go for fun. I swear sometimes I just want to stomp him into the ground just to get him out of my system and feel better about the entire situation.&nbsp; It probably would be in his best interest to stay as far away from me as possible otherwise things could get ugly.&nbsp; Honestly I think a lot of the frustration and anger I have for Mike (the f'er that used to be my best friend until he slept around with my ex-fiance on my own couch.. long story). Since Tim basically did the same thing as Mike they both stand in the same category to me anymore. Neither of them would be safe in a closed room with me alone because I would gladly stomp either one of them into the ground and not think twice about it.   If anyone knows me personally they would probably be thinking right now "What in the world is going on with Seth, he is not a violent person" Well, for the most part that is correct. The reason why I am normally not a violent person is because I do not have enemies, for the most part. If you do something bad enough to make it to my enemy list, then I feel sorry for you because I am really never going to be nice to that person again. In my life I only have two people that I would really consider to be my enemy and Tim and Mike are both of them. Both of them took perfectly good friendships and threw them back in my face. Neither of them cared about how I felt so why in the world should I give two flips for anything they think or feel. If I could have about 15 minutes alone with each of them then I would probably be fine and never have another second thought about hating them. Unfortunately, I have tried to be the civil one about the entire situation but all it has done is fill me full or rage and regret for not whipping their ass into the ground.   I am sure that one day I will be over both situations but its not going to happen any time soon. I think I would probably have to go about a year or more without seeing either of them before I could actually be over either situation entirely. Unfortunately I see them way too much then I care to. Some more than others but both way too much. I wish there was a cure for this anger and rage I have inside for both of them but the only thing I think would make me feel better is physical retribution.&nbsp; I know that must sound pretty low of me, but I have never had people treat me as poorly as both of them did. No one has showed less care for my feelings then them so I don't care what they feel unless it is pain and then I probably couldn't be happier.   So who is to say what this weekend will bring. I am officially out of people that I am pursuing or am interested in. I would love to have a lovely lady to spend some time with but it looks like I will just be hanging out with Vanessa. I am not complaining of course, because we all know how I feel about Vanessa but for my own mental health its better that I don't hang out in places where Vanessa and Tim are in the same location. All it does is make my blood boil.&nbsp; I know I should be over this already but its hard when someone say they are your friend to your face but then stab you in the back. If I cant trust someone, then there is no way that I can be friends with them. So I think I will just go and make the best of the situation. If I have to hang out with Vanessa and Tim then so be it, I will make the best of the situation that I can.   As long as I can avoid drama or feeling like my guts are getting ripped out then I should be fine. I am not going to be able to stay too awfully long at the party so I should be able to avoid feeling bad for the most part. It really sucks that I cant go anywhere anymore without him affecting me negatively. He seems to show up everywhere and every time that Vanessa and I hang out. I guess I have to just start getting used to it since Vanessa and him are going out but there is no way that I will ever like him or trust him again. I can eventually tolerate his presence but he shouldn't ever expect me to be civil or even remotely nice to him. See Vanessa doesn't really know Tim. She thinks she does but what she knows is what he has told her. I have known him and known of him a hell of a lot longer than she has. She always gives people hell for being whores but what she doesn't know is that he is one of the biggest whores I have ever met. The fact that he even touched her makes me want to break his fingers off. If she knew how many people that he has slept with and the scum he has slept with, and it wouldn't surprise me if it were both sexes, then she probably wouldn't have gotten with him. I hope that Vanessa gets tested some time soon because that whore has bound to have caught something by now. I worry for Vanessa because I know she doesn't use protection like she should. I would have said something to her but I figured him having sex with Laura unprotected would have been enough to keep Vanessa from ever messing around with him. I never would have thought she would have gone for that fag anyway. He is one of the queerest straight guys I have every met. Unfortunately she was stupid about it and did it anyway. So in theory she has slept with Laura too and that really disgusts me. I worry more than anything though.   One last thought. If Vanessa ever removes her little barrier of protection on Tim I am going to hunt him down and beat the living sh!t out of him. It will be a good day that day. Heaven forbid he ever hurt her or do anything to tick her off because it will be just enough of an excuse for me to ruin his face. I will take great pride in cutting off that gay pony tail and making him eat part of it. Kung Fu has been very good for me but now its starting to turn into&nbsp;a 101 ways to kick Tim's ass. I know I am bad, but at this point I really don't care. Being the good guy has gotten me no where so I will just go back to doing what I do best. Being the evil f'er that I really am. My horoscope said today that I should be the real me, well this is me folks. Its just a dern shame that I wont get to act on all these pleasant thoughts. Instead I have to just sit on them and try and be a good boy. One day I will have my chance to turn this situation around and feel better about the entire thing, but until then I will just have bite my lip, grind my teeth and bare it.&nbsp;I will be fine of course, because I am the master of my own emotion but on the inside sometimes I just want to explode just so I can feel some relief for five minutes. Instead I am stuck trying to be the nice guy because I don't want to tick Vanessa off and make her hate me. She is the only thing that keeps me from resolving this entire situation but its probably for the best. I am afraid what I would do to Tim anyway if I were ever given the opportunity to hurt him.   Chance are tonight will be little to no fun for me. I am tired of the party scene. I am tired of the people that are in it. All&nbsp;I want to do is relax and have a stressless free time but its not going to happen so I will start dealing with it now so that when the time comes for us to go to the party I will be ready to deal with the actual event. If I am lucky I will find some really cute girl to pretend to love me and get me the heck out of that place. Knowing my luck though, I will just come in with Vanessa and probably leave alone.&nbsp;I will of course update you on what really happens... More definitely to come. (Hopefully with some freaking good news for once).   Here is my prediction for the night, and&nbsp;it will be fun to see how accurate I am. I will probably have a late start with Vanessa, have a good time with her for a bit, go to the party and be bored and annoyed, then go home either alone or with Vanessa and just pass out. Chances our my time with Vanessa will be great as usual but as soon as I get around the rest of the crowd it will just go down hill from there. As always I look forward to spending time with my best friend but dont look forward to having to deal with a bunch of people I dont know, like or care to tolerate. Well, so goes my life. Its all good. Its just another weekend and nothing I havent been dealing with for god knows how long anyway.&nbsp; {sigh}

      Alright, so this is day two, and I have already learned a valuable lesson. Second attempts at already failed missions bring the same reward as the already failed mission if not more. I made the mistake again of thinking that there was something more than what it really is. I am fool for thinking that already someone that I am interested in is actually interested back. No, the curse still stands true for my life. I am doomed to be the good friend no one wants anything serious with. I am not really surprised, or really upset for that matter. In all honesty, I tested the waters and only found them to be bitter and hard. So its day two and I am back to square one again. There are plenty of people that I am somewhat interested in but no one that is interested back. Sometimes I wish I wasn't such a risk taker but if I didn't take risks I think that I would never really find what I am looking for. Just one thing to keep in mind above everything else when it comes to taking risks. Never involve your friends in any risks that you take in your life. Hold to your friends and the people that are already important to you like valuables in a safety deposit box. Its better to keep them away from the rest of the bank and greedy little hands than to involve them and take the chance of losing them.&nbsp; Lock them away some place safe and never take the chance of putting them into the same place as the rest of your money. If everything else falls apart and you think you have lost it all, at least you still hold to the most valuable object you could own, good friends.   You know the saying "don't count your chickens before they hatch"? Well that lesson is one that you should always keep in the back of your mind all the time. Take things at face value but remember your world can be turned upside down overnight. Nothing you have in this world is constant.&nbsp; Here today, gone tomorrow. I think that should be my theme phrase.&nbsp; It can be applied to just about every aspect of my life. That is what is the most frustrating part of my life is. I have no constants, just temporary amusement and entertainment. The moment I hold something dear to me is the prelude to me losing it. I wish I could just find one person or one thing in my life that I knew belonged to me and that wasn't going anywhere no matter what. That is my dream. I just want one thing that I can hold to and never worry about losing.&nbsp; So this is day two and there is yet to be anything good to say just yet. I have knocked another potential from my list and am left with a blank list all over again. More to come when more has happened.. Tonight will be a quiet night at home after Kung Fu. All I want is to sleep and sleep and sleep....

       So this is the beginning. I have started a new chapter in my life. What will come of it, only time will tell. All I know is that even though I still have pain and scars from the last relationship I attempted, still I have more hope than I did. So I will start off my entries with a question.     &nbsp;  How do you tell a person that you are interested without scaring them off?    &nbsp;  I have the worst luck with confessing my feelings and being rejected. Most people are not interested in getting to know me or being close. Mainly they are more concerned about what they can get out of me. Sounds harsh? Unfortunately it is the truth. I have not figured out exactly why girls use me the way that they do but I can only blame most of it on my kindess. This time I refuse to put myself through going through the same thing I have been through time and time again. I am torn between being me, nice guy, and getting hurt and being the guy I want to be, the jerk, and getting what I want. Sounds like an easy decision, doesnt it? But its not. I have always wanted to be myself and no one else without being judged or rejected. Now is the time for me to be myself, but the scars and pain that I have been subjected to throw up walls that keep me from coming out of my shell. I am not done healing enough to feel comfortable giving my all, but I dont want anyone to think I am something that I am not. So the beginning starts with me. Plain and simple. Take it or leave it. I am not going to be the pushover that everyone obviously thinks that I am. I am going to be the man I have been raised to be and worked so hard to become. I am going to be me and hope that one day someone will want exactly who I am.     &nbsp;  Tonight is a test. A test to see if being myself can truly pay off in any way. I am going to be 100% honest and express my feelings without worry or concerns about the affects of what I say. I am not going to push myself on anyone or my feelings for that matter. I am simply going to do what feels right. If something negative comes of it, I will not blame myself for the negative reaction. If nothing comes of it, then nothing was meant to happen. If something positive comes from it, then I am sure it will make me much happier than I have been in quite some time.    &nbsp;  One thing is for certain. I am starting at the beginning but I am already tired of being alone in this world with no one to care for or care for me. We will see how things go. I can only hope that it all works out.

      Sometimes I wonder if the problem with me is that I am blinded my own ego. I have begun to wonder what the deal is with me.  I wonder sometimes if the problem is I see myself more than what I truly am. Am I not as attractive as I think I am? Do girls not see me the way I see myself? Should I think more lowly of myself? I think that maybe if I did that I wouldnt shoot so high or go for girls that I cant get. Then I think, is my problem that I am just not going for the right girls. I have reviewed all the people that I have dated lately, which has been quite a few and I think that maybe the problem has got to be who I am dating and not myself. Then I think that way of thinking is the problem and the reason I am constantly disappointed. I think "I have all these gorgeous girls that just want to be my friend, but none of them want anything more than that." What is my problem truly? Am I ugly? Am I not nice enough? Am I not mean enough? Do I not make enough money? All I want is to be myself and for someone to like me for who I am, not because of how much I fit into society's click. I dont want to be like the guys around me or think even a thing like they do, but yet its those scum that seem to win the girls.  Then I think that I have spent all of my life being the outkast and the weird one. I have always been set apart from the rest of the crowd. At one time it was that seperation that made me special and even feel special amongst everyone around me. Now it just makes me feel lonely. I am tired of being rejected and for no good reason. People all love me and want to be around me, but none want to get close enough to fill this void in my heart. This is a lonely cold world that I live in. I could choose to be someone different and wear a mask like the rest of the world, hiding from who I am and the truth about how life truly is, but in the end I know I would not be happy. Instead I take life and embrace its truth. In the mean time, it makes me feel like I am going to go crazy. My codependant nature makes me crave a connection with someone, even on the most minimal level.  I have begun to appreciate the platonic relationships I have with the numerous women I spend time with. I can appreciate them for who they are without them having to worry about me chasing after them or trying to get into their pants. In the mean time, it has left a bitter taste in my mouth for the rest of the guys that I know. All they ever seem to be interested in is winning that girls panties or the prize of some temporary physical reward. I am tired of persuing goals that leave me in the same state as I started when I finish the race. Meaningless sex hardly is even a positive thing in my head anymore. The last girl that I slept with was a feable attempt on my own part to somehow win over something more than just sex in the end.  Of course it was no surprise when in the end I was left with the same empy feeling as when I started. To be honest it has made sex even seem poor to me.  The last time I felt anything when I slept with someone was when I was with Vanessa. Of course I find out now that it meant nothing to her. To her it was just "crazy times"  as she put it. I really should not have been surprised at all. She was in such a vulnerable time then that I only imagine that half the things she said and did, she did not mean at all. Of course it takes those happy times I had in my memory and dashes them on the rocks. It makes me feel like another whole year of my life was wasted. I feel like a fool because it was me in the beginning that said that it would end this way but I simply chose to forget it and try to make the best of the situation. At least Vanessa came out alright in the end, or at least better off.  I think that most people in this world are not compatible with me. Most have issues that I cant or dont want to deal with. The last girl that I wanted to try something with I found was cursed with Herpes. Frankly I could never get with someone that had any STD, even if it was just at one time and had gone completely away. So what am I left? If most girls are dirty, or psycho then I am left with this tiniest percentage of girls that I can choose from. I feel like because of my past that I have become too picky but if I wasnt then I would end up unhappy anyway. Should I continue to be this picky and take the chance of being alone in the end? Or should I just start settling for those girls that I am not attracted to or have nothing in common with? I dont know what to do anymore. I am deathly afraid of dying alone or even just growing old alone.  I feel like my days are numbered. If something doesn't happen soon for me, then there is a chance that it never will. I wish I could just make a ton of money and just steel away the people that I hold dear. I want out of this town and away from the same old thing. Most people strive to be different but all they end up being is like everyone else. I am tired of people being sheep and not having a mind or life of their own. I am tired of the leeches of this world that cant seem to acquire anything on their own, but simply want to feast off of the riches of others. I am tired of the things that I hold dear being taken away from me. I just want to find someone that can look me in the eye on every level and at least understand who I am and why I do what I do. I have begun to think that I will never find it. I thought that I had found it but only found that I was just a joke.  Maybe I should just start trying to get used to being alone. I should stop trying to make other people happy because no one really cares about making me happy. Still I have little pleasures left in this world and making others happy does give me some kind of joy. If I stopped, then I am afraid I would have little to nothing left to find pleasure in. Its a shame that I am left with making others happy because I cant seem to find out to make myself happy anymore. I keep thinking that living like a monk would be the true answer to my happiness. Everything I read about being truly happy all say the same thing "Simplicity is the key to true happiness" . Normally I would agree with that fully but my life could not be anymore simple anymore.  I have little to nothing to show for anything yet I am still miserable. Of course I think too that my life could be a lot worse, but if it were I am not sure I could handle it mentally.  Oh well, I know that this entry has been pretty sporadic and hard to follow but my mind is about on the same level lately. There is nothing that I can put my focus on anymore because every good thing is tainted by a black spot that I have to avoid now. I instead spend my time taking advantage of the good times and running from the bad. I dont even bother to talk or act on the things that affect me negatively. I just run. Is that bad? Is it wrong for me to turn away and refuse to deal with the things I cannot change? My feelings and opinions of others I fear is beginning to affect my normal everyday life. I wish I could go back to being simple minded and not knowing anything about the people around me. Instead I know too much. I know more information about people than I would ever care to repeat.  If I could just forget what I know and block out everything else I hear then I would be fine with the people that surround me. Instead I am stuck with knowledge that makes me dislike people in general. Everyone has dirt on them and it taints my image of them. Its this town in general. I was just talking to my latest platonic friend Miriam about the same thing this weekend. Both of us see this town the same way and that its grown old because of the people within it. I wish I could just start over. I wish I could forget the good times and the bad. If I could forget the good times, then maybe the bad times wouldnt seem so bad. Maybe I wouldnt have the problem I do with some of the people in my life. If I could have my way I would just filter out half this town, but instead I am left to just deal with them. How will I get by? I couldnt tell you..
