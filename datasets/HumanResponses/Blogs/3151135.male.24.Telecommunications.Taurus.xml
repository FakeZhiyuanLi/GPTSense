      05/17/04  Well, I am going to start off saying...    My name is Alan Norman, and I am a nicotine addict. I have stopped nicotine for 12 days, 23 hour, 10 minutes and 52 seconds. I've not smoked 324 death sticks, and saved $48.65. I've saved 1 day and 3 hours of my life.    Okay, enough of that.  Tonight I watched the movie "The Life of David Gale" and I must say.  At first I thought it sucked but than I really got into it and quite enjoyed it.  There was something Kevin Spaceys charachter said in the movie that really stuck out with me while he was lecturing his class (and I subquote here) ...  "Fantasies have to be unrealistic, because the moment you get what you seek, you dont, you cant, want it anymore. In order to continually exist, desire must have its objects pepetually absent, its not the "it" you want, its the fantasy of "it".  Desire creates crazy fantasies...  we are only truely happy while daydreaming about future happiness.  Living by your wants will never make you happy.  What it means to be fully human is to strive to live by idea's and ideals and not to measure your life by what you've obtained by your desires, but the small moments of integrity, compassion and rational,  even self sacrifice, because in the end the only way we can measure the significance of our own lives is by valuing the lives of others."  No, I diddnt remember all of that (thank god for DVD players) but I found myself particularly inspired by it because in a very complex sort of way whoever wrote the screen play for this movie seemed to have written that part for Alan Norman, a 24 year old daydreamer in Ocala Florida.  I swear to God, I spend the majority of my life daydreaming about something.  But I think its almost human nature.  I daydream mostly about Atlanta.  You know, as I sit here right now I can tell you I probably have given most of my daydreaming career to that city.  And honestly, I dont know why.  Now Ive always said that Atlanta was my home, and in alot of respects it is.  When I went to Atlanta I had nothing, I left with nothing.... but some of the greatest memories of my life.   Everything Ive done in the past 2 years or so seems so safe.  I took a risk with Atlanta.  And I miss it greatly.  But I dont think, in fact, I know.... that the good memories that are assiciated with Atlanta are just that.  Memories.  Nothing stays the same and people change.  Its a fact of life.  And I cannot expect anything to be the same.  But for some reason I am drawn to that place.  Its like my pulse.  And I am patiently awaiting the day I will round that large hill on that interstate and see the skyline again, and know that I am home.  On my own grounds, on my own terms.  And purhaps, maybe then I will be truely happy.  Purhaps then I may learn to grow fond of the thick skin I am in.  There are still so many things in my life that I need to say good-bye to.  Lately I have found myself walking through stores, especially home decor stores daydreaming about my own place, filled with such beautiful things... a home.  I dont have a home right now.  I mean, in respects I have a place to live.  But its not home.  And I am searching for home.  Why have I been searching in all the wrong places?  Nothing seems new to me anymore, which is sad because I am only 24 and everything should still seem new.  God, I just want to be able to stand up on my own two feet.  I want people, prefferably my friends to look at me and have some sort of respect for me and some things that Ive accomplished.  I want to do so many things, and honestly, I have no idea where to start.  I am hoping to find out soon though....       A list of things I dream about:  Love A family Nobody dying in my life peace direction The complete and utter unfocused desire to know what to do with that direction What it might be like to look into the eyes of my soul mate true friends, not the cracker jack ones I surround myself with right now  A good nights sleep.... goodnight.  There is more but I dont want to look TO pathetic.  I promise to post more about the diet later.

      05/16/04 (Okay, my internet was down for a few days so I have to post of this on the same day)  Okay so Ive run into a bit of a roadblock here, and the only thing that is going to remedy this is time and time alone.  Due to a change of circumstances involving a serious lack of funds I was very limited to what I could purchase when I went grocery shopping.  I had less than $10 to buy food for two weeks... so the cheapest things I could buy had the most carbs in them.  Rice... uhg.  Ramen Noodles... double uhg.  There was a special where hot dogs were a package for $1 so I bought three.  Hot dogs are FAR from healthy.  But rather than just go hungry, I bought these things and I figure that since I am done with smoking (OMG, imagine me trying to nurse as addiction AS well having no money)...  Ive done it before and honestly, I dont want to go back to that place.    Here is my daily record for nicotine:  My name is Alan Norman, and I am a nicotine addict. I have stopped nicotine for 11 days, 13 hours, 30 minutes and 33 seconds. I've not smoked 289 death sticks, and saved $43.38. I've saved 1 day and 5 minutes of my life.  Yay, an entire day.  Hopefully Ill be laying out in the sun, thinking about nothing, spending time with the person I love on that last day.  ;o)  So I figured that I may just rough it out in the next two weeks.  I mean, rice is low in fat so if I ate alot of that Im sure mixed with working out I will be able to lose some weight.  And then when I have some more money I can just go out and buy all the stuff that is good for me.  The thought of eating nothing but rice for two weeks is not especially appealing.  Hey, the Chineese do it.  Ive never really seen a fat chineese person aside from a western oriental, so we may be onto something.  Maybe with some spices, a little sauce here and there... it wont be that bad.  Ive come to the conclusion Im not even going to stress it.  You know, I had wanted to lose so much weight for this Madonna show but I think I am going to take it a bit further than that.  I swore that 2004 was the year that was going to change me and I truely beleive that it is.  I want to look good for the show.  Maybe Ill go and do some walking today.  I cannot afford to go to the gym yet.  In another month, Ill be able to do that.  Than the weight will seriously start comming off.  I feel like its all beginning to form in my brain, it just doesnt happen at the same time or quickly.  Its a process.    Add on for today:  You know, I realized today that if you dont actually do what your writing down on paper, you can write as much as you want and it means nothing.  "If I jump in this fountain will I be forgiven?" ~Alanis Morissette.

      You know, I dont really know why I have been putting off starting my blog.  I've always had this really weird thing for diarys in the first place but I think by now that I am at a good point in my life to begin one.  Blogs are strange, especially because they are so public.  I write this because I want to keep a record of something important in my life and when I type I cant tell if I should be typing to other people or just simply to myself.  Either way, nobody will probably ever read this anyways.    The entire reason I am starting a record of all my experiences is because in the next year, my life is going to change so much for the better.  Weight wise, health wise and overall, I think that 2004 is going to be the year that I truely give back to myself.  While time goes on I know I will get more comfortable with writing in this and I will probably start to post more.  But in the meantime, I should get started on what I beleive to be the beginning of my very own personal "re-invention".  I got this idea from Madonna of course, who in 9 days time is starting her own "Re-Invention World Tour".  I had made these big plans on July 24th to go to Atlanta and see a show or two, stay a week and be able to hold my own when it came to things like the White Water Rafting trip, mountain biking and hiking up some mountains in Tennessee.  When we had made these plans I thought to myself that there was no way in my physical and mental condition would I be able to accomplish any of these things and me able to live to tell about them.    So as time is going by I began to formulate a personal plan for some sort of success.  It wasnt untill my 24th birthday (April 30th) that I woke up and I realized that I was not only a chronic chain smoker.  But I also weighed 335 LBS.    I am officially obease.  And as much as Ive always hated that word.  As of right now it is the only word to describe me.  Ive always been very lucky to be able to carry my weight around very well.  I am 6'3 and Ive always been big, but never have I been this big.  And it was time that I do something about it.  I am hoping that this blog will be a keeper of my secrets and journey.  Ive been going through alot of shit in my life lately and this is only the beginning.  This is my free therapist.  Im going to name my blog,  Weave.  Its an "extention" of my life and it wont dissolve in the blue water.  Yeah, Im weird.  Get over it ;o)  So in my formulation I knew that I needed to quit smoking first.  I mean, it only seems logical.  I knew I would never be able to accomplish what I needed to accomplish excersize wise smoking almost 2 packs a day.  And yes, it was that bad.  So one night on Thursday May 4th I was driving home and I smoked my last cigarette.  That night I dont know why but I diddnt stop at the store to buy more.  And when I went to bed that night I pondered if I really could accomplish this and I came to the conclusion that I would never get anywhere in my life if I could at least prove to myself that I could beat nicotine.  Something so small... something in the big picture of things, so entirely trivial.  An addiction that when just looking at the tiny picture of things consumes your life.  Your whole world revolves around smoking.  And in this day and age, frankly it is becomming trashy to be a smoker.  You smell, you have to ALWAYS carry them with you, you have to go outside to smoke in places where food is being served (which made me feel like the biggest loser, just leaving my friends at the table).  It consumes you.  And to top it off, I was not just a normal smoker.  I always smoked in exess.  1 pack a day wasnt enough.  I was obsessed in a way.  So that night I made a decision that I beleive is going and has changed my life.  I said no to my addiction to nicotine.    The next day I woke up and went about my day.  See the thing is, when you quit something like nicotine its almost like you obsess over it.  You think about it all the time and even though the physical cravings come and go you sort of deal with a double whammy and then have to deal with your psycological cravings.  But my first goal was 72 hours because that was the mark when all the nicotine is out of your system.  And now I am proud to say:  My name is Alan Norman, and I am a nicotine addict. I have stopped nicotine for 10 days, 1 hour, 20 minutes and 27 seconds. I've not smoked 251 death sticks, and saved $37.73. I've saved 20 hours and 57 minutes of my life.  (You will be seeing the above a few more times.  I think maybe for the first 3 months.  Than after that it most likely will not be needed anymore.)  I know I am not entirely "out of the woods" yet, so to speak.   But I am over the major hump.  And I honestly beleive that I am not going to take another cigarrette.  I am done, and for that I am very proud of myself.  Something that is very far a few in-between.   So this is what Weave is going to be about.  My journey.  My step away from this life and building my golden ticket for the next.  Ill put some poetry in here, some random thoughts, pictures and the such.  My life... as I see it.   I cant wait to get started.  Well, yes I can.  I have a ton of work ahead of me.  Oui.
