      OK i have been doing some reseach tonight trying to find a bit of history about 'nothing' hopefully that will lead me on to some clues as to what exacully nothing is:    The word 'nothing' was first traced back to a cave man, named Dohnk who lived during the stone age. It is said he created the word becuase he use to slur his words together, and while saying,  "vios higoff" (no thing). He mistakenly combined the two words (voishigoff) and created the word nothing. When asked what definition he would like to give the new word he created, he is believed to have said, "Nothing comes to mind." This has been interpreted by Italian historian Biasonni Ignorentti as saying, there is no definition for nothing because no definition is the definition.  so there is a bit of hisroy of nothing. Nothing has no definition- acording to Mr Ignorentti, i will soo find out for my self weather that is true!

      没什么, □什麼, niets, rien, nichts, τίποτα, niente, 何も, 아무것, nada, ничего, nada, niks, ei mikään, nusquam, intet. Ok im guessing that you could not read all/any of of the about, unless of couse you happen to speak 17 different language. You may of guessed it, you may have not, but the above writting is the word 'nothing' translated into 17 different languages.   Right now you are probably thinking to yourself, wait a minute i see the word 'nada' repeated twice, she has only translated it into 16 languages. But your wrong!. The word 'nada' is translated from the word 'nothing' in two differant languages.

      While searching "what is nothing" on ask jeeves i came across a site that looks quite usefull! for all of you wanting to visit it is:  urlLink The Site    For those who could not be bothered visiting i will explain what was on the site. At the top of the page in bold letters it reads "doing nothing ???" i clicked the link as there was no other option (i must of been doing nothing) and the link took me down to the bottem on the page, which read, "..... That's why there is nothing on this page!!" So i have found nothing. Nothing must be on that page.   But i still could not pick out what it was, the page was fluro green with blue writting, that therefore dismisses my previous claim that nothing was dull. Now im even more confussed.  Soo close - yet so far from finding the truth :(

      My search for an image of nothing ended quite unsuccesful, i search both yahoo and google for images of nothing. While most images just contained the word 'nothing' i found a variety of other images included coathangers, semi-naked people, cartoon faces and roadsigns. I investigated for quite some time trying to piece these images together to get a picture of nothing. But i found little in common, although most images tended to be of dull colour, so so-far i will conclude nothing is most likeing something of a dull appearance.

      Have you every wondered to yourself What is nothing? i certainly have and that is why i have made this blog, to find out once and for all What nothing is..  Firstly i have found a defination of "nothing" in the oxford pocket dictionary. Accordig to it nothing is: no thing, not anything, naught  Ok they have given words, but this not help me i still dont know exactly what nothing is, i now know it is 'no thing' but what is 'no thing' what does it look like.  Looks like more investigating me to do....
