       urlLink Mailee  and I managed to spend about a buck.5 at the mall today...&nbsp; bought out Nordstrom’s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Couldn’t stop shopping and releasing our aggressions towards men by releasing our credit cards to the registers.&nbsp; It was exhausting and we left with hurting feet and aching backs – but damn, we are gonna look good in these new clothes!   After a quick nappy nap and spruce up shower we embarked on our typical Sunday night... we spent it at Noche.&nbsp; Before we even got there we expected it to be an eventful evening.&nbsp; Little did we know just how eventful it would be.&nbsp;   Mailee was convinced Joel was going to break up with her (how can they break up, they aren’t together?)…&nbsp; she was almost too sick to even come.&nbsp; When we did get to Noche we got a table for 3 (Mails, Miche, and I) and had the hostess take away the fourth chair.&nbsp; This was, it’s girls only, boys can’t come and butt in.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that tactic only worked until Mike and Joel arrived.&nbsp; They quickly pulled up chairs and joined in.&nbsp; Joel seemed a bit distant, but I did not feel a breakup looming.&nbsp; Bruce showed up, but left a moment later with Mike to go watch the Red Socks play.&nbsp; The girls, Joel and I finished up our food and headed inside to the bar.&nbsp; That’s where things got rowdy.   So I wasn't the only one giving  urlLink Michele  some lovin... urlLink Blair  showed up to put the hard press on Mich.&nbsp; He’s so cute, but his persistence is becoming a bit overwhelming.&nbsp; Just as we were beginning to enjoy ourself (get drunk) and flirt with the cute boys, who walks in – Chris.&nbsp; POS!&nbsp; I had no problem telling him exactly what was on my mind.&nbsp; He hung his head, asked if we could be friends and listed to me explain that there is absolutely no excuse for his flakiness and flightiness.&nbsp; I told him I wasn’t interested in hanging out with someone who doesn’t follow through on what they say.&nbsp; He and his cheap ass suit walked off and left me to play with my  urlLink real friends .&nbsp; After coming back for two more rounds of beatings, he finally got the point and said he hopes that I will be his friend and that we can hang out next time I’m at Noche… yeah right.   Oh…so where was Mailee during all this???&nbsp; Yes, she left with Joel.&nbsp; Apparently, they discussed everything on the car ride home and agreed they are equally infatuated with one another.&nbsp; They want to see each other more seriously and bask in their twiterpatedness.&nbsp; Gag… I guess she forgot that ‘boys suck, and that’s sad.’

       Crazy...  ALL NIGHT LONG   &nbsp; &nbsp;   urlLink   &nbsp;      It started out normal enough... Loca Luna.&nbsp; Is that ever normal?&nbsp; No...we know what Loca Luna means - it means we are getting CRAZY ALL NIGHT LONG.&nbsp; Who are these  urlLink people ?&nbsp; All I know is that when Joy heard " urlLink CEO " she bolted to his side and stayed glued there.&nbsp; It was nice running into  urlLink Pilar and Diego , though I think they thought we were a bit out of control.&nbsp; Oh well...   We caught a  urlLink ride  of our CEO and his minions to Formosa (?) where we thought we could party the night away... wrong - it closed at 3:30a.&nbsp; However, we did get to spend some quality time with our beefy bartender.   We got a little bit desperate when we were kicked out of Formosa...&nbsp; had to immediately make some calls to find the after hours joint.&nbsp; Called Mike D to get party line number...&nbsp;&nbsp; talked to Dan.&nbsp; Don't know who he was, but he put me in touch with Wayne.&nbsp; Apparently Wayne has a penthouse pad on Peachtree where we could party till the break of dawn... which is exactly what we did.&nbsp; But first there was one problem…   How do we get there?&nbsp; Hitch-hike of course!&nbsp; So into the car I get with  urlLink London  and his buddy.&nbsp; Holy moly, what was I thinking.&nbsp; Right away I asked London whether he was going to rape me and cut me into small pieces…&nbsp; NO.&nbsp; Joy and Mailee weren’t so sure, however, so they pulled me out of London’s car and into the Ford Taurus driven by a gay guy.&nbsp; For some reason they felt that the  urlLink Gay Taurus man  was safer than the big black dude in the pimpin Mercedes.&nbsp; So off to 171 Peachtree we go…&nbsp;&nbsp; with London following.   Buzzed up…&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp; Who the hell rents out a damn penthouse and has no furniture or anything but rugs and a desk?&nbsp; Weirdos, that's who!&nbsp; Weirdos who pass out random drugged (?) tattoos and want to have threesomes or foursomes with us.&nbsp; We hung out on the rooftop deck and I got in a fight with some random quack about sex… whether it is for procreation or pleasure.&nbsp; I actually polled everyone there to see what their last experience had been for… let’s just say they tended to agree with me – pleasure.   Anyhoo…&nbsp; we managed to get Mr. Masochist to take us home.&nbsp; I went to my bed and Joy and Mailee went back to Michele’s.&nbsp; They managed to stay up till noon the next day, whereas I went to bed about 7:00am.&nbsp; Dad called at 8:30a ready to go shopping.&nbsp; At 9 I rolled up and met him at the damn Pride of Dixie Antique Fair.&nbsp; Hell of a day… shopped till I dropped, napped then saw Madonna.&nbsp; Whoa.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   See more pics  urlLink here .
