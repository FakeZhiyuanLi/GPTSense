      Now, come on people, get real.  Are we actually going to fall for this crap?  So far we've lost about 700 American lives over in Iraq, and we're worried about how some of our troops treat Iraqi prisoners? Maybe if we start treating some of our prisoners here at home this way, people will think twice about committing a crime and going to jail.  The soldiers involved in this so called scandal are posted all over the internet as criminals, meanwhile, the half-wit, common everyday brainwashed citizen, tuned in to his 6 'o'clock news program is going to start believing that treating an Iraqi prisoner of war is an atrocity.  Just a couple days ago, Nicholas Berg was beheaded on video for the world to see, but as the media does its usual number of making mountains of mole-hills, forget that a young man was wrongly executed by Iraqi militants, we're fussing over war criminals being treated unfairly.  If you want to go back in time real quick to WWII, and study how unfairly the Germans treated their prisoners.  I rest my case...  Anyway,  Bear in mind that, in comparison, the U.S. treats it's prisoners like royalty compared to how some foreign countries have treated their prisoners.  It's no wonder why there's chaos over there.  Those people don't fear us, and they never will.  In many cases our soldiers can't fire even if fired upon.  If those people knew for one moment, that our soldiers would publicly behead anyone tearing through a military post or blockade, or anyone shooting at an American soldier, the chaos would end.  Again, I cannot emphasize enough, that I don't think we should be over there, but... We're being shot at, and being humiliated, and I just think we should start taking names and kicking some butt. urlLink   urlLink

      Iraqis enjoy new freedom of expression: "'We suffered for years under Saddam Hussein, not being able to speak out,' says Omar Fadhil, 24, a dentist. 'Now, you can make your voice heard around the world.'"  Ya know, I don't believe our soldiers should be over there in Iraq right now, their agendas are none of our business. Ok, a nation of oppressed people now have the freedom to speak out, but now they are using their new freedom to shoot at our soldiers.  Maybe we shouldn't be over there, but we are, so...I think that anyone who has the nerve to shoot at our soldiers should be quickly united with God, using nothing short of some heavy high tech piece of weaponry.  Anyway, good old Bush #2 is playing the part of both God and General like his papa did, moving his little pieces across the board.  His Agendas are wrong and his intentions are wrong.  The bottom line is, he's being driven by the oldest concept in the book, the good old $$$$. He's trying to promote patriotism, peace, and a new awareness to terrorism.  Well guy, you can't promote patriotism when you propose bills that want to cut overtime, jackass!!!  Oh, that'll really stimulate the economy...Not!  Let's see, if I lose overtime I'll be losing $7000 a year.  heh, Maybe I should go out and buy that new Corvette I've always wanted.  On top of it all, Bush isn't doing a darn thing about jobs going overseas, as a matter of fact, the US government plans to outsource 850,000 jobs.  Good work guys, all those war veterans who put their life on the line feel really appreciated right about now.

      It was a pretty rough day today at work.  Since this is a public blog I won't say where I work, but I'll say it's in the IT area.  We have over 1800 servers of mixed breed of course, SUN, HP Compaq, and DELL.  And we have about 28 mainframes, each of which supporting a variety of businesses.  Enough of the smalltalk.  Today it seemed that everything that could go wrong, did.  I dunno, we must have some environmental issues or something, because it seems that tons of hardware failed.  Most likely users breaking their systems as usual.  As they say in the IT world, the user is the most dangerous part of a computer system.  If it aint bad enough that the hardware is failing, we at the command center are the middleman and have to contact the users of these systems and coordinate downtimes and stuff to replace hardware.  Gosh, these guys are dense, they want things done yesterday, but their managers won't front the bill for vendor support contracts for these systems. On top of all this, we gotta deal with this stuff for 12 hours, many times not even a break....ehhhhhhh

      Ok...All of us who have/had IT jobs have heard or dealt with outsourcing.  You know what I mean?  You own a DELL computer, but are having problems.  So, you call their support center for help with your retractable "cup-holder", and you get a guy on the line named Vishwanatha from Hyderabad India, who can't spell DELL, much less help you with your CD-ROM.  He costs 10 dollars a day and saves Dell or GE, or any large company the costs of benefits, wages, and even time.  Working in IT, I know the real facts about outsourcing and its successes.  First and foremost; success and outsourcing can't be used in the same sentence, perhaps not even in the same paragraph.  Most insourced people calling into my datacenter have admitted to rather having their problem sit and rot in hell, then have to call India for help.  CEO's, Six Sigma number crunchers, and middle uselessness(I mean management) all see the bottom line, $$$$$$$'s.  They don't see the fact that for every 10 calls to the outsourced helpdesk, 6 callers probably wish they hadn't.  Their problem wasn't solved, their language wasn't understood, and their needs simply weren't met.  Management actually believes that money is being saved, but time is money.  Every minute a customer spends calling our datacenter for problems, which is solved in a few moments; some other poor soul is spending upwards at around 10 minutes with some "boob" in India for a similar problem. But....nobody wants to see the hard facts, because management is lining their pockets with raises and bonuses everytime they save a few bucks cutting an American job.  Everytime a little bit of money is spent, our managers cringe as if the money were coming out of their very own pockets.  Why don't these guys grow a "pair" and tell their bosses that it takes money to save money.  Just the other day, we hired a new intern, and part of a new hire process is taking the guy out to lunch or dinner.  We decided to make a team affair out of it and order a few pizzas for everyone.  The bill ended up being $47.  We were bent over and spanked for this(not literally), and reminded that we are cutting costs.  Now, how many situations can you feed 16 people,and the bill be under $50? These people are ridiculous!!! Other the other hand, these same tightwads will ship 8 Indians over here, and treat them all to a Red's Game with seating behind home plate mind you, and a nice dinner, and allow them to have full expenses paid dining and lodging the whole time here.  It's 7am, and I'm already up and ready to kick some arse... GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!   more to come on that subject.

      Ok...here it goes. This is my first entry so bear with me. I chose ‘theironbrigade’ because I love history, specifically American History.  You Civil War buffs out there really know what I’m talking about when I mention the Iron Brigade :) Anyway… on with some of my political views.  I am a proud believer in the 2nd amendment and the rights therein. See?, my first politically incorrect statement, DEAL WITH IT!!! I am a gun owner, and believe that Americans should educate themselves further in their use and purpose. An oppressive government seeks to un-educate, and even brainwash people into thinking that guns are evil, are only used for bad purposes , and only bad people carry them. The proof in that statement resides in the Press’ Media) use of negative connotation when presenting crimes involving use of a gun. We don't see many cases of people killing with a sledgehammer, an ice-pick or a knife. Statistics prove that far more people are killed annually by drunk driving than with firearms. Just on the news the other day, the local news did a report on a gang bust. The guns taken from the felons were normal everyday firearms that any law-abiding citizen can purchase at their local gun store. The media decided to use inflammatory words and illustrations to describe the availability of these weapons. In this case, the weapons used were a 9mm Glock and tactical flashlight, fairly ordinary items sold at a gun store. The Media claimed that these weapons were only for law enforcement use, and were really only available to law enforcement individuals. Now... two false ideas have been conveyed to the general overly sensitive and brainwashed public here. One, guns are bad and are only used by felons. Two, these types of guns can only be gotten by law enforcement individuals, and the general public has no purpose or business purchasing such weapons to defend themselves. Many local governments actually believe and profess that the public should rely on police as their sole means of defense. I don't know about you, but when someone breaks down my door in the middle of the night, I may not have time to wait for the police arrive. Ok, I've put in my two cents worth. Since my blog is going to be politically oriented, I guess that means I'll have to start doing my homework....heh

      This entry is for my good friends Sam and Amanda, who will totally understand the stupidity of the situation, and really get a kick out of it at the same time.  This scenario is involving an ATM machine, and a friend of a friend of mine, to remain nameless of course, to protect the life of this stupid individual.  This girl was traveling among friends and needed some cash, and asked to stop at a local ATM machine.  As most of us know, the ATM will ask for a PIN, then a transaction type, and if asking for a withdrawal, will ask for an amount.  There are some people who are just totally lost at this point.  The machine states in plain English, you must enter an amount in $X increments,X being 5, 10, and even 20.  This particular machine happened to allow $5 increments, meaning you can withdraw $20 and get 4 - 5 dollar bills.  This particular nameless individual, who also happened to be blonde, took the statement to mean that one can only take $5 out at a time.  Here's the dilemma, the girl needed $50. She proceeded to swipe her card, go through the motions and remove $5 from the machine with a transaction fee of $1.50 because the ATM was not of her bank. She proceeded to repeat this mundane task another 9 times, thus adding up to $50 withdrawn and about $15 in transaction fees, not to mention her own bank may charge a dollar or two on top of that.  After hearing this story, which by the way happens to be totally true,I didn't know whether to laugh hysterically or pass out in total amazement.

      It's a very hard decision ya know?  Do we or do we not give the government more control over our lives?  After reading some of the opinions of the public regarding indecent behavior on network TV, I'm begining to think that Americans get dumber and dumber every day.  Well, with me being the anti-government-control person I am, I do feel a need for the government to take a little control here.  The old "change the channel if you don't like what your watchin'" routine doesn't work for me.  Network TV is supposed to be aimed at a general viewing audience, meaning everyone between the ages of 2 to 100 should be able to sit down and watch. Granted, much younger audiences are very limited to their viewing content simply because the subject matter is way over their head, or the material may be too scary or shocking to them.  For example, some news programs while showing a story on a particular type of surgery may show video clips or photos of that particular medical procedure in progress.  It's not that this material is lewd, or indecent, it's simply not understood by a very young audience, and could possible scare them or shock them.  At which point the addition of a parent or legal gaurdian to the scene can educate them, or prevent them from viewing at that particular time.  There are certain moral codes that all creeds, religions, races, and cultures can come to agree on at one point or another.  Many of these moral codes may include laws or reservations against violence on TV, public display of sexual immoraility/provacation, and use of profanity.  In my opinion, network TV needs to be controlled to a point where all programming is decent and acceptable for all audiences, with exception to the above stated regarding younger audiences.  Children are not always under supervision, and even so, are not always under supervision of a competent adult.  Nothing can stop a un-supervised child from flipping through the channels and seeing Janet Jackson show off her chest during the superbowl.  That content is simply not suited for network TV.  If you own a TV, you have no choice but to pick up the network stations, but cable can be controlled and even removed, so why must this garbage content be broadcast on the only stations some of us may be able to pick up?   The change needs to not only include sensorship from the 'home front', but from the broadcasting stations that the garbage is being transmitted from.  As far as heavy fines for an offense, in many cases the offender is only slapped on the wrist.  Penalties need to include being taken off the air, and being subject to public persecution and boycott.  If there's no audience, theres no tv-show, simple as that.

      Ok folks, bare with me here, I'm playing with a new template in an attempt to spice this blog stuff up a little bit.  I'm not very creative with clipart thingies or quaint little designs, so I'll have to play with what blogspot has to offer me.

      Hello again, after much time reflecting over the minor and not so minor annoyances of my computer job, I've come up with a list of what may be the most common traits of an individual who has no idea what they are doing when using a computer, or mainframes for that matter...  1.  You double-click hyperlinks...ewwwww(I can't stand that), and wonder why 2 windows pop up instead of 1. 2. You think your pc needs an upgrade, when you can't browse the internet quick enough 3. You think that your games and programs and OS are on memory(not your hard drive) 4. You think your hard drive is your whole pc 5  When asked what OS you are running, you say....ehhhhh, Pentium II? 6. The concept of burning CD's is a novel idea 7. The sole purpose of the internet is to check email and chat, oh and download MP3's from Napster(soooo, 20th century) 8. You install programs on the root of drive C: (ex. c:\ instead of c:\program files 9.  You have tons of files and text files cluttering your desktop instead of placing them in My Documents or on a separate folder.  10. One of my faves - You have 15 programs set to start up when Windows starts and wonder why your pc is slow...hmmmmmmmm  --------------------------------------  Actual conversations held between Indian customer and the command center  India: "My job isn't running on the system, please help"  Command Center: "The system is in process of being shutdown then IPL'd (process by which we shut down the system then start it back up)for scheduled weekend activity.  India: "But my job is not running"  Command Center:  "The mainframe is down, no jobs can run"  India: "How do I get my job to run then?"    Command Center:  "When the system is back up, we will contact you.  You're job will then run"  India: "Ok, but this is urgent"  Command Center: "There is a 2 hour outage for this activity, please wait until it is complete"  India: "Ok, please hurry, this is urgent"  Command Center: "Bye"  ------------------------------------------------------  As stated in a past blog, users are the most dangerous part of a computer system.

      Howdy, it's been a while.  Between work and my girlfriend(not complaining), there's not much time left to work with, besides those late nights playing Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.  Anyway, had to throw a twist in my usual number of starting my blog entry with a gripe, but don't get used to that.  Just had to try something different.  Today's tidbit of annoyance:  I'm getting tired of all those Linux folks out there, begging, pleeing, and poundin' their Linux Bible's saying that their operating system is the best, and can do everything you want to do that Windows does, but only better.  Yea, I'll agree, that Linux is a very stable operating system.  I'm very versatile in the computer world, with a very good working knowledge of computer hardware, and operating systems.  I've started with shootin' off commands in DOS 5.0, when you actually had to work to use your computer.  There was no internet, no pretty graphics or big hard drives to download gigs of MP3's.  We had two floppy drives, and a 20 megabyte hard drive if we were lucky. You heard me correctly, a 20mb hard drive, roughly the space contained on 14 3.5" floppy disks.  Anyway, with my brood knowledge of computer technology and operating systems, I've struggled to use Linux.  I'll admit, I'm a lazy computer user, a power user mind you, but a lazy one.  I find it ridiculous to re-compile the Kernel(core of the operating system) every time a hardware config, add/remove, or change is done.  In Windows, you turn off the system, add/remove the hardware, and power back up.  Windows finds it, and you're on your way.  If Windows has the drivers built in, great!  If not, your in for a slight annoyance, but nothing like recompiling a kernel.  To go back in time once again, we'll step back to the days of Windows 3.1, when there was no plug 'n play, which is a term long forgotten because plug 'n play has been around since Windows 95.  In Windows 3.1, you had to add the hardware and install the drivers and hope all works well, but again, no re-compiling of a kernel.  Don't get me wrong, maybe compiling a kernel isn't hard at all, but the term in itself sends herds of folks grabbing for Windows XP.  I've used Linux, and it's "Windows" type interface is neat, but lacks the luster of a Windows environment, and could use some methods for easier navigation.  Sure, Linux can do everything that Windows does, but doesn't often come straight out of the box with the ability to do so.  In many cases you gotta spend time online with various support forums to get answers on how to get some program to install and function correctly on your Linux box.  I hate installing a program like Netscape or an AIM type software only to find out that each program specifies its own directories it installs to, confusing things more.  In Linux, I don't think, by default has no "program files" type folder to install all your programs to, very annoying!!!  So now you have software spread all over the system, using disk space you can't keep track of.  Now with Red Hat, there's a thing called RPM(RedHat package manager) that will automatically install/de-install software, that's nothing new, Windows has been doing that for a while.  Let us say MSI(Microsoft Installer), it will by default, if you like, install to the program files directory, and if you don't want the program on your PC anymore,it can automatically remove the files from your computer. Whether your a programmer or not, Linux comes with tons of software that even a professional will never use.  If you do a install of Linux with everything, you can be above 4 gigs of HD space, but that is customizable.  The bottom line is, Linux is a great operating system based on Unix, with mostly the same commands, and interface, with an exception to some new tools.  The real operating system lies underneath the GUI, with a powerful DOS type interface that will let you do more than you would ever want to do in your lifetime, much more than you could ever do with DOS.  Linux however is not user friendly and is not recommended for a new user, or a amateur user, simply because everything you'll ever need is built into Windows 2000 or XP Pro.  Conclusion, if Linux were the best, Bill Gates would be out of business, and I'd be wearing a T-Shirt that says "Got Root?".  But there's a group of fanatics out there that claim Linux is the best, it can do whatever Windows does and even better.  But when all you have is time to sit in front of your PC and edit scripts, compile/rebuild kernels, and stand on street corners bashing Bill Gates, you just have too much time on your hands.  A lot of you folks have personal vendeta's against Microsoft and Bill Gates, and some of you are disillusioned and feel that they've been cheated or scammed somehow, or even lied to.  This isn't the Matrix people, come on.  Some people just have to be different, stubborn to the point where they are willing to miss out on tons of useful and fun to use software, because "Linux is better".  Not much commercial software is compatible with Linux, but there's this buggy program called "wine" that will allow the installation of some Windows programs, but....  Face it Linux people, your world isn't going to take over, Linux won't be the "end all", and I won't be hanging that poster on my wall with that ridiculous map of the Linux Kernel.  If you just want to install software, and just run the darn computer with no hassle, Windows is for you.  Windows is just about as stable now, with Windows XP and 2000 using the same stable NT kernel.  Maybe Windows doesn't stay up as long, but people are doing far more on their Windows boxes than they are on a Linux one. There's more software available for installation that can hang a system and eat up valuable system resources.  After much server experience, I noticed that NT systems are much more robust in the situation of crashes and such. You can walk up to a big Compaq server with 8 Pentium 4 processors and 16 gigs of ram with a huge Oracle database and just yank the plug.  Now, just do the usual number of waiting about 10 sec to allow the HD's to spin down, and power it back up.  when the system is almost all the way up, you'll automatically run scandisk and before you know it, customers are logged back in.  This is certainly not the case with a UNIX/Linux box, just too much sensative stuff going on under the hood that gets corrupted and lost during a hard shutdown.  I work in the IT field and see more SUN servers crash than Compaq NT's or Dells.  But if you truely want stability and uptime, you'll go with OS/390/MVS, or now known as Z/OS, but it's very expensive and requires a person with lots of patience and a good working knowledge of mainframe terminology, programming and hardware.  Uptime with these guys is measured in years, and handle most common business applications in use today.  There are no system panics, crashes, blue screens, users eating processor(not for long anyway), and file systems being filled up.  The comman misconception that mainframes are going away is a fallacy, and as a matter of fact, most servers are adopting methods and similar functions that mainframes have been using for almost 4 decades now.  Whewwww, I didn't mean to make this a computer lesson or lecture, but I just wanted to set some things straight.  Enjoy, and I hope you chose your operating system wisely.
