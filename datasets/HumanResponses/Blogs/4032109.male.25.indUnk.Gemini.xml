        Adding to the log below: The Indians won in a thriller of a game against the SriLankans. The game was almost won by the Lankans as the Indians pulled it out in the last three overs after getting the wicket of Jayasurya who played a classy knock of 130. The Indians play the Lankans on Aug 1 in the finals of Asia Cup 2004. I am sure that India will win this contest with ease.   Score Card

       I canâ€™t believe India lost their match against Pakistan in such tame fashion. The game was almost lost once Pakis made 300 but the Indians could at least have made a better fight of it with their much acclaimed batting line-up. I believe the turning point was the wicket of Rahul Dravid at the early stage of the game. The Indians now have to beat the hosts to get into the final eliminating Pakistan and even though I know that this is going to happen, it would have been nice if India had won this match and kicked Pakistan (No Offence intended) out.    urlLink Score Card

         Hi,          This is my first blog posting on the net. I had this idea of starting a blog for some time now and here I am posting my first scribble on the net. I hope to come with a better and regular blog soon. But don't expect it to be a serious one. It will be just a few scribbles on my past, present and future.  However, I have been maintaing a site of my own for some time now and if you are interested you may check out my site    www.sooraj.cjb.net   .        Have a Nice Time,   Sooraj.

         The Indian cricket team strives hard makes sure that thier fans are always disappointed at the end of a series. How else could you explain the poor show in the finals Of the Asia Cup and the previous many other occasions. As a cricket enthusiast I always get this disappointment and I am quite used to this. So I have decided that in future I will  scribble  less on cricket and try not to pass the disappoinment on to you...     There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere. - Jane Austen
