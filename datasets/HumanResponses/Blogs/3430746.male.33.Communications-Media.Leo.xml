      Last night I went home very broke. I had no money on me, except aproximatley US$2! I ate what the wife had prepared and went to bed. She joined me and asked what was wrong, as I had said very little. Told her about the state of my pockets. She was sympathetic, and gave me some dough for today's lunch and bus fare. She is just great this woman. Big deal, though, is the fact that I spent all the money I had on two broads, my co-workers, actually, on Tuesday and Wednesday. They took me to some expensive joint where I spent the equivalent of half my one-moth's rent buying them tots of whiskey. I stuck to my Tusker Malt Lager. anyway, I'm hopping for a boom soon. Today, I went shopping for a television. The one I have is kinda old,  I bought it last year and it is not a flat screen. I visited five shops along Luthuli Avenue, where they sell electronics at bargain prices. I was shocked when I was shown two versions of Sony Trinitrons (25 inch). "This is imitation and this is original," the Indian shopkeeper. The difference in price was Kenya shillings 10,000 (US$126), which kinda turned me off. I went to a Sony showroom and settled on one Sony that set me back Kenya shillings 30,000 (US$ 380). I hope it will serve me well. I can't wait to knock off work to go test it...

      I cant ever seem to understand her, my wife. She just got up yesterday and said she would visit her friend, girl friend, for two days. Just like that, I mean no warning or anything, she just packed a small bag and took off in the morning. I slept on my own, for the first time in a long time. Bed was cold as hell, I got up in the milddle of the night and went to a neighbourhood pub for a beer. One of the barmaids started getting cozy with me, almost fell for it, she actually gave me a hard on, she noticed it and even touched it. She is not beautiful, so I let her go. Maybe next time I'll take her to a cheap lodging and fuck the hell out of her.... Went back to bed and slept. Woke up with a hard on and wished she, my wife, was here. It is not good wasting a hard on by going to pee!

      I am an African guy who works in an African office somewhere in Nairobi. I'll be telling you about life in this city and why I really like it here. I am married, have several girlfriends (it is no big deal here, just like it is no big deal anywhere else in the world, I guess). Wanna talk to me? My e-mail is wunyokiya@yahoo.co.uk, but read me first.
