      I find myself still thinking of you, every time I blink my eyes....I'm so scared.  I don't know if this is what I want, but there you are..right there. My mind keeps taking me to that night, lighting, thunder and gentle rain.  You kissing me, making all the others melt away...I still remember your smell, your gentle touch. I find myself taking deep breaths, just for lack of air, you make my heart jump and I can actually feel every second tick by just because I am not with you. I am scared not only because I don't want to fall in love, I don't want to hurt but because I am scared if I do fall in love w/ you, I hate the thought of our mortality.  I nestle my face into my pillow searching for the smell of you where you laid. there is a sadness that clouds my mind and I find it hard to concentrate and a dash of confusion. I want you. I miss you.

      Ode to my heart the start of inspiration, the fire and desire that yerns for your body.  Intoxicating to the soul, my lust grown for you even more... my eyes tempted by that satin soft hip of yours.  You the solution to my vast equation. The luxurious dream i breath you in. Let's shatter that chain of separation and tie my vine to you.  That vine filled with intoxicating heat burning with desire for you.  Soon my darling you will be in my arms.  My tongue will be gliding across your belly leading me to that warm sweetly filled place. Close your eyes and crush em' tight.  Here i come, massage the silloute of my soul with thine heart, feel my river flow. Come on honey, let's go! A time for inspiration.

      You've change, your sweet memory long forgotten.  The body that was once yours, buried and rotton. Morbid and done, your soul moved on.  On to explore eternity.  Soaring in splender, drowning above. Going, leaving me all to see. The one I love gone to be, lost I am with out thee.  Shallow the wave my heart's forgotten, my eyes blink to thee. I'll hide behind the moon, quietly, patiently waiting to see, if you, if you will notice me. Me, who has come to join you in our destiny.  So when you arrive and I am there, it will reveal in love again. Again in love with you.

      There is a certain silence today. Morning breaks and the trees sway in the wind. My solitude is my close friend that I have become so familiar with.    This despair an inspiration for the untangible love.  Bright eyes, satin hair.  Rosebud lips, you don't care. In my mind your are there.  Holding me, breathing with me, touching me...lust desire is playing solitaire. Hold my hand, cool to the touch, relizing the death that is there.  Come fly with me, let's breath in the stars. Let's dance among mars. Try me once and never forget, for my love my darling will never rest. But, this revolution my eyes do see, tangled and toiled in memories. Gone for tomorrow came yesterday and today lies forever. So take me my darling, to that special place, where our minds soar above the heavens with your embace.  I love You.

      Last night I came home from work to my daughter, bright eyed and cheery I kissed my little niece good bye.  I then traveled thru my odd angled home to find myself carried to my lush back yard.  There my mother was washing our old pup that had been yelping and whimpering through the night.  I proceeded to the poor rag-a-muffin and squatted next to her, I then rolled her over on to her back.  Her belly swelled and she make little sqeaking noises, I began to rub the animals' belly to see if I could sooth her in any way.  My mother was under the impression that she just had a bad case of constipation.  As I continued to rub the little pup's belly I began to see her fur move in a funny fashion. As my head got closer to see what it was that made the fur move, my eyes captured hundreds of white worm like maggots toiling and trampling over themselves.  A deep chill struck my body and my stomach fliped and squeezed.  "Mom! There's maggots! THERE'S MAGGOTS!" That was it. I immediatly wrapped Sabrina in a old robe I had and put her in a large Dell Computer box.  I then rushed her to the emergency pet hospital and she was seen quickly by the doctor. As I waited on the hard cold banco's build for visitor's I gazed out the window looking out at the grey and silvery sky.  My mind torn at the thought of putting down this 105 year old pup (approx. 15 years of age real time.)  Not so much at the thought of her being very old, with one eye, pathetic and ragged, but the thought of me, I the one to make the final decision to close the animals' heart down.  It was time again, i proceeded to the examination room and it was there the doc gave me the news.....i could either fork over 600 bones with a 30% chance that she might live or put her down.  I had touble saying it, but the doctor could see it in my face, plainly and true the turmoil, the confusion and saddness that filled my eyes.  It was decided then and there, the life of the pup had to go.  The doc left the room. I held sabrina in my arms wrapped in a towel. There she still moaned and whimpered. I caressed her little face and hummed to her. The  doc came back in with two needles filled with the poison. The dog gave a little sweak and with in seconds her little pink tounge that was peeking out of her petite mouth turn a sudden death of grey.  That was when I burst into tears. The pup breathed no more.

      The sun kissed the earth and my heart shattered. My lust, my soul, my darkness without you.  You who light up the rainy night. You the vision of my life. You the one I see when I close my eyes.  You the one I taste your smell. You the one, the one I miss.
