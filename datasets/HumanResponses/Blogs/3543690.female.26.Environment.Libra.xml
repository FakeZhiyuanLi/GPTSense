      Busy weekend here.  Saw Fahrenheit 9-11 last night and anybody who is questioning Bushy at all NEEDS to see this movie.  Republicans can call liberals "un-patriotic" all they want, but this movie just screams "patriotism".  It was funny and yet sad, tragic almost.  Cried through half of it- I don't always buy everything that comes out of Moore's mouth, but this movie just got me all fired up again.  I was going to go home and protest the war in my front yard, but alas, it was dark and I probably would have been egged.  :) Marched in the Chicago gay pride parade today for Barack Obama.  Straight, gay, we were all out in full force.  Obama!  Oh, and got drunk in a hot tub.  Has nothing to with politics though.

      Could the Republican self-destruct any faster?  It seems that at every turn, another mistake is made, most recently and humorously, Cheney dropped the f-bomb on Patrick Leahy on the Senate floor.  With that kind of rage, I'm surprised he hasn't had another heart attack.   In Illinois, Jack Ryan apparently fancies live sex shows.  Namely, with his ex-wife, who refused.  His divorce papers were unsealed this week and on a side note, in Cook County (Chicago) there were approximately 45,000 divorce files, 8 of which were sealed last year.  That probably should have been a BIG indicator that Mr. Ryan was hiding something.  Is the Illinois Republican Party that naive to believe that there was nothing that would "embarrass" them in it?  They are now calling for him to drop out of the race, now that Mr. Fatty Hastert has finally spoken up about it.  Who would they replace him with?  Steve Rauschenburger?  There's a neo-con for ya!  I don't see Barack Obama getting beat in November's election, no matter who the conservatives try to replace super-pimp with.  Oh, going to go see Fahrenheit 9-11 this weekend (if they allow it to be played in Kane County).  I'll let you know how it is, especially since Michael Moore annoys me.  In Illinois, a Star Prepares  WASHINGTON POST COLUMN (Also Appears in the Peoria Journal Star)  By E. J. Dionne Jr.  Friday, June 25, 2004; Page A29   CHICAGO -- Who is Barack Obama, and why is everybody talking about him?   Well, not quite everybody -- yet. But if there is a media darling in this year's election, it is the 42-year-old Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate from Illinois. Obama has been the subject of sympathetic profiles in the New Yorker and the New Republic, and more national attention is on its way. Already there's speculation that he may be the first African American president of the United States -- and he's only a state senator.   If you wanted to be cynical, you would accuse journalists of falling for the too-perfect story line about the biracial son of a Kenyan father and an American mother. His dad disappears from his life when he is 2. He graduates from Columbia University and then works as a community organizer. He goes to Harvard Law School, where he's the first black president of the Law Review.   He gets elected to the Illinois state Senate, then loses a primary for a U.S. House seat. He stays at it, reaches for the big time and wins a sweeping victory in this year's Senate primary. He gets a big vote even in white wards where what's left of the legendary Democratic machine was, in theory at least, pushing for a candidate of its own.   Oh, yes, and he's a dad with two kids, ages 5 and 3. When you sit down with him, his kids are the first thing he wants to talk about.   But Obama would not be getting the ink and the swoons with only a great bio, or just by being very smart. Brainy guys often lose in politics. His is a political mind that can incorporate the opposition's best arguments into his own -- by way of answering them -- and then take clear and unequivocal positions.   Obama is someone who can make staunchly progressive positions sound moderate by being quietly reasonable. And he breaks with his own side's conventional wisdom not in search of a phony bipartisanship but to advance a stronger critique of the status quo.   When I sat down with him recently, for example, Obama said the Democrats' main argument should not be about "how we lost a certain number of jobs versus how we've now gained a certain number of jobs." Stimulating the economy with huge tax cuts was bound to produce some jobs eventually.   The numbers story can distract from the larger story Democrats need to tell. "Instead of having a set of policies that are equipping people for the globalization of the economy," he says, "we have policies that are accelerating the most destructive trends of the global economy."   "The only way the American economy sustains itself and the middle class is if we're able to train people for high-value-added jobs, and if we have policies that soften the edges" of the competition, including "health care, better child care and better teachers in the schools."   By contrast, the administration's policies -- Obama attributes them to the "Club for Growth philosophy," after the conservative group that loves tax cuts for the rich -- only aggravate inequalities.   But Democrats are reluctant to talk about big things, he says, because they're so fearful that "we'll be labeled tax-and-spend."   For Obama, reasonableness does not translate into timidity. If Democrats worry most about what Republicans will say about them, Obama says, they will be left with "this tepid, tired and rudderless message, one that can't move a lot of ordinary citizens who feel they're grinding it out, day in and day out, and not making any progress."   He frames the basic issue of our politics this way: "We need some balance between community and mutual obligation on the one side and the need for competitiveness and market incentives on the other. The biggest challenge for the Democrats is to articulate a plausible solution to this problem."   Most of the news this past week about the Illinois Senate race focused on the seamy details of the recently released divorce records of Jack Ryan, Obama's wealthy Republican opponent.   Whether or not Ryan survives the revelations, the important story out of this race will be Obama, who already has a big lead in the polls. Is the guy for real? Consider: Obama worked hard in the Illinois legislature to get a bill passed to reform the state's death penalty system. Political opportunists don't challenge the death penalty. Obama is interested in people who are hurting and problems that are serious. That, even more than his biography, is why he'll hit the big time.

      This article is off of BushGreenwatch.org    June 14, 2004 | Back Issues   Bush EPA Stalling on Fuel Economy Standards   While the Bush administration continues to promote a national energy policy favoring more fossil fuel use -- oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, denying widely accepted scientific data on climate change, underwriting oil exploration and drilling in wilderness areas with public tax dollars -- the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is dragging its heels on revisions for tests that determine automobiles' actual miles-per-gallon performance.    The Bluewater Network, a California-based environmental policy organization, petitioned EPA and the Department of Transportation (DOT) in 2002 to update their fuel economy programs, which were initially mandated by Congress in the mid-1970s.    EPA last adjusted its testing methods in 1985. "In today's environment with mounting evidence of global warming, concern about the security implications of our dependence on foreign oil, and relatively high gasoline prices, consumers and policymakers are increasingly taking fuel economy into account. It is vital that they be provided with accurate information on which to base these decisions," Bluewater wrote.    While drivers now spend more time in congested driving conditions due to urban sprawl than in the mid-70s, and drive at faster highway speeds, fuel economy is still calculated based on driving conditions and auto technologies over two decades out of date. According to figures cited in the Bluewater petition, cars are getting 14.5 percent fewer miles per gallon than EPA's estimates, and light trucks 19.3 percent less. These shortfalls are likely to rise over time.    Without updated standards and testing, consumers cannot judge how much they will really spend on gasoline for a new car or truck, or how much carbon dioxide (CO2)—a significant greenhouse gas—a vehicle will emit. Cars and light-duty trucks contribute nearly 20 percent to annual U.S. emissions of CO2 -- roughly five percent of the world's annual CO2 emissions. [1]    Late last year the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (part of DOT) proposed revisions to fuel economy standards, including the creation of new weight classes for current types of cars and trucks. This new system would close a current loophole that exempts certain weights of trucks from fuel economy standards, but it would also establish weaker standards for heavier vehicles. U.S.PIRG notes in a recent report that automobile manufacturers may actually add weight to vehicles in order to avoid the stricter requirements.    "The Bush administration should be looking for ways to save consumers money at the pump and wean us from oil—foreign or domestic—in the long term," U.S.PIRG writes. "Instead of taking advantage of [existing] automobile technology to achieve a 40 mpg standard, the administration is pushing an energy policy that emphasizes the technologies of yesterday and has opposed all meaningful increases in fuel economy." [2]

      Let me just start off saying that I have absolutely nothing against Christians.  The normal ones, anyway.  And by normal, I mean those that realize that faith is something personal, not something to base laws on and not something to use as basis for discrimination and hatred.  Fundamentalists freak me out.  The Bible is not something to be taken 100% literally.  How can any intelligent, thinking person believe that it is?  It does contain a great deal of moral lessons and many stories that have a purpose.  I have no doubt that some of those things actually happened.  It was written by a handful of men 2000 years ago.  I'm pretty sure God didn't sit down at a table and over some coffee dictated the Bible to them.  I'll go ahead and write about my opinions and what I see happening now and you tell me in 2000 how accurate it actually is, after being passed around and rewritten.    This leads me to the topic of gay marriage.  The argument “marriage has always been between a man and a woman and it should stay that way” is ridiculous; along with “they never had the right in the first place and therefore do not deserve it now”.  Times change.  Once upon a time, women couldn’t vote and slavery was legal.  Would you have been one of those people who was against suffrage and the civil rights movement b/c “it has always been this way”?  Here’s an even better idea; let’s go back to the actual “historic” definition of marriage where the woman is the property of the man.  Let our husbands beat us or trade us for a cow.  I mean, that’s how it always was and therefore should have stayed that way, right?    I'm pretty sure that whenever I get married, if my gay friends choose to celebrate their love for one another and gain the legal rights that everyone should be entitled to, that my marriage won't crumble and society won't go into a tailspin directly to hell.  Legal rights- picture this: Your parents have passed away and you have one sibiling who despises the fact that you are living in sin with your partner b/c you didn't (couldn't) marry them, even though you've been together for 40 years.  Your sibiling and you haven't spoken in 30 years and you become deathly ill.  Now, do you want that sibiling to be the one to decide your fate simply b/c you share some blood with them or do you want the person whom you've loved and shared your life with for 40 years to be able to make those decisions?  Duh.  But homosexuals do not have this right.  Only married people do.  Blows my mind.    I was raised to be compassionate and accepting.  Just because you don’t understand something or think it’s wrong, does not give you the right decide what is right and wrong for everyone.  Especially when you’re basing your argument on two lines out of a 2,000-year-old document.  I don’t understand why people drive Hummers, and I think those people are morally corrupt.  But, that does not give me the right to preach to the masses and make laws to ban these monstrosities. Live your life based on what you think is right.  Do not try to live other people’s lives on what you think is right.    I'm going to McDonald's.  Need some crispy chicken.

      Watched the documentary "Winged Migration" tonight.  Highly recommended, but man, that was a depressing movie.  It makes a point to show you the effect humans have on something as simple as migration.    It's quite interesting to read the little literary wars that Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert and Senator Dick Durbin have in the Chicago Tribune.  The latest is about Bush's energy bill.  Hastert wrote first, on June 2nd.  He mentions how Durbin had a chance to help bring gas prices down months ago and didn't.  By this, he means that Durbin was the only senator from one of the five biggest ethanol producing states that voted against the energy bill.  He pretty much blames the current gas prices and the fact that our dependence on foreign oil has risen 10% on Durbin.  Curious, since I'm pretty sure in the energy bill there was no mention of increasing fuel efficiency in cars and eliminating the RIDICULOUS tax break that people get when using Hummers for business.  No, that couldn't have anything to do with our rising gas prices.  Hastert also has the gumption to say that "We can no longer afford to delay action because of partisan game playing in the Senate."  He says that Durbin voted down the bill just to obstruct the Republicans.  Ha.  Durbin counters on June 4th.  As Durbin quotes John McCain (a Republican, by the way) from a speech on the senate floor, "...At a time when it is crucial for our national security and economic welfare that we pursue a new course toward energy independence and global environmental protection, the provisions in this bill take exactly the wrong direction: increasing our dependence on conventional fuels; increasing environmental degradation; increasing our energy use; increasing our national debt and diminishing protection for consumers and public health."  This is NOT Durbin speaking, but one of the most independent Senators from either party.  Durbin points out the MTBE provision in the bill (MTBE is a fuel additive that has contaminated communities in several states).  This provision prevents holding the corporations who were responsible for theses leaks from being prosecuted in any fashion.  Hmmm... wonder who contributes to the Bush campaign.  Durbin also points out that this bill originated with Cheney and oil executives and he went so far as to go to the Supreme Court to avoid disclosing the bill's origins.  Hmmm.  And finally, Bush's own Energy Information Administration said that this bill would have "negligible" effects on the current gas prices.  Gotta love those bull-headed conservatives that have their pockets lined with money from big oil and gas.    More on Hastert and the legacy he wants to curse his own district with, later.

      Well hello there... I've been trying to figure out a way to get my vast expanse of opinions out in the open since they seem to be giving me a rage ulcer.  One can only write so many letters to the editor before people start recognizing your name as "a liberal nutcase" who feels the need to write in about anything and everything.  Actually, when it comes down to it, I don't give a hoot what's going on in the local school systems or what new plans are in the works for the riverfront.  Our political future is in dire straights and it blows my mind how many close minded people there are out there.  I have become much more aware of this over the last couple years since I now live in the county I grew up in, or as I like to call it, Conservative Fundamentalist Central.    Now, I realize that there are some topics that there are grey areas in, but there are some that I cannot comprehend how certain people can think the way they do.  I've tried, I really have... Had many a discussion with neocons and tried to see where they were coming from.    As these rants come into my head (along with anything else that pops up in my brain), I will be posting them here for you to dissect, argue or agree with or ignore.  All I ask is that a level of respect be maintained, and I will provide the same back to you.  Cross the line, and it's a free for all.  :)  Cheers.

      When did “liberal” become a four-letter word? No one wants parents that are conservative with their love. No one applies sunblock conservatively. I am NOT a democrat.  I am a member of no party.  I am a liberal. I am a college-educated woman that believes that I was blessed to be born to a well-off family that could provide my education for me.  This does not entitle me to pretend that there is not poverty in our country.  This does not entitle me to any more privileges than those that work three jobs to provide for their family.  The argument that “I worked hard for my money” is downright ridiculous when it comes from the mouths of wealthy white men.  Are those people who received a poor education that now work 70 hours a week for $8 an hour not working hard?  That attitude is what divides the liberals from the conservatives.  I am an educated member of the middle class, and yet I did not benefit from the tax break.  I will happily give up my $4 a paycheck tax break to help our debt and our poor.  There I go, being “liberal” again.   Before the next election, ask yourself these questions and answer them honestly.  Do you care about the future of our environment and the effects of dirty air and water on your kids and grandkids? Do you feel safe from another terrorist attack when places such as Oregon have one person patrolling its coasts? Do you want your parents/grandparents to be able to have healthcare that does not require cutting pills and organizing dozens of “cards” for their prescriptions? Do you want your children to be sent to a war with no purpose, other than to secure our place in the Middle East?  September 11th caused the economy to crumble.  Bush did not, and I will acknowledge that.  However, putting us in debt by over 7 trillion dollars is unacceptable.  What did this, you ask?  The war in Iraq.  Now, before you get all up in arms about the war and why we are there, let’s review a few points. Reasons given to go to war, in chronological order: Terrorism, gotta defeat it. WMD, need I say more? Saving the Iraqi’s from a brutal dictatorship  Well, the 9/11 commission found no link between Iraq and Al Qaida, so that’s out.  As for the WMD’s, well, that’s a bust.  Now, I understand the idea behind freeing people from a tyrant.  But, why Iraq?  There are countries in Africa with brutal dictatorships (Sudan for example), and how ‘bout North Korea?  They waved their weapons in our face while starving their people.  Hmm…  Stop and think about what we have to gain from invading Iraq.   Don’t write this off as a “liberal-rant”.  Ask yourself why we shouldn’t be responsible for our actions (e.g., not signing the Kyoto protocol) because “the third world countries don’t have to sign it”.  I’m sorry; I didn’t realize that we are on par with a third world country.  If the United States of America is such a world force and a leader, why would we not lead in one of the best ways possible?  Why would our Republican run Senate table bills that would decrease our dependence on Middle Eastern oil?  Why table a bill that would provide funding for alternative fuels?  Check the voting records; they’re all there.  While you’re at it, look into the ties our Department of the Interior to the “industry”, gas, coal, oil, etc.  Look into Cheney’s ties with Halliburton and bills that have been tabled and voted down because they might make companies like that pay for the damage that they do.  Don’t write everything off because it’s coming from someone who may think differently than you.  Ask yourself what kind of "values" our vice president has when he uses profanity on the senate floor toward a senator.  Not being able to see the gray area on complicated topics is not being “strong”, it is being foolish and hardheaded.  Apply that theory to your own life and see how only seeing things in black and white works for you.  Do your research before you vote.  Spend a few hours online looking up things that matter to you and how the candidates stand on those topics.  Do not recite what you hear on commercials.  Educate yourself; it’s your best weapon.

      Wow.&nbsp; What a speech last night by Obama at the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp; Watching that speech made me realize that all it takes is one person to revitalize a party.&nbsp; Well done, Barack.   Ron Regan's speech was also quite eloquent, making the case for stem-cell research.&nbsp; An extra slap in the face for the Republicons is the fact that his mother, Nancy, turned down the opportunity to speak at the Repulican National Convention in August.&nbsp; In the words of Nelson Muntz, "ha-ha".   As for Teresa Heinz Kerry, it was refreshing to see a strong, intelligent woman speaking as the future (hopefully) first lady.&nbsp; I'm tired of seeing cookie-baking, soft-spoken motherly types as political wives.&nbsp; Speak up ladies!&nbsp;&nbsp;Teresa and John Kerry have a different sort of relationship, but not one that is lacking in love and respect.&nbsp;   Anywho, John Edwards speaks tonight.&nbsp; Hopefully he can also show the&nbsp;U.S. what the Democratic ticket has to offer.&nbsp;   And to any of you who just recite what you hear from the conservatives and regurgitate it verbatim, do your research!&nbsp; Actually take some time to learn about the candidates before you make your decision and spout off what you hear from the tv/newspaper/radio.

      The Kane County Fair was this weekend, something that I haven't attended since I was about 13.&nbsp; After entering the front gates, I remembered why...the stank of manure, the animals crowded in small pens, the smell of greasy food and lets not forget, the carnies!&nbsp; However, there was a very bright point to my Saturday, and that was the fact that Barack Obama, Illinois Senate candidate, visited the fair to award the first place ribbon to the best beef steer or something like that.&nbsp;  What a man!&nbsp; I got to meet him, shake his hand and chat a little.&nbsp; He talked to everyone that came up to him and couldn't have been more generous with taking photos with people and signing autographs.&nbsp; He pet all the animals, walked through the piles of manure and smiled the whole time.&nbsp; Not one of those "cheesy politician I'm so fake and perfectly coiffed" smiles, but a genuine one.&nbsp; The photo above is of him and me, I feel like I met a movie star!  Yes, I'm a complete and total political nerd.

      Well, Kerry has his running mate.  Mr. Edwards.  And of course, Bush has already lambasted him for not having any experience.  Hmm... can someone please explain to me how serving six years as a senator is that different than serving six years as a governor?  Of Texas, nonetheless? It's gotten to the point that if you tell me you like Bush and are voting for him, I automatically think of you as dumber than I would have normally.  It's sad, but it's also beyond my comprehension how anyone is still voting for him.  Is it because he believes in God?  Or because he seems to want religion to rule the country?  I ponder this often and still have not some up with any thoughts on why voting for him would be a GOOD thing.    On a different note, Ken Lay was indicted.  Ha ha.

      How sad is this?  The Republicans are now not only contributing money to Nader, but are helping him to get on the ballot in swing states.  In Portland, Oregon, two right-wing groups started phone banks to get fellow Nazi's out to sign Nader's petition to get him on the ballot. What's the matta guys?  Are you that scared your little Bushie won't win the swing states?  Being elected honestly obviously went out the window in the 2000 election (Florida, anyone?).  The conservatives don't seem to have enough "faith" in their candidate to let him win the election on his own merits(?).  If he has any.
