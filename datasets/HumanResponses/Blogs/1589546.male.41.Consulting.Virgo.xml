       urlLink Feature Article: Making the Business Case for E-Learning - 19 Jul 2004  BLU has not yet developed a role in helping the business support community to develop an approach to e-learning.  We have a large number of organisations without the budget to really make e-learning fly.  Is there a role for BLU to help co-ordinate interest groups in the business support world to develop a coherent shared platform for blended learning?  Is such a platform required or can we simply use the learning exchange to signpost to relevant e-learning and leave it to individuals and organisations to make the neccesary investment?
