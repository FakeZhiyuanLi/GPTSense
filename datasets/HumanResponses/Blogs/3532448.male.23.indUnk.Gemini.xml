      From:  "Michael Lee"    Date:  Mon Jun 21, 2004  11:32 am  Subject:  The Rich Man's Wish  THE RICH MAN'S WISH  There was a very rich and selfish man. He had many servants and lived in a very large house.  One day while walking in his beautiful garden he saw a very odd-looking man. This man was not only in his garden, he was floating above it!  The rich man asked the odd man, "Who are you and why are you in my garden?"  The man replied, "I am a genie and I can grant you one wish."  The rich man pondered this. He already had a lot of money and everything he could possibly want. Finally after much consideration, he answered,  I want to know how many people on this world are thinking about me."  The genie answered quickly, "One."  "ONE?" The man was so curious he grabbed the genie, shook him and pleaded, "You must grant me one more wish!." When the genie agreed, the man asked, "Who is that one person?"  The genie cackled and said, "The person who is thinking of you my son,is you." With this, the genie disappeared and left the rich man in deep thought.  In today's world, oftentimes we are just thinking of our own selves and not about the people around us, nor about God. Perhaps if we stop thinking only of our needs and that of our families and listen to what God is telling us, more of our wishes will come true. Let's live for God!

      From:  "Michael Lee"    Date:  Fri Jun 11, 2004  10:18 am  Subject:  Use Your Time Wisely!   Use Your Time Wisely! By: Michael Lee, CPA  When I was small, I have never considered the importance of time. I would just laze around, watch TV, lie in bed, and play video games. As I grew older, I thought about the things that I have achieved. To my surprise, I haven't accomplished a lot.  I resolved to myself that I will do things that will contribute to the benefit of mankind. I studied very hard and learned a lot of lessons from my experience. I lack self-confidence before, so I want to help other people overcome this predicament.  I became obssessed with self-improvement, so I started a newsletter. I'm also working on an ebook about persuasion as I'm writing this. I want to help anyone in need because it feels so good to solve other people's problems.  I urge you now to make the most use of your time. It may be joining a fundraising organization. You may also learn new skills or crafts. Create a goal and go for it!  Don't be a couch potato. Don't just sit around and be contented with the monotonous patterns of your daily activities.  Do something nice and give all your best to the fulfillment of a worthwhile endeavor. It will give you a very deep sense of happiness and satisfaction.  Some people complain that they don't have enough time to take action on their goals. They have to go to their 9 to 5 job, then when they go home they feel so tired all they can think about is watch TV, relax, and sleep.  I'm not saying that leisure is a no-no. In fact, everyone should take time out once in a while to recharge and revitalize their energy. The key is to have a balanced life. Set aside a fraction of your time to carry out your dreams and ambitions. Reserve some time to establish healthy relationships.  Ok, I hear you. You're saying that you really just can't budget your time?  Don't panic. Here are some time management tips.  1) If possible, do more than one thing at the same time.  Exercise while watching your favorite TV show. Listen to educational tapes while waiting for the bus.  Be forewarned! Never do this if it puts you at risk or in danger; for example, don't text while driving.  2) Don't do something later if it can be done concurrently with an activity at present.  If you're going to the market to buy some eggs, think of the other things that you have to purchase so that you don't have to return again.  If you have an appointment with the dentist today and you also have to go to the bank (which is near the dentist's clinic) at any day, schedule the two activities on the same day.  3) Be organized in everything that you do.  Put labels on bottles. Put similar files on one folder. Make a list of things you have to do for the day.  You can also use your mind to organize things you have to remember. Studies have shown that you could only retain information that fit between 5 to 9 categories at a time. This is the 7+-2 rule of Neurolinguistic Programming.  If you have many things to do, try to group related things together. You can combine activities such as reading books, listening to educational tapes, and watching training videos into a category such as "Education." Then you can group swimming, playing basketball, and paying fees for the gym in a category called "Fitness." Get the picture?  Time is one of our most valuable resources. Once lost, it can never be reclaimed. We must use time wisely for our development and advancement; so that when we are old, we can look back and recollect the pleasant memories and deeds that we have achieved. Time well spent is worth much more than gold.

      ========================================= From:  "waqas_anj"    Date:  Thu Jun 10, 2004  1:10 am  Subject:  OUR LIVES IN MONEY =========================================  A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill. In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this $20 bill?" Hands started going up.  He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this." He proceeded to crumple the $20 dollar bill up. He then asked, "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air. "Well", he replied, "What if I do this?" And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. "Now who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air. "My friends, we have all learned a very valuable lesson", he said, "No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20.  Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value. Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless.... and especially to those who love you.  The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or whom we know, but by WHO WE ARE.   "You are special - Don't EVER forget it."

      From:  "waqas_anj"    Date:  Wed Jun 9, 2004  2:09 am  Subject:  Two Brothers    Two Brothers  Once upon a time two brothers, who lived on adjoining farms, fell into conflict. It was the first serious rift in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed without a conflict. Then the long collaboration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence.  One morning there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's tool box. "I'm looking for a few days' work" he said. "Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with? Could I help you?" "Yes," said the older brother. "I do have a job for you."  "Look across the creek at that farm. That's my neighbor; in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow between us and he took his bulldozer to the river levee and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll do him one better."  "See that pile of lumber by the barn? I want you to build me a fence --an 8-foot fence -- so I won't need to see his place or his face anymore."  The carpenter said, "I think I understand the situation. Show me the nails and the post-hole digger and I'll be able to do a job that pleases you."  The older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing. About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job.  The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge -- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work, handrails and all -- and the neighbor, his younger brother, was coming toward them, his hand outstretched. "You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done." The two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand.  They turned to see the carpenter hoist his toolbox onto his shoulder. "No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you," said the older brother. "I'd love to stay on," the carpenter said, but I have many more bridges to build.  Food for Thought:  Do you have any bridges that you need to build?

      From:  "waqas_anj"    Date:  Wed Jun 9, 2004  2:00 am  Subject:  The King's Four Wives      The King's Four Wives  Once upon a time there was a rich king who had four wives. He loved his fourth wife the most and adorned her with riches. He also loved his third wife and was always showing her off to neighboring kingdoms. However, he always feared that she would leave him. His second wife was kind and considerate and his trusted confidante and advisor in difficult times. Wife number one was devoted and loyal and although she loved him deeply, he was not so interested and tended to ignore her.  One day, the king fell ill and knew his time was short. He thought of his luxurious life and feared being alone when he died.  He asked his fourth wife, "I have loved you the most, endowed you with the finest clothing and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?" "No way!" she replied and walked away without another word.  The sad king then asked the third wife, "I have loved you all my life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company? " "No!" she replied. "Life is too good! When you die, I'm going to remarry!".  He then asked the second wife, "I have always turned to you for help and you've always been there for me. When I die, will you follow me and keep me company?" "I'm sorry, I can't help you out this time!" she replied. "At the very most, I can help with your funeral."  Then a voice called out to the king in his sadness: "I'll leave with you and follow you no matter where you go." The king looked up and there was his first wife. She was so skinny and undernourished. Greatly grieved, the king said, "I should have taken much better care of you when I had the chance!"  In truth, we all have four wives in our lives. Our fourth wife is our body. No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look good, it'll leave us when we die. Our third wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, it will all go to others. Our second wife is our family and friends. No matter how much they have been there for us, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave. And our first wife is our soul, often neglected in pursuit of wealth, power and pleasures of the ego. However, our soul is the only thing that will follow us wherever we go.   The moral of the story:  Look after your body and keep it healthy so you can live life to its fullest. Enjoy your possessions and the comfort they provide. Cherish your friends and family and the love they provide. But don't forget to nourish your soul--it is the source of all your life and your most faithful friend.

      ======================================== From:  "waqas_anj"    Date:  Sun Jun 6, 2004  6:28 pm  Subject:  The Most Important Body Part ========================================   My mother used to ask me: "What is the most important part of the body?" Through the years I would take a guess at what I thought was the correct answer. When I was younger, I thought sound was very important to us as humans, so I said, "My ears, Mommy." She said, "No Many people are deaf. But you keep thinking about it and I will ask you again soon." Several years passed before she asked me again. Since making my first attempt, I had contemplated the correct answer. So this time I told her, "Mommy, sight is very important to everybody, so it must be our eyes. She looked at me and told me, "You are learning fast, but the answer is not correct because there are many people who are blind." Stumped again, I continued my quest for knowledge. Over the years, Mother asked me a couple more times and always her answer was, "No, but you are getting smarter every year, my child." Then last year, my grandpa died. Everybody was hurt. Everybody was crying. Even my father cried. I remember that especially because it was only the second time I saw him cry. My Mom looked at me when it was our turn to say our final good-bye to Grandpa. She asked me, "Do you know the most important body part yet, my dear?" I was shocked when she asked me this now. I always thought this was a game between her and me. She saw the confusion on my face and told me, "This question is very important. It shows that you have really lived in your life. For every body part you gave me in the past, I have told you was wrong and I have given you an example why. But today is the day you need to learn this important lesson." She looked down at me as only a mother can. I saw her eyes well up with tears. She said, "My dear, the most important body part is your shoulder." I asked, "Is it because it holds up my head?" She replied, "No, it is because it can hold the head of a friend or a loved one when they cry. Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on sometime in life, my dear. I only hope that you have enough love and friends that you will always have a shoulder to cry on when you need it." Then and there I knew the most important body part is not a selfish one. It is sympathetic to the pain of others. People will forget what you said... People will forget what you did.... But people will NEVER forget how you made them feel.

      ------------------------------------------ From: "waqas_anj"    Date: Sat Jun 5, 2004 2:38am  Subject: A SWEET LOVE STORY   ------------------------------------------  One of the most touching and purest love story I've read in a while..  From the very beginning, girl's family objected strongly on her  dating this guy, saying that it has got to do with family background,  & that the girl will have to suffer for the rest of her life if she  were to be with him.  Due to family's pressure, the couple quarreled very often. Though the  girl loved the guy deeply, she always asked him: "How deep is your  love for me?"  As the guy is not good with his words, this often caused the girl to  be very upset. With that & the family's pressure, the gal often vents  her anger on him. As for him.. he only endured it in silence.  After a couple of years, the guy finally graduated & decided to  further his studies overseas. Before leaving, he proposed to the  gal: "I'm not very good with words. But all I know is that I love  you. If you allow me, I will take care of you for the rest of my  life. As for your family, I'll try my best to talk them round. Will  you marry me?"  The girl agreed, & with the guy's determination, the family finally  gave in & agreed to let them get married. So before he left, they got  engaged.  The gal went out to the working society, whereas the guy was  overseas, continuing his studies. They sent their love through emails  & phone calls. Though it was hard, but both never thought of giving  up.  One day, while the gal was on her way to work, she was knocked down  by a car that lost control. When she woke up, she saw her parents  beside her bed. She realized that she was badly injured. Seeing her  mum cry, she wanted to comfort her. But she realized that all that  could come out of her mouth was just a sigh. She had lost her  voice....  The doctor says that the impact on her brain has caused her to lose  her voice. Listening to her parents' comfort, but with nothing coming  out from her, she broke down. During the stay in hospital, besides  silent cry. it's still just silent cry that accompanied her. Upon  reaching home, everything seems to be the same. Except for the  ringing tone of the phone which pierced into her heart every time it  rang. She does not wish to let the guy know & not wanting to be a  burden to him, she wrote a letter to him saying that she does not  wish to wait any longer.  With that, she sent the ring back to him. In return, the guy sent  millions & millions of reply and countless phone calls. all the gal  could do besides crying is still crying.... The parents decided to  move away, hoping that she could eventually forget everything & be  happy.   With a new environment, the gal learnt sign language & started a new  life.  Telling herself everyday that she must forget the guy. One day, her  friend came & told her that he's back. She asked her friend not to  let him know what happened to her. Since then, there wasn't anymore  news of him.  A year has passed & her friend came with an envelope, containing an  invitation card for the guy's wedding. The gal was shattered. When  she opened the letter, she saw her name on it instead. When she was  about to ask her friend what was going on, she saw the guy standing  in front of her....  He used sign language to tell her, "I've spent a year to learn sign  language. Just to let you know that I've not forgotten our promise.  Let me have the chance to be your voice. I Love You." With that, he  slipped the ring back into her finger. The gal finally smiled......  Treat every relationship as if it's the last one, then you'll know  how to Give.  Treat every moment as if it's the last day, then you'll know how to  Treasure.  Treasure what you have right now, or else you may regret one day...

          by: Michael C. Lee  Once upon a time there was an island where all feelings lived; Hapiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all others including Love. One Day it was announced to all the feelings That the Island was going to sink to the bottom of the ocean So all the feelings prepare their boats to leave. Love was the only one that stayed. She wanted to preserve the island paradise until the last possible moment. When the island was almost totally under, Love decided to leave. She begun looking for someone to ask for help. Just then, Richness was passing by in a grand boat. Love asked, "Richness, can I come with you in your boat". Richness answered "I am sorry, but theres a lot of silver and gold On my boat and there would be no room for you anywhere". The Love decided to ask Vanity, Who was passing by in a beautiful vessel, for help. Love cried out, "Vanity, help me please!" "I cant help you", Vanity said. "You are all wet and will damage my beautiful boat!" Next Love saw sadness passing by. Love said, "Sadness please let me go with you". Sadness answered, "Love im sorry, but i just need to be alone now". Then Love saw Happiness. Love cried out, "Happiness, please take me with you!" but, Happiness was so enjoyed that he didn't hear love calling to him. Love began to cry. Then she heard a voice say, "Come Love, I will take you with me!" It was an elder. Love felt so blessed and enjoyed that she forgot to ask the elders name. When they arrived on land the elder went his way. Love realized how much she owed the elder. Love then found Knowledge and asked, "Who was it that help me?" "It was Time" knowledge answered. "But why did Time help me when no one else would?" Love asked. Knowledge smiled and with deep wisdom and sincerity answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how GREAT LOVE is".

      36 Stress Reducers - I hope it works for YOU! ------------------------------------- 1. Pray 2. Go to bed on time. 3. Get up early so you can start the day unrushed. 4. Say No, to projects that won't fit into your time schedule, or that will compromise your mental health. 5. Delegate tasks to capable others. 6. Simplify and uncluttered your life. 7. Less is more. (Although one is often not enough, two are often too many.) 8. Allow extra time to do things and to get to places. 9. Pace yourself. Spread out big changes and difficult projects over time; don't lump the hard things all together. 10. Take one day at a time. 11. Separate worries from concerns. If a situation is a concern, find out what God would have you to do and let go of the anxiety. If you can't do anything about a situation, forget it. 12. Live within your budget; don't use credit cards for ordinary purchases. 13. Have backups; an extra car key in your wallet, an extra house key buried in the garden, etc., 14. K.M.S. (Keep Mouth Shut.) This single piece of advice can prevent an enormous amount of trouble. 15. Do something for the Kid in You everyday. 16. Carry a bible with you to read while waiting in line. 17. Get enough exercise. 18. Eat right. 19. Get organized so everything has its place. 20. Listen to a tape while driving that can help improve your quality of life. 21. Write thoughts and inspirations down. 22. Everyday, find time to be alone. 23. Having problems? Talk to God on the spot. Try to nip small problems in the bud. Don't wait until its time to go to bed to try and pray. 24. Make friends with Godly people. 25. Keep a folder of favorite scriptures on hand. 26. Remember that the shortest bridge between despair and hope is often a good "Thank you Jesus!" 27. Laugh. 28. Laugh some more! 29. Take your work seriously, but not yourself. 30. Develop a forgiving attitude (just realize that most people are doing the best they can). 31. Be kind to unkind people (they probably need it the most). 32. Sit on your ego. 33. Talk less; listen more. 34. Slow down. 35. Remind yourself that you are not the general manager of the universe. 36. Every night before bed, think of one thing you're grateful for that you've never been grateful for before. ** GOD HAS A WAY OF TURNING THINGS AROUND FOR YOU** Stress is the number one killer in the world today. (Remember how you felt the last time you were stressed?) Reducing stress in your life should become a major priority. Your life depends on it.   by Michael C. Lee

      How many of us live the life of a goldfish? Sounds silly? Not really. Think about it. A goldfish lives in the limited space of his bowl, looking out at the world.  Sad to say, many people live a similar existence, remaining in their safe, limited realms, afraid to reach out in to territories unexplored; especially, the uncharted terrain of relationships. People come in and out of their life, unfazed and untouched by the wonderful gifts that lie deep in store each of us, if only we would take the time to let them be opened.  I'd much rather think that we are called to be as butterflies, opening our wings and letting all men see the beauty that resides in our hearts. In similar manner, when it is dark and we have a candle, do we hide the candle under a rock, or use its light so that others may see?  Just as our talents and gifts of self are to be utilized and shared for the benefit of others, so too, does Christ call us to not hide His good news. This message is that God offers us the gift of salvation which is ours for the taking.  Receive your gift today and don't be a goldfish.   Contributed by Melanie Schurr

      Whether it's your relationships, your career, or anything that's important in your life, you have all the power it takes to be the master of your destiny.  Are You The Master Of Your Destiny? By: Michael Lee, CPA  How strong are you?  I'm not asking if you can carry 150 lbs. of weight. What I'm after is your strength of character. How resilient are you to hang on to your dreams amidst the raging forces of discouragement and criticisms?  There are far too many individuals who never get to experience the joy of attaining their desires because other people's influence has significantly (and sometimes negatively) affected their crucial decisions.  Are there instances in your life when other people said that you should not continue your plans because they're never gonna work? What did you do? Did you continue your endeavors or did you just follow their command?  If you always adhere to other's beliefs and opinions even though they are contrary to yours, you're just torturing yourself. It's like you don't have a mind of your own. You're like a shadow following the moves of someone else.  You may listen to other people's advices, but never let them control you. If their advices would contribute to your success and well being, then by all means follow them. But if they would hinder you and stray you away from what you really want in life, then you've got to make a stand and pursue your heart's aspirations.  Sure there would be criticisms. But if you always avoid them, then you will never be truly happy.  As one famous person said, "There is a sure way to avoid criticisms, be nothing and do nothing. This remedy never fails." True enough.  Take my case.  When I was in first year college, my dad wanted me to shift my course to Physical Therapy because it was in demand in the United States at that time. But I wanted to continue my studies in Accountancy. I remained firm with my decision and after some negotiations they finally gave in.  Then there's my love life. Chinese tradition states that Chinese people marry their own kind. (No offense) But I fell madly in love with this Filipino girl. Despite all the criticisms, discouragement, and harsh words (pardon me), I defended my love for her. Right now we're going strong and my relatives have respected my decision.  You see, if I have given up easily in any of the two scenarios, I would've deprived myself of joy and contentment in my life.  Sometimes other people's words would cut like a knife. But never be disheartened. Listen to the voice inside of you. We will never be able to satisfy everybody because each of us is unique. We have our own distinct traits and values. Respect for each other's opinions should be upheld.  With that said, I would like to leave this final message that sums it all up. Follow your heart and happiness will follow.
